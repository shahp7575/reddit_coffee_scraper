Got spooked given the timing and texted my husband to let him know what was happening. After like 30 minutes I felt one in my lower back, like an all around back tightening and soreness. This didn’t feel Braxton hicks like at all. Then I got one sharp stabbing one in my lower abdomen that made me shriek and hop out of the bath and start hyperventilating a bit.

Practical Tips for Choosing the Perfect Pouf Ottoman for Your Space
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Choosing the right pouf ottoman for your space can elevate the look and functionality of your room. A round pouf ottoman is especially versatile, serving as both a stylish accessory and a practical solution for seating or footrest needs. Use these tips to ensure you make the perfect choice.

### Consider the Size of Your Space

First, assess the dimensions of the area where you plan to place the pouf ottoman. A small room may benefit from a compact design, while a more spacious area can accommodate larger pieces. Keep these considerations in mind:

Check Details Here: https://homeandgardendreams.com/redearth-·-round-pouf-ottoman  
  
- **Room Dimensions:** Measure your space accurately to know what fits without overwhelming the area.
- **Proportions:** Choose a pouf that complements your existing furniture in size and shape.
- **Furniture Arrangement:** Consider how the pouf ottoman will be used in relation to other items in your room.

### Think About Functionality

A round pouf ottoman can serve multiple purposes. Understanding how you intend to use it will help shape your selection process:

- **Footrest:** If you want it primarily as a footrest, ensure it's sturdy enough to provide the support you need.
- **Extra Seating:** Look for designs that can accommodate guests comfortably without compromising style.
- **Decorative Element:** Choose colors and patterns that enhance the overall aesthetic of your room.

### Material Matters

Selecting the right material for your round pouf ottoman is essential, as it impacts both the look and durability. Here are a few popular options:

Check Details Here: https://homeandgardendreams.com/redearth-·-round-pouf-ottoman  
  
- **Fabric:** Soft and inviting, fabric poufs come in various colors and textures, making them perfect for cozy environments.
- **Leather:** Opt for leather poufs if you prefer a sophisticated, modern touch. They are easy to clean and incredibly durable.
- **Knitted or Woven:** For a boho vibe, consider a knitted or woven pouf that adds a casual flair to your decor.

### Color and Pattern Choices

The color and pattern of your round pouf ottoman play a crucial role in tying a room together. Here are some tips for making the right choice:

- **Coordinate with Your Palette:** Select a color that complements or contrasts the hues in your room for a cohesive look.
- **Patterns:** If your room has many patterns, a solid color pouf might be the way to go. For minimalistic spaces, a patterned pouf can act as an eye-catching focal point.
- **Seasonal Options:** Consider having a few poufs in different colors to swap out seasonally. This allows you to refresh your space without a complete overhaul.

### Check the Weight and Portability

If you plan to move your pouf ottoman around frequently, consider its weight. Lightweight options are easier to reposition, whereas heavier types provide more stability. Look for poufs with handles or ones that are designed for quick and easy mobility. This functionality is especially beneficial in multi-use spaces or smaller rooms.

- **Quality vs. Cost:** Don't compromise on quality to save money. Invest in a pouf that combines durability and style.
- **Shop Around:** Compare prices from different retailers to find the best possible deal.
- **Sales and Discounts:** Keep an eye out for seasonal sales or promotions that can help you snag a great deal.

By considering size, functionality, material, color, weight, and budget, you can confidently choose the perfect redearth round pouf ottoman for your space. This addition can transform your room into a practical and stylish environment, enhancing your overall living experience.

1grk2ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty/comments/1grk2ai/storytime_long_post_about_my_first_date_in_decades/,Storytime. Long post about my first date in decades...,"I don’t really have any burning questions, but thought I’d share the experience FWIW (or for entertainment) and gather any helpful feedback. I'm a man, just turned 62, widowed a couple of years ago after being together since youth. About ten months ago, I noticed that the active grieving was behind me. The indicator was the emergent desire and ability to start thinking intentionally about the future instead of always being wistful about the past. 

Another realization: living alone, every day is pretty much the same from one to the next. I’ve settled into a routine where I just optimize my current situation while enjoying my comfortable serenity. I’m aware that I could stagnate and stop growing as a person without someone else in my life to react to and plan with. I started thinking about dating, that I’d be open to dating, but hadn’t actually taken concrete action to go on any dates.

Then about two months ago, a change catalyst randomly appeared in my life. I met a married couple who came out to my house to buy something I had for sale. I instantly liked them and they liked me. They were a few years older than me, just the kindest people, down-to-earth, yet educated and cultured. We had such easy conversation. The woman learned about my widower status. They were clearly interested in learning more about my lifestyle and interests, so I showed them around. It was nice to meet such friendly people and have them take a sincere interest in me. 

A couple days later, we saw each other again to finalize the sale, and the lady asked me to tell her more about what happened to my wife, which I did. A little while later she said, “I’ve never asked anybody anything like this, but are you dating or seeing anyone?” I said, “No, but I’ve been giving it some thought.” She told me that she had a divorced friend 53F living in another part of the country (geographically and culturally) who had told her, “If you happen to meet a nice single man 55-65, let me know.” I said sure, I’d be interested in learning more about this person. I asked about her personality (“kind”, “nurturing”, “cheerful”). I asked the husband what she looked like. He described her and said, “She’s petty!” “Easy to talk to?” “She’s outgoing. You won’t have any trouble.”

The matchmaker sent me a link to an interesting article in a magazine that showcased this woman’s amazing lifestyle and talents, although there was no picture of her. Still, I was very intrigued. I liked these nice people, and if she also liked them, and they liked both of us, we might like each other.

I went to dinner with the couple about a week later, where we got to know each other better. I was aware that I was being interviewed, but I also learned more about her friend.  The next day, the matchmaker shared one photo each direction; we both liked the other’s photo. We never communicated with each other directly; everything was through the matchmaker. A week later, the matchmaker told me that she’d suggested a weekend date itinerary (here!) to her friend, who agreed to fly in. I said I’ll clear my schedule. A weekend was selected and the woman booked her flights (!).  
  
The date was set for about four weeks out. I really went to work accelerating some maintenance & upkeep projects around here, cleaned like a madman (I’m already neat, but I went to the next level of tidiness), and generally making the place look its best. I felt electrified by the anticipation of her visit and realized that this newfound energy was exactly what the doctor ordered to get me out of my routine and into high gear.

The woman flew in early one afternoon to stay the weekend at her friends’ house. I arrived there on time later that evening, to do the initial meeting, whereafter we would go to dinner as a group. The couple was still getting ready, so the woman opened the door and showed me in. 

The initial meeting was kind of stiff and awkward for both of us. There was no quick hug or even a handshake. She stood back as I entered the room, and then busied herself managing the couple's jumping little dog. I figured it was the sheer novelty of the situation and the six weeks of buildup, and also that the couple was not there to formally introduce us so we could ease into the conversation. I was sharply dressed in a well-fitting blazer, crisp dress shirt, and tailored slacks with some stylish shoes, whereas she was in a rather casual denim dress and calf-high boots. I think she was expecting more casual from me and I was expecting dressier from her. Oops! 

I’m not tall, but she was shorter than me, so that worked well. She was cute, rather different than my “type” in several regards, but objectively attractive. I had already told myself that I’m looking for a person, not a type. She looked older than 53…I thought she looked about five to seven years older than that. By appearances, we made a nicely matched couple.

Gradually we started breaking the ice and making small talk about the easiest subject, pets. The other couple finally came out to “rescue” us and off we went to the restaurant in their car. I was disconcerted by the cool greeting, because I had expected more smiling, more warmth, and more openness.

When we sat down at the table for dinner, I leaned over and quietly asked her if I could pay for all her expenses for the weekend, since she’d paid for the airfare. She instantly said no rather firmly. I must’ve looked surprised; she went on to explain that no one had ever offered to pay for her and she wasn’t expecting it. I said that’s fine, I just wanted to extend the offer. Then she semi-apologized and said she didn’t handle that very well. I said, seriously, don’t worry about it. When the check arrived, it was out of my reach; she snatched it and slapped down her credit card to pay for the whole table. I should mention at this point that this woman has substantial means, so maybe she felt compelled? Or was it more of a control move? I didn’t know, and I didn’t fight it. She wants to pay? She can pay.

We had a nice dinner, but afterward I felt a bit exhausted by the effort to keep up the meandering small talk (I’m quite social but essentially introverted, so it’s an energy drain unless I know people well, or unless the people are intellectually fascinating). It was also little tough because my date’s attention was split between me and her friend. The conversation was jumping around all over the place, and when they reminisced about their past vacations together, I didn’t have much to contribute. When I got home, I poured a double and then went to bed.

The next day, I arrived early in the morning at their house again, on time, whence we would drive to an all-day outdoor event together. No one was around when I arrived, but the door was left ajar, so I let myself in and took a seat. I probably waited fifteen minutes. After seeing the mismatch the previous night, I switched up my plans for attire and left my sport coat & dress shirt in the closet, opting instead for a crisp polo with tailored slacks, bright-colored socks, sport oxfords, and a sharp windbreaker. She came out first, dressed somewhat casually in fashion jeans, wide belt, wispy blouse, and open-toed platform shoes. The venue we were going to doesn’t have a dress code, but they do ask the guests to dress sharply, even with a bit of whimsy (hence my socks). Although the quality of her outfit was good, I feared she would feel underdressed in terms of style when she saw the crowd. 

This time our greeting was warmer and more familiar, and we went to the kitchen for coffee, pastries, and chat. We found out we had some unexpected things in common and the conversation flowed more easily. It helped immensely that it was just the two of us. We continued in the car and it kept getting more interesting as she shared more things about her upbringing, family, and current lifestyle. I started to see some humor. She learned a lot more about me as well. I realized I was beginning to like her. We had some differences in lifestyle: she doesn’t need to work, she likes doing sports, she jets around frequently, and is still pretty involved with her grown kids, whereas I have a job, I like doing physical work on my property that results in some tangible result, I’m into working on my vehicles & equipment, and I don't have tons of contact with my kids. But we are both well-traveled, albeit she at a far higher level than me. Nevertheless, I could easily hold my own with her culturally, particularly in terms of European culture, where I have years of business experience.

Once we arrived at the outdoor event, it got hard to talk again in all the hubbub. We couldn’t really focus on each other in any depth, so we just had fun engaging in the activities of the event and making small talk. As the day wore on, her attention became more occupied by her talkative friend. I started to feel a bit like I’d been the bait to get her to come here to visit the matchmaker. There was an instance where I was able to bring up the subject of plans or aspirations for the future. We made some headway there, but it was again cut short by some interruption. 

That night we went to a very upscale restaurant, and I regretted my decision to eschew the sport coat and dress shirt. The conversation flowed a lot better with the wine, and I started to wonder if my date was simply a bit shy or lacking confidence, and the wine was fortifying for both of us. I got the impression she had also not been on any (or few) dates and was out of practice, too, although the subject didn’t explicitly come up on either side.

The day after that, they came out to my place for the grand tour (I live on property). I gave them the complete private tour of everything. She got a very clear picture of how I live and what I have. There was one outdoor activity that I hadn’t planned, but was pleasantly surprised that she wanted to try, after the couple suggested it. She turned out to be pretty good at it, even though she had little experience. We were blessed with perfect weather all weekend, so it was truly ideal. We were all dressed informally for the first time, and I could tell that my date was much more relaxed and comfortable in this setting. We had a pretty good time and started joking around and so on, but she always kept her physical distance and never really flirted with or touched me. Still, it was much better.

That evening at the house, I laid out a spread of charcuterie, fresh berries, a unique dip, crackers, and imported cheeses with a rather nice bottle of Bordeaux red. I don’t pretend to know much about wines, but I figured it’s hard to go wrong with a good bottle of French red. It went over well; she's a connoisseur and her favorite is French red, so I felt pretty smug that she was impressed. The conversation over the cheese & wine was fun, although she sat at the far end of my oval table. I brought out a special dessert snack I’d made (I don’t really cook, but I’m not wholly incompetent) and that was a big hit. Throughout the evening, I simply enjoyed watching her and listening to her; I was keenly aware of her physical presence in my house. She was sitting right there in my kitchen!

When they went to leave, I was quite astonished when she suddenly threw her arms around me and gave me long, close, warm embrace. I have to admit that it felt damned good to have her in my arms, with her hair against my face! No kiss, but I figured that’s because it would have been awkward with the other couple standing right there. Still, I wondered if a little peck would not have been inappropriate.

The next day, she texted effusive thanks and compliments about me and my hosting as she boarded the plane home. The text was very glowing and encouraging; she listed off everything we’d done and built up the success of weekend quite a bit. I texted back my appreciation and offered my equally effusive compliments. I told her I want to know more about her, and that I’d like to see her again. She replied graciously that she didn’t think she merited all of the compliments I’d sent, but that they were appreciated, and said “Talk soon.” I sent back some photos of the weekend and some other things about my life that she might be interested in, and she praised the pics and thanked me for them.

There was a period of quiet the next day, and I realized maybe it was “my turn”, so I texted and told her how amazed I was that the weekend came together & that she had made the trip here, and that when we were having cheese & wine, I kept thinking to myself, “I can’t believe she’s sitting right here in my kitchen!” And I told her how the anticipation of her visit had energized me, confirming that I need someone in my life to give me purpose, to spur me to accomplish more, and generally inspire me to be a better man.

Twenty-four hours went by with no reply. Then forty-eight. Finally, I texted a picture of me doing an activity and said, “Hey, here’s what I’m doing today. How are you? Looking forward to talking with you.”

The reply came back a couple of hours later. Very polite salutation, more compliments (only this time kind of “friend zoning”), and the news that she’d decided not to pursue a relationship, she hoped I’d understand, and wished me the best. I texted back politely and said I wish it were otherwise, but I understand, and that it had been a long shot anyway. I wished her well, and that was that.

I don’t know if I blew it somehow (did I come on too strong, or not strong enough?), or if she felt like the chemistry was lacking, or maybe she just made up her mind on other considerations, like how to integrate two lives that are really quite different. I was willing to put more time & effort into it, particularly since we really hadn't had almost any 1:1 time all weekend, to see where we could take it. Maybe it wouldn't get off the ground. Or maybe it would, but down the road there would need to be adjustments or even wholesale changes, which I was open to, but I think some people won’t even start a relationship if they can’t visualize the way it would work out in the long run, especially if it doesn't fit into the plans they already have laid out and they are not flexible.",1,1731631507.0,datingoverfifty,1,1.0,False

It was supposed to be a simple, convenient, and stress-free grocery delivery. I had just finished a long day at work, the last thing I wanted was to fight traffic or navigate crowded aisles. So, naturally, I turned to Instacart, confident that this modern solution would save me time and energy. Oh, how wrong I was.

I placed my order—nothing extravagant, just the basics. Milk, eggs, some fresh vegetables, a loaf of bread. I even opted for the ""Express Delivery"" because, well, I'm a busy person and I'd like to have my groceries in under two hours, thank you very much.

The app gave me an estimated delivery time of 30 minutes. Fine, I thought, I’ll just relax for a bit and catch up on my shows. Fast forward to an hour later: no update, no message, no sign of the driver. I check the app. ""Your order is being shopped."" Okay, no big deal, I’m sure they’re just busy. But then, another 30 minutes pass. Now it’s been 90 minutes, and still nothing. I check again: ""Your order is being shopped.""

At this point, I'm starting to feel the anger rising, but I try to keep calm. I mean, it’s just groceries, right? How hard can it be to pick out some eggs and bread? I tap on the app to send a message to my shopper. ""Hey, is everything okay?"" I get a reply a minute later: ""Hi! Sorry, there was a slight delay. I’m almost done!""

Slight delay? It’s been over 90 minutes! But whatever, maybe they’re having trouble finding something. I try to relax again.

Another 30 minutes go by. Now it’s been 2 hours since I placed the order. At this point, I'm pacing around my living room, gritting my teeth, and texting my friends who are all living their best lives while I’m here, trapped in my own personal grocery hell. I check the app again. ""Your order is being shopped."" What does that even mean? Why is it taking this long? What are they doing in the aisles, sitting down for a cup of coffee and discussing the meaning of life? This is literally the most basic list of items ever!

Then, the notification arrives. ""Your order is on its way!"" Praise the delivery gods! Finally, this nightmare is coming to an end. I brace myself for the delivery, imagining the sweet relief of my groceries arriving.

Five minutes later, the doorbell rings.

I open the door, and there it is. My delivery.

But wait... something’s off.

Instead of fresh produce, there’s a bag of wilted, brown spinach. The eggs? Cracked open and leaking all over the bottom of the bag. And the milk? Not even the right brand. It’s some generic off-brand that looks like it came from a sketchy corner store. I can’t believe my eyes.

I immediately open the app to report the issue. The app asks me to rate my delivery. Are you *kidding* me? I want to scream, but I calmly give it one star, explaining that my groceries are ruined, the items are all wrong, and I waited *two hours* for this?

I also removed my $1 tip.  Everyone knows those fees go to the drivers.  What sucker tips before receiving?

The response? “Sorry for the inconvenience. Please allow us up to 48 hours to process your refund.”

I lost it. I started typing a furious message, detailing my rage, but realized that no amount of typing could undo the damage that this app had done to my evening. Two hours of waiting. Two hours of hoping for a simple delivery. And what did I get? A grocery disaster.

Instacart, if you're listening, I swear I’ll never order from you again. You had one job.

I had been experiencing symptoms of heartburn and poor digestion for a few months. I took omeprazole and aluminum hydroxide to alleviate the sensation, but after a while the symptoms got worse and I finally made an appointment. I had an endoscopy and test for h. pylore. tested positive for h. pylore and chronic gastritis was detected. I'm finishing the first week of 14 days of treatment and I already feel better. But I can't eat in large quantities and I've cut out coffee, soda and alcoholic drinks altogether. 

I confess that I'm afraid that when I finish treatment all the symptoms will return and I feel like I'll never be able to drink alcohol or other things that are bad for my stomach again. I feel like my lifestyle is going to change. So my tip is: see your doctor and have an endoscopy. I spent months avoiding going and things could be better now. In 4 months I will go back to the doctor to redo the tests. I hope to be free from this bacteria.",2,1731630895.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

1grjr5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPD/comments/1grjr5c/pretentiousness/,Pretentiousness,"*Pretentious: attempting to impress by affecting greater importance, talent, culture, etc., than is actually possessed.* 

I used to be quite pretentious. 

In trying to understand myself better, I'm kind of drawing some realizations and connections between past pretentious behaviors, the kind of identity I was trying to create and present to the world, and my own insecurity and lack of identity/emptiness. 

Writing this is largely a process for myself, however I'm curious if anyone else can relate to some of these experiences (or if I am just alone in my craziness). 

When I was in my early days of going to college, I took an introductory philosophy course, and found it fascinating. 

I think my fascination with it was genuine. I wasn't trying to impress anybody by becoming more intellectual, I wasn't using this knowledge to somehow portray myself in a certain light. I think I just really enjoyed exploring those perennial questions about life, existence, the nature of reality, and so on.

Fast forward five years or so, I'm sitting in a coffee shop by myself. I'm wearing my vintage leather floresheims, my hair is long, and I have a messenger bag full of ""hip"" philosophy books. 

I was reading mostly continental philosophy at that time, but highly-particularized brands of it: Postmodernism, Post-structuralism, Critical Theory, Deconstructionism, Marx, Derrida, Foucault, Baudrillard. I was reading fashionable philosophy, stuff written by the French, thick books with provocative names like ""The History of Madness"". 

I don't think I ever finished one of them. 

Anyways, as I'm sitting there trying to understand a page-long sentence written by Fredrick Jameson, my eyes frequently scan the room. Who is watching me? Are there any attractive females watching me? Does anyone notice what I'm reading? 

(Cringe.)

The coffee shop was located next to a big university, which I did not attend. The coffee shop was full of university students, so yes, there were attractive females around, but they weren't there to make conversation or socialize-- they were focused on their schoolwork, they had their eyes glued to their laptops, text books, and futures. I didn't exist, as I shouldn't have. 

Most of the books I was ""reading"" were books on political philosophy. I was a radical leftist at the time, so a large amount of what I read was based on Marxism, communism, anarcho-syndicalism. 

If you would have met me at that time, you would have met someone who seemed to fervently care about politics, who had strong opinions and political beliefs, who would seem to really care about the world. 

But it wasn't the world I was caring about. 

It was my own idealized image of myself, my own fantasy about who I wanted to be seen as and who I was ""becoming""--someone intellectual and smart, someone that possessed a deeper-than-thou understanding of what was going on in the world, someone cultured and who had interesting things to say, and so forth.

I had little care for what ACTUALLY was happening in the world around me. If you would have asked me about current events, I would have been pretty much clueless and unconsciously try to direct the conversation to the necessity for some kind of theoretical exploration about something to avoid looking like a complete idiot and fraud. 

It was all a fantasy. A fantasy about who I might become, not about who I really was, which was a deeply traumatized, deeply insecure, frightened little child that knew next-to-nothing about the real world.

Collapse has a way of shelling-out pretty much everything you once believed about yourself. I look at all the books I've picked up but never finished, all of the different clothes I have worn throughout the years, all of these superficial aesthetics, these weird, idealized objects and fascinations for things I used to concern myself with, and they all feel foreign to me. None of them have ever felt like ""me"". 

I see how it all was repeated attempts at the same thing: trying to forge an identity that felt good enough to me to be deserving of love. 

It's all so fucking confusing and sad. 

How do I draw the difference between something that I truly am curious about and interested in, and something that only serves to fulfill a function of my ego? 

What the fuck is ME? What the fuck do I really care about? How do I figure that out? 

Why couldn't I have had a normal upbringing where I was seen and loved for who I was, encouraged to explore what I really cared about towards having an integrated and authentic sense of self, not be perpetually stuck in the mind of child who can only dream about what he might someday become without ever becoming anything, who cannot even determine what he likes, who now has inherent distrust anything that he MIGHT like or enjoy because it all seems selfish and self-serving and ego-driven and false?

I don't know how to ""be"" with others anymore. I don't trust myself anymore. I don't trust that any part of me is real. 

I want to be real. I just want to be fucking REAL.

We're using a proprietary software which is pretty old so you need to save before exiting the program. In this instance, the group members has ""accidentally"" deleted everything because they forgot to save their work before exiting, thus causing everything to be wiped/set to default(don't ask me how). This has happened twice already and I have to clean up after them and redo everything. I emailed the professor about this and they just said to ask other groups for help and document who did what part of the work.   
  
The professor does not want to be involved in this and expects other students to practically be my group members to recover lost progress. I am so lost now and I've just told my own group members to fuck off and don't touch the program without my supervision. I am so lost on what I should even do. I act as the group leader, planning everything, teaching them what to do for their section, and they still fuck up. I had to miss 1 class due to personal reasons and told the professor and my group at least 2 weeks in advance, and when it came time for them to give me a rundown on what we did in class they were not able to recite even 1 topic fully, which made me have to go ask a random person from the class to help me(I bought them coffee afterwards). I am trying so hard to keep the group afloat but they are like shards of glass, waiting to cut me whenever I do anything with them. 

  
To top it all off, these were preassigned groups so I don't even get a say in anything. I am on the verge of straight up shouting at them in class, but my rationality is telling me that's gonna have consequences. I have 2 other group assignments which I am fine with because even though I'm still the group leader, they follow what I tell them to do to a tee and doesn't triple my workload every other week.

1grjlmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1grjlmi/its_been_a_journey/,It's been a journey,"Hi all,

I am a 42YO male. A few years ago (about 2020), I was advised by my GP that my cholesterol is high, we are talking total cholesterol 8.4 mmol/L. High cholesterol does run in the family so I think it is genetic. Although my diet and exercise routine at the time was non existent

I had to either get it down by the next GP visit, or I was to start medication. Naturally, starting medication was not something I wanted to do unless completely necessary after all other means of lowering cholesterol were attempted. 

This sent me on a fitness and diet journey, and quite a journey it has been. 

At the time I was about 94kgs, not muscle mind you. So I started exercising most days of the week. I did a lot of F45 and dropped a lot of weight and was the fittest I’ve ever been. Nowadays I only run, no weight training at all. 4-5 days a week I run about 4kms a day, slowly starting to increase that distance and currently doing about 6kms a day.

Additionally I walk quite a bit also, about 10k steps a day, and after the run about 15k-16k steps a day.

My diet is very strict, the cheat meals I have will be a family members Birthday and Christmas Day. The rest of the time I am consistent and strict.

My weight now days floats around 72-73kg and has done for a couple of years. So about 22kg weight loss.

**My strict diet means I don't consume:**

Dairy, red meat, soft drinks, coffee, sugar, high in sat. fat foods, anything fried.

**Regulars in my diet are:**

Extra virgin olive oil (1 tablespoon every morning before breakfast)

High fibre breakfast (Weetbix with flaxseed meal, chia, psyllium husk)

Steel cut oats

Fruits

Vegetables

Salmon twice a week

Chicken

Beans

Green tea

Almond milk / oat milk - unsweetened

Dark rye bread

Rice

The blood results I think are really good. I need to work on raising HDL, and will find a way to so so with food. I think I could eat more good fat foods. Happy for anyone here to offer advice on that.

I just wanted to share with you all what is possible with a good diet and nutrition, and if any of this information helps even just 1 person, that's amazing.

**\* The image only shows results going back until 2022, when I also managed to get my cholesterol to a good level the first time. Prior to this my total cholesterol was 8.4 mmol/L.**

The dining area is a natural fit for bar stools. Here are a few ideas to make the most of them:

- **Mix and Match:** Pair your Sweetcrispy bar stools with a rustic wooden table for a casual yet stylish vibe. The contrast enhances the overall appeal, making the area welcoming for family gatherings.
- **Breakfast Nook:** If you have an island or a breakfast bar, arrange the stools around it. This setup instantly turns your kitchen into a social hub, perfect for quick breakfasts or evening chats.
- **Color Coordination:** Choose a set that complements your dining chairs or table. Harmonizing colors create a seamless look that feels intentional and curated.

### Living Room Comfort

Consider using your bar stools beyond the dining area. They can be functional and stylish in your living room too:

- **Accent Pieces:** Arrange the Sweetcrispy bar stools around a coffee table. Use them as additional seating when hosting friends or for family game nights. This adds a fun and relaxed feel to your entertaining space.
- **Side Tables:** When not in use for seating, place a tray on a bar stool to create a makeshift side table for drinks or snacks. This allows for flexibility, offering a spot for décor items, books, or remotes.

### Home Office Opportunities

Using bar stools in a home office may seem unconventional, but it can enhance your workspace:

- **Stand-Up Desks:** If you have a stand-up desk, a bar stool can provide a quick seating option when you need a break from standing. It keeps the flow of energy while also supporting productivity.
- **Creative Meetings:** If you host meetings at home, using bar stools can inject a modern feel into your office. They encourage active participation and interaction among attendees.

### Outdoor Spaces

- **Alfresco Dining:** If you have an outdoor bar or a high-top table, your bar stools are perfect for enjoying meals outside. Set up a charming area with string lights for evening dinners.
- **Fire Pits:** Use the stools around a fire pit to create a gathering spot on chilly evenings. Their height allows everyone to enjoy the warmth while having their drinks close by.

### Entryways and Hallways

Do you have a narrow entryway or a hallway? Don’t overlook the advantage of bar stools here:

- **Quick Drop-off:** Utilize a stool near the entrance for quick drop-offs of bags or coats. Insert a small table near it for added convenience.
- **Functional Decor:** Style it with a chic cushion and a decorative throw. This small touch can add character and be a stylish way to welcome guests.

I want to be able to enter a text like “I spent $4 in a coffee shop named Baltazar and I paid with credit” or another example could be “yesterday I spent $15 in a T-shirt, With cash” 

in the first case I want the app/ai to be able to recognize and categorize that that money was spent  in food. And in the second case ;without me even saying it) I needed to categorize it as clothes AND that it was yesterday. Categorization set up is not something that would bother me doing manually the first time, so for example, if I connect coffee shop with food, whenever I say, I spend money on a coffee shop, it should be categorized as food.
On the other hand, my final idea is to export all that to an excel, to be able to analyze it later on, or even if the app itself has some analysis on the go or graphs available. It would be great, but both options are good

1grjc10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1grjc10/aita_my_mother_said_to_a_friend_of_mine_she_just/,"AITA my mother said to a friend of mine she just met ""I'm sorry I gave birth to her"",😳","So, I am a AH,  but not to warrent that statement. 

thus is a LONG WINDED post, my apologies.

Back ground story. My parents split when I was young, I am the youngest daughter but not the youngest child. My little brother was born from my mothers new bf, he was abusive to my mother & I called the police so many times on him. When my mother was at work, my little brother was not even 2 yrs old, he would cry & my step father would slap the shit out of him. After a few times I started stepping in to piss him off so he would hit me n not my little brother. I told my mother this was happening and he was abusive to me n my little bro and her response the majority of the time was "" would did you do to deserve it"" or ""Maybe you should stop being a brat"". I started rebelling and being a AH of a child. Years go by & this continues, one day he came home drunk, mum n him got in an argument and he threw boiling hot coffee on her. I'd had enough, called the cops but got yelled at by my mother for doing so. I started running away at the age of 13, lived on the streets & halfway houses. Just being a very rebellious teen. One night I came back late from hanging out with friends and my mum slapped the bajesus out of me and called me a slut! I was a Virgin. Not long after that I started having sex n fell pregnant first time. I ended up having 3 kids to this guy, 13 yrs later we separated. After a court battle(my ex took me to and lost) we calmed down and we chat occasionally,  we chat like mates do now. I eneded up falling pregnant to another man and had twins, 2.5 yrs go by, myself & my partner had a fight one night. I said I was going out with a friend and staying at her place down the road. I received a phone call from a niece of mine that was living with us saying that he is gone and so is your car and the twins are crying in their cot. I sprinted home only to find my babies crying, house in shambles. He left with my car I just brought (it was in his name as I had no licence)all my kids money boxes empty, my Eddie Charlton cew signed gone, my 200pce Kinchrome tool box and tools gone. I had a metal breakdown, my best friend picked me up off the front yard ground and took me inside. I started drinking almost every night. Put the kids to bed and I would ask my room mate to keep an ear on the kids. I was never more then 15min drive away, but I knew I needed help. I ask my Mother if she could take my kids for me until I got myself together, she agreed and said to me ""when your ready, just ask and you can have the kids back"". Fast forward a year & i was back to my normal self. I moved closer to my kids and mother. Within 1 year of living closer , I lived with my brother n friend. They broke the lease, got all of us kicked out, and I ended up having to pay off the damages them two caused as my name was down on the lease so I was also held accountable. I asked my brother to help pay off the debt cause I need to find a place to rent for myself and my kids and this will put me on the blacklist. My brothers reply shocked the shit out of me! His response""fuck you & ya kids!"", I will never forget them words. I snapped, that's it, I looked at my mother she said ""I don't wanna know its between you two"". I replied, ""that's it, im gonna save some money take my kids somewhere where it snows in the winter"". (Which is a long way from my mother and brother)

She took me to court straight away, and because she is living at my sisters house which is big enough to accommodate everyone and I just had a small as 2 bed unit, she won. I kept in contact with my kids and when my daughter was 15 she wanted to move back in with me, my mother could not stop her at this point, my mother looked at my daughter and said "" you will be pregnant just like ya mother if you move in with her!""

Myself and my kids can talk to each other just about anything, I've told my kids when u decide just let me know ill get you protection & or birth control.. Most of my kids have rang me up just to tell me where they are when they was under-age drinking(in my mother's care) ...even rang me to inform me they are no longer virgin's. My responses to them was"" did you wear a raincoat?, how are you feeling about it? Etc(BTW my daughter is now 24 and still has never fell pregnant!)

Anyway, pass a few more yrs and one of my twins has run away from my sisters place and my mother;  I received a phone call from my mother screaming"" his just like you"" and a few other choice put downs toward me, then told me what happened, I expressed that I will call a few mates in the area to look out for him but if you keep talking to me like shit im hanging up, she did, I hangup. (He couldn't have gone far he was on crutches!, but ok, let's panic. My sisters house is on acerage on one long street btw)he couldn't have got far even if he tried. I rang my son but no answer, I smsed him and said "" im not sure what's going on but just let me know your ok, if you need to talk give me a call, love you baby"". I received a phone call from him (after he went back home, after my mother rang to inform me his back and call me more choice names) ...he accused me of paedophilia toward him and his twin brother when they was young!!!😳😳😳😳 I beg your finest pardon!!! We haven't spoken to each other much since that phone call and our relationship will never be the same. I had my daughter & his twin brother asking me if I am ok, ""we don't know what his talking about"" etc....his twin brother is not happy I am still talking to his brother in his words "" mum he couldve completely ruined your life! Ya job as a disability carer/nurse even ya chef job, wouldve been gone!""

I know his not wrong. Anyway fast forward to this month. A best mate of mine was in the cafe where myself and one of my son works. My son introduced my friend to my mother (that she has never met)my friend said ""Hello, im blank, im a friend of your daughters""

My mother apologised for him being friends with me and when my friend asked why she said""you don't know her like I do"" my friend stated his known me for many many years, her response"" well, my sorry I even gave birth to her, I wish I didnt"". 

My friend was wide eyed, looked at my son and said he had to leave. My mate called me straight away and told me what happened, I said "" yep, that sounds about right."" My friends response""i can understand why you call her dragon lady now"".

Since my son accused me of that absolutely discussing act, I haven't spoken to him or my mother much, I don't go to family dinners, visit or Christmas any longer. My mother has asked my son to invite me but I refuse to put myself in that completely uncomfortable situation.

In November 2020 I first felt my lower right eyelid twitch. And it still twitches to this day. 

I twitch began during a stressful time in my life. I had a few years of stress and anxiety and a bit of burnout in my job. 

I went to a doctor who referred me to a neurologist. They just did general body checks   and assured me that I don't have any serious neurological condition.

I'm generally very healthy and don't get sick often. 
I still get stressed from time to time but I'm much better than before. 
I generally sleep at least 7 hours a night and don't drink coffee. 
The eye twitch is irritating however. 
I don't notice it all the time but definitely every day or every other day.

1grj7w0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1grj7w0,Stood Up/Unmatched Before Date,"This has happened more than once unfortunately but you know I'm pretty tired of this and people getting away with it so lemme start: Last Sunday I saw a guy liked my picture on Hinge but I didn't noticed too much until later in the day, we matched, we started talking and we actually chatted a lot actually. Got to know each other and continue to chat after my shift. He's fairly attractive, I was interested and at the time while texting he seemed so too. Calling me cutie, attractive, so on. (I didn't screenshot the conversations but man I wish. Next time)

Next day Monday I sent him a good morning text and he did too and after that, that's where it started to get iffy. Now i understand if you don't have time to text the morning cause he works, he works as a legal analyst at an investment bank so l could imagine he gets busy, but I didn't get a text back until like 7ish pm, I texted him like twice after just saying I found a place for our date, hope he's having a great day that's it. He responded saying he's been busy and he still is after getting home but he's still down to meet tomorrow (Tuesday) and I just informed him the place I picked, a nice Italian restaurant in the west village and he was down!
Didn't hear from him till the day of the date.

Now I texted him good morning can't wait to see him and he responded saying sorry he hasn't been responding a lot and that he can't wait either, and he'll text me later. Great, he feels the same way and he informed me that he'll text me later and we're set for later today. I texted him saying no worries I'll see you later and also gave him my number just in case it's easier to reach me idk sometimes dating apps are iffy when it comes to receiving notifications.
We arranged to meet at 7pm and I left my place around 5:30pm. I was ready, happy, excited and omw I kept looking at his profile and our conversation just in case he responded or the worst case scenario (which is literally happened) and it's still visible, got to the west village with some time to spare and decide to walk around for a bit. Saw Hinge and his profile is still there. 6:30 rolls and I'm walking towards the Italian restaurant and decided to text him until i realized he unmated me. No text, hits straight up unmatched for no reason.

My delusion ass thought that maybe he kept my number and decides to text me there instead and something happened to his hinge. 7pm came and I was waiting in the cold across from the restaurant to see if he would surprise me and show up. And nothing. 7:15pm. Nothing. 7:30pm I decided to go to a coffee shop that was still open until 8 and sat there to look at the window and see if I see a bold 5'9 guy. Nothing. It sucked yes but I didn't let that ruin my free night. I saw venom 3 afterwards. I'm so sick and tired of looking for love in a city where I live that apparently seems impossible to get when you're gay, in your mid-late 20s and lives in NYC.
And I'm tired of people getting away with it.

Idk if he was a real person or just used someone else's pics to talk to me. Apparently he also has a Reddit account which I realized afterwards. But I'm done. If you know anything about this man or even know if he's real or a fake, Imk! Or comment down below.
His name is Joseph, moved from Cali to NYC beginning of this year, he's 30, Hispanic, lives around Ridaewood in Queens and is Bisexual.  I only was able to find him on hinge not sure if he's on other dating apps. Apparently I remember he saids he's been on dates before just never worked out with any of em. I can see why. I'm not sure what l'll gain from this, I legit tried to be nice and understanding and genuinely was excited to see him. Maybe just a warning to anyone if you do come across his profile and match with him and decide to go on a date. He might unmatch you last minute.

1grj5vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFreelanceHustle/comments/1grj5vm/taming_the_chaos_building_a_sustainable_work/,Taming the Chaos: Building a Sustainable Work Routine as a Virtual Assistant," 

https://preview.redd.it/fok6uxwydy0e1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=12c90677f4d723dce438d366bcb4c25d9c13713e

The freedom and flexibility of being a virtual assistant are undeniable – working from anywhere, setting your own hours, and being your own boss. But with great freedom comes great responsibility, and in this case, that responsibility is to yourself. Without the structure of a traditional office, it's easy to fall into the traps of procrastination, burnout, and blurred lines between work and personal life. That's where a sustainable work routine comes in. It's your secret weapon to not just survive, but thrive in the exciting world of virtual assistance.

Think of your routine as the scaffolding that supports your workday. It provides the structure you need to stay focused, productive, and ultimately, happy. But building a routine isn't about rigid schedules and strict timetables. It's about understanding your own rhythms, identifying your peak performance times, and designing a workday that flows naturally with your energy levels.

# Know Thyself: Understanding Your Productivity Peaks and Valleys

We all have natural ebbs and flows in our energy throughout the day. Some of us are early birds, tackling our most demanding tasks before the sun's fully up. Others are night owls, hitting their stride when the world around them quiets down. The key is to identify your own ""chronotype"" – your natural tendency for sleep and wakefulness – and schedule your work accordingly.

For me, I've discovered that my brain is firing on all cylinders in the late morning. That's when I schedule tasks that require deep focus and creative thinking, like writing blog posts or developing marketing strategies for my clients. By the afternoon, my energy starts to dip, so I shift to more administrative tasks like email management and scheduling.

# The Power of Rituals: Setting the Stage for Success

Rituals are like anchors in your day, signaling to your brain that it's time to transition from one mode to another. A morning ritual could be as simple as enjoying a cup of coffee while reviewing your to-do list, or as elaborate as a full-blown workout and meditation session. The key is to find what works for you and stick with it.

One of my non-negotiable rituals is a 15-minute walk outside before I start my workday. It helps me clear my head, get some fresh air, and mentally prepare for the day ahead. I also make it a point to end my workday with a ""shutdown ritual"" – closing all my work-related tabs, tidying up my workspace, and literally switching off my computer. This signals to my brain that it's time to relax and recharge.

# Boundaries are Your Best Friend: Separating Work from Life

One of the biggest challenges of working from home is the blurring of boundaries between your professional and personal life. It's all too easy to get sucked into the ""always-on"" mentality, checking emails at dinner or responding to messages late at night. But trust me, setting clear boundaries is crucial for your sanity and your productivity.

Designate a specific workspace, even if it's just a corner of your kitchen table. This helps create a physical separation between work and relaxation. Communicate your working hours to your clients and stick to them as much as possible. And most importantly, make time for activities that have nothing to do with work – whether it's spending time with loved ones, pursuing a hobby, or simply enjoying some downtime.

# Embrace Flexibility: Your Routine Should Work for You, Not Against You

Remember, the beauty of being a virtual assistant is the flexibility it offers. Your routine should be a tool that empowers you, not a rigid set of rules that restricts you. Life happens, and there will be days when you need to deviate from your schedule. That's perfectly okay. The key is to have a solid foundation in place that you can always come back to.

# The Long Game: Building a Sustainable Future

Creating a sustainable work routine is an investment in your long-term well-being and success as a virtual assistant. It's about finding a rhythm that allows you to work efficiently, avoid burnout, and enjoy the freedom and flexibility that this career path offers. So, take the time to experiment, find what works best for you, and build a routine that supports your goals and aspirations.

1grj54o,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1grj54o/visiting_at_the_end_of_february_and_i_have_some/,Visiting At the end of February and I have some questions.,"I will be flying into Narita on Feb 17th, and taking the JR to Osaka. Then Kyoto and back to Tokyo.

I'm traveling solo. This is my first trip to Japan, not my first time traveling solo. I like to be loose with my plans and prefer to submerse myself in the culture and the places I'm visiting. All the hotels I've booked have free cancelation until early February. I'm not set on staying in any of them yet.

Due to the price increase it seems the JR Pass might not be worth it for me, any other reason I should consider getting it?  
  
Feb 17th to 19th, Osaka, Lodging - Hotel Monterey Le Frere  
No real plans except for knife shopping and exploring. Recommendations welcome

Feb 19th to 22nd Kyoto, Lodging APA Hotel Gojo Omiya  
only plans are to dine in some of the Kaiseki establishments and visit flea markets. Recommendations welcome

(I'm thinking about stopping in Fuji on my way back to Tokyo to be able to get a good view of the mountain. I'm thinking it might not be worth it, most of what I read is that it's best to catch it in the early morning hours)

Feb 22nd to Feb 27th Tokyo, Asakusa View hotel  
Glitch coffee, Kappabashi Street, clubbing

I know it's gonna be cold, are gloves recommended? I read on one site they suggested buy single use hand warmers, but I don't like the thought of producing unnecessary waste.

If I bring a reusable water bottle are there place to be able to refill it?

I'm plan on brining 3 days of clothes and doing one load of laundry when I get settled in Tokyo.

Should I bring an empty suit case to fill up or buy one at the end of the trip? If I do bring one is there a way to see if the hotels I'm staying at do luggage forwarding?

I'm in the restaurant industry, I plan on eating at as many unique restaurants that I can. I'm also going for variety and unknown places that excel at having the best ramen(or whatever) even if it's just a hole in the wall. While I don't drink much alcohol these days I still plan on visiting some craft cocktail bars.

Photography is one of my hobbies. I plan on bringing a Nikon Z6ii with a 40mm F/2. I wanted to bring some other lens but I'm trying to travel as light as possible. If any of you are photographers and have some reasons why I should consider something else I'm all ears. I also have the 23-70 f/4 and 70-200 f/2.8, but they both weight a lot more.

I wanted to try and take some classes while I was there, but the pricing is almost double unless you're doing it as a couple or small group.  Knife sharping class, cooking classes, Kintsugi class, and/or bonasi class are all things I'm interested in. Is there any insider knowledge about offerings like these? I'm also down for any tours worth taking. 

What are some made in Japan must haves? Obviously I'm already picking up knives and kitchen equipment, but what else? I've seen different things on here like umbrellas etc.

What are essentials I need to bring and what don't I need to bring since it's provided or better off purchased?

1grj483,https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/1grj483/40m_seeking_input_on_low_testosterone_levels_146/,40M seeking input on low testosterone levels (146 ng/dL),"TL;DR: 40M Testosterone test result of 146 ng/dL. Is that result so low that I have no hope of getting it up to normal (300+) levels without testosterone therapy? Read on for more details:

Had a DEXA scan a few weeks ago just to test body fat; it showed low bone density. Doctor tested my testosterone. Result was 146 ng/dL, which is pretty low. The blood was drawn 3 hours after I had completed a 1-hr zone 2 biking session, and I had also had coffee and breakfast already (overnight oats).

Doc has already referred me to an endocrinologist, but I'm sure it will be weeks if not longer before I can see the endo, so in the meantime I am wondering if I have any hope of getting that up to normal levels (300+) by natural means (i.e., no testosterone therapies) such as reduced exercise, increased calorie intake, improved sleep, etc. Or if people look at that number (146) and think it's so low that I should just go straight to testosterone supplementation if my doc recommends it.

A bit about me:

40M, 5'10, 150 lbs, 13.5% bodyfat (DEXA). Workout 4 hours zone 2 cycling per week, \~1 hour zones 3-5 (combined) per week, 3 bodyweight resistance workouts per week (olympic ring pullups, dips, rows, pushups, core, and legs), about 10k steps per day walking. I have an autoimmune disorder called anklylosing spondylitis but am otherwise healthy AFAIK. I'm not on any medications but I take a vitamin D supplement. (Vitamin D levels tested normal; in fact all bloodwork tested normal within the last year).

Over the last year I've (purposefully) lost 35 lbs (185 -> 150), and have upped my exercise, but both my weight and my exercise have been pretty stable for at least 6 months or so. I started a creatine supplement last week (doing \~3g per day, no loading phase).

Don't really have any obvious symptoms of low-T. I get about 7.5 hours of decent sleep per night. Pretty lean and muscular. My sex-drive might be a little low but not egregiously so. I do usually wake up twice per night to pee, but that's been happening for the past 20-30 years. Don't really think the volume or intensity of my workouts is terribly high. Diet is extremely clean, though perhaps I need to eat more and increase my weight and bodyfat.

Hello! I'm James, and this is Dale – my partner in crime, confidant, and the steady hand that sometimes keeps my big ideas from spiraling out of control (and other times jumps right in with me!). We've been together for over five years, and if there’s one thing we’ve learned, it’s that laughter and honesty are the glue holding us together.

**A Little About Us:** I’m the one with a head full of ideas, always dreaming up the next project, from tech tinkering to building a naturist-friendly campground. Dale? He’s the laid-back realist who keeps things grounded… most of the time. Together, we’re on this wild ride, embracing a naturist lifestyle that’s as much about freedom and connection as it is about being comfortable in our own skin.

**Why Naturism?** For both of us, naturism has been a journey of self-acceptance and authenticity. It’s less about clothes (or the lack thereof) and more about peeling back the layers of social expectations. There’s a certain vulnerability in it that reminds us to embrace who we are – flaws and all.

**What Keeps Us Laughing:** Dale’s talent for “selective hearing” when I’m planning my next grand scheme, and my tendency to take on one too many projects, lead to some funny moments. Whether it’s late-night chats in the hot tub or spontaneous road trips, we keep each other on our toes – and we wouldn’t have it any other way.

**Why We’re Here:** We’re here to connect, learn, and hopefully inspire others to join us in celebrating the beauty of authenticity and openness. Life’s too short to be anything but real, so let’s embrace the awkward, the funny, and the honest moments together.

Looking forward to meeting more people who love life, laughter, and living freely. Let’s keep things real, relaxed, and maybe even a little unpredictable. 😊",1,1731628591.0,NudistMeetup,1,1.0,False

It’s been 10 months since our breakup, and both of us have broken no contact twice. At first, I went no contact for 2.5 months and even deactivated my Instagram. Once I finally reactivated it and posted photos, he reached out, asking for his Nintendo Switch back, which was at my place. He also had mine, so I thought we’d exchange.

He came over, we exchanged our things, talked a bit, and he hugged me, saying it was nice to see me. Out of fear of the memories, I didn’t open the bag he gave me for a few days—and when I did, my Switch wasn’t even inside, just some clothes.

Two months later, he broke no contact again after his uncle passed away. I’d donated to the GoFundMe his sister posted, and he reached out to thank me and ask how I was doing.

A month after that, I felt ready to get the rest of my stuff from him. I thought it would be our last meetup. I went to his house, and after talking for a bit, he invited me inside to hear a song he was working on. He said, “Don’t read into this,” then **played a song about missing a past relationship and wanting to understand her**. I was confused—he didn’t have to play that for me or invite me inside. Before I left, he said we should get coffee sometime, so I told him, “Sure, let me know.” But he never followed up.

Two months later, I was looking for an expensive camera I couldn’t find, so I reached out again. He said he had it, but he pushed back our meetup by a week. When I finally came by, he shared about a recent falling-out with his brother, then hugged me and said we should catch up over coffee. Again, I said, “Sure, let me know.” The next day, we texted a bit, but he left me on read.

Now, two weeks later, I can’t stop thinking: Why didn’t he give back all my stuff at once? Why didn’t he tell me he still had my things, or just mail them? Why play that song for me if it didn’t mean anything?

Every interaction we’ve had just leaves me with more questions and hope that never goes anywhere. I know I should block him, but I still care about him and it’s hard, especially since he’s had a rough year with his family.

**TL;DR**: Over the last 10 months since we broke up, both of us have broken no contact twice. Every interaction leaves me with more questions than answers. I know I should take responsibility for my own well being and block him so I can move on completely, but it’s tough because I still care about him.",3,1731628458.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

Six years ago, I was sleeping in my car between double shifts, showering at the gym, and eating nothing but ramen and whatever was on clearance.

The turning point wasn't some miracle or windfall. It was mind-numbingly boring stuff: I got a notebook and wrote down every single purchase, even the 50¢ gum. Seeing those numbers on paper hit different. I realized I was spending $40/month on ATM fees alone because I was always using the closest machine when broke.

Started walking 15 minutes to my actual bank. Started meal prepping even though I hate cooking. Got a $12 coffee maker instead of buying $5 gas station coffee every morning. None of this was fun or instagram-worthy, but watching my account slowly stop hitting zero every week kept me going.

The real game-changer was picking up cleaning gigs through an app. Just 2-3 houses every weekend. That extra $200-300 a month went straight to paying off my highest interest credit card. Took 18 months, but I killed that debt. Then the next one. Then the next.

Today I have $1000 in savings. That's probably nothing to most people, but to me it's everything. It means I can get my prescription filled without waiting for payday. It means I can buy toilet paper in bulk when it's on sale instead of paying more for single rolls.

I'm still not ""comfortable"" by any means. But I'm not in constant panic mode anymore, and that feeling is worth more than I can describe. If you're where I was - it's possible to climb out. Slowly. Boringly. But possible.

Edit: Holy crap, thank you all for the kind words and awards. Never expected this to blow up like this. To those asking - yes, it really did take 6 years. Progress wasn't linear. Had plenty of setbacks and months where everything went backwards. But kept pushing forward even when it felt hopeless.",50,1731628296.0,povertyfinance,9,0.8,False

1grix59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1grix59/love_story/,Love story ,"I love my partner too much we have been in a long distance relationship for a year and a month ago he came to see me when I saw him I didn’t feel butterflies or nerves but I felt at home and at peace. I felt like I already knew him. When my boyfriend cries I can’t help crying and when he is sick or when I remember moments of suffering from him I cry just as much. When he gave me my first kiss I will never forget it was at the skating rink it was my first kiss and it was wonderful after the first kiss I could not stop I wanted to kiss him more and more. When he kissed me I felt how wet I got. I wanted to hug him and never let go when he left it was hard but I knew I would see him again. My family said a lot of negative things but I didn’t let him and I defended him. With him I have told him my biggest secrets and there is nothing I can’t tell him. I write him poems and songs.

For the first time in my life I felt jealousy a day ago and it was a very strange thing for me. I with him did what I said I would not do and that was to have a moment in the movies me and him it was risky but it was wonderful. I cried and looked him in the eyes and hugged him. I told him to forgive me for having doubts whether I loved him or not and he hugged me and looking into my eyes he told me that nothing was wrong that he knew I loved him and I told him how do you know and he said I see it in your eyes. When he left it hurt too much and I cried a lot waiting for him to come back. I was sad that I could not be with him again on Saturday.

I remembered the moments when we went to eat tacos and he got his hands dirty and I cleaned them, when we ordered those pistachio and triple chocolate ice creams and he didn’t like the pistachio and I tried to take away the pistachio flavor and give him only chocolate. I remembered when I gave him food in his mouth, kissed him, hugged him and how my smile was big and intact. I am not a person who smiles a lot but with him it was impossible not to smile. I felt like taking his hand and never let go. I love to admire him when he is doing something I try to memorize every corner of his face as a work of art. I love when our eyes meet and we smile at each other and he tells me ? and laughs and I swim and laugh. I can’t help but think of him most of the time and always when I pass places I know he likes I say so. When he graduated I wish I could have been there even if I wasn’t there watching him grab his hard earned degree made me cry. Sometimes I have feelings in my heart that I don’t know how to explain.

This is my first relationship and it will be my only one. Sometimes I feel something warm in my heart that comes and goes. If I could make one wish it would be to be together forever and ever. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for him even if it was giving my life or taking a bullet for him. I know that many people say that a Capricorn is cold and unfeeling but I feel that when we fall in love we are totally devoted to this love we feel. I know his favorite food, I know his favorite snack, I know how he likes his coffee and the brand of coffee he likes. I will never forget Nestlé dolce coffee. I dream of a white house with flowers and peace. Me and him together living our life next to each other and the other with two children a beautiful and cute family. I don’t know anyone’s birthday but my siblings, my own and a cousin. However, I don’t forget his day. I had doubts at the beginning if what I felt was love or if I was in love with him in the end I think it was just my fears because he only needs to take my heart and give it to him. There is nothing I would not do for him and there is nothing I want in this life if it is not with him.",0,1731628203.0,Advice,2,0.5,False

1gritmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gritmg/manager_told_me_to_quit_for_having_integrity/,Manager told me to quit for having integrity?,"Today was the first day ever I've been mad this mad at a job. I work at a distrubing company signed up 4 months and it's been okay not great but okay they are known for being the worst and today really proved that.

Let's back track a little the other Saturday (Nov.2nd) I noticed that a coffe was about to expire and I wouldn't be at the store when It does so I told my management and people that go to the store.

The next Saturday I come to find it wasn't pulled even after one of my manager was there the day before. So I pull them off the shelve and look at the coffees that were sitting there from before I started I pulled 3 whole products well over 100 coffees that were months expired and 1 whole flavor of a certain brand.

On Tuesdays this week the (12th)my main manager was fired by the lady I did my hiring interview with today the (14th) they sent me to my first store all was well then changed my schedule to go to another one in town.

I get there start working and the lady who did my interview with arrives 2nd time seeing her. she's asks me about any concerns and I tell her that I'm concerned with the fact they are cutting hours heavy so I'm losing about 1/8 of my predicted annual pay and that with the time cut our quilitys gone down...

I got told I'm wrong about the hour cut effecting quality and that its the sales job (some dude who had 0 training) to check (it's not just thier job) and that primary role is too focus on quantity over quility and in doing so are hours are cut is because there's not enough work.

I tried to tell her there is more work we could be doing and said I've been slowing down to check everything which she clung too.

The reason why I'm being through is because I go to someone else store and always find expired stuff.

The rest of the conversation always went back to that ""me slowing down"" she was so angry that I said ""I slowed down"" she kept bring it up while I'm trying to get my point across and told me ""maybe I should just quit"" multiple times. I was getting frustrated that she wasnt listening to my legit concerns I mean people fucking bought those... told her that I was getting upset she was listening and it just made her more defensive, told me once again to just quit.

She then went on about how the new manager has systems (cause before I was told to just do it) and better way of doing things but when I asked about what they are I got told a story about how they did this shit 10 years ago... with no anwser.

Everytime I talked she got defensive spoke over me and I just went quiet.

If you mixed personable shit with work your an idiot.

Here's a list of concerns I didn't get to bring up...

- sales buys more products then needed or will be sold because they get a payout. then the store with the most the sales guy will buy a lot to not get yelled at but it's nothing close to the payout between the 3 stores he gets. The only person who pays is the grocery store which indirectly affects consumers Also I gotta listen to the receiver bitch.

- We send so much product to these stores we do have contract with knowing damn well it won't sell. For example if a coffee sells like 12 total a month you don't need to fill the shelve and order more every opportunity that one's missing let me rotate things and try to get it gone before it expires.

- we have the worst communication I ran a company before this shouldn't have left for a chick but whatever if I ever did half as shitty work as I've seen from my coworker I'd be fired in seconds  even the management's quility control and communication I'd lose my contract in an instant. 

- the only reason they're able to walk all over these stores is the few big valuable product contracts they do have and I hear it so much these receivers don't wanna accept the load but need just a few things out of the 6 boards sent so they always do. I mean our company benefits from not organizing pallets in the warehouse for that reason, otherwise I swear these stores would just pull off what they need send the rest back.

And yes I'm sure those extra concerns are more common with most distributing companies but it's all so avoidable.",1,1731627925.0,Advice,2,0.99,False

I made a mistake twice. It's a pretty harmless mistake: drinking coffee. My body hates it. After I drank a Mocha about 12 ounces, I had pretty terrible side effects. I wowed to never drink coffee again.

I am currently studying, and I gave coffee another shot to study better just 4 ounces, now I cannot sleep when I am supposed to. It messed up my anxiety, sleep, heart rate etc. It's a terrible drug but I did it again.

Now, am I unwise to make the same mistake twice? Should I blame myself for this?

- We have an Assistant Manager who nobody knows how he got the job or what he actually does since he acts like a barista when he's in and defers any and all decisions to the shift supervisors, but gets paid Assistant Manager money and goes on the manager outings. 
- We're bleeding staff, like our turnover is horrendous and by the time someone is trained, they want to leave. 
- Our store and drivethrough is constantly busy and rarely gets any quiet spells that last longer than fifteen minutes. I've seen how much money this store took in and it's ridiculous that we're constantly short staffed for the level of business. 
- We have a newly appointed supervisor who's had multiple sexual harassment complaints from three different members of staff in one month, two of them were from staff that were LITERALLY teenagers. All he received was a sit down meeting and promising he won't do it again. A new hire (18F) came to me last week to ask about his inappropriate behaviour. I advised her to speak to the GM...she got ignored and now her notice is in.
- I'm hard of hearing in one ear but regularly told I have to use the headsets. My dilemma is that I can only hear out of one ear so I can either take calls, or listen to customers/my team in store. I cannot do both, but I'm pulled up for this daily for removing my headset so I can hear customers as POS. Despite there being a sizable module on Inclusivity, this has been a daily argument that no managers are willing to budge on. 

I'm 36, already working a couple extra jobs and lucky enough to have other job offers sitting on the table. I don't have it in me to pretend I'm happy somewhere I'm not valued. I don't mind being a cog in a giant corporate machine, but at least give me a small sense of being valued or appreciated while I do it.

I (26) have recently started dating a lady (25) , we’ve known each other as friends for 5 years but only started dating 4 months ago after she split with her partner about 2 months prior.
I am a very open communicator and she is not so much, she has told me that she feels guilty for how things ended with her ex. The reason I say this is because I’ve just discovered that she has been texting him a lot and caught up with him for coffee earlier this week all after telling me she doesn’t talk to him anymore. I don’t know how to bring this up with her and I honestly don’t know what to think.

I don’t know what she could miss about him considering how toxic the relationship was, I know our relationship is much more healthy and the bedroom life is much greater than theirs ever was.

Fantasy series i loved: the Assassin's apprentice series (Robin Hobb, currently on book 6), Mistborn series (Brandon Sanderson) and youth novels like Wind on Fire Trilogy (William Nicholson) and Darren Shan's vampire books. I am not against romance in fantasy books, but i dislike anything poorly written, oversimplified (for me the Acotar books, Twillight etc are like that). Like if every second  paragraph is about a loosely dressed man/woman who is grunting, or seducing some human girl thats not for me thank you. Also i cant learn to love Terry Pratchett's style, i dont think i like funny or witty books unfortunately. Thank you very much for any suggestions. ",2,1731627279.0,suggestmeabook,12,1.0,False

**TL;DR**  Vermejo is a Ted Turner Reserve—a pristine and exclusive playground for outdoor enthusiasts in northern New Mexico.  Incredible fishing, hiking, mountain biking.  Guides are wonderful. Service is friendly and you will end up making friends with the whole staff.  Accommodations run from chubby to FAT- Bernal Lake Cabin being FAT and the rest more or less being chubby depending on your definition of luxury (it is personal.)   Big emphasis on conservation.

* 550,000+ acres
* 1,200+ wild bison
* 19 fishable lakes
* 30 miles of pristine streams
* Holistic spa services
* Traditional American cuisine
* Rates inclusive of all meals, non-alcoholic beverages, and two daily activities



**A little about me:**   I am a TA on u/sarahwlee’s team with u/alextravels.  My family loves luxury adventure off the beaten path and we prioritized this for our own personal travels this year.  Dropping some reviews from these trips in the upcoming weeks.   I traveled to Vermejo with my husband and 6 year old daughter. 



**Location** 

Vermejo is a 550,000-acre nature reserve and guest ranch in northeastern New Mexico  and southern Colorado.  Ted Turner Reserves, the luxury hospitality company founded by Ted Turner includes conservation research and ecosystem restoration along with guest operations.  It is nothing short of spectacular, with diverse terrain spanning from short-grass prairie to alpine tundra mountains at 13,000 feet.  It offers unparalleled opportunities to enjoy and interact with the natural world, and is one of the premier hunting, fishing and eco-tourism destinations in the West.  

Vermejo is home to abundant wildlife populations, including large herds of elk, deer, pronghorn antelope and bison, along with mountain lions, bears and Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep. The ranch is also home to a variety of birds, with over 180 species catalogued on property, including Merriam’s turkey, bald and golden eagles, and red-tailed hawks. Its streams and lakes provide plentiful angling opportunities for brown, rainbow and Rio Grande cutthroat trout.

 The best way I can describe this is like having an entire National Park  to yourself without the crowds.

**Getting there**

 Most people fly into Colorado Springs or Albuquerque/Santa Fe and then drive between 3-4 hours to get to the remote lodge. 

**Accommodations**

Vermejo offers numerous accommodation options for all group sizes and preferences. The *Casa Grande* mansion, originally Turner’s 25,000 square-foot private house, offers 7 rooms with early 19^(th)Century charm.  And just added recently — those wishing to follow in the owner’s footsteps can now reserve *Casa Grande’s Vermejo Suite*, where Turner himself stays while visiting. 

The 10-room *Turner House* has recently undergone a complete renovation, featuring suites (many with fireplaces), new bathrooms, coffee and beverage bars, sitting rooms and a large sun porch to enjoy the scenery. It also houses the Vermejo Spa. 

 For families or groups wanting their own home on the ranch there are five premium cottages, ranging from 3-5 bedrooms

 And to really get away from it all, the *Costilla Fishing Lodge* (solar-powered and LEED-certified) is 45 minutes away from the main lodge and offers closer access to prime fishing spots. It has its own dedicated chef and dining room, so no need to worry about long drives to the lodge for meals. 

Now for my absolute favorite :   Bernal Lake Cabin. 

 Bernal is a newly remodeled 2 master bedroom 3 bath cabin on it’s very own private lake.  

It comes with a private chef—and all meals included.   There is a loft with two twin beds for kids that is super cute and designed like a tent.   Downstairs there is a cozy living/dining room with a real fireplace, 2 master bedrooms with bathtubs and showers, a kitchen area with a small breakfast nook.   There is a huge deck overlooking the lake,  fishing gear, kayaks, a boat, an outdoor grill/kitchen/patio area, a firepit, and a cedar soaking hot tub.  It comes with your own utv and rental truck.   It is totally kitted out (wifi included) and the views are spectacular.   Having your own lake that no one else can use is pretty epic.     You have your own guide daily and activities that you plan ahead of time.  I was blown away—we got to spend the day here (we were staying in the main lodge) and we loved it so much we booked it for a week next July.

**Activities + Entertainment**

 For activities, consider Vermejo its own private back-to-nature old-school national park. The ranch’s incredible pre-arrival team works with each guest to create the perfect itinerary for everything you’d want to experience during your visit. There are 19 lakes and over 30 miles of streams for fishing, which you can explore on your own or arrange for a fishing guide. There are numerous hiking paths for all skill-levels, both guided and self-guided, and a “4 Peaks in Five Days” adventure for the truly dedicated. Horseback riding for beginners is available, or more advanced High-Country riding for a more advanced experience. A wide range of shooting sports include archery (with 3-D targets), shotguns (five-stand and wobble deck) and rifles. Mountain biking allows you to take advantage of stunning views and burn some calories while doing it. 

There are also programs that let you experience the heart of Vermejo’s conservation missions, such as the Guided Bison Expedition, Guided Wildlife Tour and Riverbank Restoration Tour. Your guide will explain how their programs have benefited the wildlife while you keep your eyes peeled to get that perfect photograph. You can even improve your shutter skills at one of Vermejo’s seasonal photography workshops.

 An outdoor enthusiast’s paradise, Vermejo offers a variety of outfitting opportunities including fully guided hunts for its turkey, antelope, mule deer and elk seasons. Vermejo also offers fishing guides during its fishing season and nature tourism guides for those who wish to explore the ranch. During the winter months guests enjoy guided winter activities such as ice fishing, snowshoeing, wildlife viewing and cross country skiing.  In addition to outdoor opportunities, Vermejo Park offers visitors a peaceful, undisturbed experience.

While on property we did a lot of fishing (regular and fly)  as well as fly fishing the streams in the STUNNING high country.  My daughter caught her first fish ever which was SO cool to watch.   Our goal was to learn to fly fish here—we had never tried it before and we came away totally obsessed.  My husband did shooting (wobble deck) and mountain biking,  and I went for a beautiful hike alone and read my book on the porch.   My daughter did horseback riding and the wildlife safari.  Together we did an incredible fancy picnic (my daughter said this was one of her favorite things we did), more hiking, disc golf, and the cowboy breakfast.

 **Dining**

Dining was a bit up and down.   Breakfast left a lot to be desired.   When you stay in the main lodge you dine in the main area.   It is different with Bernal Lake Cabin and Castilla Lodge where you have a private chef—which I imagine to be much better.  Lunch when eaten at the lodge was fantastic and SO good.   Lunch when packed for you was fine—nothing to write home about—a normal packed lunch.   Dinners were very very good overall but sometimes a little repetitive.  The picnic we had was incredible and much higher quality than the regular packed lunches.    

I did love that they always had snacks available and they had a whole giant fridge you could come and grab snacks or beverages whenever you wanted 24/7.   It was nice for my daughter to be a little more autonomous and she could go grab her own sparkling water etc.  The bar was well stocked and had a great selection of cocktails, wines—I was very impressed given the remote nature of the lodge.  

**Service**

The service here was very friendly and often quite impressive.   I felt really taken care of here—it’s very personal-  a mix of casual and high touch.   Everyone knew us by name.   The bartenders were both incredible.   Our guides were great.   Our daughter felt like nature royalty.  Housekeeping was hit or miss for us—I am a sucker for extra special care taken in housekeeping (FS or Rosewood style where they wrap your cords, put a bookmark in your book etc) and this was not our experience here.    Things were clean and that was it.  No frills.

Our daughter lost her favorite stuffed animal (she left it at Bernal Cabin it turns out—which is a good 30 min or so from the main lodge) and the whole staff went above and beyond to find it.   They even made a little story about it how “wolfy” had gotten up to mischief and was fishing at Bernal Lake.  She was thrilled.   

On the second to last day –we got a flat tire on our rental car.  Again, they went above and beyond and secured a tired from about an hour away, got it to the reserve, put it on our car and we had it by the time we left to drive back to Colorado Springs.

**Overall:**

We were very impressed with the magnitude of Vermejo-- there really isn’t anything like it that I have been to in the US.    It is the perfect place to unplug (or not) and spend time enjoying nature, healing, exercising, learning, laughing.  Would be a great family vacay, time with friends, teambuilding trip.   This is the perfect place to get away from the crowds in national parks and truly enjoy the surroundings around you. I can’t wait to go back --and my daughter said it was one of her very favorite vacations ever. ",8,1731627020.0,chubbytravel,3,1.0,False

It started kind of as the coalescing of a bunch of different individual friends, essentially all of whom started up being my friends before connecting with anyone else. Between 2021 and 2022, we got really close, and essentially the rest of my social life suffered as a result - I was just getting out of a five-year relationship and threw myself into this group of friends. We were **close** \- talking every day, telling each other everything, hanging out as much as possible. 

  
2023 saw much of this continue, marked by a huge, very traumatic event - one of us took their own life, despite we trying everything to make sure he wouldn't (even having 24/7 vigilance that his family kind of bailed on). This was very hard on us, and while it brought us together for a while, it also caused some issues internally. 

  
Things sort of got back on track in 2024. One of us studied in another country, and we even made a trip to visit him for his graduation ceremony. This guy was the one I felt closest to. I shared everything with him, felt a level of intimacy that I hadn't thought possible with a friend (or in general after my relationship crashed and burned). However, as soon as he got back to our home country, it all stopped. We still see each other when the whole group goes out to parties, but it became impossible for me to see him outside of group events. I invited him to coffees just for him to cancel last minute, I asked when we could hang out to evasives and non-responses, the whole shebang. This has happened to me before, and it was traumatic then and it is traumatic now; I do not understand why our friendship disappeared so suddenly and without warning. I even tried to talk it with him more than once and all he said is that I had a lot of barriers that don't let him know how I was feeling, which, although valid, I tried to work on a lot. 

  
My birthday came up in October and I organized a birthday party. I organized the invitee list, the place where it would happen, the day and hour, the theme, essentially all of it, without any of my friends' help. The day before the party, my ""best friend"" wrote to me to say they were preparing a big surprise and that I had beat them to the punch, so if I could please leave the WhatsApp group so they could plan. I was touched and did so, expecting them to prepare something exciting. Woe was me when the other day I found out there was literally nothing new to the party, and instead, I had to buy alcohol, chasers and pay for cabs because nobody was willing to put forth a single cent in the party. 

  
I tried to ignore it and let bygones be bygones, while realizing that they were simply not as considerate as I had initially thought them out to be. Still, I thought, we can be close friends. This week's events have had me seriously reconsidering that.

  
One of the members of the friend group was an actress in a theater play yesterday, and we all had agreed to go and support her. I thought we hadn't seen each other in almost exactly a month, so it was a pretty momentous occasion. It became even more momentous when two of the friend group members, who are dating, anounced they were engaged. Or, well, I thought they were announcing it - turns out it had happened Sunday and everyone else already knew, but for some reason nobody had told me. I was very happy, so I invited them to a round of drinks (to which I never even got a ""thank you"", but that's alright). After the play ended, we agreed to go to the actress' house, and once again, it somehow fell on me to order the Uber to take us all there. During the ride home, someone let it slip that they had had a huge blowout party on Halloween weekend where they all went together, most of them had costumes prepared, and I was not informed. This and finding out apparently a couple of them had removed me from their close friends made me very angry, and, as soon as we got off the van, I ordered another cab, left, and asked for all the money I had spent back.  Nobody reached out to me other than some very half-hearted apologies for not inviting me or telling me earlier about the engagement. 

  
I feel excluded, like an outsider in a friend group I helped create, and it hurts like hell. I don't even understand why any of this is going on. Was I overreacting to act like this? What might have caused this odd estrangement? I'm at an absolute lost and kind of devastated. ",3,1731626774.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

Nescafe- 8.5/10 Undeniable GOAT of Instant coffee,dominates the field for a reason.Prosandcons - Good quality of coffee,Taste is Good but not the best, Caffeine amount is good,Price is especially good for the Quality. Pro Tip- Buy the 2rs sachets in bulk.


Bru Gold- 8/10 Basically the underdog of Instant Coffee. Prosandcons -Quality as good as nescafe,Taste is even better than nescafe by a small margin, Caffeine amount is same as nescafe,Price is slightly higher due to unavailability of small sachets and also suffers from not having proper distribution. Pro tip- If you have it available in your region, buy in BULK, it usually runs out quickly.


Continental- 5/10 Terrible, sucks quality wise,Price is same as nescafe so overpriced for quality,taste is terrible feels like having burnt coffee,caffeine same as usual.


TATA Grande- 7.5/10 Good. Good quality,Price same as nescafe,caffeine same as usual,Taste slightly worse than nescafe.
If you do not like nescafe and bru gold isn't available then you could try it.


Davidoff- 8/10 Overrated. Prosandcons- Incredible quality,Probably one of the best taste instant coffee can offer,Caffeine is higher than usual,Price is High BUT better brands available at similar price with even better stats.


TLG- 7.5/10 Simply good. Prosandcons- Simply the best. Everything same as Davidoff for a cheaper price.Quality slightly worse.It is basically a davidoff ripoff thats not that bad.


Flavoured Coffee-In general, disgusting and not worth it but if u do like it,then


Rage- 6/10 Prosandcons- Taste is decent,Price is budget friendly,Caffeine amount is lower than usual,if u want coffee to stay awake DO NOT go for flavoured coffee, Quality is way worse than even most flavoured coffee brands+has a mix of chicory and coffee and not pure coffee.


Sleepy Owl- 7.5/10 Prosandcons- Probably the best flavoured instant coffee brand. Caffeine amount is lower than usual which is common for flavoured coffee,quality is the best in flavoured coffee,Taste is also best especially french vanilla,Price is same as other flavoured coffee brands so budget friendly.


Bevzilla- ??? Havent Tried yet,but seeing reviews and word of mouth, same as typical flavoured coffee, no reason to prefer it over any other brand.


Gold standards or any other higher quality onez of all brands are obviously better than classic ones. Any cheaper ones of coffee from same brand like Nescafe sunrise or Tata grand blue pack are coffee and chicory mix and not pure coffee.


In general,best brand for coffee is Nescafe classic(best quality for price),second is Bru gold which is better than Nescafe except distribution problems.
Best premium coffee is Either Nescafe Gold or Davidoff.
Premium coffee for cheaper-TLG
Best flavoured coffee- Sleepy Owl
Best decaf coffee- Nescafe Classic Decaf
Best Coffee flavour-probably French Vanilla",2,1731626762.0,IndianTeenagers,0,1.0,False
1griek9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1griek9/aitah_for_making_smart_remarks_to_my_husband_who/,AITAH for making smart remarks to my husband who used me as an excuse. ,"My husband (60M) came home early yesterday and told me (47F) that he used me as an excuse to leave work early. He told his manager and foreman that I had taken a bad fall putting up Christmas decorations. That is not all of it. When he called them this morning he continued his story telling them he had come home to me on the floor with plants and soil thrown everywhere from my fall, that I had hit the coffee table on my way down and that my knee and my ankle are swollen and he was going to be taking me in for x-rays. Here is the thing we work for the same company, I work from home on a couple of different project than him, but we know a lot of the same people from previous jobs.

He is telling me the story that way if anyone comes up to me at our upcoming Christmas party I can be prepared if they ask me how I'm feeling. I told him I thought this was seriously f\*\^%ked up. I told him I didn't like being used as an excuse so he can get off work early and I have been making smarty pants comments towards him. For example when he asked me if I was okay, I told him ""I'm not sure you tell me"" or he askes me to get him something and I tell him ""no, my knee is hurting I can't walk right now"" He told me he is getting sick of my smart a\*\* comments and that he is over it. I told him I don't appreciate being used as an excuse and I don't appreciate someone ""wishing harm upon me"" he told me I was overreacting.

So AITAH for not wanting to be used as excuse....FYI this isn't the first time he has done this to me the last time he didn't tell me I was his excuse so when I was asked by an acquaintance if I was feeling better I told them I was never ill. They gave me the weirdest look and when I mentioned it to my husband that night he told me why they were asking me that, he was upset that time too telling me I should've known to just go with it.",1,1731626744.0,AmItheAsshole,14,1.0,False

1grid5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1grid5d/drink_hacks_for_2024_drink_packages_vs_no_drink/,Drink Hacks for 2024 --Drink Packages vs No Drink Package,"Just wanted to post some hacks as I've successfully done a cruise w/ a drink package and without a drink package. Both cruises were 7 day cruises. One was in the Carribean, and one was in Alaska.

**Drink Package Experience.** I am a heavy drinker when I'm on a cruise. When I get off the ship aside from doing excursions, I plan to drink. Drinking means 4-5 drinks minimal while at port. When I got back on board from a heavy drinking day, the MOST I could consume in addition to what I had in port was maybe about 4-5 drinks on average. There was one instance where I couldn't drink a single damn drop: Cozumel port I spent a beach day at Mr. Sanchos and had ZERO drinks back on board as I was completely loaded.

With all that said, I got my money's worth with the drink package as I averaged about 8-9 drinks a day. This by the way is marginally better, not a lot better. A few days I was able to max it. A few days I had very little due to heavy drinking at ports. This wasn't *super easy* as there were times where I didn't really need a drink but because I could, what the hell, let's have 2 bloody marys at breakfast instead of 1!

**No Drink Package Experience Hacks:**

* With Royal, you can pre-purchase liquor for your stateroom. I'm not sure if there really is a limit, but it's something like $36-40 for a 375ML w/ 6 cans of mixers. This sounds expensive, but it's *really not* and actually works out to a pretty reasonable cost per ounce. I puchased two and consumed them by Day 6 of a 8 day cruise. Carnival has removed this hack, so this is not available on carnival.
* If you are traveling with a group, you are each allowed to bring wine onboard on most cruises. If anyone in your party doesn't like wine, or is getting the drink package, or cannot/doesn't drink, have them STILL bring on a bottle. Grab their bottles. We accumlated 4-5 bottles of wine in our stateroom and knocked them out in tumblers over the first few days along with our spirts in our room.
* Embarkation sometimes will have drink deals on the top deck. Carnival has ""bucket of beer"" deals for half off. Definitely go buy those (and get your spouse or friend buy them as well) and store them in your state room.
* Carnival used to have a good price on growler refills on ships that have a brewery. I've last seen it at $20 per a growler fill. This is an exceptional price. Not sure if it's still going on.
* If traveling in a group of drinkers and non-drinkers, there is the ol' switch-a-roo hack that you can do, but is probably frowned on since you're staying in a room that you're actually not technically assigned to. Never have done this before, but google it.
* There is some casino hacks that you can do, but there is a minimum buy-in and stuff that's needed before you get drinks served. To my understanding, you can just sit down and start playing and get served free drinks. I've never experienced that before, but I'm also not a gambler.
* Consider not arriving for debarkation sober. Obviously please be responsible and know your limits (as with any of these hacks) but you should consider to get a few in prior of the cruise. What are you going to do anyways, wait in a hotel until your check in? Head down to any cheap local bar/brunch and enjoy yourself. This shouldn't need to be said, but thought I'd list it.

Using these hacks, I spent $350 on drinks between my wife and I on our last 8 day cruise. This was much cheaper than $800. I always had a beer/alcohol in my hand. I was never without a drink when I wanted one. This also includes purchasing alcohol several times on multiple days from onboard.

Rarely ever is buying the drink pass a good deal for most people. I know lots of people like to THINK this. The biggest issue is simply because the whole stateroom (over 21) has to purchase the pass. I rarely ""shack"" with people that drink hard. I shack with my wife, who drinks little. So now instead of having to hit 6-7 drinks to break even, I have to actually drink more than that collectively to make hers break even.

**Drink Package Conclusion Points.**

1. Drink Package can be worth it, but typically the following needs to be met: (1) The ship has more than 1 or 2 sea days, (2) both people in a state room need to be heavy drinkers if one person is funding the trip. The famous ""6-7"" calculation is for one person to break even, but consider that the second person also needs to be breaking even, especially if traveling with someone that doesn't drink--you will go up against some unwinnable odds.
2. The drink package is heavily slanted in the ship's (aka, the ""House"") favor. Why would they create a package that wouldn't allow them to have increased revenue?
3. Beers are still relatively cheap on cruises. If you are a beer drinker, or will be consuming beer a significant amount of time, then the golden ""6-7"" rule increases to break even.
4. Someone will undoubely bring up soda and coffee being included. Unless you are someone that drinks specialty coffee multiple times a day, you really shouldn't let this weigh heavily on your decision. And Soda? Most cruise lines allow you to bring a limited (but good) amount on board, so disregard the soda. There's always someone that's 60 or above that will bring up ""Free milkshakes"", but I personally do not go on cruises to drink milkshakes.

I felt like I already knew him. When my boyfriend cries I can’t help crying and when he is sick or when I remember moments of suffering from him I cry just as much. When he gave me my first kiss I will never forget it was at the skating rink it was my first kiss and it was wonderful after the first kiss I could not stop I wanted to kiss him more and more. When he kissed me I felt how wet I got. I wanted to hug him and never let go when he left it was hard but I knew I would see him again. My family said a lot of negative things but I didn’t let him and I defended him. With him I have told him my biggest secrets and there is nothing I can’t tell him. I write him poems and songs.

For the first time in my life I felt jealousy a day ago and it was a very strange thing for me. I with him did what I said I would not do and that was to have a moment in the movies me and him it was risky but it was wonderful. I cried and looked him in the eyes and hugged him. I told him to forgive me for having doubts whether I loved him or not and he hugged me and looking into my eyes he told me that nothing was wrong that he knew I loved him and I told him how do you know and he said I see it in your eyes. When he left it hurt too much and I cried a lot waiting for him to come back. I was sad that I could not be with him again on Saturday.

I remembered the moments when we went to eat tacos and he got his hands dirty and I cleaned them, when we ordered those pistachio and triple chocolate ice creams and he didn’t like the pistachio and I tried to take away the pistachio flavor and give him only chocolate. I remembered when I gave him food in his mouth, kissed him, hugged him and how my smile was big and intact. I am not a person who smiles a lot but with him it was impossible not to smile. I felt like taking his hand and never let go. I love to admire him when he is doing something I try to memorize every corner of his face as a work of art. I love when our eyes meet and we smile at each other and he tells me ? and laughs and I swim and laugh. I can’t help but think of him most of the time and always when I pass places I know he likes I say so. When he graduated I wish I could have been there even if I wasn’t there watching him grab his hard earned degree made me cry. Sometimes I have feelings in my heart that I don’t know how to explain.

This is my first relationship and it will be my only one. Sometimes I feel something warm in my heart that comes and goes. If I could make one wish it would be to be together forever and ever. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for him even if it was giving my life or taking a bullet for him. I know that many people say that a Capricorn is cold and unfeeling but I feel that when we fall in love we are totally devoted to this love we feel. I know his favorite food, I know his favorite snack, I know how he likes his coffee and the brand of coffee he likes. I will never forget Nestlé dolce coffee. I dream of a white house with flowers and peace. Me and him together living our life next to each other and the other with two children a beautiful and cute family. I don’t know anyone’s birthday but my siblings, my own and a cousin. However, I don’t forget his day. I had doubts at the beginning if what I felt was love or if I was in love with him in the end I think it was just my fears because he only needs to take my heart and give it to him. There is nothing I would not do for him and there is nothing I want in this life if it is not with him.",0,1731626557.0,AskMenOver30,0,0.25,False

* When customers were overwhelmed with too many choices, only 3% made a purchase. However, by reducing the number of options and simplifying the decision process, that number jump to 40%.

This is one of the reasons why general stores are challenging. It's also the reason why Starbucks' new CEO decided recently to simplify its menu.

So keep your catalogue simple.

* When Campbell soup restricted how many cans a person could buy, demand surged.

The limitation created a sense of exclusivity and added value driving people to purchase more.

Do you place a cap on the number of units customers can buy from your store?

* When two hotel rooms were priced a similar rate, but one included a free morning coffee. People chose the room with the coffee without even considering the quality of the rooms.

Neural scientists found that people often struggle to assess the true value of something and instead compare to what's available around them.

Therefore, if you offer a freebie, customers will be more forgiving when the quality is bad.

Comparison of Ergonomic Features in Budget-Friendly Office Chairs
-----------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to choosing a budget-friendly office chair, many people often feel overwhelmed by the vast array of options available. However, understanding the ergonomic features can help you make a more informed decision. A chair that supports your body properly can prevent discomfort and boost productivity. In this guide, we will explore the key ergonomic features to consider when selecting a cost-effective office chair.

Check Details Here: https://homeandgardendreams.com/amazon-basics-classic-puresoft-pu-padded-mid-back-height-adjustable-office-computer-desk-chair-with-armrest  
  
### Adjustability

One of the most crucial ergonomic features in any office chair is adjustability. Here are the main aspects to look for:

- **Seat Height:** The ability to adjust the seat height allows you to position your feet flat on the ground, which can help keep your legs at a 90-degree angle.
- **Armrest Height:** Adjustable armrests can prevent shoulder and wrist strain, a common issue when typing for long periods.
- **Backrest Position:** A chair that lets you adjust the backrest angle supports your spine's natural curve, providing comfort during long workdays.

### Lumbar Support

Many affordable office chairs come with lumbar support features that help maintain the natural curve of your lower back. Lumbar support is vital for reducing fatigue and discomfort. Here are some points to consider:

Check Details Here: https://homeandgardendreams.com/amazon-basics-classic-puresoft-pu-padded-mid-back-height-adjustable-office-computer-desk-chair-with-armrest  
  
- **Built-in Lumbar Support:** Some chairs have a built-in lower back support that can adjust in height and depth, providing personalized comfort.
- **Removable Cushions:** Certain models offer removable lumbar cushions, allowing you to customize your seating experience based on your body type.

### Seat Material

The choice of material for the seat can greatly affect comfort. Here are a few economical materials that are commonly used:

- **Mesh:** Mesh seats provide excellent breathability, keeping you cool during extended periods of sitting.
- **PU Foam:** High-density PU foam cushions are budget-friendly options that offer decent comfort and durability.
- **Fabric:** Soft fabric seats offer warmth and comfort but may require more maintenance to keep them looking clean.

### Mobility

Ease of movement is another essential factor when selecting an office chair. An ideal budget-friendly chair should have:

- **Swivel Function:** A chair that can rotate allows you to reach different areas of your desk without straining your back.
- **Caster Wheels:** Smooth-rolling wheels can be beneficial on various flooring surfaces. Ensure the wheels are suitable for your floor type, whether it be hardwood, carpet, or tile.

### Stability and Frame Quality

The stability of your chair is crucial to ensure safety and comfort. Look for these features:

- **Base Structure:** A five-point base is standard for office chairs and offers better stability compared to four-point designs.
- **Weight Capacity:** Make sure the chair can support your weight comfortably. Many budget chairs come with high weight limits.

### Warranty and Brand Reputation

When investing in any chair, even a budget model, it’s wise to consider the warranty and the brand’s reputation. A warranty can provide peace of mind in case of defects:

Check Details Here: https://homeandgardendreams.com/amazon-basics-classic-puresoft-pu-padded-mid-back-height-adjustable-office-computer-desk-chair-with-armrest  
  
- **Warranty Duration:** Longer warranties can signify quality and durability, making your investment safer.
- **Customer Reviews:** Read customer feedback on various platforms to understand how the chair performs over time.

Choosing the right office chair doesn’t always require a hefty investment. By focusing on the ergonomic features discussed above, you can find a budget-friendly chair that not only enhances your work experience but also promotes better posture and comfort. Remember to consider your personal needs and preferences while shopping around to ensure you make the best choice for your workspace.

### Conclusion

Its soft padding and adjustable height allow for a comfortable seating posture that can cater to different desk setups, significantly reducing the risk of strain during long work hours. The armrests add an extra layer of support, promoting a more relaxed upper body position.

When comparing this chair to other budget-friendly options, it stands out due to its balance of ergonomic features and affordability. Many chairs within the same price range lack sufficient padding or proper height adjustments, which can lead to discomfort over time. The Amazon Basics chair directly addresses these common issues, making it a valuable investment for those on a budget who do not want to skimp on quality.

[25M],"25M, 6'1 200 lbs, been seeing people say in North America we get way too little Vitamin D and need to supplement them. My daily consumption typically is 3 eggs, pork sausage, a lot of water (but no other liquids, no milk, coffee, alcohol, sports drinks, soda, etc, I like having liquid IV or Nuun or other hydration stuff when I can but it's too expensive), wheat or white bread, apples, rice, chicken, maybe some beans, spinach, tomatoes, and/or onions. I don't often eat fish as it's too annpying to prepare and no good takeout for it around where I live. As a result I don't enjoy it either when I do have fish, so almost never eat it. I eat beef and/or lamb here and there too.

Been looking into supplementing with vitamins or pills or something but don't want to take vitamins I don't need/miss vitamins I do need. Very strongly planning to supplement Vitamin D as I know I'm not getting enough, but just don't know how heavily I need to supplement and what other vitamins I need too. I don't take creatine ever but consume whey protein powder in a shake most days which I'd though may have some Vitamin D as whey is a component of milk, but maybe not.",1,1731626033.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I’m currently working as an engineering technician. I accidentally fell into this job and I really can’t complain too much. I spend most of the week working from home, drinking tea/coffee and lurking in the background of Zoom meetings while trying to figure out how to do something a little bit more exciting for work. I feel like I need to be doing something more creative with my time on this planet.

It’s not unusual to find me deep inside a Spotify hole with my headphones on, hunting for new music and creating playlists. If you have any music suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

I love to draw/sketch/doodle and I’ll ALWAYS be up for drawing something for the people I chat with. I thrive when someone gives me an idea and its also a great way to see what goes on in someone’s head 😊

In what very little spare time that I have, I like to go to the gym. I seen someone post recently that they were looking for someone to effectively be their gym friend. I quite like this idea and would happily do that with someone too. Routine advice, encouragement and just someone to keep each other company in-between sets.

had 4 surgical extractions monday morning. got some liquids down me the first two days, a bit of mash the day after. pain was no more than a 4 when swallowing - otherwise there's just some general weird vibes - like the fact there's holes and stitches all up in my mouth.

  
I'm on day 5 and that's it. no pain, a little swelling still left over but going down. but it's not even fully discomfort - it's just an *awareness* of the wounds, if that makes sense. 

  
I had some boiled carrots two days ago and yesterday i made pancakes and pasta so i have been chewing. but i just have no idea how to judge where i am on the healing timeline. There's stitches everywhere and no pain. my jaw feels a little sensitive but i have good mobility, i just don't open super wide (think, yawning) because i don't want to disturb the stitches. chewing isn't painful, i just get paranoid when food moves towards the back of my mouth. I pretty much only have had pain when swallowing or eating but even then it's not consistent and never more than a 3-4. At this point, I just have mild discomfort from the sockets pulling when i swallow (so like a 2).

It's really hard to work out what i can do here. can i go to the gym and do some low impact cardio like cycling? can i drink a coffee? should i try some very soft/pulled meat/fish? helpppp",2,1731625830.0,wisdomteeth,3,1.0,False

Ikaw ang eventual class valedictorian, ako ay ang notorious na loner, bass guitarist ng banda. Nasa iyo na ang lahat, ganda, talino, kabaitan. Dahil sa mapaglarong tadhana, napalapit tayo sa isa't isa dahil sa hilig natin sa pagsusulat, mga kanta ng Beatles, movie preferences (Reality Bites) at mga useless knowledge at pop culture. I remember you and I writing letters every week to each other and slipping it near the altar sa classroom natin kasi ayaw natin malaman ng iba ang closeness natin. Once a while, we will meet sa may beach malapit sa bahay nyo to chat for hours.

Then noong fourth year na tayo, we still continued our special friendship. You would confide to me about your suitors, incoming college years, our dream to became lawyers, etc. During our prom, ginulat natin ang lahat ng tayo ang first and last dances ng isa't isa. College years natin, we continued to write to each other, nag - Ateneo ka, while ako chooses to stay sa province natin para dito na mag-aral. Noong nauso na ang cellphone, we became constant textmates. Slowly, we drifted, nagka BF ka na, while ako naman was enjoying my life as a student activist.

Nagulat ako noong nabalitaan ko na you did not pursue law and instead started to work in a multi-national company. While I worked as an LGU staff sa atin. During our high school reunion, we connected. Napalimit din pag - uwi mo sa atin and we have coffee often. I started to go to law school eventually every saturday and sunday sa Manila. We will meet once and a while with your boyfriend then.

All of sudden, you decided to go to Hong Kong to teach there.  As I was busy with law school and work and you navigating your career overseas, we once again lost contact. Eventually, nagka-asawa ka ng Amerikano na fellow faculty mo. Ako naman went on to pass the bar,  got married, became a father.

Malas naman natin, parehong naging failure marriage natin. I bumped into your mom when I went back to our province to start over with my daughter. She said to me na pareho daw ang karanasan natin sa pag-aasawa. She said that you will be returning home for good na and a revelation was dropped to me by your mom: ""Kaw kasi, hindi mo niligawan, hinihintay ka niya kaso ang bagal mo daw.""

H\_ \_ a, we kissed, noon sa may beach. You knew then na you will always be the only one. Kaso that kiss led us not talk for a few weeks and we dismissed it eventually.

This is a long one apparently, I'm sorry!

I (32F) have been with my Fiancé (31M) for the past 8 years, While we are at a good place now we haven't always been and a decent portion of that has been due to my FiL... We met in primary school and connected relatively quickly as we both had pretty shitty parents and could relate to the other a lot, then one day he just up and disappeared..

10 Years later when we reconnected (thanks social media} I found out he had been shipped off to another state with no warning as his parents had been deemed negligent and would regularly abandon him and his sister to go partying for weeks at a time, to live with his grandparents. (this was all before we were old enough to have our own phones ect so keeping in contact was difficult) 

when we began our relationship, I had two boys from previous relationships and he had 4 kids as well I assumed we were at similar stages in maturity since we both had kids and jobs ect.... oof was I wrong!

There was a lot of nights out , coming home really drunk and waking up my boys, some nights there was zero contact when he had asked me to stay awake to come pick him up. All this would occur at his Dad's place.

After about a year of this ( i thought he would get it out of his system in a few months) I ended up sitting him down and telling him, ""this is not the life I want for me and my boys. I do not want my boys growing up thinking this is normal behaviour for men so if you want to continue on this path that is your choice but we wont be apart of it""

It was a difficult conversation that spanned a couple of days, In the beginning he tried to justify all this as ""normal Behaviour"" because its what his parents did when he was a kid, after that comment I kind of snapped and reminded him of all the times he came to school without food because FiL had run off and left them no food or money for food and I would share the small amount I had to ensure he wouldn't go hungry, of all the times I had snuck him and his sister into my house after my parents had passed out drunk cause there was no power at their house and they needed to be warm. I really lost my cool at one point when he was trying to dismiss what his parents had done as ""young and stupid"" and said  ""I've spent years cleaning up after you dad's poor decision, I wont do it any longer""

I'm not sure how that landed or what he thought because he had left after that and gone to his dad's house. 24 hrs later he shows up on my doors step (I always peek through the curtains before I open the door ) so when I opened the door I expected to be hit with the stench of a brewery, I was nearly floored when I couldn't smell any alcohol at all. he asked if he could come in and talk, I said yes but id prefer he was gone before the boys got home as to not confuse them even further  

 He burst into tears on my doorstep... I ushered him into the dining area and made him a coffee while he tried to compose himself. He told me he had gone to his dad's cause he wanted some answers about his childhood, after what I'd reminded him happened he felt the rose colours glasses break and needed to know why and what happened. 

His father still in the same mindset of when we were children shrugged it all off and attempted to get him to drink with him again.. after almost a day of trying to talk to his father he realised his father hadn't changed, didn't have any ideals on how family should be and was very self centred around what he wanted still. This broke my partner, he realised this is similar to what he had done to us, only difference was the kids had me holding everything together (His mother is a whole different story for a different time) He had decided to go no contact with his Dad and try and ""sort his shit out"" so he could be a better parent and partner. 

I wasn't sold on the idea that he would be capable of turning it around as fast as he thought he could, I said he could stay until he found his own place and if he could show me progress we could talk about us. 

after a month I personally did a dumb, the kids were away at their co parents places and i decided to have a couple of drinks.... and by a couple I mean... a lot. We ended up having sex (it was fully my decision I instigated it, he repeatedly checked in to make sure its what I wanted) six weeks later I found out I was pregnant. we got back together after our daughter was born, he had spent my pregnancy doing all the courses, reading all the books ect to make sure he was ready this time. 

  
Things have been great lately, when our daughter turned two she was diagnosed with Autism ( not a surprise there one of my boys is ASD as well) so we had to discuss what we would do as she was high needs and required specialised care, Having been through this before with my son I figured it would end up being me who became the SAHP but to my shock my partner said he would like to do it.. I asked him if he understood what would be required of him and how draining it can be ect and his response ""well you have a bit of time off coming up you can teach me, you also earn twice as much as I do so it makes more sense for you to keep your job"" This man really surprised me that day, he had always seemed like a ""guys guy"", needed to be the bread winner type person but he proved me wrong! 

  
Fast forward to this year, our daughter is now 5 and he has been primary carer for her this past 3 years, the government gives him a payment to help subsides the loss of wages since he cant work. His father decided to reach out to him and try to make contact again(not a clue why) My partner decided to test the waters and see if he'd changed at all. FiL has made some minor improvements but when it comes to family responsibilities he's still the same. he will randomly show up at our house and try to convince him to ""go for a drive"" (code for go drinking) in the middle of the day, my partner would turn him down for one valid reason or another ( 5yo has an appointment , Kids need picking up from school, things like that ) and FiL would scoff or call him ""pussy whipped"" for allowing me to con him into being the stay at home parent \*eyeroll\* 

  
2 months ago I left my job for mental health reasons and have been attempting to find a new one, I'm assuming he told FiL this as the random unannounced drop ins have ramped up dramatically, with the reasons of ""well now shes home you can come with me"" sort of reasoning. Partner spoke with me about this and I said i had no problem with him hanging out with his dad but day drinking was a no and if we had things of for the Kids that over lapped I would need his help ( my two boys go to different schools and pick up is at the same time so we need both of us to do pick up, I used to work down the road from my eldest's school so he would just walk to work and hang out till I was finished but now I need to pick him up cause its a 30 minute drive from our house) FiL has taken this as a green light for everything and anything! he will show up at 830 in the morning and pick up Partner and then drop him at the school 10 minutes after pick up or I'll have a job interview that i have to reschedule (and end up missing out on the job) because I've got 5yo and Partner isn't home in time for me to go 

I raised this issue with Partner and he said he was getting mad about it too and would speak to FiL about it.... that resulted in FiL scoffing at him wanting to be home more for the kids and myself. Partner got mad, Called him a wanker and stormed off. 2 Days later FiL shows up and wants to take him for a drive again, partner says ""I need to be home by X o'clock as I've got shit to do"" FiL promises he will be home in time.... annnndddd he wasn't.   
My partner is struggling as he doesn't want to cut his dad out again but he also knows he can't enforce the boundaries needed for a healthy relationship, it's something he has mentioned a few times to me. 

  
So, WIBTA if I spoke with FiL and told him to pull his head in or leave us alone? ",10,1731625647.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,7,1.0,False

He will text me every day, at least once, and we check up on eachother whenever both of us have time (he is finishing his studies and I work up to 11 hours some days...). Thing is, I feel like my needs are not being met and I think I'm not getting what I want when it comes to a relationship. 
He is intelligent, hard working, very studious, cute, and a bit dorky. I quite like him, to be honest... but I cannot let the fact that he hardly makes an effort to know me personally and spend time with me slip. Mind you, I try my best to get him to share his day, thoughts and interests with me, but I feel like I'm not getting the same energy back... He quite literally cancelled our plans because his friends asked him to hang out, and seems like being with me for 2 hours is more than enough for him. He will not hesitate to just leave the moment we've had a coffee or I've been at his place for about 2 hours when he is supposed to be ""free"" that same afternoon. Because of work, I have limited time to do my own stuff, meet friends, and be with my family, but still I always try and tell him a day we could meet because I want to nurture this connection... and any time I let him know when I have time, he just answers with ""we'll see throughout the week"", ""we can talk about it"".

I feel like I should just tell him I am looking for someone who is willing to put in the effort and a bit of their time when it comes to building something of a romantic connection, as he told me he wants to ""get into a serious relationship"". I am unsure if this is all happening basically because he does not like me enough, or because I am someone he does not see a future with, or because he really is not ready for a relationship... but I feel like I am kinda ""losing my time"" if he does not want a serious relationship with me, as I want to be able to treat him like I actually want to treat him: like a romantic partner. I want to be able to be sweet and caring and loving with him, but I feel like, if he doesn't like me enough, all of that will just scare him away and I will (again) just loose my time and energy on someone who was not in it for the long run...

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

When I say honest, I’m the one who is blunt about what she has done to our family and she is in absolute denial, deflecting and blaming everyone else. The other day we were talking about how her and my dad were soon to retire. To that I said how it’s important that they both have some of their own hobbies and friends. I also say how I think she’s kinda beaten my dad’s spirit down. I know it’s harsh but I have had enough and have been poking her for a few years now. She goes in complete defense and denial telling me about what he has done. I tell her I don’t care, we are talking about you now. I say how I remember being a teenager and how my dad got a new work friend - a middle aged man and she was so jealous that she accused my dad of being gay. She was going insane - huge arguments, violence, spitting and yelling profanities. She goes on to say it was weird and a lot of bs you all can imagine - absolutely not her fault. She says how dad could have invited her for a coffee with this new friend to ease her mind. She goes to after work things with her female colleagues. I ask her if dad has ever been invited - no he hasn’t. All this to say, my dad didn’t continue the friendship. I remember being a kid and feeling so bad for him. My heart would hurt. I once told him while he was driving me to town, that I hope he knows that I would still love him just as much if not more if he was gay and that he would never lose my brother and me. 

I am 36 and these memories and feelings are just coming back full force. In my 20s I noticed some traits I had that were very similar to my mothers - I went full force to eliminate it. I am so afraid of being like her that I have been in therapy for over a decade.

Shout-out to **Jing** for getting overcaffeinated (liquid anxiety tastes too good), to **Jan Michael Garcia** for questioning CEB's buyback before doing any dividend payments to CEBCP holders, to **@k119850225** for noting that CEB's buyback is actually the resumption of an old plan, to **Krystle A** for demanding more transparency, to **VincentBongGogh** for using gallows humor to mentally cope with the PSEi's correction, to **Shanley Matthew Lumagod** for looking at VREIT as a stagnant stock with good divs (that's largely true!), and to **arkitrader** for a great visualization of the classic buybacks vs. dividends debate.

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]  Figaro briefly suspended for failure to submit annual report...** **Figaro** [FCG 0.76 unch; 33% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=a1659157add224efabca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] was suspended by the PSE to start the trading day for failure to submit its Annual Report before the applicable deadline. The suspension was indefinite, meaning that it would last until FCG submitted the required report. Luckily for FCG shareholders, the **Liu Family’s** coffee/pizza company submitted its report at noon and the suspension was lifted later that day at 1:00 PM. FCG reported a 36% increase in net income to ₱628 million, with systemwide sales up 27% to ₱5.45 billion. FCG attributed the increase in revenues to the net increase of 39 stores, pushing its total store count to 206. ""**Angels Pizza[sic]**"" accounted for 90% of the new store openings.
>    - ***MB:*** FCG added 39 new stores on a net basis, but it actually opened 57 stores this year. This implies that FCG closed 18 stores, but it doesn’t give any explanation that I could see for that high-level of churn. That’s almost 11% of their FY23 store count that closed. Even high-performing juggernauts like **Jollibee** [JFC 258.00 ▲1.2%; 237% avgVol] close stores for a wide variety of reasons (footprint optimization, responding to market changes, lease/property issues), but JFC only closed 225 stores in FY23 (3.6% of its total stores) while opening 658 new stores (10.6% of its total stores). FCG closed 18 stores (10.8% of its total stores) while opening 57 (34.1% of its total stores). Their closure rate is almost triple that of JFC. Sure, their growth rate is triple that of JFC, but it doesn’t automatically follow that large growth means large store death. Perhaps same-store sales data would help, but unfortunately, FCG doesn’t supply this data (or if they do, I couldn’t find it). JFC doesn’t F around with the data or make shareholders scrounge through the data scraps to craft their own insights from the gnarly ingredients they find. If I were a shareholder (I’m not), I’d applaud FCG’s growth but I’d want to get a better picture of how the management team is handling existing stores to see if there are any operational issues that are being hidden by this high level of annual growth. The company is taking on a lot of debt to finance the expansion and it doesn’t look like rate relief is coming as quickly as some may have hoped. Would it be healthy if FCG matched their FY23 rate and closed 22 stores this year?

>- **[DIVS]  AREIT declares 17th consecutive non-shrinking dividend...** **AREIT** [AREIT 38.30 ▼1.5%; 125% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=154c4bd8948282d8abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] declared a Q3/24 dividend of ₱0.58/share, payable on January 13 to shareholders of record as of December 12. The dividend has an annualized yield of 6.06% based on the previous closing price (5.85% previously). The total amount of the dividend is ₱1,862 million, which is 90% of the ₱2,069 million in distributable income that AREIT reported for the quarter and it brings AREIT’s cumulative 9M distribution rate up to exactly 90.0%. Relative to AREIT's IPO price, the dividend increased AREIT's total stock and dividend return to 74.89%, up from its pre-dividend total return of 72.74%.
>    - ***MB:*** AREIT is up almost 15% YTD and almost 18% over the past 12 months. It’s declared 17 consecutive quarters of growing or stable dividends, injected billions worth of new assets, diversified its portfolio, and has worked to improve its communication with shareholders across all of these developments. And yet, somehow, it’s locked in a battle with the **Villar Family’s** runty industrial REIT, **Premiere Island Power REIT** [PREIT 2.14 ▼1.8%; 21% avgVol], for “safest income stream on the PSE” as measured by yield. AREIT, the PSE’s first REIT and gold standard for the sector has an estimated yield of 5.85% at its current price, while PREIT, a small company that rents land to a diesel genset operator that has never adjusted its portfolio and that has actually seen its dividend crumble in recent quarters, has an estimated yield of 6.09% (the second lowest yield of any REIT). I’m fairly certain that AREIT’s price is the result of the organic push and pull of arm’s length buyers and sellers, but what does that say about PREIT?

>- **[CORRECTIONS]** **VREIT:** Yesterday I said that the Q3 dividend was 13% smaller y/y, but its Q3/24 dividend is actually 17% larger than its Q3/23 dividend; I had mistakenly compared this div to the one VREIT declared in Q4/23, which was its largest ever.

1grhtku,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1grhtku/should_i_stop_being_a_sb_for_a_relationship/,should i stop being a SB for a relationship?,"TL;DR: At 21, I’ve been a sugar baby for two years, which has provided me financial independence and access to luxuries like travel, clothes, and saving for the future. However, this lifestyle has also isolated me socially and created anxiety, leaving me longing for real connections. Recently, I met a guy who treats me incredibly well, and we started a genuine, healthy relationship. He doesn’t know about my sugar dating, and I’m scared of how he’d react if he found out. I feel guilty hiding this part of my life from him but am also hesitant to give up the financial freedom that sugar dating gives me. Although I’ve started slowing down on the sugar dating and am exploring other work options, I’m torn between maintaining my lifestyle and staying in the relationship.

i’m 21 years old and have been a “sugar baby” for the past two years while i’ve been in school in new york. my parents pay my rent and for a few other things and i have a nanny job that gives me a bit each week, but sugar dating has opened the door to possibilities i never could have imagined being able to afford at this point in my life from clothes to travel to cosmetic procedures to starting a roth ira and actually being able to consistently save for things i desire. as much as the job is a bit weird, it’s been manageable for me. i’ve curated my clients/daddies to only accepting ones that pay $1000+ and i have a good relationship with. they aren’t people i would ever date or genuinely be attracted to but i consider them friends for the most part and they understand the nature of our relationship.

i also have this guy in my life, we will call G, who i met around a year ago and don’t have a sexual relationship with but still gives me $500 per meet just to have dinner or watch movies with him or go to museums. he is a pretty strange dude. extremely socially awkward and doesn’t have any other people he maintains contact with in his life besides his sister, mom, and me, but ive managed to make it work with him. he’s asked about having a sexual relationship but ive turned him down every time. our relationship is not like it is with the others. he’s a sweet guy and a good person but physically i’m not attracted to him at all and he’s such a simp.. he texts me like 15 times about day telling me how much he loves me or asking how my day was and i barely text him back but for some reason he still sticks around and in the time that we’ve known each other he has started giving around $3-4k extra per month in addition to when we see each other. 

our relationship has always been transactional but it seems he’s gotten that idea a bit skewed in the time that i’ve known him. maybe ive contributed to that narrative but i told him im not looking for an actual relationship and he said that that is ok. the thing is he is extremely obsessive so hanging out with him makes me feel uncomfortable, but i’ve continued to do it because the money is just insane and honestly im a little worried of how it would go over if i were to cut him off.

the sugar baby life hasn’t been all sunshine and rainbows. i’ve become increasingly isolated and private in the past couple years, only maintaining contact with around 5 people consistently and have developed this pretty bad social anxiety in my every day life. i feel like i don’t fit in to normal society and im afraid of being judged. it’s made it hard to relate to people and ive gotten comfortable in a pretty reclusive state because i don’t really have to participate in social settings outside of school. as a naturally introverted person, it’s been fine for the most part but at times ive found myself lonely and longing for a real connection with someone. i feel like an actor in every aspect of my life besides when im with the people im close to. if there’s one thing im good at it’s identifying what people need/are lacking and morphing into the perfect person to fill that void, but it’s not real. 

so here comes the real reason i’m writing on this thread- 

a few months ago (probably 3) i met this guy who has quickly become the highlight of my life. it was extremely unexpected. he approached at a bar the one night in the past 6 months i’ve actually gone out. he took me on a date and ever since we’ve been obsessed with each other. 

i wasn’t looking to date anyone at the time but he is exactly the kind of person i would want to in a relationship with. smart, worldly, caring, generous, fun. he is an absolute angel to me. he sends me food when i’m sick, gets me my favorite coffee every time we are together, takes me on little trips. always makes time for me, listens to me, is extremely physically and verbally affectionate. we started officially dating about 3 weeks ago now and our relationship is already so emotionally passionate and intense. i haven’t had a real relationship like this in years so it’s weird for me. honestly this is probably the only healthy relationship i’ve ever had and im terrified of losing him but he knows nothing about my sugar dating life or G and im terrified of what he would think of me if he found out. 

i think he is an amazing person and i don’t want to hurt him but i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to stop sugar dating. i don’t want to give up the money and the freedom it allows me but i absolutely do not want him to find out about it. he’s a very conventional guy. he has a great job working for some sort of legal consultant company, a great group of friends that all have normal jobs, and doesn’t really do anything off the beaten path. i wish i could tell him but he just wouldn’t understand it at all. he probably has never even considered the possibility that i would be doing something like this cause it’s just not a part of his world.

i’ve been doing it secretly a little bit but ive slowed down a lot. i know im playing with fire. every time im with him im terrified he’s going to go on my phone and see a text from G or something but im so so conflicted. i feel extremely guilty about lying to him but i don’t know what a better option is. maybe i just need to end the relationship but i don’t want to lose him. i feel like i can let go of it eventually. all this stuff with him happened so fast and so intensely. i just don’t think i was really ready when i said yes. 

i think if it came down to losing him or the sugar dates i would chose him but im not completely sure. we are very much in the honey moon stage still and i don’t know if we want the same things long term or if we are truly compatible on a soul mate level. i guess i just don’t want to let go of everything if i don’t know if it will last.

i’ve been taking this bartending class once a week to maybe transition into that and im trying to focus more on my career and getting internships and stuff but the temptation to go on sugar dates is always there. i don’t want to do this forever. i do have career “aspirations” and stuff and i do see myself having a real relationship in the future but i don’t know if im ready to give up the lifestyle that sugar dating has allowed for me rn. making money doing dates makes me feel empowered and by giving it up it feels like im giving up my craft, my independence, and all the things i planned to save for in the coming years. nothing i can do work wise right now will compare to it. i want both but i don’t know if i can sustain that without the guilt eating me alive or it blowing up in my face. what do you think i should do?

the way i see it, these are my options: 
1. break up with him/tell him i need a break and keep sugaring until im ready to stop
2. keep dating him and keep sugar dating but keep it sugar low key and only accept dates that use protection until im ready to stop
3. keep dating him, stop the sexual sugar dates but continue meeting G for dinners and activities in private 
4. tell him about G but not my other sugars and see if he would be ok with me continuing that
5. drop everything to be with him and refocus my energy on trying to build my career and making money in other ways",1,1731625129.0,therapy,1,1.0,False
