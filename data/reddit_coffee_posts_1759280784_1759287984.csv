1. The relationship

He never committed to me as he had a past trauma where his ex cheated on him multiple times and he said he needs time. But we used to be like couples. We used to talk daily and share everything with each other. I was deeply in love with him. We even had sex once and used to get little intimiate sometimes. It was didn't lasted long (only for 6 months) but we came very close. All I used to just think about him. I always had urge of giving him gifts as he comes from a poor financial background and he wanted things and I just wanted him.

2. The Breakup

It ended on a pretty bad note. 
He was like I won't mind doing with other girls as I didn't committed to you and I told him I would leave as i can't see him with someone else. I was about to pay him 15k as a contribution for getting his new iphone but I denied that and he got mad over it. He threatened me and took 15k. Later, I went to his home and I got it back but his entire family got to know about us. And he decided to stop talking to me. Later I told my mum also about everything and that I even wanted to marry him. She was understanding and hugged me.

3. Post breakup scenes

The above two points were just to give a gist of what happened but here is the main thing.
I am finding it really hard to move on.

I have been using reddit like a mad women since he has left as a coping mechanism.
I am binge drinking coffee and tea. My concentration on my fitness and studies have gone to zero. I always feel like being in a small room and just have warmth. I joined gym few months back but I stopped going since he left. I know it may sound weird But exercising would give me more anxiety. A bigger space or even going out gives me more anxiety, so I won't feel like even leaving my room whole day. 

4. Some steps I took to heal myself

- I  tried studying but stopped studying since 29th sept night after I saw his insta profile where he posted a picture of helmet which I gifted him. I know I shouldn't be stalking his insta but I am not able to control myself. 

- I tried talking to my friends but didn't helped.

- Tried watching movies.

- i would always be playing some random comedy videos in bg even while I am studying so that the memories never occupy my mind. And this thing has really helped me alot. But I am not able to follow this anymore. 

- I would try to think negatively about him.

 Thoughts like:

how once he twisted my arm and if he can do that now, then later he would have been more physically violent also. 

Life would be so difficult with him because of his poor financial background.

He looks really bad, even my friends call him a chapri. He even dresses like a chapri and doesn't do grooming at all. 

I curse myself for choosing a guy like him.

I'm female, 26, and at my last check in, weighed 330lbs or 149.6 kg (not good, I know). I'm Hispanic, and come from a 'bigger' family, and have always been overweight even as a child. 

Few months ago, I visited my doctor and told her that I wanted to get serious about losing weight before I hit 30, and for maybe the next two years or so, I have the goal of losing 100 lbs (≈45kg) and she has been prescribing me Phentermine to curb my hunger. It's seriously been helping fight the food cravings and ease me into adopting a calorie deficit. I only eat one big meal a day around lunchtime or a little after lunch, and I take one cup of coffee in  the morning, only with creamer. I'll drink water throughout the day, but if I need or want a flavored drink, a zero cal energy drink, diet juice or tea, or a protein shake will be my go-to. 

Now here's the thing. I feel like if I keep at this rate, I won't meet my goal. I just got a gym membership a few days ago, and have been trying to go frequently. Between working two jobs, I can manage going three times a week for now. My question/predicament here is, what should I really be doing at the gym to burn fat, and at the same time, get some strength training in to minimize my loose skin? I'm aware that due to my current weight and my weight loss goal, I'll have loose skin no matter what, but I want to minimize it as much as I can. Starting out, I've been honing in on cardio, steadily walking at an incline for an hour (about 2 miles for me).

Hashtags: #InternationalCoffeeDay,"Have you tried reading coffee and drinking a book? 🤔 A strange combination, but it opens the door to a different kind of curiosity. The idea turns the tables on the familiar.

Coffee is not just a drink. It's a complete experience that begins with aroma and ends with inspiration. Every sip carries a story, every scent the beginning of a new chapter. An experience written by the senses before words.

And a book is not just words. It's a journey that you begin with a sip of coffee and end with an idea. Every page is a window, and every sip is a key. The book ends, but its impact remains, like the taste of coffee.

Combining the two = an unforgettable session. A session that creates a golden moment, uniting the mind and the heart. A complete experience resembling a work of art.

This is our slogan: #Read\_Coffee\_and\_Drink\_Books. It's not just a hashtag. It's a lifestyle. An invitation to break the routine and create a personal ritual.

What does this phrase mean to you? Do you see it as a metaphor or a new way of thinking? It could be the beginning of a habit that inspires your day.

You know that low-battery anxiety, right? That moment in the afternoon when you see the 20% warning and your plans for the evening suddenly feel threatened. I was a master at the frantic search for any free power outlet in a coffee shop, always making sure I had my charging cable like a lifeline.



It’s funny how used to it I had become, until I started using the iPhone 17. The shift wasn't dramatic at first, just a quiet realization that I was ending most days with 30 or 40 percent left. I stopped carrying a power bank, which was a small but genuine liberation for my pockets. The phone just… lasts.



The most fascinating thing I learned is that a lot of the battery drain on modern phones comes from the constant, tiny communication between apps and their servers in the background. It’s like each app is a little tap, constantly dripping power even when you're not using it. The efficiency of the new chip seems to manage this background chatter so much better, almost like it politely tells apps to wait their turn.



It’s not magic, but it feels like it solved a problem I’d just accepted as part of life. Now, my only concern is remembering what I used to do with that extra space in my bag where the charger lived.

1nuwyja,https://www.reddit.com/r/acidreflux/comments/1nuwyja/i_finally_realized_what_triggers_my_reflux_and/,I finally realized what triggers my reflux — and it’s not food,"Hi everyone,

I want to share something I’ve recently noticed. I’ve had reflux/LPR for over a year, and I honestly thought I’d never find a clear pattern. I tried different diets, cut out coffee, chocolate, alcohol, fatty foods — and yes, sometimes it helped, but not always.

Recently I realized something important:

* When I’m stressed, anxious, or overthinking, I get heartburn and that lump-in-throat feeling even from “safe” foods.
* But when I’m spending time with friends, laughing, feeling joy and relaxed — I can eat even some “trigger” foods and my symptoms are so much lighter.

So for me, the main trigger isn’t food — it’s **stress**.

This was a huge breakthrough for me. Of course, I still need to be mindful of what I eat, but the real improvement came when I started focusing on reducing stress, giving myself more joy, and letting myself rest.

I also realized that I might need extra help with this, so I’m planning to talk to my doctor about possibly starting antidepressants to help manage my anxiety and stress.

Just wanted to share in case it helps someone else notice the same thing 🙏 Have you noticed stress being a bigger trigger than food for your reflux?",2,1759287083.0,acidreflux,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Hanwha Eagles vs. SSG Landers: A Pennant-Clinching Thriller or a Third-Seed Power Nap?**

The KBO’s final regular-season showdown between the **Hanwha Eagles** and **SSG Landers** on October 1, 2025, isn’t just a game—it’s a high-stakes poker match where the pot is a coveted first-place pennant. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this game might be more exciting than watching your neighbor’s lawn grow.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The betting lines make the **Hanwha Eagles** the clear favorite, with implied probabilities hovering around **67-70%** (based on -150 to -170 American odds). The **SSG Landers**, meanwhile, sit at **35-37%**, reflecting their role as the “also-ran” in this pennant race. The spread (-1.5 runs for Hanwha) suggests bookmakers expect a narrow Eagles victory, while the total (8 runs) leans toward a low-scoring, pitcher’s duel.

But here’s the twist: Hanwha’s win probability is inflated by **urgency**, not just skill. They need this game to force a tiebreaker with the LG Twins, who still have a sliver of hope. SSG, on the other hand, is playing for pride and a bye to the playoffs—they’re the sports equivalent of a student who aced the midterm but still shows up to the final just to prove they’re not a fluke.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Emotional Baggage

**Hanwha Eagles**: Fresh off a **1-0 walk-off win** against the Lotte Giants, Hanwha’s offense is as reliable as a coffee shop barista on a Monday morning—sometimes there, sometimes not. Their ace, **Cody Ponce**, is on the mound, and while his ERA isn’t the sexiest stat in KBO history, his ability to avoid walks (just 1.2 per game this season) could be key. The Eagles’ defense, though, is a sieve. They’ve committed more errors than a first grader in a spelling bee. But hey, in a 1-0 game, you don’t need a Gold Glove—you need a “don’t panic” attitude.

**SSG Landers**: SSG is the KBO’s version of a well-oiled toaster—consist

To avoid having one hand on the camera and the other on the prism, I improvised a kind of adapter using a coffee cup. That way, the prism could stay in front of the lens without me having to hold it, and it could somehow anchor to the lens.

However, this setup has turned out to be quite impractical, and since I want to keep working this way, I’d like to make a proper adapter that works better. Ideally, I’d like the prism to be able to rotate on its own axis but also around the lens circumference (I attached a reference image—I hope it makes sense).

I looked up ways to make DIY lenses, but most of the results are about optics, glass types, and that sort of thing. Does anyone know where I could find more information, or what I should search for to help me make this adapter? Also, opinions on how viable this is.

* Price: 384,000 ARS (pickup and dropoff from and to your hotel in El Calafate) - 320,000 ARS self transport to Parque Nacional Los Glaciares
* Obligatory bringing gloves (bring your own ones, in El Calafate they cost between 18,000 - 80,000 ARS)
* Bring waterproof pair of shoes - I had trailrunners on me and I do not recommend it
* Bring second pair of socks
* It is raining a lot! Don´t forget to bring a rain jacket
* There is no option to buy food on the trek. After the hike on the glacier you will walk back to the Refugio with your team and there you will take the ferry and bus trip back to the starting point. There you can buy something to eat and drink (a cup of coffee costs 5,000 ARS for example)
* You can use the ISIC Student Card for a reduced entry fee to the Parque Nacional Los Glaciares (I paid 7,000 ARS instead of 45,000 ARS)
* At the end, you will have 1 hour to do the pasarelas (Walking down the pathway with a great view to the glaciers)

Do I recommend it? Absolutely! The views are stunning and the walk on the glaciers are a great experience. Any questions, feel free to ask!

I recently discovered about AIP and ive decided to give it a try. It feels like a bold step for me, especially since i realized how much my current diet is off track compared to AIP. Transitioning will not be easy because i will need to cut out many foods i eat daily.

What i find most challenging is that i smoke, drink coffee, I eat a lot of dairy products and rely heavily on grains. For example, i usually have eggs for breakfast and i am used to eating rice, quinoa and pasta with almost every meal. Removing these will definitely be a big adjustment for me. 

Ive started already working on gradually quitiing smoking and coffee and i am also planning my upcoming groceries to align with AIP. I know it might take some time before i can fully follow the protocol but i'm committed to move in that direction.

1nuwr70,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dream/comments/1nuwr70/one_of_my_wildest_dreams_yet/,One of my wildest dreams yet.,"Had one of the most surreal dreams last night — it felt like a mix of Detroit: Become Human, GTA V, and a nightmare travel story.

It started on public transit, where I got stuck after trying to use the bathroom and the train left without me. From there, I kept bouncing between different buses and trains, never making it home, just ending up farther away. Eventually, I wound up in Niagara Falls.

That’s where things really shifted. I got on this double-decker sightseeing bus, and suddenly there was an attack inside — chaos, people hurt, fear everywhere. It was graphic, and I remember the tension of not feeling safe, like one of those real-world transit incidents you sometimes see in the news.

The bus eventually pulled away, and I was hiding behind a corner, peeking out. I watched it veer left into a tunnel, with an older man driving — maybe around 60. The whole scene felt ominous, like it was being swallowed up by something I was glad to escape.

Then the dream shifted again: the bus somehow ended up at an airport in the middle of winter, with rows of cars buried in snow. For some reason, every car was unlocked. I first climbed into an ordinary SUV, but then I found this bright red, futuristic-looking Tesla-style car. The moment I got in and started driving, it felt completely different — smooth, fast, powerful, like I had finally broken free of the nightmare system I was trapped in.

There were strange characters too — a sharp, tough-looking bald man who felt both threatening and important, and later a scene where I was suddenly serving coffee to strangers at tables, like I had become the one providing comfort after all that chaos.

The wildest part? The whole thing was anchored at Niagara Falls. I saw the actual waterfalls in the dream, and the backdrop made everything feel even more surreal — like unstoppable natural power flowing while the human world around it was dystopian and broken.

The clock is nearing 05:00 (5:00 AM), and the Turtles plus Karai are all fast asleep in their beds.

The **adhān (الأذان)** can be heard, ticking Raphael Hamato (voice of Sean Astin) off. 

Raphael Hamato: ""EXCUSE ME?! I'm trying to sleep! You don't have to yell whatever you are yelling in my ears!"" 

*Leonardo Hamato (voice of Jason Biggs) slaps Raphael Hamato across the back of his head.* 

Leonardo Hamato: ""Raph, it's only the call to prayer. Donnie and I talked about what we'd expect when we're living here in Saudi Arabia. It's Fajr salāh *(الصلاة الفجر/dawn prayer)* already."" 

Raphael Hamato: ""Couldn't they have been quieter when doing this call to prayer?! I'm trying to sleep through the night with comfort and they woke me up with this?!"" 

*Meanwhile, Donatello Hamato (voice of Rob Paulsen) and Michelangelo Hamato (voice of Greg Cipes) are still fast asleep, Donatello Hamato slightly smiles to the sounds of the adhān heard from meters away.* 

*Skip forward to 07:30 (7:30 AM), the Turtles and Karai have finished their breakfast; simple cups of coffee and plates of bread, cucumbers, dates, falafel, hummus, olives and tomatoes; and they're off to secondary school.* 

Raphael Hamato: ""Man, the breakfast Saudi Arabia has to offer? Lame.""

1nuwph3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1nuwph3/craziest_dream_ive_had_in_years/,Craziest dream I’ve had in years.,"Had one of the most surreal dreams last night — it felt like a mix of Detroit: Become Human, GTA V, and a nightmare travel story.

It started on public transit, where I suddenly realized the train or bus had pulled away while I was still inside, even though I wasn’t sure why I was there in the first place. From that point on, I was stuck, being carried farther and farther away. I kept bouncing between different buses and trains, but instead of getting home I somehow ended up in Niagara Falls.

That’s where things really shifted. I got on this double-decker sightseeing bus, and suddenly there was an attack inside — chaos, people hurt, fear everywhere. It was graphic, and I remember the tension of not feeling safe, like one of those real-world transit incidents you sometimes see in the news.

The bus eventually pulled away again, and I was hiding behind a corner, peeking out. I watched it veer left into a tunnel, with an older man driving, maybe around 60. The whole scene felt ominous, like it was being swallowed up by something I was glad to escape.

Then the dream shifted again: the bus somehow ended up at an airport in the middle of winter, with rows of cars buried in snow. For some reason, every car was unlocked. I first climbed into an ordinary SUV, but then I found this bright red, futuristic-looking Tesla-style car. The moment I got in and started driving, it felt completely different — smooth, fast, powerful, like I had finally broken free of the nightmare system I was trapped in.

There were strange characters too — a sharp, tough-looking bald man who felt both threatening and important, and later a scene where I was suddenly serving coffee to strangers at tables, like I had become the one providing comfort after all that chaos.

The wildest part? The whole thing was anchored at Niagara Falls. I saw the actual Clifton Hill in the dream, that’s where the bus was driving, and the backdrop made everything feel even more surreal — like unstoppable natural power flowing while the human world around it was dystopian and broken.

It was both incredible and terrifying, with this heavy feeling of grief running through it.",2,1759286343.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

I don't know why Breville lists this roaster for their free beans program. It has to be the absolute worst coffee ever.

Got 2 bags of this junk. It's supposed to be 'medium dark', but any darker, and it would combust into ashes I think. It has a burnt and smoky smell. (Maybe for people that like French Roast ? Which I absolutely detest.)

I've tried Breville supplied Equator coffee Jaguar espresso, and while that wasn't great either, it was way better than this!

For reference,

* Intelligentsia Black Cat Espresso is good.
* Intelligentsia House Blend makes good espresso.
* Lots of beans from Counter Culture make good espresso.
* Lots of beans from Stumptown make good espresso.
* Even Costco's Kirkland single source organic beans make really good espresso.

1nuwiu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CheckTurnitin/comments/1nuwiu2/two_groupmates_are_accusing_each_other_of_using/,Two groupmates are accusing each other of using AI on a shared Google Doc and I’m the TA stuck in the middle. Coffee is not enough.,"So I’m a TA for a writing-intensive gen ed, which means I’m essentially a referee with a grading spreadsheet. Last night at 12:48 AM, I got two frantic emails from members of the same group. Subject lines are identical except for the names. Both are accusing the other of using AI to write the lit review section in their shared Google Doc. I open the doc and it looks like two interns fought over the same Wikipedia page. The version history is chaos. One person keeps pasting paragraphs that read like a grant proposal, the other is rewriting them into something more human, then we ping-pong back to uncanny valley. Every sentence has that smooth plastic texture like it was sanded by a robot and then proofread by Grammarly on espresso. Now both students want me to file academic misconduct reports - on each other. They both claim the other is “clearly using AI” because of the “vocabulary spikes” and “unusual sentence cadence.” One even pasted an AI detection screenshot that says 76 percent likely AI, which, cool, but that tool is not something we use as evidence. We’ve said this every week. It’s in the syllabus. It’s in the slides. It’s in my dreams. Complication number two: our policy allows some AI use for brainstorming and outlining as long as it’s disclosed and the final text is original. Neither has any disclosure. Also, one of them cited a paper that literally does not exist, and when I asked for a PDF, I got a link to a journal volume that stops at page 112 while their reference is page 147. So now I’m suspicious of both and I’ve had two cold brews and half a bag of pretzels for breakfast. My professor is at a conference till Wednesday. The assignment is due Friday. The group has two other members who are silent and presumably hiding under their desks. I can force a pause on grading and ask for individual statements, but that delays the whole class and I am so tired. Has anyone handled the mutual-accusation AI thing in a shared doc? I’m leaning toward: freeze the doc, export version history, require each student to submit a signed reflection with drafts, notes, and source trails; then grade only what I can attribute. If I can’t attribute, I zero the disputed sections and have them redo individually. Is that fair, or am I recreating the Inquisition with a Google Drive?",3,1759285815.0,CheckTurnitin,3,1.0,False

1nuwggu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nuwggu,My roommate sold furniture that wasn’t even hers and dumped my stuff on the floor,"So when I first moved in, I took over the lease from the old roommate who left halfway through his term. He had to leave in a rush and couldn’t fit some of his furniture in the U-Haul, so he left behind a dining table, a little coffee-table type thing, and a TV stand. My current roommate was already living here back then, and for the past three years we’ve both just been using that stuff in the shared space like normal.

She’s moving out this January. Last night she asked if I wanted to keep the furniture. I said yeah, but then she hit me with “you’ll have to pay for them.” I didn’t say yes or no, just told her I needed a little time, because I wanted to check with the old roommate if he actually sold the furniture to her or just left it behind. Plus, she was asking way over the original prices (like $150 for a $99 Ikea TV stand).

Fast forward to today: I come home from work and… everything’s gone. She sold all of it. My stuff that was on the TV stand was just dumped on the floor. She literally asked me about it last night, didn’t even give me a day to think, and just went ahead and sold it.

I’m pissed. Very angry. We’ve been really good friends and on great terms, which is why this feels so much worse. And honestly, I don’t think any of that furniture was even hers to begin with.

Should I confront her about this or just let it go?

Interview With The Sandman
(A reimagining of Jeff The Killer by Sessuer‘s and GameFuelTv’s)

	He tapped his hand in a rhythmic pattern. The same two taps, then a pause. Three, pause, then two again. He sat, cuffs pinning him to the table, face covered in sparse strands of long dark hair. A line of drool had been flowing from his obscured mouth, collecting on the cold metal, before unceremoniously dripping onto the floor. He breathed slowly, wheezing, like he had smoked since birth. In, hollow. Out, raspy. 

	Detective Simmons stood on the other side of a one-way mirror, watching him. Taking one hand to rub his eyes, he sighed deeply,  then trailed his fingers down to smooth out his mustache. He was a portly man in his 40s, ginger hair covered by a brimmed police hat, tired eyes that never seemed to blink. He stood, slouching slightly, before jumping at the sound of the door opening. 

	“Oh shi-, sorry sir!” Andy yelled into the room as he entered, “I brought the coffee.”

	Andy was a younger man, with a heavily freckled face, framed by curly brown hair that fell on either side of his face. 

	“Jus- just put it on the table, Richards.” Simmons wearily replied, before returning his gaze to the glass. Gingerly, Andy set the cheap disposable cups on the table behind Simmons. He went to stand beside Simmons, his unprofessional hoodie swaying as he turned, as his badge haphazardly hung from his belt.

	For a moment he stood in silence, staring along with Simmons. The silence almost seemed loud, like the air itself whispered underneath each exhale.They stood, watching the man behind the glass, before Andy broke the stillness, coughing aloud.

	“So, who’s he?”

	Simmons didn’t take his eyes off the glass, “He’s an old case - Jeffery Woods. About 20 years back he committed triple homicide on his family, burned their house down, and then three more killed after that.”
	
	Andy broke his gaze to look at Simmons. “So why’s he here then? Isn’t the case solved? Day saved and all that?”

“It might not be,” Simmons replied, “there’s been a new string of murders, all the same M.O.; throat sliced open, with the mouth carved as well.” He rubbed his eye again, still seemingly never having blinked.

“So, a copycat killer?”

“Nah, can’t be,” Simmons sighed. 

“What do you mean?”

“Can’t be, the deaths are too similar. Some of the details that weren't released have been mimicked.” Simmons broke his gaze from the glass for a moment, looking at Andy,  “The witnesses also give a description that’s the same as our guy here.”

“Y’know,” Andy started, laughing under his breath, “seeing him now, he doesn’t look as scary as I thought. Kids used to tell plenty of stories about him.”

“Ugh,” Simmons grunted, turning his head back, “not the sorta thing a kid should be hearin’ about.”

“Well some have tvs playing while parents don’t pay attention,” Andy began, a hint of excitement in his voice. “They hear the news of some killer, and are fascinated with it. Before you know it they’re sharing with other kids, who also share it, and boom - new neighborhood boogeyman.”

“Personal experience, Richards?”  Simmons mumbled, barely trying to be heard.

“Heh, you could say that. We called him ‘Jeff The Killer’. Dumb name looking back on it.” 

As Andy finished, Simmons turned to the table, grabbing his coffee.

“We’re gonna keep this simple, by the books. Don’t let on that someone’s out there killing people. Less he knows, less he’ll hide. Got that?”

Andy raised his hand in a mock salute. “Aye aye o’ captain my captain.”

Simmons grumbled, shaking his head as he reached for his radio.

“Cooper, this is Simmons. We’re ready to begin.”

*
Andy and Simmons sat opposite of him. He didn’t acknowledge their entrance, and just kept tapping on the table. Closer up you could see his breath push his hair forward slightly. He had brought it forward, trying to cover all of his face, though it made the rest of his balding head more obvious. His chest heaved, every breath a focused effort. 

Simmons was the first to speak. 

“Jeffery Woods, I’m detective Simmons, and this is officer Richards.” He spoke clearly, calmly. Like a parent speaking to a young child, not wanting to startle or upset them. 

He continued, ”We just want to ask you a few questions, can you do that?” 
	
All at once, Jeff stopped tapping. His breathing was silent, as he sat up in his chair. His hair fell to either side of his face, like curtains revealing a stage. Rather than a fantastical set piece, a pale, burned face was unveiled. 

He was disgusting, there was no way around it. His skin was pale, almost white, with healed burns framing parts of his face. His mouth was filled with stained yellow teeth, crooked with rotten gums, all clearly visible from his cut mouth and shriveled lips. His slashed mouth was stitched, though many of them had torn and hung loose from the scars. His right eye was a pale brown, the other was long blinded, cocked far to the left. He had no nose, it was long gone. In its place were just two small holes he wheezily breathed from.  He smiled, always. It was hard to tell if it was just his carved face or if he consciously grinned at all times; maybe it was both. 

“I remember you,” he spoke. His voice was gravelly, raspy, like sandpaper across your ears. 

“Yes, I interviewed you a long time ago now,” Simmons said, “we just want to ask you a few questions.”

Jeff cocked his head to the side, staring into Andy. He jumped once his eyes fell on him, and Jeff said, “You’re new… different.”

“Uh, ye- yeah,” Andy replied, almost shaking, “I’m, I'm new.”

Jeff stared for a moment, before turning his head back to Simmons, his neck audibly cracking. His eyes widened, mouth stretching, as he spoke.

“Ask away, Gerald.”

“Please Jeff,” Simmons sighed, looking down at the table for a moment, “Just call me Simmons.”

Jeff just continued to stare at him for a moment, his eye ever so slightly twitching. Simmons looked up, before opening a manilla folder previously under his arm. 

“You remember your mother, right Jeff?”

“Oh yes, I remember,” he began, his voice creaky, almost cooing. “She was just a doll. Kind, calm, but stern. Always worried about her boys, but never enough to do anything for them.”

He gestured at his face, or, at least he tried to with his restricted hands. 

“I still remember when she first saw… this. She was so scared, a great wailing mess.”

“Alright,” Simmons quietly continued, glancing at Andy, who nervously brought his hands away from the table, placing him in his lap. 

“What do you remember about your father?”

Jeff straightened his back as he heard this, 

“Ah, cranky old man. Don’t ever remember seeing him smile. Just always tired from his job, too tired for any of us.”

“Did he ever strike you, as punishment?” 

“No, that would require giving a single damn about his kids. That's something he couldn’t try to muster up.” 

	“Is that why you killed him?” Andy blurted suddenly. Both Simmons and Jeff turned over to look at him, both surprised by him speaking. 

	Jeff chuckled, a sound like a broken exhaust pipe. 

	“You… you’re catching on, rookie. Good head on those shoulders.” He looked into Andy’s eyes, rising in his chair. “Make sure you don’t lose it.”

“Back to your family, Jeff.” Simmons loudly spoke. Jeff looked back to Simmons, and returned to his seat. 

“Yeah, Dad was so unhappy, all the damn time. Up until I made him smile, and smile, and then,” he made the motion of his hand falling down. 

Simmons flipped a page in the manilla folder, tracing his finger as he read. Andy held his hand, coiled in a fist, up to his mouth. Simmons looked up and spoke again.

“You had a brother, right?”

Jeff’s eye widened, “Oh yes. He was such a good guy. Real defensive, always keeping kids off my back. Too bad, too bad he’s gone.”

“He defended you, yet you killed him?”

“Nah nah nah, don’t get it twisted,” Jeff replied, shaking his head. “What happened, he did to himself. Now he’s happy, just like me.” 

“Why, what did he do?” Andy asked, drawn in. Jeff glanced at him for a moment, then just went quiet.

Simmons shot a look at Andy, before loudly clearing his throat.

“Your family was found dead in your home, which had been set on fire,” He began. “We just want to know why.”

 Simmons and Andy waited intently, looking for any changes in Jeff's mood. 

Jeff tilted his head slightly, grunting quietly.

 “They didn’t want to share in the joy.”

“What is ‘the joy’?”

“This,” Jeff pointed at himself, “Is the joy. I;m filled with it. A face like mine knows nothing but smiles, and you can’t help but try and share in the excitement!” 

Andy’s face scrunched up in disgust, like he’d eaten a sour fruit. Simmons simply sat back in his chair, continuing to look through the file.

“I mean, most people refuse, and that’s when I,” Jeff made the motion of slicing his throat, “And then, they go to sleep. I give them a smile, and they’re happy, forever.” 

Andy pounded his fist on the table, shouting into Jeff’s face,

“So that’s your excuse? You killed three of your family because they wouldn’t be ‘happy’ like you?!”

“Richards!” Simmons yelled, standing up from his chair. Jeff began laughing, hysterically. He almost fell back in his chair, but the cuffs kept him leaning forward. 

“Hah aha haha, three? Ahahahahahaaaaa!”

“Now, calm down Jeff,” Simmons started, sitting back in his seat. His voice had become a smooth, calming tone, “I promise Richards will not be upsetting you again.”

He shot a fiery look at Andy, like he was trying to turn him to stone. Andy slumped back in his chair, ashamed.

“Now then,” Simmons continued, “can you tell me about the others you… put to sleep.”

Jeff began settling back in his chair, stopping his manic giggles. 

“Hah, oh yes. Troy, Keith, and Randy. We weren’t on the best terms, different clicks, high school bull, you get the idea. ”

Simmons sat forward slightly, “No, you didn’t.”

“Well it was at a bus stop, and they were acting all tough, giving us dirty looks. We tried told em to fuck off, but they starting getting in our faces. So we fought em’, and we got in trouble for it!”

“Your brother fought them as well, right?” 

Jeff’s ever present grin widened, “Oh of course, but even both of us couldn’t beat all three of them. At least, not until later…”

“What do you-” Simmons was cut off by knocking at the door. He jumped slightly in his chair, before going up to open it.

“I’ll be right back, don’t talk to him until I get back, okay Richards?”

Andy quietly nodded, “Ye-, yes sir.”

Simmons nodded, walking out of the room. Andy sat silently, looking down at the table, trying everything not to stare. Jeff breathed heavily, almost like a happy dog. He stared at Andy, trying to get even a moment of accidental eye contact. Andy tried with all his power to not look back, knowing Jeff's eyes were on him, burning a hole in his head. For just a moment, he broke, and looked back.

Seeing his opportunity, Jeff began, “You’re a detective, right Andy?”

Andy wanted to ignore him, but saw himself answering him. 

“Uh, no. Just an officer.”

“But you wanna be one, right? That’s why Gerald’s bringing you around.” 

Andy shrugged, looking up at Jeff. “I mean, yeah.”

“So tell me this,” Jeff continued, “I have been in here for 20 years, yet someone is out there looking and acting like me.”

“How do you-” Andy attempted, before being cut off.

“But how could that be? Well, let me ask you this, what happens to someone’s fingerprints when they’re burned?”

Andy stood up, backing away from the table as Jeff continued.

“Now, who could look the most like me, who isn’t me?” Jeff continued, staring down Andy while speaking. “Or,,, who could I look like most?” 

Andy had fully backed up to the mirror, his chest heaving in panicked breaths. His mouth was open, gasping for any air. He kept his eyes on… whoever sat at the table before him. Suddenly, he nearly jumped as someone knocked at the door again. He gasped for a moment, leaning over, holding himself up by grasping his knees. His breath returning to him, he walked to the door.

As he opened the door, he saw Simmons standing on the other side. He grinned and opened his mouth to speak, but lost all words as Simmons slumped forward. Andy stepped back, gazing at the knife planted deep in Simmons’s back, before looking up to his killer.

There, standing tall above him, was the face of the real Sandman. Black greasy hair draped down to his shoulders, tangled and unkept. Burns dominated his face, scarred over muscles twisted and warped almost inhumanly, dotted with wisps of scraggly facial hair. A wide, torn smile filled with yellowed teeth. A mere hole for a nose, below two bloodshot eyes, crazed and filled with fire. He wore a dirty and bloodied sweatshirt over his muscled body, above tattered and stained pants and boots.

Andy stumbled back, his breath hitching in his lungs from the sight of Jeff. 

“Time to play Liu,” the killer growled from under his breath. 

With a snap, Andy felt his air ripped from him, as Liu brought the chain of his cuffs to his throat. 

“Shhh,” he hummed, free from his bindings. 

Liu wrestled Andy to the ground, as Jeff took the knife from Simmons’s back.He tried clutching at the chain cutting off his air, but Liu’s strength was too much. He gasped desperately for air, trying with everything he had to fight back, wildly kicking and thrashing. But it was no use.

As the life left his lungs, the last thing Andy saw was the real Jeffery Woods bring a knife to his mouth. The man once cuffed to the table was never the Woods Killer, just his brother, a 20 year decoy. He felt the knife pierce his flesh, slitting open his mouth, as the real Jeff whispered.

1. The relationship

He never committed to me as he had a past trauma where his ex cheated on him multiple times and he said he needs time. But we used to be like couples. We used to talk daily and share everything with each other. I was deeply in love with him. We even had sex once and used to get little intimiate sometimes. It was didn't lasted long (only for 6 months) but we came very close. All I used to just think about him. I always had urge of giving him gifts as he comes from a poor financial background and he wanted things and I just wanted him.

2. The Breakup

It ended on a pretty bad note. 
He was like I won't mind doing with other girls as I didn't committed to you and I told him I would leave as i can't see him with someone else. I was about to pay him 15k as a contribution for getting his new iphone but I denied that and he got mad over it. He threatened me and took 15k. Later, I went to his home and I got it back but his entire family got to know about us. And he decided to stop talking to me. Later I told my mum also about everything and that I even wanted to marry him. She was understanding and hugged me.

3. Post breakup scenes

The above two points were just to give a gist of what happened but here is the main thing.
I am finding it really hard to move on.

I have been using reddit like a mad women since he has left as a coping mechanism.
I am binge drinking coffee and tea. My concentration on my fitness and studies have gone to zero. I always feel like being in a small room and just have warmth. I joined gym few months back but I stopped going since he left. I know it may sound weird But exercising would give me more anxiety. A bigger space or even going out gives me more anxiety, so I won't feel like even leaving my room whole day. 

4. Some steps I took to heal myself

- I  tried studying but stopped studying since 29th sept night after I saw his insta profile where he posted a picture of helmet which I gifted him. I know I shouldn't be stalking his insta but I am not able to control myself. 

- I tried talking to my friends but didn't helped.

- Tried watching movies.

- i would always be playing some random comedy videos in bg even while I am studying so that the memories never occupy my mind. And this thing has really helped me alot. But I am not able to follow this anymore. 

- I would try to think negatively about him.

 Thoughts like:

how once he twisted my arm and if he can do that now, then later he would have been more physically violent also. 

Life would be so difficult with him because of his poor financial background.

He looks really bad, even my friends call him a chapri. He even dresses like a chapri and doesn't do grooming at all. 

I curse myself for choosing a guy like him.

But none of the above measures is helping me to get over.

1nuwean,https://www.reddit.com/r/RenalCats/comments/1nuwean/how_do_i_know_if_its_time/,How do I know if it's time?,"My cat is about 14-15 years old. Hyperthyroid but controlled with methimazole, already a bit skinny with a couple UTI's behind her in the last year or so that she recovered from fine. Last blood work about 4 months ago perfect. However I know kidney values take a while to show up. Honestly with what's occurred I now suspect acute on chronic kidney disease.

She presented with a UTI August 26, with inappetence leading up to it; it's been downhill from there. Treated with antibiotics and Odansetron from emergency vet, but follow up cystocentesis showed the infection didn't clear completely;  our normal vet did a different antibiotic, a long-lasting injection, on Sept. 5. Urine cultures from the emergency vet and my normal vet showed E. coli that is susceptible to the antibiotics we used. 

September 5th I also had blood work run at my normal vet. Values next day revealed basically stage IV BUN/Creatinine/SDMA values plus anemia. We change to a renal diet and begin 100ml/day of fluids immediately. I also start Famotidine on 9/7, 5mg twice a day a bit before mealtimes. Odansetron restarted, 2mg twice a day on 9/8.

Follow up from home urine collection one week later showed a little bit of bacteria, so we did yet another round of antibiotics from 9/18, completed 9/25.

Prior to the diagnosis I was already using Mirataz off and on for bouts of inappetence; I've now been using it at half dosage daily since about the 10th of September. About a week into starting fluids I got vitamin B added to the IV bag(s). Still 100ml daily.

New blood work 9/26. Kidney values (BUN, Creatinine, SDMA) much improved but still stage IV by any definition I can find. Anemia (hematocrit) is worse. We start Varenzin the 26th, but she vomited (not an issue until that day). Next day 9/27 unwilling to eat much on her own, so I syringe feed; we try Varenzin at half dose, we still vomit. However, that may be on me since I think I gave her too large of a meal via syringe.

9/28 still half dose of Varenzin, won't eat anything on her own, so syringe smaller meals; no vomiting. 9/29 decide to not give Varenzin any longer.

Food is the biggest challenge; I got a phosphorus binder on 9/17 to expand our options, but not much luck with anything I've tried; wet, dry, prescription, different textures, ""people food"", all very limited luck. She'll eat lil soups and churus, but not much. She drinks a decent amount of water.

Since this latest disaster with the Varenzin she has gotten much weaker; she still makes it to the litter box and to bed with us (got her stairs around a week after first UTI diagnosis), and gets up to drink. A week ago she still seemed to be feeling pretty good. Scratches her horizontal scratcher, crinkles her mat, ""bothers"" us for attention. Sleeps a lot, but that's not unusual for her as an older cat.

But she's wasting away, and she absolutely hates being syringe fed. Even at the ""high"" point about a week ago she was not taking in enough calories on her own to maintain her current too-low weight. Up until the Varenzin she acted excited for food, but takes a long time to eat even a small amount. No teeth issues, no ulcers. Just hovers, takes a few desperate bites like she is hungry (probably the mirataz) then stops. Based on what I'm reading, this is probably the anemia.

I medicate her at least 3 times daily: twice with anti-nausea and antacid, and once more with her methimazole. I know from past experience a missed dose of the thyroid med means vomiting. I also give her the half dose of transdermal mirataz and fluids. She tolerates all of this fine.I brush her and spend quality time petting her in hopes that I don't just end up as someone that does a bunch of unpleasant stuff to her, and to try to enjoy what time we have left. Days I or my partner are home all day we offer her small amounts of food or treats multiple times a day; if we are working we still make multiple offers in the mornings/evenings when we are there. Generally she has to be enticed into eating anything with a little treat or tricks like drumming our fingers on her bowl to get her attention.

She's eating a bit better today, but with the anemia worsening and her weight so low I don't see an out for us. She's very weak, especially in the back end, but doesn't seem to be suffering; more than anything she's just tired. I don't want to call it too late and have her suffer unnecessarily, and I don't want to drag her through anything else that's going to make her vomit or go out on a note of more acute suffering.

Reading Tanya's CKD page, anemia seems like no big deal, but with our values worsening I know without treatment it's just a matter of time, and other treatments have their own risks. It really sunk in when I read another comment here from u/CatsCoffeeCurls:

 ""Anemic cats take a long time to finish their food while they're still eating. Fussiness around food becomes a huge battle, too. They want to eat. They'll even show up at the bowl. They won't (can't) bring themselves to do it, then give up bothering altogether.""

That is her to a tee. She'll either go out starved or I can drag her through another month or two by force-feeding. We could try another anemia solution or stick with the Varenzin, but they all have their own side effects.

I've made an appointment for home euthanasia on Thursday evening. I just want some assurance it's the right decision. I got this cat as a teenager; she was the first pet I ever raised from a baby. She trusts me so much; she'll let me do just about anything to her, from baths to meds to fluids and syringe feeds. But I know she hates being syringe fed; she tries to escape but is too weak to do so. She also hates having her back end cleaned, but that is really only necessary every 2-3 days based on her eating and litter box habits. Both the cleaning and syringe feeds would be necessary to avoid further weight loss or irritation/another UTI on the back end.

I just want to let her rest--I feel like we both gave it a fighting chance this past impossible month, but there's hardly anything left of her body. She's a 2 on the body condition at best, but probably a 1. She lost 3 more ounces the past three weeks. Her legs are weak because her body is eating the muscles.

She's my baby and I want to do right by her. She was perked up a bit today and ate a little of a different wet food we hadn't tried yet, fairly enthusiastically. I've got tomorrow with her, but on Thursday if I go through with this I will give her a gabapentin that morning to avoid anxiety from a ""stranger"" in her house (our vet for her whole life, but she's very anxious of people outside my partner and I) and she'll be pretty out of it for the day. Then it will be over. No more good or bad days. Just rest for her, and memories and grief for me, and hopefully assurance that I made the right call.

I just don't know what the right call is. I felt so assured this morning of my course as she stumbled and weakly struggled against a small syringe of Tiki Cat Thrive. But then she ate better this evening with such enthusiasm. 

She's still stumbling from how bad her back legs are. I'm worried if I wait she'll just waste to the point of abject suffering and be completely unable to get up, or else have some sort of acute event. My partner and I are often both at work during the day--I dread coming home to find that she's had to sit in her own waste because she became too weak to move out of it, or that something else has gone wrong and she's suffered alone until one of us makes it. I'm off work until next Monday; my vet will respect it if I decide to cancel or reschedule her appointment.

She trusts me so much, and I love her to pieces. Should I ignore the numbers and give her a bit longer to either perk up or waste further away? Or should I miss her a little earlier but let her go out while she still has some quality of life. I feel biased either way--I wonder if I'm choosing euthanasia as an out because I'm so exhausted, but if I keep going I'll worry I'm dragging her poor little body though Hell just so I can feel better about things. I've never had to make this final call before. I've never had an animal trust me this intrinsically. I need to do right by her.",1,1759285450.0,RenalCats,1,1.0,False

*Where Football Meets Farce, and the Eagles Soar*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The Eagles (-218 moneyline) are the clear favorites here, with implied odds of \~68% to win. The Broncos (+264) offer a tempting underdog shot (\~27.7% implied), but let’s not confuse “tempting” with “sensible.” The spread is Eagles -3.5 (-110), and the total is set at 43.5 points (evens).

Why the lopsided line? The Eagles are 4-0 with a flair for the dramatic, including a *fake tush push touchdown* that’d make a yoga instructor blush. QB Jalen Hurts is a Swiss watch: 609 yards, 5 TDs, 0 picks, and 4 rushing scores. Meanwhile, the Broncos (2-2) rely on J.K. Dobbins’ legs (323 yards, 3 TDs) but have a defense that’s about as leaky as a sieve at a soda factory.

The key number here? **Field position**. The Eagles’ defense ranks 5th in DVOA, while Denver’s 24th. Translation: The Broncos’ “run-heavy” attack will sputter like a Prius in a hurricane against Philly’s front seven.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Celebrity Fandom

The Eagles? Clean bill of health. Saquon Barkley is back to dodging tackles like they’re exes, and Hurts is riding a four-game TD streak that’s making Statisticians weep into their coffee. Their only “injury” is opponents’ morale—crushed after Philly’s 31-25 Bucs dismantling.

The Broncos? Fresh off a Monday Night win over Cincinnati, but their “resilience” includes a one-point loss to the Colts and a three-point drubbing by the Chargers. J.K. Dobbins is healthy, but Denver’s offensive line? A Jenga tower after a few too many beers.

And yes, 25 celebrities are Broncos fans. Good for them. Let them cling

1nuw9jb,https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/1nuw9jb/why_people_pleasing_will_ruin_your_relationships/,Why people pleasing will ruin your relationships (I learned this the hard way),"I used to say yes to everything. Every request, every plan, every favor. I thought being agreeable would make people like me more.

Instead, I lost myself completely and watched my relationships fall apart one by one.

Here's the uncomfortable truth about people pleasing that nobody talks about:

You become invisible .When you never have opinions, preferences, or boundaries, people forget you exist. You're just the person who goes along with whatever. There's nothing interesting or memorable about you.

People lose respect for you. Deep down, everyone knows when someone has no backbone. They might use your niceness, but they don't respect it. Respect comes from knowing you'll stand up for what matters to you.

You attract the wrong people. Users, manipulators, and selfish people LOVE people pleasers. They can sense you won't say no. Meanwhile, healthy people get uncomfortable around someone with zero boundaries.

Your relationships become one-sided. You give everything, they take everything. Then you get resentful because ""you do so much for them"" but they never reciprocate. But you never asked them to—you just assumed they should.

Nobody knows the real you. How can someone love you if you never show them who you actually are? You're so busy being what you think they want that your real personality disappears.

You become exhausted and bitter. Saying yes when you mean no is emotionally draining. Eventually, you start resenting everyone for ""making"" you do things you chose to do.

How to break the cycle:

Start saying no to small things ""I can't grab coffee today"" or ""That movie isn't really my thing."" Practice with low-stakes situations first.

Express actual preferences like ""I'd prefer pizza over sushi"" or ""I'm not really into horror movies."" Let people know you have opinions.

Set tiny boundaries ""I don't check work emails after 8PM"" or ""I need 30 minutes to myself when I get home."" Start small and build up.

Stop apologizing for having needs ""I need to leave by 9"" not ""Sorry, I'm so lame but I have to leave early."" Your needs aren't an apology.

Some people will get upset when you stop people pleasing. Good. Those are the people who were only around because you were convenient.

The right people will respect you more for having boundaries. And you'll finally have space for relationships where you can be yourself.

Healthy relationships need two whole people, not one person and their shadow. That's my hard realization after years of people pleasing.

I admittedly have needed it to survive the last few days with my kids and honestly I'm not feeling quite right as of now. 

Secondly, do any of you experience tremors without an actual seizure? Is this a sign of an impending seizure? 

I've personally been noticing a couple of things with myself of late. Tremors definitely but also numbness, pins and needles and pretty severe forgetfulness. I mean yesterday I paid and then actually walked off without my wallet. Super unlike me. I can also tell that my husband is getting concerned.

Moreover, I've often been experiencing numbness with pins and needles throughout my legs, feet and hands simultaneously. However, I'm conscious throughout.

Thirdly, do any of you almost experience a weird sensation in your head? The best way I can explain it is almost like.. Electricity? It's only since I've been drinking coffee that I have experienced this. The last time I did was pre-medication before I was actually diagnosed with generalised Epilepsy.

Lastly, would any of these potentially cause a loss of drivers licence?

I'm coming up to my medical renewal and if any of these are signs of an impending seizure I'd like to take some sort of action if at all possible before that happens. If it's just the coffee then that's easy to fix. Please let me know your answers. ",5,1759284986.0,Epilepsy,4,0.86,False

You know how my phone always dies right when I need to look up a train time? I was literally doing that battery panic dance—closing every app, turning brightness to zero—just to get through the afternoon. It felt like I was rationing power like it was the last cookie in the jar.



I finally got so fed up I went digging for real tips, not just the usual ""turn off Bluetooth"" stuff. The most useful thing I did was stop charging my phone overnight. I read that lithium-ion batteries, like the one in my phone, actually get stressed if they're kept at 100% for hours on end. It's better for their long-term health to charge in shorter bursts.



So I started just plugging it in while I have my morning coffee and get ready. It usually gets to around 80-90%, which is more than enough for the day and puts less wear on the battery. It’s a tiny change, but my phone feels less like it's on life support by 5 PM. It’s honestly made waiting for the iPhone 17 a lot easier, knowing my current phone isn't completely falling apart.



It’s funny how a little curiosity about how batteries actually work can make such a difference. Now if I could only find a trick to stop myself from dropping it all the time.

1nuw0w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1nuw0w0/success_story_with_chocolate_chip_cookies_my_mind/,SUCCESS STORY with Chocolate Chip Cookies. MY MIND IS BLOWN.,"About 5-6 weeks ago I had watched a Youtube video suggesting a manifestation experiment to manifest being served a warm chocolate chip cooking. I did the SATs multiple times, really got into it, and let the universe take care of the rest. In the next two weeks I had a few instances where I noticed a gourmet chocolate chip. I took no action though because I wanted to be served this at my workplace. I kept affirming, did some more SATs and imagining.

As time went on I began to feel impatient. And I figured well I keep passing by these places that have these cookies. So why not take the action to reward myself with one?[ I made a post about this a little over 3 weeks ago asking if this counted as a success.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1nam4hg/does_this_count_as_a_success_story/) In case it's not showing, here it is:

>*I saw a video where a manifestion coach talked about manifesting something small like receiving a warm chocolate chip cookie. So I did the SATs and imagined. I imagined the warm cookie being served at my office kitchen. I imagined how sweet and warm it tasted. I even moved my arms, hands, and mouth as if I was eating the cookie. I'm sure I looked silly doing so but I live alone so whatever.*

>*After a few days pass by and still no cookies served at work. But I did stumble upon a cafe that I had never been to nearby my office. When I went into order a coffee and bagel, I noticed that they had warm chocolate chip cookies. But I didn't buy one because my manifestation was about receiving one, not buying it. I also thought about some harsh comments I received on this sub a few months ago when I asked about how to manifest my ex back after she dumped me. And how me taking action and texting her was mistrusting the process. It made me hesitant to take action to buy the cookie.*

>*After a few more days I began to get discouraged. I felt like it wasn't going to happen. As I was walking around the city on a lunch break, I passed by a fancy cafe where they had warm chocolate chip cookies. I decided that I didn't want to keep waiting, went in, ordered one to be warmed up in the oven, and took it with me. I ate it out on the street and it felt great.*

>*Now this is where I'm curious to whether this was the result of manifesting or not. I've seen contradictory statements in this community about taking action. Some will say you need to take action towards your manifestations. Other say taking action is a sign of mistrust and pushes it away. Technically I received the warm chocolate chip cookie by rewarding it to myself. It wasn't served at work but it was instead served by myself.*

>*This is where I begin to feel confused whether taking action is necessary or not. For example, let's say I want to manifest a bodybuilder physique. Many here would say it's already been done and that I simply just need to forget about it and let it show up in my life. Like I'm going to wake up one day with amazing muscles? Doesn't make sense to me. Yet in some other manifestations (like manifesting back an ex) we're taught to let it go and go about our lives and they will show up. Can someone clarify why taking action is bad in some manifestations, whereas in others it's acceptable?*

Anyway, I accepted that this was the manifestation of what I wanted. I was a little disappointed, but hey we're taught here that it can show up in ways that we didn't imagine or expected. I left it as is.

Then today (exactly 24 days later) a co worker had shown up today with a box of gourmet chocolate chip cookies. I was delighted and thought hey! Wait is this my actual manifestation? It must be. So I indulged myself with a deliciously expensive, warm, chocolate chip cookie sprinkled with sea salt. As I ate it, I thanked the God/Universe.

I did have an interaction earlier that day that really brought down my mood, so this definitely brought me back. As I was heading home, the negative feelings crept back up on me. By the time I was near my train stop I felt defeated and depressed. So I stopped by a local cafe that also serves alcohol. I helped myself to a drink while I chatted with the staff and a woman sitting next to me. As closing time came, the workers were moving large boxes. They opened them and asked us if we wanted leftover cookies from a previous event. These were gourmet chocolate chip cookies. I'm talking about the really expensive kind, maybe like $6-7 each. Large, perfect, sprinkled with sea salt. One of the workers asked if I wanted 10. I laughed because I thought he was joking. He wasn't. In fact, he even offered 20. I said I could take 15 because I'd feel too greedy. We all had a good laugh. He also gave me some leftover croissants too. I couldn't believe it. I had gotten my manifestation 15x fold!!!

So yeah my SATs from 5-6 weeks ago finally came true. The weird thing is I thought I had already manifested them 24 days ago. I barely thought about it afterward. Guess it wasn't actually manifested until today at work and receiving 15 free cookies, all in the same day. My mind is blown! SATs and imagining the feelings of end state do work!",28,1759284360.0,NevilleGoddard,6,1.0,False

also, my first post here, so if this breaks any of the rules in any way, I apologize.

Recently, I got a new job at an oil refinery. My life was packed into boxes and driven across the country to the small town of Throwman, California. Calling it a town is a compliment, at the end of the day. The one-street village came into view at around dawn, my eyes heavy with missed sleep, and my legs restless from the long drive. My truck kicked up dust behind me as my eyes scanned over what would become my new town. The light cast long shadows over the desolate collective, the tan and brown of the desert glinting off the warm sun. There were a few scattered buildings, all in serious need of repair, and emanating a time of care long since passed. After a bit of searching through old Sandy address posts and a long, painstakingly bumpy driveway, my new house was finally in front of me. It was a little bit more than a shack. The paint was peeling from the walls, old and faded. The windows were yellow, bleached from years in the sun. A long sigh escaped my lips as the heavy wooden door creaked open. My jaw tensed as I mentally prepared myself for what lay ahead. 

Inside, what greeted me was a cozy, albeit dingy, pre-furnished abode. The sofas and once colorful curtains gave off a scent of mildew, and the place was set up as if it hadn’t been touched since the 70’s. 

“I can work with this.”

 The thought stuck in my mind, my eyes scanning the dusty floors and the warm yellow light from the overhead xenon bulbs. My life was changing, and no one could have warned me by just how much.

A few days passed, getting adjusted to my new job and coming home to spend the waning sunlight hours doing all the repairs possible to my new derelict home. The Joshua trees seemed to stand as silent watchers around my property, looming and reaching angrily toward the sky. There had yet to be any visible activity on my way in and out, even though the article I read said that the town had a population of around 100 souls. The gas station on the main road, if you could call it that, was always empty, and the old wooden-board town hall building had no one ever around it. It was quiet, and I liked that. 

The next afternoon after work, I made the decision to stop by the town’s singular bar. The old door pulled open with a loud creak, the rusty hinges screaming as if they hadn’t been moved in years, and the rough metal handle was cold against my palm.  The room was dingy, almost silent, barely furnished save for a few old wooden tables and chairs and a ticking clock on the wall. There was a bar at the back, with a leathery-faced woman standing behind it. Her eyes regarded me with a mix of curiosity and suspicion, and she placed one of her gnarled hands on the polished wooden bartop.

“Y’must be the new neighbor.” 

She croaked out, her voice a raspy and gruff tone, matching her appearance.

“Sure am. Where is everyone?” 

My tone was curious and ignorant, and I stepped up to the bar counter, leaning an elbow on the hardwood.

“You mean the townsfolk? They’re about. Not much activity here, really.”

She responded, her gruff tone almost abrasive. She poured me a drink as she spoke, not bothering to ask me what I wanted. She sighed, leaning back against the counter behind her.

“Best not to ask too many questions. People don’t like that around here.”

She croaked, her eyes not leaving me as the shot glass came to my lips and back down again. Suspicion poured from her body language, and her words formed a small pit in my stomach, quelled by the burning liquor following it. 

“Understood.. Appreciate it.” 

My voice was unsure, not knowing how to proceed. A chill ran down my spine, and I pressed a bill onto the counter, then turned to leave. The woman said nothing, but I felt her eyes boring holes into my back as the heavy door clicked shut behind me.

There was a small, dusty bulletin board on the outside paneling of the bar, which had gone unnoticed on my way in. It held years of advertising for vehicle sales, different events which had long since passed, and what caught my eye were two missing persons posters in the bottom corner. It seemed that there were a few flyers stacked on top of each other, in two pinned stacks. The pages seemed to yellow and crumple more and more the further back they went, until one of the papers turned to dust in my hands. The front pages looked relatively new, and they held the pictures of what seemed to be a couple. The names read, “Gary Duncan,” and “Danielle Duncan,” along with descriptions of height and weight, and last known whereabouts. The frozen faces of the people in the photos looked aged, and the flyers confirmed that they were both in their mid-sixties.

 My mind started to wander, wondering if they had maybe just skipped town, or if someone had found them already. I shook my head with returning focus and stepped back towards my truck. My house was starting to look decently livable at this point, and by the time I arrived back, the sun was just heaving its last rays of light over the desert landscape. The burgeoning stars stared down at me, their twinkling light not nearly as comforting as it used to be. 

This night is when it started. It was around midnight, and it was way past the time I should’ve been in bed already. Outside my window, over the soft sound of the TV playing in the living room, there was what seemed to be a distant thud, followed by a quick burst of laughter that made my gut flip upside down. I quickly shut off the TV and raced to the back window to investigate. Even with the back porch light on, the darkness of the desert was suffocating, the shadows of the tall Joshua trees ever-present and ever-looming. There was nothing, not a glint of light or any movement beyond the swaying bushes and underbrush from the cold night wind. I dismissed it and called myself crazy for psyching myself out enough to believe that anyone was out there, much less giggling like a maniac in my backyard. Sleep came generally easily, but I couldn’t shake the uneasiness the whole day had laid over me like a thick wool blanket.

The next night, at around the same time, I heard it again. Fear formed in my stomach, an iron knot that grated against my sense of rationality. This time, my flashlight came with me and met the bone-chilling night wind as I quickly navigated to the edge of my property. Nothing. Absolutely nothing, other than the quiet scraping of the foliage and the occasional hoot from an owl. Right as I was calling myself crazy again, and turning to head back into the house, my flashlight swept over a very faint, illuminated red dot in the distance. This sent me racing back into the house, slamming my back door closed and pulling the deadbolt tight behind me with a satisfying click. What WAS that? There was nobody out there in that cold; there couldn’t be. The noises, the laughing, the light, it could all be coincidental, I convinced myself. Every window and door was locked, with me double-checking before shutting off the lights, and tucking myself in to sleep. 

  
Morning came, and the harsh desert sun quickly breathed stale heat onto the landscape. I scanned my front porch, coffee mug in my hand. The events of the night before flashed through my mind as I searched the edge of my property. Sighing, I realized after my boot left a wet crunch ring through my ears that I had stepped in something. Looking down, I saw the desiccated corpse of a jackrabbit, pale fur stained a brownish-red with dried blood. Bile rose in my throat as I stumbled backwards, grunting. It seemed as if the rabbit had been torn to shreds, entrails splayed and destroyed beyond recognition.   
  
  
  
After I finished losing my breakfast, I spent the rest of the morning cleaning the macabre scene. The rabbit’s skin had been sliced clean through, a cut obviously made with a sharp razor, and not an animal’s tooth. This observation raised many concerns, especially in relation to the night before. I decided that now was the time to start socializing and figuring out just what was happening here in Throwman. Otherwise, whatever was going on would decide to really find out what was happening with me personally.  
  
  
  
Steeling myself, my booted foot clicked heavily onto the stark white tiling of the town hall floor. Tonight was Saturday night, and I had noticed a swell of individuals entering the building on my way in. The yellowish hue of the light from the faded plastic fixtures brought a somber feeling to the room. Chairs were arranged in straight lines, facing a podium at the front of the room. People milled about, claiming seats and having hushed conversations. There was something odd about the faces of the residents of Throwman. As my eyes swept over the townsfolk, I couldn’t help but notice how off they were. Some had very yellowish eyes, maybe a trick of the light, some’s teeth seemed just a bit too sharp for my liking. A strange sense of being studied filled me as eyes locked onto the newcomer. I did my best to stay unnoticed during the meeting, listening to old, golden-eyed desert rats yammer about the state of their crops and livestock.  
  
  
  
The door closed behind me with a hearty click. The night was harshly cool, the breeze stinging my cheeks and nose. I felt the stares of the various townsfolk against my back as I seated myself in my truck. Nothing was spoken to me at all, not a greeting uttered. As if I were just another wanderer there to ruin the peace. Everything else over the past week had me feeling as if it went a bit deeper than that, though.  
  
  
  
I came to the end of my worn-out driveway, a subtle melancholy held in my gut. The engine of the truck cut off, and the lock chimed its normal beep. I paused for a moment as I was turning the handle of the door. Unlocked. Had I locked it? The thought didn’t have enough time to register in my head before the heavy screen door knocked me down my porch steps.   
  
  
  
I looked up at my assailant, the fine dirt scraping into the skin of my hands. Two fully grown coyotes seemed to lunge past me, fur matted and mouths agape with razor-like fangs.. I craned my neck quickly, trying to follow with my eyes, but by the time my head turned enough to see, the coyotes had vanished into the oppressive darkness just outside the boundary of the porch light. My bleeding palm met the stippled plastic handle of my handgun. Anger started to flow through me, as whatever these people wanted had now gone from some weird hazing shit to a genuine threat.  
  
  
  
After a few seemingly pointless minutes of making sure nobody was actually in my house still, a few things stuck out to me. The screen door was cut clean through the middle. A faint smell of sulphur stinging the back of my throat. I decided to pick up the phone and call through the landline to the police to try to end this.

I like a cafe with a lingering cigarette smell mixing with coffee, maple, and bacon… maybe I’m just nostalgic… or old. Likely both. 

Anyway, I’d really like to find someone that I’m compatible with on a deep and meaningful level; I’m very communicative and really like to understand my partners and friends, and for them to understand me. If you don’t really know yourself or are uncomfortable with emotional/tough questions, I may not be the one for you. 

About me: 
I’m a homebody, cat owner, agnostic, and child free. Having my own children was something I was never really interested in, and would prefer a guy that’s of a similar mindset. I am the “cool aunt” and much prefer that lifestyle. I’m pretty funny and easy to get along with, or I at least think so. Perhaps I’m a bit picky, but aren’t we all? 

I am introverted, but have no issues being out in social settings/groups. I do get overwhelmed a bit with huge crowds (think arena concerts) but am not in that situation often. If Myers Briggs is your thing, I’m an INFJ. If it’s zodiac, I’m a Virgo. Essentially I’m pretty quiet and observant until I know someone. I’m organized and fairly logically, but emotionally deep under that. I work full time remotely from home, been with this company for 9 years now and promoted multiple times. I have a Master’s degree specializing in my field of work. 

Hobbies:
I love to read and book shop (these are 2 different things, iykyk), do crafty type hobbies, cook, and tend to my plants/small garden. I go to the gym 5x per week for cardio and strength training (working on body recomp). I also do hot yoga and Pilates on the weekend. 

Physical:
I’m 6’1, currently a size 18 (plus size), mid length auburn hair (just past my collarbones, currently growing out), blue eyes, pale skin. I am very serious about health goals and working towards body recomp and general strength training. It’s important to note I will always have a curvier body, I like that about me, but I’m also just a bigger framed person. I am not interested in being smaller than a size 12 ever. If that’s not something you’re okay with, we are not a match.

As this falls under “physical” (imo), I am a physically affectionate person (and high libido) while in a relationship, if you are not, we will not work. This is a non negotiable.

Location: 
It would be cool to find someone within the central Texas area (San Antonio/Austin), but I’m open to long distance as I work remotely, and I’m also willing (and ready) to leave Texas. It’s something I’m already considering just doing solo and my current brain dump has me considering Utah/Idaho/Wyoming or PNW, but also possibly the Wisconsin or Michigan area. 

Looking for:
Looking within the age range of 34-50, I am only interested in monogamy. I would like to find someone my height (6’1) or taller, but it’s not a dealbreaker for me. I may be a gym rat, but that is not something I expect from a partner. However, being healthy or at least looking after your health and being able to occasionally going for a walk with me is important. I don’t mind going to the gym together, but like to do my own thing while there.

Consideration, consistency, and communication are top of the list for me in terms of what I’m looking for in a man. I also seem to get along best with men whose love language is acts of service. I am looking for someone that has a good head on their shoulders, I have my life together, you should as well. There is no purpose in partnering together if we cannot enhance each other’s lives. With that being said, I really want to find someone fun, lighthearted, knows when to be serious, can banter with me and can balance the perfect roast:worship ratio. Basically the needle in a haystack.

So, what’s your favorite breakfast food?",6,1759284079.0,cf4cf,0,0.88,False

You know how I used to be a slave to every coffee shop power outlet? My phone battery anxiety was a real, palpable thing, a low hum of dread by 3 PM.



It’s funny how a tiny red battery icon can dictate your entire day. I finally reached a breaking point, and that’s when I started looking into the iPhone 17. The shift has been quiet but profound. I’m no longer mapping my errands around charging spots, and that’s a freedom I didn’t realize I was missing.



The real game-changer, I read, isn't just a bigger battery but a smarter chip that manages power per app. It’s like having a tiny, hyper-efficient concierge inside your phone, deciding who gets the energy and when. Who knew a phone could learn to be so frugal?



Now, I can actually forget to charge it overnight, wake up to a still-respectable 30%, and know it’ll get me to lunch without a panic. It just… works. It feels less like a high-tech gadget and more like a reliable, well, tool. And honestly, that’s the whole point, isn’t it?

1nuvth3,https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonemployees/comments/1nuvth3/intern_feeling_blocked_isolated_and_not_sure_if_i/,"Intern feeling blocked, isolated, and not sure if I should stay","Hi all,

I’m a few months into an internship, and it’s been rough. On paper it looks great - Amazon name / supposed big projects. In reality my deliverables are vague and mostly admin-style tasks. One is on hold due to technical issues I can’t fix, and the other is repetitive work with no real learning. I get handed massive messy datasets with impossible deadlines and little direction, and then get told my outputs “aren’t clear,” even though the context was missing in the first place.

What stings is seeing other interns (same role, even 3-month ones) working on meaningful AI projects. I’ve been pushing since day one to work on AI. I’ve even built prototypes tied to real business problems but every suggestion gets shut down with “just focus on your deliverables.” L7/8s encourage me to “work with your manager” to get opportunities, but in practice I’m kept boxed in.

Another big frustration is being tracked constantly. I make the effort to be in the office every day, but if I’m not visible for even a short time, it gets noticed and raised. It feels like I’m under a microscope while at the same time being excluded from anything meaningful. Socially it’s isolating too, I’m rarely included, never invited to lunches, and often eat alone. Other interns I know in the same org don’t seem to deal with this.

I’ve tried to make the most of it: coffee chats in other departments, mentoring, upskilling on my own. But within my team I feel under-used and undervalued. I came here wanting to raise the bar, contribute, and learn. Instead I feel like an extra pair of hands for admin. My biggest worry is finishing this year and having nothing concrete to point to when a hiring manager asks: “what did you actually do at Amazon?”

So my question: is this normal? Do interns usually get sidelined like this in Amazon/Big Tech, and I just need to grit my teeth for the CV line? Or is this a sign I should think about cutting my losses before wasting a year?

Any advice would help.

I was recently searching for a local AP. I had ads posted on the affair subreddit and AM. I found several incredible pAPs. Weeding the final contenders was difficult. 
I finally chose a pAP with a mutual strong connection, commonalities, and attraction. We met up for coffee and the chemistry was 🔥🔥. The only red flag 🚩 was the communication was not as frequent as I wanted. We had a hotel meetup and it was amazing but after they became a bit distant. 

I decided to continue with my search. During my search, I came across someone looking for an OA. I was not interested in an OA but this person just connected on so many levels. We continued talking and in the meantime, I met someone again on AM. This pAP made it clear they were looking for a NSA situation(an affair Virgin) . I informed them I was not interested in a NSA but we kept talking. After talking for a bit, I began to develop feelings. 
At this time, I am continuing with my OA (stick with me). My OA is supportive, caring, attentive, understanding, and hot as hell! Now, another player is brought into play, they are kind, considerate, attentive, sexy, good looking and LOCAL. Everything is great with them! Passion, chemistry, and connection, all boxes check. 
So here I am juggling APs. Of course, my OA doesn't expect exclusivity but it coming to see me in December. 
My AP is good but every so often something feels off. Just a little blip. Remember they are an affair virgin. 
Meanwhile, my first pAP, who we had chemistry and amazing sex but kinda disappeared starts chatting. Says they had been super busy with their company and marriage issues. We keep talking but I want to keep them around because in case something doesn't work out between me and the new local AP. I mean the sex was amazing! Am I the only one playing nefarious games?

* **Coffeed (East Village):** This café goes all out for Halloween with creepy decorations, pumpkins, and themed drinks like pumpkin spice lattes. My favorite thing to eat there is the croissant sandwich with ham and cheese, honestly, one of the most delicious I’ve ever had.
* **Black Cat Café (Lower East Side):** A tiny, moody spot with a dark vibe. They have fun drinks like black lattes and dark chocolate mochas, and I love it because the food is really good.
* **Alice’s Tea Cup (Multiple locations, Upper East Side & Midtown):** Not exactly a haunted café, but during Halloween they add seasonal touches  pumpkin desserts, Halloween teas, and cute spooky décor. This is one of my favorites to go read and take Instagram photos  definitely the most Instagrammable one.
* **Lella Alimentari (Brooklyn):** Great coffee and pastries, and in October they decorate with cobwebs, pumpkins, and candles. It’s my favorite for a chill vibe because it’s the quietest of all the spots.

**Tip:** Many cafés in NYC add Halloween specials only in October, so it’s best to check Instagram or their websites before going. Weekends can get busy, so early mornings are ideal if you want photos without crowds.

Hopping between these cafés was a fun way for me to enjoy Halloween without spending a fortune on events or parties.

1nuvisk,https://www.reddit.com/r/usyd/comments/1nuvisk/applying_to_officeworks_was_one_of_the_most/,Applying to officeworks was one of the most humiliating things I've done,"What this has to do with usyd?? Well, if someone asks me to get coffee or milk tea to hang out (which hasn't happened yet but IF!!!1!!1) on some days I might actually have to say no because I am that broke. Also I'm still wearing the clothes my parents bought for me from when I was 12 since I stopped growing from then and I fear it has made me more self conscious and made me less likely to talk to people. I could ask my parents for money but it's just really embarrassing since I haven't done so when I had a job but now I've used up all my money on coffee and energy drinks and soda and the opal transport fees are kinda expensive even with the concession card.

All I wanted was a casual job that wasn't in fast food cuz I wanna lose weight and looking at the food won't help and if someone messes up they might offer u the food and I WILL succumb one day and also I've had kinda bad experiences with my previous stints there, my previous manager crashed out because I rolled my eyes at her ONCE and we kinda got into a fight and so I left since I had to walk like 20 mins to my job and they kept cancelling or shortening my shifts anyways. 

So I remembered officeworks and thought I should apply there, it's a bit more of a pain to get there but whatever I don't mind as long as they stop shortening my shifts and HOLY SHIT the process is so tedious!!! So they make you send a resume (mandatory) and then make you manually fill in the details that you already gave in your resume which is annoying but already standard so whatevs, that paled in comparison to what happened next. They make you take 7 mini actual full-time work interview type questions for a CASUAL TEMPORARY JOB that each have a maximum of 3 minutes each and prep time of 30 seconds AND you have to see your ugly mug while speaking because they require camera for some reason(?? it's a casual job clam down) and there was even some bullshit abt what to wear in the intro video when recording but I wore my pjs cuz I'm sigma joker Patrick bateman like that. One of the questions was something like ""what was the greatest accomplishment in your previous job"" and wtf am I supposed to say?? This is the same job that previously asked for a parental/guardian signature if I wasnt 18 to show that I'm allowed to work btw. The questions were all bullshit corporate-ass questions suited for actual jobs, one of em even asked me to pitch a random product like cmon dude it's a casual job WHO CARES and when I'm done, I never actually got to 3 minutes but idk what else I was supposed to say, the thumbnails of the videos of me answering the questions would always show me in the most diabolical unflattering positions as well to add insult to injury, which is kinda crazy since I watched one of the videos and I wasn't THAT bad looking. Istg the ai picking the videos is specifically programmed to make you feel worse about yourself and I suspect the purpose of the whole interview is also for that reason, there's more proof later!!! 

So after those questions you think you would be done right??? WRONG. They also make you play some minigames for which I can only assume that they are checking to see if you have some mental deficiency, or they believe in eugenics, or probably both actually because officeworks is EVIL and hates you. One of the math minigames was basically impossible without a calculator so I used my phone cuz I don't remember anything specifically saying it wasn't allowed but then what was the point of the easier questions??? The other minigame was like those IQ tests, it wasn't fun :(

After the application process, they see that you haven't demeaned yourself enough and so they send you an email negging you. It turns out that for better or for worse, they dont actually watch you speak, they have an ai transcribe what you say (why did I have to record myself then?? It must be because they want me to think I'm ugly) and then have an ai give you ""insights"" and they probably just have an automatic prompter that tells chatgpt or mscopilot to say one good thing then 3 negative things about you but to semi-disguise the founders' disgust at the peasants into """"""""""""constructive criticism"""""""""""". Forget the saying that God is an abusive boyfriend, OFFICEWORKS IS THE ABUSIVE BOYFRIEND!!! It compliments you and the next seconds turns around and demeans you to see you squirm in embarrassment but the sweet sweet discounted stationary and offers of any employment and money at all make you stay and put up with it. The baby is me. The child is my pride. 

Worst of all, I spent like an hour total on the application and I probably won't get even hired because the times available I put are low since I've got exams and usyd hasn't released the dates of those exams. Also they might see this post idk but it's like a 50 minute walk (30mins public transport, 10 mins car) so idrc tbh. I just wanted money. Instead I got got robbed of my time, dignity and very personhood. I panicked and gave some cherished memories as answers to some interview questions along with my genuine hobbies and now they are tainted. 

A.N. 
I wanted to express further disgust for the interview questions since I didn't express it in full but idk how and writing is hard

1nuvgnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1nuvgnx/the_stranger_who_shared_my_coffee/,The Stranger Who Shared My Coffee,"I was running late that morning, rushing with my half-finished coffee in hand, when I bumped into someone at the café door. My cup almost slipped, but her hand shot out, steadying mine before it spilled everywhere.  She laughed, a quick, soft laugh. “Guess I just saved us both from smelling like caramel latte all day.”

I smiled back, grateful and a little caught off guard. She had this quiet warmth about her, like she’d walked straight out of a memory I didn’t know I had.

Inside, the place was crowded, only one table left by the window. I hesitated, but she nodded at it. “Want to share?”

We sat down, and what started as casual small talk about coffee, the weather, the chaos of mornings turned into a conversation that felt too easy, too natural. She told me about the city she’d just moved from, how she hated unpacking, how she always carried a notebook but never finished a single story in it.

I told her about my job, my favorite books, the dream I had of traveling but never quite chasing. It was one of those conversations that makes you forget time is moving.

Then her phone buzzed. She glanced at it, face softening with an apology. “I have to go.”

I wanted to ask her name, her number, anything but instead, I just nodded. She smiled one more time, gathered her notebook, and left with a quick wave.

I sat there for a long while, staring at the half-empty coffee cups between us.  I’ve gone back to that café every morning since. Sometimes I even order the same drink, hoping she’ll walk in again.

She hasn’t. But every time I see someone with a notebook, I look twice just in case.",2,1759282768.0,story,0,1.0,False

I asked and respected everything I didn't do anything bad, I was polite, asked to hold her hand, brought a jacket to mass for her, did thr sidewalk rule.

1nuvcix,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nuvcix/aio_boss_keeps_making_weird_comments_about_my/,AIO? Boss keeps making weird comments about my weight,"To make a long story short, I’m not the skinniest person out there. I was on a medication that made me pack on the pounds pretty quickly, and I admittedly had some not-great eating habits. I was around 230 a year ago, but I’ve brought my weight down to 195, a still not-great size but to a point where my old clothes from storage fit again. I’m still trying to keep the momentum going though, and would like to bring my weight down to at least 160.

For clarification, I work at a small airport about a mile from my house. I usually walk to/from work, but on the rare occasion that I’m running late, I’ll pay the $4 or whatever for a Lyft. I work as a cashier for one of the convenience stores built into the airport, and there are 2 stores in the airport: one outside of TSA, and one upstairs past TSA.

The manager in question(I’ll call her Jane) is notorious for being an overall unlikeable person. She is an older woman who is often bitter and stubborn, and tends to make passive aggressive remarks. In the past, I used to have the luxury of working opposite shifts so I’d be coming in just as she was leaving.

The first incident this happened, Jane was having me work downstairs, but needed me to come upstairs to grab a cash drawer for my register(the safe room is upstairs). As I’m coming in, she’s demanding that the store downstairs be open right then and there, which is odd because usually I have a 30 minute window before I need to open(it gives me time to grab my till, turn on the coffee machines, and get the store ready for opening). But okay, fine, I’ll do it. Isn’t worth a fight.

Often what I would do is, I would buy food from the upstairs store and bring it down with me, because the food options downstairs are considerably limited compared to the upstairs store. Most of the managers didn’t care, but Jane was on a warpath that day and was yelling “no, I don’t care what the other managers tell you, they’re not here right now, I am, so you listen to what I say” etc. The way she was getting worked up, you’d thought I’d asked to use the bathroom immediately after clocking in.

So I said “If I can’t buy my food before going downstairs, can I grab what I’m getting now and then pay for it downstairs?” while holding up my wallet. She rolls her eyes and says fine.

So I grab my things(see photo), along with a monster for one of the workers downstairs(she likes the pipeline punch monsters and we don’t sell them downstairs, so I’ll often grab one and bring it down for her)and bring it all to the till.

She decides to loudly say “WOW, YOU MUST BE HUNGRY TODAY HUH” and starts COUNTING THE BLOODY CALORIES ON EVERYTHING IM BUYING as she’s scanning them.

I told her it was my only meal for the day, since I tend to graze throughout the day, and she drops it thank god, but it sat with me weird for months. Then some other shit came up at work 2 days ago.

I was working the register upstairs when I realized, I hadn’t eaten anything. My aunt had started an intermittent fasting diet and I was doing it in support of her, but walking a mile to work + not eating until 12 = shaky, jittery, and uneasy hungry feeling. I have a strong fear of vomiting, and was scared I’d made myself nauseous from running on fumes. So I’d asked my assistant manager A if I could buy something like a protein bar or a blueberry muffin. I explained that I was on a diet but I was feeling sick and that I needed to get some food into my system so I could take my meds.

Cue in my shift manager Judy butting in, saying “you know, I would have figured you’d be losing so much weight, with you walking back and forth from work, but your problem is all the damn food you’re making. That’s why you aren’t losing weight.”

Excuse me?????

(For context, I graduated a beginner level culinary arts class and studied under a 3 star Michelin chef. It helped me discover a love for cooking and baking, and often I’ll go into work showing my coworkers pictures of some of the things I’ll make for fun. I’ve even brought in a few baked goods on certain occasions.)

I was taken aback and A didn’t say anything (not sure if she was paying attention) but it made me feel so uncomfortable. I’ve always been a bit insecure about my physique and I’ve made an effort to improve, but I didn’t really appreciate having something like that pointed out by someone I barely know. I spoke to another manager and she said she would handle it, but I don’t know if I should have just let it go. Am I overreacting here?",1,1759282445.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False
1nuvaek,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1nuvaek/32m_divorced_in_a_messed_up_relationship_dynamics/,32M divorced in a messed up relationship dynamics,"I am a 32M who finalized my divorce this year, though I've been separated since 2023. I moved overseas and now occupy a common room in a co-living flat.

One of my flatmates is a 28F unmarried female nurse. She is in a relationship with another male flatmate who is married, with a wife and two young children back in India.

Now, here comes the messy part—if it wasn't already. The female flatmate asked me out for coffee. I obliged as a friendly gesture, but I soon got sucked in and started liking her. It reached a point where every time I heard a noise from the kitchen, my mind would tell me to go meet her. I'd end up staying in the kitchen just to talk to her whenever she was there. I couldn't control the impulse. Soon, it became an obsession, and I'd think every notification on my phone was from her.

We started spending time together outside the flat—going to the temple, hiking, and holding hands on walks in the park. I felt we had a real connection. However, one day her partner saw us in the park, and she flipped. She stopped going out with me after that. But I, like a fool, thought if I tried harder, she might choose me.

That's when my downfall began. I started daydreaming in the office about what our life would be like if she accepted me. I couldn't focus on work and began procrastinating on all my tasks.

I started making her overnight oats, avocado shakes, and brownies, even feeding her with a spoon like we were a couple. She liked the care and attention I gave without having to make any real commitment, and this fueled my ""giver"" energy. She began calling me every day after lunch for a chat, and I loved it.

To be clear, she has maintained boundaries; she never entered my room and isn't flirty with me.

I used to literally run home from the office early to make dinner for her, hoping it would be ready before she got back. This ""giver energy"" was my way of showing I cared—exactly what I did for my ex-wife. Ah, the same old pattern repeating itself.

But every time I heard her laugh with her partner, jealousy kicked in. I'd wonder if they were being intimate at night. The pain was unbearable. Seeing them go out on date nights didn't help.

I never made a move, fearing she would back off and I'd lose the so-called friendship we had.

But something recently changed. I took a hard right and went totally ""no contact,"" going silent. No more breakfast for her, no more please-tries.

She noticed the change and started reaching out on WhatsApp, even opening my room door to check on me. I've started wearing headphones in the kitchen to show I'm not available to talk. She want me to sit at the dining table and talk to her but I would give some excuse and have my breakfast in my room. She keeps reaching out and wants the old me back. I clearly told her that's not possible but seems she think she can reel me back in. 

I like the attention she giving now. She doing exactly what I used to do for her. 

Based on all this, what do you think this woman wants from me?

Is it just the care and attention I gave her, or something more serious? Or does she want to keep me around as a backup option—someone who's always available to take care of her?

She told me her current relationship is temporary, as she plans to move to New Zealand next year.

I plan to move out of this house as soon as possible to find some peace of mind, as the situation is emotionally draining. The loop of giver energy -> satisfaction -> jealously -> pain seems never ending. 
A part of me wants her, but she is not emotionally available now. Then the question of ethics and morality kicks in: if she's involved with a married man now , would she even be the right partner for me who wants to date to marry. No casual hookups. ",5,1759282281.0,limerence,8,1.0,False

Im caffeine-naive and have no tolerance, but i wanted to experience something memorable, and that would help me complete tasks i had been procrastinating on. 

10-20 minutes: I felt nothing besides feeling a little bit hot
30 minutes: I started doing my online school work and I was able to complete 2 important tests! By this time, I started feeling the urge to get up and walk around,  I was so uncomfortable sitting, and starting to feel hot. 
40 minutes: this is when it started actually kicking in, I wanted to clean my closet since it had gotten pretty messy, and I was able to fold clothes, and organize things, all in 10 minutes. By this time I felt very physically hot and began to feel the sensation of my teeth-chattering when it's cold except it was my arms and legs that felt super ""chattery"" if you will, I was moving quickly, my heart rate was up from 60bpm to 90bpm and I could feel my head and throat having a slight heartbeat too. I felt wired, and it was almost a little overwhelming and I became super fast and jittery but not uncomfortably so.
50 minutes: I decided to put the energy to use and went out for a run, by this time I was absolutely caffeinated, my entire body was buzzing, I was talking fast and moving hyper, and the second I got out, I immediately started running super quickly and it felt like I was on fire! I ran about 4mph in 2-3 minutes and my heart rate was around 140bpm and I felt energized and like i could handle any other excercise I wanted. I ran all around my apartment complex and I even ran downhill too, I had to stop eventually. And then I just kept running in short bursts, I could feel energy burning and the same jittery/chattery feeling. I kept on walking quickly without any breaks and my heart rate was still high but no true tiredness/fatigue happened even once i got back, it's like I was just more powerful and energetic and immune to the usual tiredness and aches that happen after I run or workout, plus my breath control was wayyyyy better. 
1h and 20 minutes: my thoughts glowed freely when I was talking and I didn't have to pause and think about anything when I was talking, words and ideas just flowed perfectly fine and I still wasn't tired. 
2-3 hours: I'm back to normal, no fatigue, I ate lunch, and im fine now. Safe to say I'll be doing this again! Im usually pretty mellow and not too happy/sad/angry so being so hyped up like that was crazy. 

9/10. Would Recommend 
I might just do 300mg tomorrow.
And for reference, I'm 5'4, 135lbs and 16, so that's the effect that coffee had on someone my size.

Sx1

Ax1

Bx12

* It's a very unique opening. I'll give it that.
* What a shocking case
* Dougnix is underrated
* It sure is an opening song
* Some parts are a bit off-putting but really nice in others

Cx7

* It's just a prologue theme. They never make an impression on me.

Dx1

# Courtroom Lobby ~ Neverending Overture/Defendant Lobby ~ So It Will Always Begin: B+ [4.5909]

Sx2

Ax9

* Serious and grandiose, perfect for Mia and Grossberg.
* Favorite lobby theme, only beaten by AJ's one.
* Ok, shit gets serious now (frfr)

Bx11

* It's good, but I'm not as big a fan of it as any of the other lobby themes.
* conveys the heavy theme of the game pretty nicely

# Trial/Court is Now in Session: A+ [5.5]

Sx12

* This music screams ""finale."" It's so fitting to ""Trials & Tribulations,"" the last game in the Phoenix Wright trilogy.
* Again, 2nd favorite court theme and I love this leitmotif being in the credits.
* These must be my tears
* Forever immortalised because of that last case, but is still fantastic without it.
* PEAAAAK. This is the best trial theme in all of Ace Attorney. Absolutely perfect.

Ax9

* I really like how this is a throwback to the first trial theme with the chords in the same rhythm, but this time feels a lot darker (and there’s less space between the chords)
* I love the variation in the music
* sounded amazing and cathartic after 3-5

Bx1

# Questioning/Cross-Examination ~ Moderato 2004: B [4.2273]

Sx1

Ax5

* The c-e themes grow better every game
* i love how final this sounds, like you have to solve this right now or something bad will happen. i can't really describe it, but it's similar to the vibe of SOJ's one

Bx15

* Bit of a weird cross-examination theme, but somehow it works
* It's okay, but I prefer the allegro version. Now that one slaps.
* This one feels a bit by the numbers 
* It's pretty good. I don't like it as much as the previous two games' Moderato themes though.

Dx1

# Phoenix Wright ~ Objection! 2004: A [4.7727]

Sx7

* Once again, I love that the leitmotif of this theme became Phoenix's prevalent character theme.
* So good it returned in DD
* This clean.
* top tier, but it sounds a bit TOO peaceful for an objection theme

Ax4

* I'm not sure why this became Phoenix' standard ""Objection"" theme as opposed to the one from the first game, but it is a bop.

Bx10

* Doesn't hit as hard as it should, blossoms only in further iterations.
* Personally I don’t quite like it as much compared to PW and JFA as it’s too staccato
* I think this one gets improved with later versions. Still a bop though.

Cx1

# Questioning/Cross-Examination ~ Allegro 2004: A [5.1364]

Sx9

* ONE OF THE BEST ALLEGRO THEMES EVER IT GOES SO HARD I can't stop myself from jamming when I hear it in game
* Dahlia with naughty face >:D
* Best allegro song in the series.

Ax7

* Ahh, the urgency in this track!
* The second section of this one is super danceable and also feels anticipatory 
* How does the Allegro improve this one so much? It sounds so much more intense.

Bx6

# Pressing Pursuit ~ Caught/Pursuit ~ Catch the Culprit: A [4.8636]

Sx7

* Listen to the GBA version. Then, you will know why it’s S.
* This is one of my favourite pursuit themes. Firstly, I like how the melody starts with 4-bar sections and then shortens to 3-bar ones - it feels very climactic to follow, like it is running away from me. The intro is also especially intense and loops really well
* all pursuit themes are top tier imo, but i feel like it's limited by the fact that it's not orchestrated (more so than the other themes)

Ax6

* An underrated ""Pursuit"" theme. It's very good.
* It's great but I prefer JFA pursuit 
* They can't surpass Cornered yet
* Super hype, really good pursuit theme

Bx8

* This one is underrated. I feel like the GBA and DS soundfonts don't do it justice though. That one guitar version they always used in the trailers sounds amazing though.

Cx1

# Telling the Truth/The Truth Revealed 2004: B+ [4.5909]

Sx4

* Now this song just perfectly encapsulates courtroom chaos. I often remember this song before the pursuit theme.
* This is one of my favorites, especially the the part that starts descending faster and faster is just so dramatic.

Ax7

* Really puts you into the mind of a cornered liar.
* Godot spit
* The faster tell the truth themes are more slay and this is no exception, although I prefer Apollo justice’s 
* sounds weirdly suspenseful, i like it

Bx9

* Bass line is really cool, alright otherwise

Cx2

* Coming off of the best Telling the Truth theme in JFA, this one is just... not that good by comparison. It's too repetitive and it's not as powerful as its counterparts. It's not bad, but still.

# Pressing Pursuit ~ Caught/Pursuit ~ Catch the Culprit (Variation): A [4.9091]

Sx7

Ax7

* Same as earlier. 
* Slightly worse as they removed the intro :(
* Isn't this the same as the other one lol?

Bx7

Cx1

# Victory! ~ Endless Victory/An Eternal Win: B+ [4.2727]

Sx2Ax6

* Gumshoe's weenies
* This one's very good. Not much to say otherwise, but it's suitably happy after all the trials and tribulations we went through.

Bx10

* My favorite victory theme
* I dunno, this theme is kinda too light for me.
* There’s a lot of victory themes that sound similar trying to be the best victory theme, and this one just wasnt good enough to be above a B for me

Cx4

* Simple and sweet

# Jingle ~ Can’t Go Back to a Normal Life/There’s No Going Back: C+ [3.5]

Sx1

Ax4

Bx4

* Eh. First game jingle is still the best.
* It's the least interesting jingle in the series tbh

Cx11

* This feels to complex

Dx1

Fx1

# The Stolen Turnabout: B [3.8636]

Sx3

Ax3

* Best intro
* Strangely memorable intro, kind of Mario adjacent

Bx8

* It starts out alright, then gets elevated when Mask DeMasque's theme kicks in!
* Again, prologue theme, doe this one is a bit better so I can give it more credit.
* I like this one. Starts off normal enough and then Mask☆DeMasque steals the show.
* Okay I was tricked in the first half lmaooo, I love the second half

Cx6

Dx1

Fx1

# Investigation ~ Opening/Initial Investigation 2004: B [4.1364]

Sx4

* Another theme I am often jammin to when I play and one of my favorite investigation songs.
* This really stood out to me on first hearing it, so I gave it an S. in particular, it’s really satisfying when the synth and bass sound combine in the second section 
* Aka the best initial investigation theme in the trilogy AKA that song I spent 20 minutes on in stolen turnabout.

Ax2

* It's not your fault, Adrian. That urn is cursed 🥺

Bx10

* Pretty standard investigation opening. I can't really say whether I like it more than the previous games.

Cx5

Dx1

# Detention Center ~ Prisoner’s Elegy: B+ [4.6364]

Sx6

* For how rarely it plays, I love this especially when Iris is in the jail. It works perfectly for her, I often associate this theme with her.
* Best Detention Center so far, empty and sad.
* This is the best detention song.
* The best detencion center music in all the series, so simple and yet elegant and melancholic.
* THEY MADE IT EVEN SADDER?! Honestly though, I really love this one. I also like how only plays in the last case. It makes it more impactful.

Ax5

* The second section with the bells helps to tie it together with the other sad themes and I think that’s clever
* it's a lot sadder than the other dc themes, which fits 3-5 and iris perfectly

Bx8

* Simple but really effective

Cx3

* Did they really have to go this sad for the detention center theme? lol

# Lordly Tailor: B [3.9545]

Sx2

* Adrian is back!!!!!

Ax4

* Idk why but this theme is so funny to me. It's just a department store but MMM YES VERILY THE SQUIRE HATH ARRIVETH
* Little did they know that this place was about to be robbed.
* I might be this song's number 1 fan. It's such a vibe. I remember the first time I played this game, this song got me pumped to investigate with the boys again.

Bx8

* Nice little happy tune, but it doesn't particularly stick out.
* I think this one’s really well arranged and layered instrumentally, but I can’t help but find it a bit derivative. 
* surprisingly catchy

Cx7

Dx1

# Mask☆deMasque ~ Pleeeeease Listen!/Please Listen to Meeeee!: A [4.9545]

Sx7

* Ron gets pegged by Desirée 
* HOLD UP! His song is this fire!?
* Absolute banger. The Phantom Thieves of Heart wish they had music this good /j
* \- At least there's none of the weird stuff, I love this theme with my heart and soul

Ax9

* PLEEEEEEEASE LET THIS GET A HIGH RAAAAAAANKIIIIIIIIIING! (Ron DeLite, my beloved.)
* I love the instruments on this one. 
* this is a serve, helps to carry the case along

Bx4

Cx2

* Intro hits me like a brick. Also, Ron is an uke

# Luke Atmey ~ I Just Want Love/Look at Me: A [5.0455]

Sx8

* This one has such a fun melody that perfectly encapsulates Luke's essence. 
* HAHAHAHEHEHEHEHEHEHHIIHIHIHUHOHOHOHOUIHA

Ax8

* Whimsical and wicked. Love it.
* This music fits Luke Atmey SO well.
* Hee hee hee ha ha ha Aha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ho ho ho hee hee hee! Take a good look, everyone! Unable to find a rival worthy of my genius, I was forced to create one by myself! Here I am! The tragic clown...

Bx5

* I don't love Luke Atmey but this lowkey slaps lmao

Dx1

# Larry Butz ~ When Something Smells, It’s Usually Me: B [4]

Sx1

* It's Laurice!

Ax6

* Larry finally gets a theme! And it fits him very well too!
* Prime butz energy. (Something does smell in here...)

Bx9

* What I wanna know is why Larry didn't get his own theme in the first game.
* It's a fun song, it fits Larry. Good.
* it's good but i keep getting caught off guard by that one part which doesn't seem to fit the rest of the melody?

Cx4

* It fits Larry's derpiness (is that even a word???)

Dx2

* Too... cutesy(?) for Larry? Idk how to explain it but this feels like a general ""Strange Folk"" theme

# Godot ~ The Fragrance of Dark Coffee/The Fragrance of Darkness; That is Coffee: A+ [5.4091]

Sx14

* So cool, yet so sorrowful. Such is the taste of coffee.
* perfection
* Probably the most powerfully nostalgic song across the games for some reason
* Probably the most modern sounding song in the game, and a classic.
* Peak. The fact that this song can illicit so many different emotions in you depending on the context in which it's played, even though the song itself never changes, is proof of how perfect it is. It's Godot, man.
* I love this guy, so many memories with this theme omg

Ax4

* Holy suave. If I were more bisexual, I'd say this songs cements Godot as a male sex symbol. Also, bonus point for the undercurrent of sadness.
* Sorry, Godot, but I think coffee and milk is better.

Bx3

* Tis good, but I prefer his other theme. 

Cx1

# Recipe for Turnabout: B [3.9545]

Ax8

* Goes unreasonably hard; what the hekc is that prog bass
* They really spoiled the culprit from a third case!
* Honestly really good for the case it's in
* it's very suspenseful, i like it

Bx6

* This one’s so cool, but unfortunately it doesn’t really feel like it fits the more lighthearted mood of this case in practice

Cx7

* I don't even remember this one that well. 
* I dunno, not a huge fan of this one tbh.

Dx1

# Beauty Hermitage/Tres Bien: C+ [3.5]

Ax5

* And to add insult to injury, his food is inedible
* This soundtrack overall can be really serious, but Jean’s song is the perfect antidote for that
* This song is a lot like More Happy People from JFA. It's equally hated because of the case and characters it's associated with. I like it though.

Bx7

* It's a really good but really annoying song at the same time.
* Fits the vibe

Cx4

Dx6

* Too cutesy - I guess that makes sense.
* Don't hate it, but I couldn't listen to this for more than 20 minutes. 
* no <3

# Victor Kudo ~ A Painful Declaration, and a War Song/Martial Anthem of Misery: B [4.0909]

Sx4

* why did they give such a great theme to such a meh character
* I WILL NEVER HATE YOU, OLD MAN
* HE'S JUST AN OLD MAN, WHY IS IT SO FIRE??
* Capcom really put this banger with Kudo, huh?

Ax6

* Say what you will about Kudo, this song is great. Maybe too good for him.

Bx5

* Why does this old dude get such a cool theme.
* why does this guy of all people have a theme song?? anyway it's lowkey a banger if you listen carefully 

Cx3Dx3

* It’s just a bit heavy and annoying 
* Had potential? but Victor is a weirdo so can't really recover from that

Ex1

# Furio Tigre ~ Swingin’ Tiger: A [5.0909]

Sx8

* This theme SLAPS. 
* Walking cheeto
* We're doing fraudulence on a whole courtroom with this one!
* This song makes me roar

Ax8

* Absolute banger right there. 

Bx6

* I like the jazzy elements, a bit too 'bright' for who Furio Tigre is though

# Recollection ~ You Have Regrets/Reminiscences ~ Violetta Vitriol: B [3.9091]

Sx1

Ax5

* sounds like something that plays in a haunted house.
* Fits Viola super well

Bx8

* Solid reminiscence theme. The weakest in this game, but I listen to this one a lot.

Cx7

* I tend to often forget this song even exists. 
* Viola's reminiscence? More like Laurice's reminiscence 

Dx1

# Turnabout Beginnings: B+ [4.2727]

Sx5

* This might just be the best case intro theme. Perfect blend of intrigue, tension and nostalgia.
* Probably my fave case intro theme
* Might be the best case intro song.

Ax4

* I love the sad rendition of ""Turnabout Sisters"" at the end.
* I love this one. The beginning sounds so mysterious, and that bit of Turnabout Sisters at the end hits hard.
* i love the turnabout sisters section

Bx6

* Woah, what a great intro for a mid case!

Cx6

* I like the reference to Turnabout Sisters, otherwise nothing of note

Dx1

# Recollection ~ The Scenery Seen from Dusky Bridge/Reminiscences ~ The View from Dusky Bridge: A [4.9545]

Sx9

* Actually gave me shivers all over my body; it's so sorrowful. Would give SS if I could
* One of the best reminisce themes in the series. Extremely sad, just like the case itself. 
* Extremely desolate.
* I admire this reminiscence theme because it's not only sand but creepy as hell, these kind of multi layered themes are the ones that I just love.

Ax4

* One of the longest reminiscences I think
* This is possibly the most depressing and haunting song in the entire series. Really fits the vibe of the entire case it's attached to.

Bx8

* Reminds me of Turnabout Memories, really fits the case

Cx1

* It’s very memorable as a leitmotif, but gets a bit annoying

# Hazakura Temple: B+ [4.6364]

Sx5

* Best location theme in AA.
* I don't listen to it that often, but I really like the music for Hazukura Temple. It's very atmospheric and sets the mood for ""Bridge to the Turnabout.""
* There is already something about the Hazakura theme that just feels unnerving despite how calm this song is. 

Ax8

* Low back pains :(
* The instrumentation is perfect for the temple, and it has a mystery dungeon sound - comforting and lonely at the same time
* Atmospheric.
* I like how this kinda calls back to the Kurain Village theme, but makes it feel much more mysterious and unknown.

Bx5

* It's like the Kurain Village theme (from 2-2) but better

Cx4

# Elise Deauxnim ~ Gentle Melody: B+ [4.4545]

Sx3

Ax7

* Laurice can't have good things :'(
* Really good stuff.

Bx9

* Very serene and comfy. Shame Misty died though.
* Fits the mystery of ""Elise"", oddly Kurain-like
* it might be just me but i feel like it's too upbeat for her? idk

Cx3

# Investigation ~ Middle Stage/Further Investigation 2004: B+ [4.5909]

Sx5

* One of the best investigation themes Nuff said. 
* Middle with Core vibes. Funny because T&T doesn't have a core of its own
* They should’ve kept making middle investigation themes for future games
* Wish they have a Core 2004.

Ax5

Bx10

* Appropriately intense investigation music. 

Cx2

# Dahlia Hawthorne ~ Distant Traces of Beauty/The Visage of What Once Was: A [5.0909]

Sx9

* My all-time favorite theme for an Ace Attorney character. I will listen to it on repeat. It's such a perfect representation of Dahlia Hawthorne. Beautiful and gentle at first listen, but there's something darker lurking underneath.
* It’s peak. One underrated aspect of this theme is how there’s always two melodies going on at once, ie for being twins
* Absolutely chilling, and fits for both Dahlia and the other person.
* It's perfect. It sounds so sweet and soft and harmless at first glance, but with the context of Dahlia's true nature, this song is terrifying. Definitely one of the best pieces of music in all of AA.
* I felt so fucked when this played in 3-5, Unsettling yet so good, fits her character

Ax6

* It isn't even particularly malicious, it's very... cold. But Dahlia's fiery hate of everyone and everything more than makes up for it.
* The pettiest woman alive AND dead >:)

Bx7

* dahlia is pettan

# Recollection ~ The Bitter Taste/Bitterness of Truth: A+ [5.2727]

Sx12

* I can recall the exact sounds despite not having listened to it for almost a year. What a piece. It's the regret that fucking gets me.
* This. This is Godot's true theme. 
* Cry a lot
* Actually top 10 songs in the franchise excluding GAA (And there's a lot of fantastic songs.)
* And here it is folks. The best Reminiscence theme ever. I can't describe how hard this one hits me. The only case in all of AA to make me cry, and I still get emotional every time I listen to this.

Ax5

* The emotion pixel music can give is crazy

Bx4

* Improves a lot when it gets faster

Cx1

# Pressing Pursuit ~ Cornered/Pursuit ~ Cornered the Culprit 2004: A+ [5.5]

Sx15

* ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE USE OF LEGACY MUSIC!!!!
* Absolutely love the new arrangement for the classic pursuit theme. 
* IT RETURNED WHEN WE NEEDED IT THE MOST
* They took a excellent song, and made it twice as better.
* THIS IS THE HYPEST MOMENT IN THE ENTIRE SERIES HOLY SHIT AND THE FACT THAT THEY CHANGED THE SONG SLIGHTLY TO MAKE IT MORE POWERFUL AAAAAA
* So many good memories from 3-5, super hype as always
* this entire scene is amazing, and with music from the first game?? i ascended

Ax4

* Something feels missing.

Bx2

Cx1

# Pressing Pursuit ~ Cornered/Pursuit ~ Cornered the Culprit 2004 (Variation): A+ [5.5]

Sx15

* GODOT JUST FREAKING EXPLODED!
* Best moment in the franchise.
* SAME THING, I DON'T CARE THAT THEY REMOVED THE OPENING THIS IS STILL PEAK
* I love the extra bits they added, elevated an already amazing theme

Ax4

* Something still feels missing.

Bx2

Cx1

# Ringtone - Godot: B+ [4.6364]

Sx7

* This is my actual ringtone
* Most of the ringtones are generally elite (Except Klavier)

Ax4

* Remember that Godot's theme is canon to the story. Woahs
* Iconic but doesn't have the same depth as the original

Bx10

* Funny ringtone. 
* I mean, it's the best ringtone in the series. That's gotta count for something.

Fx1

# End: A [5.2273]

Sx11

* THE best ending credits theme and it's not even close
* My favorite credits theme in the entire series. Every time I hear it, it hits really hard in the feels. Truly gives the feeling that an era has ended here. 
* And thus the trilogy ends
* Such a conclusive song, yet JFA's is somehow even better.
* Best credits theme in the entire series. Possibly the best credits theme in anything ever? I'll get back to you on that one.
* this theme makes me feel every emotion at once. a brilliant end to a brilliant trilogy. and that turnabout sisters melody just makes me want to CRY

Ax6

Bx4

* Noice.
* I love the references to different themes in the trilogy 

Cx1

# The Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations OST: A+ [5.4318]

Sx8

* Overall, Trials and Tribulations has one of my favorite OSTs in the series and for a very good reason. The music in this game never misses, even if it's only slightly good compared to some more memorable and better tracks. There is not a bad song in this OST (besides tre bien). At worst, the songs are ""good"". 
* While T&T's OST is sort of lacking in some areas compared to it's predecessors, the things it does well are done so well that I would dare to say this is my favorite OST in the entire series. Everything about it screams ""finality"", which was the entire point. This was meant to be the last Ace Attorney game, and it left off on the best possible note, both in its story, and in its music.

A+x5

* YES. (Oh, sorry, I thought we were asking if Iris and Godot should come back.) I realized after listening to some of these tracks again that I don't love this soundtrack as much as I thought I did. But it does have some of my favorite pieces, mainly ""Dahlia Hawthorne,"" the end credits, and the courtroom theme.
* I think the good things about this soundtrack are its consistency, the use of melody, and also that the tracks tend to be more extended and layered compared to earlier games where some of them can be very repetitive. The only thing it seems to lack is standout tracks (for me), but my favourite is the pursuit theme, as well as Dahlia’s theme. It’s clear the composer thought a lot about the details and instruments they were using, and it pays off. Also, the case intros are a big step up

Ax8

* A step up from JFA, doesn't quite hit the highs of AA1.
* AA music is among my favorite music in any series.
* I liked the first two game's OSTs, but this one is the one that really made me obsess with the Ace Attorney music because this one is great, specially the core themes used for the trials and main characters, which is the most important of course so having some weak unimportant tracks doesn't really matter.
* Honestly so many bops, I think every single theme fits its character/case so well and the energy in the court themes is so good. Gave me good memories of my most recently finished and favourite game of the franchise currently.

I know it’s not good to fear monger and I’m not trying to. But each time I go to the grocery store there’s several dogs. There was one at this bar, the lady sat him on a seat and had it drink from a water glass. Another group brought a dog in and it was dark, late, and generally just why? Also restaurants, coffee shops, anywhere. And some of them are barking or uncontrolled. There was a dog fight in a coffee shop I went to. Because the 2 dogs did not like one another and someone dropped their coffee trying to hold them back. I saw a dog piss all over the cans in a store too. Owner didn’t care. In a target too, huge dog. And I’ve had some dogs stop and just stare at me so I cross the street. But usually there’s more dogs. I heard this is an issue everywhere not just my city.

Isaac cradled the cup for a moment, letting the heat anchor him. Morning had a habit of arriving like an unwritten sentence: light at the margin, the first word about to be placed. He read it like he read everything now, slowly, insistently, feeling for the spaces between lines.

His feet carried him to the department’s notice board with the quiet authority of habit. The board itself was a map of small anxieties: memos about ration adjustments, stamped clearance notices, a flier for a lost lantern, a note taped and retaped until its edges were softer than the paper beneath. The anonymous tip had been pinned exactly at eye level, as if the hand that left it wanted it to be read but not necessarily understood.

The notice was simple and clinical in its caution:

**ATTENTION:** Anonymous tip received. Group with a suspiciously large quantity of firearms spotted in the Magispirum sector, near the border between Tier 1 and Tier 2 housing districts. Investigation required. **DO NOT ENGAGE** unless absolutely necessary. Submit investigative reports to *Investigative Reports* under Admin > Submissions Desk.

He read it through three times. The first read was for content-  where, what, the blunt instruction not to engage. The second read was for tone- terse, bureaucratic, clipped, the sort of language used when the Pillar wanted plausible deniability. The third read was for omission. What had not been said was always more interesting than what had been. No one claimed the origin of the tip. No one described who had seen the group, what they looked like, or whether there had been shots fired. *The Mandate left too many blanks. Blanks were the places a Reader loved.*

He folded the notice under his thumb and let his pen rest against his knuckle. The kettle’s hum and the world’s distant clatter became a metronome. He set a small, private rule: gather facts before fear. *Observe first; narrate second.* 

Back in his room he spread his worn ledger open and let Caelastria’s map form in the margins of his mind. Magispirum- the mysticism and knowledge segment- hugged the inner ring, a place where speech bent toward ritual, where flyers for arcane classes mingled with ads for salvaging runs. The border between Tier 1 and Tier 2 housing was a seam where necessity met privilege: the lower tiers’ metal shacks lodged up against the more polished compounds of Tier 2 researchers and mid-level technicians. It was a place of comings and goings, of couriers passing at odd hours, of shadows that might be people, and people that might be more dangerous.

Isaac made a short list. He wrote in the margins, like a clerk annotating an old book:

* **Objective:** Confirm presence of armed group; ascertain whether firearms are functional, stored, or show signs of recent firing. Avoid direct engagement. Document and submit a report.  
* **Constraints:** Admin directive forbids engagement. High probability of armed individuals. Surveillance nodes present near the Tier 1/2 border. Patrol schedule predictable but tight.  
* **Tools:** Notebook, pen, small mirror, coded slip of Admin tape, satchel, cloak, ration token as minor barter, pocket camera (modified to look like an old tally-device), ear for cadence, silence for presence.  
* **Primary methods:** Observation, timing, acoustic reading (listen to cadence of voices), environmental reading (smells, heat, residue), discrete interviews (neighbors, courier staff), photographic evidence when safe, chain-of-custody notes for any physical evidence.  

Everything he needed fit into the satchel except the patience; that he had to carry inside his ribs. He rehearsed the walk in his head, like a man tracing a new sentence. The plan was not a theft or an assault; it was a reading mission. He would treat the area like a page: parse its punctuation, note repeated phrases (the timing of gates, the cadence of boots), and step into the small margins- the short windows of everyday routine no one else valued.

He thought of the Archivist’s reprimand and the Squirrel story- how a stubborn creature could be chewed by hounds. Today the hounds might be armed men, or worse, oversight. He promised himself to be neither boastful nor stubborn. He would not test the hounds. He would read their steps and report them to the desk.

The walk to Magispirum was a slow composition. The city’s hexes rearranged light into metallic slashes; the air tasted of ozone and old copper. Arcane lanterns along the inner corridors pulsed unevenly, throwing shadows different from the ones he knew- the skies had moods here, and Caelastria’s mood that morning was taut.

He took the lower route, flanking the market to avoid the main patrol lines. The market itself was a fresco of motion: vendors coaxing the early trade, children performing earnest coin-pleas, a pair of elders trading gossip like currency. He scanned them with the practiced patience of someone who catalogued stitches in the seams of people: a woman whose fingers tapped the same rhythm on the basket edge, *nervous habit*, a courier who checked his manifest three times without looking down, *anxious about a missing item*, a child with a coin tucked into his palm *deliberate hoarding*.

He noted the oddities: a vendor downshifted his stall’s sign to display a different emblem for half a minute; a maintenance cart idled across two junctions more frequently than his route map suggested. These were the little editorial marks, stray commas, that signaled other edits in the city’s text. The world was constantly editing itself; today there were more edits than ordinary.

At the border between Tier 1 and Tier 2, the architecture changed in a single breath. Tier 1’s patchwork metal and painted crates tightened into Tier 2’s welded joints and brushed steel. The smell altered, from the wet rot of improvised housing to the cleaner tang of research compounds. The border itself was an in-between, a narrow street where the city’s grammar shifted enough to make people pause and check their badges.

Two patrols bisected the street at predictable intervals. Isaac counted them in his head: *thirty-six, thirty-seven*, the longer beat between sweeps was his opening. He found a shadowed doorway and paused beneath it, letting the world pass like a line of text under his eyes. Observing was the first thing. Any action must be an annotation, not an erasure.

From his vantage point in the doorway, Isaac began to construct the page.

Across the narrow street, a low building tucked against a research block looked like a storefront when seen from the right light- a boarded hatch, handwritten posters, and a faded sign flapping in the breeze that advertised “Arcane Components - Small Lots.” It was the sort of shop that could be a legal vendor by day and a clandestine conduit by night. Men moved in and out of it, a stream measured and particular. He noticed three of them: a broad-shouldered man with a crooked gait, a thin woman who kept her head down, and a third young, lithe, with a habit of stretching his shoulder as though to crack a joint. All of them carried bulges beneath their coats. Bulges were easy to spot to someone who read cloth like a page; coats fold interestingly when they conceal hard objects.

A courier with a livery crate passed by; Isaac tracked the courier’s glance, the speed of his steps. The courier hesitated at the boarded hatch, took a second look, then moved on. *Did he know? Was this a signal?* The courier’s hesitation was a drop in tempo; it read like a footnote. He wrote it down in the ledger of his head.

Two children fought in the gutter over a scrap of bookbinding. A guard walking past pointed them toward a shelter and did not look back- that guard’s hesitation was another letter in the text. Guards often looked away when they were paid not to look; a Reader learned to read the way they did.

There were sounds beyond the obvious: a metallic clink behind the hatch that could be anything from a dropped hammer to the sound of a firearm being reassembled. Isaac had learned to parse acoustic signatures. A firearm’s inner clack was a precise, dry punctuation- not like the oily creak of a machine. His ears catalogued it like a typist noting the shift from comma to period.

He did not move immediately. The noticeboard had warned against engagement. His duty was to observe*, not to interfere.* If the men were smugglers, he would not step into the fray. He would build a report that could not be dismissed.

Time, in Caelastria, had rhythm; Isaac counted it the way others would count ration tokens. He timed the patrols, the courier flows, the times of day when the alley emptied. He mapped the small distractions he could exploit: the twice-hourly shift-change at the lab across the street, the sanitation tram that swept by ten minutes after the hour and left a thin, ozone-scented veil, the laundry cables that lowered on an automated schedule, masking sightlines for mere seconds.

He waited for the sanitation tram. It arrived on cue, wheels whining, lights flashing dim orange. The burst of noise and steam pushed people away from their posts, and the men at the hatch stepped out into the open for a second to push a crate through- an action that revealed the outline of the crate’s contents beneath the oilcloth: boxes stacked with heavy, rectangular profiles. The way light hit the corners argued geometry. Isaac’s fingers tightened on his notebook.

He jotted a quick cipher in the margin - a shorthand he had developed for edge-notes: *box profile - firearm-ish; rect corners; multiple units. Handler 3 with right shoulder tic.* That shorthand was his own chain of custody until he could replace it with photographic proof. He needed more than inference; he needed data that would stand before a desk of officials.

The men then carried the crate inside, bolting the hatch. One of them lingered, brushing soot from his gloves, *a tell*. He glanced up, scanning the street, and in that instant their eyes met. Isaac forced his face into the practiced neutrality of a man who merely enjoyed the weather. The man looked away, but not before Isaac caught the flash of recognition — they made a mark in the margin: *we are noticed.* That would complicate matters. Observed men who thought themselves observed tend to be more careful; smugglers who feel a watcher might move their stash sooner or bury it.

He did not chase them. That would be a fool’s move. He counted the next beats instead, waiting for the courier’s route to return, for the hatch to open again. The city’s grammar had to be respected; loud verbs attracted attention. He would operate with punctuation: subtle, precise, and invisible enough to be re-read later by any hand that cared to know.

If a street was a page, the people were its marginalia: small notes, scribbled and often discarded but full of meaning if read carefully. Isaac drifted toward a seam of conversation: two women on a bench, one sewing a stripped patch on a sleeve, the other watching the street through narrowed eyes.

He offered no interruption. He placed himself within their hearing, ordered nothing, and let the pieces fall into place. The craft of questioning a neighbor without making them feel questioned was subtle: one must be a presence like a table, something ordinary into which confessions could spill.

“Coffee, Lysa?” Isaac said, voice light, as if offering sugar. *A Reader always speaks like someone who will listen to ordinary things.* The women smiled politely; small talk is the softest snare.

“How goes the ration line?” Isaac asked after a moment- innocuous, harmless; but it bent the conversation into what he needed.

“Too slow,” Lysa replied. “But you know that. Tell me, though, that old hollow near the hatch? They’ve been there three days, more, and twice I’ve seen crates go in. Heavy ones. Heard a clack beneath the oilcloth once at dusk.” She flicked a finger, unbothered but precise. “I’d mind my children but they play near it. Afraid they’ll find trouble.”

His pen made a ghost of a mark in his mind. He asked the right questions- who, when, how often- and the answers aggregated into a picture. The neighbor’s voice was a line he could trace back to the hatch.

A courier crossing his path gave him another small share as he tucked a rip in his glove. “Saw a man leave the hatch last night with a pack that rattled like that damned grate back near the smelter,” he said, demonstrating the sound by clapping a palm against metal. “Looked ready. Not for toys.”

Each anecdote was a marginal note that confirmed the acoustic signature Isaac had already heard. He recorded them all: not as hearsay, but as corroboration. Three independent sources speaking of the same clack at the same hatch rose above rumor. He breathed a small inward satisfaction. He had substance to his insinuation.

Isaac preferred the old ways: pen, eye, memory. But the world was wired. He had a pocket camera, disguised to look like an archaic tally-device, with a lens small enough to hide in his palm. It was a pale imitation of a proper investigatory tool, but it fit his needs: a discreet photograph or two, timestamped by the device and later transubmitted to the Admin Report.

He set himself at a corner and tested angles, using reflective surfaces to see around corners: a shop window’s convex mirror, a polished dome on a courier cart, the face of a discarded tin can to catch a sideways view of the hatch. The best angles were the ones that offered the narrative without forcing detection. He took two pictures when the hatch opened: an angled crop of the crate edge and the broad shape beneath the oilcloth. The images were grainy but legible enough - rectangles against oilcloth with seams and metal brackets.

He saved the images to his private ledger device with a ritualistic care- label, timestamp, two copies. One copy he would encrypt and keep; the other he would upload to the Admin portal alongside his written report. Chain of custody in a city of the Pillar was less about ownership and more about plausible procedure: make it look like you found it in a morning’s duty, not like you orchestrated its absence.

When he reviewed the photos in the dim of a nearby corner, he noticed something else in the frame; a small smear on the crate’s corner, dark and uneven. Up close, it looked like soot; under magnification, flecks of a coppery residue clung to it. Copper could mean ammunition primer, or it could be many less violent things; chemistry trusted nothing without tests. But the smear was another data point. He labeled it *residue: possible primer* and added it to his ledger.

The snag came when a passerby- a woman with a basket of herbs and the sharp eyes of someone who had to be cautious to survive- gave him a look that said more than words. She paused, turned her head, and met his gaze. That single moment had weight; their eyes locked and the woman lifted a finger to her lips in a tiny, secretive sign: *Be careful.* She slipped away, leaving Isaac with a cramped sense of being watched in a way he hadn’t expected. The margin had margins. Someone else knew something. He catalogued the moment: *possible community watch.* He made a note to be more careful- he had been seen.

Events sped and slowed like a page being flipped by a nervous hand. The courier route changed; a maintenance alarm gargled in the compound across the way, giving the men at the hatch a reason to step away. Patrol cycles tightened unexpectedly. The look from the broad-shouldered man grew sharper, as if his awareness had shifted to Isaac’s corner. He was not a fool to test them now.

Isaac retreated at a pace. This mission was not a heist. It was a report-gathering operation mandated by the Administration. He had more than idle rumors now; he had photographs, three corroborating witness statements, and sensory residue pointing toward firearms. The rule was to never be candid without a net. He had enough to close the file he had opened in his head.

He chose instead to prepare for the next move. If the Admin’s desk wanted a clean, provable report, he would give them one. But he also considered the political reality: the Pillar might move to sweep the scene and claim the spoils; faction interests might intervene. If he wanted the full truth, to know whether these were smugglers, a sanctioned militia preparing outside their permit, or an organized mercenary cell, he would need more than what he could gather in one morning.

For now, he had to send the first report: crisp, careful, and impossible to shrug off.

He returned to his room at a pace that felt slow only because his mind was moving faster than his feet. He arranged his notes with the method of a man who had once been a transcriber for a solicitor. The report needed a voice of authority, a clear chain of evidence, and the restraint of someone who would not inject speculation into fact. He wrote in a formal register, then allowed himself a short preface in his own voice to contextualize the raw data.

Below is the report as Isaac composed it for the *Investigative Reports* submission slot. He attached the encrypted photographs, testimony slips (handwritten paraphrases signed with initials where interviewees wished anonymity), and a small chemical sample swab coded and sealed for lab analysis.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ADMIN: Investigative Reports — Submissions Desk** **From:** Isaac Veylen — Admin, Records (Contribution Level 1) **Date / Time of Report:** Cycle Date 2578.09.13 — Observations between 07:20–10:40 local. **Location:** Magispirum Sector, near border of Tier 1 / Tier 2 housing districts. Specific point observed: boarded hatch adjacent to 14 North Warren (hereafter “the hatch”). **Notice Origin:** Anonymous tip posted to departmental notice board. Directive: DO NOT ENGAGE. This report follows that directive.

**Summary:** Between 07:20 and 10:40, I conducted non-contact surveillance of a boarded business adjacent to the Tier 1/Tier 2 border. Observations indicate periodic transfer of heavy crates into the boarded hatch, auditory signatures consistent with metal-on-metal contact inside the crates, and three individuals (hereafter Person A, B, and C) observed carrying bulges under coats consistent with hard objects. Photographic evidence (EncryptedFiles\_001–002) shows rectangular silhouettes within one crate. Residue sampling of crate exterior (SampleCode: VY-2578-09-13-A) indicates particulate consistent with soot and possible copper primer; analysis recommended. Multiple neighborhood witnesses corroborate presence and frequency of crate transfers. No shots were fired while on site. No engagement occurred.

**Detailed Observations / Chronology:**

* **07:12:** Arrived at vantage point east of 14 North Warren. Began passive observation; noted patrol schedule and courier cadence. Patrol sweeps recorded at \~07:24, \~07:36.  
* **07:28:** First observed three individuals (Person A — broad-shouldered male, Person B — thin female with low gaze, Person C — young male, lithe) arrive at hatch. Each carried what appeared to be rectangular packages beneath coats. Noted gait and coat folds indicating concealed hard shapes. Persons entered hatch and carried out at least one heavy crate. Hatch closed and taped with additional seals that included irregular hand-drawn glyphs (Image: EncryptedFiles\_001).  
* **07:41:** Courier cart with government livery passed, paused briefly at the hatch. Courier hesitated and then moved on. Observed maintenance tech manipulate scanner at \~07:43, creating a 43-second distraction window. Within this window Persons A–C moved one more crate. Photographer devices captured angled images of the crate profile (EncryptedFiles\_002).  
* **08:05–09:20:** Multiple passersby reported hearing a metallic clack from inside the crate during handling. Three independent witnesses (Wit. Lysa (neighbor), Wit. Courier J. M., Wit. Market Vendor P.) provided statements on audio slip and agreed on the frequency of transfers (see attached). All witnesses requested anonymity or initials in public records.  
* **09:06:** Observed a small smear on the crate corner consistent with soot and a copperic particulate. Collected surface swab (see SampleCode above) with sterile swab; stored in sealed envelope pending lab analysis. (Chain-of-custody note attached.)  
* **09:35:** Noted a watchful presence among local residents; one individual gave a discreet personal warning that indicated community vigilance. No hostile action directed at me. I was observed briefly by one of Persons (Person C) but no direct engagement followed; I adopted a posture of non-confrontation and ceased close observation thereafter.  
* **10:20:** Error in clerk’s manifest at Admin lockup across the border (likely unrelated) created additional movement. Persons A–C used cover of routine to shift crates internally. No departure toward outside of Tier 2 observed while I was present.  

**Physical Evidence Collected:**

* Photographic records: EncryptedFiles\_001 (crate exterior, hatch seals), EncryptedFiles\_002 (crate silhouette inside oilcloth). Files are timestamped and encrypted with Admin-accepted cipher.  
* Surface swab: SampleCode VY-2578-09-13-A. Suspected residue: soot/metallic (preliminary visual assessment). Submit for chemical analysis to determine primer traces or other firearm-associated residues.  
* Witness statements (audio summaries attached as AudioSummary\_001–003; paraphrased transcripts included). Witnesses request anonymity in public record.  

**Assessment / Interpretation:** The collected evidence suggests the presence of multiple heavy metallic objects stored and transferred through the hatch. Acoustic signature (metal-on-metal clack), visual silhouette, and the presence of metallic particulate on the crate’s exterior are consistent with the storage or transit of arms or firearm components. The possibility remains that the crates contain heavy industrial components unrelated to weapons; only laboratory analysis and potential official inventory checks can confirm. In short: *probable* presence of firearms or firearm components, *not confirmed*. No immediate threat to public observed during surveillance window; however, the frequency of transfers and concealment suggests an organized operation that merits official inspection.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Lab test** SampleCode VY-2578-09-13-A for primer and propellant residues. Prioritize result delivery.  
2. **Official inspection** of hatch 14 North Warren by sanctioned Admin response team during a controlled sweep with medical/legal observers present; avoid civilian disruption. For safety and chain-of-custody, recommended that the sweep be conducted under the authority of Admin enforcement with Neurotious liaison if psychological crowd control is required.  
3. **Temporary monitoring**: Delay overt raid. Continue passive observation with an official presence and covert camera placement (Admin-provided) to document further transfers. If possible, coordinate with environmental tech to test for ejection signatures (spent-smoke traces).  
4. **Community liaison**: Engage the neighbor network (discreetly) to secure additional witness statements and reduce civilian exposure. Do not broadcast details publicly.  
5. **Follow-up report**: I will continue passive surveillance off-site and prepare an addendum upon lab results or further observable movement. Requesting clearance to upload attachments to Admin Submissions Desk and to coordinate with evidence custody personnel.  

**Chain of Custody / Attached Materials:**

* EncryptedFiles\_001 & 002 (photographs); AudioSummary\_001–003 (witness summaries); SampleCode VY-2578-09-13-A (sealed) — all attached.  
* Notarized signature and timestamp appended herewith.  

**Filed by:** Isaac Veylen (Admin, Records) — signature encoded. **Note:** I complied with the “do not engage” directive; no physical intervention or removal attempted. All actions were non-confrontational and within limits of a Level 1 contributor’s permitted observation.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He read the report aloud once, not because the words needed proof of voice, but because speaking them let him feel whether the sentences held true or had been padded with fear. The style was dry and factual, but not cold. A Reader’s report must be a map that any official hand could follow to find the place he had described.

He attached the encrypted files, sealed the sample with his coded seal, and double-checked the chain-of-custody notes for the swab. A small ritual: label, timestamp, two copies, one upload, one physical emergency cache. He wanted the Admin desk to receive something that could not be brushed away as rumor.

The Submissions Desk was a pale arc of metal and glass, bureaucracy made into architecture. A clerk glanced at his tablet, then at Isaac’s neat stack of attachments. She raised an eyebrow at the sealed swab and the encrypted files. “You were thorough,” she said without inflection. “You’re sure you don’t want to hand it to enforcement? They’d like their hands on this.”

He shook his head once. “The directive limited engagement. I observed and reported. Enforcement should act on your authority.” He kept his voice neutral; this was not the place for argument.

The clerk tapped the tablet, accepted the upload, stamped the physical sealer with an acknowledgement slip and fed it into the evidence queue with mechanical care. The submission terminal gave him a quiet chime and an encoded receipt. He tucked the receipt into the inner pocket of his coat as one tucks a small, brittle privilege.

On the walk back, the city felt altered. The text of it had been written over by his own sentence; someone else would now read it and choose whether to mark it red with enforcement or nothing at all. He had fulfilled his mission: observe, collect, submit. He had made the picture with words and evidence. He had not engaged. He had not been the hound and he had not been the squirrel; perhaps he was neither mountain nor trembling creature, but an index in the back of a book: quietly necessary, often ignored, but vital if one sought truth.

Back in his room, he laid a cup to cool and unpacked the satchel. He removed the encrypted files and rechecked their readouts, committing the pixels to memory as a reader commits a line of verse. He opened his ledger and wrote the mission as an entry, filing it under *Magispirum Observations - 2578.09.13*. Then, because he had recently learned the Archivist judged not only results but also method and craft, he composed a brief personal addendum, a margin note about what the photographs did not show: no sign of loaded magazines in the passing frames, no smell of fresh discharge in the air beyond the small smear. That margin note was his cautionary line: *probable, not confirmed.*

He rested his pen atop the page and, just for a moment, allowed that thin, private smile to return. He thought of Edric Harroway, not as a ghostly reproach but as the voice that had once urged him forward. He would not be rash. He would not be the stubborn squirrel that tore itself to pieces. But he had found a page that would not be ignored.

He lit a small tobacco pipe and watched the smoke curl like ink across a margin. Outside, Caelastria hummed and the sky scratched above them with a light that sometimes looked like a sun and sometimes like warning. He whispered to himself what he had written in the report:

*“Record. Remember. Endure.”*

Also from Canada to the US🫠","I know this is a weird situation, but there’s a lot going on lol. I am officially moving in with my bf (44m) in Beverly Hills, currently living with my dad in Toronto Ontario and never told him I had a bf. 

I’m 25 and currently live at home kinda… I am not super close with my dad, he has a girlfriend and kids who I’m not close with so I just sleep here. I do actually travel for work a bit, but even when working in Canada I’m 2-3 hours away so not around to to much.

Not extremely close with my brother but he’s crazy protective and it’s annoying, and I think he’s going to be annoying about this. Same with my dad. My mom passed away

Closest with my grandma but never told her either because she would tell them..

Back in 2023 I went to California for work for 2 weeks, I worked in Beverly Hills one day and met a guy there at a coffee shop.

He is 44 now, so at the time 42. I really really like him, I had never really dated before him. 

For the past few years I have lied to everyone saying I was going there for work, when he’s been flying me out and I’ve stayed with him for a month or so at a time. I have been with him more than at home. I’m Canadian and finally got my 0-1 visa.. so I’m making the move to California and moving in with him. I’ve also went on business trips with him to quite a few places and told them it was my own business and I was alone.. but I’ll probably leave that part out. He’s taking me to bora bora for his birthday in November so I really can’t think of a way to not tell them the truth about that, everyone knows I can’t afford that

The only difference will be I’m not coming back this time though. I pretty much already lived with him but because I didn’t have my 0-1 and was just auditioning/testing for stuff I kept having to come back to Canada for jobs

I feel like I kind of have to tell them now but I don’t know what to do.

I have a feeling they all (except my grandma) will have an issue with the age gap, I’m scared they will take it out on him somehow and act like I’m in some sort of danger.

In the end I know I’m 25 and can do what I want, but I’m scared to bring it up and I don’t know what to say. 


I do plan for them to meet him soon, once I see their initial reaction. I think once they met him it would be better? I think the age gap is going to be an issue for my dad and my Brother. I really don’t care that much about them being upset I’m more scared they’re going to go straight to wanting to fight him

To dads of women in their 20s just curious, how exactly would you react to this information lol.

My plan is to tell them all about him first before his age. He’s a really good and hardworking guy, he owns a business and a home. He treats me amazing, and we have a lot in common. These are things I feel my dad will care about. He’s really hardworking so I think he respects other hardworking people

And then add the age, and when we met.

Parents, not just dads would you be okay with this age gap? Genuinely asking and if not would you actually try to do anything? Also if you’re wondering why the lie went on so long, I really don’t know. I didn’t realize I was going to want to marry this man one day. & I knew my dad wouldn’t be okay with me doing stuff with a man in his 40s but since we are getting serious. I think he might even propose on one of our next trips!!",0,1759282075.0,relationship_advice,28,0.36,False

1nuux0s,https://i.redd.it/hqq0ejl9iesf1.jpeg,Scared to Eat,"On the most recent podcast with Angel, they were discussing how a lot of people enjoyed the 24/7 Kitchen. When Angel stayed at the mansion for her test, she constantly called down to order food! 

Bridget said she was “scared to eat” and was very shy about asking for food. WTF??? 

When Anastasia did her interview she mentioned that Bridget would not eat breakfast or lunch! Just a coffee in the morning. Since they were out all day running errands, Anastasia got tired of being hungry around lunch time. So, to solve this issue, she started ordering big breakfasts, like cereal AND eggs with bacon. 

Bridget noticed this and got MAD AT ANASTASIA FOR ORDERING TOO MUCH FOOD??? BECAUSE SHE DIDNT WANT HEF TO THINK SHE WAS PUTTING STRAIN ON THE KITCHEN???

1nuuwgj,https://v.redd.it/gdrp0nbrhesf1,Wan 2.5 is really really good (native audio generation is awesome!),"I did a bunch of tests to see just how good Wan 2.5 is, and honestly, it seems very close if not comparable to Veo3 in most areas.

First, here are all the prompts for the videos I showed:

*1. The white dragon warrior stands still, eyes full of determination and strength. The camera slowly moves closer or circles around the warrior, highlighting the powerful presence and heroic spirit of the character.*

*2. A lone figure stands on an arctic ridge as the camera pulls back to reveal the Northern Lights dancing across the sky above jagged icebergs.*

*3. The armored knight stands solemnly among towering moss-covered trees, hands resting on the hilt of their sword. Shafts of golden sunlight pierce through the dense canopy, illuminating drifting particles in the air. The camera slowly circles around the knight, capturing the gleam of polished steel and the serene yet powerful presence of the figure. The scene feels sacred and cinematic, with atmospheric depth and a sense of timeless guardianship.*

This third one was image-to-video, all the rest are text-to-video.

*4. Japanese anime style with a cyberpunk aesthetic. A lone figure in a hooded jacket stands on a rain-soaked street at night, neon signs flickering in pink, blue, and green above. The camera tracks slowly from behind as the character walks forward, puddles rippling beneath their boots, reflecting glowing holograms and towering skyscrapers. Crowds of shadowy figures move along the sidewalks, illuminated by shifting holographic billboards. Drones buzz overhead, their red lights cutting through the mist. The atmosphere is moody and futuristic, with a pulsing synthwave soundtrack feel. The art style is detailed and cinematic, with glowing highlights, sharp contrasts, and dramatic framing straight out of a cyberpunk anime film.*

*5. A sleek blue Lamborghini speeds through a long tunnel at golden hour. Sunlight beams directly into the camera as the car approaches the tunnel exit, creating dramatic lens flares and warm highlights across the glossy paint. The camera begins locked in a steady side view of the car, holding the composition as it races forward. As the Lamborghini nears the end of the tunnel, the camera smoothly pulls back, revealing the tunnel opening ahead as golden light floods the frame. The atmosphere is cinematic and dynamic, emphasizing speed, elegance, and the interplay of light and motion.*

*6.* A cinematic tracking shot of a Ferrari Formula 1 car racing through the iconic Monaco Grand Prix circuit. The camera is fixed on the side of the car that is moving at high speed, capturing the sleek red bodywork glistening under the Mediterranean sun. The reflections of luxury yachts and waterfront buildings shimmer off its polished surface as it roars past. Crowds cheer from balconies and grandstands, while the blur of barriers and trackside advertisements emphasizes the car’s velocity. The sound design should highlight the high-pitched scream of the F1 engine, echoing against the tight urban walls. The atmosphere is glamorous, fast-paced, and intense, showcasing the thrill of racing in Monaco.

*7. A bustling restaurant kitchen glows under warm overhead lights, filled with the rhythmic clatter of pots, knives, and sizzling pans. In the center, a chef in a crisp white uniform and apron stands over a hot skillet. He lays a thick cut of steak onto the pan, and immediately it begins to sizzle loudly, sending up curls of steam and the rich aroma of searing meat. Beads of oil glisten and pop around the edges as the chef expertly flips the steak with tongs, revealing a perfectly caramelized crust. The camera captures close-up shots of the steak searing, the chef’s focused expression, and wide shots of the lively kitchen bustling behind him. The mood is intense yet precise, showcasing the artistry and energy of fine dining.*

*8.* A cozy, warmly lit coffee shop interior in the late morning. Sunlight filters through tall windows, casting golden rays across wooden tables and shelves lined with mugs and bags of beans. A young woman in casual clothes steps up to the counter, her posture relaxed but purposeful. Behind the counter, a friendly barista in an apron stands ready, with the soft hiss of the espresso machine punctuating the atmosphere. Other customers chat quietly in the background, their voices blending into a gentle ambient hum. The mood is inviting and everyday-realistic, grounded in natural detail. Woman: “Hi, I’ll have a cappuccino, please.” Barista (nodding as he rings it up): “Of course. That’ll be five dollars.”

Now, here are the main things I noticed:

1. Wan 2.1 is really good at dialogues. You can see that in the last two examples. HOWEVER, you can see in prompt 7 that we didn't even specify any dialogue, though it still did a great job at filling it in. If you want to avoid dialogue, make sure to include keywords like 'dialogue' and 'speaking' in the negative prompt.
2. Amazing camera motion, especially in the way it reveals the steak in example 7, and the way it sticks to the sides of the cars in examples 5 and 6.
3. Very good prompt adherence. If you want a very specific scene, it does a great job at interpreting your prompt, both in the video and the audio. It's also great at filling in details when the prompt is sparse (e.g. first two examples).
4. It's also great at background audio (see examples 4, 5, 6). I've noticed that even if you're not specific in the prompt, it still does a great job at filling in the audio naturally.
5. Finally, it does a great job across different animation styles, from very realistic videos (e.g. the examples with the cars) to beautiful animated looks (e.g. examples 3 and 4).

I also made a full tutorial breaking this all down. Feel free to watch :)

I’m also open to more generous sugar baby arrangements if that interests you.

1nuutgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1nuutgs/is_she/,Is she?,"My husband’s mom often makes odd, exaggerated comments about his looks. For example, after his new haircut she told him he looked nice, but then added very seriously: “you are so attractive. Women on the street always stare at you. I can see it. You need to realize how good-looking you are.” Actually, that’s not true, she was making it up..

He laughed it off, but she kept insisting. She said it right in front of me, almost as if he were single. It felt like she was crossing boundaries rather than giving a normal compliment.

Is this kind of behavior something you’ve seen with narcissistic parents, or could it just be her way of showing affection?

Another example: once at a family gathering, my husband’s mom made a very pointed comment in front of me. When her coffee cup was empty, she told him in a serious tone, “When a woman’s drink is empty, you should notice and refill it right away.” My husband quietly complied, clearly embarrassed, and the whole scene felt so strange and uncomfortable. It didn’t come across as a casual remark — it was more like she was putting him in his place with an odd expectation, almost like a dig rather than normal conversation.
