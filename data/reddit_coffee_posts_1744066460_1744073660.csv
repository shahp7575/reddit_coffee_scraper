35 male from San Jose, Seperated looking to start dating again. Have kids, but not full time. Looking for a normal mature woman for a little physical and emotional connection.

I’m educated and work in a field with majority males ( don’t worry, not a tech bro) so I don’t interface women often. I’m 5’8, full head of hair and told that I’m handsome often. I’m weight and height proportional, muscular but not a total gym rat. Don’t have a body type but do require weight and height proportionate, slightly chubby is fine. I am a sucker for super pretty faces. Any height is fine including taller.

I’m a nerdy gear head that loves machines as well as food and coffee. I’m a man’s man but very emotionally intelligent. I also love to be in the kitchen, whether it’s cooking or baking. Also coffee, I love coffee and matcha. 


Hoping to take it slow and swap pics, and if there’s a connection, meet for coffee. 

Let me know more about you!

1ju161y,https://i.redd.it/3hjx1ci4aite1.jpeg,Enter ZiiGaat Odyssey -- no cap. they slap.,"I've been out of the IEM game for at least a few years now, behind on a lot of the new trends and happenings. I moved out of a big city into a suburban house, which created a new, even more expensive hobby: Speakers. That said, the tariff thing had me panic-buying some of the latest IEM treats before they triple in price next month. Luckily, I'm going out with a banger.

Behold! The ZiiGaat Odyssey, one of the YouTube darlings in the $200ish price bracket. I snagged these from AliExpress for $170, which at the time made me nervous about buying them blindly.

For those of you reading who were born in the 80s, the first time I heard ZiiGaat, I immediately reminisced about Pinky and the Brain. I'm not gonna go back and check, but I'm fairly confident, with 72% certainty, that ""ZiiGaat"" was one of Pinky's Tourette's syndrome words. Fun. That's pretty much all I think about now when I see the name, and I'm totally fine with that.

The unboxing experience was rather lackluster, but I'm also perfectly fine with that as well. I immediately pushed aside the thin cable included and attached a beautiful OpenHeart cable that I ordered along with this Odyssey set (Amazing cable btw). I did the same with the included tips, immediately trying some Tangzu Tang Sancai standard --> wide bore. The wide bore tips had a better fit for my ear.

Alright, let's get to the good stuff: the sound. ZIIIGAAT!

The Odyssey has fantastic bass extension, with lifted sub-bass and thumpy mid-bass that I wasn't quite expecting! I really wouldn't change a thing, as this works well for rock and my girl Remi Wolf (best female pop star alive. Prove me wrong.)

Ziigaat seems to have something special going on in the midrange. It seems slightly forward to me relative to other sets that are meta-ish (Don't mean to spark a big debate on what ""Meta"" is).

Male vocals shine. I'm a big fan of the late Chris Cornell, and ""Say Hello 2 Heaven"" just mesmerizes. The Odyssey has a bit more mid-bass than say a Dusk, and it seems only slight. I suspect the ever-so-slight drop in sub-bass volume results in slightly beefier mid-bass? I'd love for a smarter person to explain this to me like I'm 5. Remi shines, as she should on such a finely tuned set, with the bass never getting in the way.

The treble is slightly spicy for me, as there seems to be a bit of lift around 4-5k. My ear is a bit sensitive to this, but not enough to really hurt the experience. The treble is otherwise smooth and quite enjoyable on most tracks I've tested. It probably doesn't reach quite as far as a micro-planar or EST (ugh... I used to have an OG Oracle and LOVED those), but frankly, that gets lost if you're wearing them out and about. These are IEMs after all, and that's how I use them -- out at the coffee shop or walking around town.

Oh! Speaking of which, there's no walking noise. I can wear these comfortably without hearing any big ""thump"" with each step, and they do a decent enough job of passively blocking noise. Awesome.

Feel free to ask questions. Maybe I'll answer.",1,1744073388.0,iems,1,1.0,False

Have been trying to quit for the past few months and keep failing, which is pissing me off as I thought I was mentally stronger than that, but then I realized this stuff is literally a hard drug. 90 percent of the world’s population regularly consume it. 

Failed again last weekend and had a horrible caffeine hangover today. Felt absolutely terrible. Decided I would crack and go get a coffee at the work machine. They were out, and I literally got so frustrated and realized in that moment the strength of my addiction. I bought a shitty canned latte and gulped it down right there, not even enjoying the taste but still guzzling it down. Felt even shitteir in a few hours and had to just sit in my car for a bit when I got home. Threw my coffee maker in the trash a bit later. 

I’m tired if this cycle. I’ve been trying to quit for years and only end up being able to for a couple months max. No more going back, this stuff isn’t for me. My anxiety has gotten out of control on this shit. I’m sure as you all know, you feel fine those first few weeks when you start consuming again, but then start to feel progressively worse as time goes on. I’m up to 2-3 a day, which is higher than my consumption has ever been, and I’m done. 

Those who know, know. We know we shouldn’t be consuming this shit, but it’s just so damn hard not to. I have to just accept my fears regarding withdrawals and just get through it. I have no other choice. 

Hope everyone is doing well in their recovery journey and for those of you with me that may be newer to the journey, join me and make tomorrow day 1. You know it’s the right thing to do. ",2,1744073209.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Got a problem with my website not showing up in Google at all for the past 8 months. So annoying.

I spent a bunch of money on some random guy who said he could fix it, but nope. Complete waste. So I went out and met with a bunch of digital marketing agencies in Buffalo. Here's what I found:

1. **Williams Media** \- These guys had the best campaigns I've seen from any marketing agency. They showed me work they did for this coffee shop I go to all the time, and the results were insane. Their team knows their stuff about technical SEO and content. But man, their prices... 10K minimum per month. Can't swing that for my small shop. Wish I could though.
2. **Hueston** \- Pretty sure I'm going with these guys. Found out they're actually owned by Williams Media, but they work with smaller businesses. They spent an hour asking me about my store before even talking about what they do. Big plus - they throw in unlimited website design with their SEO plan, so I get their great designs too. Makes sense for my store.
3. **Incept** \- Been around forever in Buffalo. They feel more corporate but not in a bad way. They brought the most detailed plans and showed some good case studies. Bit pricey but not crazy like Williams.
4. **theBREWROOM** \- Cool office (random I know). They had some nice ideas for local SEO and were straight up about how long things take. They do other marketing stuff too if you need it.
5. **Range Marketing** \- Newest company I met with and it shows. They gave me a free website check but it felt like they sent the same thing to everyone. When I asked how they'd fix certain issues, they got real vague. Took them like 3 days to answer my follow-up email too. Maybe ok for a super basic website?

I run a small shop in Elmwood and really need to get more people finding me online. Had a meeting with Hueston yesterday and think I'm gonna sign with them next week. Like that I'll get a new website as part of the deal.

Anyone worked with any of these agencies? How long before you saw any results? I know digital marketing isn't instant but hoping to see something by summer.

Let me know if you used someone else good too! My friend said his cousin does SEO but I want a real company with a track record lol.",1,1744073204.0,BufDigitalMktg,0,1.0,False
1ju13hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1ju13hz/the_taste_of_words/,The Taste of Words,"
They started as whispers—just on the edge of awareness.

The first time I noticed, I was editing an old essay. Every time I typed the word kindness, a trace of sugar brushed the back of my tongue, like powdered candy. When I deleted it and wrote cruel, the sweetness soured instantly, curdling into something sharp and metallic. Like sucking on a rusty nail.

I thought I was going crazy. Maybe I was.

But it kept happening.

Love tasted like strawberries.
Hate like spoiled meat.
Hope fizzed like soda.
Despair was ashes and cold coffee.

It didn’t matter if I read the word or typed it—if I thought it with enough focus, it came. Sweet or sour, bitter or bright. Words had flavors, and I was the only one tasting them.

At first, it was almost fun. A strange, private game. I tested it. Typed lists of random words, recorded the tastes like a flavor journal. I even got back into poetry, just to savor the ones that left a honeyed trail on my tongue.

But the novelty died the day I started a horror story.

It was supposed to be a writing exercise. Just something short. A little grisly, a little twisted. The kind of thing readers scroll past at midnight and forget by morning.

But the moment I typed the first death—a teenage girl drowned in her bathtub—I choked.

The taste was coppery. Warm, wet, and Metallic.

It was blood.

I spat into the sink and scraped my tongue with paper towels, but it clung to my throat like syrup. I chugged water and tried gargling mouthwash. Nothing helped. 

I told myself it was stress. Too much coffee. Too little sleep. But deep down, I knew. That taste hadn’t come from my imagination.

It had come from the story.

The next morning, it hit the news.
“Local Teen Found Dead in Bathtub. No Foul Play Suspected.”

Same age. Same description. Same name.

Katie.

I stared at the screen until my vision blurred. My heart thudded in my chest, slow and wrong. I told myself it was coincidence. It had to be.

But I kept writing.

I couldn’t help it. Something pushed me. Something hollow and hungry that wanted out.

Another story. Another death.

This time, a man set on fire in his basement.

The taste was worse. Burnt plastic and charred flesh. I vomited into the sink halfway through the paragraph, but I finished it anyway.

The next day:
“House Fire Claims Life of Retired Electrician.”

They found him in the basement.

Same details. Same method.

I stopped sleeping. My hands shook all the time. I disconnected the Wi-Fi. Turned off my phone. I told myself I wouldn’t write another word.

But the words didn’t need a keyboard anymore.

They crept into my head when the house went still. Slid behind my eyes and whispered to me in my dreams. I could taste them before I was even awake. And when I opened my eyes, they were still there—sticky and waiting.

Last night, I blacked out.

This morning, there was a new file on my laptop. No title. Just a date.

Today’s date.

I don’t remember writing it.

It described a man sitting in a dim room, hunched over a desk, blood dripping from his mouth. Fingers twitching across the keys. He’s trying to stop it. Trying to claw back what’s left of himself.

But it’s too late.

The words have taken root.

The story ends without punctuation. Just one line:

“He knows you’re reading this now.”

And in that moment I tasted something new.

Not blood or bile.

You.

I tasted you.

Faint and unmistakable. Like static on my tongue. Cold, electric fear. The flavor of curiosity laced with dread.

And now, as you read this, tell me—

What do you taste?

Last week I had Salads and cooked Defiant Coffee Salad. Hit level 60 with it partways through the week but grinned and bared it not being sure about being able to hit event drowsy power ranks.

This morning I rolled Salads again for week two, and because I didn't want to waste an entire week not leveling a dish, I bought a travel ticket and luckily re-rolled Desserts (only had one shot). But with my first meal, I critted on Eclairs and it hit 60. XD

I have Zing Zap Cola I can level. Eclairs were 59 and raenonx had projected M17. Cola is 53 and raenonx projects M14. Now, I suspect both projections are underestimated because have to do some swapping to hit 100% meal coverage - can't model this on a non-premium raenonx account. With Eclairs, I would have to do swaps for cacao and milk, and would likely need four ingredient specialists on full time for the week. However, my Cola team is stronger, with only leeks needing an assist, and my other ingredients will have lots of excess. So with Cola, I should have more opportunities to swap in a Golduck and/or a Dedenne, so I think the upside is higher.

Now here's my question. How much of an impact do you think this will have on event performance? Am I crazy for wanting to level an ""inferior"" recipe during an event week like this? The recent spoilers about the event make me more confident I'll be able to hit the event drowsy power ranks. What I don't know is how to estimate what a potential couple Snorlax ranks might do to event currency, etc. I think I might just be fretting over minutiae, but don't know how to think about this more quantitatively.

Any thoughts would be appreciated! Thanks! XD

I used to be more sociable in college, when I was cracking off-color jokes and relentlessly whining about my personal problems to anyone who would listen, but now that I have the maturity to realize that both of those habits repel normal, well-adjusted adults, I fear that I have nothing else to bring to the table as a person. I still like cartoons, anime, and video games, but can’t sustain a meaningful conversation with anyone about them. I don’t talk much to my male coworkers because I don’t want them to think that I’m boring or mentally-slow, and I typically avoid female coworkers because I don’t want to come across as creepy; while I am perfectly capable of behaving like a normal, respectful person around women I find attractive, I feel very uncomfortable around them because I can’t think of anything to talk about, and don’t want to make them uncomfortable by accidentally blurting out something odd or inappropriate. 

My problem is that while some part of me wants to connect with the people around me and not die alone, I’m hesitant to reach out for fear of social judgment. Even if I wanted to put myself out there and talk to people, where would I go? I don’t drink, so I can’t hang out in bars or clubs, and I’m not religious, so church is not particularly appealing. I could go to a gym, but the people there are generally focused on their workouts, and probably wouldn’t appreciate some random weirdo coming up to them to chat. The only place I frequent outside of work is a quaint little coffee shop, but I still haven’t worked up the nerve to talk to any of the patrons there, especially since I have nothing of substance to talk about.

Started my coffee journey accidentally, when I ordered a bag of ground coffee from sleepy owl and didn't understand why it was not dissolving.

Got V60 filters (without the V60 😭🤣) and God I have no idea why I went for so many jugaads to use the filter (rubber bands to hold the filter in place 😂. And ofc I had 0 idea about the pourover category.

Please help! I’ve tried everything!,"Hi everyone! I want to give you my full history just so that I can receive the help I need. I'm 30 years old, Asian. I never NEVER had acne as a teenager and in my 20s. I was diagnosed with PCOS at the age of 15. The doctor did prescribe me BCs but upon using them for 3months, and then stopping them (following what the doctor told me), the doctor then said I was PCOS-free and this was confirmed with an ultrasound. So I was devoid of any medication from the age 16-26. At the age of 27, I stopped getting my period and so I went to the gynecologist again who told me to initiate birth control. I was put on Sprintec. I had no issues with the medication and did not have acne. I would get the occasional zit sometimes just before my period. My periods regularized and I then stopped again per the doctors instructions. I was then devoid of BC usage from age 27-29. At 30, again my periods started to fluctuate. Because of my job, I switch states and I went to another gynecologist who prescribed me Yaz. On my second week of using Yaz, I broke out like never before. My face used to hurt to touch, I felt horrible and I didn't want to look into the mirror. My self esteem and confidence severely dipped and I longed for the skin I had before that didn't mandatorily require me to put on makeup every time I went out. I went to the doctor again and this time she prescribed Sprintec. I started to get my periods as usual and I saw the acne decrease SLOWLY. I then started to incorporate vitamin C and niacinamide with the hope of reducing my acne marks and hyperpigmentation. My routine looked like this:

Morning: Olay 7 in 1 facial cleanser/ yes to grapefruit cleanser, Vitamin C by ROC, 5% Niacinamide by the Ordinary, Moisturizer - drug store Meijer brand, Sunscreen- Kosas dreambeam sunlit tinted sunscreen/ nyx tinted sunscreen

Night- the same as the morning minus spf.

In between I would experiment and try adapalene. My skin tolerated it well but I started to have irritation and itching and so I stopped using it. I did not use it for a LONG time, max about 2-3 months and I felt like I didn't see any difference.

I have tried salicylic acid cleanser by cerave, benzoyl peroxide by neutrogena but it does not work. I've even tried oil cleansing, dermaplanning but my skin cannot tolerate them both and I breakout further. I've been using vitamin C for 4-5months now and I do see slight improvement but I just want to know how to fade those marks. I use micellar water to take off my makeup with cotton rounds and then double cleanse with the cleanser mentioned above. During weekends, I use the L'Oréal snake peel exfoliator and my face feels a little softer but no visible improvement. Moreover, when I tried doing facials, I would get extractions done but, after every facial id be RED and it would take a while for my skin to get back to normal and would take a month or so for the scars to fade which were produced from extraction. Sometimes I do get annoyed and squeeze out whatever I can with clean fingers and sometimes I get whiteheads but mostly I get sebaceous keratin plugs. As mentioned I have tried oil cleansing and it broke me out. I used the Anua oil cleanser for acne prone skin. My gynecologist did say that I may have to go on spironolactone but I feel like since I didn't do well on Yaz which has anti androgenic effects, I probably won't do well with spironolactone too. I'm too afraid to try since I feel I'll break out again and become worse than what I am currently. Since my crazy breakout with Yaz, I stopped sugars/processed foods, I eat only fruits/veggies, homemade meals. It's been over 5months now. I stopped dairy and my food has little to no oil. I do not eat junk food either although I do love dairy and junk food. I've sacrificed so much and I still feel like I'm back to zero and nothing seems to be improving my skin. My comedonal acne keeps getting worse and then turns into a full blown pimple creating even more marks. I walk around 6-7k steps a day and only eat clean. I don't have coffee just green tea. Are there any suggestions/routines I can do to help? I've never done a chemical peel/microneedling, maybe I should? Is there anything I'm doing wrong? The makeup I use is non-comedogenic and I wash my makeup brushes every week thoroughly. Please help!",1,1744072081.0,SkincareAddiction,3,1.0,False

When we started dating I was head over heels in love. I loved that man soo much. Too much even. I couldn’t wait see him, I always wanted to be with him. He was everything I had always dreamed of. He is so sweet and always wants to see me happy so he will do what needs to be done for me to be happy. This is the kind of man I have. Although I have to be honest over the past months we have been arguing about everything and anything. Literally the smallest thing ever. And it made me realize how impulsive he can be. Out of anger he will say things, then apologize. But je will do this over and over. We get into an argument be says something messed up, then will apologize. I love him so much that I looked past those things. Now a few weeks ago, he said something he has already partially mentioned before but he said it again and it really bothered me -the comment he made was something along the mines of who knows what the future holds we might not even be together anymore, this is not a fairytale- (and yes I had told him about it before, I am really big on communication). I brought it up and he didn’t seems to understand how this was/is a big red flag for me. What said bothered me so much, I asked him for time for myself and I also needed to think things through. Being so deeply in love with him made me lose myself. In the past months we had been dating, I had gained 20lbs, I barely cared about school as much, every decision I made included him at this point mu life revolved around him and God this was so bad. I had ask for a break as I needed to find myself again. I needed to remind myself who I am whiteout this man, because I couldn’t just live life like this was my husband. So I took that time for myself, and I needed it. Seriously this break made me not love him as much as I use to. We weren’t talking as much, no more long calls I spent more time alone or with my friends and went out of town to see family like this was good for me. Then came time for us to talk, and when I say nothing from that talk even made sense. He was barely interacting or seems interested he just kept saying im confused at to why you acted this way over what I said. And we were out in a restaurant when we had that conversation, and it was around lunch ish (the restaurant was not busy at all) but then a group came to eat and sat not too far from us and he didn’t want to talk about it anymore cause he was embarrassed. If you ask me, I am not satisfied at all about the conversation because it just feels like the even didn’t matter when it did. Anyways, this weekend he came over (and like all the other times, we argued before he came) if you ask me I should of told him to stay home. I was annoyed at him and it made me think how I don’t think we’re compatible. I have dreams, im optimistic, I love myself a lot and im confident (he isn’t too much), I love life and want to experience life to the fullest, I think about the future and how I want reach my goals. He isn’t this way, plus he does thing I truly hate. One of them being smoking cigarettes 🤮I hate it soo much, at first it wasnt a problem cause I love him so mich I looked past this, but now omg its such a turn off. He always smokes and drinks coffee and eat one meal a day which makes me question so many things. And when he doesn’t eat all day he has a nasty attitude that I just cannot deal with anymore. His teeth are stains and he barely knows how to brush his teeth(before we met he wasn’t brushing his tongue….) yeah, im just as disgust. Now im not trying to bash him, because we are still very much dating and in a relationship, but I don’t know what happen. After going to church on Friday I feel like God spoke to me. That man has never step foot in a church and when I ask him if he would want to come with me, he says its not in his plans anytime soon. Which again, we don’t align. Nothing aligns at all. I don’t know what to do. Im not trying to be impulsive and make a decision to break up with him, because I want to make sure its the right one, and I want to know this is the right decision. But I am very stuck here and I don’t know what to do nor how would I break up with him, cause I don’t want to hurt him or lose him. ",2,1744071290.0,TrueOffMyChest,6,0.75,False

So as the title makes note of I have a robust dream life with lots of speaking in my sleep and I also have aphantasia so would be very interested in hearing other people with aphantasia and their dreaming life.  

Firstly,  not health issues from my sleep. I do sleep well and the only real issue is in how talking in my sleep may bother my partner.  I have only ever had a few ""bad"" dreams or nightmares in the last 50 years.  Usually of an emotional nature for most of those.  I have thoroughly enjoyed every other dream,  even deliberately going into the basement during a semi lucid zombie themed dream. Fun times. The lack of any real or persistent continuity for the most part is annoying but I do revisit some same themed dreams occasionally.

I have over the last few months I have been using a sleep tracker and it records a few different things but I use the speech or talking recording.  The other stats do not hint at any loss of sleep.  I have a fun time listening to them in the morning with my coffee. Some days I can associate what I say in my sleep to a remembered dream or parts of it.  Most of the time it seems coherent, a bit odd but harmless.  

Its the frequency of them with some night having up to 20 recordings that baffles me.  The times seems odd to me as well as I go to sleep most nights 11pm or 11:30pm.  These recordings happen often between 1am and 2:30am and continue on some nights unit 5-6am.

1ju0f6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEARS/comments/1ju0f6g/sears_home_services_a_contradiction_in_terms/,Sears Home Services - A contradiction in terms,"I liked Sears.  I bought Kenmore products.  I like Kenmore products.  I'm in my sixties and have always shopped at Sears for tools and appliances, so naturally, I signed on with Sears Home Services when the warantee for my new stacking Washer/Dryer combo expired.

Well, the dryer finally started having problems last January.  Nothing major, just an odd squealing and a thud when starting, but I put in a repair ticket early on.

A technician came by promptly, listened to the dryer a couple of times, and announced that it was a simple pully and roller issue.  He collected the deductable, put in an order for the needed parts, told us he'd be back when the parts came in, and scarpered.

The parts arrived by the last week of January and we were scheduled for a repairman to come out in early February.  The day before our appointment, our area had the second-worst blizzard in recorded history, so it was understandable that they didn't show up the next day and rescheduled us for a couple of weeks later.

That was the beginning of their delays.  First, they couldn't make it and had to reschedule again.  Then the technician showed up and announced that he couldn't work on the dryer because he didn't have an assistant to help him unstack it.  Then he didn't even show up because he still didn't have an assistant.  Now we're into the latter part of March and I've been without a dryer since January.

Finally, a different repairman showed up, with an assistant, and they still couldn't get the damn dryer down, so they simply borrowed a step ladder and worked on it where it was.  Two hours later, he announced that they'd ordered the wrong parts and that the problem wasn't with the pully or roller, but with the motor.

Yeah, three months and around five appointments later and somebody finally cracked open the dryer and took a look inside.

He told me that they would cancel the repair ticket and that I had to put in a new one the next day.  Which I did and a repair man was supposed to show up on April 1st.  Appropriate, huh?

Now, if you know anything about Sears Home Services, you know that they never let you know when they're going to show up.  You get a date and told that they'll be there sometime between 0800 and 1700.  Oh, they text that the technician will call the morning of your appointment and let you know a better window when they'll be there, but they don't.  You simply get a text saying they're on their way when they are a client or two away from you.  A link to their website allows you to ""track"" them, but all it really does is show you how many are ahead of you.

So, April 1 comes and I'm sitting in the living room all day waiting.  I finally get the text that they're on their way around 1000, so I get ready.  I set up the stepladder and got myself a cup of coffee.  I noticed that I was out of sweetener and went into the basement to fetch more.  I came back upstairs, sweetened my coffee, and walked back to my computer.  I check the website.  ""Sorry we missed you.""  WTF!?  Son of a bitch showed up in the five minutes I was downstairs, knocked, and then took off?!

It took me a god awful amount of calling and screaming before I finally worked my way to the right phone number and a human being, but I let them know exactly how unhappy I was with their supposed ""service"" and demanded that they either turn that pixie of a technician around to take care of my dryer or cancel my account immediately.

Their supervisor's supervisor's supervisor was a very  talented woman.  She commiserated and apologized for ... well, everything that has gone wrong with their ""service"" since my initial call in early January, and did so sincerely enough that I actually bought it and found myself agreeing both to a new appointment for the 7th and to not cancel my account with them.  I even found myself apologizing to her for being so upset.  Like I said, she was very talented.  I recovered at the end to make sure that she understood that this was their last chance with me and, if he couldn't at least correctly diagnose the problem and get the proper repairs started on the 7th, I would no longer be a customer on the 8th.  She assured me that the tech would personally call, not text, when he was on the way with a definite time of arrival and would also call if I didn't answer the door in a reasonable amount of time to make sure I knew he was there.

Okay then ... okay.

Well, today was the 7th.  I'm sitting at my computer, compulsively watching the Sears Home Services website, watching for the ""our technician is on the way"" notice, when my colon speaks up.  It's around 1020 or so.

I check the site again, see that nobody is on the way, and retire to the loo.  A couple of minutes later, there is a knock on the front door.  I check my phone for any texts ... none.  I check the website ... nothing.  I finish my business and then check the front door.  Nobody.  I go back to my computer and double-check the website.  Still nothing; nobody on the way.

Ten minutes later, it changes to ""Sorry we missed you."" After promising me less than a week before that their technician would call first, would wait if I didn't immediately answer the door and even that he would call if I didn't answer the door ... I called Sears Home Services and canceled my account.  They apologized, they offered a free month, they offered to reimburse me if I wanted to have somebody else fix the dryer ... I told them I didn't give a fuck about their apology, that I didn't need an additional month of them not fixing my dryer, and that - in that they'd already proven themselves to be liars - I didn't believe they'd reimburse me a nickle.

People, I liked Sears and trusted Sears products, but I strongly recommend that any and all avoid Sears Home Services if at all possible.  They are incompetent and lie.

Small update:  My wife and I left the house on errans after all this.  While we were out, around 1400, I got a text that read ""Your Sears technician is on the way.  You can track the estimated arrival time at (link).""  I laughed and showed it to my wife, that after the guy showed up at 1030, we were only now getting the text message saying he was on the way.  When we got home around 1800, I double checked the website.

People, he came again and missed us again.  He showed up again at 1539.  No phone call, no text to let us know to be home; he just showed up a second time.

Unplugged/Acoustic
Solo Vocalists with a guitar or keyboard 
Powerful vocalists 

Tend to go for a jazzy, folksy, coffee bar vibe in music.

He told me it would be different this time. When he comes down here for short trips it’s always the same. He becomes selfish, I think, and fails to see me through his own feelings.

He told me this morning that he could live my life. Stay on top of my study. 

Gross underestimation I think. He barely can keep on top of and remember his own study. And it is a quarter of the amount of mine. I feel so frustrated at him. 

He can be ao dismissive of the work and amount of study I need to do. Belittles it and tells me that I should make the most of my time with him. He says he gets it, but then shows me he doesn’t.

I feel entirely smothered and without an inch of privacy. And then he has the nerve to insinuate that I am not caring enough or doing enough. And I just wish that in those moments he was mature enough to handle his own fucking feelings. And the little snide comments he makes when I am overwhelmed and tired. 

“Are you there?” he laughed last night. But with an edge of annoyance. I could hear the judgement straight through his voice, and only yesterday I had asked him not to use that tone with me.

I am withdrawn because I am sick of you and I miss myself.

And then he is covering me in kisses and poking me and throwing the pillow on my face. And a flash of annoyance runs through me each time. He wants my attention. I am overstimulated and I *need him to leave me alone*.

Truthfully, reader, I will be relieved when he leaves. I love him. But I don’t like him right now. How the hell can I tell him that without making it worse?

He has fallen into the trap of making the bed and making me meals and cleaning my car to try and *earn* my attention. All I see, and I do appreciate it, is the *expectation* in it all.

He wants me to give him things at the expense of my own life. He is blase about my life sometimes. He thinks I can do things tomorrow and have no consequences. It feels so selfish that he gives me no room to be myself and he constantly expects me to look happy and be attentive when I am *drowning* in school work and so terrified I am going to trip and fall back into depression.

Him being here is the first time I have wanted to cut and drink for a while. Purely out of frustration and burying feelings I can’t express for the fear of making the problem worse.

And that fucking cologne. I wish he wouldn’t wear it.

And he blames my irritability on the coffee. Can’t he see I haven’t had a second to myself since he got here?? I try and make space by going on my phone or hiding in the bath, but he judges that too.

I am so angry with him and I just needed to let it out somewhere.

I just need some space to breathe.

I was thrilled to get this job but slowly my line manager devolved into treating me terribly. This has been a common theme in my adult life and I can't help but think about what my father used to say: ""you are the common denominator in your life"" as in, take responsibility for it. Yet, each of these situations I've found myself in has been genuinely insane and hard to comprehend.  
I had a manager try to cover up me getting hurt by a client because they didn't take me to hospital right away.  
A different manager give me a formal write up for being 'Excessively Happy' at a supervision, she then also started calling me 'Sheldon' after some TV show about someone with autism.  
I worked for a small independent clothing shop and that manager found out I was mixed raced and then started saying I smelled like curry.  
Worked for a coffee shop after that and my direct supervisor just hated me for reason I never fully understood but it culminated in a customer complaining that she barked at me (like a dog) and I just left when I couldn't get support with them literally acting feral.

Next place I worked literally got closed down by the Care Quality Commission and I hung on as hard as I could for as long as I could.

Then I was a deputy manager at a book shop which was fine until the manager started digging into my history of >!CSA!< and became fixated on it and started asking the staff about it on the shop floor -> So I moved to managing my own store because I didn't want them to get fired (They were neurodivergent and it was spiralling into a situation where people were trying to make it a sexual thing when the reality was he was just entirely non-sexually fixated on the concept- which was still awful but I'm not ending a guy for that.)

This job was honestly way above my head but I've done a really good job, relocated for it, had some really harsh times. Got assaulted a little while back by a customer trying to break in but I even coped with that alright, I just got broken by my manager just flipping her shit on me for a few stupid reasons. One being that one of my colleagues lied and said I randomly left them for hours at some point, which didn't happen, I stepped outside for 10 minutes to deal with a volunteer in distress (Which I said to the manager and she replied that can't have been true because the other manager told her it had been hours), then the other thing was I had somehow gotten her in trouble by keeping accurate logs about an on-going incident. This on top of her randomly telling me I would be made redundant at the end of march, then saying that was a mistake after I panic sold a bunch of my stuff, then telling me I had to work on my day off (You get Sunday off don't you) and like... when I write these things down they're nuts, this is objectively heinous, but why does it keep happening to me? What deficiency is in me that this is a thing? It puts me in this state where I genuinely don't know if I want to quit this job even though it is making me sick, because what if it is me making it like this and that will follow me wherever I go?

My perception of what is acceptable has been so beaten and battered at this point I feel crazy. Does everyone just tolerate this crap? I mean for crying out loud I got accused of being 'Reverse Ablist' because I shut down a colleague for making fun of someone with learning disabilities for slurring their words. I feel like this is just a universal thing that anyone would say ""what the fuck?"" but apparently I'm the trouble maker?",1,1744070859.0,CPTSD,1,0.67,False

Lately, it’s been harder to find someone to talk to freely. My actual job is to prepare for things to go wrong, which is fitting because my brain kind of does the same thing, ""Always flirting with chaos and Issues."" I’ve got a nerdy side, a love for deep conversations, and a dark sense of humor. I'm always also in a light mood, but most of all, I'm in need of a connection that might keep me going. On the surface, I stay optimistic, but deep down, I wrestle with that quiet nihilism that makes it hard to see the point sometimes.

I guess I’m just looking for a friend or someone to talk to on a daily basis—someone who can talk about life, share random thoughts, and maybe help each other find a little more light in the mess. No pressure, no weirdness, no NSFW, just good conversations and a reminder that the world isn’t as isolating as it feels.

A little about me:

🔹 Tech geek by day, engineering specialist (both digital and personal) by night.

🔹 Sometimes sarcastic, witty, and a firm believer that memes are a love language.

🔹Cooking and making coffee is the way to know the other one.

🔹 Music taste? Industrial, metal, reggaeton, jazz and whatever fits the mood.

🔹 Into gaming (when i have time), horror movies from time to time, and fixing things most people would just replace.

🔹 A fan of waking someone up with a deep phrase or a simple good morning poem.

🔹 Big fan of deep, weird, and unfiltered conversations—sometimes geeky but mostly emotionally charged with poetry maybe.

What I’m looking for:

👉 Someone between these ages (26-45) who can enjoy good conversations and morning messages.

👉 Nerdy, goth, alternative, or just someone with their own unique spark.

👉 Bonus points if you like gaming, cooking, tech, horror, or just being delightfully weird.

Context: me (26F) and my BF (27M) are living together. We've been together from more than 3 years, almost 2 years living together, planning to get married and have children in the next 5 years. 

I never figured myself posting in a place like this, because my MIL has never been shitty. At the start of our relationship, I was pure joy, but later I've been struggling with depression and anxiety due to some social and laboral issues. The thing is: I can't leave my job in the next 2 years (I will run away ASAP), and my BF has to leave for laboral reasons. He would need to move like 500-600 kms away. During this bad times, my BF has been my rock, he has proved he's a good man, and my in-laws have never been really mean. I wasn't expecting this, no fucking way.

In the last 2 months, mostly last 2 weeks, my mental health has gone down. I'm more nervous than ever. Both my BF and me have been working in finding any way of being able to stay together, or, at least, to spend together as much time as possible. We love each other, and we're in this together. This takes me to last thursday. I was working all day, and he went to spend some time at his parents', as he usually does. He told them he feels sorry and afraid for me and my health. He told me they were really supportive, and they wanted to help. 

On Friday, I got a phone call from my godmother (let's call her Amy). Amy knows me really well, and she also knew my MIL before my BF and I started our relationship. So MIL has Amy's phone number. Amy told me my MIL has called her asking for help because she was ""worried about me"", and invited my BF and I to her house. On Saturday, we went there, and she served tea and biscuits, and we had a really nice talk about future posibilities. She was helpful and kind, and both of us left her house with a nice feeling. I also asked her not to give my MIL my mother's phone number, as I didn't want her to be in the middle of this (my mother has a previous history of overstepping and influencing my important choices, and I didn't want this for this time). 

On Sunday, I went to my MIL's house, as both my MIL and FIL wanted to talk to us. I really was expecting some comfort and help offers; I found an ambush. We sat at a table, no coffee, no tea, no biscuits, not a single glass of water. This is unusual for them, and I could have suspected, but I didn't. They asked me how I was feeling, and what was happening, which were my problems, and I was... sincere. Too sincere. I told them ALL of my problems. They just listened, and looked at me. I ended up in tears, being hold by my BF and shivering. Then, they told me I had been talking about me all the time, and this made me like a self-centered and selfish person. No chance for me to tell them it was because they have asked about me and my problems, and my BF is definitly not one of them. They were interrupting all the time, asking malicious questions, such as ""what do you want more, your boyfriend or your freedom for going on holidays with your friends?"", or ""you're all the time complaining, have you considered everybody may feel the same way about you?"". I had never complained about anything with them. All I had done is being less ""full of joy"" (around them, and around everybody else, because I'm depressed). This went on for longer and longer, and I was crying A LOT, shivering more and more, not able to even articulate words correctly, my mouth dry, not able to stay sit and walking around the room, raising my voice everytime I tried to speak. A complete mess. That's the point when my FIL looked at me and told me my tears were fake, and I was a terrible actress, that I should, at least, properly cry. I lost it. I took my coat, and I left hitting the door and screaming. Not my best moment, of course. It took five minutes to my BF to follow me and comfort me. During this time, they were in the middle of his way to the door, and didn't let him out until he gave them my own mother's number. My MIL called her right there.

My BF eventually got me back to my MIL's to pick up all my stuff I had forgotten. They said more shitty words, and my MIL had my whole life planned. She said we needed to let go all of our trips together, not a single one more, we will see each other at our living places one weekend every month, and during some more weeks of holidays from our job, that trips and plans with friends were off for me now that I was gonna be long-distance, and more hurting things. She called me frivolous, spoiled and unmature, and more things, but I was nodding with my head, my soul somewhere else, I was dissociated. 

We went home, both of us hurt and thunderstruck. It was the first time his parents acted like that, this was the first time they raised his voice and screamed, NOT A SINGLE TIME BEFORE. He's a naturallly peaceful person, calm and patient, and I've always thought his family was also like that. At my place, we're more ""lions"", we scream and easily get mad. He tried to defend me, but his words went lost in our verbal battle. We spent the night talking, we hug each other, and we went to sleep. In the morning, I got up for work (my BF is right now unemployed, and I have zero problem with this), and he told me he was cooking something nice for me. I kissed him, and I left. 

One hour later, my phone was vibrating like crazy. MIL and FIL drove to our home, knocked the door and told him to pack some things and leave for a week of vacation at the beach. He said not. He knew they were planning this vacation, before that we were considering joining them on the weekend, but he didn't want to go after everything that has happened. Then, they started saying I'm mistreating him, I'm coercing him, devaluating him, and he's ""obviously a mistreated man"". They even said that my own mother and Amy agreed with this, that my own family was saying that I was a bad girl for my BF. They urged him to pack all his stuff and leave me with a note, not looking back. He was considering going with them ""to fix things and talk to his brother, and explain this was a misunderstood"". But, when I read the note part, I was devastated. I told him that going to an isolated house on the beach with people who have suggested him to do a so extreme thing was not a good way to fixing things, but to lead himself to another trap. Finally, he told them to leave him alone, and they left for their vacations.

However, my MIL had the NERVE to call my own mother and Amy later. He told my mother I was an abuser, and he listed everything I had done to mistreat him (including things such as me being late to one family meal on a day after a nightshift or scrolling down my phone during some social gatherings, something I do more on the days I'm feeling to anxious to evade myself). This things can be wrong, but definitly NOT ABUSIVE. My mother softly told her to go to hell in both phone calls, saying I wasn't anything of this. MIL also said that the six of us should have sit to talk about my relationship with my BF to ""try to make a deal"". My mother (good for her) stated that the two of us are enough for talking about our own relationship, and everybody else should mind their business.

I've also contacted Amy to ask her what the heck did she say, and she said NOTHING. She called her twice, but she didn't give me all the information till today. When she asked her for help on Thursday-Friday, she wasn't worried at all about me. She had already decided that I wasn't ""the girl"" for ""her boy"", that I was abusive and our relationship was toxic. The words abuse and toxic were both used from the first time by her. She wanted Amy to convince me to let him just go, but, indeed, she decided to offer useful and comforting help. Good for her, however I really wonder why the heck didn't Amy warned me. She let me walk myself inside a trap with my guard completly down. I would have gone to my in-law's anyway, but I wouldn't have told them all of my personal stuff if I had known that. This is terrible, because my MIL is in contact with so many people at my job and I'm really worried about what will her next movement be. 

If anyone has stayed reading for SO SO LONG, I would appreciate any insight or advice. That's my BF's first time experiencing a so big family drama (or, at least, one that is related to him). I've struggled with family issues before, but this one is definitly in the podium (and winner of the ""unexpected"" category). Right now, looking at how has she behaved with me in the last months, I can find some signs of how she disliked me, but never expected anything so hardcore. When she knew me for the first times, she couldn't be happier with me, and she has always been nice, and my BF had told me so many times I was loved by her, so I never expected us to be in a situation like this one. However, now I realize that I may be not the first daughter-in-law who is given a similar treatment.

1ju06ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ju06ud/my_best_friend/,My “Best” Friend,"For some context, my “best” friend and I met in 2004. We were starting at the same high school in a small town, and we quickly became best friends. We went through it all together, and always had each other’s backs - or so I thought. 

When we were 15(F) we were both dating people, but at 15 how serious can that be right? We both met this older boy through his work, and hers and him and I quickly hit it off! Soon after him and I were hanging out at the new school I was attending, and meeting for coffee after we were both free. My best friend “Jane” and I both lived on our own (separately) and Chris was 18 and living his best life. 

I told my best friend I was going to leave the guy I was dating, because he was literally nothing I wanted, and I wanted to give things a shot with Chris! I was 16 now, and he had been meeting up with me for months. She obviously knew how much time we were spending together and how much the crush has developed over the time we hung out. But instead, she decided to confess HER feelings to HIM! So I stayed quiet as they started their causal fling. I was annoyed more and more, but I dealt with it and continued to be her best friend. 

Fast forward, we are 18 now, and living together. Jane, was caught cheating 3 relationships ago. And now in a serious relationship with this guy we’ll call Jim. He was a sweetheart and I really liked him, and my boyfriend Rene now lived with us, because I had his baby (I guess high school relationships can go somewhere). Chris kept coming over to our house to have seggs with Jane whenever Jim was at work. Rene and I “accidentally” let this slip to Jim which obviously started some turmoil. A month later Jim and Jane moved out, so I lost touch with them - and Chris. 

Jane and I reconnected after I left Rene, and started a new relationship with John. John and I had it great, we had similar interests, he knew my goals and dreams, and I thought everything was going to be perfect. Chris and I would meet up for coffee on the weekends with our other friends, and I couldn’t be happier that he became my best friend over the time that I didn’t have Jane. I confided in Jane about everything without thinking anything of it, and Jim and I continued to be very close. I had more children at 21 and 23, and everything was perfect. She was the godmother of all of them, and we hung out all the time. My relationship with John was deteriorating, but of course I didn’t think Jane had anything to do with that. When I tell you, this woman sat in my living room as defended me to CPS, I had NO idea she was the one calling with false claims. Until, her and Jim finally split over more cheating! 

I decided to cut ties when her and Jim split up because Jim told me everything, and John packed up and left telling me I can thank Jane. I was in a whirlwind. Turns out she was jealous that Chris still wanted to be with me after 8 years, and I had the family she wanted. I didn’t let Chris out of the friend zone though, and no I didn’t spill her secrets because I will take those to the grave with me. 

Fast forward a little further? I got my degree, worked several jobs and rocked the single mom life. Finally I decided it was time for me to be happy, and I shot my shot. 14 years of being best friends and 5 together? We’re getting married and have hella kids together!!

She has since been having a temper tantrum where she makes dramatic statements to me about how ""She can't be in the same house as him anymore"" and making a big show out of how she won't step foot in my house.  And I just shrug and say ""OK do whatever you want.""  I strait up don't care anymore and my therapist and I have been working for over a year on me not ""chasing after her when she pulls away"".  And I know it's driving her crazy.  When I was having tea at her place recently she dramatically said ""I've been excluding myself from your home and no one even noticed.""  I just calmly said back ""we noticed, but that's your choice to make and I respect it.""  She then said ""Well I just think for my mental health I need to stay away.""  Me: "" ok I respect that.  guess you won't be over much.""  Her ""it's been a whole month and no one even noticed!""  Me: "" as I said we did notice.  it feels like your feeling a bit hurt and unwanted and are trying to lure me into chasing after you to beg you to come back so youll feel wanted. I won't do that ever again.  I'm done with that.""  Her ""I wasn't doing that!  I just wanted space.""  Me : "" and you got it so presumably your happy with how things are now.""  Her ""but i never see you anymore"".  I just sipped my tea and said ""Well thats what you said you wanted right... so, your welcome.""

And omg guys this  ""Punishment"" she has been making us endure.  Chefs kiss.  it's so nice.  I told my partner he is being avoided by her and he laughed and said it was the greatest gift she could have given him.  I laughed and told him her blood would boil if she knew she was actually making him happier.  She invites only me and the boys over for supper once a week.  I would object to my partner being excluded but he is very much LOVING having a kid free afternoon every week to spend gaming and eating pizzas for supper.  Again her exclusion has been a unintended gift to him and shs would be livid if she figured that out.  And I've been so much calmer.  I sleep better and have more patience with myself.  And weirdly the less we see each other the more pleasant and enjoyable my time together with my mom actually is.  We can laugh more and have talks about topics we both enjoy.  And when she tries shit, I shoot it down and we move on.  I think she is finally seeing I will not be silently tolerating bullcrap and with only 1- 2 interactions a week and only very brief, often public interactions at that, she doesn't want to spend that time arguing.  And no she isn't cured.  She left a copy of ""alienated by your adult children"" or some such drivel on the coffee table when I last visited, it was the only thing out in the whole room and i could see her looking at it several times to make sure it was seen.  but I've reached a point where I just chuckled to myself and honestly thought ""meh maybe it will give her some useful tips to help her cope.  maybe not, who cares.""

I've done so much work in therapy and I still secretly grieve that my mom has never and will never do the therapy work she would need to do to have the relationship she wants to have.  I can tell and have always been able to tell she wants a deep trusting loving relationship with me. She's just so fundamentally broken by various things in her past she cannot fathom how to get to that desired end goal in any kind of healthy way.  She would need therapy for that and she will never do that therapy.  So my therapist and I have been doing the work to accept that fact, grieve, and move on and it has been really really paying off. Just wanted to share how much better I've been doing the last month.  it really feels like a win.  ",10,1744070379.0,JUSTNOMIL,2,1.0,False

I planned on getting a hand grinder either way as I know how important a good grinder is.

My coworker today told me I should just use cold brew instead. I tried some today and I didn’t love it just because the milk to coffee ratio is completely different.

I used to be more sociable in college, when I was cracking off-color jokes and relentlessly whining about my personal problems to anyone who would listen, but now that I have the maturity to realize that both of those habits repel normal, well-adjusted adults, I fear that I have nothing else to bring to the table as a person. I still like cartoons, anime, and video games, but can’t sustain a meaningful conversation with anyone about them. I don’t talk much to my male coworkers because I don’t want them to think that I’m boring or mentally-slow, and I typically avoid female coworkers because I don’t want to come across as creepy; while I am perfectly capable of behaving like a normal, respectful person around women I find attractive, I feel very uncomfortable around them because I can’t think of anything to talk about, and don’t want to make them uncomfortable by accidentally blurting out something odd or inappropriate. 

My problem is that while some part of me wants to connect with the people around me and not die alone, I’m hesitant to reach out for fear of social judgment. Even if I wanted to put myself out there and talk to people, where would I go? I don’t drink, so I can’t hang out in bars or clubs, and I’m not religious, so church is not particularly appealing. I could go to a gym, but the people there are generally focused on their workouts, and probably wouldn’t appreciate some random weirdo coming up to them to chat. The only place I frequent outside of work is a quaint little coffee shop, but I still haven’t worked up the nerve to talk to any of the patrons there, especially since I have nothing of substance to talk about.

1jtztwj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jtztwj,The way I make my drippy corn,"**Materials Needed**

Yellow corn (4-5 lbs dry)

Light Karo Corn Syrup (2fl oz)

Ground coffee (not spent grounds) 

Gypsum (quarter tsp)

Erythritol (half tsp)

Quart jars (6)



**Okay this is a write-up that I've done quite a few times but this is a little bit of a different process. So please read and use if you want and enjoy.**

First thing I do is take yellow corn and fill it up I'd say 2/5 of the way in a quart jar. You can't have it more than halfway full or the corn will try and bust off the lid of your jar. Make sure you fill it up only 2/5 of the way. 

Next I take my ingredients I start with Gypsum. I take a quarter of a teaspoon and I split this between all six jars. 

Next I take a quarter teaspoon of erythritol and split that in between all six jars. 

Next we add ground coffee, I use French roast pretty much the darkest coffee you can get and I had just a pinch to each jar as you can see in the photos. 

Next you take a shot glass which is 1.5 fluid oz and for six Court jars you're going to have to add two fluid ounces. So split up one shot glass into all six jars and then add tiny bit more in the shot glass and split it in between the rest. 

Last but the most important thing is now to add water you want to add water to about halfway up the jar maybe a little bit more the water is not going to matter because you're going to dump it out after. So you could really fill it up three quarters of the way and you'll be good. I have tried adding less water to see if the pressure cooker will press all the water into it and not have to drain and strain in a strainer or a colander. It just doesn't work. In the end you end up with corn that is nice and fluffy on the bottom and not on the top. So I highly recommend filling it above halfway with water after you've added all your ingredients. 

Cover the tops of the lid with tin foil so when your pressure cooking you do not get any water pushed into the jars. I have breathing ports and injection ports on mine and I hope you do as well it really help in the end.

Next you take your pressure cooker and you set a steamer basket in it if you have one. This is the elevate the jars off the bottom of the pressure cooker so they don't shake and break. Fill your pressure cooker with water to just under the top of steamer basket. If you have a silicone mat (the type that you put in your microwave) you can put this inside your pressure cooker like I do on top of my steamer basket. You can also put a silicone mat directly on the bottom and fill it with water if you don't have a steamer basket but you don't want to fill it with too much water so you have your jars floating so there's a fine line in between doing that that's why I highly recommend getting a steamer basket if you don't already have one. 

Next you place your jars with the lid a little loose inside your pressure cooker. However many jars you're doing with this method doesn't matter because you just fill it 2/5 of the way up the jar with grain but, the more the merrier. 

PC for 30-40 mins to hydrate your grain. You can do this process with rye as well you can use millet you can use whatever grain you want. And within 30 to 40 minutes it'll be fully hydrated. 

After your corn is hydrated you now dump it into a colander or strainer and shake it up a little bit and allow it to dry for 1 to 2 hours. Depending on the humidity and climate in the location where you live it could take three to four hours it all just depends. 

I store my jars upside down so all of the water can come out of them and place them on a paper towel and let him sit for the duration of drying my corn.

After your grain is dry you just take it pack it back into your jars at this point you can tighten the lid all the way for this last pressure cooking process to ensure you have sterile grain spawn. 

PC for 30-40 minutes and voila you just made your drippy corn.

Pat yourself on the back.

As fellow podcast enthusiasts (and potentially creators!), I wanted to share something I've been working on that dips into experimental territory for audio content: **Daily Digest** ([https://news.alpacha.fr/](https://news.alpacha.fr/)).

My goal was to create a super quick and easy way to get an essential news update in audio format every day, without the usual overwhelm of sifting through sources.

The core concept is a daily audio briefing, but here’s the twist relevant to this sub: **the entire process, from selecting the latest breaking stories to generating the voice reading them, is handled by AI.** It automatically produces a fresh ""episode"" daily.

Currently, it offers a general news digest covering major headlines – think of it as a proof-of-concept for AI-driven daily audio content.

The *really* exciting part I'm developing now is **personalization**. The plan is to allow listeners to:

* Connect their own trusted RSS feeds.
* Select specific news categories (e.g., Tech, World News, specific industries).
* Even set the preferred order for topics in their briefing.

Imagine a daily podcast-like briefing synthesized specifically for *your* interests, using the sources *you* trust, ready for your commute or morning coffee.

-Stayed at Sugar Loaf Lodge, clean and wonderfully communicative and accommodating. It’s old but it’s better put-together than many new places. 
-West Sedona was very walkable for us. My girls do all thrift shop clothing, and there were lots to choose from, plus grocery and drug stores. 
-It was also walking distance to some great hikes—Sugarloaf, Teacup, and Thunder Mountain. Even Airport could be walkable. We did the long hikes in the east/south  in the morning/afternoon, then I did the ones in the North/West in afternoon/evenings as out-and-backs for however long I had before sunset.
-Did Boynton Canyon (girls did subway cave while I waited below and sighed, cause I don’t approve of going off trails); Baldwin/Templeton/Cathedral; Munds Wagon; Airport Loop. 
-We like the woowoo stuff: did a sound bath at Sacred Rememberings, where she does group sound baths Tuesday and Friday at 3:30 for $33 per person!! Really nice space and person. If you’ve looked at other things of this kind, you’ll see this is a great value. Shops we like: Green Witch and Peace Place in Uptown; Cosmic Fire Apothecary and Rose Vortex coffee and tea in West Sedona. 
-I’m trying to be less of a plan-every-minute person and Sedona supported that more shambolic approach. Thanks to those who live and work there!

1jtzps7,https://www.reddit.com/r/inZOI/comments/1jtzps7/we_really_need_to_talk_about_food_waste_in_the/,We Really Need To Talk About Food Waste In The Game....,"Regardless whether your Zoi can cook or not, food goes to horrible waste in the game. YES. I know the game is Early Access. But a simple feature as fundamental as this needs to make a hot fix appearance in the next patch update. For starters:

1. First: Ordering on P Market delivery food app. Thanking the devs 100X for giving us Zoi Dash. But again the problem is the FOOD WASTE. My Zoi had cook skill 0 and didn't want to eat a stack of pancakes for dinner. So ordered expensive steak takeout. Box was delivered promptly on time! My hungry Zoi eagerly ran downstairs, collected his food box,  opened it up & grabbed a serving. Which turned out to be MUCH MORE THAN ONE. After getting hunger fulfilled by that delicious serving, I tried to get him to put the leftovers in fridge. And to my horror, found out this was 100% impossible....
2. FOOD WASTE: EVEN WORSE the intelli Zoi was on. So my neat freak Zoi immediately went to ""wash the dishes"". And to my horror, picked up the uneaten multiple portions of $$$$ meow steak he'd just bought off the table and CHUCKED it in the trash. Then happily began washing the dishes and cleaning up. A complete WASTE of  meow $$$ because he was a struggling, broke college student.
3. That brings us to LEFTOVERS. WHY can't you store food in the fridge to begin with? Once you Zoi makes  a meal, it's impossible to put this in the fridge. So if they have to drop everything to run to school/work etc. Putting it in their inventory is same result. The food is left to spoil. A complete waste of household money, cook time & ingredients. Same goes for delivery app food which results in problem as in #1 before. Or any drinks like coffee etc. they make.
4. INEFFICIENT PORTIONS. Cooking food is highly inefficient for proportions.  Single Zoi living alone, the cooking skill mechanic is ok with the default 1 meal they make. But sucks if you live in a multiple Zoi household. It WOULD BE REALLY GREAT if your Zoi had the option to cook multiple portions e.g. for 2, 4, or even 8 meals at once. So if they live alone, they could save time having to cook meals after a long, busy day
5. Being unable to gift other Zois a plate of food? Not sure if it's my game glitching on this. But can't seem to do this interaction. It would be nice to have the TS4 ability to gift other Zoi's food. Especially if you're on a date and trying to get your Zoi friend to eat with you. Or stranger Zois who seem to be begging or hungry.
6. Selling food you cook for profit? Haven't tried to place and sell food on P Market app as yet though. That would be a great way to skill up and make some decent meow.
7. Adding Open Food Interiors for Food Stores.  Since buying food from a Zoi vendor fast food stall is possible everywhere in game. So WHY can't our Zois enter a few of the many stores in the neighborhood and do the same? I get we can't open all the stores like the hamburger  or coffee shops for potential performance/lag reasons. Sooooo.......
8. Why not make most of the store fronts interactive rabbit holes? So Zois can enter and you get popup options beside their picture on the screen. And get to choose from a menu of choices.   Example, my Zoi enters that flower boutique in the plaza mall where the Bank is located in Bliss Bay. You can click on the menu beside their face to ""buy flowers"", or ""buy roses"" etc.  Then the Zoi exits the rabbit hole with the flowers in their inventory. Which they can then gift to their romantic interest or bff.  Same for the donut shop, bakery etc.  Zois can quickly drop into these rabbit holes around the hood. And buy a quick bite to eat to fulfill their hunger. Instead of having to go all the way to the beach or park to buy from the food trucks/Zoi vendors.

I'm especially suggesting #8, seeing it's likely possible we may not get open interiors for a few of those awesome store fronts in a hood like Bliss Bay. Which was DESIGNED for the ardent Zoi consumer!",13,1744069073.0,inZOI,5,0.81,False

For most of this year, at least since February, my hands have gradually been taking on more fluid, swelling, and immense pain. It started off a bit dull, but now it's at the point that I can barely make a fist without wincing in pain. 

They are not blue, or show any real signs of changing color. All fingers hurt the same. They don't hurt to the touch, and massages feel wonderful. As of a couple weeks ago, my wrists have also started hurting badly, and retain the most fluid. 

Here's all of the information I can provide:

Current prescriptions:
10 mg Adderall (only take maybe 4 times/week)
Doxycycline (for my HS)
Currently on TRT + Anastrozol, but haven't dosed in over 3 weeks. (I had 200-300 Testosterone levels)
Turmeric pills.
APAP for sleep apnea (only been using for a month or so, still getting used to it.)

Lifestyle:

-I'm a radio personality who works maybe 5-6 hours a day. I click and type, but not on any receptionist level. 
- I drink 12 oz of black coffee every morning. I usually drink at least 40 oz of water daily. 
-I do not use my hands extensively, as in gaming or crafts.
-Not very active, aside from a dog walk or two a week. I used to workout, but not very consistent.
-I dont smoke/drink/use drugs. 
-I started Intermittent fasting about 3 weeks ago to lose weight and so far it's working great. 
-I eat plenty of veggies, chicken, some occasional junk food snacks. My wife makes me juice shots from entire produce sections.

Doc visit results:

I've had blood work done to see if I was storing too much iron, whether naturally or because of TRT...everything came back fine. I had an EKG and scans done to check for clots, and all clear.

Family history: 
Mom has Raynaud's, dad passed from Cancer two years ago. 

I started my TRT around October of last year. I had no complications in the beginning. Around January I started getting some serious numbness in my left arm So we went to urgent Care, where I had the EKG and other tests done. The doctor informed me that my sleep apnea could have been a cause for my low testosterone, and some other complications I was having. I stopped my weekly T shots to see how my body would feel. The numbness in my shoulder has gone away. But that's about when I started getting pain in my hands. I do notice that while I sleep, every morning I wake up both my hands are in pain and fuzzy feeling.  I wonder if I'm cutting off the circulation by sleeping on my side too much and that's what's causing this pain? 

I'm extremely desperate for solutions. I can't even give my wife a back rub, and it hurts to do any daily tasks. I take Aleve daily, but nothing gets rid of the pain completely. One thing I did notice, there were a couple days where I was very active with my hands and it felt like the pain went away for the time being, but once I slow down it came back.",1,1744068943.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I think just not having that cup of coffee at Starbucks really can save you money. Plus the coffee isn't that great and coffee has gotten expensive. Bringing a water bottle instead of buying water bottles can save you money. Even when I go to the mall I can just get my water bottle from my car and not spend \~$3 on a Chick-fil-A iced tea. Having a good roommate can save you a substantial amount of money. I feel like talking more with people who have similar money values as you helps a lot.

1jtzmdy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jtzmdy,JRK:  Timeline of a clown 🤡           Let’s take a look at the chameleon known as House InHabit," 1/  EARLY JESS—AKA Mommy blogger:  
The Home renovations, surfer boy mom, coffee drinker & “ends the day with a warm bath” persona.  Cardigan sweater:  CHECK.  Ponytail:  CHECK.   Cultural appropriation of a a famous symbol of aboriginal culture, stripping it of all meaning, and selling it in order to claim you are a business owner:  CHECK⛺️.   Mommy blogger gained herself a moderate following amongst the crunchy crowd.  Not enough to quench her substantial thirst for attention tho.

2/. Next up:  Protester Jess.  The bohemian “Fighter of the good fight” Jess.   When flaunting beige aesthetic & co-opting other cultures didn’t bring in enough the dough, she scrubbed her face of makeup, grabbed her bolero & picket sign & headed to D.C.  Jess, ever the opportunist, knew she could elevate herself by jumping into a cause that was taking hold across America.  She could join her “sisters” to fight for women’s rights & racial equality.  This was the shortest lived version of Jessica.  She said the right words, held the right signs but had zero passion for the cause.  And why should she??  She reeks of white privilege, chardonnay and super kings.  Being a SoCal boys mom, women’s rights just aren’t in Jess’s wheelhouse.  She was merely one of millions.  The clicks & follows went to the true motivators.  They weren’t coming her way.  

3/.  Shifting gears & dumping the marginalized….Journalist Jess is born.   She ditched the protester garb & now donned a pantsuit & DIY press pass.  But what should the newly minted reporter report???  Celebrity dirt!!  Who doesn’t love the trials & tribulations of the rich & famous??   Reporting on the stars rose her Jessica own star.  Jess was no longer one in a million. She was one WITH a million point two.  Now she needed to parlay that 1.2 million into dollars.   But schleping ads & posting paid promotions wasn’t going to fund the lifestyle she craved…and Jessica had an ace up her blouse sleeve:  One Daphne Barak:  Millionaire socialite, owner & operator of America First SuperPac, Trump and RFK, Jr supporter & lifelong friend of the Maxwell family. (Yes. THAT Maxwell family).  



4/.  Final Jess:  The social climber.  Closets freshly filled with sequins & rhinestones, Gucci & Raybands.  It’s dumb luck more than anything that got her here.  Dumb luck that she doesn’t have to rely on paid promotions, like every other influencer since the dawn of influencing. Dumb luck that the only 2 women on the planet who support Ghislane Maxwell bonded over their shared love of a child trafficker.   Jess was Daphnes new play toy.  Ever wonder how Jess got that initial introduction to RFK, Jr??  Didn’t we all think it was strange that Jess got to interview Fergie, disgraced Duchess or York??  HOW did THAT happen???  Daphne supplied the access and the funding.  She got Jess access to the Kennedy compound, to Mar A Lago and other MAGA events.  She also gave Jessica a seat on her AmericaFirst SuperPac board.  From there Jess slithered amongst the highly coiffed & over juvedermed women & men of MAGA.  Collecting as many transactional friendships as she could she formed relationships as plastic as the persons themselves. 

So where did all this social climbing & backstabbing get the chameleon known as House InHabit??  Is she an independent journalist??  Well, do real journalists plagiarize their material??  Do they copy & paste from news sources they claim are fake news??  Do they brag of their greatness by posting compliment after self aggrandizing compliment that they receive??  Do they promise follow up articles that are paid for and never delivered??  Do they scream obscenities at those paying customers???  Can you call yourself a citizen journalist if your pickled, addled mind can’t get pencil to paper (or keyboard to screen, in this case) without massacring the English language??  If you claim to be a literate, shouldn’t you damn well be literate?? 


Jessica Reed Kraus is not without talents though.   Her gift is her grift.  She was able to amass a following by feeding her fans smoke & mirrors content.  The real story here is how did she get away with it for so long and how many people are going to stick around now that Jessica’s mask is stripped and people know who she really is.🤡

I’m supposed to be moving in tomorrow when my contract starts. Georgia officially left today.

On Saturday, Georgia text me and told me there might be things left in her room until this weekend, because she needs her partner to pick them up in his van. She sent a photo of a stacked pile of stuff (coffee table, boxes, guitar). I said that was no problem.
 
Georgia called me yesterday morning to say that she has yet to pack the room up and doesn’t have time (even though at this point she still had the entire day). So would it be okay if some more furniture stays in there too. At this point I’m annoyed, but I don’t like conflict so stupidly I agree.

Today, she text me to say that she had left and given the key to the estate agent as planned. She then followed up by saying “just to let you know, I’ve given Tony the spare key so he can pop in and take a few things to work with him” (to give to her boyfriend, because they work together)

I ask when I will be getting the spare key and she replies “I’m not sure, it depends how much Tony can take per day”. 

So essentially, they’ve agreed that Tony, a stranger, is allowed in MY room to take HER things, that shouldn’t even be in there? I am raging about this.

1jtzhab,https://www.reddit.com/r/wedding/comments/1jtzhab/we_got_married_twice_in_disney_sort_of_with/,We got married twice in Disney.. sort of (with pricing),"In the early 2000's we did the Disney Fairytale wedding deal. Married at the Pavilion, reception at Grand Floridian and used all the Disney vendors. I can't recall exact numbers, but I want to think about $12,000 for \~65 guests, the Disney DJ and the Disney photographer.

&nbsp;

Our takeaway from that, which would still hold true today, is that when you use the Disney DJ and Disney photographer, you get whoever they decide to send. In our case, they were ""ok"". DJ didn't play some songs we requested, wasn't very energetic, but certainly not a bad job. Same holds true for the photographer. The images we have are nice, but there aren't many of them.

&nbsp;

Fast forward a few decades and we renewed our vows, with lessons learned.

&nbsp;

Definitely buy the Fairytale Wedding Guide by Carrie Hayward. We are Disney people, visiting almost every year, and there was a lot of useful information in there that you just won't find anywhere. However, don't depend entirely on what the guide says. Disney is pretty complicated so the pricing on some things was not what we expected.

&nbsp;

We wanted to choose our own photographer so we can see their work and know who is capturing the moments we can never get back. You can request a specific Disney photographer, but they will not guarantee them (we used a fantastic Disney photographer for a private shoot in Celebration when he was laid off during covid, but they would not guarantee him). In our opinion trusting the quality of your once-in-a-lifetime photographs to fate is probably not a great idea.

&nbsp;

We also wanted to choose the DJ so we get somebody who matches our energy and has a proven record of providing a great time. For the love of God, do not use a Disney DJ. It is insane to trust music to somebody you don't know and who will be worried about playing risque\` songs.

&nbsp;

While it was great to have Disney handle everything for our wedding, we really wanted to be hands-on in everything that we did for our renewal. When you start using outside vendors, the Fairytale Wedding package becomes unappealing. However, there was no wedding planner-- just us (we did have coordinators for each venue). It was a LOT of work, so do not discount that you get a phenomenal dedicated coordinator with the Fairytale Weddings package.

&nbsp;

Having found Disney Fairytale wedding pricing to be unreasonable for our group size and for the manner in which we wanted to celebrate, we instead broke the celebration over 2 days-- on day 1 we renewed our vows at the Swan resort and followed it with a private dinner for 23 people. On day 2 we threw an insane (if I do say so myself) party at Disney's Yacht Club Convention center for about 65 people.

&nbsp;

This worked out extremely well for us. Our thought process:

&nbsp;

- there is never enough time to talk to all the people you would like to. Having the vow renewal on a separate day gave us more time to spend with our closest friends  
- having the vow renewal on different day allowed the photographer to really focus on our closest friends and family. We got some stunning photos  
- splitting the costs allowed for a better experience without increasing overall budget for us (ymmv)

&nbsp;

Here's the cost breakdown:

&nbsp;

# Vow renewal at Swan (done through Just Marry!):
- Ceremony: $3800, and includes a food and beverage package for 20 people ($45 extra per person, which we thought was extremely reasonable)  
- Aisle Petals: $300  
- Aisle Arrangements: 2x$300  
- Draping: $250  
- Pillars for Arrangements: $200  
- Delivery $130

&nbsp;

Our all-in contractual total for the Swan was $5,415, plus tip to our coordinator and her assistant on the day of the event.

&nbsp;

- Officiant: $225 for the service and we had him bring speakers and microphone for an additional $125 (total $350)  
- Photographer: $650 for 2 hours


&nbsp;

- Dinner: $3700 with tip at Todd English BlueZoo. This price includes drinks. Private dining is in a separate room-- first course/second course/main course/dessert. They provide a choice of menu when you book.

&nbsp;

Total for Day 1: $10,115

&nbsp;

# Party at Yacht Club (n.b. 5 hours, not typical 4)  
- Minimum spend: $20,000 with $18,000 being food and beverage for a space that accommodates 150 people. We ended up spending $25,000 for 65 people and an additional $2,250 on floral

&nbsp;

- We had an open bar with higher end liquor as well as some adds (eg an additional $174 for a case of Guinness). We paid an additional $220 for a second bartender.

&nbsp;

- We had buffet style dinner. Not because it was cheaper, but because everybody really wants a buffet style dinner. If they want 10 plates of beef, they get 10 plates of beef. If they want 4 bowls of mac&cheese (and yes, we had mac&cheese!) they get 4 bowls. Plated dinners just don't jive with our circle of friends. Ask yourself if you're doing plated because that's what *you* want, or because that's what you think is *expected*. Everybody LOVED the food!

&nbsp;

- We got a stunning cake for $650

&nbsp;

- We got a lot of adds like pizza ($320), coffee ($240), a carving station manned by a cast member ($250 for the cast member) and the double-dipped Mickey bars ($2000)

&nbsp;

- DJ (DO NOT SKIMP HERE): $2250 + tip

&nbsp;

- Photographer with second shooter and video (5 hours): $1900 + tip

&nbsp;

- Lighting: $4850 (uplights, pin spots, zoom/wash lights and a lot of other stuff) with lighting tech +tip

&nbsp;

Total for Day 2: $36,250 plus tips

#Our takeaways:

&nbsp;
- At the Swan, you do not need an arbor or anything like that. They wanted $1400 plus delivery for an arbor. You can get married under the beautiful trellis that is there and it costs nothing extra.

&nbsp;

- You will find wildly different pricing on officiants (one wanted $600). Find somebody you click with. We were extremely happy with ours. He even took off without a tip (I zelled it to him!)

&nbsp;

- Having the right coordinator with Just Marry! makes a HUGE difference.. our first coordinator was pretty bad.. and surprise, halfway through the planning she was replaced with an AWESOME coordinator.

&nbsp;

- Just Marry! will bill you 50% as soon as you agree to something. Definitely get your date locked in and pay the $1900 deposit. But for floral, decor etc.. there's no reason to commit to this 11 months out and have them sitting on thousands of your dollars. Certainly have them prepare pricing, but don't commit until you are closer to your date.

&nbsp;

- The food and beverage packages the Swan provides are very nice. Everybody enjoyed them. The FairyTale wedding guide is accurate on the choices.

&nbsp;

- Private dining at BlueZoo is AMAZING. We walked from the Swan right over there, which made it easy for guests. More than one person commented it was the best meal they ever had. If you want to make memories, that is a place to do it.

&nbsp;

- Doing anything at Disney is expensive. The Fairytale guide says a minimum $4500 for a Disney venue. I don't know where that is possible. Even when I questioned disney they said the minimum cost is a combination of several factors.

&nbsp;

- You have to use Disney Food and Beverage. Not that we wanted to do otherwise, but you cannot bring in anybody for this. The food and beverage was terrific. Disney does not allow Red Bull on property (no idea why).

&nbsp;

- EVERYTHING can be modified with Food & Beverage. Trust your coordinator to make suggestions. She was able to provide options that took advantage of certain ""loopholes"", ie if you have cold hors d'oeuvres, they will provide staff to carry them around. If you have hot hors d'oeuvres they put them on a table and guests need to serve themselves.

&nbsp;

- Do not be afraid to question pricing. We did get one food item adjusted and a floral item adjusted.

&nbsp;

- The double-dipped Mickey bars are expensive, but our coordinator recommended them as a real crowd pleaser.   She was right. If it's in the budget, we highly recommend them. Your guests will talk about them for weeks!

&nbsp;

- Adding things like a second bartender or a chef to carve the meat adds a bit of expense, but compared to the overall costs we thought they were worthwhile expenses.

&nbsp;

- Don't forget about lighting. Yes, it's expensive, but it really sets the mood. When the house lights went low and the music started banging the lighting really set the party apart. If you can't spring for a lighting contractor, make sure your DJ can provide some sort of light. Disney does not provide lighting in the convention center (but they can put you in contact with their preferred vendor. We chose our own vendor). We have no regrets spending the money here.

&nbsp;

- DJ.. GET A GOOD DJ. The DJ is arguably the most important person at the party (bartender being close second). Our DJ was AWESOME. We had guests with upcoming weddings inquiring as to whether or not he would travel to their wedding. DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

&nbsp;

- Photographer.. definitely have somebody do video. Think about a second shooter, which was not too much more (it didn't double the price). Having received both video and photos.. if we had to choose one or the other we would probably choose the video. ALSO, when you are looking at portfolios from photographers MAKE SURE you see photos from receptions-- dark spaces, multi-colored lighting (we didn't). Our photographer had stunning photos under normal lighting. The party photos were pretty bad, in our opinion. Also be sure to get the RAW photos from your photographer. Typically you get processed photos. In our case the processing on the photos looked pretty bad to us. We sent the raw photos out to be processed by another company.

&nbsp;

- Disney is going to charge you a $250 ""escort fee"" if you use an outside photographer. This is to assure the photographer doesn't take photos of ""restricted"" areas. No such escort showed up. I don't believe we were charged, either. Just be aware.

&nbsp;

- And lastly... insurance. Be on top of your vendors providing insurance certificates to the venues. Write it on your contracts. ""Vendor to submit certificate of liability insurance satisfactory as to form and content to \[venue\] by \[date\]"". We had issues, one of which was solved only 1 day before the event. Do not let your vendors drag their feet. Disney does not mess around with insurance.

&nbsp;

What would we do different? Not much, really. I wish we had chosen a different photographer for the party (although the video was good).

1jtzfk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jtzfk2/i_21f_feel_like_my_boyfriends22m_gaming_addiction/,I (21F) feel like my boyfriend’s(22M) gaming addiction is ruining our relationship.,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a long time. This past year was our first year living together so I have been able to see his gaming addiction up close and it makes me feel so lonely and unseen. I’ve talked to him several times since living together about how I feel like his gaming distracts him from our relationship and that I feel like he isn’t nourishing the relationship. Every time he says he’s going to change and he recently started keeping a headphone out to hear me better but it doesn’t matter to me if he hears me- it’s the fact that he is always on his game or his phone and it’s incredibly unattractive to me. When he’s not gaming he’s on Instagram reels or watching YouTube. He always always has something playing. He does have ADHD but I was also diagnosed with ADHD so I don’t feel this is a good excuse, especially if he loves me. 

I have recently given him hints about things I would appreciate such as if he were to get me a coffee from a coffee shop to surprise me or to take me on a cheap date or even just to walk with me. He won’t do any of it. He says he will but he doesn’t. This is not to say he doesn’t try. He does chores but so do I. He does try to make my life easier and always checks on me. I feel alone when he’s here and I find myself feeling sad but enjoying my alone time when he goes out. 

I also feel sexually unfulfilled as of late. When we have sex it feels really good but we have sex once every two weeks right now. It’s usually in the shower too which feels like it’s more of a convenience. He plays his games so much so there isn’t time to initiate and when I do “present” myself to him he ignores me and laughs it off. I’m serious when I tried to initiate the other day he said, “but we had sex yesterday” (it was actually 2 days before). It made me feel like shit. Just because we had sex this week we can’t have sex again? It seems like more of a chore to check off his list at that point. The other night I was crying because I felt like shit because of all of this and he asked me what was wrong and I told him that when I initiate sex he rejects me every time and it makes me feel sad and insecure. I would NEVER ever pressure someone to have sex with me and I always take no as an answer but being rejected over and over by your partner can be hurtful. He said his antidepressants lower his libido which I understand but he doesn’t think of my sexual needs. Recently I’ve found myself fantasizing over other men. They are men I have known. I fucking hate myself for it. I’m not even fantasizing about THEM- it’s fantasies of them wanting me. I know this is fucked and I don’t want to feel this way at all. I truly wish I didn’t feel this way but I just want to be wanted which I’ve been told is selfish. I know it’s not selfish but I know it’s wrong of me to think like this.

In short, the video game addiction has lead my man to be constantly distracted and it makes me feel alone. I don’t want to leave him, I want him to be better but I don’t know that he can be. I know ADHD comes in different forms so what he struggles with is different than what I might struggle with but it’s fucking with our relationship. We don’t go on dates and we don’t have sex very often. We also have a cat together and if we broke up I have no idea how I would manage that because we both love our cat to death. I love him and he makes me laugh like a kid when we are good and he compliments me every day and I have never been so close to anyone but it’s killing me.

1jtzf7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jtzf7t/if_you_see_a_painting_of_a_beautiful_redhead/,"If you see a painting of a beautiful redhead, destroy it.","The first thing I noticed was his hair. It was a deep, dark, crimson red. It stood out against the painting’s faded colors like a splash of dried blood.

The rest of him was just as beautiful. He was slender, with long, elegant hands. His skin might have once been marble white, but the paint had become sallow with age. His face had the “angelic” features Renaissance artists loved- high cheekbones and a perfect cupid’s bow. His eyes were not just striking- they were captivating. Impossibly wide and eerily dark. Those eyes, I would later realize, always had a look of profound sadness.

As I walked through the gallery, I found that he was in other paintings. In the older ones, he was lurking in the background: cowering from falling rubble during the fall of Rome, or lounging on the grass in a Bacchanal. In the later ones, he became the subject: Ganymede offering a jeweled goblet to Jupiter, or Saint Michael with his sword held high and his wings splayed wide.

I asked Dr. Clark about him. He gave a good-natured chuckle. “We call him ‘Il Rosso,’” he explained, “Selvaggio didn’t always credit his models, so the boy’s name was lost to history. He’s like the Venetian Mona Lisa.”

He ended his speech with one of his warm smiles. Doctor Ernest Clark looked every bit the genius he was: tall, broad-shouldered, a salt-and-pepper beard, wire-rimmed glasses. He was one of the most renowned art historians in the country, and the very last word in Renaissance Italian artwork.

I turned away so he wouldn’t see my excited grin. Three weeks in and I still couldn’t believe I’d landed this internship. Not to brag, but it was notoriously competitive. Before, I was just some art history student from a small-town college in Jersey. Now, I was at New York City’s largest art museum, helping the legendary Dr. Clark with the greatest achievement of his career. Dozens of Selvaggio’s paintings would be collected, restored, and available for public viewing for the first time in over 100 years. 

The gallery was set to open in two weeks. Dr. Clark and I were supervising its preparations. While we supervised, workers bustled around us trying to put everything in order.

Dr. Clark suddenly rushed forward. “Careful with that! Make sure it’s not in direct sunlight!” The workers groaned and tried to adjust the huge portrait.

I also moved forward to look at the painting. I’m only five feet tall, so I had to crane my neck up to see it. The painting showed Il Rosso as Saint Sebastian. He was nearly naked, tied to a tree and stuck all around with arrows. His red hair framed his face like a halo. He was staring directly at the viewer. 

“I could research him,” I said, “There has to be a record of him, somewhere. I could solve the mystery. I could make it my thesis!” I felt my excitement growing with every word.

“That sounds like an interesting research project,” Dr. Clark said. “And I’ll give you any help you need. Though I should warn you, Effie- many have tried to track this kid down. And many have failed.”

I tried to sound as confident as Dr. Clark always did. “I should at least learn *something* new.”

I stared harder at Il Rosso, matching his gaze as if accepting a challenge. Close up, I could see there were tears in his eyes.



As soon as I got to my apartment- really, my cousin’s apartment that I was subletting for the semester- I started researching. First step: the most academic of all sources, Google. I didn’t find much. Most articles just listed Il Rosso’s paintings- twelve in all- which, until now, were scattered around the world. Some tried to speculate on his identity, but had no real leads. The general consensus seemed to be that he was no one important. Not important enough for a name.

After a few hours, I moved onto academic databases. They weren’t much better. According to these articles, Il Rosso could have been anyone from a nobleman to a beautiful beggar plucked from the streets. Authors were more interested in discussing his impact on Selvaggio’s art, not who he was.

I didn’t plan on giving up. There had to be at least one clue, one thread I could follow. It wasn’t just an ambitious research project. There was something about Il Rosso that compelled me. Images of his red hair flashed at the corners of my vision. His dark eyes seemed to watch me until the moment I went to sleep. *Find me,* he seemed to say. *See. Me.*



It started out small, at first. I would hear footsteps around my apartment, though I lived alone. Small items would seem to move around when I wasn’t looking. I’d see flashes of movement in mirrors, only to turn around and see nothing. Typical haunting signs, I know. But things like that are easy to ignore. Stress, forgetfulness, suggestibility. All cause slips of the mind that mean nothing.

Two days later, I realized something was wrong. I was thumbing through a book about the painter Toulouse-Lautrec when I saw Il Rosso again. He was in one of the paintings, tucked away in the back of a café. He hadn’t been there before- a quick Google search of the original painting proved it. Hell, that was painted 300 years after Il Rosso would have lived! Yet he was in my book, a smear of vermillion paint serving as hair, two spots of black for his eyes.

Trembling, I dropped the book and picked up another. Then another. Somehow, he was in all of them! Everywhere from ancient frescoes to vintage magazine illustrations. I swear I even saw him in a comic book. Later I would even see him in other paintings at the museum. In all of them, he was looking directly at me. *Look at me. SEE. ME.*

It only got worse from there. I was walking through the crowded streets of Manhattan when I bumped into someone. After making sure I wasn’t pickpocketed, I looked up at the man to apologize. My stomach dropped. He may have been bundled up in a coat and scarf like everyone else, but I knew who he was. I felt a chill run through my body that had nothing to do with the windy fall day. I tried to speak but my mouth was too dry. He didn’t speak, either. He just stared. Then he was swept away by the crowd.

I began seeing him in more places. Sitting in a coffee shop, walking around the museum. He never spoke, but his eyes would follow me across the room. I even saw him in the elevator of my apartment building. In the confined space, his gaze became suffocating. Looking directly into his eyes made me dizzy. I felt the strong urge to reach out and touch him, to see if he was really there. But the elevator stopped, someone else stepped in, and when I looked back, he was gone.

When I returned to my apartment, I found my journal lying open, a note written inside. It was in Italian, so I’ll do my best to translate here:

*Miss Effie Briones-*

*I’m so glad you’re taking an interest in me. I promise that soon, all will be revealed.* 

*Il Rosso*

Heart pounding, I ripped out the page and threw it away. This had to be a prank, right? Except I lived alone, my door had been locked, and no one except Dr. Clark knew about my research project. 

There were no other explanations- Il Rosso was haunting me. My investigation had somehow invited him into this world, into my life. But what did he want? What was he planning to reveal? All I could do was keep researching. Finding something, anything, about him might lead me to an answer. But all I got were dead ends. 



A few days before the gallery opening, Dr. Clark asked me how my research process was going.

“Not great,” I replied. I made a show of poking around his cluttered office so I wouldn’t have to meet his eyes. “Most scholarly articles just talk about Selvaggio’s creative process. Nothing about Il Rosso himself.”

Dr. Clark shrugged, still filling out paperwork. “What can I say? Selvaggio was the genius. Il Rosso was just the face.”

I felt myself beginning to scowl. I loved Dr. Clark, but something about his flippant tone bothered me. “This kid modeled for the greatest artist of his day, in twelve different paintings, and then vanished off the face of the earth?”

Dr. Clark had stopped writing. “Some have speculated that the boy’s modeling ruined his reputation. That his family abandoned him, he had to change his name, maybe even flee Venice.”

I whirled around, face burning. “And Selvaggio was just okay with that?” I demanded. “Everyone just dumped this kid when he was no longer useful? How do you think *he* felt?”

Dr. Clark’s face darkened. For a second I thought I’d gone too far. My cheeks burned. Why was I so angry? Maybe because I could feel Il Rosso’s presence, like he was hiding between the crowded shelves. The observer who would always hear but never reply.

Instead Dr. Clark said, “I’m sure Il Rosso knew what he was risking. Sometimes great art requires sacrifice.” He returned to his papers in a way that suggested dismissal.

As I showed myself out, I grabbed a copy of the exhibit’s brochure. The back cover had Selvaggio’s painting *Abraham and Isaac*. A middle-aged man was shoving Il Rosso to the ground, face-first, holding a knife to his throat. Il Rosso’s beautiful face was contorted in a silent scream. 

When I returned to my apartment I found another note.

*Miss Effie Briones-*

*Thank you for defending me earlier today. Sometimes I am so lonely it becomes unbearable. I can’t wait for you to become my newest friend.*

*Il Rosso*

I felt my gut twist. I snapped my head around, searching for him in the darkest corners of the room. I couldn’t see him, but I knew he was still there. And I didn’t want to wait around to see what it meant to become his “friend.”



I gave up on the internet and databases, and started visiting the New York Public Library. Every night after leaving the museum, I would spend hours in the library’s dimly lit, musty upper rooms. I would have a table to myself, my only light being a tiny desk lamp and the glow of other buildings through the window. It was pretty eerie, but I’d grown to dread returning to my apartment.

Two nights before the gallery opening, I found my answer. Or, at least, a semblance of one. It was in a book retelling old legends and folktales of Venice. The book was so old the binding was practically falling apart, the pages yellow and stiff. The story was written in Italian, so I’ll translate and summarize it here.

*The Curse of Il Rosso*

*The painter Selvaggio was one of the greatest in the city. The rich and powerful adored his skilled and sensual paintings. But there was one thing he was missing- a proper muse. A rare beauty would elevate his work to new heights.*

*He found one in a youth who became known as “Il Rosso:” a captivating young man with red hair. The young man’s origins are a mystery, but Selvaggio soon became obsessed. He moved the boy into his artist’s studio and started using him as a model.*

*With Il Rosso as a subject, Selvaggio created some of the greatest paintings of his career. He made twelve in all, each more beautiful than the last. But with each painting Selvaggio’s obsession became darker. He became terrified that Il Rosso’s beauty would fade. Selvaggio could not stand the thought of the youth getting older, and his looks being marred by time. So one night, while Il Rosso slept, Selvaggio crept into his room and smothered him to death with a pillow. That way, Il Rosso would be eternally young and beautiful.*

*Since then, it has been said that the twelve paintings have been cursed. Some have said that Il Rosso’s spirit has been split twelvefold, trapped in each of the paintings. When they are united, he gains the ability to reach into our world. He haunts the individuals who are the most captivated by him, and some have said that he drives them mad. Eventually, the person will disappear, never to be seen again.*

This had to be it. Three weeks ago, I would have dismissed it as a weird old fairy tale. But it made too much sense. I was the one captivated by him. I was obsessed with finding out who he was. And now he was haunting me. He said he was lonely and needed a friend. He mistook my curiosity for desire, and now he was planning to take me away.

I needed to talk to Dr. Clark. The whole thing sounded insane, but he was the only one who might have been able to understand. 

My first impulse was to call him immediately. But aside from the late hour, there was too much of a risk of him getting freaked out and hanging up. I had to wait until we could talk in person and alone.



The next day was the final day before the gallery opening. Despite our two weeks of work, we were still ridiculously busy. By the time I got Dr. Clark alone, it was late at night, long after the other workers had gone home. We were taking a final stroll through the gallery, making sure everything was perfect. 

I wasn’t quite sure how to broach the subject. Things had been icier between us since our argument the other day. But tonight he seemed to be in a good mood- all warm smiles and witty remarks. His demeanor made me optimistic.

I wound up telling him everything- my research, the haunting, and finally, my discovery in the library. Shockingly, he didn’t freak out or question my sanity. He didn’t even seem that surprised. In contrast, I got more and more breathless with every sentence. I felt like an enormous clock was hanging from my neck, each tick bringing me closer to doom. Finally, I cried, “You have to help me to stop him!”

I stared up at him pleadingly, blood pulsing in my ears. Dr. Clark remained impassive. Eerily so, like he felt nothing at all. All he said was, “It’s too late.”

“What?” I gasped. 

“Il Rosso has chosen you. Once he’s picked someone– his new ‘friend,’ as he calls them, there’s nothing we can do to stop him.”

I backed away as if I’d been scalded. “Wait- you *knew?* You knew about the curse?”

He smiled bitterly. “Of course I did. I’m an expert on Selvaggio, after all.”

There was an avalanche of questions tumbling from my brain to my lips, but only one came out. “What will happen to me?”

Dr. Clark led me to one of the paintings. *The Fall of Rome*. “See that dark-haired woman?”

I did. She was a pretty woman with olive skin and full lips. She huddled next to Il Rosso as they cowered from falling rubble. 

“The twelve paintings were displayed together for a short period in the 1780s. There was a maid at the gallery who became obsessed with Il Rosso. One day, she vanished. That same day, this woman appeared.”

He led me to another painting, featuring merry-faced musicians. He pointed to a middle-aged man holding a mandolin. “He was an assistant to a coal baron in the 1890s. The baron used much of his fortune to hunt down every Il Rosso painting. But the assistant disappeared shortly after completing the private collection.”

Dr. Clark turned to me. My mouth hung open in horror, but he didn’t seem to notice. “You could say that Il Rosso demands… payment for his services. Maybe he gets lonely. Maybe he’s out for revenge. But every time twelve are collected, he takes someone.” Dr. Clark peered down at my trembling frame. “We art historians have to keep him happy. Give him someone who doesn’t matter.”

I choked out, “But- but this is insane! How many people have been stolen? Those paintings should be destroyed!” 

Dr. Clark laughed- a sharp, barking sound. “Really, Effie? I thought you were an art historian! These paintings are priceless.”

“Why bring them together, then? Why put someone’s life at risk? Why *me?*” My voice broke on the final word. I suddenly felt so tiny, so pathetic. So expendable.

He sighed. “As I said before, Effie. Sometimes great art requires sacrifice.”

*“You bastard!”* I screamed, lunging at him. I didn’t know what I planned to do- just attack and escape. But with ease he swept me aside. My head hit the wall, and I crumpled to the floor like a rag doll. Pain exploded in my skull, and for a split second everything went completely black. When I came to, I could see Dr. Clark looming over me. He was twice my size, easily. I didn’t stand a chance.

As I struggled to my feet, I noticed something. One of the paintings was empty. It was once a solo portrait of Il Rosso dressed up as Bacchus. And the painting next to it, of the musicians- there was an empty space where Il Rosso used to be. I stumbled away from Dr. Clark, towards the door, when a figure stopped me in my tracks.

It was tall and thin, rippling and wobbling like a mirage. No- like an oily liquid trying desperately to hold its shape. Paint dripped off the creature and into red and gold puddles on the floor. I couldn’t see its face- the yellowed paint was so intense, so vibrant, that it felt like looking into the sun. Its hair formed a crimson halo around its head. 

Dr. Clark came up behind me. “He’s ready for you. Don’t make this any harder than it needs to be.”

Il Rosso grabbed my wrist, yellow-white oil seeping into my sleeve. With a scream I shook his arm off and rushed past him, bolting out the door.

I ran through the museum, screaming for help. It was completely empty. True, it was well after closing time, but there weren’t even security guards. I ran so fast my lungs screamed with pain, but I should still hear them behind me- Dr. Clark’s heavy footsteps, and horrible squelching sounds from Il Rosso. I reached the front doors only to find them locked. I had no choice but to retreat further into the museum.

I ran into the basement, only to find that I was utterly lost. I could still hear those monsters behind me, meaning I was now trapped. I burst through a door that turned out to be a bathroom. At first I thought I’d been cornered- until I saw the window. It was high up, almost at the ceiling, opening just a few inches above the street. It would have been too small for Dr. Clark to fit through, but I could probably make it. 

I locked myself in the stall below and stood on the toilet to reach it. Just then the bathroom door slammed open. I could see Il Rosso’s paint running down the bathroom tiles.

Thank God, the window unlocked from the inside. I undid the latch and cranked it open. Somehow, I managed to haul myself up and halfway through. My hands scrambled for purchase on the flat pavement.

I felt something grab my ankle. It was too solid to be Il Rosso- it had to be Dr. Clark. He probably crawled under the stall door while I was distracted. I swiveled myself around and braced my hands against the outside wall, trying to push myself out instead. 

Dr. Clark was panting and red in the face. “There’s no point in running from Il Rosso,” he said through gritted teeth, “He’ll always get what he wants.”

I glanced at that bright, melting abomination, and the monster pulling me towards it. I felt a sudden burst of hatred burn through me like a blast of lightning. “You want a new friend?” I shouted at Il Rosso, “Well, here he is!” I used my free leg to kick Dr. Clark in the face. His glasses broke on impact, and he fell backwards with a scream. I pushed myself out the window and crawled backwards onto the street.

I couldn’t see much from that tiny window. But it looked like Il Rosso was holding Dr. Clark by the ankles and dragging him across the floor. Dr. Clark was pleading with him- first to go after me instead, then offering other people to sacrifice, then just for mercy. I couldn’t tell if the red stains on his suit were paint or his own blood. They finally disappeared through the door, which slammed shut behind them.

I don’t remember much from the rest of the night. I vaguely remember taking a cab back to my apartment and limping to bed. In my dreams I was screaming, trying to claw my way out of a pit of golden oil and blood.



I was jolted awake the next morning by my phone ringing. It was a frantic call from the museum director. Apparently, Dr. Clark hadn’t shown up to prep for that day’s opening, and wasn’t answering his phone. So, I slipped gloves over my scraped-up hands, chugged a ginger ale to fight my nausea, and went to the opening. Partially out of obligation and partially out of curiosity. 

The opening went pretty smoothly, even if Dr. Clark wasn’t there. Il Rosso was back in all of his paintings. They looked untouched, except for one- *Jesus in the Temple*. It was always a chaotic image, showing Jesus chasing out the merchants corrupting a holy place. One of the merchants hadn’t been there before: a middle-aged man with a salt-and-pepper beard. He was wide-eyed, his mouth open in a scream.

When I got home I had a new note.

*Miss Effie Briones-* 

*Thank you for giving me a new friend. I am no longer so lonely. I owe you a great favor now.* 

*Il Rosso*

I had a sense this was not a favor I wanted to call in anytime soon. 

Within a few days it became clear that Dr. Clark was truly missing. The NYPD asked me a lot of questions, as I was the last person to see him alive. I told them that we finished up prepping for the exhibit that night, and I left the museum before he did. Weirdly enough, there apparently *were* security guards placed there that night- but none of them remembered anything unusual. Security camera footage from that night was entirely static. Dr. Clark’s unsolved disappearance was a huge disappointment to the field of art history. But then the exhibition was completed, Selvaggio’s paintings were scattered again, and the world moved on. 



And me? I’m back at my small-town college in Jersey. I still haven’t lost my passion for art history. But when people offer me condolences for my mentor’s disappearance, I never know what to say. I can’t tell whether I should still hate him, or feel guilty for my hand in his terrible fate.

My feelings for Il Rosso are even more complicated. After all that, I still don’t know anything about him. I don’t know who his family was, or how he met Selvaggio. I don’t know if his murderer was ever brought to justice. I never even learned his name. In spite of all he’s done, I can’t help but feel sorry for him. His beautiful face literally wound up being the death of him. And now his soul was split apart and trapped, in the very paintings that led to his murder. He became a footnote to history. I wonder if the emotions I read in his eyes- sadness, despair, loneliness- were Selvaggio’s invention, or the result of hundreds of years of pain. 

I’m posting as a warning. I’m reluctant to trust the art history community- who knows how many other people knew about Il Rosso, and brought him sacrifices? But maybe, just maybe, those of you reading will learn the right lesson. Don’t unite the Il Rosso paintings. Keep them as far away from each other as possible. Don’t look into his story- he might target you next. And if you manage to get ahold of one of his paintings, destroy it.  Great art be damned.

This brings me to today. I was flipping through one of my textbooks when I saw him again. This time, he was lingering in the background of a Victorian ball. Even in the crowded scene, the red hair and dark eyes were unmistakable. But this time, he was smiling.

So... I've passed out a few times? Was triggered by reading too much medical info, getting scared, and passing out. Usually drinking water helps but once I passed out at like 3am at my desk and I woke up, my parents tried to help but i felt like I had locked in syndrome for a bit and they said they never heard me try and say anything. I remember this haze of colorful dots... happened a couple more times for the same reason. (watching medical content)

At night I used to (?) have just twitches pretty frequently, I fall asleep fast though and havent noticed them in a while. Theres been times where my brain will just pause momentarily... like a silent clap taking my attention and occasionally I've straight up had the inability to think straight I've also been hearing voices and stuff sometimes... usually random peoples voices in languages I frequently use... different genders people ect.... was working out once and my brain started telling me there was someone in the lamp...

and i'm going to bring it up to a therapist. I had alot of rationalizations as to how it was some entity and such... i had moments where they tried to speak to me directly or it was a sick familly member trying to communicate.

And... I felt weird before it happened... looking back on it. Like looking back on it I felt off in some way. I feel fine right now and feel like hteres 0 chance it would happen.

I've been working out, I quit coffee, I've been moody but otherwise fine (however admittedly I was sitting at my desk and just heard very faint whispers in English and Polish weirdly (I was listening to a lot of Polish songs).

I've also had moments where this image of an eye was stuck moving in my field of vision faintly. Right in the center for like 20 min.

I'm feeling fine otherwise at this moment looking back on everything. (my parents suspected epelipsy once but they're worried I won't be allowed to drive if i get it checked out... tbf I live in the US and i cant rely on public transportation at all. )

This one time I passed out and was just uncontrollably kickiing and in my mind whenever i closed my eyes there was this dream? other set of images? just playing and I remember alot of fear or some other emotion I cant describe like I was stuck then I vomited alot like the other times.

\- 3:00 - Access to the venue, get to the bride & groom suites

\- 3:30 - First Look, Bridal Party Photos

\- 4:00 - Photographer gets B-roll/ceremony details pictures. Bridal party hides from guests and have snacks in their suites.

\- 4:30 - Guests start arriving

\- 5:00 - What we told guests the start time was (my family is *always* late)

\- 5:30 - Ceremony actually begins

\- 6:00 - Ceremony ends, cocktail hour begins. Docents available for tours of the historic home venue. Family photos.

\- 6:45 - Grand Entrance/Bridal Party Introduction. Champagne Toast.

\- 7:00 - Dinner Starts. BM/MOH Speeches. Bride & Groom visit tables to thank guests (instead of a receiving line)

\- 7:50 - Cake Cutting

\- 8:00 - First Dance, Parent-Child Dances, Anniversary Dance

\- 8:15 - Dessert/coffee is served. Open Dancing (with \~15 minutes of polka for the old folks to start, while everyone else is getting cake) \*9:00 - Degen Hour/the real party songs

\*no amplified music after 10pm\*

\- 11:00 - Reception officially ends, everybody out. Clean up

\- 12:00 - Clean up ends, everybody out for real this time.

My concern is that it isn't enough time for dancing. I'll happily get rid of the polka if my grandma doesn't come (she's on the fence since she'd have to travel), but this will probably be her last wedding and she loves polka dancing.

If Spiderman Brand New Day is it's own movie taking place before Doomsday and is not a multiverse movie and if Spiderman is not in Doomsday. The post credit scene can be Peter with MJ and Ned still trying to rekindle his relationship with them. As they're hanging out at some bar or coffee shop the scene cuts to moments before Doom or The Beyonder creates Battleworld in Doomsday. Doom casts a spell similar to the one Dr Strange casted and it undoes the magic the world or universe has used or created and that includes Peter's memory wipe spell.

As the trio are talking MJ and Ned pauses and Peter is confused and they look at Peter and tell him and remember everything with tears. Peter is visibly confused but also happy his GF and BFF finally remember but before they can hug each other, a loud cracking noise can be heard and the ground shakes and the trio runs outside and see a similar cracked sky like the one seen in NWH. Peter wonders what the hell is going on and those cracks starts to physically spawn people and objects from different universes around NY. Cameo ideas: Tobey and Andrew or any of the villains who fought spiderman in live action returns, never before scene in live action characters, or newly remakes of ones we've seen, animated characters. Mayhem erupts and NY is just in total chaos. Camera switches to the trio focusing on Peter and then we get a classic MCU ""What the Fu-"" Spiderman ending and then black screen with title saying ""Spiderman will be back.""

I think a second post credit scene should be showed and it would be about the symbiote Eddie and Venom left behind in NWH. Either it's been taken into a lab for study by some organization or it's bonded with something or someone.",3,1744067989.0,MCUTheories,0,1.0,False

I’ve slightly zoned out at this point until I hear one guy (much older man which is slouched across his sofa, laptop resting on a coffee table) call out ‘naked woman on the left’.

After about 5 whole seconds of pin drop silence the instructor says in the most monotone voice ‘well that’s not funny is it’.

Lately, it’s been harder to find someone to talk to freely. I'm a latino, so expect attention from my side...

My actual job is to prepare for things to go wrong, which is fitting because my brain kind of does the same thing, ""Always flirting with chaos and Issues."" I’ve got a nerdy side, a love for deep conversations, and a dark sense of humor. I'm always also in a light mood, but most of all, I'm in need of a connection that might keep me going. On the surface, I stay optimistic, but deep down, I wrestle with that quiet nihilism that makes it hard to see the point sometimes.

I guess I’m just looking for a friend or someone to talk to on a daily basis—someone who can talk about life, share random thoughts, and maybe help each other find a little more light in the mess. No pressure, no weirdness, no NSFW, just good conversations and a reminder that the world isn’t as isolating as it feels.

A little about me:

🔹 Tech geek by day, engineering specialist (both digital and personal) by night.

🔹 Sometimes sarcastic, witty, and a firm believer that memes are a love language.

🔹Cooking and making coffee is the way to know the other one.

🔹 Music taste? Industrial, metal, reggaeton, jazz and whatever fits the mood.

🔹 Into gaming (when i have time), horror movies from time to time, and fixing things most people would just replace.

🔹 A fan of waking someone up with a deep phrase or a simple good morning poem.

🔹 Big fan of deep, weird, and unfiltered conversations—sometimes geeky but mostly emotionally charged with poetry maybe.

What I’m looking for:

👉 Someone between these ages (26-45) who can enjoy good conversations and morning messages.

👉 Nerdy, goth, alternative, or just someone with their own unique spark.

👉 Bonus points if you like gaming, cooking, tech, horror, or just being delightfully weird.

If any of this resonates, send me a message; let's dive into a crappy chat for some time, since ghosting seems to be the way of Reddit. Usually talk by Discord/Whatsapp if that fits the coms requirements.

This might be an out there request but my old tumblr blog reminds me a lot of what I am looking for. 

I have been searching for a year round signature scent. Ideally I am imagining a feeling being an artsy photographer in the 90s in a southern European/ Moroccan city after a late summer/ autumn rain. I like the idea of a spicy citrus that can work in the summer and winter. My only requirement is that it has to last more than an hour or two. 

I am also looking for an additional perfume for date night. A strong spice and coffee smell would be prefect but I would like it to be feminine. A lot of what I have tried for an evening scent seems either too masculine or too sweet. 

Thanks for humoring my crazy in advance!

1jtz3w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1jtz3w5/is_this_financial_abuse_or_am_i_way_too_sensitive/,Is this financial abuse or am I way too sensitive? My (32m) Fiancé took away his bank card from me(28f) after an argument.,"Background. 28 f living with 32 m fiance. Together for 3 years. We share our gorgeous dog,, have an apartment together ( renting) and share a car. He makes $72,000 plus $7,000 bonus per year and I make approx $47,000. Recently, half of my wages goes into savings for us and the other half goes towards medical bills and 1/3rd rent ( I have chronic health issues) so we use his salary to live on. As such, I have one of his cards if i want to get a coffee, get lunch, clothes etc. If it's an expensive purchase- over $70, I would always clear it with him.

We recently got into a fight. It started off when I was organising my passport renewal and the fee was $130. I dont have the money to pay this month but i would next month. He said he would loan me the money and i could pay him back. This annoyed me because 1) my father very generously gifted us $20,000 to help with a downpayment for a house. Recently, we borrowed $2000 of it to pay for the wedding venue as it's in my individual account. My partner said once he got his work bonus, he would put the $2000 we used for the wedding venue, back in my individual account as we aren't supposed to touch the mortgage money and he said he would pay for it and use his bonus for the wedding venue. That was fine and even though he received his bonus last month , he didnt transfer it back, but it didnt bother me because at least it was in one of our accounts and what's his is mine and whats mine is his etc. 2) We share money. I feel odd loaning money to him and vice versa because he has always said its our money. If he needed money, I would just give it to him, I'd never expect him to transfer it back, unless it was a larger sum. Maybe that's my issue.

Some more background:

(I have been doing most of the wedding planning. The one thing I asked my fiancé to do was to book the dog sitter. He didn't and they then ended up being booked out for that date because he didn't message them soom enough so they had to let the date go, which is frustrating. this happened two weeks ago)

I have a very important appointment tomorrow and he said he would print off and organise the paperwork I needed for it. I kept asking him all this week if he had done it and tonight I asked him again while i was filling out my passport form and he still did not do it. This caused the fight because I feel like I'm always doing everything. I plan the holidays, I planned the wedding, I found our apartment etc. Long story short, we got in a big fight. I told him i was done with all the planning. From here on out, he can do the rest of the wedding planning and that it is completely up to him ( in other words, if he doesnt organise it, theres no wedding) He got very defensive and said i literally took a day off work to take you to your doctors appointment and now i have loads of work to do and all evening you were coming in, bothering me. ( when he wfh, i do have a tendency to come into the home office and talk away when he is working which is something i am trying to work on. I cant help it because he works a lot so sometimes i miss him so i like going in to talk to him) This hurt my feelings because when I tell him that he has let me down in some way or I share my frustration over something he isn't doing, he always feels the need to list things he has done and one thing he always does is use the fact he brings me to my medical appointments which really hurts my feelings. In contrast, if he ever comes to me with something that is bothering him or if he feels like I am not doing enough of something, I will always make an effort to understand his perspective. 

He then said i want my card back, where is it? ( or something along those lines) I told him where it was and he took it. So i then said okay well then transfer dad's $2000 back to me if you're going to be like that. He did.

I told him that him asking for the card back could be financial abuse. Imagine if I was a stay at home mom and he was my only stream of income. He said that it's not financial abuse and that is merely a hypothetical because I work full time and I literally "" just gave you $2000, how is that financial abuse? "" I told him that's dads money that you're repaying. It's not like you're randomly giving me $2000 because you took the card back. We then argued some more.

What do you think? Am I being way too sensitive or is this just a normal fight? Or is there any aspect of abuse in this scenario? Maybe I am in the wrong and I'm the one being abusive??

Thank you, any help greatly appreciated.

1jtywck,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jtywck/would_this_be_considered_financial_abuse_or_am_i/,Would this be considered financial abuse or am I too sensitive?,"Background. 28 f living with 32 m fiance. Together for 3 years. We share our gorgeous dog,, have an apartment together ( renting) and share a car. He makes $72,000 plus $7,000 bonus per year and I make approx $47,000. Recently, half of my wages goes into savings for us and the other half goes towards medical bills and 1/3rd rent ( I have chronic health issues) so we use his salary to live on. As such, I have one of his cards if i want to get a coffee, get lunch, clothes etc. If it's an expensive purchase- over $70, I would always clear it with him.

We recently got into a fight. It started off when I was organising my passport renewal and the fee was $130. I dont have the money to pay this month but i would next month. He said he would loan me the money and i could pay him back. This annoyed me because 1) my father very generously gifted us $20,000 to help with a down payment for a house. Recently, we borrowed $2000 of it to pay for the wedding venue as it's in my individual account. My partner said once he got his work bonus, he would put the $2000 we used for the wedding venue, back in my individual account as we aren't supposed to touch the mortgage money and he said he would pay for it and use his bonus for the wedding venue. That was fine and even though he received his bonus last month , he didn't transfer it back, but it didn't bother me because at least it was in one of our accounts and what's his is mine and whats mine is his etc. 2) We share money. I feel odd loaning money to him and vice versa because he has always said its our money. If he needed money, I would just give it to him, I'd never expect him to transfer it back, unless it was a larger sum. Maybe that's my issue.

Some more background:

(I have been doing most of the wedding planning. The one thing I asked my fiancé to do was to book the dog sitter. He didn't and they then ended up being booked out for that date because he didn't message them soon enough so they had to let the date go, which is frustrating. this happened two weeks ago)

I have a very important medical appointment tomorrow and he said he would print off and organise the paperwork I needed for it. I kept asking him all this week if he had done it and tonight I asked him again while i was filling out my passport form and he still did not do it. This caused the fight because I feel like I'm always doing everything. I plan the holidays, I planned the wedding, I found our apartment etc. Long story short, we got in a big fight. I told him i was done with all the planning. From here on out, he can do the rest of the wedding planning and that it is completely up to him ( in other words, if he doesnt organise it, theres no wedding) He got very defensive and said ""i literally took a day off work to take you to your doctors appointment and now i have loads of work to do and all evening you were coming in, bothering me"". ( when he wfh, i do have a tendency to come into the home office and talk away when he is working which is something i am trying to work on. I cant help it because he works a lot so sometimes i miss him so i like going in to talk to him) This hurt my feelings because when I tell him that he has let me down in some way or I share my frustration over something he isn't doing, he always feels the need to list things he has done and one thing he always does is use the fact he brings me to my doctor appointments which really hurts my feelings.

He then said i want my card back, where is it? ( or something along those lines) I told him where it was and he took it. So i then said okay well then transfer dad's $2000 back to me if you're going to be like that. He did.

I told him that him asking for the card back could be financial abuse. Imagine if I was a stay at home mom and he was my only stream of income. He said that it's not financial abuse and that is merely a hypothetical because I work full time and I literally "" just gave you $2000, how is that financial abuse? "" I told him that's dads money that you're repaying. It's not like you're randomly giving me $2000 because you took the card back. We then argued some more.

What do you think? Am I being way too sensitive or is this just a normal fight? Or is there any aspect of abuse in this scenario? Maybe I am in the wrong and I'm the one being abusive??

I’m just starting the process of divorcing my husband as a SAHM. I was just hoping to hear from people who have gone through the same thing. I’m trying to find part time daycare at the moment so that I can at least find part time work. It’s hard finding places with openings on short notice. He was giving me around $300 per paycheck for personal spending money for the past few months but now he says that he can’t afford to do that. I was going to use that towards daycare but now it’s not an option. He’s been working a lot of overtime lately, so he hasn’t been helping with our daughter 99% of the time. He also has a lot of subscriptions for different things like coffee and other things he could live without, as well as spending money on TikTok and Amazon every time he gets paid. He says that giving me personal spending money is not a priority and he has no way to pay for even part time day care. I was trying to minimize the amount of savings I spent on the divorce but it seems like he’s not really giving me a choice at this point but to file and force him to pay.

1jtyvq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jtyvq0/persistent_breathing_issues_dry_mouth_heart/,"Persistent breathing issues, dry mouth & heart racing after single alcohol incident","On Christmas, I (18M) decided to drink a fair amount of alcohol (I never drink). Not even 10 minutes later, my heart started racing to around 150bpm. It stayed like this for 12 hours, and after this I had difficulty breathing.

Fast forward months later, I'm still experiencing:

* Constant yawning (can't get enough air even when yawning)
* Persistent difficulty breathing that only stops when I sleep and reappears randomly after waking up
* Severe and CONSTANT dry mouth on awakening that has not gone away for a single day since the incident
* Occasional dizziness and light-headedness (feels like I'm going to faint)
* Initially had lack of appetite that resolved after a few weeks
* One random episode of feeling really cold

I had a 2-week period where symptoms disappeared completely, which occurred about 3 weeks after they began. Then I suddenly started getting a bad coughing fit 2 hours after waking up, and all symptoms returned.

My digestive system has also been affected,  I've had alternating constipation and diarrhea, and recently noticed black specks (possibly seeds) in my stool.

I've been told this is probably anxiety, but I find it hard to believe since it's constant, every single day, and never happened before the alcohol incident. The only similar experience I've had is sometimes getting shortness of breath for a few hours after drinking coffee. My stress tolerance has drastically decreased, if I get even slightly scared, I feel like I'm going to faint.

Tests completed (all normal):

* Echocardiogram
* ECG
* Blood analysis
* Evaluation by a cardiologist who said symptoms are ""subjective""

Interestingly, two things have helped somewhat:

1. Probiotics seemed to improve my symptoms
2. A herbal supplement containing passion flower, valerian, lemon balm, California poppy, and melatonin also reduced symptoms

I've been looking into acetaldehyde sensitivity and the connection between alcohol, mucosal barrier damage, and chronic symptoms. Could this be a case where the alcohol triggered acetaldehyde buildup that damaged my mucosal barriers, leading to systemic effects including breathing issues and dry mouth?

I tried to start exercising to deal with the symptoms but could barely manage 2 minutes of HIIT on the first day. I also wake up with dry mouth every single morning.

Has anyone experienced anything similar or have any insights into this connection between alcohol, acetaldehyde, and persistent symptoms? What specialists should I see beyond cardiology?",1,1744066761.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

JOURNAL  

30/03/25  

I found these whilst clearing my house out, I think it’s an old journal I used to keep. They probably won’t be all that interesting. I just used to keep these to kill time. To be honest, I don’t really remember much from back then. Hopefully, you internet people will find something interesting in this.   

\-Mila  

04/12/08 

I’ve never been the type of person to keep a journal. I always procrastinate and forget to write in them. Hopefully, this will change that. I got this book yesterday; I might as well use it. By the way, my name is Mila. I’m 21, I live in (I'm not telling you where I live.), and I work in a rundown pub in the middle of town.

It was morning. After being rudely awoken by my alarm, I had forced myself to get up. I made some tea, got the bus, and after a dreary eight-minute drive, I was there. 

A half collapsing, dusty, red brick building. The pub. I swung open the door, Elle was sweeping dust off the red and green polygonal carpet, she smiled and waved at me, then continued sweeping, the sun outlining her long, messy blonde hair. Andy was attempting to carry a cardboard box labelled ‘DVDs’, he was wearing a pink and green Hawaiian shirt and some incredibly skinny jeans. He turned around to look at me, stared at me completely blank for a full five seconds, then spoke. 

“Can you help?” he asked, wiping some sweat off his forehead.

“Oh, sure.” I nodded, throwing my satchel and coat behind the bar, then walked over and helped him waddle it over to the fuzzy, glitching TV. “Why are we trying to bring it here anyway? The TV hasn’t worked since the Bonfire Night incident.” 

“Elle says she’s going to fix the TV at some point, right Elle?” he shouted at Elle, who was on the other side of the room, I heard her shout something, I couldn’t really make it out though. 

We put the box down, it made a very loud clunk. The TV made a noise, I’m pretty sure it laughed. I have no idea what those cultists did to that TV and why they had eighty-six virgins (Yes, I counted). I don’t think I want to know.  

The pub has been around since the 1600s. I do not believe this whatsoever, I don’t think a single person does. The pub was found literally overnight, much to the confusion of the town council, and to the people who used to live there.

Andy poked the TV, it hissed, flashed some random series of colours and images, then shut off. I think he’s balled up in the corner crying. What on earth did that TV show him? 

Not many people show up in the morning, which makes sense. There is the hat man, but he’s not a real person. I don’t think many people are real. There’re a few interesting people, there’s the Bear the hiker, conspiracy guy, and the paranormal investigators who keep coming in and forcing me to show them around at three in bloody morning!

I’m just waiting for my shift to end right now. It’s only a few minutes until then, so I've got that going for me. 

Mila, signing off. Elle’s yelling at me about a rat or something.  

UPDATE: It wasn’t a rat! It looked like a gnome or something, tried to eat at Elle’s shoe. Don’t worry, it got mopped and scurried away. Hopefully more won’t show up. I’m keeping my shoes safe until we’re sure though. Just in case.  

09/12/08  

“There’s a portal in the bathroom.”

“What?”  I stopped sweeping, spinning around, stumbling backward a bit, and then looking at Elle. Her hair was still blonde as always, eyes were still green. Yep, it’s probably still her.   

“Portal, in the bathroom.”   

I sighed, leaning the mop against the wall and rubbing my temples in frustration, then following behind her to the bathroom. I had to twiddle the handle a few times before nearly pulling the door off the hinges and falling back against the wall.  

“where’s the portal...?”   

Elle pointed at a metre-wide hole in the ground, the bathroom was so small it took up most of the room. Warm air was drifting out from inside.

“What’s down there?”  I walked up to the hole, kneeling to look in  

“Albuquerque.”  

“Albuquerque? Like, the city?”  

“Yes Mila, the city.”  

I poked my head through, sticking out into a random Sonic parking lot, then turning back around to Elle.  

“What do we do?”  

“Uh...”  

She paced around for a moment, then stopped to say something, only coming out as a gasp, then a hum.  

“The tarp! You know, the one we used to cover up that hole with the Cheerio box with the eyes?”  

“Oh yeah, I forgot about that...” 

Elle ran off somewhere, leaving me alone with the Albuquerque hole. Then the screaming started. A few individual and distant screeches then erupted into a cacophony of noise as hundreds, maybe thousands of voices began emitting a high-pitched screech from inside the hole. About a dozen different human arms and legs of various lengths and body types reached out of the hole pulling up, something.  

A huge, lumbering mass of pasty white flesh and various human limbs flopped onto the bathroom tiles with a slimy thump. Wrapping its limbs around the sink and ripping it off, one of countless, buggy eyes stared at me. Studying me. It let out a dry whimper. Its chest, or chests, ripped open, a mouth forming from its flesh. It’s hundreds of ribs ripped through it’s ‘lips’ and crunched together. Forming teeth. The full bodies of people formed a tongue and rough, papery flesh formed inside.   

I sighed, walking over to the storage closet, I heard the thing trying to chase me from behind. There were a few things inside the closet, another mop, some bleach, a few bottles of washing-up liquid, and a crowbar. A weapon.  

The crowbar slammed against the thing, it let out a grumble, more bored than anything. Then slammed a bloated arm against my body, sending me tumbling through the air and smacking against the ceiling. Falling onto the carpet. It slumped forward towards me and started pulling itself up to me. I tried to get up, but my leg collapsed underneath me, the bone snapping with a sickened crunch and I fell onto the ground.   

Elle, who just so happened to walk in holding the tarp physically jumped back a few feet, if I wasn’t about to be eaten by a swollen mass of human limbs, I might’ve laughed.  

“Oh, crap!”  

She threw the tarp at it, which seemed to melt into the creature. Still barely visible underneath its skin. It looked at her like a toddler looks at an ant, tilting its heads at her in confusion. She threw a chunk of the wall at it, the brick seemed to do more damage than the crowbar, causing a barely visible bruise and making the creature emit a low grumble.  

“Shit, where’s Andy?”  

“He went to...ngh...shops...” I managed to get out, still reeling from the pain.

The door burst open; Andy walked in holding a new copy of Diary of a Wimpy Kid in his left hand and a six-pack of discounted beer in the other. He looked around for a moment, searching the room for me, then finally spotting the huge flesh creature.   

“What’s uhm... what’s that?”  

“I-I don’t know? It just showed up!”  

“From WHERE!?” he threw a few pint glasses at it, it slowly lumbered towards him, each laboured movement causing it to wheeze and sputter, occasionally shivering and freezing up.  

“Albuquerque!”  

“That’s in America, and how’d it even get in here? It’s huge!”  

“FLOOR!” she threw a piece of splintered wood from the wall at it, the creature let out a scream, or screams. Hundreds of voices all joined together in pain. It crashed its body against the wall and fell through, landing on a piece of broken concrete wall, the supports stabbing through its back. It spat out some blood, and its eyes rolled back. And it was over. Quickly, surprisingly quickly. It was dead.  

“What the...what the hell...” Andy panted, leaning against the counter, then looking at the wall the creature fell through, which was slowly regenerating. The brick and concrete grew back as the beast’s body dissolved into a small puddle of black goo. Elle lifted me, then walked over to Andy, grabbing his arm and dragging him to the bathroom to show him the Albuquerque portal.   

“It came out from there.”  

“The hole? How’d that thing even get out it’s like a metre wide tops...”  

I pushed my hands together slowly, making a bad deflating noise as I did.   

“Smaller, it got...it got smaller.”  

“Huh, neat.” He looked down into the hole “What do we do with it?”  

“Well, I used the tarp up, so I think we should just pretend the toilet’s clogged or something...”  

I think I blacked out around here from the blood loss. Convenient, right? Now I don’t have to write anything more. (My pen’s nearly out of ink anyway.) When I woke up, Elle was toasting bits of bacon over the fireplace, whilst Andy was telling her about some ghost he saw the other day.  

As for my leg, it still hurts. A lot, like A LOT a lot. We can’t get any cell service from in here, so no ambulance. At least for a while. Elle wrapped some wet paper towels around it, but it was still bleeding. Somehow. It’s nice being alone with her, well mostly alone, Andy is half asleep and groggily trying to make some coffee in the bar whilst flipping through the book he got. She also finally managed to get the TV working, thank God, and she put me on one of the sofa chairs. I might just sleep here. She’s asleep already. Fell asleep about an hour ago when she ran out of hypotheticals to ask me. She’s nice to be around like that. She talks and I listen.   

Talk to you tomorrow journal.  

12/12/08  

After my leg got completely and utterly obliterated, Andy begrudgingly agreed to take my shift if I gave him my copy of Hot Fuzz. But now it’s back to work for lil ol’ me, nothing’s happened, yet. There is that woman in the bloody wedding dress who’s floating an inch off the floor, but she comes in here every two days and orders the same gin every two days. She’s on one of the slot machines right now.  

“Hey, are you real?”  

“Huh?” Her eyes shifted over to me, then back to the slot machine. She slammed her fist against it in anger, presumably she just lost 2 quid.  

“Are you like, a living person?”  

She chuckled, spinning around.  

“Oh no, I don’t think so at least.”  

I raised an eyebrow  

“You don’t think so?”   

“Have you seen my husband?” 

“...no? I don’t think so at least.” she took a medieval mace out from, somewhere, and slammed it onto the bar counter, sending some wood splinters into my face, which bounced off my face and onto the floor. “Agh! God, why do you have a mace!?”  

“I am the widow of the well, master of souls, the terror of Roby, and the scourge of all things holy! Your soul is mine, Hoffman! Prepare for your DOOM!” she swung her cartoonishly large battle mace at me, which grazed my shirt slightly, but the force nearly knocked me off my feet anyway. Andy yelled something at me from across the room, probably with no relation to the mace-wielding ghost attacking me. I reached under the counter, grabbing a spray bottle with a cross lazily scratched on it. Then pointed it at her. “What, what on earth is that...” she looked at the bottle, raising an eyebrow, her accent faltering slightly. I tried squirting it. Empty. We really need to get more holy water.

“Why...why are you trying to kill me...!?” I said, half panting and still reeling from the shock of having a battle mace nearly lodged into my cranium. She sighed.   

“Too many questions, not enough soul consuming.” She tried to wack me with the mace again.  

“Christ, stop! My legs are already broken, I don’t need my head smashed!” I threw a bottle of brandy at them. She made a light oof and fell to the ground unconscious. I looked over the counter, why is everything that comes in here so conveniently weak? That giant limb monster only took a piece of rebar to kill it, and now the ghost? It weirded me out. That’s when Elle finally arrived.  

“Hey, Mila! How’s your...oh my-” she looked down, then kicked the unconscious lady’s head lightly with her foot “Is she...Is she dead?” she looked down, noticing the large wound in her chest.  

“Kinda? I think she’s a ghost.” I hobbled over. She sighed.  

“I’ll go get the shovel, we’re running out of places to bury these things, Mila.”  

“I know, but what else are we supposed to do?”  

“We could let her wake up?” She knelt, picked up the battle mace, and handed it to me to put behind the counter  

“Then what? We don’t even know her motives. She could start attacking us again.” I protested, Elle sighed, attempting to pick up the ghost, but her arms went straight through her  

“What the...How’d it even get hurt by the brandy bottle if it’s a ghost?” I still don’t have an answer to that one. Andy, who was chain-smoking cigarettes and lying on a table chimed in.  

“Why don’t we shut up, forget about her and watch something. Elle fixed the TV, and we haven’t even used it since Monday!” He sat up, then hopped off the table, walking to the TV and flicking a few switches, I wasn't sure he knew what any of them did.

Elle spent the next 10 minutes trying to get rid of the ghost, she eventually woke up of course, but she just seemed sad and asked for a beer. I think she’s on the slot machine again. Andy eventually figured out the TV controls and managed to put on some local TV channel. It's mostly news, apparently there was an explosion last night. Out deep in the woods. It's probably nothing to worry about. 

Elle says she wants to put up a Christmas tree tomorrow. So, I’ve got that to look forward to. She was driving me home at the time. The orange street lights were slowly fading into the cavernous darkness of the woods, I could've worn I saw shining yellow eyes in the forest. Everyone does. There's something out there, that's for sure. 

“Watcha writing?” she glanced at me for a moment, then back at the road.

“Oh, it’s just...it’s nothing.”  

“Well, it’s not nothing. I have eyes, you know?” She fiddled with the radio, occasionally looking at my journal. I really don’t like when people look through my stuff. I’m always scared I wrote something stupid in the moment and forgot to get rid of it.  

“It’s just my journal  

“Oh! That’s nice, what do you write in it?”  

“Stuff.”  

“Stuff?”  

“Yeah, just...stuff.”  

“Have you written about me?” she put on a high school musical mean girl voice.  

“Oh, no! No, no uh, why would I ever do that?” I said, lying through my teeth.   

The car screeched to a stop. There was moose in the road, in the middle of the Lincolnshire countryside, there was a 7-foot-tall moose just...there. Then, it stood up. It stared at us for a good 30 seconds, it strolled up to our car like a person, bending down next to my window to look in, it knocked on my window with its hoof. I lowered the window. Then it meowed, not like a cat, more like someone pretending to be a cat. It stared at me with its cold, black eyes. I stared back for a moment, then it started meowing again. I rolled up the car window. Elle obviously got the message and started driving.  

After about another twenty minutes of driving in silence (mostly silence anyway, Elle had put on Linkin Park a while ago), we finally arrived at my flat. It was dark outside; the streets were a yellowish orange from the streetlights.  

“I’ll see you tomorrow Elle...” I turned around to her, smiling weakly. She smiled back, then waved. Getting back into her car and driving off.   

I’m probably going to go to bed, it’s getting late. My clock’s broken though, so I’m just guessing.  

Goodnight.  

13/12/08 

After around two hours of sleep? (I think? Like I said, my clock’s broken.) I went through my normal morning routine: wake up, shower, clean up my face a bit, tea, and the bus. A pretty average day so far. Andy had found an old, dusty digital camera earlier that day. I don’t know how he gets here so early. 

“Come on, we have to film SOMETHING with it!” He said, spinning the camera around in his hand. 

“I am not going into the woods. We don’t know what could be out there.” Elle looked down at him, clearly unimpressed. 

“But we could film it, put it on YouTube!” he protested, pointing the camera at Elle’s face and zooming it in. 

“You sound like every found footage protagonist to ever exist. I don’t want to get Blair Witched for YouTube.” 

“You’re no fun Elle, Mila you agree, right?” 

I looked over at them, I had been too busy trying to fix a picture frame that had fallen off the wall with super glue to be all that invested in the conversation. 

“I don’t mind; I could use a break from the madness.” I put the super glue down, walked over to the coat hanger, and grabbed my stuff. Andy was ecstatic to get off work for a while. Elle on the other hand, looked mortified. 

Andy opened the door and walked out into the street, inhaling a deep breath and then violently coughing from the fumes. It smelt like rot, shit, and petrol. Like any other well-respecting English town, the smell of natural fertilizer (cow crap) wafted through the air and hung like a stinking fog.  

After making sure Andy wasn’t actually dying, we decided to head into a corner shop to grab some supplies. 

“Should we get one or two packs of digestives?” Elle looked down at the packets, then handed them to me, I put them in the basket. 

“Isn’t two a bit excessive? We only have £5.” I grabbed one of the packets, throwing it in between my hands as Elle began to talk. 

“Well, we might as well. Andy ate like three packets in an hour after the Albuquerque incident...”  

After wandering around the corner shop for another few minutes, we decided to get going. It was about midday by now, the thin veil of snow shone in the bright sun, and the forest was completely leafless, well maybe a few evergreens here and there, but mostly greyish brown nets of branch. 

Andy was a few metres in front of me and Elle, he was recording various things with the camera, pointing it out into the darkness of the forest occasionally. He stumbled over something, then looked behind him. There was a huge femur half submerged into the ground, various mushrooms and plants grew out from the side and tangled over the seemingly ancient bone. What was weirder is that it was just a femur, nothing else. I would've expected a full skeleton. It’s probably not important though, I’m sure whatever elder God that bone belonged to shouldn’t be much of a problem anymore.

The orange evening sun crept through the trees, and we were quite frankly, very lost. I could swear I could see figures shifting in and out of the tree line, running, staring. A man walked out of the treeline, his movements were fast and unnatural, sporadic, his limbs and extremities were bent out of shape and disfigured. Boils and rashes covered his body, leaking a yellowish puss that stuck to his skin.  

He turned around, the wrinkled skin on his face looked like it was melting. Drooping off in long flaps of flesh. He shouted something in... Spanish? Maybe? I don’t know, I couldn’t make out the language, then began chasing after us. Andy ran off into the woods, Elle darted into a ditch, the creature seemed more occupied with Andy, so I dropped into the ditch with Elle. I heard some shouting in the distance, some screaming, things snapping, crunching.  

As far as I was concerned, me and Elle were as good as dead. I knew that at any moment, that thing could appear, and kill us both.  

“Hey, Elle?” I looked over at her, my head hurt from the constant fear, and my leg throbbed with a sharp, stabbing pain. 

“Yeah?” 

“What’s it like?” 

“What’s what like?” 

“Being normal.” 

“You’re pretty normal, in my opinion. No offense.” 

“I’m not.” 

“What, why?”  

I feel like she was just trying to be nice, I’m not normal in many aspects. I didn’t answer.  

She looked out of the ditch. 

“Is it still out there?”  

The rustling and movement we had heard throughout the night had been gone for about an hour.  

“We could probably make a run for it...” I added. 

“Too risky. We could try sneaking?” 

“This thing probably knows the forest better than anything else. It’s at an advantage in every way...” 

I nodded. 

“Well, we can’t just stay out here forever, right?” 

She thought for a moment, then grabbed my hand. 

“Just, stay with me.” 

I nodded. 

What followed was about an hour of stumbling through the forest, trying not to scream whenever something made a noise behind us, and attempting to look for Andy. We found him hidden behind a tree, his shirt was ripped up and muddy. I'm just happy nobody died.

We made it out of those woods, thankfully, I’m writing from my room. I have no idea what the time is. I should get some sleep. 

Mila, going to bed.  

14/12/08  

I woke up to someone banging on my door in the middle of the night. There were some muffled shouts, some loud bangs, and then silence. By the time I had come down to see what had happened, there was nothing. Only a few shotgun shells on the floor, and a few puddles of crimson blood. I didn’t call the police. They wouldn’t help. But I knew who could.  

“Hey, has Bear been here recently?” I looked over at Andy, who was washing some glasses  

“Huh, oh yeah. He’s over there.” He pointed at a half-awake Bear; he had a half drank a pint of Guinness next to him  

“Is he even awake...?”  

“I doubt it, he’s had three pints already.” Suddenly, Bear looked up, his beard was slightly stained a yellowish-brown  

“Hey, bear, uhm, do you know what this is...?” I handed him the shotgun shell, the golden rim shone under the humming fluorescent light.  

“It’s a 70mm. The Remington 870 uses those.” He got up, examining the shell like an archaeologist with some ancient artifact “Where did you find it?”  

“It was on the floor, outside my flat.” I looked at the shell, it was slightly muddy and stained from the blood. He handed it back to me and then smiled.  

“Stay safe, you never know who could be watching.” and with that, he walked off.  

“Wow, ominous,” Andy said, putting a pint glass in the cabinet  

“What do you think that’s about?”  

“My best guess is the dark lord Xylanoth that we found out was watching us last week, but that’s just me.” I had forgotten about that.  

“Well yeah, but there’s like 18 different things watching us.”

There was a crash from the other side of the room, Elle had dropped a Christmas decoration on the floor, she said about 30 different curse words I had never heard before in my life, walking over to the storage closet to grab the sweeper.   

“You good?” I asked, stupidly. Andy kicked my foot; something had obviously happened that I wasn’t aware of.  

“No, Mila, I am not 'good'!” She shouted from across the room, grabbing the sweeper and sweeping the broken glass into a corner, then throwing it onto the ground.  

“I’ll make you some tea...” I turned around, grabbing the tea bag tin from the cabinet, I heard Elle walking over to me from the Christmas tree, and grab my hand. I got caught off guard by her touch.  

“Can I talk to you for a moment?”  

“Huh, oh, uh...sure.” She dragged me to the storage closet, she’s stronger than she looks.   

“My mum was found missing last night.”  

“Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t kno-” She interrupted before I could finish.  

“No, Mila, it’s not that it’s...”  

“It’s what...?”  

“My mother is dead. She died three years ago.” That was when the breathing started. It was a quiet, muffled noise. It was coming from behind us. We turned around. There was an old woman. She was fused with the wall, her breathing was slowed, her eyes were closed, she looked...I don’t know, defeated? Her body was pale and covered in reddish growths and boils, her bones malformed to the point that they were completely unrecognisable.

“Is that...?” I turned to Elle, who was clearly not taking seeing her mother fused with a brick wall. Then again, I could never know what it was like. Seeing someone you love displayed in death in such a macabre way. Was she even dead? I don’t know if that would make it better or worse. Elle was visibly shaking and slowly backing away from the wall to the closet door. I walked backward towards the door and tried to open it. Locked. “Crap, it’s locked! What do we do?” Elle sputtered something I couldn’t make out, and I looked around for something, anything that could get us out. There was a knock at the door.  

“Can you guys hurry up with...whatever you’re doing? I need to get the detergent.” It was Andy.  

“Andy open the door!” I shouted, the wall mother was, I don’t know, growing? Or at the very least it was trying to get to us.  

“Are you alright? I heard some banging, and I came to check on you.”  

“We’re fine, just open the door!!” I slammed my fist against the closet door.  

“Okay, okay, jeez...” He tried at the door handle, it swung open, and I fell back, my leg (Which was still broken!) radiated shockwaves of pain, I think I broke it again.  

“Ah, God!” I grabbed my leg, still lying on my back, I looked over at Elle, who was still frozen in fear and grabbed her leg. “Elle! Elle!” I shook her leg.  

“Huh...” She backed up, nearly standing on my hair. Andy looked into the room, the person in the wall was dissolving. Her flesh was melting, thick slobs of red bile flopped onto the floor and hissed as the acids burnt into the floor. The woman's meat was covered in boils and foamed up, her eyes were bulging out of her face, dipping down her face and sliding down her chest. She didn't scream, didn't even seem worried. She just looked, at peace. Like she had accepted her fate.

“Is it...It’s digesting her.” Andy spoke softly; his voice was shaky. Disturbed.  

“What is?” I looked over at him, Elle was trying to help me up whilst I did.  

“The building, it’s eating her.” I thought for a moment; it didn’t seem too outlandish. In fact, I was kind of expecting the building to do this. That must be why the bodies keep disappearing, the pub was eating them.  

“So that must mean...”  

“The building’s alive.” He looked around, the walls seemed to pulsate, the cameras were locked on him like eyes.  

“Then why did it have my mum!?” Elle shouted, looking over at the spot where the old woman was. “I-It doesn’t make sense! Why did it have her!? How did it get her!?” She slammed her fist against the wall, her eyes were watery and red, her knuckles were now bruised from punching a solid brick wall.   

The building was alive, that’s why it wasn’t built! It grew! How alive was the building though? Is it fully conscious? It protects itself so it must have some form of intelligence. And Elle’s mother, how’d the pub get her? Honestly, we’d been left with more questions than answers from the whole ordeal. All I know now is that we’re never alone now. We’re constantly being watched; there’s no escape from it.   

I think I’ll look through the DVDs tomorrow, I need to take my mind off things.  

Mila going to sleep, hoping the beg bugs don’t bite.  

UPDATE: Something just meowed outside of my window. I don’t own a cat.  

15/12/08  

Elle seems happier today, she says she hasn’t told the police about her mother. They wouldn’t believe her anyway. She had a private funeral last night, to help her cope. I guess her mother will be missing forever.   

Anyway, some guys in suits came in today. Said they wanted a sample of the building. I thought it was weird but agreed. I haven’t seen them in a while, I did hear some screaming though, something about a sonic. I’m sure their fine. Probably.  

Andy managed to get the tree up whilst Elle worked at the bar. Whilst they were, I was looking through the DVD box.   

“Hey, how many do we have left?”  

“Huh? Oh like, fourteen. I think.” Andy answered.  

“Ah.” I sorted through them, there were the ones we had already watched, the wonderful ice cream suit, some cartoons, protect and survive (an old nuclear war PSA), and ghostbusters one & two. “What’s next?”  

“The Santa Clause I think...”  

“Why? That movie sucks.” Elle added from across the room, pouring some whisky for someone. Andy looked offended.   

“That’s Christmas heresy, Elle.”  

“So? Sue me, coward.”  

Andy grumbled something, then walked off to grab more Christmas stuff. We have A LOT of Christmas stuff.   

The silence was loud, me and Elle don’t talk much. Well, we do, but we’re really nervous around each other so it barely works. We’re either too awkward to talk to each other, or we talk for too long, and we forget we’re here to do a job. She’s the type of person who can talk for hours on end and still have something else to tell you about at the end of the day. She’s definitely my favourite person. Honestly, I’m in a complete mental hell about her. Sometimes I can’t get to sleep because I call her every night. I should really cut down on that. My phone bill’s getting out of hand.  

“Are you doing anything after work?” she asked.  

“Huh? Oh, no I don’t think so, I’m probably just gonna go to sleep. Probably. Yeah.”  

“Oh, well, I was gonna go to the park, but I don’t really want to go alone, you never know what could be out there. Especially around here.” I nodded, then stopped for a moment.   

“I wouldn’t mind going with you, but only if you want me to! I mean, you probably don’t want me to bu-”   

“Mila, shut up.” she interrupted, catching me off guard, then walked over to me and grabbed my shoulder. “Meet me at six. The park. Don’t be late. ’kay?”   

“Huh, oh, uh okay then...” 

The door swung open, it slammed against the wall, Elle let a scream, more of a screech, and fell backwards. In the doorway was a small, fat, 4 foot nothing blonde child with a ridiculously large rainbow lollipop, he had large goopy blue eyes, a blue and white striped shirt, brown overalls, cowboy boots, and a hat with a printed picture of a sheriff badge stapled to it on. He looked around for a moment, stared at me for about a minute, then spoke. He had a thick Texan accent and a much deeper voice than what belonged to him. 

“Howdy miss, get me some prairie dew and I’ll be outta here. Today’s been a doozy...” 

I walked over to the bar, the kid waddled over to the stool, his spurs clicking against the carpet, then pulled himself up. 

“Can I see some ID?” 

“Well, excuse me miss but I don’t got an ID. Too easy to track me, yew see?” 

I figured this was probably a ghost or something. 

“What’s prairie dew?” 

He sighed, dropping the Texas accent. 

“It’s whisky.” 

“Oh, figures. Are you over 18?” 

“Yeah? I’m forty-seven.” He put the Texan accent back on. I decided it was best not to question it and poured the drink for him. He drank it in a few seconds, jumped off the stool, then ran out onto the road and immediately got hit by a truck and was flung into the air, smacking his head against a lamppost and spraying his brains everywhere. His body fell to the ground with a sickly wet splat.

I’m pretty sure I just committed some form of manslaughter. 

So, as of now, I’ve got a few things to worry about. It’s ten minutes till 6. But there’s something outside my door. I don’t think it’s human. It’s meowing, shit is it that moose again? It keeps showing up, hang on.   

So, it WAS the moose. Well, the moose was here, anyway. It left before I went outside, convenient. Anyway, after the whole park thing (Which was very mushy and gross and would ruin the whole vibe I’m going for) the moose returned, except, it was different. Its skull was elongated and bent, it was completely hairless apart from some long, wiry hairs that dotted its head and back. Its antlers were grown out into hundreds of twisted, bony branches. Its teeth jutted out of its mouth and curled back into its lower jaw, and it was staring at me. It looked at me for a good eight to ten minutes, before it turned around, got on its hind legs, and strolled away into the woods. It doesn’t seem all that malicious, just a bit curious at most.  

So, quite a good day in my book. 

Mila, signing off.  

16/12/08

Woah, eight days till Christmas! Crazy, right? I’m weirdly optimistic today, for once it doesn’t feel like the world is about to end. Well, maybe it is, but I'm just going to ignore that for now. Ignorance is bliss, right?  

“Hey, Mila, do you remember the Albuquerque hole?” Andy asked, lying on the table he normally lies on.  

“Huh, yeah? Of course I do that’s how I broke my leg...” I looked down at my still broken leg, it was getting better, it still had a cast on it, it had been signed by a few people, and I think one of the gnomes has taken a bite out of it.  

“And you remember the suit guys?”  

“We get a lot of suit guys.”  

“The ones that went missing.”  

“We get a lot of suit guys that go missing.”  

“The ones from yesterday.”  

“OH, yeah, yeah what about them?”  

“I think they fell in the Albuquerque hole.”  

I sighed and got up, walking over to the bathroom, there was the hole. Still there, still a metre wide, and still a problem. I knelt, looked down into it, and was launched back by the body of one of the suit guys. If you haven’t come into contact with a dead body before (I hope most of you haven’t...), imagine a sandbag, now fill that sandbag with viscous fluids, smaller, squishier sandbags, and an unimaginable, strangely sweet stench that only the devil himself could concoct, and you might get an inch closer to what came out of that hole.  

I stumbled back, looking down at the body, some of his organs had tumbled out onto the tiled floor, and the stench was so overwhelming I was close to gagging.  

“Ah, Jesus! What, what the hell!?” I yelled, trying to kick away from the body.  

Andy had walked back into the hallway, I looked down, my clothes were surprisingly dry, and I looked back at the body. It was clear he had been rotting for a while, his flesh dangled in ropes off his bones, his skin was a greenish transparent white, and his fingers and stomach were bloated and had a deep brown hue.   

I looked at the dog tag lazily strewn on the body’s neck, it read: ‘Steele Edward – 00-BD31267-Catholic'. Well, we knew his name, so we could probably contact his family. It’ll be a mess to cover up though, we’ve had too many police here after the Bonfire Night incident.  

Andy was looking at the body like one of those photos of traumatized soldiers from the First World War. His eyes were fixed on the body, occasionally flickering over to me. Then, something else fell out. I was slammed against the wall; I didn’t even get a glance at whatever it was. It seemed lanky, very tall, at least 7 feet tall. Its touch was cold. I heard some yelling as I was dropped onto the ground, some crunching, fleshy sounds, like someone biting into a piece of lettuce. Then I went unconscious.  

I don’t really know where I am right now, it’s cold, the walls are a light grey concrete. There’s a big metal door as well, I heard some people outside. My head hurts.

i’ve been slowly initiating NC for the past few months now. the last time i had a proper conversation with her was probably the beginning of the year. my mom rarely ever reaches out to me anyways. however she did show up to my apartment unannounced about a week ago to give me a piece of mail and invade my business, which of course just made me resent her even more.

I DONT WANT TO SEE YOU!!! WHY WOULD I!!! it’s so so so insanely infuriating. please leave me alone.

i’m struggling right now though because my mother still has some of my christmas decor at her house, stuff that i’d like back in my possession since it’s sentimental to me and, well, mine. it’s so strange though because anytime i realize i forgot something while i was moving out it turns into a fight or her wanting to see me instead of simply bringing it to me. wtaf. 

any tips on how to get my stuff back and what should i say to her asking to meet me???? i’m thinking of just saying we can grab coffee one morning and then i’ll ask for my stuff, i can hopefully make a plan to go to her house and get it. and then after that go completely NC. i just want my christmas stuff man </3",2,1744066690.0,raisedbynarcissists,5,0.76,False

My only Spanish prior to moving was six months of using an app for 5-10 minutes each day. I took a month of classes for 4 hours every weekday after arriving. I then switched to night classes twice a week. I somehow managed day-to-day life, but felt like fluency was going to take forever, if not longer.

Then a DS video showed up in my YT recommendations one day. I watched it, understood it, and enjoyed it. Wait, how did that happen?!? So I delved deeper. I created a DS account, put my textbook and notebook in a drawer, stopped going to night classes, and started watching videos for at least an hour a day.

Because I live in Madrid, I want to speak Spanish, but I know I should wait since I’m at 350-ish hours of CI. (Prior attempts were as awkward as expected.) But I’m already feeling like a different person after only 6 weeks of DS videos and you know what? I’m gonna at least try and use some short phrases and see (um, hear, actually) what comes out...

So I’m in a shop I visit every few weeks, reply to “¿Qué tal?” with, “No me gustan sus nubes. ¿Por siete o ocho semanas? ¿Como Londres o Portland? Bleh. Eh... ¡Muy bien!” The guy working there laughs and replies, I say something else, he stops for a second and says, “¡Hablas español!” And then we wrap up our mini-conversation/transaction. (We had only ever spoken in English before.)

A day later, I stop at a little sandwich shop and ask for a tortilla bocadillo in Spanish. (¡Quiero carbs!) The nice lady at the counter asks if I also want a drink. “Hmm, sí, bueno. Momento...” I look over the menu and decide on a cafe con leche. Would I like my sandwich warmed up? “Sí, caliente por favor.” As she hands me my coffee, steam rises from the little oven as my bocadillo comes out. Me: “Ay, muy caliente.” She smiles, pauses, and tries to say something in English, but it didn’t come out quite right. (It looks much hotter than it is.) “Muchas gracias. ¡Buen día!” I think I surprised her by simply understanding her. All I know is she made my day by trying to speak in English after forcing myself to only interact in Spanish.

## Understanding Cuisinart Carafe Compatibility

Before you rush to buy the frist Cuisinart replacement carafe you see, it's vital to ensure compatibility with your specific Cuisinart coffee maker model. Cuisinart offers a range of coffee makers,and the carafe sizes and designs vary. Identifying your Cuisinart coffee DCC part number is the first step.Look for the model number – usually found on the bottom of the unit – and use it to cross-reference with the carafe's compatibility list.

A common question is ""What Cuisinart coffee maker DCC model # carafe do I need?"". The DCC series is popular, but even within that series, there are variations. Such as,the DCC-1200 series,a widely used model,requires a specific DCC-1200 replacement carafe. You’ll also find other DCC series like the DCC-3200 and DCC-2200 which require other part numbers. Using the wrong carafe can lead to leaks, improper brewing, and ultimately, a frustrating coffee-making experience.

## top 3 Cuisinart Coffee Pot Replacement Options (2025)

Here are three of the top Cuisinart coffee pot replacement options for 2025, catering to various needs and budgets:

**1. Genuine Cuisinart Carafe (OEM):**

*   **Description:** A genuine Cuisinart carafe is manufactured by Cuisinart and designed specifically for your coffee maker model. This ensures perfect fit, optimal brewing performance, and adherence to Cuisinart's quality standards. These are sold at places that sell Cuisinart parts such as the official Cuisinart store or Amazon.
*   **Pros:** Guaranteed compatibility, superior quality, peace of mind. Using a genuine Cuisinart carafe ensures the optimal performance of your coffee maker and prolongs its lifespan. The Cuisinart coffee maker glass carafe adheres to the manufacturer's specifications.
*   **Cons:** Generally the most expensive option. May be harder to find for older or discontinued models.
*   **Best For:** Homeowners and coffee lovers who prioritize quality and perfect compatibility, and are willing to pay a premium for it. Commercial users who need reliability and consistency. For example, a small cafe owner will want to ensure quality.
*   **Example:** The Cuisinart DCC-1200CRF, a popular 12-cup replacement carafe with lid designed to work with an array of Cuisinart coffee makers.

**2.High-Quality Compatible Carafe (Aftermarket):**

*   **Description:** These are cuisinart compatible carafe options made by third-party manufacturers. They are designed to meet or exceed the specifications of the original Cuisinart carafe.
*   **Pros:** More affordable than genuine Cuisinart carafes. Ofen readily available. Can sometimes offer additional features like improved handles or enhanced durability.*   **Cons:** Compatibility can vary; carefully check the product description for your specific Cuisinart coffee DCC part number. Quality can differ substantially between brands. Off brand Cuisinart carafe options need thorough evaluation.
*   **Best For:** Cost-conscious homeowners/coffee drinkers and property managers who need a reliable replacement at a reasonable price.Also good for AirBnB hosts that need replacements when accidents happen.
*   **Considerations:** Look for carafes made from high-quality borosilicate glass,known for its thermal shock resistance and durability.A well-designed handle and drip-free pouring spout are also essential. These can vary widely in cost and quality. A replacement glass carafe for coffee maker should still provide good heat retention.

**3. Cuisinart Thermal Carafe Replacement:**

*   **Description:** many Cuisinart coffee makers now feature thermal carafes,which help keep your coffee hotter for longer without the need for a warming plate.A Cuisinart Thermal Carafe Replacement can be a great choice if you want to avoid the ""burnt"" taste that can sometimes occur with warming plates.

Hi everyone 🌸

I’m a 23-year-old psychology student from Belgium, and I’ve been on quite a personal journey the past few years.

Although I enjoy my studies and care deeply about helping others, I’ve felt increasingly unhappy and overwhelmed by the pressure of modern life. Everything feels like it has to go faster, better, more perfect. To cope with that and reconnect with myself, I turned toward movement, calm, and nourishment. Sport, yoga, and healthy food have helped me so much – both physically and mentally.

That’s why I’ve decided to follow my heart.

My dream is to create a small, peaceful space that combines:

* A cozy **coffee bar** with healthy snacks and protein-based drinks
* A **yoga/pilates studio** for small group classes, with a calm and inclusive vibe
* Weekend **workshops** about mindfulness, movement, and self-care

I want it to be a safe and inspiring place where people can recharge. I know how it feels to be lost in the noise, and I believe we all deserve spaces that support our well-being.

Right now, I’m still a student and my income is very limited. I’ve found a small building I could turn into this dream space, and I’m saving everything I can. I’ve already planned yoga teacher training this summer and I'm preparing recipes, business ideas, and concept designs in the evenings and weekends.

✨ If you believe in supporting young women with a purpose, or if you feel connected to this dream, I’d be incredibly grateful for any contribution – no matter how small. You would help me take the first real steps toward making this healing space a reality.

Thank you for reading my story, and even more for caring 💛  
If you have ideas, feedback, or just want to say hi – feel free to comment!
