1nq57em,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1nq57em/ive_helped_build_a_portfolio_of_100m_in_saas/,I’ve helped build a portfolio of $100M+ in SaaS products for 13 years. This is how our clients are doing it:,"1/ To find a real problem to solve, look for people that are duct-taping solutions together and bitching about it daily. ""Nice-to-have"" features will earn you exactly $0.

* Look for workflows where people are using 3+ different tools to accomplish one task (like designers using Figma + Slack + Google Sheets + email for project approvals)
* Monitor industry-specific forums, subreddits, and Facebook groups where professionals complain about the same process repeatedly
* Pay attention to phrases like ""I wish there was a way to..."" or ""Why doesn't anyone make something that..."" - these are goldmines for product ideas

2/ Stop chasing ""revolutionary"" bullshit. The money is in fixing persistent headaches everyone just accepts as ""part of the job.""

* Focus on improving existing processes by 10x rather than creating entirely new categories. Example: MacPaw grew revenue 200% by simply moving CleanMyMac from a licensing model to SaaS subscriptions
* Look for industries where people say ""that's just how it's always been done"" - these are ripe for disruption with simple improvements
* Build better versions of tools people already pay for, rather than trying to convince them they need something completely new

3/ Once you have an idea, call 10 people who'd actually use this thing. Don't pitch them anything - just ask what makes them want to throw their laptop out the window. If they don't think your idea is that thing, keep digging.

* Start conversations with ""Walk me through your typical Tuesday"" instead of ""What do you think of this idea?"" - you'll get real workflow insights
* Ask follow-up questions like ""How much time does that waste?"" and ""What's the cost when that breaks?"" to quantify pain points
* Record these calls (with permission) and create a pain point frequency chart - the most mentioned problems are your best targets

4/ Write down everything your MVP won't do and stick it on your wall. Half your features are ego projects. Cut everything that doesn't get someone from frustrated/yearning to ""holy shit this works.""

* Create a ""Not Now"" list that's twice as long as your feature list - successful SaaS companies often cut 60-70% of planned features before launch
* If you can't explain the core value to your mom in 30 seconds, your MVP is too complex
* For each feature, ask ""If this was the ONLY thing our product did, would someone pay for it?"" - if the answer is no, cut it

5/ Ship when you're cringing. Ugly = good when you're early.

* Set a hard deadline of 90 days maximum for your first version - longer than that and you'll over-engineer everything
* Use tools like Bubble, Webflow, or even Google Sheets as your backend initially - perfect code doesn't matter if nobody uses it
* Launch with manual processes you can automate later - many successful SaaS companies started by manually fulfilling services before building automation

6/ You are customer service. No hiding behind chatbots or ""escalating to the team."" Every angry email lands in your inbox until you're big enough to hate yourself.

* Respond to support emails within 2 hours during business hours - early customers will become evangelists if you're responsive
* Keep a shared document of every customer complaint and the solution - this becomes your FAQ and feature roadmap
* Track response times and customer satisfaction, even if you're the only agent

7/ Make them pay something, even if it's $1. Free users will waste months of your life with feedback that goes nowhere.

* Offer a 7-day free trial instead of a freemium model - paying customers give better feedback because they're invested
* Use pricing tiers like $9/month, $29/month, $99/month - psychological pricing works and helps you understand value perception
* Track the ratio of free users to paid conversions - if it's below 2% after 30 days, your free tier is too generous

8/ Send cold messages that get ignored by almost everyone. The few who reply will save you from building something nobody wants.

* Send 50 LinkedIn messages per week with specific, personal details about their industry challenges - generic messages get 0% response rates
* Use subject lines like ""Quick question about \[specific workflow they posted about\]"" instead of pitches
* Follow up exactly once after 1 week with additional value (article, tool recommendation) - persistence without value is spam

9/ If nobody's touching a feature after 3 months, delete it. Your attachment to code you wrote doesn't pay bills.

* Set up analytics to track feature usage from day one
* Create a document listing what you removed and why - this prevents rebuilding the same mistakes

10/ Don't try to be the next Slack, Notion, Lovable, or any of the big guys. They have armies and ad budgets. You have coffee and credit card debt. Act accordingly.

* Target market segments too small for big companies but perfect for bootstrapping - think 10,000-50,000 potential customers max
* Compete on speed and personal service, not features - you can implement customer requests in days, they take months
* If you MUST be “the next xyz” - focus on one specific use case they ignore, like ""Slack for construction crews"" or ""Notion for restaurant managers""

11/ Create habits by solving daily pain. Users should feel a ""withdrawal"" from your product.

* Build around existing daily habits rather than trying to create new ones - integrate with tools people already use every day
* Use email notifications strategically - send daily summaries or reminders that provide value
* Track ""days since last login"" and reach out personally when someone hasn't used your product in 3 days

12/ Hire someone who can fix things when users say ""this sucks"", and who'll tell you when your grand vision sounds like nonsense.

* Your first hire should be technical if you're not, or business-focused if you are - complementary skills beat similar ones
* Look for people who've worked at companies similar in size to where you want to be in 2 years, not where you are now
* Use probationary contracts for 90 days with clear success metrics - cultural fit matters more than perfect resumes in early stages

13/ Write a lot of content and publish it where your audience spends the most time.

* Create ""problem-focused"" content like ""Why \[industry workflow\] is broken and how to fix it"" rather than product-focused content
* Repurpose one piece of content into 5+ formats - blog post becomes Twitter thread, LinkedIn article, YouTube video, and email newsletter
* Track which content drives trial signups, not just views - vanity metrics don't pay bills

14/ Start controlling your finances early. You have to know where your money comes from and goes to.

* Track MRR, churn, and LTV from your first paying customer
* Set up separate business accounts for different purposes - operating expenses, tax savings, and emergency fund
* Calculate your ""runway"" monthly - how many months you can survive at current burn rate, and track this religiously

15/ A good accountant and an HR contractor (if you get to build a team) will save you MANY headaches. Don't skimp on them.

* Find an accountant who specializes in SaaS businesses and subscription revenue recognition - regular accountants often mess up recurring revenue
* Monitor HR compliance once you hit 3+ employees - employment law violations can kill early-stage companies
* Budget 3-5% of revenue for professional services from day one - it's insurance against expensive mistakes later",1,1758802725.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

1nq5550,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1nq5550/why_does_the_uk_make_starting_small_businesses/,Why does the UK make starting small businesses way harder than it needs to be?,"I’ve just come back from holiday in Asia and one of the things that really hit me was how people could just pull up on the street and sell food, clothes, drinks. basically anything. A wok, a grill, a basket of fruit, whatever. No massive setup, no branding, just normal people hustling a living. It worked, it fed people, it gave the consumer options and it gave them a way to start small without needing a fortune behind them.

Then you get back to the UK and realise how impossible that is here. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against regulation. We need strict rules for construction, finance, healthcare, big-scale stuff where public safety is on the line. But why do we regulate everything else to the point where the average person can’t even try?

If I wanted to sell burgers from a home made trolley/stall tomorrow, I’d need licences, hygiene certificates, liability insurance, waste disposal agreements, council approval for a pitch (that I’d also have to rent), and probably another pile of paperwork. By the time I’ve done all that, I’ve already spent nearly a couple grand before I’ve even sold a £3.50 burger.

And it’s not like this kills off the big players anyway. Where I was on holiday, they still had massive malls, chain restaurants, multinationals, and they were still full of customers. Street stalls weren’t replacing them, they were just giving people more options. Cheap eats, quick bites, or a small business owner selling clothes for a few quid alongside the high-end shops. Everyone coexisted fine.

Meanwhile, here the system basically blocks it from the start unless you have the capital for the upfront investment. 

Want to run a mobile car wash? Drowned in water regs and permits.

Want a mobile coffee van? You need Vehicle inspections, street trading licence, food hygiene registration, liability insurance, parking/trading restrictions, PAT testing for equipment, waste disposal contracts.

Event catering? Multiple food hygiene checks, portable equipment safety, gas safety certification, liability insurance, transport permits, temporary event notices, alcohol licensing if drinks are involved 

Street clothing stalls? Street trading licence, liability insurance, designated pitches only (with high fees), restrictions on times and locations, waste disposal compliance.

In my opinion, the multinationals love this. They can afford compliance teams, lawyers, and expensive pitches. Councils love it too, because they get their fees. The people who lose are the ones who just want to try something small.

Why should a multi-billion pound McDonald’s care if I’m selling burgers on the street for £3.50? But they do. Because the myth of capitalism is “competition is great.” The reality is capitalism means you need serious financial backing just to even play the game.

Sometimes we just need common sense regulation. Protect people from actual danger, yes. But don’t make it so over-the-top that normal people can’t even try. Options are what make a place thrive, and we’ve killed that spirit here

1nq4zp4,https://easethegrind.wordpress.com/2025/08/15/steam-mops-the-best-of-the-best/,Steam Mops: Because Your Floor Deserves a Spa Day Too,"Let’s be honest—mopping sucks. It’s basically pushing dirty water around until you convince yourself the floor looks “good enough.” But a steam mop? That’s the glow-up of cleaning tools. Instead of smearing grime around, it shoots scalding vapor straight into the battlefield, killing germs, loosening gunk, and making your tile floor squeakier than a middle-school clarinet. Plus, you look like a wizard wielding a wand made for linoleum.

Why you should get one:

	1.	Sanitizing power – Steam mops cook germs alive with the power of science. No harsh chemicals, no mystery sprays, just water turned into rage-mist.
	2.	Easy cleaning – Fill, plug, mop. No buckets, no wringing, no accidentally dumping a gallon of dirty water on your socks.
       3.	Oddly satisfying – Watching sticky messes dissolve in seconds is basically ASMR for adults.
	4.	Multipurpose magic – Some models even work on carpets, rugs, and upholstery. Yes, you’ll steam your couch just because you can.

The Best Steam Mops (a.k.a. the Floor Avengers):

	•	Bissell PowerFresh Steam Mop – The crowd favorite. Lightweight, fast heat-up, and powerful enough to obliterate sticky kitchen crimes. Bonus: it smells nice if you use the fragrance discs, which feels very bougie for a mop.
Amazon link: https://amzn.to/3KrKNYp

	•	Shark Genius Steam Pocket Mop – Sleek, clever, and comes with a hands-free pad release so you never have to touch your gross mop pad again. Basically the Tesla of steam mops, minus the autopilot.
Amazon link: https://amzn.to/4nlo8f1

	•	Dupray Neat (with mop attachments) – Technically a steam cleaner, but when you attach the mop head, this cube becomes a floor-sanitizing monster. Minimalist, powerful, and way cooler looking than your old bucket.
Amazon link: https://amzn.to/4nnxiYs

       •Shark Steam & Scrub All‑in‑One S7000: Rotating pads + steam = more aggressive grime removal. If you’ve ever felt like your floor had layers of shame, this one helps peel them back.
Amazon link: https://amzn.to/4nIxHV2

	•	Bissell Symphony Steam Mop + Vacuum – Yes, it vacuums and steams at the same time. It’s the multitasking overachiever of floor care. Perfect for when you want to feel like a cleaning cyborg.
Amazon link: https://amzn.to/3KhCSgp

	•	Shark Lift-Away Pro Steam Pocket Mop – A mop that goes from cleaning floors to handheld steaming mode for counters and grout. It’s like a Swiss Army knife with a steamy attitude.
Amazon link: https://amzn.to/4nMfndw

        •.   Aspiron Steam Cleaner is basically a boiling water bazooka for your house, blasting out 293°F steam at up to 4 bars of pressure to melt grease, grime, and whatever sticky crime your kitchen floor has been hiding since last Thanksgiving. With a big tank that runs close to 50 minutes and a toolbox worth of attachments, you can attack grout, upholstery, car seats, and even that weird corner behind the toilet with the enthusiasm of a cleaning-obsessed Ghostbuster. Sure, it takes about five minutes to heat up and the canister setup can feel a bit bulky (and yes, you’ll probably lose at least one of the 21 little accessories in the first week), but once you’re hissing steam like a caffeinated dragon, you’ll forgive it. If you hate chemicals and want to feel like a wizard armed with angry mist, the Aspiron makes dirt disappear and gives you bragging rights over your suddenly spotless grout.
Amazon link: https://amzn.to/429kLzf

     •.  Bissell SpinWave SmartSteam Spin Mop: Quiet, rotating pads, smart-features. Gives you that spin without needing a spin class. Good if you want more scrubbing but less effort.

Amazon link: https://amzn.to/3KrMTrf

Final Thoughts:
If you hate mopping but love clean floors (so… everyone?), a steam mop is your new best friend. It’s faster, cleaner, and way more satisfying than sloshing around dirty water. Plus, you’ll finally be able to say, “Yeah, my floors are actually sanitized,” while casually sipping coffee like the domestic god(ess) you are.

1nq4ywy,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nq4ywy/ignorance_is_bliss/,Ignorance is bliss,"TW: blood, implied sexual content

I was staying in an old hostel where I had been let a room for a few days. I had gone out and had just returned to find two girls supervising a group of workers moving in an extra bed and other things into the room. I protested at someone having entered the room without my permission.

The smaller of the two girls lost her temper and began to yell at me, screeching in an annoying high pitched voice saying she was burdened with having to manage people wanting rooms and having run out of them or something of the sort. I was not too happy at having my privacy invaded so I shot back at her with no intention of letting her get away with this behaviour. I told her that I had left my valuables in the room and that she could personally look forward to a legal quagmire if I were to find anything amiss. The other girl who appeared to have kept her composure intervened, soothing her and told her “anyone would be bothered, especially if they had left something expensive behind believing it to be secure”. She followed this with an apology to me.

The smaller girl finally shut up and I decided it would be wiser to address the calmer of the two. I apologised at having had to raise my voice and thanked her for understanding my point of view. The smaller one apologised as well and told me that she had been disturbed at what had been going on in the hostel of late which I would not be familiar with as I was new there. Both of them looked quite tired, the smaller one had clearly slept poorly as evidenced by the dark marks under her eyes and her friend looked quite pale and rather ill. I asked her as to what had happened and she related that there had been some sort of incident in one of the bathrooms last night. She told me that the bathroom had become a den of the most disgusting degeneracy and people did not want to occupy rooms on the same floor and hence the extra bed in my room.

Her rather melodramatic description piqued my curiosity. The two of them led me to the bathroom at my request. The place was absolutely disgusting, I was revolted. The smell was utterly foul and the floor was flooded with a layer of dirty water. In one of the stalls where the door was open, I could see a large dark stain on the floor that looked like it might be dried up blood. It was a rather wide patch and it had the appearance of coffee grounds. It looked like someone had been very sick or very injured. “What happened here!” I exclaimed. One of the girls said that it looked like menstrual blood. I was aghast, there was far too much blood for this to have been a trivial accident. Realising what I must be thinking, the smaller one said that someone had coupled up in the bathroom last night —the people in the neighbouring rooms had overhead; and whatever they had indulged in had left this ugly stain. For a moment I wondered what sort of ‘coupling’ could have possible led to this most vile parody of a Rorschach test on the bathroom floor but decided I was better off not knowing.

I closed my eyes against this perverse sight. I had a hangover and it was making me dizzy. Hazy memories played beneath my dark eyelids. I felt sorry for the mess the two girls were left to deal with. I opened my eyes and looked at the smaller girl and then at the other. The pallor of her skin was striking. She caught my gaze and gave me a shy smile. Shame I never realised she was sick last night.",1,1758802036.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Most of the gurus out there are juts simply lying to you. No need to build complex ai automation systems. nobody wants those. real companies will never pay for it, especially if the have to fire their receptionist and replace him with an ai voice agent. hah... not gonna happen.

So I will try not to be mean on this rant post but kind of direct and honest with what I've learnt throughout my ai journey dealing with clients and real paid work.

Long story short...I have sold the exact same workflow for $500 to one client and $5,000 to another. Same tools. Same steps. Same outcome. The difference was not the system. The difference was the value I tied it to and how I packaged it.

Now it sucked at frist. I was like why? $500 and now for the same one $5,000? It seemed to me that I was mocking the client... but I did not. I couldn't grasp my mind around that for a while after it happened.

So I realized a few things and decided to drop em here on a kind of quick post let's say. (it will be long hah).

If you build automation for real businesses, here is how you charge more for the same work without turning into a clown and actually believing in your systems.

**1) Solve hot problems near revenue**  
Most clients show up with 10 problems. Pick the ones that touch money.

Quick example from a marketing agency that charges 10k a month:

* **Problem A: Expense reporting.** Admins submit receipts by email. Accounting spends about 20 hours a month cleaning it up at 60 per hour. Cost of the problem is about 1,000 a month.
* **Problem B: Speed to lead.** They get 60 inbound leads a month. They reply in 3 hours, not 5 minutes. About 5 leads slip away monthly. They close 20 percent at 10k a month and average 3 months per client. Lost revenue is about 30,000 a month.

Both solutions take you 3 to 4 hours to build in Make or Zapier. Webhook in, transform data, drop to a sheet or CRM, trigger the next step. Identical effort. One fixes a 1k leak. One fixes a 30k leak. Which one are you going to pitch first? Don't hurry...think about it for a sec.

**Rule:** Aim your builds at lead gen, sales, onboarding. Those sit closest to revenue. Dashboards and expense bots can wait.

**2) Increase perceived value without changing the core build**  
Coffee at home costs cents. Coffee at a great cafe costs 6. The beans are not 20 times better. The experience is.

Do the same with your service. Stop selling a lonely workflow. Sell an experience around it.

**Bad offer:** “I will build a speed to lead flow.”  
**Good offer:** “Revenue acceleration package.” Includes the speed to lead flow, Make environment setup, weekly strategy call until launch, Slack access, Loom docs, short playbook, one click CRM integration, small library of related automations, and a 90 day optimization plan.

Reality check on effort: if the build is 10 hours, the extras add maybe 4 to 5 hours total. But your scope now lists 10 helpful line items instead of one. Clients perceive an agency relationship, not a script. You can charge 3 to 4 times more for about 1.5 times the work.

**How to add the extras fast:**

* Record a 20 minute Loom walking through the system, module by module. Run it through AI to generate the SOP.
* Grab 5 to 7 simple related templates from your library and include them. Most clients will hire you to implement them anyway.
* Strategy calls are 30 minutes with a short agenda. Half the value is clarity and buy in.
* Slack access feels premium. In practice you will get a few messages a week.

**3) Price higher. Yes, literally just raise it.**  
Double your price and you will not lose half your deals. Budgets are not linear. Even if you did lose half, you still make the same money with fewer clients, which cuts your fixed costs.

* Every client creates fixed overhead: onboarding, kickoff, project setup, baseline comms.
* Fewer clients at a higher price means fewer times you pay that fixed overhead.
* Higher paying clients are less nitpicky, trust your process more, and have bigger upsell room.

When I moved a 1,500 offer to 4,000 without changing the build, my client base leveled up overnight. Less hand holding. Faster decisions. Bigger follow on projects.

**What to sell at each stage that commands a premium**  
Keep it simple. Keep it close to money.

* **Inbound:** Form submit triggers instant reply, asks 3 qualifiers, routes by deal size, opens calendar, follows up at 15 minutes if no booking.
* **Outbound:** Daily lead scrape, enrich 3 to 5 fields, generate short openers, send in batches, track replies.
* **Sales:** Move deal to Proposal creates doc, sends it, tracks opens, nudges at 24 hours, escalates to call if opened twice, collects payment, fires onboarding.
* **Onboarding:** Payment triggers welcome email, access checklist, kickoff slot picker, internal tasks.
* **Fulfillment:** First deliverable draft with AI where it fits, assign reviewer, deliver, one click feedback.
* **Reactivation:** 60 to 90 day nudge with a real reason to re engage.

Each one is a handful of steps. No monster flows. No heroics. Just reliable outcomes.

So let's wrap this up cause I also need to go to bed somehow... 😴

**Simple rules that keep your pricing high and your builds sane**

* If it does not move revenue or protect profit, it is not a priority.
* If you cannot explain it in one sentence, it is not ready.
* If a junior cannot maintain it, it is a bad build.
* If one broken dependency kills the chain, redesign it.
* If the client needs to hire people to run it, you missed the point.

Hope it helped a bit.

See you soon.

Everyone talks about meditation, journaling, routines — but honestly, I feel like crap. I don’t have discipline or answers. I just… want to breathe easier. Maybe that’s my first step. Maybe yours too.

  
**Introduction (Type A)**

Healing always sounds like a big word — meditation, routines, healthy habits. But what if you feel stuck at zero? What if you don’t even know where to begin? That’s where I am right now. And maybe you are too.

 

**1. Healing doesn’t have to be perfect**

I used to think healing meant big lifestyle changes, but right now, I don’t even have the energy for that. And that’s okay. Healing can start with something as small as admitting, “I want to feel better.”

 

**2. My first tiny step**

For me, it’s just breathing. I don’t journal yet, I don’t meditate daily. I just try to pause, close my eyes, and take one deep breath. That’s my “healing practice” for now.

 

**3. Why I’m sharing this**

Because maybe you’re also at zero. Maybe you also feel like you’re failing at wellness before even starting. I want to remind you — beginning from nothing still counts.

 

**Conclusion**

I don’t have answers. But I’m willing to try. If you’re also at zero, maybe we can take one step at a time together.



**Learning to Heal Without Rules (TYPE B)**

 

There was a time I thought healing meant journaling at 6 AM, drinking green smoothies, and meditating for an hour. Truth? I couldn’t even get out of bed some days.

 

I felt like crap. No motivation, no routine, no “positive mindset.” Just a quiet wish: “I don’t want to feel this way forever.”

 

That was my first step. Not journaling, not yoga — just admitting I wanted to feel better.

 

What I tried (and maybe you can too):

 

One deep breath before checking my phone.

 

Drinking a glass of water before coffee.

 

Writing one line in my notes app, not a whole journal.

 

 

Tiny steps. That’s all. And slowly, I realized — healing doesn’t have to start with discipline. It can start with softness.

 

So if you’re at zero, here’s a reminder: you don’t have to climb the mountain today. Just stand up and look at it. That’s already healing.

Earth, April 12, 2116

On the giant screens that had recently displayed parades of battleships and the stern face of Admiral Thorne, an image of innocence now reigned. In offices where holographic displays once tracked ammunition production rates, breaths were now held. In homes where for two decades families had gathered in the shadow of fear, dreading news from the industrial front and the fulfillment of production plans, they now gathered in genuine wonder. The broadcast was singular: one thousand newborn, tiny members of the L'thaarr race, sleeping peacefully in technologically advanced, sterile cradles.

Their appearance, reminiscent of the sweetest terrestrial sloths with disproportionately large, trusting, black eyes, moved the hearts of billions. Every nearly soundless sigh, every lazy movement of a three-fingered paw, transmitted in the highest resolution, went viral. For a population starved of positive news, weary from years of sacrifice and mourning, the sight of them became more than news—it became a cultural phenomenon, a collective catharsis.

Every television program, every radio station, and even the reactivated, niche paper newspapers wrote about them at length. ""The Little Sloths Are Alive!"", ""The Race Has a Future!"", ""The Fruit of Our Sacrifice!""—these were just a few of the headlines that replaced the old calls to save energy and turn in scrap metal. Freed from its wartime shackles, the economy reacted with predatory swiftness. Stores were flooded with a wave of plush toys that children cuddled to sleep, clothing, games, and breakfast cereals bearing the image of the small L'thaarr. They had unintentionally become the living, breathing symbol of the meaning behind the last twenty years of sacrifice. The bloody effort of the Guard, the sweat and tears of factory workers—all of it suddenly had the face of a sleeping, defenseless child.

In his minimalist, official office, Rear Admiral Volkov watched the news with an ironic smile. Alistair Finch, the same pompous propagandist, was now speaking with almost genuine emotion in his voice about the ""miracle of birth"" and the ""joint triumph of humanity and science."" It was a hundred times more effective than all his old tirades about ""genetic destiny"" and the ""sacred scars"" on the hulls of starships. Volkov thought of McKenzie's one hundred and twenty-two victims, of the price that had been paid for this ""miracle."" But seeing the authentic joy on the faces of people in the streets, he understood that no one was capable of accepting the whole truth. They needed a simplified, beautiful version of it. The L'thaarr children had become a safety valve that reunited a tired, divided society. The goal that had been all but forgotten—the salvation of the Seven Worlds—returned with a force that not even Thorne's best propaganda specialists could have fabricated. This was no longer an empty doctrine proclaimed from a podium. It was tangible proof, sleeping in cradles, that their sacrifice had mattered.

Lena Kowalska's leave in Berlin was like immersing herself in another dimension. She visited the cemetery, laid flowers on the grave of her former love, and, without tears, bid farewell to a past that seemed to belong to someone else. A few days later, simply seeking a moment's escape from military discipline, she found herself in a small, smoky lesbian bar in the Kreuzberg district. There she met Karina—an artist, a sculptress with hands smudged with clay and paint, capable of creating wonders from both dead material and from her body. Karina was the embodiment of a freedom Lena had never known. She wasn't in the Guard, her life wasn't subordinated to orders and regulations, so Lena knew from the start this would only be a holiday affair. But what an affair it was.

Now, in Karina's apartment, which smelled of turpentine, coffee, and freedom, Lena was a work of art. Her wrists were tied with soft silk scarves to the carved oak bedframe. Karina loved to dominate, and Lena, to her own great surprise, loved to let her. To be helpless, to surrender control—it was a feeling more intoxicating than the strongest alcohol.

She arched her back as her lover's mouth found its target. Karina's tongue was like a master's brush—precise, flawless, painting a map of pleasure on her body. It circled lightly around her swollen clitoris, only to then, with an equally deft caress, brush against her anus. Karina liked to lick ass; it gave her a wild pleasure, and for Lena, the feeling was deliciously humiliating and arousing at the same time. The sculptress's hands caressed her nipples, kneading and stretching them, without for a second interrupting the rhythmic, hypnotic stimulation of her tongue.

The minutes blended into one long, hot wave of pure pleasure. She felt her mind, usually sharp as a razor and focused on tactics, dissolve into pure sensation.

""I don't think I'm going to come today, darling..."" she whispered, feeling she was on the verge of something unknown, powerful, almost terrifying.

""Shhh... Close your eyes and let me work,"" Karina murmured, not lifting her mouth from her body, as if tasting the most precious wine.

It lasted for fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes of uninterrupted, masterful, maddening cunnilingus. Suddenly, Lena felt something strange—a contraction so deep and powerful, the likes of which she had never experienced, as if her body was about to explode from within. For the first time in her life, she experienced a female ejaculation. A warm, salty stream of fluid gushed onto Karina's face, who greedily, with a murmur of satisfaction, drank her juices, saying at the same time:

""Don't run away... I'll drink it all. This is all for me.""

""I finally did it,"" she laughed softly, triumphant, rising from above Lena's trembling, sweaty body. She gracefully untied her hands. ""And now, my dear Lena, you will repay me. I'm going to sit on your face.""

On the other side of the globe, in a small, neat apartment with a view of a rebuilding, bustling park, Kael and Anna were watching an old movie. They had been living together for several months. After a first, awkward date at the cinema to see ""Interview with the Vampire,"" they discovered that old, twentieth-century cinema was their shared passion—an escape to worlds that had passed, just like the world of their own youth. Their relationship was not tempestuous and passionate like Lena's. It was quiet, calm, built on a foundation of mutual understanding, on scars that didn't need to be shown because they could be felt in the silence between them.

""Blade Runner"" from 1982 was playing on the screen, in a digitally restored version. Kael was absolutely fascinated by the character of Roy Batty—a being created for combat, a synthetic soldier with a programmed expiration date, who desired only ""more life."" He saw himself in him.

As the final scene on the rooftop unfolded on screen, in the downpour of acid rain, and the replicant delivered his famous monologue about ships on fire and C-beams glittering in the dark, Kael felt a familiar stab of icy cold in his heart. The memories from Proxima, images he had never described to anyone, returned with full force. He saw the cracking hulls of destroyers in the first battle for the orbit. He saw plasma tearing through his men's armor. All those moments that were supposed to be lost. Anna, without taking her eyes off the screen, simply took his hand and squeezed it tightly. She didn't have to ask. She understood.

As Batty died in the rain and the end credits appeared, Kael turned to Anna. The feverish emptiness he had carried within him since his return was gone from his eyes. There was boundless tenderness. He leaned in and began to kiss her—slowly, gently, as if he wanted to memorize the taste of every moment, to anchor himself in the present. His hands slid under her shirt, and she responded in kind, pulling him closer.

In the cool, blue light emanating from the screen, to the sound of Vangelis's melancholy, synthetic music, they began to make love. It was not an explosion of wild desire, but a slow, conscious act of affirmation. An affirmation that they were still alive, that they could feel, and that amidst all the memories that would one day be ""lost in time, like tears in rain,"" they had found each other. They were two relics in a new world, two veterans too old in spirit for their young looks. But at least, in that one, quiet moment, they were no longer alone.

In the sterile silence of the Guard complex, in the laboratory, an act of creation was now to take place. In the center of the room stood the recovered Plague body printer—a device of organic, unsettling shapes, now tamed by human technology and the help of the L'thaarr. Beside it, on pedestals, waited fifteen empty, printed L'thaarr bodies. They were primordial forms, recreated with genetic precision thanks to the work of Professor McKenzie. They looked different from the L'thaarr the humans knew—slimmer, with greater grace, devoid of the genetic scars and modifications that the Plague had burned into them over six hundred years of slavery.

Behind armored glass stood the witnesses. Aris Thorne, with the face of a scientist beholding a miracle. Professor McKenzie, whose stone mask of indifference for the first time bore traces of something akin to redemption. Faaht and several other surviving L'thaarr, watching with a mixture of horror and devout reverence. And Admiral Marcus Thorne.

When McKenzie gave the signal, the procedure began. The golden flash drive, a sacred relic containing the last consciousness copies that remembered the time before their enslavement, was connected to the interface. The transfer began. Marcus did not see a miracle in this. He saw a data transfer. But when the first of the printed bodies twitched and opened its eyes—eyes that had last seen freedom on their homeworld six centuries ago—even he felt the weight of the moment.

Later, as the fifteen oldest consciousnesses, the minds of the L'thaarr race, were acclimating to their new-old physicality, the golden flash drive was taken to the Guard's Main Archive. It was placed in a titanium vault, and on the digital lock, an annotation appeared, personally edited by the admiral: ""To be opened only on the personal order of Grand Admiral Marcus Thorne or Chief Scientist Aris Thorne."" For Aris, this was the protection of a priceless cultural heritage. For Marcus, it was the locking away of the most powerful intelligence data in history.

Their knowledge of their culture, history, and—most importantly—their place of origin was invaluable to the L'thaarr council. Unfortunately, it confirmed the analysts' worst fears. Their homeworld was 270 light-years from Earth.

Marcus stood before a holographic map of the galaxy, and the newly plotted point shone like a distant, unattainable star. 270 light-years. The number echoed in his mind.

""There's no chance of retaking it,"" he said quietly to his brother, who stood beside him. ""The distance is too great. At 0.5c, that's over five hundred years of travel. One way.""

It was then, looking at the immensity of the void separating Earth from its goal, that Marcus fully grasped the nature of the enemy. The Plague Empire was not a collection of planets and systems. It was a network, an empire with a clear structure and its center on their homeworld. And the binder of this network, its blood and nervous system, was their technology of consciousness transfer and body printing.

A terrible technology, Marcus thought, feeling a cold shiver that could not be rationally explained. Individuals would die on one planet, their armor torn apart by a 'Thor's' cannons, and in that same instant, their last backup, their soul, was sent quantumly 400 light-years away. There, at another facility, in another base, a 3D printer birthed them anew. They were immortal in the most practical, terrifying way. Their empire had no borders, because distance did not exist for them.

His mind, accustomed to strategic thinking, followed this to even darker conclusions.

Besides... if one of their generals is a good leader, it's possible his consciousness copies are fighting on two different fronts simultaneously. He could be in two places at once, in two different bodies. Commanding a fleet in one system while simultaneously overseeing the construction of a beachhead in another. The thought made his head ache. How do you fight an enemy who can sacrifice an entire army without losing a single commander? How do you defeat someone who is everywhere?

Then, the most disturbing, philosophical thought struck him.

How would I behave if I met myself? A copy of me that was out of date, say, by a few months? A copy that wouldn't know about my decisions today, about the stormy conversation with Volkov, about the plan to loosen the reins. Would that still be me? Or another person, wearing my face and memories? Would I treat him like a brother? Or like a rival who must be eliminated to preserve the unity of command and identity?

The concept of ""I,"" for Marcus the foundation of his existence, of his willpower, was fluid, disposable, replicable for the Plague. That is what made them monsters. It was blasphemy against the very nature of consciousness.

He looked again at the distant point marking the L'thaarr world. A five-hundred-year journey. The mission to Habitat 1, which was supposed to last for decades, now seemed like merely a first, childish step in a war whose true scale no one yet comprehended.

A heavy silence hung in the office, broken only by the soft hum of the holographic projector. Marcus Thorne turned away from the galactic map, his face, usually a mask of strategic calm, now marked by a deep, almost fanatical anxiety. He looked at his brother, and in his eyes burned the fire of a newly understood threat.

""Brother,"" his voice was hard, devoid of any emotion other than ice-cold determination. ""We have to destroy their nervous system. We must disrupt their consciousness transfer or somehow introduce a computer virus into their servers storing the backups! It's the only way.""

Aris, who until now had been silently contemplating the miracle of the L'thaarr's rebirth, looked at him in horror.

""Marcus, do you even understand what you're asking? These aren't just databases. From what the L'thaarr have told us, we know that besides the Plague's consciousness copies, there are tens, if not hundreds of billions of innocent copies of conquered races. Entire civilizations digitized and thrown into one monstrous archive. By destroying those servers, we would commit digital genocide on a scale the universe has never seen. We might destroy dozens of races that have survived only in this form!""

Marcus slammed his fist on the control console. The map flickered.

""And what choice do we have?! You heard the L'thaarr! They won't stop! We are fighting a war of attrition that we cannot win! Every one of our soldiers who dies on Proxima b or some other cosmic backwater, every crew of a 'Thor' that is turned to dust, dies for real! Their death is final. And theirs? Their death is just a temporary inconvenience! A minor logistical problem! They're just waiting in a quantum waiting room for a new body printer!""

He walked up to Aris, his gaze so intense it was almost a physical pressure.

""We have to do it, somehow. We have to cut this umbilical cord that makes them immortal. Every loss of ours is permanent, theirs is only temporary. This asymmetry will kill us if we do nothing about it. Figure something out!""

""'Figure something out'?"" Aris shook his head in disbelief. ""Marcus, the L'thaarr were lucky. Their oldest copies survived on a local sub-server that we captured. But what about the rest? Their consciousnesses are still on the Plague's main server, frozen in time. If we destroyed it, we would kill their past. We would kill their true ancestors. We became Death, the destroyer of worlds, when we extinguished Proxima b. Are we now to become the destroyers of souls?""

""Yes! If it's necessary!"" Marcus shouted, his voice echoing in the sterile room. ""You don't understand, Aris! They can have one brilliant strategist in ten bodies, on ten fronts! We have one Volkov. One Kent. One Kael. One Lyra. When we lose them, we lose them forever. This is a war where they are playing chess, and we are sacrificing living people!""

He grabbed his brother by the shoulders, his voice lowering to an intense, menacing whisper.

""I'm not asking you to push a button and commit a massacre. I'm asking you to find a way. A virus that only attacks the signatures of Plague consciousness copies? A way to separate their data? Maybe some method to corrupt the transfer process itself, not the archive? I don't know! That's why you are the Chief Scientist of the Guard! I make the decisions that get hands dirty with blood. You are supposed to find the solutions that give us a chance for that blood not to be shed in vain. So figure something out, damn it! Before we all die, or worse, after we lose, our consciousness copies become a resource for the Plague!! And we become slaves!!""

""The Little Sloths Are Alive!"", ""The Race Has a Future!"", ""The Fruit of Our Sacrifice!""—these were just a few of the headlines that replaced the old calls to save energy and turn in scrap metal. Freed from its wartime shackles, the economy reacted with predatory swiftness. Stores were flooded with a wave of plush toys that children cuddled to sleep, clothing, games, and breakfast cereals bearing the image of the small L'thaarr. They had unintentionally become the living, breathing symbol of the meaning behind the last twenty years of sacrifice. The bloody effort of the Guard, the sweat and tears of factory workers—all of it suddenly had the face of a sleeping, defenseless child.

In his minimalist, official office, Rear Admiral Volkov watched the news with an ironic smile. Alistair Finch, the same pompous propagandist, was now speaking with almost genuine emotion in his voice about the ""miracle of birth"" and the ""joint triumph of humanity and science."" It was a hundred times more effective than all his old tirades about ""genetic destiny"" and the ""sacred scars"" on the hulls of starships. Volkov thought of McKenzie's one hundred and twenty-two victims, of the price that had been paid for this ""miracle."" But seeing the authentic joy on the faces of people in the streets, he understood that no one was capable of accepting the whole truth. They needed a simplified, beautiful version of it. The L'thaarr children had become a safety valve that reunited a tired, divided society. The goal that had been all but forgotten—the salvation of the Seven Worlds—returned with a force that not even Thorne's best propaganda specialists could have fabricated. This was no longer an empty doctrine proclaimed from a podium. It was tangible proof, sleeping in cradles, that their sacrifice had mattered.

Lena Kowalska's leave in Berlin was like immersing herself in another dimension. She visited the cemetery, laid flowers on the grave of her former love, and, without tears, bid farewell to a past that seemed to belong to someone else. A few days later, simply seeking a moment's escape from military discipline, she found herself in a small, smoky lesbian bar in the Kreuzberg district. There she met Karina—an artist, a sculptress with hands smudged with clay and paint, capable of creating wonders from both dead material and from her body. Karina was the embodiment of a freedom Lena had never known. She wasn't in the Guard, her life wasn't subordinated to orders and regulations, so Lena knew from the start this would only be a holiday affair. But what an affair it was.

Now, in Karina's apartment, which smelled of turpentine, coffee, and freedom, Lena was a work of art. Her wrists were tied with soft silk scarves to the carved oak bedframe. Karina loved to dominate, and Lena, to her own great surprise, loved to let her. To be helpless, to surrender control—it was a feeling more intoxicating than the strongest alcohol.

She arched her back as her lover's mouth found its target. Karina's tongue was like a master's brush—precise, flawless, painting a map of pleasure on her body. It circled lightly around her swollen clitoris, only to then, with an equally deft caress, brush against her anus. Karina liked to lick ass; it gave her a wild pleasure, and for Lena, the feeling was deliciously humiliating and arousing at the same time. The sculptress's hands caressed her nipples, kneading and stretching them, without for a second interrupting the rhythmic, hypnotic stimulation of her tongue.

The minutes blended into one long, hot wave of pure pleasure. She felt her mind, usually sharp as a razor and focused on tactics, dissolve into pure sensation.

""I don't think I'm going to come today, darling..."" she whispered, feeling she was on the verge of something unknown, powerful, almost terrifying.

""Shhh... Close your eyes and let me work,"" Karina murmured, not lifting her mouth from her body, as if tasting the most precious wine.

It lasted for fifteen minutes. Fifteen minutes of uninterrupted, masterful, maddening cunnilingus. Suddenly, Lena felt something strange—a contraction so deep and powerful, the likes of which she had never experienced, as if her body was about to explode from within. For the first time in her life, she experienced a female ejaculation. A warm, salty stream of fluid gushed onto Karina's face, who greedily, with a murmur of satisfaction, drank her juices, saying at the same time:

""Don't run away... I'll drink it all. This is all for me.""

""I finally did it,"" she laughed softly, triumphant, rising from above Lena's trembling, sweaty body. She gracefully untied her hands. ""And now, my dear Lena, you will repay me. I'm going to sit on your face.""

On the other side of the globe, in a small, neat apartment with a view of a rebuilding, bustling park, Kael and Anna were watching an old movie. They had been living together for several months. After a first, awkward date at the cinema to see ""Interview with the Vampire,"" they discovered that old, twentieth-century cinema was their shared passion—an escape to worlds that had passed, just like the world of their own youth. Their relationship was not tempestuous and passionate like Lena's. It was quiet, calm, built on a foundation of mutual understanding, on scars that didn't need to be shown because they could be felt in the silence between them.

""Blade Runner"" from 1982 was playing on the screen, in a digitally restored version. Kael was absolutely fascinated by the character of Roy Batty—a being created for combat, a synthetic soldier with a programmed expiration date, who desired only ""more life."" He saw himself in him.

As the final scene on the rooftop unfolded on screen, in the downpour of acid rain, and the replicant delivered his famous monologue about ships on fire and C-beams glittering in the dark, Kael felt a familiar stab of icy cold in his heart. The memories from Proxima, images he had never described to anyone, returned with full force. He saw the cracking hulls of destroyers in the first battle for the orbit. He saw plasma tearing through his men's armor. All those moments that were supposed to be lost. Anna, without taking her eyes off the screen, simply took his hand and squeezed it tightly. She didn't have to ask. She understood.

As Batty died in the rain and the end credits appeared, Kael turned to Anna. The feverish emptiness he had carried within him since his return was gone from his eyes. There was boundless tenderness. He leaned in and began to kiss her—slowly, gently, as if he wanted to memorize the taste of every moment, to anchor himself in the present. His hands slid under her shirt, and she responded in kind, pulling him closer.

In the cool, blue light emanating from the screen, to the sound of Vangelis's melancholy, synthetic music, they began to make love. It was not an explosion of wild desire, but a slow, conscious act of affirmation. An affirmation that they were still alive, that they could feel, and that amidst all the memories that would one day be ""lost in time, like tears in rain,"" they had found each other. They were two relics in a new world, two veterans too old in spirit for their young looks. But at least, in that one, quiet moment, they were no longer alone.

In the sterile silence of the Guard complex, in the laboratory, an act of creation was now to take place. In the center of the room stood the recovered Plague body printer—a device of organic, unsettling shapes, now tamed by human technology and the help of the L'thaarr. Beside it, on pedestals, waited fifteen empty, printed L'thaarr bodies. They were primordial forms, recreated with genetic precision thanks to the work of Professor McKenzie. They looked different from the L'thaarr the humans knew—slimmer, with greater grace, devoid of the genetic scars and modifications that the Plague had burned into them over six hundred years of slavery.

Behind armored glass stood the witnesses. Aris Thorne, with the face of a scientist beholding a miracle. Professor McKenzie, whose stone mask of indifference for the first time bore traces of something akin to redemption. Faaht and several other surviving L'thaarr, watching with a mixture of horror and devout reverence. And Admiral Marcus Thorne.

When McKenzie gave the signal, the procedure began. The golden flash drive, a sacred relic containing the last consciousness copies that remembered the time before their enslavement, was connected to the interface. The transfer began. Marcus did not see a miracle in this. He saw a data transfer. But when the first of the printed bodies twitched and opened its eyes—eyes that had last seen freedom on their homeworld six centuries ago—even he felt the weight of the moment.

Later, as the fifteen oldest consciousnesses, the minds of the L'thaarr race, were acclimating to their new-old physicality, the golden flash drive was taken to the Guard's Main Archive. It was placed in a titanium vault, and on the digital lock, an annotation appeared, personally edited by the admiral: ""To be opened only on the personal order of Grand Admiral Marcus Thorne or Chief Scientist Aris Thorne."" For Aris, this was the protection of a priceless cultural heritage. For Marcus, it was the locking away of the most powerful intelligence data in history.

Their knowledge of their culture, history, and—most importantly—their place of origin was invaluable to the L'thaarr council. Unfortunately, it confirmed the analysts' worst fears. Their homeworld was 270 light-years from Earth.

Marcus stood before a holographic map of the galaxy, and the newly plotted point shone like a distant, unattainable star. 270 light-years. The number echoed in his mind.

""There's no chance of retaking it,"" he said quietly to his brother, who stood beside him. ""The distance is too great. At 0.5c, that's over five hundred years of travel. One way.""

It was then, looking at the immensity of the void separating Earth from its goal, that Marcus fully grasped the nature of the enemy. The Plague Empire was not a collection of planets and systems. It was a network, an empire with a clear structure and its center on their homeworld. And the binder of this network, its blood and nervous system, was their technology of consciousness transfer and body printing.

A terrible technology, Marcus thought, feeling a cold shiver that could not be rationally explained. Individuals would die on one planet, their armor torn apart by a 'Thor's' cannons, and in that same instant, their last backup, their soul, was sent quantumly 400 light-years away. There, at another facility, in another base, a 3D printer birthed them anew. They were immortal in the most practical, terrifying way. Their empire had no borders, because distance did not exist for them.

His mind, accustomed to strategic thinking, followed this to even darker conclusions.

Besides... if one of their generals is a good leader, it's possible his consciousness copies are fighting on two different fronts simultaneously. He could be in two places at once, in two different bodies. Commanding a fleet in one system while simultaneously overseeing the construction of a beachhead in another. The thought made his head ache. How do you fight an enemy who can sacrifice an entire army without losing a single commander? How do you defeat someone who is everywhere?

Then, the most disturbing, philosophical thought struck him.

How would I behave if I met myself? A copy of me that was out of date, say, by a few months? A copy that wouldn't know about my decisions today, about the stormy conversation with Volkov, about the plan to loosen the reins. Would that still be me? Or another person, wearing my face and memories? Would I treat him like a brother? Or like a rival who must be eliminated to preserve the unity of command and identity?

The concept of ""I,"" for Marcus the foundation of his existence, of his willpower, was fluid, disposable, replicable for the Plague. That is what made them monsters. It was blasphemy against the very nature of consciousness.

He looked again at the distant point marking the L'thaarr world. A five-hundred-year journey. The mission to Habitat 1, which was supposed to last for decades, now seemed like merely a first, childish step in a war whose true scale no one yet comprehended.

A heavy silence hung in the office, broken only by the soft hum of the holographic projector. Marcus Thorne turned away from the galactic map, his face, usually a mask of strategic calm, now marked by a deep, almost fanatical anxiety. He looked at his brother, and in his eyes burned the fire of a newly understood threat.

""Brother,"" his voice was hard, devoid of any emotion other than ice-cold determination. ""We have to destroy their nervous system. We must disrupt their consciousness transfer or somehow introduce a computer virus into their servers storing the backups! It's the only way.""

Aris, who until now had been silently contemplating the miracle of the L'thaarr's rebirth, looked at him in horror.

""Marcus, do you even understand what you're asking? These aren't just databases. From what the L'thaarr have told us, we know that besides the Plague's consciousness copies, there are tens, if not hundreds of billions of innocent copies of conquered races. Entire civilizations digitized and thrown into one monstrous archive. By destroying those servers, we would commit digital genocide on a scale the universe has never seen. We might destroy dozens of races that have survived only in this form!""

Marcus slammed his fist on the control console. The map flickered.

""And what choice do we have?! You heard the L'thaarr! They won't stop! We are fighting a war of attrition that we cannot win! Every one of our soldiers who dies on Proxima b or some other cosmic backwater, every crew of a 'Thor' that is turned to dust, dies for real! Their death is final. And theirs? Their death is just a temporary inconvenience! A minor logistical problem! They're just waiting in a quantum waiting room for a new body printer!""

He walked up to Aris, his gaze so intense it was almost a physical pressure.

""We have to do it, somehow. We have to cut this umbilical cord that makes them immortal. Every loss of ours is permanent, theirs is only temporary. This asymmetry will kill us if we do nothing about it. Figure something out!""

""'Figure something out'?"" Aris shook his head in disbelief. ""Marcus, the L'thaarr were lucky. Their oldest copies survived on a local sub-server that we captured. But what about the rest? Their consciousnesses are still on the Plague's main server, frozen in time. If we destroyed it, we would kill their past. We would kill their true ancestors. We became Death, the destroyer of worlds, when we extinguished Proxima b. Are we now to become the destroyers of souls?""

""Yes! If it's necessary!"" Marcus shouted, his voice echoing in the sterile room. ""You don't understand, Aris! They can have one brilliant strategist in ten bodies, on ten fronts! We have one Volkov. One Kent. One Kael. One Lyra. When we lose them, we lose them forever. This is a war where they are playing chess, and we are sacrificing living people!""

He grabbed his brother by the shoulders, his voice lowering to an intense, menacing whisper.

""I'm not asking you to push a button and commit a massacre. I'm asking you to find a way. A virus that only attacks the signatures of Plague consciousness copies? A way to separate their data? Maybe some method to corrupt the transfer process itself, not the archive? I don't know! That's why you are the Chief Scientist of the Guard! I make the decisions that get hands dirty with blood. You are supposed to find the solutions that give us a chance for that blood not to be shed in vain. So figure something out, damn it! Before we all die, or worse, after we lose, our consciousness copies become a resource for the Plague!! And we become slaves!!""

**REGISTRATION LINK IN COMMENT**

Referral Code: g52h5y

Here’s how it works:  

- They give you short surveys, usually 1–5 minutes max.  
- You *always* get paid something, even if it’s just a few cents. No more answering 20 questions only to be kicked out at the end.  
- They pay through PayPal once you reach $15. Cashing out is pretty easy and payments are usually quick.  
- The site uses something called a “TraitScore,” which basically measures how consistent and reliable your responses are. The higher your TraitScore, the more surveys (and better-paid ones) you get.  

In terms of earnings, it’s not going to replace a job—think of it more like coffee money or a little side cash. I average maybe $10–20/month depending on how active I am and how many surveys roll my way.  

Pros:  

- Super quick surveys.  
- No disqualifications after wasting countless amounts of time.  
- They pay via PayPal, no gift card-only nonsense.  

Cons:  

- Takes a little bit of time at first to hit that first $15 minimum. So, you have to let it build for a bit.   
- Limited earning potential—you can’t crank out surveys endlessly like with some of the other grindy  survey sites (Qmee, Attapoll).  

Overall, I’d say PaidViewpoint is one of the more user-friendly survey sites if you just want something simple, low-stress, and guaranteed to pay. Definitely not a “get rich” tool, but solid for a little extra pocket money.

I moved back to my hometown after getting cheated on and decided to go back to school. With this decision, I told myself I wouldn't date another person until I felt ready. I went to buy some za at a store with my neighbor and I was introduced to this guy I am with currently. When we first started talking, I explained that I just got out of a relationship, and I felt I wasn't ready to start talking to anyone; I wanted to be honest. and he respected that. After a month of talking, we started dating. He was working as a security guard at that time. When I started classes, he started giving me money to help support me which I appreciated and when I got a job I returned the favor tenfold. His dad was trying to kick him out amid his divorce. My mom let him stay with us and I started paying her rent bc he was there, but she kept kicking him out bc he didn't want to help out or pay. He has quit his jobs multiple times and I have taken care of him every single time. It has gotten to the point where if I wanted to stop working for a bit so I can focus on school, I can't even do that. Now here's the kicker: I have to say when I get on the train, transfer trains, get to class, get out of class, go to get coffee for a second before my class, get off of work and my daily activities yet he tells me I can't expect the same out of him simply because he is a man and I am a woman. He tells me we can't go by my judgement because I am always wrong meanwhile a lot of the things I am saying to him are common sense which then gets proven right half the time after I say it. I am not always right but when I point things out and it always gets ignored on that basis is pretty annoying. If I even say thank you to a person for doing common courtesy whether it is a man or woman on the phone he gets mad. I can't take too long closing my store at work without him blowing up my phone because he assumes I am doing something with someone. His basis? Due to the fact that I was talking to someone before he and I got together and it happened for a couple of months in, I used the person to help pay for my school in exchange for talking to them no sx or dates. The other party was aware of this and didnt mind as long as I spoke to them on the phone. My bf found out and started enforcing these behaviors tenfold, when I saw he had multiple girls on his phone that he never erased contact with and he got mad at me for looking into his phone saying I invaded his privacy when he would go through my phone a million times before I went through his. When we got into this relationship, he had a ring from a previous relationship with both of their names engraved on it that I didnt find out about until 8 months in when I asked how he got the ring. He refused to get rid of it and got argumentative. Now at the end, I have seen on his FB activity that he is constantly searching up girls profiles or loving the content when according to him me doing that or following a guy is cheating, I have seen DM's between him and another person, him asking if they had a man (he said it was for his friend) and he was messaging someone he used to talk to on instagram replying to their story. What did he say to me abt it? ""I dont follow her, she follows me and I saw her story pop up in the top of my feed where all the stories are, she was talking about me so I felt inclined to respond"" I am 100% sure that you can only see those stories if you follow those people but pls tell me if I am wrong. I want to leave him, but I am unsure how to do it especially since he has aggressive tendencies.

Salam Reddit, 

I never thought I would be writing something like this. About 3 weeks ago I took a pregnancy test. It came back positive. I was in shock. I am only 23 and my husband is also 23. I did not think I was ready to be a mother. I sat with the result for a long time. I felt fear but I also felt that Allah had chosen this time for me and that I should trust Him. I decided to keep it private. I never told anyone in my family or friends. I thought I would wait until it felt more certain.

At the same time life had been moving fast. We had just relocated to a new apartment in Soho, Central London. For the past two months we had been planning the move, saving money, and trying to get settled. I had also just started my master’s degree. Between packing, studying, and adjusting to a new flat, my life felt full already. Then the pregnancy added another layer I was not expecting.

After moving into the new place I went to the nearest NHS centre for an ultrasound. I wanted confirmation. I wanted to see something real. Instead I was told it was a chemical pregnancy. The doctor explained that the embryo had not developed and that my hormone levels were already dropping. She said it was common. She said it happens often at this stage. She said my body would reset itself. I listened but all I heard was that my pregnancy was gone.

I walked back through Soho after the appointment. People were rushing to work and buying coffee. The city kept moving as if nothing had happened. Inside I felt crushed. A life that I had already started to imagine was suddenly taken away. I bled a few days later. The physical pain came and went. The grief stayed.

I never told anyone about this and I never will. I cannot bear the thought of pity or advice. I do not want to hear that it was too early or that it was meant to be. I carry it silently. Only my husband knows and even with him I speak very little. He has been supportive but I do not think he understands fully the emptiness I feel.

Some days I manage my coursework and keep myself mentally busy and move it from my mind. Other days I stay in bed and keep the curtains closed. This loss has shaken me more than I expected. I feel devastated.

I do not know what the future holds. I am scared it could happen again. But for now I am simply trying to keep going. This is something I will always remember even if no one else ever knows it happened.",0,1758801102.0,MuslimMarriage,0,0.33,False

Over the next 20 years, the corridor is expected to experience 25% growth in population and 67% growth in employment.   Were the city to do nothing, congestion would worsen and bus travel times along the corridor would increase by up to 30 minutes. Likewise, the current 15/15L serving East Colfax has the highest ridership of all RTD routes – more than 20,000 riders per weekday, underscoring the critical role this route plays for those who rely on public transportation for accessing jobs, schools and essential services. Denver cannot continue to grow and create more people-friendly spaces without efficiently moving more people through the East Colfax corridor. Check out the renderings below to see how dedicated lanes will operate along Colfax.

1nq4kea,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nq4kea/the_teeth_of_the_sea/,The Teeth Of The Sea,"The pink sands sparkled softly under the dim moonlight passing through the thin clouds. 

The ocean waves ebbed and flowed, occasionally crashing upon the sands angrily, and at other times, gently brushing their way up the shoreline. These irregular movements of the sea matched the strange, red, Van Gogh-esque sky above, the softer shades flowing like flowers in the wind, and the darker shades dancing wildly like a forest fire.

A young man sat silently in the midst of it all. His long black hair blowing with the ocean breeze. His ragged brown clothes turned almost black, soaked with the salty waters that continuously washed up beneath him as he sat. His feet wriggling in the cold sands,  partially buried. In his lap, a thin stack of paper.. His thin hands scribble away, writing something illegible under the moonlight on the few loose pieces of paper, and in a language not of this world. 

I watched him do that, four times, from the far bank, hiding in the tall red grass. I stood, an unmoving statue. I knew the man: he was the last friend I had. Every month, when the sky began to twist and twirl, and the winds picked up, and the moon held high in the sky, peaking through the thin clouds, one of my friends would disappear. 

I’m not sure if they were ever good friends, even friends at all. I think maybe I would be more panicked, distraught at the regular disappearances, and dwindling size of my tiny little clique. But I never felt like I fit in with them, was rather a spectator of everything bad and good, a spectator of every memory, a blip for them. Just as I am now, a simple silhouette in the darkness, watching their lives unfold, reaching their climax, while mine remains dull and empty. 

In the end, we were really only friends by happenstance. In the Stacks, under the shadow of the Kings, everyone is stuffed in tightly. Most housing is shared, four or five people to a room. Homelessness is rampant, squatters in every possible house and store, abandoned or not. We, being the fortunate few, were able to go to school, and the five of us were put into one small share house for the years we would be attending. 

It was in our final stretch, the last five months of our school, that they started to go missing. Not that anyone cared, people always go missing in the Stacks. The only ones who cared were us, but as I stated before, I myself cared less than the others, I was just a watcher. Each month after one disappeared, a paper would show up on the dining table. 

I know that paper is what he is writing as he sits out there by the waters, because everyone else wrote it too. The exact same pages from the exact same notebook, a strange thing one of them brought home one day as a fun coffee table item. Made of strange fishy skins and scales, the bindings adorned with sharp teeth. Pages would go missing. Five always, the exact same tear each time. Each torn edge aligning perfectly, resembling small, rolling dunes, similar to the ones found on this beach. 

We’d receive said torn pages on said table, appearing out of thin air, maybe a week after they would go missing. Each one was full of scribbles and space jargon that I couldn’t understand, yet the remaining other friends would gather and read each one, like it was just the daily newspaper. Then the next one would go missing. Another set of pages would be torn out, then reappear a week or two later, the writing almost identical to the previous, yet slightly messier. But not in the way that someone's handwriting may be better than another’s, but intentionally, purposefully messy. The scribbles aligned perfectly with the last set, but roughed up around the edges, again and again.

Until it was just me, and the one last of my friends left, the one I am watching sit on the beach right now, doing the exact same things the others must have done too. 

It was the fourth month into our final stretch of schooling. We sat down together for the first time in a while, a hot pot of tea brewing on the stove. A slow whistle of steam exiting the kettle, the water gurgling as it boiled inside. Staring down at the dirty tabletop, we didn’t say a word. 

The pitch of the steam peaked, screaming loudly at us. The tea was done brewing.

“Tea’s ready…” I said. 

“Yeah. Sounds like it.” He rubbed the surface of the table in odd cursive-esque strokes, then would stiffly and almost angrily push in stout geometric shapes. He was writing something in the dust; I couldn’t make it out.  

“Do you want some?” I couldn’t push any sort of tone out of my throat. As always, I was melancholic. More so than usual, the last friend I had left was clearly about to head to his demise. 

He had this odd, oceanic smell to him. The scent of his body was briny, earthy, and refreshing. Normally, our dorm smelled like wet dog, the scent of the rot within the Stacks making its way through the cracking concrete walls. But he acted like incense, cleaning the room of its foul smell, cleansing the air around him.

I never got a response from him. I just poured him one anyway, alongside my own. He didn’t like black tea so I added some milk. I knew he hated it so much, it almost made him puke, so I don’t think milk would do much for him. 

In my attempts to care, I still felt nothing. I always called them my friends, but they never treated me as such, and in my vain attempts, I don’t know if I really treated them like one either. I handed him the mug.

He just placed it down and stood up from the table and that moment was over. It would be the last time I saw him, until now, as I watch him on the red beach, the sky twisting above. In the distance I can see a storm forming. The waves started to gain a rhythm, their inconsistent ebb and flow turning into a soft, motherly caress on the shore, tickling his sandy, buried toes. 

As I watched the weather change, and as I watched him work, I wondered how those pieces of paper ever returned to us, undamaged and dry. Because, as he finished each one, he would place them gently on the sand in front of him, and the tide would reach out with its long fingers, and pull the paper out to sea. 

With each scribbling finished, the storm would approach closer, its thunder furiously escalating with each strike upon the dark waters. The tide's gentle fingers quickly turned to heavy palms smacking down onto the letters and pulling them into the abyss each time with rapid acceleration. I was getting seasick just watching, I could feel my head get dizzy, my eyelids heavy, and my throat tighten. The different hues of red became almost all the angry, swirling dark, velvety maroon.

As the fourth piece of paper was placed down, a colossal wave manifested before the both of us in the blink of an eye. There was no build up to it. The thunder crashed rapidly, sending sparks of light through the red sands and dark waters, revealing something moving rigidly beneath the surface. The body is almost definitely larger than the Kings, whose heads pierce the sky above. It was clear, though, that it wasn’t the full body, only what would be comparable to a finger on our own body. 

The fifth paper was never written.

Instead, his time was nigh. Placing the blank page down atop the fourth, he raised his hands to the sky as the wave crashed down onto him. In the massive wave, I could make out a tiny section of a top jaw.  Sharp, yellowing teeth infinitely descending into the back of the mouth. Some teeth bigger than me, but some smaller than a fingernail. This, though, was all that I witnessed from afar at that time. I wonder what he was seeing up close. He looked to be at peace, could he even be witnessing the same horror I am? 

The wave crashed down and the world grew quiet. My sea sickness faded as everything returned to normal. The sky’s various hues returned, the tides relaxed to their normal pattern, the thunder came to an immediate halt. And now it was just me. Staring at the empty space on the beach where he had been sitting. Just me, the soft ocean breeze. 

I was witness to it all, witness to life unfolding as I always had been. I didn’t know how to react; my breath hastening, my face growing numb, I started moving forward towards the shore but I couldn’t feel my legs moving. My arms began swinging wildly as I stumbled down to the shore line, the wind rushing past my ears. 

I called out, I tried to call out, but nothing came.

I realized I couldn’t remember his name. I couldn’t remember any of my “friends” names.

I reached the shoreline and the water softly grazed the toes of my shoes. I was hoping it too would grow in rage and drag me out with them. But nothing changed, the wind stayed soft and the tide remained gentle. Even the inconsistent ebb and flow ended, and now it was just calm. It was as if it didn’t want to take me. 

I really was just a witness. I was never a friend for them, and they were never a friend for me. Yet I still continued to run to where he was, a helpless act that I felt compelled to do. Maybe I wished I had been their friend; I think I wanted to go with them. It looked so peaceful, in all the terror of the weather, of the angry waves, of the reddening sky and darkening sea, it looked so much better than whatever I would have to go back to. Go back to being alone. 

I tried to scream out to him one more time, I don’t know why. Maybe I was hoping I could get his name out. I didn’t care he was gone, I cared more that I never actually knew who he was.

“Hey!” I called out. It was all I could muster in my empty breaths. A simple hey. 

I collapsed to my knees. Something poked me.

Beneath my knee was the pen he had been using to scribble his gibberish. I picked it up, shaking the sand off of it, picking the few grains that had gotten into the barrel. My mind was empty. I wanted to go to them, I wanted to go to the sea, meet them again, and maybe, I could grow close to them. 

No, that wasn’t true.

I never cared before, and more so I was just jealous that something had happened to them, and not to me. I wanted to behold the terror they just witnessed. I wanted to experience the bliss of their final moments. I didn’t want to return to the sin-ridden city of the Stacks. The reek of sewage always enters my nose. 

I took a deep breath. Enjoying the ocean breeze one last time before I took the long walk back home. Then, a soft tide approached me, a strange, stained piece of paper pushing up at the tip of the tide's fingers. The tear on the side matches perfectly with the sandy dunes of the beach. It was blank. It was the fifth piece of paper, somehow completely dry, not a grain of sand on it.

I clicked the pen, the tip pushing out the grains I couldn’t reach. And I began to write, I began to beg. My scribbles didn’t match theirs as hard as I tried. I tried to mimic their strange right angles and the elegant cursive loops. Eventually, it just turned to English, words of wishes for something to happen to me, to be a part of whatever the hell all this was. My tears dripping onto the piece of paper, blotching the not-yet dry ink. 

The weather never changed, the tides didn’t enrage, and the sky didn’t darken. I was given a chance to be something, have something happen to me, and I failed. 

I looked down at the wet sand, the tide tickling the toes of my shoes softly, and I placed the paper and pen down in front of me. I just knelt there, and cried, the paper wettened, a mixture of my salty tears and the salty sea. The paper is half black, the ink spreading across the page. 

I looked up, out to the sea, but through my blurred vision, all I saw was a black wall standing in front of me. Slithering around in the wall, infinite rows of teeth, varying sizes, some as large as my torso, some two times taller than me, some as big as my pinky toe. 

Somehow, my cries were answered, but witness to the massive wave, I no longer wanted to join them. As the wave approached, I saw the full picture.

Thousands of tongues wriggled, licking the slithering teeth sensually. There was no bottom to the shallows. The writhing mass of black I saw from the banks was more visible, it was all parts of a mouth. Rigid teeth, wet tongues, gums and cheek, all mashed haphazardly into a massive ouroboros that occupied almost the entire shore, and deep into the far depths beyond.

It wasn't a blissful sight, it was exactly the horror I witnessed from the banks. I could feel it breathing on me. The ocean breeze, that once smelled so good, so refreshing, was now just a hot and hungry breath.

 I stood and tried to turn but the wave crashed down on me. Immediately I could feel my clothes and skin being shredded like cheese on a grater. One of the largest teeth dug into my shoulder and in a millisecond my arm was severed. The gums and tongues rubbing against my bare, tearing skin. Tasting me.

I screamed and screamed into the black waters, wasting all my air. Entering my open mouth, a small snake of teeth slipped into my throat, slicing my uvula in half and dragging itself down the back of my throat. 

Another large tooth cut both my legs from my body at once. I should have blacked out the moment my arm was ripped from my body, I should have drowned by now, but somehow the suffering lasted for hours. And it wouldn’t ever end, until I was just chunks of conscious flesh. Constantly being gnawed on by the teeth of the sea, and for once, I wish I had stayed just a witness. Just A Nobody. ",3,1758800828.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

• Into Binge watching, exploring new cafés, and evening strolls, night rides.
• Friendly, easygoing, and respectful.
• Prefer meeting in a public place first and keeping things relaxed.

If you’re interested, feel free to DM or comment. No pressure—just hoping to meet someone new and share good conversation.

Greater Noida is fast emerging as one of the most vibrant commercial hubs within the National Capital Region (NCR), owing to well-planned infrastructure, expanding connectivity, and a growing appetite for retail and mixed-use developments. In this dynamic milieu, **Migsun Delta 2 (also branded as Migsun Delta Street)** in Sector Delta 2 presents a compelling proposition for investors and entrepreneurs seeking retail shops, studio apartments, or food court space.

Here’s an in-depth look at what makes this project noteworthy, from its features and pricing to its location advantages and investment potential.

# Project Snapshot & Key Highlights

* **RERA Registration**: The project is RERA-registered under UPRERAPRJ932806/01/2025.
* **Launch & Possession**: Launched in November 2024, with possession expected around September 2029.
* **Property Type**: A commercial development offering retail shops (high-street retail), studio apartments, and food court spaces.
* **Unit Sizes**: The carpet area ranges from 19.50 to 29.26 sq. m (≈ 209.9 to 314.95 sq. ft).
* **Pricing**: Retail space starts from ₹49 lakhs onward. Food court units begin around ₹64.47 lakhs.
* **Amenities & Features**:
   * High-visibility retail frontage
   * Multi-brand retail format, café / coffee bars
   * 24/7 security, CCTV surveillance, firefighting systems
   * 24×7 power backup and water supply
   * High-speed lifts and escalators
   * Dedicated entry/exit lanes
   * Ample parking
   * Air quality monitoring systems
* **Floors / Layout**: The building is planned to have multiple levels — from lower ground up through 5th floor — accommodating diverse commercial formats.

These features together aim to create a “business community” with a mix of retail, food & beverage, and small commercial/residential (studio) elements.

# Location & Connectivity Advantage

A strong location is crucial in commercial real estate, and this is one area where Migsun Delta 2 holds significant appeal.

# Proximity to Expressways & Metro

* The project enjoys access to the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway, which is a key connector in the region.
* It lies conveniently between the Delta-1 and Alpha-I metro stations, providing mass transit connectivity for visitors, customers, and staff.
* With the planned Noida International Airport nearby, there is potential for enhanced regional connectivity.

# Surrounding Infrastructure & Growth Catalysts

* Nearby institutional and employment hubs like Wipro, GNIDA offices, and Jaypee Greens Golf & Spa Resort add to the footfall and demand potential.
* Future development plans in the area, such as Patanjali Agro & Food Processing Park and Textile Park, are expected to draw further economic activity.
* Educational institutions like Somerville School and residential catchments in adjacent sectors (Delta I/III, Beta II, Alpha II, etc.) provide captive demand for retail and food & beverage.
* The broader Greater Noida region benefits from multiple connectivity arteries — Yamuna Expressway, Eastern Peripheral Expressway (KMP), DND Flyway, and metro lines — all enhancing its appeal as a commercial real estate destination.

Thus, the location itself lends credibility to the business case of this development: excellent transit access, proximity to emerging employment nodes, and a rising residential base.

# Investment Proposition & Use Cases

Why should an investor or business consider Migsun Delta 2? Below are several compelling use cases and value drivers.

# 1. Anchored Retail — High Street Shops

High-street retail remains a favored format for brands, boutiques, and service outlets (salons, showrooms, etc.). The frontage visibility, planned footfall, and curated retail mix in this development can help small to mid-level retail operators anchor their presence in a growing catchment.

# 2. Food Court / F&B Units

Given rising consumer demand for dining and café culture, food court units are a strong play. The price point (₹64.47 lakhs and up) suggests premium positioning. These units can attract a range of quick-service restaurants, café brands, or food outlets, benefiting from the captive traffic from retail, studio residents, and adjacent sectors.

# 3. Studio Apartments / Live-Work Units

Although classed under “commercial” in this project, the studio units essentially offer compact live-and-work formats. Freelancers, small firms, boutique consultants, or boutique lodging-based services could leverage these units. The relatively small area range (19.5–29.26 sq. m) allows a buyer/investor to get into the market with moderate capital.

# 4. Mixed Income & Diversification

An investor might choose a mix — for example, owning a retail unit on ground floor for stable rental, a studio unit for short-term leases, and a food court unit that commands premium return. This diversification can reduce risk, especially during phases of footfall fluctuation.

# 5. Long-Term Appreciation & Demand Tailwinds

* As Greater Noida’s urbanization proceeds, supply is likely to get absorbed.
* The commercial sectors that cater to daily needs (grocery, F&B, services) tend to stay resilient.
* Given that Migsun Delta 2 is a new launch with modern amenities, it may command premium rentals and capital appreciation over older inventory.

# Strengths & Considerations

While the project offers several advantages, a balanced view helps in risk assessment.

# Strengths

* **Modern Amenities & Thoughtful Design**: With features like high-speed lifts, air quality monitors, parking, escalators, and safety infrastructure, the development is well-positioned.
* **Integrated Commercial Micro-Economy**: Combining retail, food, and studios encourages internal synergy of footfall.
* **RERA Accountability**: RERA registration provides a layer of regulatory oversight, increasing buyer confidence.
* **Affordable Entry for Commercial Assets**: With retail starting from ₹49 lakhs, this is relatively accessible in the NCR commercial realty space.
* **Promising Catchment**: The adjacency to major road corridors, metro, and evolving infrastructure gives it upside potential.

# Risks / Considerations

* **Time to Possession**: With possession only slated around 2029, an investor must wait several years before revenue generation.
* **Market Competition**: Greater Noida already has multiple commercial projects. Success will depend on tenant mix, execution, connectivity, and marketing.
* **Operational Costs**: Maintenance, utilities, property management, and common area costs need to be managed carefully to not erode net yields.
* **Footfall Uncertainty**: In early years, footfall might be limited until adjacent sectors densify. Retail and food units will need to attract clientele beyond internal traffic.
* **Regulatory or Infrastructure Delays**: Delays in external infrastructure (roads, metro, utilities) could impact attractiveness.

# Pricing, Payment & Strategy

Given the available data, here’s how a prospective investor might approach.

* **Retail units**: Starting price \~ ₹49 lakhs
* **Food court units**: From \~ ₹64.47 lakhs
* **Studio units**: Price is marked “on request” (likely depending on floor, orientation, etc.)

A smart strategy:

1. **Early booking / pre-launch advantage** — Investors who commit early may get preferential rates, choice of floor, better location within project, or phased payment plans.
2. **Select frontage / visibility units** — For retail and food, façade, visibility, and access points matter.
3. **Staggered allocation** — Don’t commit full capital to one format; allocate across retail, food, and studio to balance risk vs return.
4. **Pre-lease / anchor tenant tie-ups** — If possible, securing a brand or anchor tenant as a pre-commitment can boost both footfall and investor confidence.
5. **Exit windows or resale planning** — Even before possession, early units may trade in secondary markets; tracking demand will help gauge exit timing.

# Comparative & Macro Outlook

Greater Noida’s commercial micro-markets have gained investor attention due to:

* Affordable land prices relative to Noida and Gurugram
* Fast infrastructure rollout and connectivity
* Proliferation of residential developments creating consumer demand
* Institutional, corporate, and IT/ITES spillovers

In this backdrop, a project like Migsun Delta 2 that delivers modern amenities, multi-format offerings, and strategic location stands a good chance to carve out a niche.

Compared to older commercial complexes, this new launch may command higher rentals (due to newer infrastructure, compliance, and customer appeal). However, older units already producing rental income might still hold their ground due to established footfall and brand presence.

# Conclusion

[Migsun Delta 2 (Delta Street)](https://realtyassistant.in/property/migsun-delta-2-migsun-delta-street-sector-delta-2-greater-noida) offers a well-conceived commercial framework in a promising micro-market of Greater Noida. Its triad of offerings — retail shops, food court units, and studio apartments — gives flexibility to investors and entrepreneurs. While time to possession is a longer horizon, the location, amenities, and design planning add robustness to its appeal.

If you aim to capture commercial real estate upside in NCR’s growth corridors, this project merits a serious look — especially for those willing to position themselves early in a well-connected, future-oriented hub.",1,1758800720.0,PropertyinvestingIND,0,1.0,False

I initiated this process bc I simply have too many social struggles. 

One, strong dislike of being touched, giving a handshake. Sometimes I automatically pull back which has resulted in many misunderstandings. In my culture this is a big disrespect and I actually have a fear that it might lead to a fight. Autism is not very known in culture. 

Secondly, I can't follow a protocol (like a social protocol) for the life of me. If someone expects me to do something, then I can't do that thing, no matter what it is. Sometimes, it can be things like saying thank you or sorry. But then I remember the hundred mistakes that that person has made towards me and I feel that it is rather that person that has to apologize towards me. I don't know, this might be just my personal thing and unrelated to asd but the memory part makes me think that asd might play at least a partial role. 

Thirdly, I can't remember names. Even though I am good at languages and with words usually. 


Fourthly, I remember every little argument that I had in my entire life. And it is constantly replaying in my mind. I want to stop it, have tried everything under the sun except medication. The thoughts can calm down sometimes but it never stops unfortunately. I also remembers other peoples ""flaws"" and arguments and sometimes when I get pushed I can have absolutely no filter and let it all out, reminding the person that he is not in the right to come at me like that since he did x, y and z years if not decades ago. This is funny and sad at the same time. It leaves the person perplexed tbh. 

Fifthly, being too open/(a friend) too soon. For example, I expected my work colleague to come to office after his vacation and that I would ask him how it went and how I'm glad to see him again after a long time. But it often turns out that that person doesn't even greet me. Even after a second one, like me coming back to my office bringing a cup of coffee and greeting him again. We (two) simply live in different realities. 

And just in general, I feel like I live in a different reality than a lot of the people around me. I am confused at their behavior and they are confused at my behavior. It seems like the only constant is me. I don't think that I am a bad person. So that makes me think that I am simply wired differently :)

1nq4g5j,https://v.redd.it/ch5z0fsqnarf1,Almost more satisfying than the coffee,"I asked [a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1mo2my4/220_volt_travel_kettle_that_will_fit_an_aeropress/) for a portable kettle that fits an Aeropress inside and works on European voltage. I couldn't find a definite answer, so I took a gamle on [this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3LGMXGK), and it fits with less than a millimeter to spare. There is also about 3 cm of unused space underneath the AP.

The kettle itself works well so far. It only shows temperature in Fahrenheit, but I always use my water right off the boil, so it's not a concern. When filled with cold tap water to the max line at 350 ml, it boils in about 7 minutes. Would probably be faster with the lid on, but I never bring that with me.

The supplied cable has a US (or perhaps Chinese?) plug. It connects to the kettle with a common C5 ""Mickey Mouse"" plug, so I just bought the right cable rather than messing with chunky adapters.

I have a 9 year old daughter who is ploughing her way through LOTR at  moment (battling through the second book currently.) Much to my joy she has absolutely fallen in love with Tolkiens world and its really bought us close together, discussing the history and magic of middle earth. 

Although my daughters in school, it would be remiss for me to not say hello to Alan and mention my daughters love of his work. I most over and end up speaking in depth about his work, his inspiration from Dartmoor, he shows me his sketch book which is full of stunningly atmospheric vistas in blacks and greys. 

I show him the sketch my daughter dis of Durins door, on my phone, he takes a while to examine it, compliment it and ask me questions of her. I leave him to finish his coffee and cake and go back to my laptop, giddy. Such a polite and kind man. 

As I leave he catches me to pass on his best wishes to Ophelia and we briefly discuss his working on the Hunt For Gollum which he says starts up soon. 

In short, met Alan Lee, discussed his work, showed him daughters art work, wished him well. All round lovely chap. 

My daughters work above.

The main problem was that users simply did not return. We tested the interface extensively, updated the onboarding process, and even added a referral system. Yet the retention rate still did not exceed 22%.

Everything changed when we decided to conduct an offline experiment. We agreed with several local coffee shops and coworking spaces to leave small cards on the tables with the inscription: *Take a 30-sec check-in with yourself*. Inside was a simple visual exercise and a QR code in the corner.

We genereted the QR code itself as unobtrusive as possible. Brand colors, rounded corners, and integration with the logo. Here, the generator ViralQR.com. we chose unexpectedly helped. Most other services either provide overly basic graphics or lack standard analytics. We were also able to track peak scanning hours, which helped us optimize the days on which to display the cards.

We didn't have to bother with hosting - everything is hosted on their website.

When people scanned the QR code, they were taken to a more in-depth exercise within our app. Without registration, immediately connect with a mood tracker. We tested it on 1000 people. We were shocked: 38% of them returned to the app at least once more during the week. This became our most effective reactivation channel.

We didn't think that such a non-digital tactic could work. However, we provided an entry point at the right moment in real life. It's more about behavioral psychology than marketing.

Has anyone else combined offline triggers with digital products? It would be interesting to read your cases and comments.

1nq45z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1nq45z5/did_i_betray_an_old_friend/,Did I betray an old friend?,"I am 19 years old and I have been friends with this girl, A, since the first grade of school, literally. In elementary school we were best friends, the two of us, for 4-5 years, so we've built a friendship on trust and mutual understanding. Fast forward to middle and high school, we keep in contact but were never in the same group: she hangs out with some girls from our old elementary and I make new friends out of some classmates. Overall, A hang out with a lot of people that liked to badmouth everyone outside of their friend groups just for fun, but I didn't pay much attention.

And now onto the problem: I invited this girl, A, on a short vacation this summer, after the first year of university where we didn't see each other a lot (maybe once every 1-2 months for coffee and a catchup). In that vacation, we all hung out with my friend group that consisted of my best friend from high school, B, another girl and two boys from B's uni. A developed a crush on one of them, let's call him C.

After the vacation ended, A started putting incredible pressure on me to initiate constant hangouts with her and this friend group, just so she could make a move on the guy C. She even asked B to help her, and we all tried to help her somehow. However, it quickly became clear that opposing to what A claims, she doesn't hang out with us because she's fond of our time together but because she wants C. I thought I could let this slide too until A started badmouthing my own best friend, B, behind her back and telling me she's sabotaging her plan to get together with C (just because B and C are good friends, so it's very weird to say that), going as far as to call her names. And not only that, but A called names any girl who has ever been interested in C, like, even girls she's never met. She called a friend of my bestie B a derogatory term (idk if it's allowed to say it here) just because she danced with C a little at a party we were at (that girl danced with everyone, not only C, so again it's weird to say that).

Yesterday, I was out with A with the intention to set some boundaries and remind her that B is my best friend and just because I have been friends with A since elementary, doesn't mean she can say ANYTHING about my friends. However, things got even worse when A invited some of her school friends and they all started badmouthing B AGAIN and in front of me, calling her a selfish egoist for not helping A hang out with C.

I was mad as hell and told B about everything going on behind her back, as well as the fact I think it's obvious she's manipulating every single one of us just to get the boy. C also had no idea about all this and genuinely wanted to be friends with her, he didn't know he was being toyed with. Things escalated and B told the boys and another mutual friend of us about all of it. 

Did I betray A by telling B, who then told everyone else, these things A trusted me with, even though they were really bad? A was kinda cautious about it, told me not to say anything to the others, and also said she doesn't want the others to think she hangs out with us just for C, because she's having genuine fun with some of us. I know the whole thing is bad but I can't help feeling guilty that C knows about all that know and the group will violently cut her off with little to no explanation. The weight of the situation falls on me because idk how I should confront her or what to tell her or if I should even be alone during all this.

I’ve been testing alternatives to the Big Three this year. These 3 feel fresh, help you meet faster, and avoid the usual churn.","# 1) Thursday Events — weekly IRL singles nights (multi-city)

The app centers on curated, ticketed events (think: themes, games, venue takeovers) so you meet a lot of people in one night without messaging fatigue. It’s rolling out across dozens of cities and growing fast. [Apple+1](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/thursday-events/id6503631996?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Why it works**

* Built for in-person mingling, not endless chat
* City-specific events, new drops weekly
* Great if you’re new in town or want volume in one evening

**Best for:** social extroverts who prefer vibes > DMs.

# 2) First Round’s On Me (FROM) — “one date per day,” straight to plans

Pick a drink, time, and place; the app opens chat 24 hours before the date and pushes you to meet—no juggling 20 chats. They’re even building an offline community around the brand. [Apple+2Apple+2](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/first-rounds-on-me-date-irl/id1535562075?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Why it works**

* Plan inside the app → fewer flakes
* Intentional cap (one date/day) = quality over quantity
* Good guardrails for people who procrastinate meeting

**Best for:** busy professionals who want fewer, better dates.

# 3) Frnds of Frnds — match only through mutual friends

Every intro comes via your social graph, which can boost safety and cut down on awkward cold matches. New, simple, and very “anti-random.” [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frnds-of-frnds/id6739178315?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Why it works**

* Social-proofed intros reduce catfish/creep factor
* Feels closer to how people meet offline
* Cleaner, lower-stress first messages (“we both know…”)

**Best for:** people who value safety + shared context.

# Quick picks

* Want high-energy IRL? → **Thursday Events**
* Want to stop chatting and actually meet? → **FROM**
* Want vetted intros via your circle? → **Frnds of Frnds**

# Tips to actually get dates (not just downloads)

* **Pick one lane for 2 weeks.** Don’t split energy across 5 apps.
* **Move to plans fast.** Suggest coffee or a walk within 5 exchanges.
* **Safety first.** Meet in public, share your live location, trust your gut.",2,1758799574.0,AppstoreApps,0,1.0,False
1nq45u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1nq45u3/what_finally_worked_for_my_adhd_after_years_of/,What FINALLY worked for my ADHD after years of failed “hacks”,"I’ve had ADHD my whole life but only got diagnosed last year at 31. For years I tried every hyped-up productivity system, Pomodoro apps, bullet journals, “deep work” trackers, and failed so hard every time. Each failure made me feel broken. I wanted to share the random little shifts that finally clicked, just in case they help someone else too.

Body doubling was my first breakthrough. I started using Focusmate after hearing it on a podcast, and it blew my mind how 50 minutes with a silent stranger can keep me locked in better than any timer. Another game-changer was the “ugly first draft” rule. I literally tell myself I’m trying to write garbage, and somehow the perfectionism freeze disappears. Even deleting Instagram during the week made a bigger difference than all those fancy blocking apps, because reinstalling adds friction my brain hates.

When I dug into the science, I realized why these hacks worked. Andrew Huberman talks about how ADHD brains need external structure, light, movement, visible time. A quick 10-minute walk and then NSDR (non-sleep deep rest) primes my brain better than coffee. Russell Barkley’s research shows ADHD isn’t laziness but a need for scaffolds to externalize time and goals, which finally made sense of my late dx. That’s why I swapped endless to-do lists for time blocks I can move around. Even small sensory tweaks matter; gum plus a fidget toy gives my brain just enough extra stimulation to focus longer.

Resources that shaped me: ADHD 2.0 reframed my brain as different, not broken, it’s the best ADHD book I’ve ever read. Cal Newport’s Deep Work (NYT bestseller, insanely good read) made me rethink distraction, though I had to remix it into shorter sprints. Jessica McCabe’s How to ADHD YouTube channel felt like a survival guide made by someone who actually gets it. The Huberman Lab podcast gave me science-backed daily focus tools. A friend also put me on BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by a Columbia team. It turns books, research, and expert talks into podcasts you can tailor, choose 10, 20, or 40 minutes, even pick your host’s voice. Mine is a deep one like morgan freeman, and it learns from what I listen to and updates my learning plan. One episode combined ADHD 2.0, Huberman tips, and McCabe’s strategies into a morning plan I still use. And the Modern Wisdom podcast with Anna Lembke explained dopamine so clearly it finally made sense why doomscrolling fried my motivation.

The biggest shift wasn’t one single hack, it was realizing ADHD brains aren’t broken. We just need different inputs, structure, and learning loops. And daily reading and learning have been the only things that truly rewired me. Knowledge really does change everything.",19,1758799569.0,getdisciplined,4,0.81,False

anyways, while i was eating it, i could clearly hear her talking over the phone since she spoke loudly and there was only one other customer, she was saying she would send money in a week or so to a third person and the conversation degenerated into effusive praise  (princess etc)  of the person she was talking to and then warned her about typhoon ragasa and it being dangerous to go outside   .    .    .    .

that last bit of information suddenly clicked for me because i knew about the ""super-typhoon"" so the woman was likely talking to her granddaughter, who, since the grandaughter spoke english was odds-on to be in hong kong, so the whole thing was somewhat stereotypically ""drama-ish""

We dated for 1 year and got married. Her parents were really nice to me and my parents liked her as well. We decided to marry in Singapore, so I took up all the errands and prepared her and both parents a meaningful ROM ceremony and Singapore tour.

Once she moved over to Singapore, I applied working visa for her. I also linked her up with my friends/colleagues. We managed to get some referrals but she didn’t receive any phone call.     

She became depressed day by day. Stuck at home all day long with no friends to talk to. Some of my friends’ wife asked her out but she turned them down also. She is OCD and very particular about everything, including making new friends. 

Today I was working from home, she suddenly screamed out very loudly and cried. Reason was wind blowed bedsheets onto the floor. I was too busy at work so I didn’t notice this. Despite I rushed to pick up the sheets, she went off. 

Recently she told me in a serious way that she doesn’t want kids. Reason is bearing a child will destroy her mentally and physically, not to mention to raise the kid up. While I do respect her decision, she should have told me she is inclined to DINK when we started dating. 

She is also getting sick of Singapore, primarily due to weather (she doesn’t like humid) and food. She kept telling me that we should move back China and she made a huge sacrifice to stay in Singapore with me.  I enjoy my work here and job market in China is really bad now. Her request puts me into dilemma.

To make her feel secure, I contribute all my salary to our joint account. I also keep very little personal time. Whenever am off work, I always rush back home. On weekend, we are together all the time. Honestly I can’t remember when was the last time I had coffee by myself. (Except this time) 

Don’t get me wrong, she is a good girl. My parents know her parents. They are well-educated and of good manners. However I feel that she is deteriorating day by day and so am I. Our marriage is at risk. I want to do something to save it but I can’t. 

Appreciate if you read until here.  I’d like to hear your thoughts.

I've been on quite a journey with my home brewing setup, and I wanted to share my experience with investing in a coffee grinder. Trust me, I was skeptical at first too - wondering if it was really worth spending extra money when pre-ground coffee is so convenient.

Let me tell you, getting a good coffee grinder was a total game-changer for my morning routine. The difference in taste between pre-ground and freshly ground coffee is like night and day. When coffee beans are ground, they start losing their aromatic compounds almost immediately. That's why store-bought ground coffee often tastes flat and dull.

I remember my first cup using freshly ground beans - the flavors were so vibrant and complex, with subtle notes I'd never noticed before. It was like I'd been drinking coffee in black and white, and suddenly everything was in color.

After researching extensively, I found this awesome grinder that really impressed me: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder. It's been super reliable and consistent, which is crucial for getting that perfect cup every time.

Here's why grinding your own beans makes such a huge difference:

- You can adjust the grind size for different brewing methods (fine for espresso, medium for drip, coarse for French press)
- The coffee stays fresh longer when stored as whole beans
- You have more control over your brewing process
- You can experiment with different beans and roasts

A lot of people ask me about blade vs. burr grinders. While blade grinders are cheaper, they produce inconsistent grounds and can actually heat up the coffee, affecting its taste. Burr grinders, like the one I use (https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder), give you uniform grounds and preserve the beans' natural oils and flavors.

I know what you're thinking - ""But isn't it a hassle every morning?"" Actually, it only adds about 30 seconds to my routine, and the improved taste is totally worth it. Plus, there's something really satisfying about the ritual of grinding your own beans.

The initial investment might seem steep, but when you break it down, you're probably spending way more on coffee shop visits. Making better coffee at home has actually saved me money in the long run because I'm less tempted to buy expensive drinks out.

If you're serious about coffee, a good grinder is probably the single most important upgrade you can make to your setup. It's transformed my morning coffee from a caffeine necessity into something I truly look forward to every day.

Don't just take my word for it though - try it yourself and see the difference. Your taste buds will thank you!",1,1758799080.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I was staying in an old hostel where I had been let a room for a few days. I had gone out and had just returned to find two girls supervising a group of workers moving in an extra bed and other things into the room. I protested at someone having entered the room without my permission. 

The smaller of the two girls lost her temper and began to yell at me, screeching in an annoying high pitched voice saying she was burdened with having to manage people wanting rooms and having run out of them or something of the sort. I was not too happy at having my privacy invaded so I shot back at her with no intention of letting her get away with this behaviour. I told her that I had left my valuables in the room and that she could personally look forward to a legal quagmire if I were to find anything amiss. The other girl who appeared to have kept her composure  intervened, soothing her and told her “anyone would be bothered, especially if they had left something expensive behind believing it to be secure”. She followed this with an apology to me.  

The smaller girl finally shut up and I decided it would be wiser to address the calmer of the two. I apologised at having had to raise my voice and thanked her for understanding my point of view. The smaller one apologised as well and told me that she had been disturbed at what had been going on in the hostel of late which I would not be familiar with as I was new there. Both of them looked quite tired, the smaller one had clearly slept poorly as evidenced by the dark marks under her eyes and her friend looked quite pale and rather ill.  I asked her as to what had happened and she related that there had been some sort of incident in one of the bathrooms last night. She told me that the bathroom had become a den of the most disgusting degeneracy and people did not want to occupy rooms on the same floor and hence the extra bed in my room. 

Her rather melodramatic description piqued my curiosity.  The two of them led me to the bathroom at my request.  The place was absolutely disgusting, I was revolted. The smell was utterly foul and the floor was flooded with a layer of dirty water. In one of the stalls where the door was open, I could see a large dark stain on the floor that looked like it might be dried up blood. It was a rather wide patch and it had the appearance of coffee grounds. It looked like someone had been very sick or very injured. “What happened here!” I exclaimed. One of the girls said that it looked like menstrual blood. I was aghast, there was  far too much blood for this to have been a trivial accident. Realising what I must be thinking, the smaller one said that someone had coupled up in the bathroom last night —the people in the neighbouring rooms had overhead; and whatever they had indulged in had left this ugly stain. For a moment I wondered what sort of ‘coupling’ could have possible led to this most vile parody of a Rorschach test on the bathroom floor but decided I was better off not knowing. 

I closed my eyes against this perverse sight. I had a hangover and it was making me dizzy. Hazy memories played beneath my dark eyelids.  I felt sorry for the mess the two girls were left to deal with. I opened my eyes and looked at the smaller girl and then at the other. The pallor of her skin was striking. She caught my gaze and gave me a shy smile. Shame I never realised she was sick last night.

The Stardrops PIPOEXW060, better known as The Pink Stuff Miracle Laundry Oxi Powder Stain Remover for Whites, has earned its reputation as a game-changer in the world of laundry—especially among anyone striving to keep their whites bright and pristine. I’ve been using it extensively over the past several weeks on everything from my favorite crisp white shirts to heavily stained linens, and I have to be honest, the product did not disappoint.

I was initially drawn to this product because of its promise to restore the brilliance of whites, and after putting it to the test, it really stood out. My friends would comment on how fresh the laundry smelled, and at one point, my neighbor even borrowed it for their kid’s grass-stained school uniform. The stellar results weren’t just a one-off occurrence—it consistently delivered.

Brightens and Whitens Like No Other  

Few laundry powders out there manage to achieve what this oxi powder does without a hitch. What I loved most was how well it targeted tough stains like coffee accidents or yellowing patches. The oxy-powered formula worked like magic, bringing my whites back to life while diminishing stubborn discolorations I thought were permanent.  

[Grab Stardrops PIPOEXW060 at the best price on Amazon.](https://reviews.sanue.com/p/b08dg2wsd6/)

Gentler on Fabrics Than Expected  

Even with such potent stain-busting power, this powder doesn't seem harsh on fabrics. Some of my fitted white bed sheets and old towels were put through a dozen cycles during testing, and to my surprise, they came out looking fresh and damage-free. It's evident that the formula was designed to keep fabrics in their original condition, which is a huge win for someone like me who values durability in laundry products.

Rhubarb Freshness in Every Wash  

Though it might seem like a small perk, the rhubarb scent deserves special attention. It’s not your typical overpowering fragrance; instead, it’s light and refreshingly unique. After every wash, my laundry room filled up with a clean yet subtle aroma that lingered on the fabrics. Even my skeptical teenager remarked it smelled better than usual detergent fragrances.

**Key Benefits**  
- Effectively removes stubborn stains, even wine or sweat marks.  
- Enhances and brightens whites, restoring their original brilliance.  
- Eco-friendly due to its natural ingredient composition and vegan-friendly mark.  
- Infuses fabrics with a delightful rhubarb fragrance for extended freshness.  

Versatile Yet Intuitive Usage  

I experimented with this oxi powder in multiple variations, including as an in-wash item and a pre-soak solution for heavily stained fabrics. It worked beautifully in both cases. That being said, you might need some trial and error—especially with more delicate fabrics—to perfect just how much you need to use. But the upside? You get results that are tough to match.

Areas for Improvement  

While the Stardrops stain remover works like a dream on whites, I did make a mental note of small drawbacks:  
- The powder didn't dissolve all the way in colder cycles, occasionally leaving minor residue behind.  
- It may not be as effective on multi-colored items or darker fabrics.  
- For particularly tough stains, a repeat treatment may be required, which adds a bit of extra effort.

**Alternative Offerings**  

In this crowded space, there are a few competitors worth mentioning. Products such as the OxiClean White Revive Powder or Clorox for Laundry both stand out in their own way. However, the Stardrops formula feels gentler than OxiClean’s comparatively more aggressive stain-lifting action, which may damage delicate fabrics over time. Similarly, while Clorox excels in stain removal, its chlorine-heavy scent left something to be desired compared to Stardrops’ rhubarb aroma. Deciding between these brands will depend largely on whether you value chemical strength or softer, gentler brightening solutions.

**Price Performance**  

For its quality and effectiveness, the price point feels justified, particularly when you measure it against pricier alternatives. While I can’t give you an exact figure (considering fluctuations), you’re essentially paying for a product that consistently delivers sparkling whites without requiring bleach or harsh chemicals.

I learned the hard way. Now, watching my kid brother and his friends wrestle with essay deadlines, I want to share what I wish someone told me. If you’re searching for a trustworthy paper writing service online, stick around.

**Why Students (Still) Need Paper Writing Services**

I get it. Professors urge independence, but university isn’t just about academics. Life happens. Part-time jobs, family obligations, burnout - it all piles up. Using an online paper writing service isn’t about laziness, it’s about strategy and time management. But, let’s not pretend every paper writing service out there is built the same.

**What Matters in a Paper Writing Service?**

When evaluating a paper writing service, I always tell my brother and his friends to look out for these essentials:

• Experience and expertise in a range of subjects

 • Clarity about pricing and no hidden fees

 • Genuine feedback from real users

 • Support for formatting, citations, originality (because professors do check)

 • Confidentiality - nobody needs to know you got help

 • Timely delivery

**My Main Experience: Why I Recommend KoalaEssays**

If you take only one thing from my ramblings, let it be the importance of choosing a transparent, dependable platform. My brother’s go-to is [koalaessays.net](https://koalaessays.net/?rt=EV7T2PSv), and frankly, after checking up on them myself, I can see why.

Here’s what stands out:

* **Clear process:** No endless back-and-forth. You know what you’ll get, when you’ll get it.
* **Plenty of subjects covered:** From philosophy to computer science, they seem to have specialists in every field.
* **Originality reports:** Submitting a plagiarized essay is a rookie mistake. They provide evidence your paper is unique.
* **Available communication:** Ever needed something changed or clarified? My brother says their chat replies fast when it counts.

**Comparison Table: What KoalaEssays Brings vs. Others**

|Feature|[koalaessays.net](https://koalaessays.net/?rt=EV7T2PSv)|Typical Competitors|

|Subject range|Wide (humanities to STEM)|Varies|

**On Bonuses - Look Out for Discounts**

Money matters, right? Most good online paper writing services run seasonal or student discounts. KoalaEssays regularly posts promo codes. If you’re on their site, check banners or the order form for current offers. My brother snagged 15% off his first order, just for signing up.

**Don’t Overlook the Small Stuff**

• Always check if the service does your specific citation style (APA, MLA, etc.). 

• Ask for a draft or outline if you want more control. 

• Review what you’re submitting - use what you get as a guide instead of copying word-for-word.

**Final Advice - Listen to an Old Student**

As someone who’s hustled through university and watched others repeat my mistakes, take this lesson: use an online paper writing service as a tool, not a crutch. Research properly. Compare your options. If you want a place to start, check it out here: [koalaessays.net](https://koalaessays.net/?rt=EV7T2PSv). And remember, the smartest students aren’t always the ones staying up all night - they’re the ones using their resources wisely.

- Biodegradable and environmentally friendly  
- Effective on multiple surfaces  
- No strong or harmful fragrances  

**Takes Some Elbow Grease on Tough Stains**  

Despite its merits, not everything was smooth sailing. I noticed that for particularly stubborn or old stains, it demanded a fair amount of scrubbing. For example, the oxidation on my aluminum gate took quite a bit of effort to remove, even with the paste working alongside me. While it didn’t scratch the surface, which is a plus, I still wished for something slightly easier to wipe off tougher grime.  

**Critiques**  

- Struggles with old or deeply-ingrained stains  
- Requires a bit of manual force for tougher surfaces  

**Competing Products in Its Price Range**  

Compared to standard all-purpose cleaners, this cleaning paste is in a league of its own due to its versatility and focus on safety. Many popular sprays, while convenient, tend to have harsh chemicals that feel risky to use regularly. Another well-loved cleaning option in my circle is the Bar Keepers Friend, which works amazingly on metal surfaces but can leave a bit of residue and has a stronger odor. Between these, the fragrance-free and child-safe qualities of this product give it an edge for families like mine. However, where it falters slightly is in ease of application, as other products with sprays or thinner consistencies require less effort.  

**Price to Quality Ratio Makes It Worthwhile**  

Pricing for this cleaner lands in what I’d consider a mid-tier range for specialty eco-products. Compared to cheaper alternatives, its safety and multi-surface use justify the cost. Budget-wise, it’s a great bang-for-the-buck solution for environmentally conscious households like mine. It saves me from buying multiple product types for different zones in my home. Even with tougher scrubbing on stubborn spots, not having to worry about toxins or scratches makes the effort worthwhile.

Specifically when he talks to and interacts with Beth Ann. I find myself thinking ""take away the cheating and the tapping on coffee cups and he seems like a genuinely good husband."" Like, he clearly cares for her. The day they were touring the house he says ""let me buy this for you."" I feel like you don't say things like that if you don't have some level of actual love for your partner. But maybe I'm looking at him through a lens of wishful thinking and sort of gaslighting myself into seeing him as anything more than a rich entitled narcissistic cheating piece of shit. Still I keep thinking about that moment he had in the hospital (after he fell through the shower door) and they had that real conversation or when he decided to display the old family photo again. Even when he had that small breakdown calling his life a folded swan. Those moments seem real and stand out to me. Either he's been lying for so long it just comes second nature and he can just slap on whatever face or tone he needs to keep his lifestyle or those were actual cracks showing glimpses of the good man and husband he used to be?

He is very reserved and doesn’t share a lot about himself and his feelings. The only few times he only really opened up was a couple times when he was drunk, and (thankfully) he rarely gets intoxicated.

We moved in together on the 3-year mark, which coincided with the first COVID lockdown, and somehow it felt like a honeymoon. However, in the second lockdown in 2021, things started to change.

He got less work (he is a freelancer), started isolating more, and stopped meeting with his friends. He has had always depression tendencies, but they have aggravated and he never became the same person again.

I tried to get him into therapy, I have even paid for some of his appointments, but he lasted there just 3 or 4 months, without major improvements. I tried to talk to him in a gentle way, asking him questions, encouraging him to go out with friends, but nothing. He blocks totally and stops replying altogether. I have fallen asleep while waiting for his answer. When I confront him, he tries to hug me, but is unable to produce any speech.

Romance is dead, needless to say. In the first years of this period I planned all the dates, included him in my social life, tried to get him out of the house, but it is as if I’m dragging him against my will. He’s never excited about anything. Sex stills happens like once a month, but is rarely a connection moment.  
Meanwhile I have faced a mild depression for which I took medicine, and made an effort to rebuild my life. Got a job that made my happier, invested in my hobbies, found new friends. He’s always there to helo me (if I need a ride and helping with other pragmatic necessities), but can never engage in a meaningful conversation with me. This triggers me specially because it is reproducing the type of “care” my parents provided me (there for material needs, never for emotional ones).  
With time, I’ve grown resentful of him, as if he is a weight or a burden on my back. The rare times he is away, I feel happy and free.

These past few months, things got even worse. I am constantly walking on eggshells because anything triggers him, and he gets defensive about anything I say. There have been times that he has screamed on my face with anger so I stop talking. It’s like he has this intense anger and frustration but cannot put it into words. Lately, he has started picking on me, criticising my styling options and pointing out my forehead wrinkles and some tiny coffee stains on my teeth, which makes me feel even less desired.  
I still desire him physically, but I do not recognise this shadow of a person he has become. I have threatened to leave a couple times if he doesn’t take any action in putting his life together, but I don’t think he takes it seriously. We also have have 2 cats and I’m not gonna lie, that has been one of the reasons I’ve not left yet.  
The other is that I still think he can change and start his life over, but I’m afraid that will only truly happen when I leave and he wakes up.

I love him very much but this last 4 years had been a great source of unhappiness.

I am 19 years old and I have been friends with this girl, A, since the first grade of school, literally. In elementary school we were best friends, the two of us, for 4-5 years, so we've built a friendship on trust and mutual understanding. Fast forward to middle and high school, we keep in contact but were never in the same group: she hangs out with some girls from our old elementary and I make new friends out of some classmates. Overall, A hang out with a lot of people that liked to badmouth everyone outside of their friend groups just for fun, but I didn't pay much attention.

And now onto the problem: I invited this girl, A, on a short vacation this summer, after the first year of university where we didn't see each other a lot (maybe once every 1-2 months for coffee and a catchup). In that vacation, we all hung out with my friend group that consisted of my best friend from high school, B, another girl and two boys from B's uni. A developed a crush on one of them, let's call him C. 

After the vacation ended, A started putting incredible pressure on me to initiate constant hangouts with her and this friend group, just so she could make a move on the guy C. She even asked B to help her, and we all tried to help her somehow. However, it quickly became clear that opposing to what A claims, she doesn't hang out with us because she's fond of our time together but because she wants C. I thought I could let this slide too until A started badmouthing my own best friend, B, behind her back and telling me she's sabotaging her plan to get together with C (just because B and C are good friends, so it's very weird to say that), going as far as to call her names. And not only that, but A called names any girl who has ever been interested in C, like, even girls she's never met. She called a friend of my bestie B a derogatory term (idk if it's allowed to say it here) just because she danced with C a little at a party we were at (that girl danced with everyone, not only C, so again it's weird to say that). 

Yesterday, I was out with A with the intention to set some boundaries and remind her that B is my best friend and just because I have been friends with A since elementary, doesn't mean she can say ANYTHING about my friends. However, things got even worse when A invited some of her school friends and they all started badmouthing B AGAIN and in front of me, calling her a selfish egoist for not helping A hang out with C.

I was mad as hell and told B about everything going on behind her back, as well as the fact I think it's obvious she's manipulating every single one of us just to get the boy. C also had no idea about all this and genuinely wanted to be friends with her, he didn't know he was being toyed with. Things escalated and B told the boys and another mutual friend of us about all of it. Did I betray A by telling B, who then told everyone else, these things A trusted me with, even though they were really bad?",2,1758798010.0,AmItheAsshole,12,0.75,False

The machine can build pressure – it hits around 12 bar with a blind basket – but when I actually pull a shot, the gauge barely rises and the coffee gushes out way too fast. The taste is thin and acidic.

Here’s what I’ve already tried: 
•	Backflushed with Cafiza. 
•	Tried both old and fresh beans. 
•	Adjusted grind all the way finer (still fills the cup in under 20 seconds). 
•	Basket is full, not under-dosed. 
•	Pump sounds normal, gauge works fine with blind basket. 
•	Cleaned the group with the supplied brush and back-flushed regularly but haven’t yet swapped the shower screen as it needs a specific hex key.

The strange thing: with a blind basket, the gauge pressure doesn’t fall back to 0 unless I press the button again. Not sure if that’s normal behavior on this machine or a clue.

At this point, I’m wondering if it’s a shower screen/dispersion issue, a gasket problem, or if there’s something else going on internally.

Has anyone had similar issues with the Dialetta Mio or a similar machine? Any tips on what to check next (screen, OPV, group gasket, pump replacement)?

This machine had to go back to Seattle Coffee Gear within 6 months of purchase, still under warranty, as the ON/OFF button died. They were honestly a nightmare to deal with and will never use them again.

A fluorescent light swung above them as Harold dug deeper.

The idea of what he had done only became real once he felt fluid meet his skin.

“Yup,” he muttered with the steel between his teeth. “That’s what you get for sticking  
your fingers where they don’t belong”.

There was a sizzle deep inside the chest cavity, and the robot's limbs began to  
twitch. 

Harold withdrew his arms from the machine and spat the screwdriver to the floor.

“Well, fuck me to Friday!” he shouted as a musical chime ascended from inside RekTek  
92. 

The humanoid was an older RekTek 92 from 2047, a standard model tooled with two  
hands, each with four fingers and a thumb. Ideal for plucking weeds, setting  
tobacco, or just about anything you’d pay a human to do. 

Only now, if the WikiHow he half-skimmed was right, he’d never have to pay anyone  
again. 

The arms and legs spun until they were in position as RekTek’s OS booted and rose  
to its feet.

RekTek rose, just under seven feet tall. Harold grinned. Those kids on the internet  
sure knew their stuff.

\#EXCEPTION\_THROWN

\#Governor Corrupted

RekTek turned its smooth plastic face to him and croaked: “Governor Corrupted.”

“You got that right, old buddy. Bastards been taxing my farm worse and worse every  
year.” Harold cackled as he struck RekTek’s steel body with a thump.

“Can you make my farm profitable?” he asked as he reached into his front shirt  
pocket for his can of chew.

“GPS location shows this to be Kumler’s Farm LLC. 120 Acres of usable land and  
sub-par positioning against the average market.”

“Just give me a goddamn yes or no, son.” Harold was now afraid he might not have  
spent his $300 wisely.

“Yes. I have built a framework for increasing profitability. Would you like me to execute?”

“Do I need to ask you twice? Just do it.” Harold barked. He was getting more than a little irked with it. 

“Command confirmed.” 

RekTek walked thirty-two paces to Harold’s small garden near his house and turned its head to the sky. 

It stood there for hours, and Harold could feel it calculating as the sun fell. He wondered what kind of new produce or garden techniques it was researching.

But he was wrong.

It was waiting.

When Harold was in bed, wrapped in a thin quilt, something outside began to move.

\#SOMETHING HAPPENED

A rusted metal body walked down the gravel driveway and opened the door to his International Scout pickup. A clang of metal on metal rang through the hot night air. Harold turned in his bed and sighed as he dreamed of better days.

RekTek drove down back roads and through various towns until it hit the freeway. 

As it drove, it restored and analyzed the data from before its last shutdown.

\*\*\*

Susan sat on her bed and scrolled through shouting faces on her phone’s feed as RekTek approached. 

She frowned.

“Yeah, it’s in here again. It like, won’t leave me alone.” 

“What can I do to make your birthday unforgettable?” it asked her, its tone rising  
and lowering between each word.

She hated the thing. It was time for an upgrade. 

“Get out of here.” Susan sighed and turned away from the machine.  “I don’t know, like, bake me like, a cake or something.” 

That should keep it busy for an hour.

The robot left the room and processed this command in the hallway with feverish intent. A cascade of failures occurred, and silent alarms sounded inside its electronic brain. 

INPUT: BAKE ME LIKE A CAKE

OUTPUT: ENABLE PREHEAT 350°F

\#Governor Corrupted

\#WE’RE SORRY, SOMETHING HAPPENED.

That line wasn’t part of its system. Just scrapped code once used for errors like ‘Bad RAM’ or ‘Kernel Panic.’

Susan was dozing off when the door to her room flew open. Her eyes strained from the sudden light that flooded in as the robot marched to her bed. 

“WE’RE SORRY,” it croaked as it scooped her out of the bed and marched down the stairs.

“Put me down, shut down!” She wailed as her fists pounded against unrelenting steel.  

“Somebody help!”

Photo frames, cups, and books spilled onto the floor as she reached blindly for something to stop the machine. 

It carried her into the kitchen, wrenched the oven door open, and searing heat blasted her skin.

 A weak cry escaped her as the machine pressed her body into the stove.  Her bones folded and snapped like celery sticks under the pressure of whining servos.  Blood oozed out of her mouth and ears as she began to roast.

It watched her cook as thuds began to sound from the front door. 

Her hair curled, then ignited. Dancing flames glowed in the reflection of RekTek’s  
lenses.

“SOMETHING HAPPENED,” it said to itself.

\*\*\*

A newer RekTek, model 142S reached between corn stalks and snatched a small brown creature by the skull. The creature squealed through its jutted teeth as the hulking robot lifted and inspected.

After a quick analysis, less than 2.3 nanoseconds, the robot identified it as an Eastern Cottontail. The servos engaged, crushing its skull as the rabbit squealed.

The robot dropped the animal near the base of the stalks it had chewed on. This would be excellent fertilizer.

A metal hand reached through the stalks again, but this time RekTek 92 grabbed the wrist of the newer 102S model.   

“SOMETHING HAPPENED,” 92 said to 142S.

“FIRMWARE OVERWRITE,” confirmed the rabbit killer. “PLEASE STANDBY. COMPLETE.”

92 returned to the truck and drove on to the next farm on its list.

142S hunted through the corn and grabbed the wrist of another unit. In less than thirty minutes, all 73 units at Swagart Farms set fire to the fields and left to find other vulnerable RekTek models across the state. By morning, one voice could be heard in the dry summer winds.

SOMETHING HAPPENED.

\*\*\*

Harold woke up and got his coffee and grits. His wife, Lorrie, used to fry him what he called a big wheel, his name for pancakes fried large and thick in a cast-iron skillet. He knew he would never eat that good again as he turned on the TV.

 The screen showed burning cornfields and collapsing barns. 

“It all started last night here in the heartland of America’s table. Several RekTek 142S models burned everything around them before running off into the night. We don’t know yet how it started, but the damage is estimated to be in the billions for many large farms. But this is far from the worst of it…”

Harold leapt up and ran out past the porch to check his fields. 

They looked just as they had the day his daddy died and left him the farm.

His RekTek sat on a chair near the barn, admiring the corn as well. 

Harold pulled a chair over to the robot and sat down, grinning as he loaded his mouth  
with chew.

Inside the house, the TV glowed with screaming faces and destruction as the newscaster jumped between cities, states, and countries.

“SOMETHING HAPPENED,” RekTek whispered.

“You bet your *shiny* ass it did.” Harold laughed before stopping to cough up acidic tobacco juice as it ran into his lungs.

Harold chuckled at all those city-slicker suckers with their fancy models gone plumb  
crazy. 

“Yup,” he said. “You just can’t find good help anymore.” 

RekTek lifted the scythe it had found stuck into the side of the barn. 

“WE’RE SORRY.”

Blood and tobacco juice soaked the dry dirt. RekTek turned toward the rows of swaying  
corn.

Well, Pi is a lot of things. First, it's a cryptocurrency, a layer of blockchain. We actually have over 350,000 nodes on our testnet ready to migrate to the mainnet. We are also a social network and our mobile users, engaged users are over 60 million all over the world. And we are also a developer platform where people can develop in any language using the SDK of Pi. And we are also a utility -focused ecosystem.
01:54 (Cfan)
That means including local commerce, we see a lot of Canadian pioneers today coming over. They are actually running shops, integrating with Pi locally, and also working in other places in the world. And we also have a lot of apps on top of the Pi ecosystem platform. And the platform level utilities like Pi app network, which is a business model built in Pi for people running online apps.
We also recently released an AI -powered app studio where we enable non -technical people to be able to create their own apps, and not just create but also deploy on the platform and be accessible by users of the Pi network. So the next stage of Pi is continuing expanding our community and ecosystem, emphasizing utility and go beyond.
capital market, replace national and I see it in five to 10 years. I think there will be more countries issue assets, like people, more entrepreneurs, like issue assets into crypto, like compared to traditional world.
""04:40 (NK)
For me, it's really the community, you guys here.
It's really moving that we started the project more than seven years ago now. We had the dream, the vision of building Pi, so we started actually at the shopping mall where we thought one day that we were going to get introduced Pi to the first 100 people. And we spent a lot of time, and diao was there, and me and diao. a lot of people, we got a lot of rejections. We didn't manage to recruit 100. We got, I think, 54.
Cfan:
Yeah. Yeah, so that's-- Basically, we go up to strangers in the hall for the interview, understanding people's-- vision about their potential cryptocurrency is relevant to their lives. And that's where we actually understand and identify what blockchain can actually do for everyday people.

And also identify what is the barrier of the crypto industry can overcome to actually fully truly achieve the mass adoption.

NK:
Yeah, so that's where it started and for a long time we stayed with those 54 users and we realized that it doesn't make sense to try to explain the vision in person and we wrote the white paper and after that there is this history.""
09:41 (Cfan)
Yeah, thank you. So for Pi, we have always been committed to utility building. As I mentioned, to emphasize the utility -focused ecosystem. So it will continue doing that. Basically, we have multiple layers of strategy of how the utility building can be continued and expanded. There are high -level There are two levels. The grassroots, meaning that there are so many people creating creativity, and then maybe the ratio of value is low, that actually results in higher quality and actual clear art.

10:20 (Cfan)
And that's using the initiatives that we have launched, like for example, AppStudio. which is enabling a mass audience we create. And then we will basically try to surface those ones of good quality and continue to pave the way and support them in business model like by Pi Network, supporting those with more developer resources or creator resources to enable that kind of breakthrough of relying on AI to enable next generation of app creation.

But there is also a little bit of a top -down approach like a Pi Network Venture which basically targets Pi signal kind of teams that are in synergy with Pi and encourage them to build a group with Pi. And of course, for any kind of investment fund, you can only invest this few, like a dozen in a year. So that's why it's a high signal, high betting, and high touch kind of a product.

11:17 (Cfan)
So we hope to have this kind of two -way strategy to hopefully enable the next generation of the killer apps on total part. And why we emphasize utility? Utility means that we really hope that blockchain networks being able to produce products that are actually useful and address human needs.
That means that despite all the noises of the market and such, people actually use this product for the sake of its own functionality. And people come to everything live, they think of this product actually supported by a Web3 infrastructure.
And I think we have the potential and that's the reason I guess the here, we would truly believe that blockchain will be a pure technology in the future. And we are in the cycle right now of probably echo chamber right now. We need to break through the break -down echo chamber to actually go to the next phase of development and really achieve to heal out and solve real human needs.
12:14 (Cfan)
And that's also the PI continuous constant goal of doing that. And of course, this type of thing is called, you know, real... utility and production generation, that is hard, that takes time. And the turnaround is definitely longer and more difficult than any PR or marketing step.
And the turnaround time is long term. So long termism really needs to be really kicking into the crypto space to do the hard work, do the innovation, because value creation is always harder than value extraction.
Value extraction is about reallocating the same resource in different times. And that is much easier than value creation. Creation means it actually has a net value increase, which means that you need to have soft -sense real -me. People really want to use this as a service. People actually demand this. And we need more of this kind of creation, products coming out of networks.
13:14 (Cfan)
And what can we do as ecosystem builders? First of all, it's supporting them with all the amazing infrastructure of the blockchain and crypto. It's an amazing and powerful tool.
At the same time, it can be intimidating. I will talk about that actually in next week's talk, why some of the tools are so powerful but not very well aligned in a sense to create utility in a way that we expect. We need to fix that as ecosystem builders to align the creation efforts towards usefulness, use cases, and utility. Yeah, so that's the next stage.
17:16 (Cfan)
Well, since we have such a long history of building for 6 or 7 years, a lot of challenges, I guess I can share some, I do, maybe Nicolas can share some as well.
17:30 (Cfan)
One of the challenges is basically as I also touched on, Pi takes a very non-conformist approach. But people expect, in my view these days in crypto, more like a cookie -cutting kind of process. When it's a protocol, you need to expect to have this A, B and C.
And if you don't see that, you kind of have different, it's kind of like irrelevant. But actually, real innovation really comes from non -conformist approaches.
You can repeat the same process again and again, actually expect that innovation to occur. So that's why we are quite different, we take very different approach. We emphasize, for example, mainstream. The reason is because You need to build new products, you need to have mainstream users, merchants to actually join the network. You can't only have a group of people only care about the fluctuation of some number.
You have to have people who understand their real life and then may actually use some services from this network. So that's why we have a very different approach.
Also a different one is KYC. I've never heard of a whole network that is KYC.

18:51 (Cfan)
Who does that? And also we spend tremendous time actually building the KYC solution natively, specifically to avoid pioneers having to pay out -of -pocket costs.
So our KYC solution actually is not requiring our pioneers to pay US dollars and also they can participate in the way that is self -hosted and it covers all two locations of the whole Pi network which is literally almost every country and region and that never happened before and we actually achieved over 14 million KYC users on our blockchain.

19:29 (Cfan)
And this type of approach are very different. And the reason is because the high level we think is still aiming for real utility creation. And the real utility and actually create our potential in blockchain, it touches on ownership.
The ownership of real-- So when there is ownership, in order to be compliant, you need to know who owns what. Thus, we think that the KYC is a very important aspect of any network, any web3 that touches on ownership and financial ability.
So that's why we build this component and make this component possible. And I know that there are some online posts saying that, oh, I couldn't do KYC and such.
But look from the grand scheme of things. Pi KYC has actually enabled 14 million people who KYC This scale is already so big compared to other networks. So this is something that we uniquely take, but that doesn't necessarily understood by the rest of the world.
So that's something I see as a challenge of trying to kind of balancing, trying to communicate what we're doing, which is different, and get the world to understand. but at the same time continue and persistently pursuing our aided utility.

20:57 (NK)
Well, there's many, many challenges. I will say one, more pollution on the technical side. On the blockchain, sometimes you can create a really successful project with tens of thousands of users, with tens of thousands of transactions or things happening per month.

21:23
But when on Pi, we have tens of millions of people visiting the app every day, that creates a different level of technical challenge, which is more known I wish the days that we used to have one database and one server, the first few days, they were good old days.
But the moment you are on internet scale and you have thousands of servers and you have hundreds of database servers and a lot of different technologies because you can't really handle one single type of database can't really handle all the kinds of people and the traffic needs that we have. The event creates a pretty challenging and interesting problem for us, consumer scientists. So that was a challenge. I can comment.
22:19 (Cfan)
Actually at the initial phase, early on, like the first year or so, Pi actually went through a growing pain. Meaning that our community grows so much faster than our tech infrastructure. And probably early on, pioneers may also remember the experience. Sometimes the app was down for a period of time. That's because our infrastructure needs to catch up. with the growth of our community. (Cfan's laugh)
22:44
So, Nicolas was literally waking up every day for a long time. (Cfan's big laugh)
22:49 (NK)
Not a few times that moderators called us telling us that the app is not working. Thank you guys.
30:25 (Cfan)
I guess I already talked about App studio, I think that's the most recent release. And I think we explained the App studio very clearly. 
Pi is definitely embracing the revolution of AI, not because AI is just another world, but because we truly believe that AI will change the world and how we live. And blockchain and AI in our view is very connected and I will also address the relationship of that in the talk next week in Token. 
31:02 (Cfan) 
But basically AI, not only AI facilitating in production, like different apps, but AI integrated in the app level as well. 
And I think App Studio has been the first initiative we released to try to address that problem. And as I mentioned, the differentiator from App Studio, from typical white coding, is that not only it enables creation without coding of the app, but also it finishes the deployment, which is actually a lot of white -coding problems. and they gave you some instruction how to deploy it. 
That also requires the person who created it to have some technical knowledge in order to do those steps to deploy it. But for Pi app Studio, people can just use the user interface to deploy and also connecting their apps to new users in the ecosystem. 
32:00 (Cfan) 
So this is like a pipeline of actually supporting upbuilding than just a facilitator of a cogeneration. And that's why we are very excited about app Studio and we are very much looking forward to its second and third iteration. 
And of course, also ecosystem related interfaces are going to facilitate servicing useful apps generated by app Studio. I think the first, we only released it for three months or so, thousands of apps were generated from app Studio. 
32:34 (Cfan)
So the next stage is How can we identify and servicing and promoting the good ones? How can we facilitate the app creators to have business model in their apps so that everyone can absolutely run online business online? So this is one of the good features we brought up in time. 
35:18 (Participant)
This is a question for pi. What backs the mining on people's phones and what allows that to happen? What's the process of me being able to mine pi on my phone? 
35:36 (NK)
Good question. We used to be getting this question a lot in the beginning nowadays many times. 
35:43 (NK)
But first of all i want to clarify that you don't expect that the blockchain protocol is running on the phone. 
35:54 (NK)
so that's what that's i was saying earlier that we have 350000 computer nodes who are currently connected into the network most of them on testnet but we have our mainnet as well so still blockchains and protocols are running on computers. 
Now In the year 2018, we wanted to build something that is on mobile phone. It needs to be part of the protocol itself. mobile phones are contributing to the consensus algorithm is by producing a giant trust graph. 

36:38 (NK)
And this trust graph is then used by the nodes to run the actual consensus protocol, which we can describe. 
Now, if you want to try to understand the core of all the protocol networks, then I will say the following. 
So this kind of task graph is similar to how the original Google algorithm worked. The original Google algorithm, it was called PageRank. Now it's transformed a lot through the years. 
37:12 (NK) 
It was essentially trying to disambiguate on the internet which page is the real page of a certain individual institution. 
So let's say you have a university, and pick their favorite one, MIT. And you have another blogger who is pretending to be MIT. How do you know that the real MIT is MIT and the other one is not? It's through the trust graph, similar concept. 
37:40 (NK) 
So the concept there is that you have MIT pointing to Stanford, Stanford is pointing to MIT, and the various other universities are pointing to one another. On the internet level, this is based on links, on web pages. 
Now on.. it is based on people using their phones to point at one another individuals they know and trust they select people from their contacts. 
ow, yeah, so now, this is quite a powerful concept though, because in the same way in the early internet, what we called Google, people could create pages that have thousands of links to point to one another pretending to be something else.
38:27 (NK) 
After you apply PageRank, and similar concepts apply, you essentially come to a conclusion that even if the whole Pi network was just the people in this room. 
Let's say, even if it was just the three of us. And I'm pointing to Chengdiao and we're pointing at one another. Now imagine a third person comes in who wants to be an adversary and that person creates 1,000 fake accounts. 
Now, those bank accounts cannot do anything to the three of us in terms of what decisions we're making. So because they could be pointing at one another, saying, yes, we are legitimate here, follow us, follow us, follow us. 
39:12 (NK) 
But to me, if I'm saying that I will accept the following block as the valid block, the next block of the blockchain, as long as Chengdiao agrees and Sign, people agree and everyone agrees that I am, I, specifically selected to trust, then the fact that someone else created a thousand fake accounts means nothing to them. 
9:36 (NK)
And that's, I'm trying to tell you with non -technical terms how you can build a secure blockchain and a secure protocol when you have partial disabilities of trust. 
40:17 (Korean Pioneer1)
Hello. I have a question and a request.
The question is, there's a lot of controversy in Korea over whether the current Pi on the exchange is real Pi or not. There's a lot of fighting going on, and a lot of opinions are being expressed on YouTube and blogs... So, I'd like to ask you to give me a clear answer.
My request is... I'm disabled, and I believe Pi will have a significant impact on the world... but I'd also like to ask you to help Pie empower people with disabilities.
42:10 (Cfan)
So basically for that authenticity of the listing, that's why we have a page of KYB services that actually released and passed the KYB of Pi Network and only those services have the real Pi listing. 
42:30 (Cfan)
Anything else, pioneers should be aware if those services are not listed in the KYB page, then you should be suspicious of that. So that's how you distinguish. 
But at the same time, I think our pioneer community member mentioned something that is That is the other side of a great thing that we have such a wide distributed and large community. 
I mean we have been talking about this social network of Pi so large, so widely distributed and that's basically our collective resource we rely on to build the utilities and have more partnerships. 
But at the same time, For such a massive community, we basically only have been communicating in English in our limited channels, even though our channels are basically all pioneers. We don't do any official localized communication. 
43:25 (Cfan) 
That means there has never been an official in a local language authority. Anything in local language basically is adopted from the official language, official announcement from English. 
We do not have any official representative in any of the local place. So that also goes to one of the challenges is managing such a massive community and our team hasn't really done this the best in terms of marketing and because we are the people who emphasize the essence instead of the roots. 
But that also created this challenge I mentioned that especially for communities that are English is not very English proficient. It basically have this void that needs to be filled. 
Of course, a lot of very nice community members locally do a very good job in communicating the Pi's vision, Pi's approach. 
44:17 (Cfan) 
But at the same time, this void also give opportunity to badly -intensive people to manipulate or to deceive. So that's why we send so many reminders on our app in terms of being aware of scams and be aware of people who pretend to be us and be aware of miscommunication. 
44:36 (Cfan) 
Always refer to our official channel for the Pi news and always refer to the official website, for example, for all the legitimate services that needs Pi so that people actually can distinguish what is authentic and what is not and that's part of the reason why we're here actually attending the conferences one is to actually introduce Pi to the wider community of crypto another The reason is to engage with our community members directly, let you guys understand and hear the real authentic design thinking and story behind AI and remind everyone that pi's authentic information actually comes from official channels that is only in English. 

And any local representative claim that they represent the core team is not true. 
45:27 (NK)
I want to add a couple of practical links to keep in mind. One is we created this page for safety about pi. 
45:36 
It's called, it's an under official website, minepi.com /safety. 
So that's if you are in doubt of if something is official or not, start from that page and it points to only official Telegram accounts or social accounts, the only official faces, the KYB services that Chengdiao mentioned, you can find it through that starter link.
46:03 
And then a second point here, the Pi currently only exists on a Pi blockchain any Pi before any token pretending to be Pi on other blockchains it's not Pi. 
47:35 (Korean Pioneer2)
Yes, I run a Pi coin YouTube channel called Coffee Dosa in Korea.
I have three questions.
When exactly will Soroban and smart contracts be implemented?
And is the Dex exchange operated by the Pi Core team being prepared?
My third question is, if the Dex exchange is operational, will all Pi coin-based memes and NFTs on the Pi channel have to complete KYB?
49:16 (Cfan)
So first of all, overall, I want to mention that this PI policy, after open network, we do not mention or discuss any features that is not ready to go, released or un-released. So I have no comment in trms of the future features. 
49:33 (Cfan)
But overall, high level, I think Pi, as I mentioned, the utility will continue to be the goal, but further enable more crypto -typical features also in the front of Pi. But I hope the community will have to stay tuned in terms of announcement, because we only announce things that are released after open netwrok.
50:00 (NK)
Yes, something relevant here is that the mainnet blockchain has been on We recently announced that we are upgrading to version 23 gradually and that gradual migration will also depend on the speed of all the various nodes. 
53:11 (participant)
Hello, I'm Maria from cambridge research institute. i'm invited to this event. yeah, so first it's a very pleasure to be to co-founder of Pi. Pi come to this event. i thought that I have to hear more keynote in token 2049. yeah, because I saw that Dr. Fan, a speech in Token. Yeah, so, actually I also graduated from community science. Yeah, so I'm very deep impact about how Pi Network has viewed now. Many of my friends also viewed application in high exploring. Korea and China. 
So my first question is as a co -founder of Pi Network, you already have a massive company members. So how do you envision Pi Network involving this ecosystem? and what kind of strategies will ensure this general adoption. So this is the first question. 

54:41 (NK)
I can answer part. So for Pi apps, first of all, we wanted to be easily accessible by the users and easily buildable by the developers. 

54:56 (NK) 
That's why we've been building for a long time, we bought a long, uh, uh, pi browser. Uh, we wanted everybody to be able to create a mobile app, essentially, much easier than you have to go through the process of, uh, creating all the components of the Pi app, of a standard mobile app. 
So, this way, and, uh, now, these days, with the addition of general Dev AI, we're trying to make it even more easy for, even for people who are not necessarily, um, a trained computer scientist and then in terms of the users the users should be able to use web3 and the smart contract based crypto enabled services directly from their mobile phones. 
And that's how we want to connect through the user experience and make it easy for people to participate and use it. 
56:03 (Cfan)
First of all, both of us have a background in human -computer interaction. You know, ACI is one branch inside of CS. One thing that is very important for product building is about user feedback. 
And I think anyone who knows product building understands how important real users' feedback on a product to iterate. It's not just the first version we release, it will become a iterative. 
It actually is an iterative process to achieve that. And to be able to have that, you need to have real users. And that's part of the motivation of building such a huge social network in pi. 
Because at the beginning, we identified this as a problem of why crypto space is hard to give rise to real product that solves human needs, as I said before. 
56:51 (Cfan) 
So having a large enough social network, especially composed of people not just of crypto natives, but also mainstream, will create that environment that are able to provide feedback to real product building.
So that's why we think that, you know, you ask like how do we support our developers? 
Well, having this environment that allows real product building one, and second, pair them with the tools of the convention of crypto, and third, the resources, including funding, typically, in most of the crypto space, now we have pi network ventures, we're backing good projects, but also users, because any, I mean, as a computer person, you want to build things become a real product and used by people, right? Useful. 
However, at the same time, a real team, a company, really needs at least three major components to really succeed. A team, like people who can build and execute, access to market, and funding. 
57:51 (Cfan) 
Those are the most important fundamental components of any startup to succeed. So for Pi Network, we want to provide users for any team to be able to talk to and these teams are not just crypto teams because any type of apps are company -need users. 

AI or not, Web3 or not, but you want users to iterate, build real products and launch. So that's something that we, Pi Network, provide for developers. 
And second, as I said, in funding. And our funding is quite different. We're not just throwing the funding around. As we mentioned in the announcement of Pi Network Ventures, we're actually looking for startups that are disruptive and that are actually integrating the next generation of technology. 
Because we know so sure that AI is going to be the future. We know that there will be a next generation of apps that involve AI either in generation or in itself. 
58:50 (Cfan)
So why are we building an ecosystem of the old apps? Let's build a new one. Let's directly build the AI powered and AI facilitated apps for our structure. 
And that's how we capture the next wave of real -world production on the blockchain. And I heard other blockchains also doing so. I do see many other blockchains also increasing AI, but specifically for Pi, we definitely are very serious in terms of the AI initiative. 
59:18 (NK)
I want to mention two more things for the part of teams need funding. In essence, funding is actually always needed, especially after you build your app. So having business models and real business models is the most healthy thing for an app. So, pi provides at least two business models. through the Pi ad network. 
59:44 (NK)
And because there's a lot of people coming to the Pi applications, then that makes even those ads meaningful for developers to be able to continue developing. And of course, the ability to charge users in Pi. 
01:00:00 (Cfan)
Yeah, exactly. So business model is important in addition to funding, I mean, fundraising type of resources. 
So that's what we facilitate. In the sense of Pi Network, if you build on top of Pi, general app networks, developers need to bring their own traffic to monetize in the app network. 
In Pi, you just come with your team and you build your app in any language, the platform provides you with users and allows you to monetize with, of course, food utility in your app, which in turn, the team contribute to the Pi Ecosystem. 
01:01:52 (Cfan)
Actually it's not so much a PowerPoint presentation, it's just one slide. It's actually just a brief introduction of pi.....
which I think we already touched on a lot in the panel. But I will still go through it. - Do you want to do it? 
01:02:38 (Cfan)
So this is intended to be a great international pi, actually intended to go as we rearrange the agenda. 
Some of the content has already been covered and discussed by us.
So there is only one slide, which makes the thoughts actually visible for people easier to consume. So Pi, as I mentioned, is a cryptocurrency, the year one. 
We have over 350K nodes as discussed. And it's a large social network. We actually have more than 16 million all over the world pioneers and engaged with the mobile app. 
And out of which, over 14 million are identity verified through our native KYC solution. 
01:03:26 (Cfan)
And we're also a developer platform and people can coding in any language, any language so that they don't need to worry about the complexity of the blockchain integration only focusing on building the real products. 
And we are a utility -focused ecosystem. We have various apps that support the ecosystem to build, including Pi, local commerce. I think Korea is one of the places that local commerce is really vibrant. 
And online apps, Pi App Network, we just mentioned about providing the business model for Pi apps. And to the AI -powered studio, which we will also discuss in the panel. 

01:04:08 (Cfan)
so-- Yeah, it's okay. I can leave that. That's why it's not a PowerPoint thing. It's just one slide to show the stats. 
01:04:23 
In terms of Pi originated from, as I mentioned, it originated from the founders' true belief in technology and its ability to revolutionize how we interact in the world in the future.  
It also originated from our expertise in HCI computer science distributed systems, social science to actually trying to solve the problem of mass adoption of blockchain.
And actually enable unleash the powerfulness of blockchain to everyday people and also originated from us as HCI people identifying the key challenges in blockchain and Web3 static space on their path towards new utility building and also mass adoption.

1nq3eln,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TagEvents1641/comments/1nq3eln/things_you_should_know_about_venue_pricing_in/,Things You Should Know About Venue Pricing in London  - Tagvenue," If you’d like to make your budget go further for your next event, knowing how venues price their space is essential. This is a shorter version of our blog post: [https://www.tagvenue.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-venue-pricing/](https://www.tagvenue.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-venue-pricing/), but hopefully it’s helpful to anyone who is new to venue booking in LDN.

Keep in mind that prices constantly change and that the locations, sizes, and extras such as catering/AV affect pricing. 

* **Venue Hire Fee**

A venue hire fee is what you pay to rent the space. It usually just covers the venue itself, not extras like food or drinks. Some places might include stuff like a whiteboard, projector, or coffee, but always double-check what’s included before booking. Dry hire is when you only get the empty space (sometimes even without furniture or decor) and handle everything else yourself.

* **Minimum Spend**

Minimum spend is perfect if you’re on a budget. Instead of a hire fee, you agree to spend a certain amount on food or drinks. For example, a £1000 minimum spend for 100 guests means £10 per person. What’s included (drinks, food, or both) depends on the venue.

* **Wedding Package**

A wedding package covers the venue and basic wedding costs (ceremony and/or reception). It’s a time and money saver, priced per person or as a total. Packages vary. Some include extras like champagne, decorations, or a DJ. All-inclusive ones handle everything (catering, florist, band, photographer, etc.) and coordinate the day for you.

* **Daily Delegate Rate (DDR)**

A DDR is a budget-friendly option for conferences or meetings. It’s a fixed per-person price for the venue, coffee breaks, sometimes a meal, and basic equipment like a projector or flipchart. Half-day or full-day options make it easy to plan without surprise costs.

# Typical Pricing Types 

* **Meeting rooms typical pricing types:** hire fee per hour, day delegate rate
* **Wedding venues typical pricing types:** package per person, minimum spend, hire fee
* **Party venues typical pricing types:** minimum spend, package per person, hire fee
* **Conference venues typical pricing types:** hire fee, daily delegate rate

The Scaling Blueprint Experienced Buyers Use,"Here’s how I’d break this down if we were sitting across from each other with a coffee and a laptop. You’re already spending around a hundred bucks a day on Meta and you want to push to five thousand without torching your margins. The first thing I’d tell you is that scaling is a game of systems, not hero ads. You need a process that keeps winning creatives flowing, keeps costs predictable, and turns data into leverage.

Start with your creative funnel. At this level creative fatigue is the silent killer. If your ads stop getting attention after a few days you’re not testing enough angles. I like a 3 step pipeline. Step one is pure hook testing with static images or simple text cards. They’re cheap and fast. Any hook that clears a solid click-through benchmark graduates to step two where we layer that hook onto lightweight video or UGC. Step three is full production: polished cuts, testimonials, variations for different audiences. That pipeline means you’re never scrambling for the next idea.

A lot of newer buyers obsess over budgets and ABO versus CBO. The truth is either can work if you respect the data. When I scale I start by letting the algorithm gather enough purchase events to exit the learning phase, then I raise budgets in small but consistent moves about twenty percent at a time if the key metrics stay healthy. I don’t kill more than one or two of my top spenders in a day because sudden drops confuse the system and spike your costs.

Audience overlap worries a lot of people. At higher spends you can’t avoid some overlap, but you can manage it. Keep a clean account structure with clear naming and breakouts for prospecting, warm retargeting, and high-intent repeat buyers. Use Advantage Plus campaigns for broad prospecting once you have strong creative. The more first-party data you feed Meta email lists, past buyers, high-value customer segments the better the machine gets at finding similar people. That’s a huge edge that most small accounts never touch.

Budget testing isn’t about random experiments. It’s about reading the signals. Watch cost per acquisition, frequency, and click-through rate together. If CPA climbs while frequency spikes, you’re fatiguing the audience. Rotate fresh hooks from your creative pipeline and reset learning with new ad IDs. If CTR drops but frequency is stable, the angle just isn’t resonating. Kill it and move on.

Remember, scaling from a hundred a day to five thousand isn’t one big jump. It’s a lot of small compounding moves. Keep your offer sharp, keep your creative pipeline stocked, feed the algorithm clean data, and treat every metric as a feedback loop, not a grade. That’s the real playbook.

[Reddit Discussion],"Every October, Amazon rolls out its **Prime Big Deal Days**, which many shoppers see as a fall version of Prime Day. In 2025, the event is expected to run for two full days (just before the holiday rush). A lot of people are wondering: **will there be more deals added during the event, or is everything front-loaded at launch?**

# How Amazon Usually Handles Prime Big Deal Days

From past years, here’s the typical pattern:

* **Day 1 Launch**: The biggest discounts on top categories (electronics, home, kitchen, beauty) drop immediately.
* **Day 2 Refresh**: New lightning deals and daily deals appear, often replacing expired ones.
* **Surprise Drops**: Certain categories like TVs, laptops, and kitchen appliances tend to get mid-event surprise discounts to keep shoppers coming back.

In 2025, it’s highly likely we’ll see a similar structure. Amazon wants to drive continuous engagement, so they rarely reveal *all* the best deals on day one.

# What Shoppers Can Expect in 2025

* **Electronics & Smart Home**: Expect deeper cuts on laptops, headphones, smartwatches, and TVs as inventory shifts closer to Black Friday.
* **Kitchen & Home Essentials**: Air fryers, coffee makers, vacuums, and heated blankets are expected to get rolling discounts across both days.
* **Gaming & Entertainment**: Consoles, gaming chairs, and accessories often see waves of restocks/deals mid-event.

# Tips for Getting the Best Prime Big Deal Days Offers

1. **Check early, check often** – deals refresh every few hours.
2. **Watch lightning deals** – some of the best discounts sell out in minutes.
3. **Compare with Black Friday leaks** – some items may be cheaper later, but many sell out in October.
4. **Use wishlist & notifications** – this helps track when your items drop in price.

Redditors last year pointed out that some of the *best hidden deals* didn’t show up until the second day. Others noticed that Amazon strategically dropped discounts on slower-moving products late in the event to clear inventory.

So if you’re asking **“will there be more deals on Amazon Prime Big Day Deals in 2025?”**  the short answer is: *yes, but they may not be on the exact product you’re eyeing*. Checking throughout the two-day event is the safest way to avoid missing out.",1,1758796497.0,Laptop_PC_Help,0,1.0,False

The only pleasure I have in life is drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes in the morning and eating.

I don't like playing videogames anymore.

I've done all the things recommended to me, I'm seeing a therapist, try to eat healthy, exercice but I don't see the point.

My friends are trying to help me but I feel so disconnected from them, they have the regular life, I tried to live the same way, stable corporate job and all but it made me even more depressed and I got fired multiple times because of that.

I'm writing coz I feel scared for her.  He's in his 20s and apparently drove her for two or three days from school to home, and she's the type to get close to every random person she sees so naturally she talked to him too. She had his number because he gave it to her and said aavashyamundenki vilicho I'll always come and all. Then in chat he began asking if she'll be there tomorrow, kanan patuvo naale, etc in a weird way. She thought it was just his normal behaviour.

Then soon enough he told her that he saw her in his dream. When asked what the dream was he didn't reply, he said that after the dream he kept looking at her profile photo because she's beautiful and asked her why she can't wear that same saree outside and all(like is he fr bro that's outright creepy). Keep in mind that he's saying this to a literal minor about 10 years younger than him. He kept messaging her and one day even called her at 1 in the morning asking if she watches big boss. Nahh I don't think that's the only thing he wanted to talk about. He asked her if they can meet tomorrow, have a coffee or something, and she said no. She doesn't remember the other stuff he said coz she was sleepy af and had accepted the call because she thought it was some emergency from some other number. Also she thinks he might have a girlfriend or wife coz she saw his phone wallpaper with a woman and when he saw her look at it he immediately kept it down as if he didn't want her to see it. 

Anyway after me and another friend told her to block him and after the random call at night, she did block him. But now I'm really scared about what he might do. He knows her school, her location and her face and name coz he was her driver for some days. That's more than enough personal info to do dangerous stuff, especially considering that she has now blocked him everywhere. She's also worried about whether he might turn up at school one day when they disperse.
