N√£o chega a ser um review t√©cnico.

Recebi meu bomber no final de julho e tenho usado ele praticamente todos os dias, provavelmente numa media de quase duas vezes por dia. 
Tenho usado o V60.

Inicialmente usando filtro hario, estava rondando 2+1...2+2.
Filtro caro (n√£o terminei de usar), ent√£o trouxe um da china pela Ali. menor e mais lento. Fui subindo at√© 2+4.3 mais ou menos.

Hoje estou aquele filtro que n√£o se pode nominar porque esgota r√°pido no local de origem.
√â bom. Mais r√°pido que o da Ali.

No bomber tenho descido gradativamente a regulagem nos √∫ltimos 12 dias talvez. 
Hoje pela manh√£ estava em 1+9.3. E com margem pra descer mais pelo tempo no coador.

Dito isso, acredito que foi preciso amaciar o R3. 
Tamb√©m aumentei a tela que fica no fundo do coletor de caf√© mo√≠do. e gasto ali uns 15s dando uma sacudida/batida. n√£o lembro agora qual o n√∫mero da tela.

Filtro bom faz diferen√ßa. 

E acredito que o paladar tamb√©m v√° se adaptando. Eu sa√≠ daquele cer√¢mico autom√°tico recarreg√°vel da china que vende em todo canto.

Pretendo revezar os filtros agora pra ver o tempo deles.

This one was a fresh transfer of a blast and an early blast after my 3rd ER; I turned 44 a few months ago. Last year we had two ERs in which I could freeze 4 untested blasts. I transferred those earlier this year: all failed except the 2nd FET, which ended in a MMC at 7 weeks.

So really nothing odd, all within our quite known ole statistics, no? The thing is... it's so hard to just let go. IVF is the only way after my partner's cancer treatments before we met, so there was never really ""trying naturally"" for us. The banked sperm seems to be amazing, we always get at least one blast, so our clinic still accepts me as a patient, despite of course making it clear that my best option is DE (which I have considered and ruled out), but yeah, I'm on negative time already... It really kills me to know that he could have good chances to have a child if he just were with someone younger.

We know we'll be fine remaining childless (I mean, I think I know that, just not right now). But we don't rule out having another round, if my clinic agrees (they are rather conservative in treatment, but are open to suggestions). They don't suggested PGT-A and since I don't make that many blasts, I'm ok with that (I know the risks, and I sure don't want to go through another MC or worse, but I want to use every little chance I can get). I never used something like Omnitrope, despite knowing my IGF1 is below the minimum, but again, it may not change much... Same for ovarian PRP, which they don't do themselves.

I tested last Sat too and it was a faint line, most likely still some leftover of the 10000 IU HCG trigger; I will have a other test next weekend by my clinic's request, which is crazily late for me. I can't believe I'll have to spend the whole week taking that horrible estrogen and shoving suppositories up my vagina... Can I have some extra coffee and Camembert cheese at least?? Ugh

Is it ok to start again supplements like CoQ10 or red light right now..? I don't think I'm making a lot of sense, but at least I didn't cry while writing this, lol sorry, if you read this far thanks a lot. Wish you all the best, you are all amazing <3",1,1757325772.0,40Plus_IVF,0,1.0,False

1nbjkm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1nbjkm1/meeting_new_people_friends_perth/,"Meeting new people, friends - Perth","Short story: Is there anyone on here from Perth looking to meet new people of a similar age and with a similar mindset with seeking friendships? I‚Äôm 33M. 

Long story: I had the typical clique upbringing as my friends are all from school - known them since I was 4 years old. So I get the whole cliquey experience many have experienced who are new to Perth or Aus. I‚Äôve been on a journey the past few years to meet new people, broaden the social horizon beyond my clique - as a personal growth thing, but also to meet new people of a similar age as I enter my 30s, as this tends to be the age where friends have less time with starting a family, people get more busy, more picky etc.
I can make connections with older people more easily - but I‚Äôm focused on connecting with people around my age. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm finding the difficulty. And extra difficulty with other guys (but that‚Äôs another post).
I‚Äôm known at my workplace as the friendly guy, approachable, people open up to me, I organise coffee catch ups with various people, I‚Äôm in the social club. And through work I‚Äôve made a few genuine friends who I see outside of the office, but not that regularly. 

Outside of work though, despite joining clubs, classes etc it hasn‚Äôt been that fruitful. I‚Äôve made what I would call ‚Äòfriends‚Äô who can maintain a convo in person but it always falls into me initiating always (which I respect this can happen) as people are busy etc or naturally things die down if the vibe isn‚Äôt there. And I always respect the slow burn approach. Experiences from meeting people through online avenues, like BumbleBFF, Facebook etc I find they tend to attract‚Ä¶ quite strange, insecure or flaky people. I‚Äôve only been to a few Meetups but doesn‚Äôt seem to be many things I‚Äôd be interested in attending and the age range seems to be more older. 

Have tried in the past on the Perth reddit channel, but I got either really friendly comments or dropkick kind of comments, with ultimately no one reaching out and sending a DM. Which is fine, this is Reddit. 

Even people I‚Äôve met who have recently migrated (am generalising here of course), either aren‚Äôt too enthusiastic with keeping in touch or they outright don‚Äôt want to talk to me anymore when I mention that I‚Äôm gay. I‚Äôm not gay with a capital G, for wont of a better phrase, but it still hurts when this mindset comes from people who I thought would be eager to meet all walks of life. 

I‚Äôm after meeting people who are a stage in life, roughly similar age, where they are confident in making conversation and confident in themselves (not cocky), want to head out for activities, can handle different views, can initiate a little bit, are genuinely wanting to meet new people and form friendships and put in some effort even if it means a catch up every few months due to busy schedules etc. I‚Äôm realising more and more that I‚Äôm in the minority, which is odd I think, and I may as well stick to my clique?
I‚Äôm wondering are there people out there who have gone on a similar journey and came to similar observations/conclusions? Bonus if you‚Äôre in Perth.

It might be just tinfoil hat residue speaking in my blood, but is this whole shebang just a really clever way to hire talent? I thought of it (as did lots of us) when I first saw the ""Important Message"" (then it was, ""ah, they're making n ARG, cool') and now I circle back to this idea when the dust has settled. I low key hope that I'm wrong, but the whole design of the event points in that direction.

Why is that? Well, let's start with obvious. CDPR are hiring engineers a lot lately, we all know that, the [https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/jobs](https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/jobs) has a lot of vacancies, I ~~over~~heard that from their HR person during an event. Obvious.

But how do you find the people who are excited by complex tasks, enough to sacrifice their weekends, work well in the team and have that spark, have enough critical thinking to not be mislead by AI nonsense, you know (and that is a kind of culture cultivated in the CDPR, from what it looks like)? That's called top talent in my book (I'm not an HR, but been in IT long enough).

\- But there are loads of candidates on their table, everyone in IT wants to work in CDPR! Loads of engineers are now on the market due to an ongoing AI craze, crypto crash, RTO mandates, budget cuts.. (you name it) Why on Earth would they need to waste effort on something this elaborate?, - you might ask.

But does it really make it easier for them to hire the top talent? In such a huge pool of candidates how do you find the ones with proper culture? How do you head hunt people holding to their chairs when ~~it's like~~ their lives depend on it? You've got an ocean to find a drop. Their hiring department(s) would spend eternity of time (and mounts of cash) trying just to dig through the CVs. Of course, they could use AI for that, but would that work to find culture? You've seen it with redhorn and zwir AI agents (I'm getting back to them later). It would just be AI generated CV going to AI hiring manager who's going to do some AI interviews and at the end of the line you're going to write AI code (and eat AI slop for dinner, ROFL). Or you could send people chasing the wild goose and see how they manage. With that you have gathered a lot of valuable data about your potential candidates. Stuff like:

* Problem solving skills
* Critical thinking
* Leadership skills
* Motivation
* Ability to work in a team
* Persistence
* Analytical thinking
* Ability to pivot
* Willingness to sacrifice weekends and night sleep just because you want to find the solution

¬†This all is right in front of your eyes, you just need to carefully read through a bunch of conspiracy theories (I did a fair share of mine) and see the people for who they (and their internet personas) are. The only downside - your potential candidates might end up solving ARGs during work hours. Or you end up with an actual conspiracy theorist working for you. But if one can be The President, one can be an Engineer, am I right ;)? And the coolest part - they already were incepted with idea that working for you is exciting, so the ones holding their chairs could also budge. All on a measly budget of two Ais for a weekend and a cup of coffee for the one doing the announcement. If you compare that to the cost of hiring a wrong person, HR department crunches, etc - the person (or people) who invented this is genius and I take my (tinfoil) hat off to you. You deserve a promotion and a bonus!

Still hope that I'm wrong and there is more ARG after that (or I could trade for a new DLC, lol) but until the first golden tickets to Netwatch party start showing up - my money is on this one.

1nbjgr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianwriters/comments/1nbjgr2/the_goodbye_i_never_heard_chapter_1/,The goodbye i never heard chapter 1,"# this i first chapter of my work can you please take time and rate it, you can tell if it is really bab, good,average anything you can also suggest changes . looking forward to your feedback



# Chapter 1: And it begins

# I hadn‚Äôt opened a real letter in years. So when I saw my name on this one, I did something stupid‚ÄîI hoped.

# Maybe it was from a sports trial I barely remembered attending.

# Or maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚ÄîI was someone‚Äôs secret crush, and this was a love letter.

# Or a Cheque.

# Whatever it was, all those happy thoughts vanished the moment I opened it.

# ‚ÄúAs of date, your attendance for the academic session 2014‚Äì15 is recorded as 0%. According to university regulations, a minimum of 50% attendance is mandatory to appear in the semester examinations. Failure to fulfil this condition will make you ineligible to sit for the exams.‚Äù

# That should‚Äôve been enough.

# But they didn‚Äôt stop there.

# They sent a copy to my father too‚Äîby email, just to make sure the humiliation was digitally permanent.

# For a second, I hoped maybe he wouldn‚Äôt read it. That maybe, just this once, he‚Äôd miss it.

# He didn‚Äôt.

# ¬†

# That evening, his call came. No yelling. No drama. Just five calm words:

# ‚ÄúDo one thing‚Äîcome back home.‚Äú

# Then came the add-on:

# ‚ÄúStart going to college seriously... or learn how business works at your uncle‚Äôs shop.‚Äú

# I knew he wanted me to focus on college‚Äîbut this was his way of issuing a quiet, calculated threat. The kind that doesn‚Äôt raise its voice, but still hits hard.

# And me? I had been in Bhopal for over three months... and still didn‚Äôt know where my college was.

# MP Nagar? I could navigate it blindfolded. 10 Number Market? I could walk through it with my eyes closed. But my college? I hadn‚Äôt even seen the building since the day of admission‚Äîand that too, with my elder brother.

# Something had to change.

# That night, I went to bed early. No drinks. No late-night rambling. No mindless banter.

# The next morning, I wore a white shirt, light blue jeans, a black jacket‚Äîand sunglasses I didn‚Äôt need but wore anyway. Honestly, I looked more like a confused tourist than a first-year engineering student.

# I tried to get ready on time but still ran a little late. By the time I reached the bus stop, the college bus had already left. I took my bike, hoping to reach faster‚Äî but ended up stuck in traffic.

# Somehow, I finally reached the college gate around 10 a.m.

# A statue of Goddess Sarasvati stood tall at the entrance. Something about her presence felt divine‚Äî as if she silently welcomed and blessed everyone who passed by.

# The security guard, however, was the complete opposite. Unwelcoming and cold, he asked for my college ID with a dash of arrogance.

# I gave him a confused look and mumbled a vague explanation. Somehow‚ÄîGod knows how‚ÄîI still got in.

# The campus looked peaceful. Too peaceful. Pathways clean. Courts empty. A group of students stood under the sun, working intently with theodolites. Everyone looked like they knew exactly what they were doing.

# The academic block was at the far end of the campus, past the auditoriums and sports courts that lined the middle.

# The receptionist directed me to the first-year Mechanical class. Ground floor. Last room on the left.

# The professor was mid-lecture. Everyone in the room wore a uniform‚Äîblue shirts and navy trousers. Not a single girl in sight, which, honestly, I had already predicted.

# I stood at the door and cleared my throat. ‚ÄúSir... first-year Mechanical?‚Äú

# He looked me up and down.

# ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äú

# ‚ÄúReyansh Thakur, sir. First day.‚Äú

# Before he could scold me for showing up months late and out of uniform, I quickly added,

# ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt aware of the dress code, sir. I‚Äôll follow it from tomorrow.‚Äú

# He exhaled and pointed. ‚ÄúGo meet your HOD first.‚Äú

# Meeting Mr. Ajay Kaviti felt like stepping into court where the verdict was already written.

# He didn‚Äôt ask much. Just told me to sit outside.

# After fifteen minutes, he called me in, handed me a blank paper, and said,

# ‚ÄúWrite an acceptable reason for not attending till date.‚Äú

# I stared at the sheet. He stared at me.

# ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you writing?‚Äú he asked.

# ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a pen,‚Äú I muttered.

# He handed me his. No sarcasm. No smile. Just quiet disappointment.

# I began:

# ‚ÄúThe reason for my short attendance is...‚Äú

# Blank.

# What was I supposed to write?

# If I lied about being sick, he‚Äôd ask for medical documents. If I said it was an accident‚Äîwell, I had no injuries to show.

# Then it hit me.

# ‚ÄúHairline fracture in my right hand while playing.‚Äú

# My sports club guy could easily back it up with a fake report. I added some emotional seasoning‚Äîrecovery time, guilt, regret.

# I ended with the classic:

# ‚ÄúSorry for the inconvenience, sir.‚Äú

# He chuckled.

# ‚ÄúThis is the problem with your whole generation‚Äîtoo much sorry, too little sincerity.‚Äú

# Then he looked up.

# ‚ÄúFracture in your right hand?‚Äú

# ‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äú

# ‚ÄúEven with a fractured hand, your legs worked. Your brain worked. The college bus is free. You didn‚Äôt come because you didn‚Äôt want to.‚Äú

# I nodded.

# ‚ÄúI hope you learn the value of education... before life makes you,‚Äú he said calmly.

# And just as I was about to leave, he added:

# ‚ÄúAnd wear a uniform from tomorrow. You look like a joker.‚Äú

# Back in class, I somehow made it through the next three lectures. Then came the BME lecture.

# Somewhere between Bernoulli‚Äôs Theorem and Boolean Logic, I lost the battle‚Äî my head dropped to the desk, and I drifted off. I had no idea how long I slept.

# But I woke up to a hand on my back.

# ‚ÄúWake up,‚Äú the professor said.

# No yelling. No scolding.

# Just two words:

# ‚ÄúWalk out.‚Äú

# So I did.

# Oddly enough, it felt lighter outside‚Äîlike stepping out of a stuffy room you didn‚Äôt realize was suffocating you.

# I headed to the canteen, grabbed a coffee, and casually asked the guy at the counter where people usually go to smoke. He pointed behind the building.

# I walked over. The place was empty. Just one guy‚Äîsmoking and talking on the phone like the rest of the world didn‚Äôt even exist.

# I gave him a small nod‚Äîthe kind that says hello without expecting a reply. To my surprise, he nodded back and asked,

# ‚ÄúWhich branch?‚Äú

# When I told him I was from Mechanical, he looked mildly surprised‚Äî he was from the same branch too.

# But the real surprise came when I told him my name.

# ‚ÄúReyansh,‚Äú I said.

# He blinked, then smiled.

# ‚ÄúNo way. My name‚Äôs Reyansh too. Haven‚Äôt seen you around.‚Äú

# ‚ÄúMissed the first few months. Injury,‚Äú I replied.

# The more we talked, the more I realized‚Äî he was like a better version of me in almost everything: studies, sports, and especially in interacting with people and making friends.

# His full name was Reyansh Patel. He introduced me to a few other guys from the classroom‚ÄîDhruv, Vikram, Aayush, and a couple more.

# Most of them joked about me getting thrown out on my first day, but I didn‚Äôt mind. After the kind of day I‚Äôd had, even that felt like a form of acceptance.

# And just like that, what started as a horrific, humiliating mess of a day ended with a bit of relief.

1nbjfvl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nbjfvl,"Friend's first cycling trip and my first wild camp, from Nemours to Orl√©ans, France","Last weekend was the last couple of rain-free days we would get before cold, dark autumn would creep in on our neck of the woods, so my friend and I set off on a little cycling adventure. Friend rides his bike everyday but had never really cycled for leisure/tourism, while I had never wild camped (always paid for designated campgrounds), so this was a first for us both.

The route : 124km from Nemours (1h train ride from Paris) to Montargis (pic 2) then finished at Orl√©ans with its stunning cathedral and swimming spots along the Loire river.
It's a canal cycle path, some asphalt, some fine gravel, nothing too rough as we ride what we have (70s/80s road frames, panniers, 25mm tyres). Flat all the way, great weather, not breathtaking views but some wildlife sightings (lots of wading birds), perfect conditions to give my friend the cycle touring bug!

We made a couple detours for points of interest, ate tons of bread, cheese and snacks, slept off the road next to a forest, drank camp stove instant coffee while the sun dried the dew off our tent, and arrived in Orl√©ans just in time for lunch on Sunday. Train ride back to Paris with the bikes.

Those weekend trips are good because they scratch the itch but leave you wanting more. We kept talking about the longer routes we wanted to ride.",1,1757324947.0,bicycletouring,0,1.0,False
1nbjfsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ThrowAwayThoughts72/comments/1nbjfsr/im_thinking_of_leaving_my_partner_i_need_to_vent/,I'm thinking of leaving my partner. (I need to vent),"Firstly, few things to say before I go on my long-winded vent:

1) Advice/thoughts/questions/etc are accepted and appreciated. But Im really just needing to get this stuff of my chest, with or without outsider input.

2) I will be strictly using the term ""partner"" to try and prevent any biases. Idk if that seems silly but I want people to be genuine about their thoughts on this.

3) We are both 24 years old, only about a month apart in age. We have been dating for over 2.5 years and living together for over a year. We are not engaged or married (thank god, lowkey). We both work full time and spilt rent and bills 50/50.

4) MP = my partner

Okay. Previous to my partner and I moving in together, I was genuinely happy in my relationship. But now, I hold a lot of resentment and anger. It wasnt my plan of course to be this way but the little things seem to pile higher and higher everyday. My main issue is house chores. There is a lot I could say in regards to house chores but Ill keep it brief: I do the sweeping, mopping, litterbox cleaning, ensuring our cat and turtle have food and water, clearing the table of trash and dishes, cleaning up our cat's hairballs/vomit (he's a long-haired cat), everything. All of it. All the chores you can think of, ***I DO****.* The only thing I truly try to avoid is dishes. I hate hate ***hate*** doing the dishes and I told MP when we first moved in that I was fully willing to do the rest of the chores as long as they do the dishes. But unfortunately, only one of us are holding up our end of the deal. Although this has been weighing on me more and more each day, it's the events from this past week that have pushed me more than before. 

Firstly, lets start with the smaller, less significant issue. It small but its still an issue that isnt sitting right with me. I know that in words, it might seem silly, but coming from my shoes? It hits a little different. Saturday night (sept. 6), MP and I are watching a couple of movies. We eat popcorn, snacks, drink soda, and enjoy ourselves. MP is sitting in the recliner, and Im on the couch. Well, at some point, MP makes a cup of chocolate milk. No biggie. They dont finish the drink and instead of placing it on the perfectly good coffee table one foot to their left, they set it on the ground to their right. Okay, whatever. We finish our movies and go to bed. 

Come the following morning (sunday, the day that I started writing this lol), MP goes into work before I do so when I wake up, Im home alone. I go into the living room to find that the cup of chocolate milk has spilled and has made little rivers on the floor (we have very uneven flooring). The thing is, the cup is in the upright position which tells me that '*someone*' knew about the spill, put the cup back upright, and then left the mess. Fine. I decide that Im going to leave it and just see what happens when I come home from work. Fast forward, I get off work at 11pm, I skip the gym and come home to find, not rivers, but sticky residue in their spot. I ask MP about it and they said, ""well I cleaned it with that cleaner right there"" \*points to cleaner thats sitting on the recliner\*. I say, ""okay well, its still sticky?"" Their reply, ""It must not be a very good cleaner."" We move on. -Blah blah blah unimportant stuff here- MP goes to bed. I started thinking about it and wondered what exactly did MP clean the mess with.....when we are out of paper towels????? I used the last little bit sunday morning while cleaning a different mess so what did MP use?????? We also dont have any rags in the house and there are no towels in our dirty pile. 

I decide to run out to my car and grab some napkins. I spray the cleaner on a small section of the residue, wipe it..and what do ya know, it gets rid of the sticky residue. So now, it got me sitting here questioning, did they lie about cleaning it? Or did they lowkey just spray the cleaner on the milk and leave it there thinking that would fix it?????? And if they are lying about it, why? Why lie about it? Anyway, it's not sitting right with me and I think Im going to leave some napkins on the table and, again, see what happens.

Anyway, lets move onto the real juicy stuff: 

On Monday (sept.1) our landlord texted MP asking if we needed our air filters changed, and that she would come Wednesday if so. I told MP to tell the landlord 'no' because I have been working so much that I dont have the time to clean the house to the standard I want. I typically work from 2pm to 11pm with maybe one day off every 5-6 days. On Tuesday, I go to work, we both hit the gym for about 45min, and then we both go home. I realize the house is still messy and it reminds me about our landlord, so I ask MP if they had texted the landlord back; they did not. Mind you, it is midnight as this point, our landlord likes to come early in the morning, MP had been off ALL day, and we both work the following day. MP says they'll just text our landlord back now and, come to find out, the landlord has edited the text from a question to a statement, ""We are changing air filters Wednesday."" Point, blank, period. The landlord is coming in the morning. 

Im pissed. I immediately drop my stuff and start cleaning. Sweeping, mopping, wiping down surfaces, moving items to their homes, etc etc etc. What does MP do????? Play on their phone for 30 min. I get even MORE pissed and say, ""hey if youre not going to do anything, can you start the dishes?"" Their reply, ""no because I was just about to fix the toilet."" Whats wrong with the toilet you might ask? Well, it had been dripping for the last 48 hours and all MP had to do was tighten two bolts.....again, may I remind you that MP had been off work ALL day. But yes, lets choose right now to fix the toilet. Anyway, once they get that done, they start the dishes (yippee). They get *maybe* a quarter of the way through when they come out into the living room and say, ""I think Im just going to do this in the morning."" .....can you feel my rage yet? 

Im already pissed at this point so it takes everything in me to stay calm. I ask them ""are you *actually* going to do it in the morning? Are you *actually* going to get up early enough to do the dishes before the landlord comes?"" I, of course, get no reply because we both already know the answer. We both pause what we're doing to eat but once I get done, guess what Im doing? Cleaning. When MP gets done, guess what they do....thats right, they are back on their phone for probably another 20-30 min. They finally get back up, do a few more dishes, come back into the living room and say, ""are you ready to take a shower? I really want to take a shower."" Its probably 2:30 at this point (Im just guestimating because I didnt check the clock once except at the moment when I got done). I tell them no because Im still cleaning and I would like to get this done now. They take a shower, lay in bed and eventually go to sleep. I continue cleaning. I finally get done at 3:30am, take my shower, and am finally in bed by 3:45am. No thanks to my partner. :/

Im not usually the kind to let people in on my relationship issues but I have been so frustrated that I vented to a few of my closer coworkers. And they told me that I should talk to MP about it. But honestly....I have a feeling that it will be waste of energy. I have a feeling that MP will either be 100% defensive mode and say something like, ""well im just so tired recently and blah blah blah."" OR they will ""fix"" the issue for a few days and \*boom\* be right back at it. I finally have a day off so I think I will try to have a chat with MP but I really do think that this might be *it*. 

Also, the reason I have yet to move out and/or leave is because I simply cant afford it rn. I am saving up money for life in general but I can really only save maybe $300 at the end of every month, if im lucky. And at this moment, I only have like $500 in my savings. So even if I wanted to and was 1000% ready, I wouldnt be able to.",1,1757324939.0,u_ThrowAwayThoughts72,0,1.0,False

That‚Äôs Why It‚Äôs a Masterstroke.,"I just read this piece about India's first chip, the 'Vikram' processor, and it's got me thinking‚Äîlike, really thinking‚Äîabout what progress even means. You see the pictures from September 2025, right? PM Modi is holding up that tiny thing.

And part of me swells up, honestly, like yeah, we did it! But then this other voice in my head‚Äîthe one that remembers all the false starts, the missed chances from like the 80s‚Äîit goes quiet. Skeptical, you know? Is this it?

So the specs. They built it on 180nm tech. Let‚Äôs be real, that‚Äôs ancient. My phone‚Äîthis thing I‚Äôm typing on right now‚Äîit‚Äôs probably running something a fraction of that. 3nm, 5nm‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs another world.

It‚Äôs like comparing a bicycle to a hyperloop. And yet‚Äîand this is the weird part‚ÄîI don‚Äôt even care? Or I do, but not in the way I thought I would. Because sometimes old is gold. Reliable. It‚Äôs like my grandpa‚Äôs watch; it‚Äôs not smart, but it never stops.

And that‚Äôs the thing people miss. This chip wasn‚Äôt meant for your next iPhone. It‚Äôs for space. For defense.

Stuff where failure isn‚Äôt an option. Where you need something rugged, trusted, homegrown. It‚Äôs not glamorous, but it‚Äôs sturdy. And honestly?

The global market for these ‚Äúmature‚Äù chips is huge‚Äîlike, most of the pie. Cars, appliances, all that. It‚Äôs smart. A backdoor into relevance.

But then‚Äîugh, my coffee‚Äôs gone cold‚Äîthere‚Äôs the other side. We‚Äôre so far behind. The gap feels‚Ä¶ emotional, almost.

Like running a marathon where everyone else is on scooters. I want to feel proud, and I do, but it‚Äôs a fragile pride. One bad headline away from crumbling.

I remember when I first read about the India Semiconductor Mission‚Äîthe sheer scale of the money‚ÄîI got chills. But money doesn‚Äôt always fix everything. Does it?

Also, can we talk about the smell of a lab? That clean, almost sterile scent‚ÄîI caught a whiff of something like it once on a tour at IISc Bangalore, and it stuck with me. Metallic but calm. It‚Äôs where the magic happens. Or, you know, the grinding hard work.

What‚Äôs next? The Tatas are building fabs in Dholera‚Äîlike, actual factories. Not just a one-off chip. That‚Äôs the real test. Can we make them efficient? Cheap? Good? It‚Äôs one thing to make a few chips for rockets; it‚Äôs another to flood the market.

To compete. And with the world kinda fracturing‚ÄîUS-China tensions, everyone wants a safe supply chain‚ÄîIndia could be that safe bet. But potential‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs such a fragile word. It‚Äôs like saying someone has a nice personality.

I don‚Äôt know. Part of me is wildly optimistic‚Äîit‚Äôs happening!‚Äîand part of me is braced for disappointment. We‚Äôve been here before. But this time‚Ä¶ it feels closer. Even if it‚Äôs a 180nm chip in a 3nm world.

So what do you think‚Äîis this the start of something real, or are we just fooling ourselves again?",1,1757324931.0,u_imsurajkumar,0,1.0,False

1nbjakv,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1nbjakv/pourover_variables/,Pourover Variables,"I saw a post earlier where someone listed out variables that they considered important and ones they thought irrelevant in V60 brewing. I disagree with some of the opinions stated there and thought I'd put out a more ""scientific"" set of recommendations to consider in pourover brewing that might especially benefit someone new to the hobby and looking for a primer.

I want to note that I'm not aiming to minimise the experiences of the person that made the post I referenced earlier. On the contrary, I think it's great that they analysed their brews and came up with guidelines that work for them.

Anyway, I think it's quite important to get something out of the way before we talk variables, and that is the **quality of your coffee and water**. You can get everything else right and you could be the best brewer in the world, but none of those tend to matter a whole bunch unless they are accompanied by good coffee and good water. I think a lot of people appreciate the importance of good quality coffee but often disregard the water. There is the notion that water makes up about 98% of a cup of filter coffee, and that is something to keep in mind, but more importantly, **water is the solvent** that dissolves substances present in your **ground coffee (the solute)** in a process called **extraction**. Changing the composition of your solvent will affect the nature of this extraction.

I'm hardly asking you to go out and get demineralised water so that you can make your own brew water. Definitely don't if you're happy with your coffee as is. Consideration to the structure of your brew water, however, is perhaps worthwhile if it's something you've not paid attention to thus far and think your coffee could use a little improvement. If you're looking to read more about recommendations for optimal brew water for filter coffee, this is a great resource: [**https://coffeeadastra.com/2018/12/16/water-for-coffee-extraction/**](https://coffeeadastra.com/2018/12/16/water-for-coffee-extraction/)

Let's move on to brew parameters. If any of these confuse you or seem different from your own experiences, I recommend comparing extreme examples for each given scenario. For instance, compare a brew ratio (coffee:water) of 1:10 to a ratio of 1:18 to understand the impact of changing the brew ratio on cup profile or evaluate 2 cups of coffee, one with a single pour and the other with multiple, say 5.

* **Dose:** This might not seem very intuitive, but dose plays a big role on your cup of coffee, even if you maintain your brew ratio as you scale up or down. If you keep grind size unchanged, changing your dose will affect the available surface area for extraction, the height of the brew bed which in turn affects contact time, and the amount of water used for extraction. To offset some of these effects, I recommend grinding coarser if you dose deeper and grinding finer if you dose lower.
* **Grind Size:** This is perhaps the most obvious parameter for most people and for good reason, since it affects the surface area available for extraction, contact time and body as a result, extraction percentage and therefore your overall flavour profile. If you're pretty happy with your cup already and think all it could use is a minor tweak, I suggest not changing the grind size.
* **Brew Ratio:** Since water is the solvent in our extraction process, using more water will increase the amount of extraction and simultaneously reduce the intensity of our final cup since it's more diluted (or lower in TDS). I suggest lengthening your brew ratio if your coffee has an abrupt finish as you sip it and/or tastes too intense for your liking, and shortening the ratio if you observe a bitter/unpleasant aftertaste and/or lacks intensity of flavour.
* **Number of Pours:** The number of pours have a direct correlation to the extraction percentage of your coffee.
* **Water Temperature:** Much like the number of pours it has a directly proportional relationship to extraction percentage, but the effect is not as intense.

People often talk about **contact time** and while I do pay attention to it, I view it as an outcome of the brewing process and not as a variable I can control.

If you have different views on these or have something in mind that is not mentioned here, I'd love to hear about it.",1,1757324401.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

1nbj7zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1nbj7zo/explore_whether_fuller_724_upholstery_cleaner/,Explore Whether Fuller 724 Upholstery Cleaner Truly Restores Fabric,"The Fuller Brush 724 Upholstery Cleaner caught my eye while searching for a solution to restore my stained sofa and other fabric surfaces. I‚Äôve tested it extensively, and while there‚Äôs a lot to appreciate, a few quirks stood out during my daily use. This cleaner is designed for carpets, rugs, and upholstery, claiming to lift stubborn stains and eliminate odor without requiring a rinse. Naturally, I had to put these bold promises to the test. 

**Performance on Stains and Grime**  
Using this product on my favorite couch, which had acquired a mix of coffee spills and general wear, was a bit of a surprising experience. The foam formula clings well to surfaces, and after spraying directly onto the stains, the results were visible within seconds. It effectively broke down the grime without over-wetting the fabric, something liquid-based cleaners tend to struggle with. However, tougher stains needed some extra attention, even with the suggested use of a stain brush for agitation. Despite that, it left my couch looking significantly fresher.

**Ease of Use**  
The application couldn‚Äôt be simpler: spray, let it sit briefly, blot, and you‚Äôre done. Its no-rinse claim held true in my testing, and the process was quick and user-friendly. One thing worth noting is that for heavily soiled areas, you might need to repeat the process, and blotting thoroughly is key to avoiding damp spots. Even my 10-year-old managed to clean a carpet spill with minimal supervision, which earns a huge thumbs-up for convenience.

[Check Fuller Brush 724 Upholstery Cleaner price on Amazon.](https://app.womanreview.com/p/b00n37snfg/)

**Suitable Surfaces**  
What impressed me most is the multi-surface compatibility. I‚Äôve tried this cleaner on cotton curtains, velour chairs, and even the fabric upholstery in my car. It didn‚Äôt disappoint, delivering versatility that extends well beyond just household furniture. It‚Äôs equally effective on nylon carpets and rayon materials, which is great if you‚Äôre dealing with a variety of textiles at home or on the go.

**Highlights**  
‚Ä¢ Stain removal is thorough, especially with light to moderate spills.  
‚Ä¢ Foam formula ensures the surface doesn‚Äôt get too wet.  
‚Ä¢ Can be used on diverse materials like carpets, velour, and rayon.  
‚Ä¢ Extremely easy to use for even non-cleaning pros.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
While the product performs admirably, it‚Äôs not flawless. A couple of downsides became evident during regular use:  
‚Ä¢ Stubborn, deeply embedded stains may require multiple applications.  
‚Ä¢ The foam can stick to your fingers if you‚Äôre not careful, which might be annoying during cleanup.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing this cleaner to its market rivals like Resolve or Bissell‚Äôs SpotClean products, a few differences stand out. While Fuller Brush‚Äôs foam formula is excellent for surface cleaning with no sticky residue, the competitors often excel in tackling deeply ingrained dirt due to built-in scrubbing features or steam-clean capabilities. However, Resolve, for instance, doesn‚Äôt do as well with odor elimination versus this upholstery cleaner. If quick, fuss-free cleaning is a priority, the Fuller Brush offers a unique formula that outshines some competitors in terms of convenience and ease.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering its promised features like odor removal, multi-fabric compatibility, and ease of use, this cleaner is a fair contender in the mid-range market. It‚Äôs cost-effective for those looking for a basic yet efficient cleaner. However, for deep-cleaning enthusiasts or professional-grade results, investing in a stronger steam or liquid cleaner might yield better outcomes. Still, the balance of quality and efficiency makes this upholstery cleaner a practical choice for everyday messes.

The road takes you through Elbasan, so plan a short stop in the city. If you leave early, start your day with a warm bugace from one of the local bakeries, a traditional treat that can only be found in Elbasan. It‚Äôs a flaky, savory pastry filled with a juicy dough pie and it‚Äôs taste that you have never tried before. Locals grab it with a glass of dhall√´ or a small coffee. After breakfast, take a short walk around the Elbasan Castle or grab supplies before heading up toward Funar√´.

The drive from Elbasan to the trailhead adds another 30 to 40 minutes, with views getting better as you climb higher. You‚Äôll drive through winding mountain roads, with pine trees lining each turn. Make sure your tank is full and bring some snacks. Once you get there, park near the village center and begin your walk on foot. You won‚Äôt need a guide. The trails are clear, and locals will gladly point the way if you ask.

The highlight of Funar√´ is its chain of small glacial lakes. If you‚Äôre into photography, go early. Morning light hits the water just right. Bring sturdy shoes. The trails can get rocky and steep in short stretches. You‚Äôll pass goats, small wooden huts, and water springs. No cafes here. You‚Äôll want to pack your lunch.

After lunch, take one of the side trails into the forest. These paths lead you deeper into Funar√´‚Äôs old woods. Look out for traditional stone walls and ruins from shepherd huts. You‚Äôll hear birds more than people. If you‚Äôre into silence, this is the place. No traffic. No buzzing. Just wind and pine.

For those who are into fishing, the lakes in Funar√´ have great waters with two of the tastiest fish of the area which are ‚Äúkrap‚Äù and ‚Äúballgjer‚Äù. The lake used to be left behind, and these species were in danger of extinction, however the locals have taken care of the lakes and they are flourishing with fish. Take your fishing equipment, a grill, some woods and coil, and have a nice lunch with the fresh fish you caught if you‚Äô re into camping adventures!

After doing a lot of research I got myself an Ascaso Steel DUO PID four months ago and was satisfied with its performance, both in terms of coffee extraction and steaming. About 3-4 weeks ago, I suddenly started having problems with the steam unit (hardly any water drops came out and there was no steam at all). I then descaled and cleaned it thoroughly. During the cleaning program, water was flushed through with a lot of pressure, which is why I think clogging is unlikely. I didn't see any immediate improvement and was about to send the machine in for repair.

But shortly after, I tried running the steam with water a few times, everything suddenly worked perfectly again. That lasted for about 1 week and I could make great cappuccino with smooth, silky milk.

Now the problem has reappeared. I started the machine as normal, let it heat up briefly, blew through the steam unit once, made an espresso, and when I wanted to froth milk, there was hardly any steam output again. After I exited the mode, a very small amount of steam was blown out, which is not normally the case (see video). I waited and tried again after a few minutes. Then there was no steam at all, just a little water.

I'm not technically savvy and wonder what could have happened after 4 months with a maximum of 3 coffees per day. Whether it's a technical defect in the machine or am I'm asking too much of the thermoblock (and should have opted for a dual boiler in the first place, as I only drink coffee drinks with milk). Every day it's a bit of a gamble whether it will work or not, which is very frustrating.

Any advice is much appreciated!

1nbj1dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1nbj1dm/just_wanted_to_share_something_i_discovered_by/,"Just wanted to share something I discovered by accident that ""cured"" my IBS","I have always had GI issues, my whole life.  I'm now in my late 50s.  I was born to a mother who was only 17, and this was in the 60's, when they didn't understand proper breastfeeding schedules.  Newborns can need to be fed up to every two hours, because breast milk is very easily digestible, and it doesn't stick around long.  Well, my grandmother believed that my mother was supposed to feed me every four hours. So when I would scream in between these long breaks from feeding, they decided that the breast milk obviously wasn't enough for me, so I should be started on food extra early.  They began to give me baby cereal, and ruined my gut.  I developed chronic constipation as an infant.  It was pretty bad.  After that, I don't think i've ever had a normal gut.  I'm also type O blood, and we are more prone to stomach issues.

Fast forward, after many years of different types of extreme gut issues, and I have developed a lot of problems because of being on transplant medicine for the past 15 years.  I will get random bouts of loose stool and diarrhea that just make me miserable and make a mess of everything.  I have a wide range of things that I would do to try to clean myself, and also keep the mess off my clothing, when it would ""present itself unexpectedly"".  The gassiness also made me feel like I would definitely be single the rest of my life.

Then I discovered the wonders of Psyllium capsules, from Costco.  People take this fiber supplement for a variety of reasons.   One of the things it does really well is work as an absorber in the gut.  For this reason, if you are on any serious medications for medical issues, consult with your doctor.  You would need to take something like this hours apart from taking medications, and also be sure it's not going to cause too much of a change in your levels.   This is what I discovered, and so I only take six or seven of these pills once a day, halfway between my transplant medication doses.  I also have my doctor keeping track of my medicine levels, to make sure it's working out. 

The reason I started taking it, is because my brother had wonderful results in reducing his cholesterol this way. I have very high cholesterol, which is triggered by the transplant medicine.  It's not the most effective technique for me, because I can't take it four times a day, which makes iy more effective for that purpose.

But one thing it has done for me, is stopped the unpredictable and sometimes debilitating IBS symptoms.  (If you have chronic constipation, I don't recommend taking Psyllium). I personally love it, because it slows everything down, and absorbs all that extra fluid or whatever it is that my gut is irritated by, that causes issues.  Yes, I sometimes poop what looks like a pile of small ""rocks"", but it's not necessarily uncomfortable.  I believe that eating regularly, drinking plenty of liquids, and getting some exercise makes a big difference in this.  People who drink coffee also have an advantage, because it will definitely stimulate the plumbing. 

I just thought I'd share with others who suffer, as it might be something to investigate or experiment with, allowing that taking it fits in with your medical issues.  I definitely appreciate the difference it has made.

1. rejection. while i tried to lie to myself about this, i am scared of rejection. this is the first girl i‚Äôve really thought about and liked since i left school, and having her reject me is something that would hurt a bit. 

2. awkwardness the next time i go in there. i know the owner on a personal level and i‚Äôm always in there. i haven‚Äôt been going as regularly lately but i‚Äôve been going back. the girl has worked there for as long as i can remember but never really saw her like that. 

3. what if it works out. i do have a plan to take her to a new bowling alley that opened near me but what if it she says yes to me. i‚Äôm scared that i‚Äôd be wasting my time, money and effort with a girl who really wouldn‚Äôt be interested in dating. or what if she has a boyfriend.

4. my relationship experience. while i personally would consider myself a good looking guy, i wasn‚Äôt always like that. i had quite an ‚Äòugly phase‚Äô during my late teens and early 20s. during that time i haven‚Äôt ever had a proper girlfriend, i‚Äôve never done the deed or even kissed someone. i was literally just existing. while i‚Äôm alot better with small talk now, my inexperience with girls really comes out sometimes when things get spicy. what if she‚Äôs had experience with guys and then comes out with me, someone who‚Äôs never been on a date before and what she would think. this confident guy turns into a complete loser on a date who can‚Äôt hold a conversation or energy for a few hours

1nbizeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1nbizeh/should_you_buy_the_tipgo_glass_detergent/,Should You Buy the TIPGO Glass Detergent Dispenser for Laundry?,"The TIPGO LD-PLASTIC glass laundry detergent dispenser has been a game changer in my home. I took my time testing every feature to see if it was a worthy investment, and let me tell you, there‚Äôs a lot to unpack here. From its sleek design to practical functionality, this product offers several noteworthy aspects but also has a few quirks.

**Aesthetic and Durable Design**  
The minimalist design was an instant hit in my laundry room. Its black finish and sturdy glass material make it an elegant addition to any space. The dispenser features a durable BPA-free glass container, which feels thick and reliable. Even with its 3.5-liter capacity, the jar remains manageable to handle. However, it‚Äôs not all perfect since the plastic lid feels a bit cheap and less robust compared to the premium glass body. While cleaning it isn‚Äôt a significant hassle, some might find the lid slightly tedious to maintain.

**User-Friendly Features**  
One of my favorite aspects of this dispenser is the oversized 6.3-inch wide mouth. Refilling detergent is ridiculously simple, and you won‚Äôt have to deal with spills ‚Äì trust me, I‚Äôve tested it with everything from liquid soap to fabric softener. The size isn‚Äôt just practical for pouring in liquids but also for cleaning the inside thoroughly, something a lot of other options make unnecessarily frustrating.

**304 Stainless Steel Spigot**  
The highlight for me was the spigot. Made from 304 stainless steel, it has proven to be both durable and corrosion-resistant. It dispenses liquid smoothly without clogging or dripping, which is a lifesaver during my sometimes chaotic laundry routines. Its versatility surprised me as I tested it with not just detergent but also juice to see how it performed‚Äîit didn‚Äôt disappoint! The nozzle remained leak-free and effective after multiple trials.

**Perks**  
- The 128 oz capacity eliminates the need for frequent refills, saving time during busy weeks.  
- Comes with waterproof minimalist-style labels that enhance the clean and tidy look of any laundry room.  
- The versatile spigot isn‚Äôt just designed for detergents but also works for other liquids like coffee or juice, adding multi-functional use.  

[Want TIPGO LD-PLASTIC? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b0d9wjnbmm/)

**Disadvantages**  
While the TIPGO detergent dispenser checks many boxes, some areas still leave room for improvement.  
- **Lid Durability:** The plastic lid feels notably flimsy compared to the rest of the build.  
- **Dishwasher Limitations:** Not being dishwasher safe makes cleaning slightly inconvenient for some users.  
- **Weight When Full:** Although manageable when empty, it becomes significantly heavy when filled to capacity, which may be challenging for some to lift or move.  

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing the TIPGO dispenser to competitors, such as glass containers from other brands, reveals its clear strengths and a few relative weak points. Similar designs often lack the durable spigot that this one offers. However, options like Farmhouse Glass Dispensers sometimes pair aesthetic appeal with toughened lids, giving them a slight edge. While others skimp on capacity or use inferior materials for the container, TIPGO‚Äôs large capacity and premium glass significantly outshine those alternatives. That said, if dishwasher-safe materials are a priority, you might find better options elsewhere.

**Bang for the Buck**  
This product feels worth its value because of its multifunctionality and design. It does exactly what you purchase it for, and the craftsmanship of the glass body combined with its 304 stainless steel spigot stands out in its price category. I honestly feel you‚Äôd have to spend considerably more to match its features in another product. Yes, the plastic lid isn‚Äôt its strongest aspect, but that minor flaw doesn‚Äôt outweigh all the positives.

1nbiyiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nbiyiv/espresso_machine_for_the_wife_400800/,Espresso machine for the wife [400-800$],"Hi all

Let me preface this by saying this, i do not drink coffee except from forcing some down dmwhile studying many years ago, i dont plan on starting anytime soon, its just not for me.

But my wife does not function without it, so im planning to surprise her with a fancy (relatively) coffee machine.

She is in no way a coffee snob, she mostly drinks pre-ground coffee from a national brand bought at the grocery store, which she brews in a moccamaster. We also had a nespresso machine that she used when she wanted an espresso, it was a delonghi machine with a steamer (EN520), but it has recently lost pretty much all water pressure and just sputters and creates watered out coffee, even after several tried to descale and clean. I tried taking it apart and theres no scale buildup, so im guessing it just had a part failure somewhere, so we are retiring it.



Anyways, to the point:
Im interested in buying a nicer espresso machine for my wife, she has voiced interest in getting a machine with a grinder so she can shop around for fancy coffee and find her preference. 

It needs to be a machine that has a low entry skill level (easy to learn) but also be able to offer enough configurability to keep up with her as she learns to use it and gets more advanced in her preferences.

She also has a thing for avoiding microplastics and chemicals, so any machine that is full/mostly metal and no plastics in contact with the hot water is a big plus.

I have looked around and got my sights on a 

I have looked around a bit and i got my sights on a Sage Barista BES875. It looks like a solid machine with enough bells and whistles to keep her busy during her ""getting into it"" phase until she settles into her preferred routine. I like the all metal look (i dont know if internals are also metal) and it looks classic and solid. I also like that it has some smart storage options so it wont clutter up the countertop with all the small parts.

What do you think? Should i go for it or are there better options, if so, whats better and why?

The price for the BES875 is 699USD, anything around  that or lower is fine, i can also stretch a bit if theres reason for it.

Thank you all for your insight!

1nbip97,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nbip97,Help with layout in narrow living room with multiple doorways,"Hi everyone, hoping I can get some help as I am desperate to change the living room but completely stuck with the layout. Before I can look at changing the furniture etc, I need some help with the layout of the room, and the use of space.

I have added a floorpan of the room, and some photos of it. The dimensions of the room size are correct (in cm) but the size of the current furniture is not measured. The current furniture was given by some family to tide us over, we will not be keeping it. It is also really bulky.. so there should be more room (at least feel like it) once we get more regular sized furniture.

My question is - how would you design the layout for this room, to include more furniture but without impacting the flow of traffic between the three doors (two interior doors either side of fire place, leading to kitchen and hallway, and the double French doors to garden)?

- we will be getting rid of the current bulky sofa and armchairs, ideally replacing with a 2 seater sofa and 'loveseat' size armchair - but open to suggestions!
- I would like other furniture like bookcase / shelves, coffee tables etc.

Also we will be getting a smaller TV and moving it away from that corner. Ideally I would prefer NOT to mount it above the fireplace, but I can't see where else we could put it. 

If anyone is able to suggest how you would place things (open to furniture suggestions!) in this narrow room with 3 doors, without it feeling crowded and blocking the pathways, I'd be so grateful!

I work with someone on the weekends who is starting to get on my nerves for the following reasons.

1) I‚Äôm quite a heavy guy and do lots of hours so when I crouch down and get back up I make a ‚Äúhumph‚Äù noise, this co-worker pointed it out and almost tried to embarrass me about it in front of customers.

2) A customer said a Oat hot chocolate was an allergy and I began the process of explaining the book to them. This co-worker again tried to belittle me for it and make it seem like I was stupid for doing my job.

3) Breaks/toilet trips - A break on a 9 hour shift is 30 minutes, I take 32-35 as I don‚Äôt include how long it takes me to get to my break area. This co-worker from my mental records, is regularly taking 40 minute breaks and 20+ minutes in the toilet leaving me in the shit.

I met someone on Tinder.

Something about him made me think, ‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôs the one‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs finally him.‚Äù

A part of me just hopes that this time, fate will be kind --- because I‚Äôve been waiting, and I‚Äôve been a good boy all these years. üòä

¬†

Despite my hectic schedule --- constantly traveling from one country to another for business trips --- I told myself, ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll give it a shot. I‚Äôll make time to get to know him.‚Äù

¬†We started chatting, and while he would reply, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice the long gaps‚Ä¶ first a few minutes, then hours, sometimes even longer.

I kept pushing through, convincing myself that maybe he was just busy with work or personal things ‚Äì even at night.

Even though I don‚Äôt really believe in the whole ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù excuse, I tried to understand.

¬†

My schedule finally eased up a bit, so I asked him if he wanted to meet.

I could feel from our chats that he also wanted to, maybe he was just waiting for me to take the first step.

¬†I invited him to attend a mass service first, then have lunch and coffee after.

But then he surprised me --- he asked if I‚Äôd like to meet earlier and include a breakfast date too.

Of course, I said yes. I thought it was really sweet of him, and it meant we could spend the whole day together, from morning until late afternoon.

¬†

We finally met for breakfast --- at a place I chose.

At first, he looked pretty nervous -- you could tell from his gestures and the way his eyes moved.

I felt a little nervous too --- it‚Äôs been such a long time since I‚Äôve actually gone out on a date.

But once we started eating, we loosened up, and things felt a lot more natural.

¬†

We attended the 12 PM mass.

The mass ended, and we went out in peace. üòä

¬†Then we went to a restaurant for lunch and coffee --- his choice this time.

He forgot to make a reservation, so I quickly booked a table online.

We had to wait a few minutes, but it was fine --- we kept talking while we waited.

¬†We kept talking over lunch and coffee, getting to know each other a bit -- about our jobs, family backgrounds, and how we spend our free time and weekends.

¬†By the end, it was a really nice, relaxed date --- no pressure at all, just easy and enjoyable.

¬†Around 3 PM, he mentioned he needed to leave because his friends were waiting.

He had actually mentioned meeting them in our chats before, but I thought it was around 5 or 6 PM.

¬†

Anyway, we left the restaurant and started walking toward the nearest train station.

Halfway there, I said I wanted to stay in the area to buy something.

Truthfully, I just wanted to give him a little alone time before meeting his friends, which is why I didn‚Äôt ride the train with him.

We said our ‚ÄúNice meeting you, take care,‚Äù and then went our separate ways.

¬†I took my time walking and sent him a message: ‚ÄúThanks for today! I‚Äôm really happy we met. I like the vibe -- so easy and chill.‚Äù

He replied, ‚ÄúMe too, looking forward to the cooking show,‚Äù since I had mentioned that I enjoy cooking.

¬†And after that, it fell back into the same pattern --- chatting, waiting, and wondering when, or if, he would reply.

But I kept the conversation going, starting with a simple question‚Äîasking if he had time to chat‚Äîbecause this was the only way for us to get to know each other.

Still, it ended up being the same waiting game.

¬†I‚Äôm going to be busy at the end of this month, so I asked if he wanted to come over to my place to finally fulfill my promise of cooking for him.

He said he didn‚Äôt have any plans that weekend but would let me know if he could make it. Hehe.

¬†Two days later, he messaged me saying he thought he could come over.

I replied with a simple, ‚ÄúSee you,‚Äù to seal the plan. Haha.

¬†I planned everything and cooked what I think was my best meal. When he arrived, I showed him around my place.

We had lunch and ended up talking non-stop for a full five hours.

¬†During our conversation, I finally found the courage to ask about his pattern of replying to messages.

He admitted it wasn‚Äôt about being busy --- it was intentional.

He said that in the past, people he chatted with would do the same to him, so he just mirrored their behavior.

¬†Hearing that honestly raised a little red flag for me.

It made me pause and think --- if this is how he treats communication, how will it play out in a relationship?

I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a mix of frustration and concern, even though I still enjoyed our time together.

¬†Our meetup ended well. I walked him to the train station, we said goodbye, and he later messaged me, ‚ÄúThanks a lot!‚Äù

¬†\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hey, you.

¬†I know you‚Äôve been hurt in the past --- ignored, replaced, or maybe overlooked.

But don‚Äôt let that shape how you treat people moving forward.

Don‚Äôt build walls or hold back because of what others did.

¬†It‚Äôs natural to want to protect yourself, but I hope you can pause and reflect: not everyone is the same.

Let your past guide you, not limit you, and stay open to the good in others.

¬†My intentions are pure, gentle, and kind. I truly like you, deeply and sincerely, from the bottom of my heart.

But please don‚Äôt make me pay for the hurt others have caused.

Or maybe I should take this as a signal that you‚Äôre not feeling the same.

Long story short, we met around mid-July on a dating app, a few days after I downloaded it. She liked my profile, I took a look at hers and liked her back.

We hit things off straight off the bat, checked each other's boxes massively on paper. We'd have long phone calls every few days and they just flowed, easily. We'd end up talking for 4-5 hours every time. Looking back, we spoke every single day from the day we met, till the day it ended.

We were supposed to meet up towards the end of the second week, but I got really ill and had to cancel. My schedule was packed for the next few weeks, so we rescheduled quite a way out. In the interim, things carried on as normal.

At some point, we talked about our pasts, which ended up being weirdly similar. One trauma-bonded relationship for our entire adult lives, which both ended around the same time at the start of the year for us both. We were both each other's first ""talking-stage"" since then. She mentioned she had avoidant tendencies at this point - which should've raised alarm bells in my head, looking back.

Things somehow got pretty intense prior to the first date. She was planning future dates before the first. She'd told her mum about me at some point, who had now begun to ask about me every day. Intense, but I liked the girl so I found it endearing.

Anyways - we met for an ice-breaker coffee date. My first actual date with a new person (I was friends for a long time with my ex before we dated). Nerves & expectations were up for both of us, as we'd spent so long building up rapport. It was awkward at first, but we slowly got into it. She told me I was even better looking in person, which was cute. We ended up spending 4/5 hours together instead of the one we planned. Anyways, the date ended really strong, with her excited to see me again and me feeling the same. This is where everything went upside down.

We carried on talking after as it had been before the date, with our next date being planned for the following weekend. She went abroad with her friends for a few days and basically fell off the face of the Earth. I told her to have a good time, we'll chat when she's back and to just send me snaps etc to keep me in the loop, so I know she's good. She enthusiastically said she would - but I got complete radio silence the entire time she was away.

When she came back, I hit her with a relatively light message letting her know I'd realised and that we should try to communicate a bit more, as I don't like the feeling of being left in the dark.

That's when she dropped the clich√© lines on me, all via voice note:

* I realised I pulled back and it's not fair to you.
* I feel like I'm not ready to get to know someone, because of baggage etc.
* Speaking to you has made me realise I'm not ready
* All the best, goodbyes etc

I asked her to make some time and we'd speak on the phone, rather than ending things over voice notes. We got on the phone and she was just saying the same stuff. I asked her to just be straight with me, is it about us or about readiness - to which she said ""It's 50/50, I'm unsure about us but it's more that I'm not in a good place"". I said being unsure about us is normal, we've only been on one date and that we can just slow the pace down. She said she wouldn't want things to get further on and disappoint or hurt me. At this point, I told her that it's all good - that she should do what she needs to do and if things change down the line, feel free to reach out and if I'm available, we'll chat again, to which she said yeah to. We said our goodbyes.

Long story short, an hour later we were talking again. Her birthday had lined up with the second date and I'd gotten her something for it. Early days, but it felt right and was more of a gag-gift with one of our inside jokes, not anything serious. She asked to see it, I showed her it when I got home. She found it cute and then asked ""btw, what did you have planned for the second date?""

I told her, she responded with ""omg that sounds so good, that would've been a good shout for real""

To which I responded with ""Yeah it is. As I said, do what you need to do, then reach out and we'll revisit, else we'll never get to know about us""

She listened to the message and then....blocked me literally everywhere but Instagram, for some reason.

I realised the next day, and hit her with a message on insta ""realised you've blocked me, not sure what's triggered it - but no hard feelings, all the best"". She left this on read and then five days later, blocked me on Instagram.



If things had just ended normally, I'd have been fine, it's the entire post-phone call sequence which has had me baffled. It's crazy how you can go from good morning texts to blocked within the span of a few days. I think I'm more triggered by the blatant potential we both saw, without actually giving it a chance to see what it could become / not become, than anything else. Do I figure out a way to reach out and see what can be done, or just close the chapter?",2,1757321122.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Below are venues (for \~50-75 people mostly, but some up to 120) in San Francisco that, to the best of my knowledge, are under 10k (some I didn't bother to reach out to get final numbers but felt confident in my estimate):

  
1. Randall Museum - pretty views, parking lot, a little funky to make work but could be worth it  
2. Stern Grove - on a lot of lists, seems stressful with 2 weddings per day, but sounds like you can rent the whole day.   
3. All the park areas in GGP - I liked the area near the Log Cabin and Fuschia Dell best, but there are others. Actually all parks throughout the city! I also contemplated Golden Gate Heights Park and McLaren Redwood Playground.  
4. The Commons (Hayes Valley), looks super cozy - reception only  
5. Manny's (Mission) - also cozy looking - reception only  
6. Marigold Event Space - reception only  
7. Neon - Backyard area looks like it has potential  
8. Sunnyside Conservatory  
9. Building 989 - this is at the end of Crissy Field parking lot near Fort Point. Very basic looking office room, but only 200/hr.   
10. Lawn Bowling Club (GGP) - they probably assume you are renting for a work event or something, comes with free lawn bowling lessons. Still thinking about renting as a welcome event.   
11. Mechanics Institute - this is clearly meant more for work events as well, and I didn't reach out to see how they would feel about weddings, but it looks like a cool building (I found it through searching for historical businesses or buildings in sf I think. I did a lot of deep dives).  
12. Irish Cultural Center - has a bunch of different options, but I think they might be demolishing this building and putting a new one in its place in the next couple years.  
13. Peacock Lounge  
14. Lake Merced Boathouse   
15. There are lots of community centers listed online, the only one that I thought had a cute inside area was Cabrillo but outside is playground. None of them allow alcohol.   
16. San Francisco Zoo - Honestly though they seem plagued with drama, not sure worth the risk.  
17. Bazaar Cafe (Outer Richmond) - Back area and cafe available to rent, but has to be after 4pm. 

  
Venues probably on the higher end but look good:  
1. SF Maritime Museum - loved this one, but they just redid contracts to be more money and have a lot more rules. No coffee or red wine. Must use elevator not stairs to bring everything up. If I remember Saturdays are 15k but other days are 9k or less.  
2. Klamath Historical Ferry   
3. Golden Gate Yacht Club - Room fee is 4-5k, but then you need to use certain vendors and their food so will end up being a lot more. So pretty though.   
4. The Box SF looked cool but I never reached out to them for actual prices. They might be over 10k.  
5. As many posts have said, there are lots of options on peerspace, or choosing a non-weekend day makes a lot of expensive places affordable. We were definitely doing a Saturday so I don't have a lot of those options here. There are a lot of museums that I didn't look further into because it looked like a lot of hard surfaces and too loud, but worth checking out if that doesn't bother you.",1,1757320917.0,SanFranciscoWeddings,1,1.0,False

Funnily enough, since we go to the same University, we actually had some mutuals on Instagram and she also popped up on my Instagram suggested profiles. 

Anyways, after texting back and forth for a bit, initially on Hinge, and then we moved to Instagram, she suggested we get coffee on campus. The date goes great, I think we both have the same type of humour and shared we some really interesting and fun stories. Near the end of the date, she asked me to rate how I thought this date was going, and I gave it a nine. She said ‚Äúyeah same‚Äù with a big smile on her face. We ended the date with a hug and she seemed to be genuinely happy even as I left (around 6:30).

A few hours later I shared with her something really funny that happened. Fast forward a day and a half, no response.

I opened the car door from where I was in the backseat and stumbled out, legs not ready to bear my weight after sitting for so long. I stare up at our rented house.

‚ÄúWhat do you think, Quini?‚Äù My Nonna asks me from behind. It was an average house, not anything too appealing but alright.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright I guess.‚Äù I reply, going to the back of our Subaru and opening the boot.

‚ÄúJust alright eh, Joaquini?‚Äù My Nonno queries, chuckling softly.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ Just alright.‚Äù I respond, sticking firmly to my original statement. I lug my bag out of the boot and start up the front of the house. Inside wasn‚Äôt any better, just the basics, kitchen, living-room, bathrooms, and bedrooms, nothing special. While my Nonno and Nonna looked around and inspected the rooms, muttering

‚ÄúThey could have done a better job with the paintwork‚Äù and

‚ÄúThey should have put wood tiles here or at least polished concrete‚Äù and something to that effect, I unpacked in the room that my grandparents gestured at when arranging bedrooms. It was dark so I just turned the light on. I moved and arranged stuff to my liking, and then looked out the window‚Ä¶ The thing was‚Ä¶ There was no window, just a wall painted over where a window should have been, that‚Äôs why it was so dark.¬†

‚ÄúHey, erm, aren‚Äôt there meant to be windows in my room?‚Äù I bellowed down the hall. The only response were 2 sets of feet marching to my room to inspect it. When my grandparents reached my room, they stood in the doorway and my Nonno looked annoyed.

‚ÄúJoaquin, there‚Äôs a window right there.‚Äù Nonno said and pointed to the wall. I looked and there really was a window, a slightly grimy glass panel sat there. But it was wrong‚Ä¶ It was like it wasn‚Äôt meant to be there, it looked like it was slapped in the last second, crooked. Sunlight streamed through and dust billowed in the light.¬†

‚ÄúOh, I must have missed it‚Ä¶‚Äù I say, a bit confused, knowing I couldn‚Äôt have possibly missed the window. What an odd thing‚Ä¶ A peculiar thing it was‚Ä¶ I tried to find a reasonable explanation, maybe a curtain was covering the window and was swept away by a breeze just as my grandparents entered, but of course I didn‚Äôt believe it, I knew something funny was happening. I looked back out the window and I got a good view of the driveway. My Nonno and Nonna exchanged concerned and worried glances and just kind of stayed there supervising my window gazing, still sharing concerned glances, and muttering under their breath. I saw a group of kids around my age through the window, some running, some riding bikes, passing through the street. And then suddenly, one stopped, and stared straight at me, through the window. I was definitely a bit more than weird out by this, more than just unnerved. Nonna saw them too and said to me

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go play with those kids, you‚Äôll want some friends to play with for the 2 weeks holiday.‚Äù¬†

I shrugged and without hesitation, walked past them, out the door, and walked towards the group, sliding shoes onto my feet. I wanted to escape the house, I was a bit concerned about my own behaviour, I‚Äôll admit that‚Ä¶ I walked towards the group and when I came up to them, they paused and looked at me.¬†

‚ÄúErm, hi, i‚Äôm Joaquin and er‚Ä¶‚Äù I break off, a bit nervous and not knowing what to say. The kids look at me and then to others in the group. A boy who was probably around 15 or 16 with short curly blonde hair looked up from the phone he was holding and stated matter-of-factly:

‚ÄúSeems like a new kid in the neighborhood.‚Äù And then all the kids threw up their hands in a slight applause, chattering amongst themselves loudly. I heard one, a girl, who had glossy straight hair, pretty eyes and looked around 12 or 13, say

‚ÄúFinally, it‚Äôs been boring around here.‚Äù The cheering went on for a few more seconds before a boy my age said to another

‚ÄúGive him your bike, Eloise, let him ride it.‚Äù Eloise, who was indeed on a bike, looked a bit reluctant but handed me the bike.¬†

‚ÄúEr, thanks.‚Äù I mutter. With that, they introduced themselves. The girl who made the comment about ‚Äòit‚Äôs been boring around here‚Äô was named Hannah and Mitch, the one that was on the phone, was her older brother and was 16, reluctantly tagging along with his sister‚Äôs younger friends. Erica was another in the group, a lanky 14 year old girl with curly long black hair. She was shy but very nice and polite. Eloise, the one who gave me the bike, was a 9 year old girl, and I found her really weird. She whispered to me

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go through the windows‚Ä¶ The sky behind them isn't ours‚Ä¶‚Äù And despite how quiet she was, the rest of the group gave her disapproving looks and said something along the lines of 'Don't tell him any of that crap just yet, don‚Äôt want to scare the new kid away, do we?‚Äô. I found this behaviour very odd but I said nothing, leaving the thoughts swirling through the abyss of my cranium. There were a bunch more kids, some younger than me, some older but I couldn‚Äôt have possibly remembered all their names just yet‚Ä¶ Though I remember the names, Charlie, Peter, and Jake but don‚Äôt remember who those names belonged to. A dog emerged from the brush on the side of the street and ran up to Mitch, panting madly. Mitch dropped to his knees, shoving his phone into his pocket and patted the dog, praising it as he did so. This must have been Mitch‚Äôs and Hannah‚Äôs dog.¬†

‚ÄúSo, do the rest of you have any pets?‚Äù I ask lamely, in hopes of starting a conversation. A few nod their heads.¬†

‚ÄúI used to‚Ä¶ It was just a little kitten.‚Äù Erica says, dreamily.

‚ÄúEr, what happened?‚Äù I ask, curious and a little uncomfortable.

‚ÄúWent through the windows‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre wrong you know‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat!?‚Äù I asked, a little too loud and Erica put a hand to her lips even though the whole group was listening anyway.

‚ÄúAre yours wrong too?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ They are, what‚Äôs going on? Do you know what‚Äôs wrong with them?‚Äù I asked, pushing the words out of my mouth at mach 5.¬†

‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with them, but the sky through them‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt ours‚Ä¶ Goodbye for now, see ya tomorrow.‚Äù And with that she strolled away, waving while the rest shouted ‚Äògoodbyes‚Äô. As I walked back up the driveway, I thought about the group‚Äôs odd behaviour and the phrase they‚Äôve been repeating to me, ‚ÄòThe sky that isn‚Äôt ours‚Äô or something like that. A chill ran down my spine just thinking about that creepy phrase. I take my shoes off slowly, and pause as I am about to enter the house. I take a deep breath and stroll in, plastering a neutral expression on my face.¬†

‚ÄúAh, Quini, I was just about to come looking for you, we got some Domino Pizza.‚Äù My Nonna tells me, her voice coming from the living room. I go into the living room and act normal, eating pizza, though I didn‚Äôt have much of an appetite, answering questions normally, and just acting normal over all. We turn on the TV and watch a news program, a gardening program, and then a quiz program. After a while, my grandparents say it‚Äôs time for bed so I shower and brush my teeth and jump into bed. I look over at the window, and for a split second I think I see the faint silhouettes of the group of kids, standing in the streets looking through my window, and then I slowly fall into sleep, falling through a hole in a glass bridge suspended in the cosmos‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm standing in a dark hallway, there are locked doors on both sides, grass growing from the small spaces between the door and the floor. I walk to the end of the hallway and there is a boarded up window, light seeping in through the cracks. I grab the edge of one of the boards and pull. The board comes away in my hand, the nails providing no resistance. Sunlight gushes in and I am temporarily blinded. I look out the window and a surreal scene meets my gaze‚Ä¶ Grass, stretching out endlessly and I can‚Äôt see anything else in the distance, no buildings or anything, just grass and a bright cloudless blue sky. Nostalgia washes over me, I don‚Äôt know why it was nostalgic to me but it was, like a liminal space‚Ä¶ Dread starts to build up in me, the space seems frozen in time, so isolated and unknown. And for just a fraction of a second, I swear I see a white figure way in the distance before the image fades away and I wake up, gasping for air, pillow and blanket wet with sweat. It was all just a dream and now I am awake and it‚Äôs morning. I hear the sound of a coffee machine in the kitchen, this tells me that Nonno and Nonna are up. I get up, shaky on my knees and exit my room, stumbling into the kitchen.

‚ÄúGood morning, Joaquin.‚Äù Nonno says, clapping his hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúGet a good sleep?‚Äù He asks.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I lie.

‚ÄúI had a weird dream‚Ä¶‚Äù I then explained to him what happened in the dream, Nonna coming into the kitchen in the middle of my explanation of the dream. Nonno and Nonna nod at all the right places, exchanging a ‚Äòthat's interesting‚Äô and a ‚Äòweird indeed‚Äô every now and then. I finish telling them what happened in my dream and grabbed myself a bowl and poured oats into it. I sit down in the living room and eat slowly, thinking about the strange events that have happened lately. I finish my oats and place the bowl in the sink, filling it up with water.¬†

‚ÄúHey Nonna, are we doing anything today?‚Äù I ask as I pass her by the coffee machine.

‚ÄúWere going to go to the beach later, maybe in an hour or 2.‚Äù Nonna responds, tampering with the coffee machine.

‚ÄúAlright, mind if I go for a walk?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúJust make sure to come back soon, Quini.‚Äù She responds.

‚ÄúAlright then, see ya.‚Äù I say to her and then I walk out the house as she says ‚Äòbye Quini‚Äô. Nonno is in the Subaru, talking on the phone, a business call I assume. I wave at him as I walk down the driveway and he waves back. I reach the end of the drive and step onto the street. I walk down the street, the air crisp and cool, great trees casting shade over me, serving as guardians from the‚Ä¶ Sky‚Ä¶ The sky that isn‚Äôt ours‚Ä¶ I reached a part of the street where all the houses were new or had just been built not too long ago. I noticed something off immediately. The place where windows should have been were boarded up!‚ÄúWhat the hell!‚Äù I practically shout to myself.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell indeed‚Ä¶‚Äù A voice says from behind me. I whirl around. It was a red-haired boy. Charlie, or was it Jake? Nah it was Peter‚Ä¶ I think. And behind him was Erica, Hannah, Mitch, and Eloise. The group was much smaller today.¬†

‚ÄúThe boarded up windows‚Ä¶ Indeed weird, what the hell for sure.‚Äù Erica says.

‚ÄúYou know, boarded windows ain‚Äôt about keeping people out. Sometimes it‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the other side that needs keeping in.‚Äù A voice of an old man says, coming from behind us. We all turn around and I see an old man standing there. Recognition clicked in the eyes of the group, except for me though.

‚ÄúGood morning Mr. Keating.‚Äù My group says in unison.¬†

‚ÄúGood morning kids.‚Äù He responds and then looks towards me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I've seen you before‚Ä¶‚Äù The man says, matter-of-factly.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the new kid, Joaquin, Mr. Keating.‚Äù The red-haired boy says to the man.¬†

‚ÄúWell that makes sense‚Ä¶ Heed my warning young man.‚Äù And with that the man strolls away.

‚ÄúWho was that man?‚Äù I ask immediately once the man is out of earshot.

‚ÄúMr. Keating, the old handyman.‚Äù Hannah replies.

‚ÄúHe was creepy, I didn‚Äôt even hear him sneak up on us.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúWe got used to it, man.‚Äù Mitch responds.

‚ÄúWhat was that he said? Something about keeping something in-‚Äù I start and Eloise cuts me off-

‚Äùboarded windows ain‚Äôt about keeping people out. Sometimes it‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the other side that needs keeping in.‚Äù She recites with ease in a monotone voice, as if she was reading off somewhere.

‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sick of this! What the hell is going around here? There is something weird going on and you guys know it! What is this, some sort of prank?‚Äù I ask, raising my voice. They just stood there, looking at me and then to the houses.

‚ÄúNo, not a prank, this is real alright.‚Äù Eloise says softly and dreamily before the words spew out of my mouth immediately after she finishes speaking.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the beach later today. So that‚Äôs why tomorrow, we're going to sneak into one of those houses with the boarded up windows and pry the boards off! And then we‚Äôll go through the windows and into the sky that isn‚Äôt ours!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good ide-‚Äù Eloise starts but I cut her off-

‚ÄúTomorrow at noon, we‚Äôre prying those boards off. I don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs behind them, I need to see it. Bring the whole group.‚Äù

Eloise‚Äôs face went pale, but I turned and stormed off before she could say anything else. We go to the beach and I bodysurf waves.¬†

‚ÄúThe waves are nasty here.‚Äù Nonna says.¬†

‚ÄúThey slam down on you and pummel you into the sand if you're not careful.‚Äù She adds in.

I catch them just fine, I don‚Äôt even get slammed into the sand. I think about everything, the weird disappearing and reappearing window in my room, the group of kids, the weird dream, the strange handyman, and the houses with boarded up windows. I think about our plan to break into one of the houses at noon. Just thinking about this sends chills running smack down my spine, the sky that isn‚Äôt ours‚Ä¶ Well, we‚Äôre going to be there soon‚Ä¶ The endless liminal grassland awaits us. We stop at a restaurant on the way back from the beach, we eat and then leave again. And then to my great annoyance, we stopped at a jazz club. The music there seems warped and distorted, and they played a sad slow ambient piece that filled me with dread. We stayed there so long it was already night when we were heading back home. I jump into bed back at home, Nonna doesn't know I forgot to have a shower and brush my teeth, ah well‚Ä¶ I look out the window and I see a flicker of the liminal grassland, the grass stretching out endlessly, and the white figure is in the distance, waiting for me. And then I fall into sleep, falling through a hole in a glass bridge suspended in the cosmos‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know where I got that phrase from‚Ä¶ Glass bridge suspended in the cosmos‚Ä¶ Weird‚Ä¶ In the morning I awaken from my dreamless slumber. I open my heavy eyelids and just kind of lay there, staring at the plain roof. I listened for the sounds of cutlery clanking, the coffee machine buzzing but I didn‚Äôt hear any of those. In fact, I hear nothing, just a deafening silence‚Ä¶ I slowly get out of bed and walk out of my room, looking behind me as I did so. I saw the liminal grassland through the window. In a fit of rage and confusion, I sprint to the window and raise my fists, and then slam them hard into-

‚ÄúAh, shit!‚Äù I yelp as my fists connect with a solid wall, completely devoid of any windows. I was boiling with frustration, and my hands were boiling with pain, red and raw. I just stood there, standing in front of the wall, seething with hatred. I walk away and into the kitchen.

‚ÄúNonna? Nonno?‚Äù I call out, but the only response was the dull silence. I reached the conclusion that they must still be sleeping, but I then spotted a lined piece of paper that had seemed to be lazily ripped out of a notebook with scrawled cursive handwriting. It read:



*To Joaqyuin*

*Me and Nonno have gone shopping at a mall nearby,*¬†

*We will be back soon, call us if you need anything.*

*XOXO Nonna*



After reading the note, I flip it over, grab a pen, and then hastily wrote:



*Gone out to play*



Then I scrambled out the front door, and down the drive. I reached the part of the street where the houses had all their windows boarded up. ‚ÄòCrap‚Äô, I thought, I didn't even check the time, I might have been too early and would have had to spend an annoyingly long time waiting for the rest of the group. I waited on the side of the street for a while. It felt like forever to me, and just when I decided I didn‚Äôt need company to see what was behind the windows, I heard footsteps approaching. I looked up, and saw the whole group, fully complete except for Eloise, the little wuss. They stopped when I saw them and¬† just stood there, staring at me. After an awkward moment of silence, Erica approached me and put a hand on my shoulder.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready, but you know‚Ä¶‚Äù She took a deep breath

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to do this.‚Äù I looked up at her, staring straight at her eyes and said:

‚ÄúYes we do! I am sick of all of this, the boarded up windows, the sky that isn‚Äôt ours, and that weird creepy liminal grasslands that I keep seeing! Don‚Äôt you guys want to know what‚Äôs behind all of this? I am sick of it, today, we will find out the truth for ourselves!‚Äù They all nodded at me and saluted a salute I would have laughed at in any other situation. I get up quickly, and then head for the closest house while the rest follow me. I reach a boarded up window, and while fuming with rage, frustration, and confusion, I punch through the fucking boards, splinters dug into my knuckles but I don‚Äôt care and keep going. I shred the boards and they fall away, hitting the ground with a dull thud. I look through and see what I know I will see‚Ä¶ The grassland, stretching out endlessly, nothing visible in the distance except for just grass, grass that probably went on forever. The sky is blue, stretched over the endless-flat landscape, no visible sun but somehow it‚Äôs still really bright. I see the white figure in the distance and emotions threaten to explode inside me.

‚ÄúOh, this ends NOW!!!‚Äù I shout, backing away from the window before sprinting at it as fast as my legs would carry me. I dive through the fucking window...

I opened the car door from where I was in the backseat and stumbled out, legs not ready to bear my weight after sitting for so long. I stare up at our rented house.

‚ÄúWhat do you think, Quini?‚Äù My Nonna asks me from behind. It was an average house, not anything too appealing but alright.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright I guess.‚Äù I reply, going to the back of our Subaru and opening the boot.

‚ÄúJust alright eh, Joaquini?‚Äù My Nonno queries, chuckling softly.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ Just alright.‚Äù I respond, sticking firmly to my original statement. I lug my bag out of the boot and start up the front of the house. Inside wasn‚Äôt any better, just the basics, kitchen, living-room, bathrooms, and bedrooms, nothing special. While my Nonno and Nonna looked around and inspected the rooms, muttering

‚ÄúThey could have done a better job with the paintwork‚Äù and

‚ÄúThey should have put wood tiles here or at least polished concrete‚Äù and something to that effect, I unpacked in the room that my grandparents gestured at when arranging bedrooms. It was dark so I just turned the light on. I moved and arranged stuff to my liking, and then looked out the window‚Ä¶ The thing was‚Ä¶ There was no window, just a wall painted over where a window should have been, that‚Äôs why it was so dark.¬†

‚ÄúHey, erm, aren‚Äôt there meant to be windows in my room?‚Äù I bellowed down the hall. The only response were 2 sets of feet marching to my room to inspect it. When my grandparents reached my room, they stood in the doorway and my Nonno looked annoyed.

‚ÄúJoaquin, there‚Äôs a window right there.‚Äù Nonno said and pointed to the wall. I looked and there really was a window, a slightly grimy glass panel sat there. But it was wrong‚Ä¶ It was like it wasn‚Äôt meant to be there, it looked like it was slapped in the last second, crooked. Sunlight streamed through and dust billowed in the light.¬†

‚ÄúOh, I must have missed it‚Ä¶‚Äù I say, a bit confused, knowing I couldn‚Äôt have possibly missed the window. What an odd thing‚Ä¶ A peculiar thing it was‚Ä¶ I tried to find a reasonable explanation, maybe a curtain was covering the window and was swept away by a breeze just as my grandparents entered, but of course I didn‚Äôt believe it, I knew something funny was happening. I looked back out the window and I got a good view of the driveway. My Nonno and Nonna exchanged concerned and worried glances and just kind of stayed there supervising my window gazing, still sharing concerned glances, and muttering under their breath. I saw a group of kids around my age through the window, some running, some riding bikes, passing through the street. And then suddenly, one stopped, and stared straight at me, through the window. I was definitely a bit more than weird out by this, more than just unnerved. Nonna saw them too and said to me

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go play with those kids, you‚Äôll want some friends to play with for the 2 weeks holiday.‚Äù¬†

I shrugged and without hesitation, walked past them, out the door, and walked towards the group, sliding shoes onto my feet. I wanted to escape the house, I was a bit concerned about my own behaviour, I‚Äôll admit that‚Ä¶ I walked towards the group and when I came up to them, they paused and looked at me.¬†

‚ÄúErm, hi, i‚Äôm Joaquin and er‚Ä¶‚Äù I break off, a bit nervous and not knowing what to say. The kids look at me and then to others in the group. A boy who was probably around 15 or 16 with short curly blonde hair looked up from the phone he was holding and stated matter-of-factly:

‚ÄúSeems like a new kid in the neighborhood.‚Äù And then all the kids threw up their hands in a slight applause, chattering amongst themselves loudly. I heard one, a girl, who had glossy straight hair, pretty eyes and looked around 12 or 13, say

‚ÄúFinally, it‚Äôs been boring around here.‚Äù The cheering went on for a few more seconds before a boy my age said to another

‚ÄúGive him your bike, Eloise, let him ride it.‚Äù Eloise, who was indeed on a bike, looked a bit reluctant but handed me the bike.¬†

‚ÄúEr, thanks.‚Äù I mutter. With that, they introduced themselves. The girl who made the comment about ‚Äòit‚Äôs been boring around here‚Äô was named Hannah and Mitch, the one that was on the phone, was her older brother and was 16, reluctantly tagging along with his sister‚Äôs younger friends. Erica was another in the group, a lanky 14 year old girl with curly long black hair. She was shy but very nice and polite. Eloise, the one who gave me the bike, was a 9 year old girl, and I found her really weird. She whispered to me

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go through the windows‚Ä¶ The sky behind them isn't ours‚Ä¶‚Äù And despite how quiet she was, the rest of the group gave her disapproving looks and said something along the lines of 'Don't tell him any of that crap just yet, don‚Äôt want to scare the new kid away, do we?‚Äô. I found this behaviour very odd but I said nothing, leaving the thoughts swirling through the abyss of my cranium. There were a bunch more kids, some younger than me, some older but I couldn‚Äôt have possibly remembered all their names just yet‚Ä¶ Though I remember the names, Charlie, Peter, and Jake but don‚Äôt remember who those names belonged to. A dog emerged from the brush on the side of the street and ran up to Mitch, panting madly. Mitch dropped to his knees, shoving his phone into his pocket and patted the dog, praising it as he did so. This must have been Mitch‚Äôs and Hannah‚Äôs dog.¬†

‚ÄúSo, do the rest of you have any pets?‚Äù I ask lamely, in hopes of starting a conversation. A few nod their heads.¬†

‚ÄúI used to‚Ä¶ It was just a little kitten.‚Äù Erica says, dreamily.

‚ÄúEr, what happened?‚Äù I ask, curious and a little uncomfortable.

‚ÄúWent through the windows‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre wrong you know‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat!?‚Äù I asked, a little too loud and Erica put a hand to her lips even though the whole group was listening anyway.

‚ÄúAre yours wrong too?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ They are, what‚Äôs going on? Do you know what‚Äôs wrong with them?‚Äù I asked, pushing the words out of my mouth at mach 5.¬†

‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with them, but the sky through them‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt ours‚Ä¶ Goodbye for now, see ya tomorrow.‚Äù And with that she strolled away, waving while the rest shouted ‚Äògoodbyes‚Äô. As I walked back up the driveway, I thought about the group‚Äôs odd behaviour and the phrase they‚Äôve been repeating to me, ‚ÄòThe sky that isn‚Äôt ours‚Äô or something like that. A chill ran down my spine just thinking about that creepy phrase. I take my shoes off slowly, and pause as I am about to enter the house.

Nonno and Nonna nod at all the right places, exchanging a ‚Äòthat's interesting‚Äô and a ‚Äòweird indeed‚Äô every now and then.

‚ÄúHey Nonna, are we doing anything today?‚Äù I ask as I pass her by the coffee machine.

‚ÄúAlright, mind if I go for a walk?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúJust make sure to come back soon, Quini.‚Äù She responds.

‚ÄúAlright then, see ya.‚Äù I say to her and then I walk out the house as she says ‚Äòbye Quini‚Äô. Nonno is in the Subaru, talking on the phone, a business call I assume.

‚ÄúYou know, boarded windows ain‚Äôt about keeping people out. Sometimes it‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the other side that needs keeping in.‚Äù A voice of an old man says, coming from behind us. We all turn around and I see an old man standing there. Recognition clicked in the eyes of the group, except for me though.

‚ÄúGood morning Mr. Keating.‚Äù My group says in unison.¬†

‚ÄúWell that makes sense‚Ä¶ Heed my warning young man.‚Äù And with that the man strolls away.

‚ÄúWho was that man?‚Äù I ask immediately once the man is out of earshot.

‚ÄúMr. Keating, the old handyman.‚Äù Hannah replies.

‚ÄúHe was creepy, I didn‚Äôt even hear him sneak up on us.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúWe got used to it, man.‚Äù Mitch responds.

‚ÄúWhat was that he said? Something about keeping something in-‚Äù I start and Eloise cuts me off-

I waited on the side of the street for a while. It felt like forever to me, and just when I decided I didn‚Äôt need company to see what was behind the windows, I heard footsteps approaching. I looked up, and saw the whole group, fully complete except for Eloise, the little wuss. They stopped when I saw them and¬† just stood there, staring at me. After an awkward moment of silence, Erica approached me and put a hand on my shoulder.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready, but you know‚Ä¶‚Äù She took a deep breath

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to do this.‚Äù I looked up at her, staring straight at her eyes and said:

‚ÄúYes we do! I am sick of all of this, the boarded up windows, the sky that isn‚Äôt ours, and that weird creepy liminal grasslands that I keep seeing! Don‚Äôt you guys want to know what‚Äôs behind all of this? I am sick of it, today, we will find out the truth for ourselves!‚Äù They all nodded at me and saluted a salute I would have laughed at in any other situation. I get up quickly, and then head for the closest house while the rest follow me. I reach a boarded up window, and while fuming with rage, frustration, and confusion, I punch through the fucking boards, splinters dug into my knuckles but I don‚Äôt care and keep going. I shred the boards and they fall away, hitting the ground with a dull thud. I look through and see what I know I will see‚Ä¶ The grassland, stretching out endlessly, nothing visible in the distance except for just grass, grass that probably went on forever. The sky is blue, stretched over the endless-flat landscape, no visible sun but somehow it‚Äôs still really bright. I see the white figure in the distance and emotions threaten to explode inside me.

‚ÄúOh, this ends NOW!!!‚Äù I shout, backing away from the window before sprinting at it as fast as my legs would carry me. I dive through the fucking window...

I opened the car door from where I was in the backseat and stumbled out, legs not ready to bear my weight after sitting for so long. I stare up at our rented house.

‚ÄúWhat do you think, Quini?‚Äù My Nonna asks me from behind. It was an average house, not anything too appealing but alright.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright I guess.‚Äù I reply, going to the back of our Subaru and opening the boot.

‚ÄúJust alright eh, Joaquini?‚Äù My Nonno queries, chuckling softly.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ Just alright.‚Äù I respond, sticking firmly to my original statement. I lug my bag out of the boot and start up the front of the house. Inside wasn‚Äôt any better, just the basics, kitchen, living-room, bathrooms, and bedrooms, nothing special. While my Nonno and Nonna looked around and inspected the rooms, muttering

‚ÄúThey could have done a better job with the paintwork‚Äù and

‚ÄúThey should have put wood tiles here or at least polished concrete‚Äù and something to that effect, I unpacked in the room that my grandparents gestured at when arranging bedrooms. It was dark so I just turned the light on. I moved and arranged stuff to my liking, and then looked out the window‚Ä¶ The thing was‚Ä¶ There was no window, just a wall painted over where a window should have been, that‚Äôs why it was so dark.¬†

‚ÄúHey, erm, aren‚Äôt there meant to be windows in my room?‚Äù I bellowed down the hall. The only response were 2 sets of feet marching to my room to inspect it. When my grandparents reached my room, they stood in the doorway and my Nonno looked annoyed.

‚ÄúJoaquin, there‚Äôs a window right there.‚Äù Nonno said and pointed to the wall. I looked and there really was a window, a slightly grimy glass panel sat there. But it was wrong‚Ä¶ It was like it wasn‚Äôt meant to be there, it looked like it was slapped in the last second, crooked. Sunlight streamed through and dust billowed in the light.¬†

‚ÄúOh, I must have missed it‚Ä¶‚Äù I say, a bit confused, knowing I couldn‚Äôt have possibly missed the window. What an odd thing‚Ä¶ A peculiar thing it was‚Ä¶ I tried to find a reasonable explanation, maybe a curtain was covering the window and was swept away by a breeze just as my grandparents entered, but of course I didn‚Äôt believe it, I knew something funny was happening. I looked back out the window and I got a good view of the driveway. My Nonno and Nonna exchanged concerned and worried glances and just kind of stayed there supervising my window gazing, still sharing concerned glances, and muttering under their breath. I saw a group of kids around my age through the window, some running, some riding bikes, passing through the street. And then suddenly, one stopped, and stared straight at me, through the window. I was definitely a bit more than weird out by this, more than just unnerved. Nonna saw them too and said to me

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go play with those kids, you‚Äôll want some friends to play with for the 2 weeks holiday.‚Äù¬†

I shrugged and without hesitation, walked past them, out the door, and walked towards the group, sliding shoes onto my feet. I wanted to escape the house, I was a bit concerned about my own behaviour, I‚Äôll admit that‚Ä¶ I walked towards the group and when I came up to them, they paused and looked at me.¬†

‚ÄúErm, hi, i‚Äôm Joaquin and er‚Ä¶‚Äù I break off, a bit nervous and not knowing what to say. The kids look at me and then to others in the group. A boy who was probably around 15 or 16 with short curly blonde hair looked up from the phone he was holding and stated matter-of-factly:

‚ÄúSeems like a new kid in the neighborhood.‚Äù And then all the kids threw up their hands in a slight applause, chattering amongst themselves loudly. I heard one, a girl, who had glossy straight hair, pretty eyes and looked around 12 or 13, say

‚ÄúFinally, it‚Äôs been boring around here.‚Äù The cheering went on for a few more seconds before a boy my age said to another

‚ÄúGive him your bike, Eloise, let him ride it.‚Äù Eloise, who was indeed on a bike, looked a bit reluctant but handed me the bike.¬†

‚ÄúEr, thanks.‚Äù I mutter. With that, they introduced themselves. The girl who made the comment about ‚Äòit‚Äôs been boring around here‚Äô was named Hannah and Mitch, the one that was on the phone, was her older brother and was 16, reluctantly tagging along with his sister‚Äôs younger friends. Erica was another in the group, a lanky 14 year old girl with curly long black hair. She was shy but very nice and polite. Eloise, the one who gave me the bike, was a 9 year old girl, and I found her really weird. She whispered to me

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go through the windows‚Ä¶ The sky behind them isn't ours‚Ä¶‚Äù And despite how quiet she was, the rest of the group gave her disapproving looks and said something along the lines of 'Don't tell him any of that crap just yet, don‚Äôt want to scare the new kid away, do we?‚Äô. I found this behaviour very odd but I said nothing, leaving the thoughts swirling through the abyss of my cranium. There were a bunch more kids, some younger than me, some older but I couldn‚Äôt have possibly remembered all their names just yet‚Ä¶ Though I remember the names, Charlie, Peter, and Jake but don‚Äôt remember who those names belonged to. A dog emerged from the brush on the side of the street and ran up to Mitch, panting madly. Mitch dropped to his knees, shoving his phone into his pocket and patted the dog, praising it as he did so. This must have been Mitch‚Äôs and Hannah‚Äôs dog.¬†

‚ÄúSo, do the rest of you have any pets?‚Äù I ask lamely, in hopes of starting a conversation. A few nod their heads.¬†

‚ÄúI used to‚Ä¶ It was just a little kitten.‚Äù Erica says, dreamily.

‚ÄúEr, what happened?‚Äù I ask, curious and a little uncomfortable.

‚ÄúWent through the windows‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre wrong you know‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat!?‚Äù I asked, a little too loud and Erica put a hand to her lips even though the whole group was listening anyway.

‚ÄúAre yours wrong too?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ They are, what‚Äôs going on? Do you know what‚Äôs wrong with them?‚Äù I asked, pushing the words out of my mouth at mach 5.¬†

‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with them, but the sky through them‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt ours‚Ä¶ Goodbye for now, see ya tomorrow.‚Äù And with that she strolled away, waving while the rest shouted ‚Äògoodbyes‚Äô. As I walked back up the driveway, I thought about the group‚Äôs odd behaviour and the phrase they‚Äôve been repeating to me, ‚ÄòThe sky that isn‚Äôt ours‚Äô or something like that. A chill ran down my spine just thinking about that creepy phrase. I take my shoes off slowly, and pause as I am about to enter the house. I take a deep breath and stroll in, plastering a neutral expression on my face.¬†

‚ÄúAh, Quini, I was just about to come looking for you, we got some Domino Pizza.‚Äù My Nonna tells me, her voice coming from the living room. I go into the living room and act normal, eating pizza, though I didn‚Äôt have much of an appetite, answering questions normally, and just acting normal over all. We turn on the TV and watch a news program, a gardening program, and then a quiz program. After a while, my grandparents say it‚Äôs time for bed so I shower and brush my teeth and jump into bed. I look over at the window, and for a split second I think I see the faint silhouettes of the group of kids, standing in the streets looking through my window, and then I slowly fall into sleep, falling through a hole in a glass bridge suspended in the cosmos‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm standing in a dark hallway, there are locked doors on both sides, grass growing from the small spaces between the door and the floor. I walk to the end of the hallway and there is a boarded up window, light seeping in through the cracks. I grab the edge of one of the boards and pull. The board comes away in my hand, the nails providing no resistance. Sunlight gushes in and I am temporarily blinded. I look out the window and a surreal scene meets my gaze‚Ä¶ Grass, stretching out endlessly and I can‚Äôt see anything else in the distance, no buildings or anything, just grass and a bright cloudless blue sky. Nostalgia washes over me, I don‚Äôt know why it was nostalgic to me but it was, like a liminal space‚Ä¶ Dread starts to build up in me, the space seems frozen in time, so isolated and unknown. And for just a fraction of a second, I swear I see a white figure way in the distance before the image fades away and I wake up, gasping for air, pillow and blanket wet with sweat. It was all just a dream and now I am awake and it‚Äôs morning. I hear the sound of a coffee machine in the kitchen, this tells me that Nonno and Nonna are up. I get up, shaky on my knees and exit my room, stumbling into the kitchen.

‚ÄúGood morning, Joaquin.‚Äù Nonno says, clapping his hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúGet a good sleep?‚Äù He asks.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I lie.

‚ÄúI had a weird dream‚Ä¶‚Äù I then explained to him what happened in the dream, Nonna coming into the kitchen in the middle of my explanation of the dream. Nonno and Nonna nod at all the right places, exchanging a ‚Äòthat's interesting‚Äô and a ‚Äòweird indeed‚Äô every now and then. I finish telling them what happened in my dream and grabbed myself a bowl and poured oats into it. I sit down in the living room and eat slowly, thinking about the strange events that have happened lately. I finish my oats and place the bowl in the sink, filling it up with water.¬†

‚ÄúHey Nonna, are we doing anything today?‚Äù I ask as I pass her by the coffee machine.

‚ÄúWere going to go to the beach later, maybe in an hour or 2.‚Äù Nonna responds, tampering with the coffee machine.

‚ÄúAlright, mind if I go for a walk?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúJust make sure to come back soon, Quini.‚Äù She responds.

‚ÄúAlright then, see ya.‚Äù I say to her and then I walk out the house as she says ‚Äòbye Quini‚Äô. Nonno is in the Subaru, talking on the phone, a business call I assume. I wave at him as I walk down the driveway and he waves back. I reach the end of the drive and step onto the street. I walk down the street, the air crisp and cool, great trees casting shade over me, serving as guardians from the‚Ä¶ Sky‚Ä¶ The sky that isn‚Äôt ours‚Ä¶ I reached a part of the street where all the houses were new or had just been built not too long ago. I noticed something off immediately. The place where windows should have been were boarded up!‚ÄúWhat the hell!‚Äù I practically shout to myself.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell indeed‚Ä¶‚Äù A voice says from behind me. I whirl around. It was a red-haired boy. Charlie, or was it Jake? Nah it was Peter‚Ä¶ I think. And behind him was Erica, Hannah, Mitch, and Eloise. The group was much smaller today.¬†

‚ÄúThe boarded up windows‚Ä¶ Indeed weird, what the hell for sure.‚Äù Erica says.

‚ÄúYou know, boarded windows ain‚Äôt about keeping people out. Sometimes it‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the other side that needs keeping in.‚Äù A voice of an old man says, coming from behind us. We all turn around and I see an old man standing there. Recognition clicked in the eyes of the group, except for me though.

‚ÄúGood morning Mr. Keating.‚Äù My group says in unison.¬†

‚ÄúGood morning kids.‚Äù He responds and then looks towards me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I've seen you before‚Ä¶‚Äù The man says, matter-of-factly.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the new kid, Joaquin, Mr. Keating.‚Äù The red-haired boy says to the man.¬†

‚ÄúWell that makes sense‚Ä¶ Heed my warning young man.‚Äù And with that the man strolls away.

‚ÄúWho was that man?‚Äù I ask immediately once the man is out of earshot.

‚ÄúMr. Keating, the old handyman.‚Äù Hannah replies.

‚ÄúHe was creepy, I didn‚Äôt even hear him sneak up on us.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúWe got used to it, man.‚Äù Mitch responds.

‚ÄúWhat was that he said? Something about keeping something in-‚Äù I start and Eloise cuts me off-

‚Äùboarded windows ain‚Äôt about keeping people out. Sometimes it‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the other side that needs keeping in.‚Äù She recites with ease in a monotone voice, as if she was reading off somewhere.

‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sick of this! What the hell is going around here? There is something weird going on and you guys know it! What is this, some sort of prank?‚Äù I ask, raising my voice. They just stood there, looking at me and then to the houses.

‚ÄúNo, not a prank, this is real alright.‚Äù Eloise says softly and dreamily before the words spew out of my mouth immediately after she finishes speaking.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the beach later today. So that‚Äôs why tomorrow, we're going to sneak into one of those houses with the boarded up windows and pry the boards off! And then we‚Äôll go through the windows and into the sky that isn‚Äôt ours!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good ide-‚Äù Eloise starts but I cut her off-

‚ÄúTomorrow at noon, we‚Äôre prying those boards off. I don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs behind them, I need to see it. Bring the whole group.‚Äù

Eloise‚Äôs face went pale, but I turned and stormed off before she could say anything else. We go to the beach and I bodysurf waves.¬†

‚ÄúThe waves are nasty here.‚Äù Nonna says.¬†

‚ÄúThey slam down on you and pummel you into the sand if you're not careful.‚Äù She adds in.

I catch them just fine, I don‚Äôt even get slammed into the sand. I think about everything, the weird disappearing and reappearing window in my room, the group of kids, the weird dream, the strange handyman, and the houses with boarded up windows. I think about our plan to break into one of the houses at noon. Just thinking about this sends chills running smack down my spine, the sky that isn‚Äôt ours‚Ä¶ Well, we‚Äôre going to be there soon‚Ä¶ The endless liminal grassland awaits us. We stop at a restaurant on the way back from the beach, we eat and then leave again. And then to my great annoyance, we stopped at a jazz club. The music there seems warped and distorted, and they played a sad slow ambient piece that filled me with dread. We stayed there so long it was already night when we were heading back home. I jump into bed back at home, Nonna doesn't know I forgot to have a shower and brush my teeth, ah well‚Ä¶ I look out the window and I see a flicker of the liminal grassland, the grass stretching out endlessly, and the white figure is in the distance, waiting for me. And then I fall into sleep, falling through a hole in a glass bridge suspended in the cosmos‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know where I got that phrase from‚Ä¶ Glass bridge suspended in the cosmos‚Ä¶ Weird‚Ä¶ In the morning I awaken from my dreamless slumber. I open my heavy eyelids and just kind of lay there, staring at the plain roof. I listened for the sounds of cutlery clanking, the coffee machine buzzing but I didn‚Äôt hear any of those. In fact, I hear nothing, just a deafening silence‚Ä¶ I slowly get out of bed and walk out of my room, looking behind me as I did so. I saw the liminal grassland through the window. In a fit of rage and confusion, I sprint to the window and raise my fists, and then slam them hard into-

‚ÄúAh, shit!‚Äù I yelp as my fists connect with a solid wall, completely devoid of any windows. I was boiling with frustration, and my hands were boiling with pain, red and raw. I just stood there, standing in front of the wall, seething with hatred. I walk away and into the kitchen.

‚ÄúNonna? Nonno?‚Äù I call out, but the only response was the dull silence. I reached the conclusion that they must still be sleeping, but I then spotted a lined piece of paper that had seemed to be lazily ripped out of a notebook with scrawled cursive handwriting. It read:



*To Joaqyuin*

*Me and Nonno have gone shopping at a mall nearby,*¬†

*We will be back soon, call us if you need anything.*

*XOXO Nonna*



After reading the note, I flip it over, grab a pen, and then hastily wrote:



*Gone out to play*



Then I scrambled out the front door, and down the drive. I reached the part of the street where the houses had all their windows boarded up. ‚ÄòCrap‚Äô, I thought, I didn't even check the time, I might have been too early and would have had to spend an annoyingly long time waiting for the rest of the group. I waited on the side of the street for a while. It felt like forever to me, and just when I decided I didn‚Äôt need company to see what was behind the windows, I heard footsteps approaching.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready, but you know‚Ä¶‚Äù She took a deep breath

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to do this.‚Äù I looked up at her, staring straight at her eyes and said:

‚ÄúYes we do! I am sick of all of this, the boarded up windows, the sky that isn‚Äôt ours, and that weird creepy liminal grasslands that I keep seeing! Don‚Äôt you guys want to know what‚Äôs behind all of this?

‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with them, but the sky through them‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt ours‚Ä¶ Goodbye for now, see ya tomorrow.‚Äù And with that she strolled away, waving while the rest shouted ‚Äògoodbyes‚Äô. As I walked back up the driveway, I thought about the group‚Äôs odd behaviour and the phrase they‚Äôve been repeating to me, ‚ÄòThe sky that isn‚Äôt ours‚Äô or something like that. A chill ran down my spine just thinking about that creepy phrase. I take my shoes off slowly, and pause as I am about to enter the house. I take a deep breath and stroll in, plastering a neutral expression on my face.¬†

‚ÄúAh, Quini, I was just about to come looking for you, we got some Domino Pizza.‚Äù My Nonna tells me, her voice coming from the living room. I go into the living room and act normal, eating pizza, though I didn‚Äôt have much of an appetite, answering questions normally, and just acting normal over all. We turn on the TV and watch a news program, a gardening program, and then a quiz program. After a while, my grandparents say it‚Äôs time for bed so I shower and brush my teeth and jump into bed. I look over at the window, and for a split second I think I see the faint silhouettes of the group of kids, standing in the streets looking through my window, and then I slowly fall into sleep, falling through a hole in a glass bridge suspended in the cosmos‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm standing in a dark hallway, there are locked doors on both sides, grass growing from the small spaces between the door and the floor. I walk to the end of the hallway and there is a boarded up window, light seeping in through the cracks. I grab the edge of one of the boards and pull. The board comes away in my hand, the nails providing no resistance. Sunlight gushes in and I am temporarily blinded. I look out the window and a surreal scene meets my gaze‚Ä¶ Grass, stretching out endlessly and I can‚Äôt see anything else in the distance, no buildings or anything, just grass and a bright cloudless blue sky. Nostalgia washes over me, I don‚Äôt know why it was nostalgic to me but it was, like a liminal space‚Ä¶ Dread starts to build up in me, the space seems frozen in time, so isolated and unknown. And for just a fraction of a second, I swear I see a white figure way in the distance before the image fades away and I wake up, gasping for air, pillow and blanket wet with sweat. It was all just a dream and now I am awake and it‚Äôs morning. I hear the sound of a coffee machine in the kitchen, this tells me that Nonno and Nonna are up. I get up, shaky on my knees and exit my room, stumbling into the kitchen.

‚ÄúGood morning, Joaquin.‚Äù Nonno says, clapping his hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúGet a good sleep?‚Äù He asks.

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I lie.

‚ÄúI had a weird dream‚Ä¶‚Äù I then explained to him what happened in the dream, Nonna coming into the kitchen in the middle of my explanation of the dream. Nonno and Nonna nod at all the right places, exchanging a ‚Äòthat's interesting‚Äô and a ‚Äòweird indeed‚Äô every now and then. I finish telling them what happened in my dream and grabbed myself a bowl and poured oats into it. I sit down in the living room and eat slowly, thinking about the strange events that have happened lately. I finish my oats and place the bowl in the sink, filling it up with water.¬†

‚ÄúHey Nonna, are we doing anything today?‚Äù I ask as I pass her by the coffee machine.

‚ÄúWere going to go to the beach later, maybe in an hour or 2.‚Äù Nonna responds, tampering with the coffee machine.

‚ÄúAlright, mind if I go for a walk?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúJust make sure to come back soon, Quini.‚Äù She responds.

‚ÄúAlright then, see ya.‚Äù I say to her and then I walk out the house as she says ‚Äòbye Quini‚Äô. Nonno is in the Subaru, talking on the phone, a business call I assume. I wave at him as I walk down the driveway and he waves back. I reach the end of the drive and step onto the street. I walk down the street, the air crisp and cool, great trees casting shade over me, serving as guardians from the‚Ä¶ Sky‚Ä¶ The sky that isn‚Äôt ours‚Ä¶ I reached a part of the street where all the houses were new or had just been built not too long ago. I noticed something off immediately. The place where windows should have been were boarded up!‚ÄúWhat the hell!‚Äù I practically shout to myself.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell indeed‚Ä¶‚Äù A voice says from behind me. I whirl around. It was a red-haired boy. Charlie, or was it Jake? Nah it was Peter‚Ä¶ I think. And behind him was Erica, Hannah, Mitch, and Eloise. The group was much smaller today.¬†

‚ÄúThe boarded up windows‚Ä¶ Indeed weird, what the hell for sure.‚Äù Erica says.

‚ÄúYou know, boarded windows ain‚Äôt about keeping people out. Sometimes it‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the other side that needs keeping in.‚Äù A voice of an old man says, coming from behind us. We all turn around and I see an old man standing there. Recognition clicked in the eyes of the group, except for me though.

‚ÄúGood morning Mr. Keating.‚Äù My group says in unison.¬†

‚ÄúGood morning kids.‚Äù He responds and then looks towards me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I've seen you before‚Ä¶‚Äù The man says, matter-of-factly.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the new kid, Joaquin, Mr. Keating.‚Äù The red-haired boy says to the man.¬†

‚ÄúWell that makes sense‚Ä¶ Heed my warning young man.‚Äù And with that the man strolls away.

‚ÄúWho was that man?‚Äù I ask immediately once the man is out of earshot.

‚ÄúMr. Keating, the old handyman.‚Äù Hannah replies.

‚ÄúHe was creepy, I didn‚Äôt even hear him sneak up on us.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúWe got used to it, man.‚Äù Mitch responds.

‚ÄúWhat was that he said? Something about keeping something in-‚Äù I start and Eloise cuts me off-

‚Äùboarded windows ain‚Äôt about keeping people out. Sometimes it‚Äôs what‚Äôs on the other side that needs keeping in.‚Äù She recites with ease in a monotone voice, as if she was reading off somewhere.

‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sick of this! What the hell is going around here? There is something weird going on and you guys know it! What is this, some sort of prank?‚Äù I ask, raising my voice. They just stood there, looking at me and then to the houses.

‚ÄúNo, not a prank, this is real alright.‚Äù Eloise says softly and dreamily before the words spew out of my mouth immediately after she finishes speaking.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the beach later today. So that‚Äôs why tomorrow, we're going to sneak into one of those houses with the boarded up windows and pry the boards off! And then we‚Äôll go through the windows and into the sky that isn‚Äôt ours!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a good ide-‚Äù Eloise starts but I cut her off-

‚ÄúTomorrow at noon, we‚Äôre prying those boards off. I don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs behind them, I need to see it. Bring the whole group.‚Äù

Eloise‚Äôs face went pale, but I turned and stormed off before she could say anything else. We go to the beach and I bodysurf waves.¬†

‚ÄúThe waves are nasty here.‚Äù Nonna says.¬†

‚ÄúThey slam down on you and pummel you into the sand if you're not careful.‚Äù She adds in.

I catch them just fine, I don‚Äôt even get slammed into the sand. I think about everything, the weird disappearing and reappearing window in my room, the group of kids, the weird dream, the strange handyman, and the houses with boarded up windows. I think about our plan to break into one of the houses at noon. Just thinking about this sends chills running smack down my spine, the sky that isn‚Äôt ours‚Ä¶ Well, we‚Äôre going to be there soon‚Ä¶ The endless liminal grassland awaits us. We stop at a restaurant on the way back from the beach, we eat and then leave again. And then to my great annoyance, we stopped at a jazz club. The music there seems warped and distorted, and they played a sad slow ambient piece that filled me with dread. We stayed there so long it was already night when we were heading back home. I jump into bed back at home, Nonna doesn't know I forgot to have a shower and brush my teeth, ah well‚Ä¶ I look out the window and I see a flicker of the liminal grassland, the grass stretching out endlessly, and the white figure is in the distance, waiting for me. And then I fall into sleep, falling through a hole in a glass bridge suspended in the cosmos‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know where I got that phrase from‚Ä¶ Glass bridge suspended in the cosmos‚Ä¶ Weird‚Ä¶ In the morning I awaken from my dreamless slumber. I open my heavy eyelids and just kind of lay there, staring at the plain roof. I listened for the sounds of cutlery clanking, the coffee machine buzzing but I didn‚Äôt hear any of those. In fact, I hear nothing, just a deafening silence‚Ä¶ I slowly get out of bed and walk out of my room, looking behind me as I did so. I saw the liminal grassland through the window. In a fit of rage and confusion, I sprint to the window and raise my fists, and then slam them hard into-

‚ÄúAh, shit!‚Äù I yelp as my fists connect with a solid wall, completely devoid of any windows. I was boiling with frustration, and my hands were boiling with pain, red and raw. I just stood there, standing in front of the wall, seething with hatred. I walk away and into the kitchen.

‚ÄúNonna? Nonno?‚Äù I call out, but the only response was the dull silence. I reached the conclusion that they must still be sleeping, but I then spotted a lined piece of paper that had seemed to be lazily ripped out of a notebook with scrawled cursive handwriting. It read:



*To Joaqyuin*

*Me and Nonno have gone shopping at a mall nearby,*¬†

*We will be back soon, call us if you need anything.*

*XOXO Nonna*



After reading the note, I flip it over, grab a pen, and then hastily wrote:



*Gone out to play*



Then I scrambled out the front door, and down the drive. I reached the part of the street where the houses had all their windows boarded up. ‚ÄòCrap‚Äô, I thought, I didn't even check the time, I might have been too early and would have had to spend an annoyingly long time waiting for the rest of the group. I waited on the side of the street for a while. It felt like forever to me, and just when I decided I didn‚Äôt need company to see what was behind the windows, I heard footsteps approaching. I looked up, and saw the whole group, fully complete except for Eloise, the little wuss. They stopped when I saw them and¬† just stood there, staring at me. After an awkward moment of silence, Erica approached me and put a hand on my shoulder.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready, but you know‚Ä¶‚Äù She took a deep breath

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to do this.‚Äù I looked up at her, staring straight at her eyes and said:

‚ÄúYes we do! I am sick of all of this, the boarded up windows, the sky that isn‚Äôt ours, and that weird creepy liminal grasslands that I keep seeing! Don‚Äôt you guys want to know what‚Äôs behind all of this? I am sick of it, today, we will find out the truth for ourselves!‚Äù They all nodded at me and saluted a salute I would have laughed at in any other situation. I get up quickly, and then head for the closest house while the rest follow me. I reach a boarded up window, and while fuming with rage, frustration, and confusion, I punch through the fucking boards, splinters dug into my knuckles but I don‚Äôt care and keep going. I shred the boards and they fall away, hitting the ground with a dull thud. I look through and see what I know I will see‚Ä¶ The grassland, stretching out endlessly, nothing visible in the distance except for just grass, grass that probably went on forever. The sky is blue, stretched over the endless-flat landscape, no visible sun but somehow it‚Äôs still really bright. I see the white figure in the distance and emotions threaten to explode inside me.

‚ÄúOh, this ends NOW!!!‚Äù I shout, backing away from the window before sprinting at it as fast as my legs would carry me. I dive through the fucking window...

So 5 days ago I made a new friend (a new girl in my class who is very shy and not). We became good friends and we match energy. We are really similar, but people started assuming the other. 

Third day she suggested we should go buy books for school and we went two of us it was fine she suggested we should eat something or get a coffee I said let's eat, ( I asked her where do you want to go,she said wherever do I want "")
We ate at a fast-food place. I paid for her food cuz I do that to all my new friends. She was surprised and offered to buy me a drink. Then we spend time in the park chatting, etc. ( we sit 80% in class together)

Then in class, my friend said that I am her heat and she was smiling and laughing about it. After class, I told my friend that it's not okay to say that about friends, and he said she might like you (he is friends with her also). I was like wtf dude, we only know each other for 5 days.

My friend said he caught her looking at me in class which I find odd.
And a lot of people say there is something between us like why do you think that we only became friends recently üò≠",3,1757320171.0,askteenboys,2,1.0,False
