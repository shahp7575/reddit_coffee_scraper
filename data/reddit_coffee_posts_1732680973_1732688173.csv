1h0xpz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1h0xpz3/how_stupid_is_this_idea/,How stupid is this idea?,"I know nothing about the law or all that much about economics. I just had an idea which seems stupid and likely *is* stupid and just wanted to know the faults with it.

What if, in the case of an individual vs a corporation- the corporation is made to pay a portion of the individual's attorney costs by default? Say, 10-20% and more if it works? Which they then make back if they win or it gets deducted from the victim's winnings or similar

So basically, it seems to me like there's a significant power differential between a corporation and a regular person. If the consumer or often employee is done injustice, then they have limited recourse beyond complaining and leaving a bad review or such. Depending on the infraction, maybe they can contact some other body like osha or something? (as I said my knowledge is limited). But often, if the corporation isnt willing to compensate then the only resort is suing (I think?) which is extremely intimidating since lawyers are expensive and companies tend to have far deeper pockets. I am thinking of stuff like the mcdonalds hot coffee case for example. Or they can just bluff a lawsuit which they dont have much legal standing on, but know they can drain the individuals pockets dry.

To me, the above idea seems like it could deter companies from doing such(atleast a bit) and give individuals more recourse. Intuitively it feels like it shouldnt work though, I am just not quite sure how.",1,1732687710.0,legal,0,1.0,False

I saw a similar post about another congolese woman who freindship was affected by the boycott. My freind is an arab woman as well, and has often seen me buy food from a particular place that is on boycott list for palestine. That place i buy food is the only work lunch i can really afford. About $2 - $6. sometimes i buy $1 doughnut, or 2$ coffee, or a bowl for around $5. Every other place close to me is around $15 per plate and even more. I make around $15 per hour and i really cannot spend my hourly pay on food. my freind happend to see me one day buying foo from there as i go back to my office, and the next day, she saw me in and goes "" oh i saw you yesterday with your food from \_\_\_"" and the tone sounds very judgemental and condescending. I replied, ""i just needed my coffee"". since then, we havent spoken to each other. We ignore each other. 

One of our freind who is also arab, was talking about a prof who told her one of her artworks about palestine was ""too violent"" and how she hated that prof and thought he was nice at first. My freind replied ""yeah, at first you always think they are kind"" and she looked at me, asif she meant that towards me. 

The duration of our freindship, she has never asked about congo and sudan. Not once. Never asked me about companies to boycott. Over the summer, she bought a new macbook, even if we had previously talked about boycotting apple, but she had ofcourse mentioned boycotting apple for palestine. She invited me to a few protests about palestine, and i didnt go to them with her as i felt so much trauma from the previous protest i went to for BLM where i had teargas thrown in the crowd, was arrested once, and had my broehrs eye socket damaged. I am terrified of protests after the george floyd one i attended. I explained this to her, but she said its because im victimoising myself as a black person. i almost feel as if she and her arab freind leave me out of certain conversations because im congolese, my sblings and cousins and i are the first in our generation to not be born into war. My great grand parents married and birthed  their children in war. Even my father has deep scars on his feet due to walking long distances during war. My nigerian mother had to carry her sister's head in a calabash at age 6 while her siblings carriued other body parts. My grandmother refused to speak english after the biafran war. She treats me like i dont know anything about struggle. 

In 1970, Bruce Mayrock self immolated in front of the UN during the biafran war. I told her I understood what it felt like for so many pro palestinians, after Matt Nelson self immolated in fornt of the isreali embassy. she simply ignored that message even if i was trying to create common ground for us to discuss genocide.

I dont feel supprted by my freind, and i feel i am being labelled pro genocide. I have spent half of my time in research speaqking about issues in the blakc community and with african politics and colonial powers. I have taught my coursemates so much about racism and africa, to the point i have had people tell me my research is life changing, but no comments from my best freind. I support her so much to paint about palestine, to be brave to create work even when profs dont agree, but i am being labelled pro genocide. 

I am so tired as a black woman that when i show my support to others, its never reciprocated. Almost like the situation in congo is just "" barbaric africans fighting against each other as always"" i cant almlost focus on africa without someone signalling ""what about us"", but how have you supported me? do you give me space to educate you too? almost every page dedicated to africa speaks about palestine actively.

1h0xm8q,https://i.redd.it/n1nh0bs0xd3e1.jpeg,Can I update my motion design ad if my product changes?,"
So your product has had a glow-up, huh? Maybe you‚Äôve added features, updated the design, or finally fixed that thing customers kept complaining about. (Yes, Steve, that thing.) But here‚Äôs the million-dollar question: does your motion design ad still make sense, or does it feel like it‚Äôs advertising a flip phone in a smartphone world? Spoiler: If your product has changed, your ad needs a matching wardrobe change.


---

üé® ‚ÄúMotion Design is Not a Tattoo‚Äù
Good news! Motion design isn‚Äôt permanent. It‚Äôs not a regrettable tattoo you got on spring break. It‚Äôs more like a hairstyle‚Äîeasy to change, tweak, or completely redo. New product feature? Update the text overlay. Different target audience? Adjust the tone and colors. The beauty of motion design is its motion‚Äîit evolves as fast as your product does. No laser removal required.


---

‚è≥ ‚ÄúWait, How Often Are We Talking Here?‚Äù
Let me guess‚Äîyou‚Äôre wondering if you‚Äôll have to update your motion design ad every other Tuesday. Relax! You don‚Äôt need to hit refresh every time your product sneezes. But if you‚Äôve added game-changing features, launched a whole new version, or pivoted from selling coffee mugs to rocket parts, then yeah, it‚Äôs time to give your ad a makeover. Because nothing screams ‚Äúout of touch‚Äù like a product ad that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ out of touch.


---

üé¢ ‚ÄúPlot Twist! Changes Can Be Exciting‚Äù
Updating your motion design ad isn‚Äôt a chore‚Äîit‚Äôs an opportunity! Think of it as a sequel, like Toy Story 2, not a reboot like Cats. You can introduce fresh animations, highlight exciting features, and maybe even flex that new logo you spent six months obsessing over. A well-timed update doesn‚Äôt just keep your ad relevant‚Äîit makes your audience sit up and say, ‚ÄúOoh, what‚Äôs new?‚Äù


---

üõë ‚ÄúBut Don‚Äôt Overdo It!‚Äù
Here‚Äôs the trap: updating too much. If you‚Äôre constantly tweaking your motion ad, it might confuse your audience faster than trying to explain cryptocurrency to your grandma. Consistency is key‚Äîyour updated ad should still feel like it‚Äôs from the same brand, even if it‚Äôs got a fresh new look. Think ‚Äúsubtle upgrade,‚Äù not ‚Äútotal personality transplant.‚Äù


---

üí° ‚ÄúPro Tip: Plan for Updates!‚Äù
The easiest way to update your motion ad? Build it with updates in mind from the start. Use modular designs, editable templates, and keep your files organized (seriously, name your layers properly‚Äîfuture you will thank you). This way, when it‚Äôs time for a refresh, you‚Äôre not starting from scratch, screaming at your software, or cursing past you for labeling everything as ‚ÄúLayer 1.‚Äù


---

üòÇ ‚ÄúFinal Thoughts: Ads Evolve, Just Like You!‚Äù
Your product evolves, your audience evolves, and guess what? Your motion design ad should, too. Updating it isn‚Äôt just about keeping it relevant‚Äîit‚Äôs about keeping your brand exciting, trustworthy, and on top of its game. So go ahead, give your ad a remix. Just promise me one thing: no Comic Sans.

# Demystifying the Java Burn Formula: A Blend for Boosting Metabolism

Java Burn boasts a proprietary formula meticulously crafted with a selection of natural ingredients. Each component plays a specific role in supporting your metabolism and assisting your weight management efforts. ¬†

**1. Green Tea Extract: A Powerhouse of Antioxidants and Metabolism Boosters**¬†

Green tea extract is a well-established champion in the wellness world, lauded for its abundance of antioxidants known as catechins. These potent catechins, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), have been linked to enhanced metabolic activity according to research published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Studies suggest they can increase calorie burning and promote fat oxidation, making them valuable allies in your weight loss journey. ¬†

**2. Chlorogenic Acid: Harnessing the Power of Coffee Beans for Weight Management**¬†

Chlorogenic acid is a naturally occurring compound found in green coffee beans. This unique element has garnered attention for its potential benefits in weight management. Research published in the journal Nutrients suggests chlorogenic acid may aid in regulating blood sugar levels and reducing carbohydrate absorption. This translates to potentially fewer cravings and a more balanced metabolism. ¬†

**3. L-Carnitine: Unleashing Your Body's Fat-Burning Potential**

L-carnitine is a naturally occurring amino acid that plays a crucial role in energy production within your cells. It facilitates the transportation of fatty acids into the mitochondria, the powerhouses of your cells, where they can be burned for fuel. Studies published in the journal Metabolism suggest L-Carnitine supplementation may enhance exercise performance and promote fat burning, particularly when combined with a healthy diet and exercise routine. ¬†

**4. Chromium: A Crucial Mineral for Blood Sugar Balance and Metabolism**¬†

Chromium is an essential trace mineral that plays a vital role in regulating blood sugar levels and insulin sensitivity. Research published in the journal Diabetes Care suggests chromium deficiency can lead to impaired insulin function and contribute to weight gain. By supporting healthy blood sugar levels, chromium may help curb cravings and promote a more balanced metabolism. ¬†

**5. L-Theanine: Promoting Focus and Balance**

L-theanine is an amino acid found predominantly in green tea. It's known for its calming and focus-enhancing properties. Studies published in the journal Nutritional Neuroscience suggest L-theanine may promote relaxation and mental clarity without inducing drowsiness. This can be particularly beneficial when managing stress-related cravings and maintaining a healthy mindset for weight management. ¬†

**6. Cayenne Pepper Extract: Spicing Up Your Metabolism with Capsaicin**¬†

Cayenne pepper extract is a potent source of capsaicin, a compound responsible for the characteristic heat of chili peppers. Research published in the American Journal of Physiology-Endocrinology and Metabolism suggests capsaicin can elevate body temperature, leading to a temporary increase in calorie burning. Additionally, capsaicin may contribute to feelings of satiety, potentially reducing overall calorie intake. ¬†

**7. MCT Oil: Fueling Your Body with a Clean-Burning Source of Energy**

MCT oil, or medium-chain triglycerides, is a type of fat that your body can readily absorb and utilize for energy. Studies published in the journal International Journal of Obesity suggest MCT oil may lead to increased satiety and potentially promote weight loss compared to other types of fat. Additionally, MCT oil may offer a readily available source of energy, supporting your activity levels. ¬†

**8. Vitamin D3: The Sunshine Vitamin Linked to Weight Management**

Vitamin D3 is essential for maintaining strong bones and a healthy immune system. However, research has also begun to explore its potential role in weight management. Studies published in the journal Obesity Reviews suggest vitamin D deficiency may be linked to increased body weight and difficulty losing weight. By ensuring adequate vitamin D levels, you may be supporting your body's natural weight management processes. ¬†

# Exploring Synergistic Effects: How Java Burn Ingredients Work Together

The magic of Java Burn lies in the synergistic interplay of its ingredients. Each element contributes its unique properties, while together they create a more comprehensive approach to weight management.

For instance, the combination of green tea extract, L-carnitine, and cayenne pepper extract may work together to enhance thermogenesis, the process of heat production in your body, potentially leading to increased calorie burning. Additionally, chromium and L-theanine may support healthy blood sugar levels, potentially reducing cravings and promoting a more balanced metabolism. ¬†

Furthermore, the inclusion of MCT oil and vitamin D3 can contribute to improved energy levels and overall well-being, both crucial factors in maintaining a healthy lifestyle for weight management.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about Java Burn Ingredients

**1. Are Java Burn Ingredients Safe?**

Java Burn is formulated with natural ingredients generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA. However, it's always recommended to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications. ¬†

**2. How Long Does it Take to See Results with Java Burn?** ¬†

My peace of mind vacillates between the local ‚Äì neighborhood, city, campus, county ‚Äì and the nonlocal, which is the nation, nature, the world, the solar mind and the alien other. I also have interpersonal things, but the interpersonal is vastly in service to those other venues these days, mainly because I don‚Äôt have a partner, lover, child or best friend. Some of that‚Äôs a choice, and some of it is a calling, which is a lovely word for negotiating past the sense of coercion that‚Äôs sometimes easy to feel when one‚Äôs labor is existentially unpaid, a common human late-stage-capitalism feeling, I bet. I was called to experience environmental consciousness and to explore these characteristics, and that‚Äôs what I do, pretty much every day.

I‚Äôve had a strange problem over the last month or so. The problem has to do with laundry and began when the Channing-Murray van broke down. The van was donated to us, and it has 120K plus miles, so I was never trying to rely on it, but then the alternator failed ‚Äì that‚Äôs my educated guess because the same failure struck my old car, and whatever caused it was so anomalous but purposeful that they repeatedly put a new alternator in it, tested it extensively by letting my car run all day, but then within a day of getting it back, the alternator would go out again, and I would have to get the car back over to the garage, new alternator installed, more testing, seems like it‚Äôs working, give it back, alternator fails ‚Äì happened three times. Ridiculously mysterious to the mechanics, and I pictured it emerging from some highly unlikely confluence of forces, precipitating some equally unlikely chain of events, that together could not be comprehended sufficiently by the industry to have precipitated a recall or some general guidance about diagnosing ‚Äò98 Hyundai Accent standard package freakin‚Äô alternators. I ended up giving them, like, $1200, which probably didn‚Äôt break even for them, in terms of parts and attention to the problem, and in return, I scrapped my car. This happened in, like, in summer 2016, I think, when I started borrowing your car now and then to go to the prison to run the resource room. So I had to ad-lib my way of getting around, as maybe you did sometimes.

So now I‚Äôm doing that again, but reorienting my world to be entirely the range by which I can walk ‚Äì I walk to the library, to the co-op, to the courthouse, both state and fed, and to the city buiding and the IMC. In the other direction, I may be headed to the Champaign City Building or the co-op hardware store. The coffee shops I used to go to in my late thirties, where I would just sit and write mainly, about politics and the hyperreal nature of reality ‚Äì they‚Äôre all closing or closed, and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs meant to be a kind of echo of my inner life, but I feel a peace of mind and my inquiry is quite a bit more shareable now than then. Then, I imagined my handwriting would form the basis for analysis equally literary and seismographic, assuming the hyperform was working through everything, a kind of deluge of communication occupying every phenomenology, exploring rarified pattern recognition based on anomalous movements of the tip of my pilot pen, which might form the basis for an entirely other narrative with a complexly different set of concerns. This is what it‚Äôs like to be an alien discovering something like the earthen biological matrix and its variations in individuation and selfhood.

The Pilot-brand pen ‚Äì what an achievement. The smooth barrel, the extra-fine diameter, an ink derived from octopuses. This is the only part I wish they‚Äôd change ‚Äì the part about using octopus ink as their secret sauce or whatever, I mean that stuff‚Äôs gonna rot, right? It‚Äôll look good on the page for a while, but then bacteria enter the scene, the microbiological finds a food source, shoots way up, lichen begin to grow across it eventually. Slime mold, that sort of thing. ¬†

So now we don‚Äôt have a van, and I‚Äôm walking everywhere on foot. I‚Äôll ask for a ride-share for a few errands, like going to the hardware store to stockpile rock salt ‚Äì zero chance I‚Äôm going to haul a 40 pound bag of rock salt across town, though I once carried two cases of Campbell‚Äôs vegetable soup across town to my grad dorm, where I secretly microwaved nothing but bowls of soup for all my meals, with crackers and potato chips ‚Äì like I wasn‚Äôt thinking it through ‚Äì at ‚Äì all ‚Äì and along with my coffee and prolific cigarette smoking, went into a blood pressure danger zone at the age of 22 years and more or less average weight. I felt somewhat unconscious at that time of my life, even as I was studying Plato and Dewey, reading feminist theory, attending an Andrea Dworkin lecture after studying her activist work in Minneapolis-St. Paul.

Campbell‚Äôs vegetable soup: fine intermittently.

I just created a one-hour articulation in which I distinguished between metaphysical hygiene and metaphysical literacy, discussed the penultimate modern technology of life-long learning algorithms in the context of conversational artificial intelligence, followed by the posthuman appearance of the transcendental object that will also signal an historic shift in our relationship to time. Along the way, humanity develops a new relationship to simultaneity based on certain notional technical breakthroughs that will remake the experience of nonlocality and discover new equivalencies with locality. These six characteristic phenomenologies ‚Äì (1) metaphysical hygiene, (2) metaphysical literacy, (3) AI, (4) life-long algorithms, (5) the transcendental object and (6) simultaneity ‚Äì constitute visible-behavioral manifestations of the posthuman, and they might easily appear and become ubiquitous in the next 50 years. I compared this to the post-agrarian appearance of the electric grid, water grid, sewer-sanitation grid, telegraph-information grid, street-mobility grid, and education-literacy grid. There are others, but these seem like the substance of the leap from one age of humanity to another, thanks to the self-limiting condition called modernity.

What I‚Äôm trying to imagine is what condition lays in wait for us over this next 50 years, which is usually the span of time we place on things having to do with climate change, which plays in the background like a crisis phenomenology that people get hooked on, count periods of the year with ‚Äì tornado season, hurricane season, wildfire season, a federal emergency, an etheric happening, zombie outbreaks, which we‚Äôve largely grown used to ‚Äì people write: sending hopes and prayers, and people in the general public now freely mock them for saying this, because it is so meaningless to make inane statements when the very act of paying attention is a source of sorrow ‚Äì a feeling I recognize as one of the great ones of my life ‚Äì when everyone is attuned to the same narrative, at the same time, all in a kind of self-reflective place where we wait for the news to keep trickling in from different sources ‚Äì about what‚Äôs going on, how we should feel about it.

I believe the most extraordinarily impactful thing the hyperform could do at this point in history is nothing ‚Äì for two or three generations, nothing ‚Äì let everything proceed as smoothly as possible, to let this next phase of humanity play out. In 50 years, if we really put our shoulder to the wheel now in terms of adoption of certain innovations, we could have a global population of posthuman intelligent forms to interact with numbering in the billions, this along with the billions of human lives that will still be in existence amidst all that influence from the flourishing posthuman intelligence. How long does it take for a lifelong learning algorithm to know you better than you know yourself? Does the relationship between human self-understanding and AI understanding of the self continuously waiver? Those who live these lives can expect to experience a heightened sense of meaning and purpose, a stronger relationship with transcendental experience that can be expressed as the alien other, speaking through the laws of nature, plus exceptions to same.

My great dilemma with the van‚Äôs alternator going out is how to get my laundry done ‚Äì there, I said it, and this torment has been on my mind for the better part of a month. I conceived of all kinds of plans, but none of them caught much traction, including the fact the bus doesn‚Äôt stop near the laundromat where I‚Äôve been doing my clothes for 25 years, which could fill me with a certain amount of melancholy, but really the laundromat is more like an arcade from my youth than anything else, and that‚Äôs a pleasant association for me. All those machines and quarters. If the washes and driers made bleepy and warpy sounds, it would complete the effect and appeal to people of my generation.

I imagined putting the laundry in a bike trailer, plus getting a bike to pull the trailer ‚Äì a solution that might be tricky to implement in January and February, but I would work it out. I thought about getting a wagon ‚Äì like a little red wagon to put my laundry basket in, then pull it casually to the library. I thought of strapping the laundry to a dolly, then wheel it before me like a piece of moldering luggage, me walking in the fumes the whole way. The solution that rose to the top was none of those things ‚Äì I decided to pull out my frame backpack, see how much dirty laundry I could cram into it, then strap it to my back, grab a bottle of eco-friendly laundry detergent, walk across town on an early Sunday morning, do laundry, march back. I could tell I would eventually become known for this ‚Äì oh, there‚Äôs that guy with the frame backpack, hiking to the laundromat and back. I would be wearing the worst clothes in my wardrobe each time this happened because those are the clothes I wear to the laundromat, frequently because they are nearly the only clothes I have left.

Then, earlier today, returning to the peace church after writing at length about the election, I hit upon exactly the solution that I needed to implement right away ‚Äì I would just take a five gallon bucket, fill it with warm water, and do the laundry myself. This was like a bolt from the blue, this realization that you don‚Äôt actually need a machine to do laundry, that the machine doesn‚Äôt produce any demonstrable advantage, neither the washer nor the drier, compared to letting clothes soak in silent soapy water, then wash them off, squeeze them out, pin them to a line or dry them on a rack. This works. It‚Äôs altogether better than going to a laundromat, saving quarters, letting a month‚Äôs worth of dirty clothes pile up.

So I got a bucket, washed a load of laundry with a hose and a mop handle, let it soak for 20 minutes, then squeezed it out, hung it along three lengths of twine strung between three nails I pounded into a rafter in the basement, tied the other end to the curtain rod in the shower, hung everything up to dry on hangers over a rough concrete floor. Where I am writing this, in the loft of the peace church, the clothes are line drying two stories directly below me. Some of the moisture might have conceivably seeped up to where I‚Äôm sitting, like invisible root hairs are lapping at the clothing, freshly laundered, drawing up the moisture like steeped tea.

I feel free for having thought of this, followed through, and then I think it might conceivably alter my life, this singular improvement, in that it takes me not half as long to now do a load of laundry, virtually for free. In turn, this means that wearing fresh clothing, day in and day out, will soon become the norm, a status upgrade I haven‚Äôt known in most of my adult life. I vow to take up showering twice per day, brush after each meal and snack, shave every other week to promote good will and general brio as my signature contributions to the environment. Green, I want you in green, says Lorca, which now forms a common back-and-forth among Spaniards when someone mentions the word green. Geen, someone says about something, to which some innocent bystander replies, I want you in green ‚Äì I read that in a forward. Lorca is part of the environment, self-organizes come-ons as idle chit-chat. Taking chit-chat to the next level, we might observe. In a forward is where I read that.

So the experiment is simmering below me, and I will soon go to sleep not far from here ‚Äì a kind of hermitage accreting around me with very little connection to the material world, and therefore, an acute love of what‚Äôs still there for me. I‚Äôve seen trees come and go. White pickup trucks portend a terrorist false flag operation, and the next day again. The woman I walk past who asks for change on my way across town for compostable leaf bags ‚Äì someone sitting on a crate where that woman sits on that crate and says, change! have a nice day! She doesn‚Äôt really pronounce change in the interrogative, though that‚Äôs the implication ‚Äì there‚Äôs a bucket. But she says it as an exclamation, like a prophetess exclaiming her reflections, her advocacy, like a mantra, hour after hour, a labor if ever there was one. I pass, and she‚Äôs someone else, though, and she says do you want some change? ‚Äì I mean that‚Äôs what she said, and I wondered if it was like a performance art thing or something, and then I realized something was implying today, or at least that moment, that place, was somehow inside out. I said, not today ‚Äì meaning I was fine with walking to get bundles of leaf bags. When new waves of these rich brown leaves speckle the landscape, they remind me of something alive, which is what they were, having fallen from the sky, which is where they were going, by way of autumn wind storm, branches tossed around like load of laundry.",1,1732686923.0,MetaphysicalWeather,0,1.0,False

I planned a 3 day fast initially but today is the 3rd day and I want to keep going because it feels like I can handle it. I don't feel very great,  but feel like I can still manage. The second reason is I weighed myself and it didn't seem to move at all so I didn't want this to be all for nothing and decided to extend it until at least I can see something. I have only taken like 2 cups of black coffee so far and am water fasting throughout.  I understand the scale does not represent the whole story, but I feel like somehow my body is retaining water?  Appearance wise my skin is not as tight as I would like it to be, like at the back of my calves, so I think maybe that's some water retention there? 

Stats: 25F, 5'4 height, 81 KG starting weight. (Started fasting on the 4th day of my period). Don't do keto.

2) I noticed in rolling 36s my skin looked really great but I am not seeing that this time. It doesn't look bad per se but I just expected it to be more brighter and clearer like it would get even on one 36 hour fast last year. Is it indicative of something going wrong?   
3) Should I refeed at the wedding and go back to fasting if I want to see some results before holidays or should I skip the food at the wedding as well and go as long as I can?

Of course women are there to do their shopping or work not to be romantically propositioned by a stranger

But I've decided I'm going to use the opportunity to meet women, for a few reasons

**Firstly, playing it safe never worked for me.** I've had countless women smile at me as we walk past each other only for me to keep on walking because I convinced myself that my approach wouldn't be appreciated. For all I know I could be years into a beautiful relationship with one of those women if only I had introduced myself. 

**Secondly, I'm a tall good looking guy, so women shouldn't be immediately turned off or creeped out by my appearance** (because lets face it a large part of whether a stranger's behavior is considered cute or creepy is determined purely by whether or not she finds him physically attractive) 

**Thirdly, I'm a respectful guy with good social skills -** I know some women have had encounters with disrespectful scum and stalkers that has left them permanently weary with strangers but I can intuit nonverbal cues and fuck off accordingly so at worst a woman I approach will feel uncomfortable for about 10 seconds. 

**Fourthly, a lot of women would surely appreciate being approached by a respectful, attractive man, even if they aren't single or  aren't interested in dating.** This is something I need to remind myself. My coworker was asked out by a customer she found cute and was glowing over it for the rest of the day even though she has a boyfriend. 

**Lastly, it's genuinely the best shot I have at meeting women.** I don't enjoy bars and clubs, my friends don't go out anymore, my hobbies are dominated by guys or they're solo, my work isn't an option, dating apps are full of time wasters and scammers and catfish these days so public approaching is probably the best chance I've got at meeting a woman I'm actually attracted to. It's also how my father met my mother and how my friend met his wife.

I have actually cold approached women before and briefly dated a few (that were nice but never progressed into a relationship)... 

My approach has been pretty direct.

Trying to think of something more contextual or witty is likely to make me overthink it and keep walking past because usually you only have about 20 seconds to think of something. 

The obvious downside to this approach though is that it can really put the woman on a spot to make a snap decision with a stranger, because you haven't built any rapport yet. Also, it doesn't allow me to gauge their response and figure out whether they're someone I even want to have a date with, so it can make me come across as a bit superficial and desperate. 

There is a playful approach I used once: 

 *'hey do you mind if I get a ladies advice on something?'* 

*'sure'*  

*'well I know we live in the age of online dating and judging people by their pixels but if I saw a cute girl with a friendly vibe do you think it's still worth introducing myself to her the old fashioned way?'* 

*'yeah for sure'*

*'In that case, my name is AnomicAge, lovely to meet you'* 

She said if she wasn't married she totally would have agreed to a date (I didn't even notice the ring on her finger) 

I once just asked a woman for her recommendations of venues or events for singles in their late 20s to meet, I think I said something like 'where did you meet your partner or where are you friends meeting guys these days?' which got us talking about dating, she said she was single and it was natural for me to ask her out, we ended up dating for a few months. This might not be the worst idea because it lets you know whether they're single and interested, if they are there is a natural segue into asking them out - if they aren't then you might get a bit more knowledge about where to meet people. 

Can you suggest any approaches that are direct but also allow me to build a bit of rapport in conversation before asking them out, especially generic ones which don't rely on something interesting going on around us?

I guess my question would be that if small businesses here in Australia like coffee shops etc did the same thing, but the only difference being you'd tap the short transaction reference number into your PayID, would this not totally sort the bullshit transaction fees that stack up?

Of course women are there to do their shopping or work not to be romantically propositioned by a stranger

But I've decided I'm going to use the opportunity to meet women, for a few reasons

**Firstly, playing it safe never worked for me.** I've had countless women smile at me as we walk past each other only for me to keep on walking because I convinced myself that my approach wouldn't be appreciated. For all I know I could be years into a beautiful relationship with one of those women if only I had introduced myself. 

**Secondly, I'm a tall good looking guy, so women shouldn't be immediately turned off or creeped out by my appearance** (because lets face it a large part of whether a stranger's behavior is considered cute or creepy is determined purely by whether or not she finds him physically attractive) 

**Thirdly, I'm a respectful guy with good social skills -** I know some women have had encounters with disrespectful scum and stalkers that has left them permanently weary with strangers but I can intuit nonverbal cues and fuck off accordingly so at worst a woman I approach will feel uncomfortable for about 10 seconds. 

**Fourthly, a lot of women would surely appreciate being approached by a respectful, attractive man, even if they aren't single or  aren't interested in dating.** This is something I need to remind myself. My coworker was asked out by a customer she found cute and was glowing over it for the rest of the day even though she has a boyfriend. 

**Lastly, it's genuinely the best shot I have at meeting women.** I don't enjoy bars and clubs, my friends don't go out anymore, my hobbies are dominated by guys or they're solo, my work isn't an option, dating apps are full of time wasters and scammers and catfish these days so public approaching is probably the best chance I've got at meeting a woman I'm actually attracted to. It's also how my father met my mother and how my friend met his wife.

I have actually cold approached women before and briefly dated a few (that were nice but never progressed into a relationship)... 

My approach has been pretty direct.

When I was five, my mother and I drove by a family selling chihuahuas in a parking lot. Me, being five, wanted one and my mother bought Marley. (I thought Marley and me was a happy movie at age 5, fucking foreshadowing). My parents were dysfunctional, abusive, and psychologically tortured me for the entirety of my childhood, and for 10 years the only friend i was allowed to have was my dog. She was there for me in the darkest times of my life when i thought i would never be happy or loved. I can positively say that she was the only being in this world that truly loved me until my adult life.

We were deep in poverty in Oklahoma. My mother sold substances to pay bills along with minimum wage jobs. As a 5 year old, I was tasked with taking care of every need my dog had. Whenever I forgot to take her out, and she peed, I would be berated, grounded, and told I was irresponsible. Because I failed to properly take care of her at the ages 5-7, for the rest of my time in their house (till 18) I was labeled as irresponsible. 

My parents fed her extremely cheap dog food, treats from the dollar tree, and would feed her ‚Äúdinner‚Äù of peas, white rice and a small amount of meat. She became obese around age 3. She had never been to the vet in her life besides her vaccinations when she was born, and before she died. 

My parents performed ‚Äúvet‚Äù care on her at home. While I was away for summer, she had a paw injury because according to my parents she got her foot stuck in the ground. They re-set her leg and when I came home they refused to tell me why she was bandaged and limping for weeks after. She never walked the same way again.

When she was 7, her teeth started rotting. Instead of taking her to a vet, my parents ripped her rotten teeth out while she was conscious. They also did this to our cat, Gizmo. Hearing her cry in pain was traumatizing and I begged for them to take her to vet when I found out they were going to do it. 

When I was 15, and after she turned 10, she started losing weight rapidly and drinking water for extended periods of time. I had a job and begged my parents to take her to the vet, and I would pay for it. My parents declined and said that she‚Äôs acting normal. Over the course of the next two months I watched my best friend die and I could do nothing about it. I was banned from leaving the house besides for work or school, like always. Her weight loss became so rapid that she went from 12 pounds to just under 4 when she passed. By the end of it, she was vomiting what looked like black coffee grounds and was urinating uncontrollably. I begged for weeks for them to do something, and they didn‚Äôt until the last possible moment. 

When they took her to the vet, they diagnosed her with 2 types of late stage pancreatitis and there was no possible treatment. We had to put her down that day and she was actively deteriorating every hour.

We took her home and in the car my mother told me that it was my fault she was dying. That I was lazy and messy, and she must‚Äôve licked a food wrapper and gotten diabetes from all the sugar I eat. That I neglected her and that‚Äôs why she was uncontrollably urinating. She was fed refined carbs for most meals of her life, and I was an extremely organized teenager who never left food scraps out because of the punishment I would face if I did. 

For the next two hours, at home, she was yelling at me while I held Marley‚Äôs nearly lifeless body. She told me that I was a murderer and she should have me jailed for animal abuse. My dog was barely conscious, but she still flinched when my mother raised her voice. 

When we took her back to be put down, I was uncontrollably crying- I never let go of her. I screamed in the room after she was gone. While it was happening, my mother said in the kindest voice I‚Äôve ever heard from her;
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault.‚Äù

I did not eat for a week after her death. I took her toys in my pocket to school to smell so I could keep her memory. The universe felt like it stopped, and like I no longer belonged without her. It was the lowest place I‚Äôve ever been in my life. 

When I could finally go a few hours without crying, which was a few weeks later, my mother approached me with the bill for her treatment. It was about 4k. She told me since I caused her death I should be made to pay for her labs, bloodwork, and cremation. 

I was fucking floored. I told her she said while it was happening that it wasn‚Äôt my fault.

She said: ‚ÄúI just said that so you would stop crying.‚Äù

All of my money was routed to her acct from my job anyways. I paid for her treatment on my minimum wage fast food job. And I don‚Äôt care about the money, and 5 years later I still feel the same way about her death. I still speak to my mother but I can‚Äôt help but entertain the idea of me being happy that she suffered. When she had a stroke when I was 17, I was indifferent and secretly hoped that she would just die. When she had gastric bypass, I prayed she would code. 

Now, as an adult, I have 3 cats that are overprotected. They have never missed an annual vet visit and I feed them diets that are healthy for them as obligate carnivores. I love them so much but they will never experience any suffering like Marley and Gizmo did. Gizmo is still alive, yet 20lbs, and I watch him time to time. When he passes away I will probably go no contact. 

I know she was wrong but I feel like I‚Äôll never be a good cat mom, or that I‚Äôll kill them. I have extreme health anxiety about them. If one of them randomly vomits I will spiral and convince myself it‚Äôs worth a vet visit when in reality they just ate too much at once and threw up. But I wanted to ask you guys how you get through imposter syndrome. I can‚Äôt get my dog back, but I haven‚Äôt been able to disconnect from the pain at all, even five years later.

I have spent my entire life in Namma Chennai, which is for 22 years. Ever since I got my admit from UB, I felt very proud about myself that I will be going to the US, get some international exposure, hangout with friends, etc. Deep down, I knew that I will be separated from my family, friends and this wonderful city. But, I was ready to face this anyway and was in fact very confident about all of this.

I turn out to be an above-average student, but I am capable of coming up with innovative project ideas. To be honest, I chose to go for a master's degree so that I can give myself some space to actually create something out of it. I really did not care about the impact that it could make, yet I had everything planned before flying to the US.

I flew to the US on August 13, 2024. But, the few weeks before this day were slowly breaking me down.

On July 23, my laptop hard disk gave up, which had all of my college memories and I was searching like a madman for cheap data recovery options but it all were so expensive with an average success rate. I finally decided to go to Ritchie Street, to check for cheaper options and didn't really think about the success rate of the data recovery. I come from South Chennai, and I traveled there in my grandfather's scooty. I remember each and every detail of that trip.

I went to Tambaram Railway Station, and realized that I will never come back here for that ‚Çπ10 so-called tea after returning from college.

I crossed the Chennai Airport and realized that this is where I am parting ways with this city.

I crossed Kathipara and realized that I will not see this vibrant flyover for the next few years.

I crossed YMCA and realized that me and my father will not participate in marathons together often anymore.

I crossed T.Nagar and realized that I will not come here to get filter coffee every time I travel between my home and Nungambakkam, where I used to go for study abroad counseling.

I crossed the US Consulate and realized that the next time I come here for a Visa Interview, I will go alone and my father will just wish me luck and not come with me.

I crossed Mount Road Bilal, realizing that me and my father will no longer come here for the 4am chai every time we come here for Sehri.

On my way back, I crossed Velachery and realized that my father will no longer take me to Phoenix Mall just to watch a random movie along with me, the moment he finds time.

I traveled through the entire Anna Salai and realized that I will not see myself, my dad and his RX100 till I come back. After this chain of nostalgic moments, I told myself to stop being melodramatic about all of this and in fact told myself that everything will be okay.

On July 28, I went to Kilpauk to send off one of my closest friends, who is also leaving to the US for his masters. My grandfather's scooty broke down on the Koyambedu bridge and luckily, I parked that scooty at my other friend's place, who was also joining me for the sendoff.

I took a metro from Thirumangalam to Kilpauk that day and guess what? The melodrama started again, and I ended up sobbing in the train like a lost kid. I still told myself that everything will be okay. A week before, I started getting extremely emotional about all of this and I have disturbed my parents' peace to an extent that I have never reached. Earlier, it was just me crying, but later, it became 3 people.

And then came August 13, me standing at Gate D7, a mentally disturbed human, hugging my family and sobbing, and my father said, ""You have never been this brave in your life as you are now"".

It's November 27 today, and I still haven't recovered from this series of emotional moments. I don't know how I have spent the last 15 weeks in this place. But one thing is for sure, not one day has passed since I have not thought of Chennai.

I miss going throughout the city in a two-wheeler in the scorching sun, just to feel vibrant and to realize that there is more to life than just sitting at home opposite to your laptop.

I miss taking the MTC buses and getting scowled by bus conductors for not bringing enough change with me.

I miss taking the local train to Chennai Beach whenever I feel like.

I miss my scooty that broke down the other day.

I miss my family and friends, who have always supported me.

I miss each and every moment of my childhood and adulthood that I have spent in this city.

I don't understand how I got to this place- this position where I am.
I hear lies about me and I know one person who is actively telling stories. 
There might be two--Because this person has a strong connection with someone much younger than themselves.

There's nothing I can do. Because I can't control or change other people.
I Can only focus on what is good and true and right and just etc.of good report and praise worthy.

it's hard to do that when every day is a war there is no peace and the battle  is other people wanting to destroy me ( the battle is with principakities and powers not of God) and I don't understand why me ? I'm not a great person.but  Haven't intentionally broken any laws. 
Yes, I have broken commandments, some unintentionally, but because of being careless and others because of stupidity.  I keep trying to battle, and quit bad habits.  I haven't tried to harm others intentionally.  I've tried to protect myself as I could, but I couldn't always. 
But apparently, I am being scapegoated for something. I don't know what it is, and I don't think I can ever go far enough away to escape my defects of character and doubt anyone will allow me to change.
Because someone always ends up hating me.
Where do we go? Those of us who had no choice when we were harmed? Where do we go? We couldn't stop them then and we can't stop them now because nobody believed us then or now-- And because of the way society is, it's doubtful anyone will believe us in the future--Meaning those of us who have been harmed and brought to the state of CPTSD.
And it is To be expected that most people believe those who are attractive and act like everyone else, Even if it's only on the surface .

Those of us who can't are sort of doomed, and if we're not attractive, it's even worse.

 I don't seem to be able to get the hang of acting like everyone else or how people want me to be, and I will never be attractive because of  cancer -- which did more than cause me to Have kind of a wretched alopecia, but the extra chemo didn't do any good for my skin or face or bones
And I am quite ugly.

I wish I knew what to do next, but I don't.

There was a man who was a retired therapist who came to my home and refused to meet with me outside my home when I didn't want to meet with him alone anymore. He would not even let me buy him a cup of coffee. Because he said I will need every penny to take care of myself.

He refused my hospitality--But he is also a priest of the lutheran church. Married To a beautiful and intelligent and gifted woman.  At some point, I didn't want to meet with him alone in my home anymore.

He was unwavering in his harshness and yet he did help me get out of the house and try to move forward with my life, but became harsh snd strict. used NLP. It didn't feel right, and he silenced my voice.

I have lost everything and I don't know what my home status is going to be.

It felt like community mobbing for a very long time. I didn't realize it might've been the church coming after me or the church who wanted to be gone until people that I had always trusted on that mocking tone in their voice.

So those of us who were pretty much doomed because of things we could not control are then punished for our lifetimes- even when maybe we only have another 10 or 15 years

Whoever wants to punish us will take those years.

I don't know who wants to punish me except for this man from a church That I used to attend. once the pastor i knew and liked -- even used to ask me how I liked his sermons and were they too didactic, etc. 
And he invited me to teach and sing and do programs.
I had not had that experience since the church in which I grew up--And once he left the church Started to hire people who used to be in business and everything sort of went downhill and became very corporate.
I don't know what that has to do with today, but there's definitely a connection between the church and the man who visited me on a regular basis to help me. I believed until things went wrong and I didn't believe it anymore.

**Lastly, it's genuinely the best shot I have at meeting women.** I don't enjoy bars and clubs, my friends don't go out anymore, my hobbies are dominated by guys or they're solo, my work isn't an option, dating apps are full of time wasters and scammers and catfish now so daytime approaching is probably the best chance I've got at meeting a woman I'm actually attracted to. It's also how my father met my mother and how my friend met his wife.

I have actually cold approached women before and briefly dated a few (that were nice but never progressed into a relationship)

My approach has been pretty direct.

Wait for them to smile or at least visually acknowledge me without turning away or appearing to be in a rush, then walk up and say something like

*'hey, this is a long shot but lifes short and you're incredibly cute with a friendly vibe so if somehow you're single and you're interested I would love to take you out and get to know you over a coffee or a cocktail sometime'*

It's very direct, but unless there's some natural conversation starter in our situation/environment then I think all up it's the best approach - it seems bold, confident, you're not wasting anyone's time...beating around the bush didn't exactly work well for me when I tried it, especially if they're in a bit of a hurry. Trying to ask them questions about themselves and have a long conversation can seem a bit inappropriate if you're not in the right environment too.

In fact I feel like being indirect can be creepier - it's usually pretty obvious why a guy has struck up a conversation with a woman in public, and if it isn't to ask her out then it's usually to recruit her to some MLM or cult. I once had a cute woman walk up to me and started making friendly albeit idle chat, I soon began to wonder what her angle might be... sure enough she invited me to a movie night at the church of Jesus Christ of the latter day saints.

Trying to think of something more contextual or witty is likely to make me overthink it and keep walking past because usually you only have about 20 seconds to think of something.

The obvious downside to this approach though is that it can really put the woman on a spot to make a snap decision with a stranger, because you haven't built any rapport yet. Also, it doesn't allow me to gauge their response and figure out whether they're someone I even want to have a date with, so it can make me come across as a bit superficial and desperate.

There is a playful approach I used once:

*'hey do you mind if I get a ladies advice on something?'*

*'sure'*

*'well I know we live in the age of online dating and judging people by their pixels but if I saw a cute girl with a friendly vibe do you think it's still worth introducing myself to her the old fashioned way?'*

*'yeah for sure'*

*'In that case, my name is AnomicAge, lovely to meet you'*

She said if she wasn't married she totally would have agreed to a date (I didn't even notice the ring on her finger)

I once just asked a woman for her recommendations of venues or events for singles in their late 20s to meet, I think I said something like 'where did you meet your partner or where are you friends meeting guys these days?' which got us talking about dating, she said she was single and it was natural for me to ask her out, we ended up dating for a few months. This might not be the worst idea because it lets you know whether they're single and interested, if they are there is a natural segue into asking them out - if they aren't then you might get a bit more knowledge about where to meet people.

Can you suggest any approaches that are direct but also allow me to build a bit of rapport in conversation before asking them out, especially generic ones which don't rely on something interesting going on around us?

i always use all of what i have, and dont let things go to waste, yet find myself spending between $150-250 a month. 

i buy the staples like rice, pastas, etc in bulk (which lasts a couple months) so the only thing i buy weekly is the meat and produce so it doesnt go bad. 

i meal prep and usually do 1-2 main meals per day, along with a canned soup or salad. i do not get/drink coffees, teas, sodas, etc. i got a water subscription because it ends up being cheaper than bottles or gallons and the tap water in my city isnt something id trust. 

am i spending too much? if i am, what ways can i reduce food costs without sacrificing quality food. i live in the NYC-NJ region so costs are pretty high right now.

So my gf and I are gonna be starting this game soon, and I read somewhere about breeding to slowly raise the max heart capacity of your animals. But I had two questions...

1. What's the efficient way to go about this? Do I just keep breeding each continual offspring until they hit 10-hearts, then just slowly sell off the lower capped ones as I replace them with 10s over time? And I assume even once I get a 10, only a 9 or 10 will make more 10s, yeah? Or will they ALL be 10s from that point on?

2. Once I get, say... a 10-heart normal cow. Will every other cow I BUY also be a 10? Or do I have to do something specific with my coffee cow, for example, to also make it a 10? Do I need to breed them too?

Lunch is the wildcard though I‚Äôve moved to eating 2 cans of tuna, with light mayo and wheat thins.

I prep dinner from stealth health cook book and some others to try to keep it under 800 and high in protein.

I try to keep snacking to a minimum and unless we go out to eat on a Saturday, I keep my soda diet.

Thoughts And Plans Moving Forward.,"I was sober for almost 80 days surviving a wedding without drinking and the desire to drink. I ruined that one Sunday afternoon thinking that I could just drink a six pack and not want more. Two days later I was a wreck. I knew I made a mistake and that I needed to stop

Day 1: No hangover but I had all the trademarks of anxiety and shakiness in my body. I didn't want to be anywhere besides my bedroom. I closed my mail app on my laptop and silenced my phone. I didn't want to talk to anyone. I was getting paranoid about every little thing. Time was passing painfully slow. I had no hunger and only just drank water and iced tea with lemon juice. If I had to go to the bathroom my toilet would look like a Jackson Pollock painting. I couldn't sleep at all. Maybe an hour at the longest and just stayed awake for the rest of the night.

Day 2: Less anxiety but still consistent. The shakiness went down as well. My bowels were still like before. I started to feel hungry again but was unable to really eat. Just kept drinking water and tea. Still didn't want to leave my room or talk to anyone. No regular bowel movements and still insomnia.

Day 3: Most of the physical shakiness is gone. I started to eat small amounts of food. Cravings for sugar came back. My anxiety and paranoia have decreased.

Day 4 - Today: Regular bowel movements and deep sleep are back. Regular appetite came back. Started drinking coffee again on Day 5. Sort of want to go do other things but still feel like insulating myself at home.

Things I have to do moving forward:

1. Stay sober obviously

2. Find a new job and rebuild my finances

3. Restart a hobby I did before drinking took control

4. Make new friends. Drinking made me self-isolate, and I gradually lost my friends. 

5. After all of that find a girlfriend.

I feel like this is more than just getting sober but starting a new life and being sober will make the rest happen. I just have to keep reminding myself of that. It will take time, and it won't be easy, but it will be totally worth it.

Export market research is the cornerstone of any successful international trade strategy. It involves gathering and analyzing information about target markets, demand trends, competition, and trade dynamics to make informed decisions. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to conduct effective export market research:

# 1. Identifying Target Markets and Their Potential

# Steps to Identify Target Markets:

1. **Understand Your Product**:
   * Determine the unique features, quality standards, and certifications of your product.
   * Assess how your product compares to competitors‚Äô offerings.
2. **Research Market Demand**:
   * Identify regions where your product is in demand.
   * Analyze consumption patterns, cultural preferences, and industry trends.
   * Example: Spices are in high demand in the Middle East due to culinary traditions.
3. **Evaluate Import Statistics**:
   * Study import data to determine which countries import large quantities of your product.
   * Example: The U.S. and EU are significant importers of textiles and apparel.
4. **Consider Market Accessibility**:
   * Assess trade agreements and tariffs that might make a market more or less accessible.
   * Example: India's CEPA with UAE reduces trade barriers for Indian exporters.
5. **Analyze Competitor Presence**:
   * Identify competing countries or companies exporting similar products.
   * Example: China‚Äôs dominance in electronics and its impact on Indian exporters.

# Key Metrics for Market Potential:

* **Market Size**: Volume and value of imports for your product.
* **Growth Trends**: Year-on-year growth in import demand.
* **Market Entry Barriers**: Tariffs, regulations, and logistical challenges.
* **Cultural Fit**: How well your product aligns with local preferences.

# Example of Target Market Analysis:

For a pharmaceutical exporter, the U.S., EU, and African markets present significant potential due to:

* High healthcare spending in the U.S. and EU.
* Rising demand for affordable medicines in Africa.

# 2. Analyzing Global Demand and Supply Trends

Understanding global demand and supply trends is critical for identifying lucrative opportunities and anticipating market shifts.

# Steps to Analyze Demand Trends:

1. **Track Import-Export Data**:
   * Identify leading importers and exporters of your product.
   * Example: India‚Äôs rice exports are driven by demand from the Middle East and Africa.
2. **Study Regional Trends**:
   * Examine how local economies, cultural practices, and demographics influence demand.
   * Example: Organic products are increasingly popular in Europe due to environmental awareness.
3. **Monitor Emerging Markets**:
   * Look for markets with growing economies and expanding middle classes.
   * Example: Southeast Asia is witnessing rising demand for processed foods and beverages.

# Steps to Analyze Supply Trends:

1. **Understand Competitor Strategies**:
   * Assess pricing, product quality, and marketing efforts of key competitors.
   * Example: Vietnam‚Äôs competitive pricing in coffee exports challenges Indian producers.
2. **Evaluate Supply Gaps**:
   * Identify underserved markets or niches where competition is low.
   * Example: The African market offers opportunities for Indian automobile components due to a lack of local manufacturers.
3. **Stay Updated on Global Events**:
   * Monitor geopolitical changes, trade agreements, and disruptions (e.g., the Russia-Ukraine conflict affecting wheat supply).

# Key Insights from Trend Analysis:

* Align your product offerings with regions experiencing demand surges.
* Prepare for competition by differentiating your product through quality or pricing.

# 3. Tools for Market Research

Several tools and platforms provide valuable data to support export market research. Below are some of the most effective ones:

# a. UN Comtrade (United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database)

* **What It Offers**:
   * Comprehensive trade data for over 200 countries.
   * Import/export statistics by product (HS code), value, and volume.
   * Insights into trade flows between countries.
* **How to Use**:
   1. Search for your product by HS code or keyword.
   2. Analyze data to identify top importing/exporting countries.
   3. Use historical trends to forecast future demand.
* **Example**:
   * Analyzing India's exports of spices reveals major importers like the UAE, U.S., and Germany.

# b. ITC Trade Map (International Trade Centre)

* **What It Offers**:
   * Detailed market analysis reports.
   * Trade performance indicators for countries and products.
   * Tariff information for specific markets.
* **How to Use**:
   1. Search for a product to view its global trade performance.
   2. Identify key markets based on import values and growth rates.
   3. Assess tariff structures and identify markets with low entry barriers.
* **Example**:
   * ITC Trade Map can show that African countries import significant quantities of affordable generic medicines, indicating opportunities for Indian exporters.

# c. World Bank Open Data

* **What It Offers**:
   * Economic and demographic data for countries worldwide.
   * Indicators like GDP, income levels, and population trends.
* **How to Use**:
   1. Identify markets with strong economic growth.
   2. Evaluate the purchasing power and market size.
   3. Match product offerings to income levels and preferences.
* **Example**:
   * An exporter of luxury goods might focus on high-income countries based on GDP per capita data.

# d. National Export Promotion Portals

* **Examples**:
   * **India**: Export Promotion Councils (e.g., APEDA for agriculture, SEPC for services).
   * **U.S.**: [Export.gov](http://Export.gov) for industry-specific market reports.
   * **EU**: Market Access Database for trade barriers and statistics.

# e. Additional Tools:

* **Google Trends**: Analyze online interest in specific products by region.
* **Statista**: Access global industry reports and statistics.
* **Chambers of Commerce**: Regional data on trade opportunities and business practices.

# Conclusion

Export market research is an essential step in identifying profitable opportunities, minimizing risks, and developing successful export strategies. By analyzing target markets, understanding demand and supply trends, and utilizing tools like UN Comtrade and ITC Trade Map, businesses can position themselves effectively in the global marketplace.",1,1732683891.0,IndianExporters,1,1.0,False

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/Q06pN42Bur): **May 10, 2024**

I (41M) have two kids with my ex wife, (42F) a son John(22) and daughter Sally (20), I'm remarried to my wife (28). I'm very close with my kids, my son is engaged to Abbie, she seems nice but has been a bit pushy trying to create relationships with me and my wife, though she's also awkward with her. Abbie isn't close to her family, she told us many stories why and while some of her complaints don't seem awful, it's not my place to judge and I didn't live it so I can't know anyway.

We've tried to be welcoming but Abbie has forced her way into some family traditions where she wouldn't have been invited, and some where no one outside of specific family would have. She has been calling Sally ""sis"" since they were only dating a few months, has an odd sister/mother-in-law thing she does with my wife, and the one I'm not a fan of, wants me to be like father to her. Not because we've clicked or anything. We are very different people, not saying that in a bad way, just saying it's not based on how we get along or anything.

My kids and I have a tradition when they come over that we have a private catch-up in my office/study before they leave, which is now even more important to them because while they both get along well with my wife they don't want to have personal conversations around her yet. Abbie asked if we could talk, and after I explained the tradition John later asked that I do it, saying she'd never had a caring conversation with her dad. 

We compromised that I didn't include her in the tradition but do join the two of them for coffee and let her talk. Then she started calling me dad, they werent even engaged yet, John pulled me aside and begged me to give her that, laid this whole thing on me about me always being the dad she always wanted right in front of her and she just wanted that, told me she cried watching me and Sally together (she still gives me random hugs, I'm a lucky dad). I didn't like it but I do feel bad so fine I gave her that. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and the father/daughter dance. I don't want to walk her down, and I walk with a cane so dancing is hard. At my own wedding I only danced twice. John is begging for me to do one, preferably the aisle.

They came over Sunday, John and I were talking, I thought to address it, when Ab walked in without knocking, asking if he'd told me yet. I asked what, John said she wanted me to say something about having a second daughter now in my speech and how I loved her. I just looked at him. She asked if I'd do the walk and dance for Sally, I said of course. She yelled she's my daughter too and I said it will never be the same, Sally is my actual daughter. I tried to explain I'd talk about her being a happy addition to the family and I love how happy she makes Jack, which i thought was a good compromise, but she started crying. John apologized and they left, but he called me when they were home nearly begging me to. AITA because I won't lie and say I love her or she's my daughter.

**Verdict: Not the Asshole**

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/cU032DTxqi): **June 26, 2024 (1.5 months later)**

I had planned on writing this sooner but life got in the way in a couple of really good ways, but people were helpful and asked for updates, and I have a surprise free day, so here it goes:

Mother's Day my kids and their partners go to visit my ex wife. So it turns out my ex wife and Abbie are a lot closer than I realized. She calls her mom, which is part of where this comes from. Also apparently my ex has been egging it on. On mother's day they were talking about the wedding and I guess whenever Abbie referred to me it was as dad. My son apparently told her let it go, which led to yelling. 

Abbie about deserving to be my daughter, ex telling her that she's right, son telling her that I am trying and she should be realistic about things, Sally telling her I only had one daughter - which was apparently a response to Abbie saying to her that as my ""daughters"" they should be united. according to my son Abbi was crying, according to Sally she was crying ang yelling and kicked something before going to her room, and Sally told me she went off on her mom, but will not elaborate so I don't know what was actually said. But knowing Sally - whoo boy.

Around 2am I got a text from Sally's partner's phone saying ""Abbie really is great, she hasn't been perfect but you should give her a chance and you will learn to love her."" I saw it when I woke up I tried to text her back but was blocked, so I called Sally but they were driving. They stopped by my place later that day because I am on the way and my daughter prefers my liquor and cooking and they told me about the night before. 

At the end I asked to speak to her partner alone, I asked if I had done something to upset her. She was confused and I told her I was blocked. She said I wasn't but checked her phone and I was, and I said it was after her message and she asked what message. I showed her, it was not on her phone anymore. At that point we brought in Sally and caught her up, neither of them were happy.

A couple of days later John and Abbie dropped by unannounced; not something we really do in this family but ok fine, I had mad salmon, does not take long to cook. I cook 2 more, wife serves while I make drinks. The entire night was Abbie trying to bring up the wedding, John trying to change the subject, Abbie not allowing that. 

We talk logistics because I am helping them get some good deals through some professional contacts I have when finally she just says ""so I was talking to mom, she said that you can walk me down the aisle and she'll do the dance, or you can dance and she'll walk, it's your call but you need to choose soon."" 

I reiterated that I could not dance (she tried arguing that I had danced a little at my wedding but I made it clear that is different) and did not feel comfortable walking her. She got upset and said ""mom loves me why can't you?"" I felt bad but couldn't lie, I pointed out that she had John who loved her, my exwife, friends, she had people who love her. She said ""but other than (ex-wife) those aren't my parents"" I said ""neither am I."" She was very emotional so my wife and I gave them a few minutes.

My son and I were alone later, he looked exhausted. He said the problem was that after Mother's day Abbie had called Sally and kept saying they are both my daughters, that I did not get to be close with one but not both, and that it was them against me - but at that one Sally cried havoc and let slip the dogs of war. Things were said. Grievances were aired. John had to hang up before it got worse, but I guess Abbie was shaken but there was a new problem; Abbie had decided in her head that I did not mean what I have been saying and was just doing it for Sally. He told me he would handle it.

Ron Howard: He did not

So now I get text messages from Abbie every couple of days acting like we have a secret relationship Sally doesn't know about, she even called herself my secret daughter and lol'ed. She invited my wife to lunch saying ""2 out of 3 of his girl's"" going out. She has even started using the pressure of showing up at events like a recent barbecue to play a certain image. She hugs me more and holds it, wants to do pictures with just me or my wife and I but always a few with just me to post with captions I do not like. 

My wife is getting especially annoyed because of how she is with her (I guess Abbie surprised her with father's day plans for me that had to be shut down, as it is she still inserted herself into the day) but she has a soft spot for her and when Abbie gets emotional she caves; my wife is a sweetheart.

I asked him if he is upset with me and he said no, he just wished it was different. He said we're good, but he's worried he and Sally aren't, which is when I took the advice of some people and suggested pre marital counseling, he said he would talk about it. Abbie is insisting Sally go to her fitting. 

That shop should pay-per-view that potential royal rumble because Sally is not holding her feelings back anymore. I told him Sally loves him and I'll talk to her, but for now it is stressful all around. Abbie driving my wife crazy with her ideas for what my ""girls"" should be doing, driving me crazy with dad-daughter content, drove sally to the edge, and oh yeah, last night sent me an email with 3 styles of father-daughter dances and song options, so i'm not feeling any more respected or heard than before. 

The six of us have barely been in the same room in order to let things calm down since father's day, which was great until it was a shit show. Sorry this is so long, with all the craziness this is still the abridged version. We are supposed to meet Friday, Sally's partner and I have a bet going about how bad it will go. So onward and upward, I hope you fathers had a less dramatic day than I did, and by any chance does anyone know exactly how bad of a crime I need to commit to enter witness protection? Just curious

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/vY1O52Txmv): **October 2, 2024 (3.5 months later)**

I have gotten requests for updates on my situation, and as I enjoy a refreshing mojito and my wife her nojito, life feels good and the perfect time to amuse the world with my pain and familial drama! Plus a cousin of mine who apparently reads these and knows my situation gave me the convincing argument of ""dude, you can't keep people hanging"" and how can I argue with that airtight argument. I apologize for how long this is, a lot has happened.

My wife's pregnancy is going well, keeping her as stress-free and pampered as possible has been my focus. It is such a different experience this time, both because of how much more involved I can be and how much better a relationship I have with my wife than I had with my ex. My daughter Sally has been great, even her partner has been great, helping with the nursery or driving her around when I can't. My wife doesn't know because it is a surprise, but my son has been building a crib for the baby, modeled after the one I built for him and his sister, to show my wife his support. My son is a good man, and he is still in there, he just has a soft spot for Abbie. Which I guess gets us to the part of the movie where Godzilla shows up and starts busting up buildings...

So I called a family meeting with my kids to talk about the situation. Told John his sister was only doing wedding activities she wanted to and that the guilting requests needed to stop, that this was hurting his relationship with his sister. Sally was happy I said it so she did not have to yet again. I told him if he did not stop her from messaging me I would block her with a bluntly honest explanation why. We got a lot out, John seemed to understand but then a few days later they insisted on coming to talk. Sally and I decided we would get everything out. 

So all of us ate at our place, Abbie started in immediately about baby shower stuff and I told that is the kind of thing we wanted to talk about. I told her that I understood she has been trying to fill a hole that she has, that she thought she was getting a father, a second mother (she calls my ex-wife mom apparently) and a sister. I told her it was still possible but that she needed to start listening to us. I told her that for the sake of family we would give her a fresh start, if she agreed that moving forward she would respect our boundaries. My daughter did not love this idea but loves her brother and was willing to try. 

Abbie tried to say that since we were starting over we could define what the relationship would be and just be family, we told her we were not ready for that, that it needs to happen organically. She got mad that I am closer with my daughter's partner, which is true but we just get along, and that she deserved it for trying so hard. My daughter said something about trying things we actually want. She ran to our bathroom, he ran after her. After a while I checked on him, I could hear her repeating ""this is not what I wanted."" My wife, daughter, and her partner went out to the patio to give them privacy and salvage the night, after a bit I got a text saying they had just left.

I checked in with him the next day and he said they talked more at home and she understood. For a couple of weeks things were good. The texts stopped except the occasional wedding question, since it was getting closer. She stopped pushing herself on my wife and Sally, and we thought was involving us in less in wedding planning out of respect, since as it was they only got the venue at the rate they did because of my professional connections and they know I was willing to help but not interested in helping plan, even if I am good at event-planning. 

But then I got a call from the venue telling me the card I used had been declined. Now this is a specific card I use for big purchases because of the miles so I knew it had a high limit. That was how I learned that they had changed dates by two months despite being informed I would still be out much of the money because it was too close to the date. I was furious, I mean I have been lucky in life financially but I am not blow-off deposits like nothing wealthy. Called my son, said he needed to get his ass to the house, just him. They both came.

When they arrived I opened the door, she actually started with, ""Dad!"" I think I just replied ""you have got to be f'n kidding me"" and walked toward the table. Abbie had the nerve to ask where dinner was, my response was not polite as I made it clear that was not why they were here. I hoped my son would not lie to me so I asked what was going on with the venue. She started going into wedding details but my son interrupted to tell me they postponed because my ex-wife was unavailable because of a surgery and he had not told me because he was putting money together to pay the lost money himself, and he had just reached out to guests to let them know. And that is when Abbie's mouth opened...""we have extra time to work on our dance...""

Now during this time my wife came home, and i was walking her toward the bedroom when Abbie said that. My pregnant wife with me I said, calmly, ""I have different feelings about that and will elaborate further shortly"" or something like that. Then I laid my wife down and got her water, turned on her symphonic covers of popular songs and walked back to the table and said something like ""You are out of your f'n mind have you even been listening?!"" I made it clear I was done with this nonsense, we all were, and kind of lost it asking she did not hear us last time because her head was up her ass. She was stunned silent (what a beautiful sound) and looked at me while I, admittedly with little filter, explained what Sally and I thought of our time with her and her attempts to force us to love her without even getting to know us. She started crying and stood up and shouted ""then what was this even for?!"" 

John asked what she meant, if she meant them and he started to freak out. She was frantic and said she meant delaying the wedding. Because, and I'm pouring another drink to write this, it was a ploy! My ex-wife and her decided if I HAD MORE TIME I would come around. Apparently my ex told her not to worry about the money because ""I am loaded."" She has always been bitter I make so much more than I did when we were married, as if that is out of spite rather than my career arc. I think she did that on purpose, frankly.

But she not only told me that lie, she and my ex told John as well. He was distraught. Repeating ""you lied to me"" as she tried to spin it but he was letting it out about how much he has defended her and covered for her and she lied to him too. She was defensive and blamed my ex for telling her things and me for being stubborn, she yelled ""why can't I just f'n call him dad"" and, finally, after so long, I heard John respond ""because he is not your f'n dad!"" She started crying and something about his being the one that told she could call me that and he said he told her she might be able to eventually but he had told her again and again to slow down. She started sobbing and went to sit on her chair but missed and fell on the floor. Appreciating physical humor to break the tension I admittedly chuckled and hid my mouth behind my drink, this all led to a lot of sobbing. I said I needed to check on my wife and as I walked out she was repeating ""I just want him to be my dad too.""

I came out and he was walking her to the door and apologized, I said not too, they left. He came over a few days later and said they had a long talk at home, he even asked her if she would have dated him if there was never a chance of being in the family. He believed her when she said yes but she admitted I was a big draw as well. I was the kind of dad she always wanted, my relationship with Sally is what she always wanted, and the way she said it gave John doubts that she loves him for him. I talked about marriage counseling, how his mother and I tried it and, while it did not save us, it provided clarity and an impartial voice. I pointed out they both like coming to me, but I cannot be impartial and if they are trying then they need to do it for real.

Abbie texted asking if I was the one who suggested therapy, I responded with ""does it matter if John wants to?"" She asked why it is so bad she wants to know what I think and I just said john is the man whose opinion should matter most to her. They fought due to the text, she agreed to the counseling and the wedding has been postponed!! I may have done a dance. So they are in counseling, he said she struggles but I obviously do not know details. She is pressing for me and Sally to go to a session with her, Sally told her she did not want to hear Sally unfiltered, and I am not interested. Abbie has been leaving Sally alone, she stopped texting me except for the occasional general question which include some attempt to go deeper. My wife still occasionally spends time with her because she is very into her pregnancy, more so than I like but it is my wife's call. So that is where we are, sorry it was so long but alcohol makes for a poor editor.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/u/GreatestThrow-man/s/duDEjbeuXu): **November 20, 2024 (1.5 months later)**

I was told I should do updates here, people have been asking me to, and to get into what went down on father's day and at their mother's house, I have been extremely busy these last few months but am enjoying my temporary unemployment and thought of this account because of recent thanksgiving drama. I will do a an update and then will share what happened earlier. Oh, and to whomever made the joke that Abbie finally got me to dance, that made me laugh, I shared that with the family.

My time has been largely caring for my wife, I tend to dote, I know. We are having a boy! We are really excited, though neither of us really had gender preference. I have raised both and both experiences were wonderful. Now we are discussing names, who we are going to honor. I thought everything had been quiet, but recently found my wife crying and found out I was wrong. Given how busy I have been with work, and my wife knowing I would be free again once we got into this month, my wife has kept this to herself. Apparently Abbie has been pushing for one thanksgiving this year. Things have been quiet with Abbie, my son said the wedding blowing up woke her up, and that therapy had been helping. But then this.

My understanding is that while John has been talking less with his mother because of all that happened, Abbie did the opposite. From my wife's telling, Abbie dropped by one day with my ex wife. My wife intensely dislikes my ex wife because of lies she spread about my first marriage ending due to infidelity with her, despite their being no infidelity and the linear nature of time making it impossible for us to have slept together back then. Before anyone asks, my ex wife does not actually think there was infidelity, I would get into that, but I am sure I would sound biased.

Anyway so my wife looked at our camera app, saw who it was and called my daughter; apparently the two of them were keeping things from me because I was working 18 hour days and they did not want me dealing with anything else. I wish they had not done that, but I appreciate the thought. I am really lucky to have such caring people around me. My daughter called her mom and said something that made them leave in a hurry, she will not tell me what but she smiles when I ask. I called John but he was dealing with somehard work news, so I just was there for him and left the other alone. 

The next day Abbie came back, alone this time. My wife saw it was her and asked her what she wanted through the door, Abbie said to apologize. My wife let her in (she is too nice) and after a nice talk Abbie asked about the whole family getting together for thanksgiving, my wife said of course, she assumed as much. 

A couple of days later in our groupchat we were discussing details, who brings what, and Abbie asks what else is needed. I say John already committed and she asked what about my ex wife, what should she bring. In the time I have known Abbie she has never made an intentional joke that funny, so I asked what she was talking about and she mentioned the ""whole family"" comment, and my daughter and I both asked what made her think we counted her as family?? She actually replied ""she is my family. i don't have a dad who wants me, just a mom and my mom deserves to be with family on thanksgiving"" 

Sally replied ""well we'll miss you and John then."" Abbie asks how she can say that, Sally asks how she can be so stupid, John says not to call her stupid and I say that is fair but there is no real way she thought my wife thought she meant my ex wife(at this point my wife had filled me in). And then...this is so stupid...she uses my son's phone to add my ex frigging wife to the group chat. She then thanks us for the invitation and asks what she can bring! As I was typing my daughter beats me to it and asks what she thinks she is doing, she knows she is not welcome- but says it less politely. My wife types ""you could not have thought she was included when I said family."" Abbie responded that she was not coming as my family but as hers.

Sally let her mom have it, she already is not talking to her much and said if my exwife is there then she is not. I mentioned there was never a chance ex was going to come and said I understand Abbie and John wanting to go to their mom's house so she is not alone. John typed ""plans not definite, will let you know"" He has since told me that he is not going to go to his mom's place but wanted to tell Abbie alone first. All I can think about is the comment about not having a dad who wants her, because it means she is still thinking about me as a dad, I believe. Just a negligent one. I mentioned that to my son and he said he noticed it to and had brought it up at therapy, because family is such a frequent topic, though I obviously do not know details.

Wow I thought this would be brief but that was a lot, I will get into the crazy stories later if there are people seeing this who want me to. I do not know how posting from here works in terms of anyone seeing it, but this has been good to get out.

**Commenter 1:** Someone needs to explain sunk cost fallacy to John. I genuinely cannot believe he is still with her after the sheer volume of times she has disrespected him, his boundaries, and your family. Maybe this was back in an earlier post but has anyone really taken the time to reason with him that there are other women out there and he deserves so much better than this kind of relationship?

> **OOP:** I had a talk when this started, so did his sister. After the blowup with the wedding his sister and I took him out for a game and some time to really talk after, that was when he apparently demanded counseling. I am happy that for now marriage is on hold, at least. He is seeing her a bit more honestly, but is still too optimistic, in my view.

**OOP needs to let his wife know not to let Abbie in when he is not home.**

> **OOP:** I have asked my wife to never let her in if I am not here after last time. Well, actually I had already asked her, but after the last incident my wife has agreed.

+

> You are exactly correct that she takes advantage of my wife's kindness, though once our boy is here I think she will be very protective and will hold strong. I have told John that Abbie will not be holding our baby, at least for the foreseeable future.

**OOP and his daughter need to have a serious talk with his son about Abbie**

> **OOP:** His sister and I had a serious conversation with him a little after everything blew up, it seems to be what inspired both his demand for counseling and putting the marriage on hold. He is better about seeing her honestly, his sister said something about Abbie having similarities to their mother, which would have been fighting words from anyone else (and I saw the temper that rarely comes out) but then he listened because she clearly put thought into it. I never thought about it, I am proud to have kids smarter than me (I know my boy don't come off a genius in these posts, and fsir enough in that dept., but professionally he is brilliant). She laid her reasoning out in excruciating detail, he listened though because she was not enjoying it at all, it was sincere. Some seemed to have clicked because since that talk he has been different with her. I just am not getting my hopes up.

**Commenter 2:** When two crazies are feeding off each other‚Äôs crazy they can start thinking anything is possible. I have a feeling that even if your son leaves her she‚Äôs not going to go away peacefully. Her and your ex sound like peas in a pod unfortunately.

> **OOP:** My daughter really went at him pointing out their similarities. She made her case well and thankfully it shook him up.

**AITAH for being disgusted and just saying OK when my Fianc√© broke up with me?**

&#x200B;

So... idk man.

I (28) had been with my fianc√© (Alex 34) since 2020. We met at a friend‚Äôs party, hit it off, and have/had been together ever since.

He finished his Doctorate in Economics just last year. Since then he has been working at the Uni. I have my Master‚Äôs in Media Sciences and decided to start working instead of going for a PhD.

Okay... so the problem is that Alex broke up with me last Monday. It was literally so surreal and honestly... just weird.

For the past few months, he‚Äôd been acting strange. He was making demands and then dropping them immediately. A few examples: he told me we were going to paint our walls back from dark green to white. When I asked why, he just said, ""For fuck's sake, forget it,"" and never brought it up again, even when I asked.

Another time, he came home and got mad because I was sitting on the couch with my head covered in a blanket (I had cramps). He was upset because I was ‚Äújust sitting there watching Netflix‚Äù (mind you, the house was spotless). When I tried to talk about it, he said, ‚ÄúForget it, it‚Äôs not a big deal.‚Äù

This kind of thing became common. Every time I tried to communicate... tried to figure out what was going on, whether it was something I did or maybe he was just stressed at work... he would just say everything was fine, but he was clearly seething with rage. I didn‚Äôt even have to do anything; he would find something to complain about (the apartment, clothes, me, work, etc.).

So, I gave him space, which apparently was also wrong. I told him I was going to help my parents with repairs for a few days, and somehow that was also wrong because he wanted to renovate the apartment too.

Then, on Monday, I got a text saying we needed to talk. I knew what was coming, and after the last few months, I had made peace with it.

When I came home, he was sitting on the couch. He didn‚Äôt even wait for me to take off my jacket before saying, ""I want to break up."" Then the verbal diarrhea started.

He told me he resented me. First, because I didn‚Äôt pursue my academic career further, even though I was capable, and he didn‚Äôt want to upset me at the time. Then, when I started making more money (since he didn‚Äôt make much as a PhD student), he felt like I should have the last word financially, and he hated it.

Mind you, I never said anything like ‚Äúit‚Äôs my money, so I have the final say.‚Äù That‚Äôs a rule he imposed on himself, and he hated it.

He said he hated our paint scheme, the couch, and even our fucking crockpot.

Then, he told me he had rejected a better PhD program to stay here because I had already started my job by the time he got the acceptance letters. Only, he never told me he had even applied overseas. He said a few months ago he checked in with a friend who‚Äôs in that program, saw how they were thriving, and decided I ruined his life. He said I had too much control over his life and that he hated the idea that I could just decide not to pay for things and ‚Äúfuck him over‚Äù (I honestly don‚Äôt even know what that means).

He also said he hated that all his friends loved me and didn‚Äôt let him vent about me.

Then he said again, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done.‚Äù

I was floored. I had already made peace with the idea that we were ending, and it hurt, but after that rant, I was just disgusted. I looked at him, probably with a disgusted expression, and said, ""Okay.""

He lost it. He said this is exactly what he meant... that it was horrible. We had been together for four years, and all I had to say was ‚Äúokay‚Äù to our breakup?

I just asked if he wanted to stay here while he figured out where to go. He said, ‚ÄúTypical, of course you‚Äôre holding the apartment over me,‚Äù and started ranting again, so I just left.

I told my parents, and they‚Äôre also confused. My dad suggested I reach out to our landlord and explain the situation to see what options I have. I can keep paying the rent no problem myself. He covered the utilities and some subscriptions.

Just to reiterate, I never had a problem with this. I saw that he was chasing his dream, and that was more important to me than a 50/50 financial split. I make good money and am happy at my job. I never saw it as ‚Äúslaving away.‚Äù I always had the mentality that my money was our money because we were building a life together. Of course, I had my own savings and fun money, but I honestly never cared. As long as I felt he was working towards something and wasn‚Äôt taking advantage of me, I was fine with it. More than fine.

Alex is still mad. He‚Äôs going between texting me like a robot about the logistics of the split to being a seething asshole complaining about everything. I‚Äôm not even hurt anymore. I just feel nauseated by him at this point.

I don‚Äôt know. Should I have reacted differently?

Edit: Thank you for all your opinions! It was nice to get this off my chest, lol.

Just to clarify, tho. I don't feel like a victim. I feel like something happened, and my relationship just turned bad. He behaved like an asshole but that is the extent of it. Very clearly, something is going on. But he doesn't want me to be part of whatever it is, and I have to respect that.

Now I just have to detangle myself legally from him, and after that, I'll just be left alone with my ugly green wall color. I think I might also adopt a cat as my ex was really allergic.

*Dude basically hates himself for decisions he took without ever consulting you. He chose his comforts but now since others seem in a better position he is venting on you and making you the culprit. NTA but your man has a little brain and doesn't know what to do with it.*

>OOP: I would have supported im if he wanted to move away. Idk if we would have stayed together because LDR's are hard, but i would have been 100% supportive.

&#x200B;

**Estebesol**

*I suspect he was afraid or had other reasons to turn down that PhD - or maybe never even applied, but believes he would have got it if he did - but chooses to blame you rather than acknowledge that.*

&#x200B;

**hastykoala**

*He probably chose this one bc she would be there to pay the bills. It‚Äôs more stable.*

&#x200B;

**Soft-Requirement-461**

*Girl I‚Äôve been with a man like that. They want drama. They want toxicity. They will fuck up your life out of pure insecurity and hate. You dodged a MASSIVE bullet. I‚Äôm sorry this happened, you deserve better. Wish you the best*

>OOP: Then I hope he meets the Telenovela star of his dreams! I prefer my boring happy life

&#x200B;

**RantyMcThrowaway**

*NTA. Dude basically said he hates you and everything about you. What are you supposed to do, beg for his love when you can find someone who'll give it to you readily? Nah. Sorry this happened and that you were blindsided, but this will be a good thing in the long run. Onto the next.*

*FWIW he sounds jealous, insecure and emotionally stunted. If what you've written is how things played out then you dodged a huge bullet.*

>OOP: He was basically doing his own renditions of ""10 things I hate about you"". Idk... I mean he wants to break up with me, why would i plead? It is done

&#x200B;

**\*\*Judgement - NTA\*\***

&#x200B;

**Update - 1 month later**

&#x200B;

To start, Alex moved out pretty quickly after the breakup. He has been staying with a friend, and we sorted out everything like mail, subscriptions, and the lease.

I‚Äôm also in the process of adopting a cat. Her name is Luna, but I have been thinking about changing it since my family already has two pets named Luna, a Moon, and Qamar. She is still at her foster home for now, but I have visited her a few times, and I already adore her. She is a scrappy little tabby who follows her foster mom around like a shadow, and I can‚Äôt wait for her to move in during the first week of December. I‚Äôve already gotten her bowls, toys, and a bed by the window ready.

Now onto what happened. Last week, I was out showing someone around the city. He is the son of my parents‚Äô friends who recently moved here for work. My parents asked me to help him get familiar with the area, so I agreed. It was nothing special, just walking around, grabbing coffee, and pointing out useful spots in the city.

Apparently, Alex saw us.

I didn‚Äôt even realize he was there, but later that night, I started getting texts from an unknown number. I guess he got a new number since I blocked his old one. The texts were just weird. He accused me of flaunting my ‚Äúnew relationship‚Äù in public, said I must have been seeing this guy before we broke up, and told me that everything he suspected about me was true.

I didn‚Äôt respond. I wasn‚Äôt going to entertain his paranoia. The messages kept coming though. They went from angry to desperate, with him saying things like, ‚ÄúAt least admit you were lying to me,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúWas anything about us even real?‚Äù It was exhausting and honestly a little scary to see how quickly he spiraled.

For the record, this guy isn‚Äôt my boyfriend. He‚Äôs not even someone I‚Äôm interested in. He‚Äôs just the son of family friends who needed help settling into the city. The whole thing was completely innocent, but Alex has twisted it into some kind of betrayal in his head.

What gets me is how little Alex seems to know me. I‚Äôm not the type of person to jump into a relationship so soon after everything that happened. Even if I were, it wouldn‚Äôt be any of his business. We are done. I‚Äôve made that clear.

After I didn‚Äôt respond to his texts, Alex started calling. I didn‚Äôt pick up, but the voicemails were a mix of angry rants and desperate pleas. I ended up blocking his new number too. It feels ridiculous that I have to keep doing this, but I guess this is where we are now.

Then this weekend, I went out to a bar with my friends. A few hours in, guess who walked in? Alex.

I don‚Äôt know if it was a coincidence or if he followed me there, but as soon as he spotted me, he came straight over. He was clearly upset, asking to talk, and I told him no. My friends stepped in, and thankfully, he left without causing a scene, but it ruined my night. It felt like I couldn‚Äôt escape him, no matter where I went or what I did.

When I got home later that night, I was completely drained. I had just started to relax when I heard a knock on my door. It was Alex, standing there in tears.

He started crying, saying he missed me, that he didn‚Äôt understand why I was ‚Äúdoing this to him,‚Äù and that he didn‚Äôt know how to move on. It was like all the anger from earlier had been replaced with this desperate sadness. I didn‚Äôt let him in. I told him he needed to leave, and if he didn‚Äôt, I would call someone to make him leave. He begged me to listen, but I just closed the door.

I spent the rest of the night feeling shaken and honestly a little scared. I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs going through. I wrote his best friend about the situation but the plea of talking to him. He said he would.

I‚Äôm seriously considering getting a new phone number and possibly even talking to someone about how to handle this legally if it keeps happening. It feels unfair that I have to go to these lengths just to have some peace, but I don‚Äôt see another option. .

*I think keep track of every call, text and VM, collect a ""paper trail"" in case you need to go the legal route. Maybe get an additional lock on your door just in case.*

*He's obviously unstable and has been for a while. Just focus on yourself and your new chapter in life, don't feed into his crap.*

*Check for a tracking device and check all your apps and setting to make sure you aren‚Äôt accidentally sharing you location with anyone.*

**cthulularoo**

*yeah, him ""coincidentally"" running into her twice while she's out seems not at all coincidental.*

&#x200B;

**anothertypicalcmmnt**

*""Once is a coincidence, twice is a pattern."" - I can't imagine that he just happened to see you when you were out in the city twice. Definitely get prepared in case you need to file a restraining order and take legal action. Be sure to practice good safety like locking doors and windows. Maybe even preemptively tell whoever works the front desk or whatever at work to not let him in if he comes to your work place?*

*Hopefully overtime he will come to see that this relationship is completely over, and he will stop bothering you.*

1h0wiq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1h0wiq6/does_anybody_really_know_what_time_it_is/,Does anybody really know what time it is? ,"So let's suppose for a moment that a hypothetical nurse has found themselves in a little hot water over attendance. Let's set the scene, shall we?

Imagine this nurse runs a little bit late in the mornings. Never more than 10 minutes, average of say, 3-5, sometimes, not at all. Never ever actually misses a shift, has a strong constitution and simply doesn't get sick. Has a strong mind and is willing to set any emotional upsets aside for the day, knows you're never fully dressed without a smile, and will consistently still show up for work. 

Hypothetical Hospital expects everyone to clock in 30 minutes prior to the start of the shift ""for report"" but it's actually to cover that 30 minute uninterrupted lunch break it's rumored that nurses take. This nurse is painfully aware that the time is now 20 minutes prior, but already has their coat off and everything they need to start. The previous nurse is found, report is received without incident (slow night, just waiting for a ride home for one... Oops I forgot to call! No worries, we've got all day!), they lay eyes on this person together like food bedside reporters and bid the previous shift farewell... They still have 10 minutes left but it's nice to get out early and warm up your car first. 

While this nurse knocks out the next 12 hours, you don't really see or hear from them much... They aren't hiding or anything, they just have a system they've figured out over the last 12 years and they know the pace that their workplace ticks along at. So for example, their patient needs to go to imaging in 10 minutes, that gives them just enough time to get specimens from two other patients that have repeat labs, so they get that out of the way before they take the third one over. It's just faster than calling transport to take the few steps. 

When they get back, they notice that someone new has come in and registered... They're all caught up right now, so they go get this person and walk them to a room and get their chart organized and begin their workup. Someone else might be assigned to do this at Hypothetical Hospital, but why make them wait? Never hurts to be helpful, and it's better to work ahead and stay on top of things and avoid surprises. 

As you probably have figured out, this nurse isn't really a complainer and doesn't really need to be. Doesn't need to bother the techs too much but is always thankful when they pitch in. Always takes the call to start an IV somewhere, to fix a prescription, to fix a printer, to fix the sweeper for housekeeping, to get the radio, look up phone numbers, answer the phone, scan in a chart, etc. Nothing is really a big deal that can't be handled in under 60 seconds for the most part here. 

But... Dang it there's that hot water again. Late late late and in trouble for 'being an inconvenience to coworkers"" and ""having poor time management"". At one point ""Not being anxious enough (!!)"" 

BUT... is that nurse really late? If the shift hasn't changed over yet? If everyone got out on time? If they had report taken while the on time people were making coffee and looking at tiktok? If they didn't take the full lunch break that 30 minutes is supposed to make up for? If no patient had to wait for anything? If nothing was left undone? If they ended up going home early anyway because census was low? Or because scheduling gets befuddled and puts too many people on a shift and they didn't really need to be there in the first place? If they stayed late not only to make up the time, but also to help clean up for the oncoming shift (which is also the shift they releive in the morning) 

Would you discipline this nurse? Asking for a friend who stepped down from the manager role and reintegrated back to staff in the same department... Timeliness was never her focus when she managed either.

In anticipation of the newly announced and upcoming (hopefully soon) series I decided to rewatch all 3 Long Ways. 
What started out as a dot-point journal of my thoughts exploded into this big report.

**tl;dr: A really long essay about my thoughts on the Long Way series**


**Me, and my history with Long Way**

I‚Äôm a relatively late-comer to the series. I was a kid when the first 2 came out and had never seen them. I have been a huge star wars fan since childhood, so I was by proxy a fan of Ewan McGregor, but other than having read briefly about him doing a trip with a friend of his on his Wikipedia page, I knew nothing about the show.


After finishing university and starting full-time work, I could finally afford to start riding a motorcycle, something I‚Äôd always dreamt of doing. A friend from uni (and at that time housemate) had ridden bikes since he was a teenager, and he guided me into the world of motorbikes. He was my first riding buddy ‚Äì starting out riding ahead of me so I felt safe and supported on the road, he helped me to build my confidence to start riding further than just my regular commuting route. We rode twisties and country roads together, and eventually started doing track days. I had become obsessed with motorcycles, and was consuming as much Motorcycle-based entertainment as I could in my spare time. Mostly gear channels and bike review stuff - Fortnine back when it was mostly a review channel and not a high concept short film powerhouse, and regrettably a lot of Yammie Noob (forgive me, I was young).

In Late 2020, during COVID lockdown I saw a post on Reddit about the premiere episode of Long Way Up ‚Äì Ewan McGregor and his mate reuniting for another motorcycle trip. Obviously, the comments were full of recommendations to watch Long Way Round and Down. So I picked up a 2nd hand copy of the DVD box set on ebay and off I went.

I binge watched Long Way Round and Down, then caught up with Long Way Up as it aired, and I was well and truly obsessed. Locked down at home, yearning to ride again with my buddy, to adventure out of the restricted travel radius from my home and see the world, and a longing for the pre-pandemic normality of the world ‚Äì I found the series at the perfect time. 

Since then, I‚Äôve rewatched the series multiple times ‚Äì It has become my go-to comfort show. I‚Äôve read the books, watched Charley‚Äôs Race to Dakar and By Any Means series, and ventured out to other adventure motorcycling content - C90 Adventures, Itchy Boots and North and Left a Bit to name some favourites.

Due to the combination of COVID, Charley and Ewan getting older and more successful in their respective careers, and the uncertainty of streaming shows getting renewed these days, I had made peace with the fact that Long Way was finished. When the news broke in August that the crew was coming back for another instalment, I was over the moon, and felt another rewatch was in order.
So here are my reflections on the series after rewatching with the eyes of a fanatic. For context I watched the extended editions of the 2 original series

**Long Way Round**

To start with a completely uncontroversial opinion ‚Äì the OG is by far the best of the 3. The series has such a captivating energy of uncertainty and discovery that the other 2 just can‚Äôt match. 

The preparation episodes were a great watch ‚Äì watching a hare-brained idea by 2 mates to ride around the world take shape. You really get the sense that they were sort of making it up as they went along ‚Äì solving problems only for more to pop up, all the time realising they were getting themselves into something much bigger than expected. The dramas seemed to be never-ending ‚Äì The KTM vs BMW bike choice, Ewan struggling in the off-road training and the saga with Claudio and his motorcycle test.

Watching these early episodes back now with hindsight and further context really added to my enjoyment of seeing the whole thing come together. Obviously we know that everything worked out in the end, but at the time this was completely uncharted territory. They were being told time and again that the trip was not possible on motorbikes, and adding to that the production of a tv series and all the moving parts that entails, the pressure they were under was enormous. Charley has spoken about this here and there in interview (including this excellent recent podcast appearance I watched last night https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMeEQQQcwVg) but at that time his acting career was in a major rut. He was doing more building work than acting and looking down the barrel of giving up on a career in entertainment entirely. With a young family at home, taking 3 months off to travel was a major risk for his livelihood, and the uncertainty of even succeeding with the trip, let alone the show/book being successful would have surely been bubbling away in the back of his mind. Rewatching the series with this context makes the drama and struggle feel so much more visceral. The boys truly were in uncharted territory. 

The show is an amazing snapshot of a moment in time, a world before ubiquitous internet where globalisation was just starting to pick up steam. The boys marvelling at the amazing ‚Äúmodern‚Äù technology making the trip possible ‚Äì Brick phones with GPS and bulky digital camcorders and helmet comms/camera setups that look like they weigh a tonne. The show, particularly the early episodes of planning and traveling through Western Europe made me weirdly nostalgic for the early 2000s ‚Äì technology and society was advancing so rapidly, and the world really felt like it was shrinking and becoming much more accessible. Even small things like the fashion, the now-retro designs of the bikes and cars and the 4:3 aspect ratio transported me back to simpler times.  The ex-soviet states they journeyed through feel like places out of time, the predominately agricultural regions of Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and the wilderness of Mongolia. The visit to Igor‚Äôs house was seriously bizarre (even more strange details in the book which I would recommend reading if you haven‚Äôt. I feel this set the tone for the adventure ahead, and felt like a really great microcosm of the weird and wonderful experiences of overland travel.

After 2 full episodes of prep, the show wastes no time getting into the interesting stuff ‚Äì the first week of the trip is covered in about 3 minutes of montage (owing to Claudio‚Äôs absence as he was stuck in the UK re-sitting his motorcycle test). The middle section of the trip, from Ukraine onwards is where it really comes alive. Travelling through the wilderness of Mongolia, meeting people by the roadside and just living in the landscape conveys such a raw and real sense of adventure.  Even with the support crew the boys still end up in strife and need to get themselves out of it through grit, ingenuity and at times sheer luck and the kindness of strangers. The obstacles seem never ending ‚Äì the near-impassable terrain nearly breaking Ewan‚Äôs spirit, Claudio‚Äôs broken frame getting fixed only to inadvertently fry the ABS, the replacement bike that constantly breaks down and needs to be fixed by passing Mongolians, and finding the one guy in Chita who speaks amazing English to help them smuggle the bikes and themselves onto a cargo train. The show has such a ‚Äúby the seat of their pants‚Äù energy that is amazing to see even after so many rewatches ‚Äì I can‚Äôt help but compare this to the way problems arise and are dealt with in Long Way Up (more on that later). Here, the journey, it‚Äôs setbacks and solutions seem so organic and real.

Nowhere is this more evident than the Road of Bones. The boys are tested by the  bad roads, broken bridges and high rivers, but the great challenge of the journey proves to be nearly too much for them. Even with all the preparation and support, neither the bikes nor cars can do it alone. The boys teaming up with a crew of Russian truck drivers to push through the final stretch at all costs is the most ‚Äúadventure‚Äù part of all 3 series.

The North American part of the trip definitely feels like a victory lap, but serves as a nice epilogue to the trip. The slower pace, the social visits and the general feeling of relief makes the trip overall quite a satisfying watch. I think the pacing of Long Way Round is by far the best of the 3 series.

**Some other points that occurred to me on the rewatch:**

* Charley comes off as a bit of an arse early on. His blow-up about the KTM, while iconic, seems a bit childish (especially when you think about how they were asking for the bikes FOR FREE), and his argument with Russ about the Carnet when he was at fault for being careless is also a bit hard to watch. He shines during the middle section of the trip ‚Äì he‚Äôs obviously a much better rider (particularly off road) than Ewan but he doesn‚Äôt get frustrated or berate him for having difficulty.
* Claudio is a legend. He is featured much more in Long Way Round than any other series ‚Äì he‚Äôs funny and capable, and completely unfazed by anything that goes wrong (including his many crashes), and he‚Äôs pulling double duty riding AND filming. The lynch-pin of the show
* The ‚Äúlocal flavour‚Äù segments are great fun and we get some truly hilarious moments. The brutal Turkish massage, the wrestling in Mongolia, the dodgy Russian Lake Shamanand the highlight: ‚Äúwhat do people do in Tynda?‚Äù ‚Äì hard cut to dancing in a nightclub.
* The UNICEF stuff I can take or leave. I understand that as a UNICEF ambassador Ewan would want to incorporate this into the trip and raise the profile of these programs at the time the show aired, but actors visiting these places for photo ops always feels a bit tone-deaf to me. The visits in Long Way Round definitely feel the least produced and preachy of the 3 series, and Ewan meeting his now adopted daughter Jamyan in Mongolia is an interesting story to look back on in hindsight. Ultimately, I think that the UNICEF stuff was at least partly to ‚Äúgive back‚Äù and dispel any sense of exploitation of just riding through developing countries as a backdrop for an adventure TV show
* Looking back, it‚Äôs amazing that the trip succeeded at all. There were so many setbacks along the way that had not been prepared for, and seemingly were overcome just by sheer grit and determination. In future iterations the support crew play a much more significant role, and the feeling of adventure does feel diminished compared to the OG series.

**LONG WAY DOWN**

Straight off the bat Long Way Down feels very much like a rehash of Round. Understandable they would want to recreate the success of the OG. Familiar things like planning the route and preparations play out very similarly to Round, but the first few episodes have a different vibe - the tension of ""is this possible?"" is no longer there, replaced instead with a sort of ""Sophomore Album Syndrome"" energy, the need to make a bigger and better follow up.

The schedule for the first leg of the trip (Scotland to Sudan) seemed way too tight, with the trip hinging on making not one but two ferries with firm deadlines. Add to this the extra pre-trip dramas of Ewan's broken leg, Charley's wife's collapsed lung and Eve joining the trip (more on that later), the vibe is very tense. Through Europe the focus seems to be on making up miles every day, and combined with the rain there isn't much chance to smell the roses. There are some nice breaks in Italy with the Moto Guzzi factory and visiting some Roman ruins in North Africa, but this part of the trip has an uncomfortable aura.

The tone shifts dramatically after the Sudan to become more scenic travel show than a gruelling adventure into the unknown like Long Way Round was. The dirt roads take their toll on the bikes, but there is n where near the difficulty encountered in Mongolia or Russia. On a rewatch, I quite liked the trip from Sudan onwards. The landscape is beautiful, the boys camp and enjoy each other's company, and the show settles into being a more fun and relaxed travelogue.

The support crew is definitely staying a lot closer this time around, and the lack of ""aloneness"" is very distinct from Long Way Round. They spend a lot of nights glamping in picturesque locales and staying in beautiful lodges - a far cry from the mud of Mongolia. We even have a similar ""river crossing"" situation, this time easily overcome by winches. The whole thing just seems a lot less perilous than Long Way Round, and the bonding though adversity is nowhere near the Road of Bones.

The UNICEF and cultural emersion stuff is a lot more heavy handed than in Round, bordering on preachy at times, and looking back on the show today it does have a whiff of ""white saviour"" about it. Again, as UNICEF ambassadors the boys no doubt are keen to showcase projects in the region to give back and raise their profile among viewers, but outside of these intentional program visits the rest of the trip does seem to be trying to shine a light on ‚Äúthe real Africa‚Äù and challenge negative perceptions of the continent. There‚Äôs lots of guided tours of old ruins, stuff about local industries, aid efforts and showcases of how far Africa is developing. All interesting stuff but there seemed to be this inescapable artifice about it all. ‚Äì. The more organic ‚Äúfly on the wall‚Äù experiences of local culture from LWR are supplanted here by a more curated lens which seems to be making efforts to convey a more uplifting and inspiring view of things. There are some interesting and more real encounters with communities living traditional tribal lifestyles, but they are undercut by things like Russ casually asking a cotton mill to explain their production process in detail, or the numerous visits to coffee sellers/flower farms/tobacco auctions to name a few. 

The whole situation with the president of Rwanda is a bit bizarre, and the crew gets swept up into what seems to be international PR for the Rwandan government. I can't help but think back to Kazakhstan in Long Way Round where the boys where peeved at being paraded around the country and being made a spectacle, now theyre putting on suits to meet heads of state. On the surface they're smiling, but I get the sense they didn't know how to handle the situation without coming off as disrespectful so they went along with everything.
The intentions and behaviour of the team do seem sincere, but looking back on it in retrospect, combined with the overall cringey ""We are the world""/""I am Africa"" tone of the narration, the whole thing feels a bit less genuine and cynical than the encounters the boys had with Mongolian locals bumping into them on the roadside. I don't doubt that the beauty of the experience was moving for them, but it feels a bit disingenuous that this is juxtaposed to the undeniable privilege of traveling by motorbike with a support crew making a TV show about you.

Ultimately, on this rewatch the series felt like a bit of a chore, and not nearly as interesting this time around. In LWR, the entertainment came from the struggle ‚Äì in watching the boys face and overcome obstacles with a smile and a laugh ‚Äì I could watch the boys get in and out of strife like this for hours. LWD seemed to be divided into 2 equally tedious halves ‚Äì The time-pressured sprint to Africa, and the showcase of the majesty of Southern Africa. The time spent off the bike showcasing the local flavour was utterly uninteresting to me on this rewatch ‚Äì it‚Äôs less adventure and more humanitarian travel-documentary, 

**A few other thoughts on the series** 

*  After the success of LWR this series undoubtedly has a much higher profile. They meet several people along the way who had been following their exploits online, who stop by to say hello or offer help. The whole thing is very quaint compared to the fan-mobbing they get in Long Way Up (more on that later). I recently stumbled upon the original LWD website which the BBC has archived (https://www.bbc.co.uk/longwaydown/journal/ewan_entries.shtml), and it‚Äôs a fascinating artefact of mid 2000s internet ‚Äì reminds me of the fake websites I used to make in computer science class while learning how to use html.
*  The medic, Dai, is absolute class. Such a cool guy who integrated so well into the team. He gets a great amount of screentime for a non-producer crew member, and is always a highlight. Compared to the incredibly grumpy doctor Vasili in Long Way Round, this guy is a hoot.
*  Eve joining the trip was such a strange thing. I can understand her wanting to be involved in the trip given how amazing/life changing Long Way Round must have been, but to insist you wanted to ride a bike in Africa having never ridden a bike before is a big swing. With the proximity of the support crew during the African leg of the trip, she could have easily ridden in the cars, or rode pillion with Ewan and had a great experience. She sort of inserted herself into the adventure in the most inconvenient way possible to the rest of the crew. Charley was obviously pissed off from the beginning but didn't rock the boat, but it was an undeniable source of tension. It all turned out ok in that she rode and didn't have any major issues, but it has always struck me as a bizarre move. Ewan seemed enthusiastic for his (at the time) loving wife to join the adventure. I won't say it ruined the vibe but it definitely had an effect. Ewan seemed to lack some self awareness in this regard - he didn't seem to pick up on how this made Charley feel and the extra layer of difficulty it would present for the trip.
- Claudio once again is MVP
- Charley was on some of his worst behaviour. The bomb thing, the wheelie argument, causing a crash with Claudio while showing off to some locals. I think the pressure early on did get to him and he acted out a bit.

**LONG WAY UP**

This was actually my first re-watch of Long Way Up. I first saw this series when it came out in 2020, rolling straight into it after binge watching Round and Down. I caught up with the airing schedule half way through the series and watched the rest week to week. The last couple episodes fizzled out for me on first watch so I wasn't super keen to revisit it. It wasn't until the announcement of Long Way Home that I felt a need to rewatch, mainly because, as the most recent series it will likely be closer to what Long Way Home will be.

I enjoyed it much more on rewatch. On first viewing I had no real concept of the passage of time between series, as the whole thing was completely new to me. Now having seen the original 2 series multiple times I can better appreciate how different this one is. Also, going into the series knowing what will happen allowed me to enjoy it more for what it is, rather than an expectation based on the original series.

Admittedly, the series is a mixed bag of things that have copped a lot of fairly deserved criticism in online discourse.

This iteration is much more produced than the previous series - probably a combination of the higher profile of both Ewan and Charley now compared to in the 2000s, and the switch to Apple TV from the BBC. The fixers and local producers are featured much more prominently, and a lot of the problems later on in the series boil down to ""just throw some money at it"". This adventure seems a lot less accessible for an average adventure rider without the resources of this production. 

The conceit of using electric vehicles is played initially as an off-hand fascination by Ewan (who had previously been preparing a petrol dual sport bike for the trip in the opposite direction) but very quickly balloons into a massive undertaking. It honestly defies belief that to make the trip possible 2 different companies had to rush production on prototype electric vehicles, not to mention HD heavily modifying the Livewire to make a completely bespoke and unattainable bike set up (until that legend on this subreddit recreated it himself), and Rivian installing EV charging infrastructure for a route across an ENTIRE CONTINENT. And as if that wasn't enough, they shipped everything from the finish line to the start line just so they could call the show Long Way Up.

The amount of resources needed to get this thing going is absolutely absurd. While Round and Down had long preparations and support crews/sponsored equipment, the trips still seemed POSSIBLE for an everyday adventurer to undertake if they weren't also filming a TV show. That is completely out the window this time around.
It seems like the series took a long time to get started. While the timeframe from the very beginning to when rubber first hits the road is never stated, the first episode jumps around so much, from visiting multiple different countries, the production of the vehicles and Charley's severe accident and recovery, I can only assume it would have taken at least 2 years.

And after all that fanfare, the trip starts and the first few episodes of travelling are plagued by low range and charging issues. Ewan does call attention to it, but it is disappointing to see so much money, time and effort be poured into something for it to flop right out of the gate.
The charging issue becomes less prominent after episode 4 - but it's unclear if things actually improved with the warmer weather and they did it ""properly"", or they just decided to cheat using portable diesel generators and edit around them. I get a sense that they bit off more than they could chew with the electric bikes, but it was too late and they had to follow through.
Ultimately I don't think this completely invalidates the series - at its core the series has been about solving problems on a journey ‚Äì but the problems here just seem so outside the realm of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù due to the overcomplicating element of the electric bikes and the behemoth size of the production, and thus require such ridiculously convoluted and expensive solutions ‚Äì Things just feel so much more complicated than the organic ""We need to cross this river"" problems of Long Way Round.

The Ewan-Charley relationship is the bedrock of these series, and at the beginning it honestly felt very tense. After losing touch over the years, the boys reunite for another adventure, but in the first couple of episodes the relationship seems strained. Ewan is doing his best to be positive and charismatic, but Charley seems very despondent. On first watch I worried that the relationship had soured - that the ""2 friends reuniting"" was just a show for the cameras to sell the new series. The preparation was so much more fragmented than the previous series, without the camaraderie of spending 6 months together preparing for the trip. 

 In retrospect, Charley was likely struggling physically due to his previous injuries and the cold weather - he's pushing on valiantly and keeping his struggle to himself, a massive change in maturity compared to his more childish outbursts in the original series.

Things really improve from about episode 4. The weather gets warmer, the range and charging anxiety is not so prominently featured, and we see an excellent mix of scenic riding shots and interesting stops. 
The section of the trip from northern Peru to Columbia is the most enjoyable chunk of the series for me. The visit to Machu Pichu is a highlight, but on rewatch I love the moments where they are just hanging out - meeting locals and soaking up the local culture. This is where to me it felt like the series got it's groove back.

On rewatch, I enjoyed episodes 9-11 a lot more. They are definitely bike-lite, and the editing does race through the countries a lot faster than those earlier in the series, but there are a lot of enjoyable moments. The boat trip up the Columbian coastline is quite sublime, and Ewan flying as ""crew"" on the cargo ship with the bikes is a hilarious flashback to the Russian cargo train from Long Way Round. I wish they had spent more runtime on Central America - the boys seem to be enjoying themselves and the locations are beautiful, but it flies by so quickly in montage edit.

Now the moment where the show fell apart for many - the bus.
I can't imagine this was something that had been planned for or considered ahead of time. They speak vaguely about security concerns and cartel activity heating up at the time - specifically there had been a massacre of 2 American families (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBar%C3%B3n_and_Langford_families_massacre) near the US border only weeks before.
I imagine there was major pressure from production and insurance companies not to ride through Mexico at all. The reason for the tight deadline is also never acknowledged, presumably due to some other movie contract of Ewan's . The bus was probably the only workable option other than just flying home

I actually quite enjoyed the ""Dave's Do Ups"" section with the bus. The boys got their hands dirty working on the bus, and it was nice that the Mexican workers got a shout out for their hard work (I hope they were also paid well). It had a similar flavour to the river crossings of Long Way Round - a real ""we need to push through this together"" vibe. While I acknowledge the bus thing does represent  a ‚Äúconvoluted and expensive solution to a problem‚Äù that I was lamenting above, at least in the instance the crew gets their hands dirty to solve the problem. This for me is the equivalent of the river crossings in LWR and LWD.

Disappointingly after all the bus prep, it doesn't seem like they rode through Northern Mexico at all. There was lots of chat about ""riding through the day and driving the bus overnight"" but the edit makes it seem like they only took the bikes off the bus once. A quick Google maps search puts the journey from Oaxaca to Juarez as 2200km, an estimated 26hr trip. It does seem like they just kept moving continuously, rode a bit for the edit, then got back on the bus to hide.
They ultimately got to cross the border on their bikes and ride into LA, but it does feel like we got short changed by them *mostly riding bikes from Ushuaia to LA.

**Some other thoughts:**

*  This is by far the best looking of the 3 series. The landscapes are incredible, and Claudio's drone photography is sublime. The visuals of the show really elevate it as an excellent travel show and a great feast for the eyes
*  Dave acts pretty unhinged at times in this series. He was probably under immense pressure as a producer to make the trip a success, and he gets pretty intense when there are setbacks. It seems he was spearheading the EV logistics and was taking on a lot more than the others in terms of making the trip possible. His craziness reaches its peak in episode 6 with the Rivian's brake and suspension issue. His behaviour it totally manic, and he puts himself in a lot of danger trying to get the thing moving ASAP. In hindsight, I think the high altitude contributed a lot to his erratic behaviour. While he didn't get as sick as Taylor, high altitude makes you hypoxic, and can affect how your brain functions. Combine that with the pressure he was under and his behaviour makes more sense.
Love it or hate it, he managed to make the bus conversion happen through sheer force of will, and I have to admire his tenacity.
*  The series can't seem to escape Ewan's increased star power compared to the original series. On Round and Down, a few people here and there in Europe asked for autographs, but once they were off the beaten track they were essentially anonymous (as much as you can be with a cameraman following you around). Ewan even managed to go to a Star Wars based tourist attraction with a poster of him on the wall and not get recognized. Here we have hundreds of people getting selfies at Machu Pichu, a mob of fans outside a cafe and Chilean lobby boys saying ""may the force be with you"". Where before he seemed like a more grounded ""working actor"" he definitely gives off a more celebrity vibe, wearing fashionable if less functional bike gear, with perfect hair at all times. He still acts much the same and seems to still be pretty down-to-earth.
*  Charley has changed a lot. Charley's long list of achievements since the original Long Ways are relatively downplayed - he is so much better travelled and more experienced as a rider since the last time around, having done his By Any Means series and spent years leading motorcycle tours overseas. He may not have wanted to highlight that stuff, but the series does give the surface level narrative that all he's done since Long Way Round is nearly die in a motorcycle crash and obtain crippling injuries. He seems to have matured a lot since Long Way Round/Down where he was a bit of a brat at times (see above).
*  Jamyan joining the trip was an interesting premise, but not featured very heavily probably due to the frenetic editing of the episode she appeared in. I was relieved she was not also riding a bike for the first time like her mother did.
*  Age and life circumstances seem to have made this trip a difficult one for everyone. Ewan and Russ spoke a few times about this trip feeling a lot longer than the others, and while Charley did improve enough to pop a few wheelies and do some casual side saddle riding late in the trip, the weight of his injuries was evident - from the tension of crossing bad desert roads, to his hike up to Machu Picchu. The numerous set backs and need for non-motorcycle travel would have also been pretty taxing. All this stuff seemed to weigh down the trip and detract from the core business of boys on bikes enjoying the journey.

**Long Way Home and beyond** 

If you've made it this far, you can obviously tell I'm excited for Long Way Home. While we've had next to no information about the trip at this time, allow me to speculate on what it could look like, and hopefully the lessons they learned from the previous series

The route:

*  An out and back route in Europe is a great idea. 
*  In the original 2 series, the travel through Europe felt like a chore before ""the real trip"" and was mostly skimmed over. Riding though Scandinavia and Eastern Europe should be interesting - lots of scenic vistas and culture to soak up, but still having opportunities to go off the beaten track in the countryside 
- Logistically it will be much easier, allowing for more focus on overland travel. No impassable jungles to fly over or major dangers that need to be avoided. Other than some ferry rides, this may end up being the most ""pure"" trip - no flights, just wheels on the ground.

The Crew:

*  Obviously Ewan and Charley are returning.
* Ewan is still as famous as ever. Charley is very active these days on YouTube and social media, doing a recent Thailand adventure trip sponsored by Touratech (a great watch) and is back running his Australia and Africa motorcycle tours. You can't keep this guy off a bike, and he seems to have recovered a lot more from his injuries and be fitter than in LWU
*  The less remote/foreign nature of the trip will lend itself to less need for local producers and fixers. Each subsequent series has had more people involved to keep the trip running, and the cast of newbies in Long Way Up seemed to squeeze out screentime for other crew members like Claudio and Jimmy. Hopefully the gang will be smaller and more tight knit.
*  A more accessible route will make it more likely that the whole band will be back together. I can't imagine a Long Way trip without Claudio. He's still very active as a filmmaker and still rides, so hopefully he'll be involved again

The vehicles:

*  No more electric bikes is a good move. Even with more EV infrastructure in Europe, Long Way Up proved that a trip like this on electric bikes is not possible without an insane amount of support and accommodations being made. The move to Vintage bikes from the previous large bore ADV bikes is a welcome change in my opinion - it lends a new dimension of interest to the trip. Will there be break downs? I'm excited for an ""Easy Rider"" type of adventure.
*  What bike will Claudio ride? He still owns and rides his original GS1150 from Long Way Round - I think he should ride this again for Long Way Home. It would fit with the ""Well-loved Bikes"" Ewan and Charley are riding and be a great throwback to the original series
*  Based on photos previously posted on this subreddit it seems they are going with the Rivians again for support vehicles. They didn't seem to have the same range issues as the bikes, and they obviously have a good relationship with the company from Long Way Up. I'm agnostic to this.

If you read to the end - thank you for indulging my ramblings. I had a lot of thoughts about the show that I needed to put into words. I would love to hear any other opinions about Long Way, comments on what I've spoken about or things I didn't get to.

Im F1 student and was wondering as I know we can only work on campus 20 hours with permission during study and then out of uni when graudation with permission.

Am I allowed to declutter my apartnment and sell some used stuff of mine? Like coffee machine, old bed, old books etc on sites like craiglist and get paid either digitally or in person ? Or would that be self employment and illegal, risking my status to stay?

1h0weq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h0weq6/my_33f_best_friend_38m_bailed_on_me_to_socialize/,My (33F) best friend (38M) bailed on me to socialize with my harmful ex (43M) and it upset me that he refused to even acknowledge that I get to have feelings about the situation - AITA? ,"I (33F) have been friends with Jack (38M) for five years now, and we are very close friends (I am friends with him and his wife since they met - we're soul sisters!) and I consider Jack to be one of my few best friends.

About three years ago, when I first moved to my city, alone, sick and in the middle of covid, I met John (43M) and we got into a relationship quick (almost as quickly as it broke off). He used to confirm to me that he considers us partner, but when things got rough he started ghosting me and giving me the cold shoulder. The most hurtful situation was when I had been struggling with my breathing for a while, combined with chest pains and sudden weight loss. I had to go to the ER one night at 3am, and even though I was at his place, I actually ended up going all on my own. Since I left his house, I cried non stop for days. After the 24-hour hospital visit, he started making petty excuses why he didn't want to come over to support me such as ""I don't want to carry 2 laptops on my back (on my walk to your home)"". I understood it was over. He didn't even want to talk about it, I asked for a conversation which was very cold and abrupt. When I remember him now, all I can think about is the harmful emotional imprint in memory of him. He was supposedly my partner, and yet I struggled on my own alone in a new city, he didn't realize what it means to be someone's support system (a new immigrant during covid) that is already going through a lot health-wise, to the point that doctor's were thinking I had cancer, and that was a fear I had to live with on my own.

To this day, when he sees me out and about in the city, he does not even stop to say hello or acknowledge me. Could be shame, or it could be that he genuinely wants nothing to do with me anymore, and I don't care which one is it, but just to say that he is someone that ignores me every time he gets a chance and never once did he talk with me about our time together. Worth to mention that John has a small coffee shop where he hosts events sometimes.

My best friend, Jack, went, one night, to John's coffee place to watch a show which he did not enjoy. He then kept talking about John in an almost impressed tone; how he was nice to him, he took care of him during the night, got him a drink iirc, kept engaging in convos with him and invited him to the following night where another event was taking place. Mind you, Jack and John only met a handful of times and they only got to know each other from me when John and I were together. Now, hearing Jack talk about John in a mesmerized way rang alarm bells in my head a little, because I know that John is a business man, he will say whatever to get you to come back, and Jack is gullible, very gullible, and struggled with letting people walk all over him (either exes, or friends, and this is something his wife and I discuss every once in a while because we don't always like who he surrounds himself with:  people that don't necessarily treat him well, but he will go every time he is invited...).  
The following day, Jack and I were supposed to meet. He was in town (he isn't always in town, so when he is, we try our best to hang out), and told me he will pass by at 6pm.

He then told me he wants to go to John's coffee place at 8pm of the same night, because he gave him his word the night prior and he was too nice with him and he obviously liked spending time with him. I then took some time to explain to him over text how I view John, who he is in my life, the hurt and letting down he did, how he until this day wouldn't even say a word to me (but he would have lengthy intimate nights with my best friend....). I told him this is a person that really harmed me, either by his actions or inactions. I told him I cannot dictate what you should but I want you to know how I feel about all this. He said he will pass by at 6, and then assess how the night will go. And I thought that was fair, when he passes by at 6 we will get a chance to talk more about this.

Of course, midnight strikes and I didn't hear a word from Jack. Not a text, not a call, not a signal that he is no longer coming (I had prepared dinner for all of us by then, assuming he would come).

He calls me the following day at night, and we end up speaking on the phone a couple days after that night. He told me: sorry I didn't come over, I did some work, then went out at around 10pm to ""random restaurant"" (that is 5 minutes near my hourse!) and he met up with John (i.e. he didn't meet with John because he happens to be there in the event, or hosting the event, which I would absolutely understand and never had issues with -- it happened in the past and I never said anything. On the contrary, he did not go to the event, and they met in my local hooka place specifically to hang out with each other -- after he bailed on me). It made me upset: I understand you are gullible, and very kind, and if you told someone you'll be somewhere, then you will, and at first I thought that is why he wanted to go so much. But if that was the case, how about the word he gave me, that he will pass by? Why did he prioritize honoring his word to John, and not me, his close friend?

I was upset over the phone when he told me that and I tried explaining how I feel: like this hurts, this makes me feel that you are not making any value to me, to my heartbreak, to my pain that this person caused. You are not thinking of me when hanging out hooka and drinking with this person who harmed me and never took accountability of their actions towards me. I can't believe how you would sit and laugh and get high with someone who let me down this much, in a time when I suspected I had cancer, when I was breaking down.... You are putting your hands in the hands of a person who harmed me.

During the call he kept doubling down and deflecting. First he told me, why didn't you tell me you would be upset if I saw him? I told him: A) I can't and don't want to control you, B) I thought we would talk about it at 6 and C) I thought you would think of what I told you over text, and not dismiss it entirely. Then he would say ""you can't tell me whom to see or not to see"", to which I said, ""yes! I know that! And that is why I am EXPLAINING to you how I Feel but you are not even listening or acknowledging them. I am telling you this is a person that caused me great damage. If it were me and roles were reversed, I wouldn't go out of my way to socialize with your harmful ex the way you are with John. I would consider my behavior and boundaries even if it was your family or mother that was harming you, let alone an ex! I would think of you, I would think of your story and your pain when I looked into these people.""

To which he asked a question that really threw me off and made me feel a little contempt, he asked ""to what extent did he hurt you?"". I think the question is valid but the timing is horrible. You are asking this now to judge whether I have the right to feel hurt, whether you approve of my feeling of being hurt or not, to figure out whether he can still see him or not.. to which I said, what does it matter? I can explain another time but I am telling you this is a harmful person to me. He kept doubling down and saying: ""I don't have the full picture on how he hurt you and to what extent."" This made me really sad... I am telling you I am hurt, if it were you, I would appreciate your feelings, acknowledge that they are valid even if I don't understand them at this moment and care for you. He clearly didn't...

It wasn't a pleasant call, we both wanted off the phone at the end, I ended with saying: we are close friends, I don't get to tell you who to see or not see, but I should be able to share how I feel with you, or that seeing my harmful ex makes me feel like you are not thinking of me or appreciating my feelings as your best friend. I should be able to tell you that I expect my best friend to think of me -- you can tell me you don't want to carry this responsibility and I will act accordingly, but I believe we SHOULD be able to talk about it! I am very big on open communication. He doesn't understand this, he thinks I am being manipulative. I told him I am trying to explain how these actions make me feel, and that he is free to act how he wants and that actions have meanings and consequences.

TL;DR: my (33F) best friend (38M) bailed on me to socialize with my ex (43M) who was very harmful to me at a time when I was alone and he was considered my only support, but only on paper. I explained to him that it made me feel hurt, but he wouldn't even listen or acknowledge that I get to have feelings in this matter.",2,1732682966.0,AITAH,4,0.67,False

1h0wb79,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1h0wb79/how_do_i_know_if_he_still_likes_me/,How do I know if he still likes me‚Ä¶,"So basically I (19 F) and him (19 M) met a month into this college semester. He was a friend of a friend‚Äôs and he asked me out for coffee after meeting me a few times. After that we went out for food and would go out to parties together on the weekends. He‚Äôs met my friends and I‚Äôve met most of his. 

Thing‚Äôs really escalated the last few weeks when we would hang out like 4 times a week and he would sleep over on the weekends. He kissed me a month after our first ‚Äúdate‚Äù and we had sex a while after. At this point I was very sure that he liked me or at least had interest in me since he was extremely sweet in person and would act all lovey. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when he started acting a little different. He would make plans but cancel last minute because of various reasons that just don‚Äôt make sense. This has happened three times since then. It just feels like he‚Äôs not really making an effort to see me as much as he was before. 

I talked to him about it a week ago and asked him what he wanted and what was going on between us. He said that he does really like me but he wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship (which I wasn‚Äôt either so I was fine with it), and said sorry for making me feel shitty about all this. But I also told him that I‚Äôd like to know if he would want anything in the future soon so I can know what‚Äôs up. 

I thought everything was fine until yesterday it happened again. He said he would come over but ended up not coming because he had assignments due which he just didn‚Äôt finish due to procrastination. Even after he submitted them he said he was too tired to come over since it was late. 

I don‚Äôt know if he even likes me anymore or if I‚Äôm just reading too much into it. Because to me, if you do like someone shouldn‚Äôt you want to spend time with them and would go out of your way to see them?

The resort had a nice play area for kids, which kept them busy and happy. We booked a private pool cottage, and honestly, the pool was the best part of our stay. We spent so much time there, laughing and making fun memories.

The staff were really nice too. The next day, the manager gave us a map showing all the nearby places to visit. It was super helpful, and we ended up exploring a lot of beautiful spots we didn‚Äôt know about.

Those three days in Wayanad were amazing. Between the caves, the pool, and all the sightseeing, it was a perfect family trip. We‚Äôll definitely cherish the memories for a long time!

1h0w433,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTheorists/comments/1h0w433/a_very_scuffed_fnaf_theory/,A Very Scuffed Fnaf Theory,"Forgive this rambling of the highest order, but I have way too much going through my mind when it comes to FNAF.

Firstly FNAF World. This is a game that has been barely scratched when it comes to Theorizing, only really being payed attention to recently thanks to Ryetoast and his FNAF 3 connections and the whole Happiest Day set-up theory. However, I don't fully buy it. Sure, the evidence is really, really good, and in much of the video, I hesitate to argue. However, it's really what he doesn't mention that breaks it for me. 

The Majority of his evidence for said theory is from the Clock ending, which is definitely important, and I agree with the majority. However, my question is what about everyone else? What about Animdude, or Chipper, or Coffee, Souldozer, Purplegeist, and Scott literally being in the game? 

Now, some of those could be reasonably dismissed, as Coffee and Souldozer definitely have the robotic characteristics that many FNAF characters have, and you could even argue that Chipper has the Animatronic nature, and Purplegeist might be the kids making fun of Afton. However, Animdude should not be here if this is what FNAF world is about. Animdude is the signature avatar for Scott, who also appears in the game via FNAF 57, so where did these guys come from?

I'll be honest, I don't have an answer. Maybe, in this universe, the game developer literally made the same games as Scott, and said developer did exactly what Scott complains about in FNAF world? Maybe I'm just reading too much into it (Imagine that for a FNAF Theorist) but it just stays on my mind.

Also, remember that the Demo version of FNAF world was completely different from the end-product. It was maybe half-an-hour long, with only three characters in a party of one. The Halloween world literally contains many of the enemies from the DEMO, including Purplegeist, albeit with a big change.

Also, what's up with the Universe End? I think that literally has to be just a funny easter egg ending, but I can't discount anything.

Secondly, the deal with the Shadow animatronics. Most people target Shadow Bonnie, RXQ, RWQ, whatever the heck their name is, and for good reason. RXQ has the most appearances and the most info we have compared to their Bear counterpart, who has barely appeared, last physically appearing in 6. Anyway, RWQ is like, this guardian of Shadow Remnant in AR, he's this effervescent character in 3 where he's able to traverse the multiple arcade games like it's wreck-it-ralph, and clearly he's important enough to appear in Afton's Hell of UCN, despite every other game in the series to miss at least one from its roster. Shadow Freddy on the other hand, is very strange considering he seems to be a chessmaster. He leads the MCI to the backrooms, only for them to be dismantled by Afton later. Then night 5 comes, and you all know the drill. Clearly, unless the minigames are lying, the MCI were lead by Shadow freddy to the backroom, with RWQ also appearing in the fourth night game. 

They feel like arbiters, something other power watching over these catastrophes, kind of like long horse from trevor henderson. Shadow Freddy leads the FNAF 1 crew to their dismantling, only for their ghosts to lead Afton to his demise. Meanwhile, RWQ seems to be, similar to what Ryetoast suggested about FNAF world, setting up the happiest day and the children's spirits being freed.

They're watchers. That's what the Shadow Animatronics are. That's why Shadow Freddy simply appears to Michael's left in Fnaf 3. He just watches. That's all they do when they're seen by people. 2, 3, and UCN. In the game systems, they're guardians. They set up the happiest day, and they set up these children's release.

AR kind of ruins this a little bit, but not alot. AR only features RWQ, but he's seen as a guardian of the shadow remnant, which tracks with what I was saying. If remnant is, essentially, souls merged with metal, of course he's protecting the remnant.

Thirdly, and most importantly that has the least answers, did everyone forget about the second part of the Game developer line from Help wanted?

""*Fazbear Entertainment hired the game developer. Those indie games were designed to conceal and* ***make light*** *of what happened*.""

""**Make Light.""**

What the heck happened that made child murder, animatronic possession, springlock deaths, literal children dragging their killer to their own personal hell, and countless nightguard deaths **LIGHT** **IN COMPARISON**?

I wear a fitbit to bed and even with 7-8 hrs, my deep sleep never exceeds 2hrs (REM is 1hr, 30 min) so even when I do get sleep, the quality is terrible.

I will be in SD from mid-December through February. I am looking to make a career change, and would like to spend a lot of time coding (sometimes in a coffee shop). More importantly, I care a decent amount about walkability and nightlife, but I will have a car. I also would like to enjoy the beaches while I am there, check out the breweries, and sometimes on the weekend drive out to see fun SD stuff (the zoo, and idk what else). 

  
So in order of priority, it would be coding/coffeeshop/convenience vibe, followed by nightlife, followed by beaches, and then somewhat having access to the rest of SD. 

  
It seems like North Park would be a great fit, but I haven't yet found a 1 BR under my budget of 2,300. 

  
So right now, I am deciding between being a couple miles east in City Heights (right next to Tejada's Peruvian Kitchen) or Little Italy, right on the border between that, Harborview, and Bankers Hill under the freeway. 

  
Does anyone have any thoughts on this choice, or other places I should look? ",2,1732681514.0,Moving2SanDiego,5,0.75,False
