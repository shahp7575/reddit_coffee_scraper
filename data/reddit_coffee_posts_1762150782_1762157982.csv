The leadership emphasized their commitment to enhancing shareholder value while addressing market feedback and operational challenges faced during recent quarters. Key insights included growth prospects in the coffee category and the strengths of both businesses.

Key Highlights:

2. The acquisition of JDE Peet's aims to create a global coffee powerhouse, with expected synergies of $400 million over three years to enhance profitability and operational efficiency.

3. Both Global Coffee Co and Beverage Co are projected to maintain strong cash flow generation, with estimates of over $5 billion for each segment from 2026 to 2028.

4. Leadership remains confident in the strategic rationale behind separating the two companies, allowing for focused management and tailored strategies that can optimize performance in their respective markets.

2. Pay attention to consumer response to upcoming product innovations, particularly within the coffee segment, which could signal future growth trends and adjustments needed in strategy.

Overall, KDP is poised for a transformative phase that leverages its core strengths while adapting to changing market dynamics.

Ever feel like you're stuck in second gear? Like you're doing *okay*, but you know there's a more energized, focused, and fulfilled version of you waiting to be unlocked? I've been there. It's not about a massive, dramatic life overhaul. It's about small hinges that swing big doors.

Let's talk about some simple stuff that's made a huge difference for me.

**It starts with tiny, almost ""stupidly small"" habits:**

*   **The 5-Minute Win:** Forget the crazy 5 AM, 12-step morning routine if it's not for you. Just commit to *one* positive thing for 5 minutes before you touch your phone. Stretch, meditate, write one sentence in a journal, or just sit with your coffee in silence. It sets a powerful intention for the day.
*   **Reclaim the Gaps:** The 10 minutes before a meeting, the time you're waiting for the microwave, the commute. Instead of defaulting to a doom-scroll, use that time. Listen to a chapter of an audiobook, do a quick breathing exercise, or text someone you care about. These little moments add up.

**Then, move on to smarter optimization:**

I used to be obsessed with time management, but a huge shift happened when I started focusing on **Energy Management** instead.

Ask yourself: What gives me energy vs. what drains it?

I did a quick audit and was shocked. 30 minutes of arguing with a stranger online drained me more than a 2-hour workout. 15 minutes of watching cable news made me feel more tired than a full day of deep work.

Optimizing your life means optimizing your *inputs*. What are you feeding your mind? Is it fuel that helps you thrive, or junk that leaves you feeling sluggish? 🚀

Of course, all the productivity hacks in the world don't mean much if your inner world is chaotic. A huge part of thriving is getting your mindset and emotional foundation solid. Honestly, it's the part that's hardest to ""hack."" If you're feeling stuck in a loop or overwhelmed with where to even start, getting a structured plan can make all the difference. I found a lot of clarity for that side of things using **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to help map out my emotional goals.

It's a journey, not a destination. We're all just trying to get that 1% better every day.

So, what's one simple habit or optimization tip that's genuinely working for you right now? Let's share some ideas. 👇",1,1762156794.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1on5xbc,https://i.redd.it/tf2k4xg300zf1.jpeg,How to Design a Button in Carrd That Looks 3D and Feels Premium,"You ever notice how some buttons look so good you kinda want to press them just to see what happens?

Yeah, this is one of those buttons.
Here’s how to recreate it 👇

1. Base Style:

Set your button to solid and add both a label + icon, the combo gives it that modern, app-like vibe.

2. Colors:

Background: #E9DFD2 (warm, soft tone, like coffee with just the right amount of milk)

Hover: #FFFFFF (because nothing says “click me” like pure white)

3. Gradient:

• Color → #FFFFFF

• Angle → 0°

• Stop 1 → 0% 

• Stop 2 → 100%

Basically… it’s not really a gradient, it’s a lie for depth.
Label/Text: #000000 (keep it bold and legible)

4. Border:

• Color: #FFFFFF

• Width: 3

• Style: solid

A crisp white border keeps the button framed and visually distinct.

5. Drop Shadow:

Add a drop shadow with:

• Color: #00000040

• Angle: 90

• Size: 0.125

• Distance: 0.375

• Blur: 0

It gives the button a subtle lift without overdoing it.

6. Responsiveness: 

You can adjust button width, height, icon size, and text size to your preferences for both desktop and mobile.
This ensures your button looks perfect on every screen.

I maybe made the mistake of saying that I am a more traditional girl. I also have a 3 year old daughter from my past relationship so I guess he really saw me as “wife material” however recently it’s been getting a bit too much. 

although I only work 2 shifts a week my full time job is being a mum as I can’t get my daughter minded enough to work full time. He on the other hand does work a lot and it’s brought this dynamic into our relationship very quickly that he is the provider. Don’t get me wrong that is my dream, to have a husband that can provide for me. But it’s got to the point where he’s using the fact he works against me, i told him from the very start i never expected him to help out with money or my daughter, he does and i really appreciate it but does that mean i need to repay him by being a house wife? 

If im gone all day he won’t make himself food and he’ll want me to make him dinner when i’m home. He also relies on me to wake him up in the morning, make his coffee. on top of all this i obviously do his washing and deal with my daughter’s needs at the same time. Sometimes it feels like i’ve suddenly been jolted into having 2 kids. Unfortunately because he doesn’t see parenting as a job or even something difficult it’s hard when i express that i’m overwhelmed or that im not his mum and i won’t be waking him up every 10 mins for work. 

I do really love him he is an amazing person I just don’t want these gender roles to be a problem, after a bad relationship with my ex i’m so much more careful how i allow myself to be treated. Any advice for me :(( ",1,1762156398.0,boyfriends,1,1.0,False

What
(Prologue)



A woman exited a coffee house wearing a laptop bag. A few feet to her right, a purring stray cat jumped into a dumpster to look for scraps. A cabbie on the road cursed loudly in anguish for his favorite team had suffered a loss. A moment later, the bag fell to the ground with a loud thud and the sound of breakage, the taxi rear ended the station wagon directly before it, and the purrs were heard no longer.

'An invisible shadow', some called it. You saw it one moment, no one saw you the next. But the shadow...the shadow lingered still. 

*An indefinite period of time passes*

She was 33 now, with weary eyes that held the weight of a thousand years of war, though she had not seen one battle that others knew of. On paper, you might call her successful, mayhap even enviable. But her success was naught but empty fulfilment. But there had once been a time where she knew true unfleeting joy.

For the longest time, she had held out hope that there was something for her in life beyond the transient comforts of an expensive car and a corner office. Just when she had all but given up, she found what she always desired. He pushed her to go back to her parents again and reignite old bonds. For the first time in her entire life, she had found someone like her. And together, they were stronger. Until it came and everything fell apart all over again. 

He was the first one gone, albeit differently—his vanishing was the only one visible to all, a trait that was not shared with future victims who simply disappeared without a trace in no more than half a moment. Horrified on-lookers watched him be engulfed by a shadow which they perceived as black in color. A pallor of silent quietude had fallen upon the land since it came. 

No one could face it. After all, how could you face something your eyes failed to grasp. Further, you wouldn't have aught to do to resist it. It would've been a fool's move, had anyone before her attempted it. 

The day her parents disappeared was the day she found herself half lying on the couch with red eyes, toying with an idea that many have faced. But something in her had gotten her this far, and that something wasn't going to relent. She tossed the idea away and let out a silent scream, but it relieved her not. A notion struck her all of a sudden and she yelled for it to take her. She turned around to face, yes face, was a black abyss, devoid of...well anything really.

I went in thinking, “Okay, I know what happens. I’ll be chill this time.” Five episodes later I’m pacing around my room like I owe Saul Goodman money😂😂

And ***Jesse***… absolute king of accidental chaos (I love him)

One minute he’s goofing around saying “***yo***,” next minute he’s crying in a car and I’m crying with him like we both failed life’s chemistry exam. Protect that man at all costs😭

Saul? If my lawyer doesn’t pop up like a raccoon in a flashy suit with solutions nobody asked for, I don’t want him.

Mike walks in and suddenly everyone sits up straight like the school principal just entered. He says three words and somehow it feels like life advice. He could say “use turn signals” and I'd change my whole lifestyle.

A box cutter? Stress. A bell? Pure trauma. A plate shard?? Instant panic.

This show ruined household items for me lol.

1on5nv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1on5nv7/at_28_i_finally_realized_that_real_life_is/,"At 28, I finally realized that real life is inherently mundane and disappointing at best and downright terrifying and nightmarish at worst","Last year or two has been pretty rough on me. Chronic illness diagnosis, parents falling to illnesses, chronic loneliness (since 8), and quarter-life crisis hitting me like a truck...... You name it.

I grew up with very controlling, overprotective, sheltering, and strict parents. No friends, no dates, bullied at school, binge-eating disorder, never rebelled, never formed an identity, and pretty much missed out on every formative experience and milestone a human is supposed to have during their teenage years.

Growing up, I pretty much lived in the future to cope with the suck. ""One day in the future, I will finally be able to escape the repressive rut and live an adventurous and exciting life to the fullest"", I used to tell myself. ""I will have a cool crowd of friends, a cute (she doesn't even have to be hot) girlfriend, and a cool life filled with adventures. I will make up for the lost time the universe robbed from me during my teenage and young adult years"".

But that never happened. While I did get my career nailed down and got to embark on a lucrative IT career (thanks to my parents and education), life became work-eat-sleep-repeat. Zero friends. Zero extracurricular activities. Zero interaction with women (except for polite exchanges with the cashier or professional discussions with several woman coworkers I work with who are all at least 15 years older than me).

Do you know they have a saying in Mandarin? 兩點一線. Translated literally as ""two dots one line"", it describes a life where one travels between only home and work (two dots) without going to other places (hence the one line, aka the one path only between home and work). This saying describes my life perfectly.

I have always longed for adventure since childhood, and I've always loved to watch other people's lives on social media and YouTube. Personally, my favorite has been Shiey and Logan Paul. But the more I lived, the more I realized that in the end, there is no adventure in our perfectly mundane and disappointing existence.

There is no Hogwarts ticket coming your way. There is no Gandalf, let alone some Isekai bullshit. Even the so-called adventurous and fun lives I see people post on social media are mostly that, posts carefully curated to sell you a dream and unrealistic expectations of a better and more exciting existence. The travels, parties, relationships, adventures, fun escapades, and such? All is not real and made up. Instead, just like me, they live perfectly mundane and disappointing lives and grapple with terrifying and nightmarish curveballs life throws in every person's way sooner or later (illnesses and such).

I've finally learnt to appreciate the small things: a bottle of Zero Coke, a warm bento after work, a cool or funny post from social media after a lonely day of work. Although I know that social media is not real, I still relish in the dream that it is real. After all, social media sells you a dream of a better existence. Same for books, movies, games, anime, and all sorts of fiction that we humans produce and consume.

For all these years, I've always asked myself. Is this my life? My mundane, joyless, disappointing existence... is there all it is? Where's the adventure? The excitement? The relationships? The adrenaline rush? But now I've come to realize that real life isn't a novel, movie or video game where the main character is destined for an adventure. No. Instead, real life is inherently mundane and disappointing, and that is exactly why fiction and escapism have existed since antiquity, when we talked of legendary demigods and heroes going on adventures and performing feats that are impossible in real life.

It is a very humbling and grounding realization that work-eat-sleep-repeat is the default for all of us humans, and that there is no grander adventure or fun that awaits us other than the terrifying curveballs life likes to occasionally throw our way. As for the loneliness, FOMO since childhood, and restlessness of feeling that I'm not living life to the fullest? Unfortunately, that is also the nature of real life.

There are no grand childhood escapedes where you and your childhood friends sneak into places you aren't supposed to go to; there are no mischevious teenage adventures where you make out with your teenage girlfriend who deliberately dressed up in an extra skimpy outfit just for you in an abandoned building while you drink beer and count the stars; there are no cool friendships of where you and your comrades go explore the most remote and uninhabited regions in the world; hell, there aren't even fun parties where you can laugh away at your hearts content while you fumblingly attemp to impress your giggling crush with the latest magic trick you've learnt online.

None, those are dreams and unrealistic expectations only that are sold to us via social media and fiction. What is in reality is instead acceptance of the mundane and disappointing nature of life while making peace and finding contentment in it by finding joy in the mundane through the small things we have in life.

Eliza stood under the brilliance of moonlight I’d never before seen. It was like the moon itself had bled into the ground before me. Moment by moment the light faded away, seemingly soaked directly into Elize herself. She lay there moaning and writhing on the lawn in rhythmic patterns. The grass began to darken beneath her. The effect spread around her in chaotic form. She was still singing her song, just barely above a whisper now. Even so, its debilitating effect was no less potent.

I pushed myself to be as close to her as possible. Inch by inch I made my way to her. She started to laugh out loud. It sounded like she was both right next to my ear and miles away at the same time. As I neared her, I could see patches of rough light begin to form under her skin. They moved around together in her body like a school of fish. Each second they wrapped around her seemed to intensify the light.

Her laughter was joyful, childish even. As the light grew in volume bits and pieces of her began to lift into the air. Soon more and more of her was broken and left floating in the space before me. I remember crying out into the cool night air. I had tears running down my cheeks. I don’t know how long the process took. I lost semi-consciousness three, maybe four times again. Each time I did, the flashes of images came just a little bit closer to being real.

Eventually, I looked upon her for one last time. She laid there before me suspended in various stages of disconnection. Her body seemed to be merely illuminated paper strips floating on the wind. Then, bit by bit, they began to burn away into the sky. Small bits of ashen light flowed around her. With a harrowing unnatural groan of pressurized air, the scene was blown apart. There was nothing left of my Eliza. All I had left of my wonderful wife was the blackened spot where had laid outside on the grass.

I mean that too, that was the last thing I had from her. I spent hours outside on that lawn, well into the next day trying to piece together what happened. It wasn’t until I went inside that I began to notice the changes. At first, It was small things like missing jewelry or clothes. Then it became apparent that I had no pictures of Eliza left. Not the ones that were hanging up, nor the ones in our album.

I ran frantically throughout our house. Everywhere I looked, any evidence of my wife had seemingly left along with her. Shoes, makeup, clothes, even her damned coffee cup were just gone. I think I went insane for a moment. The first of many after that day. I collected myself enough to talk to anyone I could. I looked everywhere for help, asked every question I could. Each and every time, the same result always came through.

People would listen to me, then after a few minutes, they would just greet me again as if I had only just arrived. Not a single person could remember who Eliza was, nor keep any sense of focus on what I was saying about her. I even forced a friend of hers down once, made her listen to me for hours on end about Eliza. Even then, after all the ugly things I did to her, she came around to this black state once again as we never talked about her once. She even thanked me for helping her out of the dingy little tool shed she had found herself in. I nearly gave up on life itself after that one. To the point that I even went home to shoot myself in the head, anything to make the whole damn nightmare just end.

Do you know the god-awful ugly joke of that? I bought the gun years ago, but Eliza had been the one to buy the bullets for it when I asked her to pick them up. So, as with anything else of hers, they too were but a madman’s memory. I think I destroyed half of my damn house that night in a blinding rage.

For the next few weeks, I did my best to work through it all. I actually made myself believe that she never existed, that the real issue was the woman I had invented. I forced myself to fully buy into the notion that the love of my life was merely a delusional concept. Months later, I was able to go to work properly. No one even seemed to notice that the store had been closed for so long. Not a single question from a soul. Life had gone back to some fetid form of normalcy. All it took was breaking down my own mind and losing it over and over again until I couldn’t fight the crazy anymore.

That was until a few days ago when that damned static came through on the radio again. Just like before back at that place. I can’t ignore this noise around me. I don’t know what it is. I have my own theories, but I gave up on understanding it all a long time ago. One thing I am positive of is the feeling sitting just at the edge of my stomach. It’s the kind of thing you learn to trust in the Military. This feeling stirs deep inside of you as if it can sense the knife’s tip coming right up behind you. You know that something out there is hungering for your life. Right now, that feeling is tenfold on me. I know something is wrong, I just can’t understand it. In truth, I don’t want to either. Now, you know the same crazy that I know, son.

With his story concluded, Mr. Hartcliff seemed to close up mentally for a moment letting a few tears loose. There was a sense of release about the man mixed into his fear and worry. I supposed that being able to share his story with someone able to listen to it had its merits.

If his story was true, I could not imagine the near mental torture that he would have endured. Then again, that was the real crux of it for me at this point. Did I really believe the insane story he had unloaded on me? Honestly, how in the hell could I? I was every bit the fantastical flight of a madman’s fiction. The thought did cross my mind that perhaps he murdered his own wife and created this work of fiction to deal with his grief and remorse. Then again, there were far too many other overreaching oddities to simply brush him off.

The sounds on the radio, the way people seemed to just pass over them as nothing happened. Then there were the nights of restless dreaming I had experienced. They sounded eerily close to what Mr. Hartcliff had detailed.

We both sat in still silence for a moment before he spoke up. He knew that it would take time for me to really process what he told me. We talked about what to do, how to proceed with our days. His only advice at the moment was to keep my head low and hope it would all blow over. When I asked him what he would do, he looked away and chewed his lower lip, mulling the response over. “I’m going to take a drive” is all he said back to me.

He asked that I go downstairs and tend to the shop for a while. I did as he asked, it was a slow day after that. No one came in and everything had been counted over a few times already. About an hour after our conversation, Mr. Hartcliff came down with a few heavily packed duffle bags. He grabbed his hat from behind the counter and left the store keys by the register. He stopped to grab a soda from the front and took a large mouthful before throwing it in the trash.

I asked him if he was heading out. He replied he was going to take that drive. With a nod he pointed to the keys by the register, telling me to lock up tight as he would be out late. A few seconds of smiling and silence later he was out the door and in his truck. A bit more and he was down the road and gone. That was the last time I ever saw Mr. Hartcliff. I wish I had known it back then. I wanted to ask him so much more, help him if I could. Yet, such is the handicap of hindsight. It’s only in the present that we can accept the past and it’s only in the future that we can appreciate it. In the present, it’s just moments of choices waiting to play out. Maybe you make the right one, maybe the wrong one, or maybe none of your options mattered in the first place. Funny thing is that even the good choices can lead to the worst outcomes.

The rest of my day after Mr. Hartcliff’s departure was a tedious affair. I spent most of it staring out into the street wondering if Mrs. Calloway would show up at the pharmacy. As the evening set in, I gave up on seeing her that day. Nothing else happened until right about 20 minutes to closing time. That’s when the radio came on. You see, the crazy thing about it was that I did not have it plugged in. It was not a battery-operated model either. Even so, it was on and playing a low and sweet melody through a patchy bit of static.

I backed away from the radio at first, not knowing what to do. I was so tired at that point, I considered it was just something in my head. I found a bit of resolve and forced myself to handle it. I gritted my teeth and moved to shut off the radio. With a shaky hand, I reached out for the power knob. No matter how many times I turned the knob to the off position, it wouldn’t stop. Out of frustration, and admittedly some fear as well, I took the radio and threw it in the upstairs attic. I ran down the stairs and locked the doors to the shop as quickly as I could, fumbling with the lock the entire time.

I was breathing heavily as I backed away from the shop. Some people took notice of me, but I just smiled and waved them on. Not knowing what to do, I ran down to the high school hoping to see my father. I needed somewhere to be, someplace that felt normal. On the way, I passed by the diner. The smell of cheap steaks and fries filled the evening air. Suddenly it hit me how hungry I was. Crazy how you can just forget to eat like that. I stopped to contemplate picking up a plate to go. I thought that maybe all I really needed was a good rest and something decent in my stomach. Maybe for just a moment, I could push away the nonsense of that damn static.

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I tried my absolute best to just think normal for a bit. That didn’t last long. I felt a hand on my shoulder, large and heavy. I turned around and spotted none other than Mr. Calloway himself. An imposing brute of man on stature alone. I could never out-fight him.

I thought that was it right there. I would be beaten to death in front of the diner that night and everyone would know why. Part of me even wanted to take the beating. After all, it was his wife I was sleeping with. I braced myself for what I thought would be a deadly haymaker coming in. Instead, he looked me in the eyes and simply asked if I had seen his wife.

Mr. Calloway’s eyes were tired and worn. He looked down at me with a low face. He was a man who had been through something hard recently. Maybe he did know about me and his wife, or maybe not. Either way, he was hurting. He told me that he had not seen her for a few days. He said she didn’t take anything. Her clothes, shoes, car, all of it was just sitting there at the house. I told him that she didn’t seem to show up to work today. In fact, the pharmacy didn’t even open today at all.

He said he noticed; he had been there a few times already. He thanked me for my time and went into the diner to inquire about her. Something about meeting him face to face like that. It was like being dragged along the coals with my sins in tow. It had been a fun affair, but seeing him like that made it too real. See, that’s what hindsight gets you. Knowledge of your failure, just far too late to fix anything. You can say that it helps in moving forward, but it does nothing for the wrecks you already burned through.

I decided against getting a meal that night. My appetite left me somewhere in Mr. Calloway’s sad eyes. I made my way towards the high school, hoping to lose myself somewhere in that walk. The snow was coming in a bit thicker this night. Each step began to be more work. The wind picked up a bit, then a bit more. A cold bite found its way on my face and ears. I cursed myself for leaving my hat coat at the store that night.

Then, there for a brief moment, I felt the touch of a hand on my leg. I nearly jumped right out of the snow. I looked around frantically. I knew something was there, I felt the grip on my jeans. Whatever I was, I could not see it. I don’t know if I wanted to really find whatever it was. I started to run as hard as I could through the snow. Hoping that if I just push through, I could make it to the school without incident.

I would not be so lucky. As I ran, within a few horrible moments the area became unfamiliar to me. A route that I had walked for over the past 17 years that I knew like the back of my hand had become alien to me. There were branching paths I had never seen before. Trees of odd growth and flowers that had these strange vibrant colors appeared next to me. In a fluid and sickening motion, the snow around me seemed to collide and fade into a vast ocean before me. I could no longer feel the bite of the cold. Instead, an intense wave of heat rolled in from the crashing waves. A pungent scent of blood filled my nose. The sound of rocks crumbling and skittering plates came from behind me. I looked at the source and saw a colossal lobster-like creature of wild design descending from a cliffside. I heard my name called out from somewhere. Looking around I spotted someone further down the beach. I don’t know how to properly describe what I was seeing. If my eyes were being honest, it looked like Mrs. Calloway. Only, it wasn’t her.

The thing had her features, but they were all wrong. Her body seemed to heave and sway with these jerky movements. Her arms were elongated and ended with massive white pincers. The worst part was her smile. Her face seemed so perfectly happy. Something small and red fell from her lips as she got closer. Then I could tell she was not simply walking towards me but running with an odd gait as if one leg was not the same length as the other now. She laughed as she did. The sound echoed in my ears. It started to hurt all over.

Without a doubt, I was in the grips of fear. Yet, even so, I could remember feeling something else. Maybe sadness or longing. It didn’t matter. I thought my life was ending for a second time that night.

Suddenly, the whole ordeal seemed to be over nearly as soon as it started. I found myself right at the high school’s entrance with a fresh layer of snow on me. With a fresh core of fear still within, I ran up the stairs and through the double doors as quickly as I could. I slid down against a wall, trying with all my intact sanity to understand what I had seen. So much of me wanted to provide clear cut logical answers to the event. Instead, I just went crazier with each passing moment that I thought about it.

I must have zoned out at some point. I looked up to see my father standing over me offering his hand. There were a few other people around as well. Seemingly someone had gone to get him after finding me a wreck on the floor. He offered some excuse for them. Something about being tired from work.

I remember driving home with him that night. He offered to stop to get something to eat at the diner again. Thinking about Mr. Calloway, and in turn Mrs. Calloway, I declined. I wanted to be home with the doors locked right away. Dad and I sat by the TV nearly all night. I tried everything I could think of to stay up that night. At some point, I did fall asleep. As before, the strange dreams came again. Only this time, I wasn’t on some strange beach.

Instead, I was now walking through a wooded area coming up to a building. It was a run-down derelict of a place. I saw myself cut the tape on the doors and pry them open. Stepping in, I made my way through various debris. Reaching into a duffle bag, I pulled out a set of wire cutters to clear away sets of chains placed on a door. Looking at my hands as they worked, it became apparent to me that this was not me. I recognized that bag and the hands. This was Mr. Hartcliff. How or why I was seeing this was a mystery to me, but somehow, I knew it was real.

The dream went on with Mr. Hartcliff moving further into the ruined building, turning on a flashlight as he looked around. Making his way under a broken steel beam, he found a thin door that led into a strange glass-covered area. There, behind another set of locked doors, was a young woman sitting at a dusty table. It was hard to make out all of her features, but I could see her brilliant eyes clearly. The color of both her hair and eyes seemed to shift and alter as she sat there. One moment she was a redhead with brown eyes and the next a blonde with green eyes. Whatever the color, it was always a radiant force on display in the low light.

In the dream, I felt Hartcliff’s rage, sorrow, and remorse pour out into that room. He wanted to kill the woman, burn the place down, and go along with it. Yet, another part of him just wanted to go home and hold Eliza as she slept in bed. Caressing her hair as she lay on his chest snoring the night away. I could feel the absolute love he had for her as if it were my own. The woman in the room rose up from the table and made her way towards the door. There in the fading bit of light afforded by Harfcliff’s flashlight, I could see her…no, I could see it.

The girl was only so in fleeting human elements. Up close I could see that she moved on what appeared to be a long fleshy limb akin to a snake or snail maybe. Her arms were both equally alien and as colorful in spots as her hair. Her head and eyes seemed to be the most human in nature but only in residual forms. The closer she came to the doors, the more difficult it was to look at her.

Mr. Hartcliff pointed the gun at her. Both of them knew that the bullet would never get through the door, but he felt better aiming it at her. In his own mind, if he wasn’t aiming it at her, he would be aiming it at himself. I could feel the rush of ideas going through his head. Things he wanted to do to the creature before him. Things he wished he had done before Eliza left. Yet, one thing above all came to mind. He wanted to know why. Why did Eliza have to go, what happened that night?

With a sly and almost cocky smile, the creature seemed to beckon Hartcliff to come closer, right next to the door. I felt myself resist as he stepped forward, closer and closer to that thing. As he approached, the thing slid a small sliver of itself through a minuscule opening above the door. The tiny fleshy section dripped out of the opening and traveled down on what seemed like nerve endings from the creature.

The bit touched Hartcliff on the shoulder and moved with a violent rush towards his ear. It seemed to melt into a spot just behind his left ear and branch out into his skull. Or at the least, that’s what it felt like in the dream. I keep calling it that, I know it was more than just a dream. Yet, even so, it was so surreal that I can’t help but relate it in that sense.

When the little piece of her..it, finished moving itself into Hartcliff’s head, the dream became something more. Within the span of an instant I could see what she did. I knew what she knew. I was, for a brief and horrifying moment, fitted within the space of her mind.

Her race, if it was not wholly apparent already, was alien to our world. They were an all-female species. Each and every one tried to reproduce, pass on genetics, with whatever was available. The people in their world feared and worshipped them. I had witnessed memories where this thing had moved through ten-meter-high velvet black grass, arms outstretched with hungering claws. I saw as she took apart something that looked nearly human. The thing cried out in horror as it was torn apart, consumed to the bone with a gut-wrenching joyfulness.

She enjoyed the thrill of the hunt, the rending of flesh, and all the sensations it brought out in those around her. Through her link, I could feel the ripples of pleasure she thrived in as the other human-like creatures cried and broke down in her presence. She could even feel the rolling hatred from some while others fell to their knees in prayer to her. Each and every act, all of it, brought her some sort of entangled mental nourishment.

These creatures, whatever they are, dominate the mind in strange ways. I could see how she would entrance some of the male creatures to lay with her. She had her favorites among the tribal populace she feasted upon. Some seemed to be offered as a sacrifice from villages. The creature took an odd carnal enjoyment from the sexual act, but it was more than just flesh to flesh. She would take something from these males. Some sort of glowing extraction. She would store this deep within her. Even with the connection, I could scarcely make out what the essence was or what it was for. More accurately, I was simply too alien for me to understand.

There was more as well. Sometimes the creature others like her would take the females as well. Soft hissing whispers into hot winds would lure out the women from villages. I watched as the thing stalked from a high perch in what appeared to be oddly organic trees.",1,1762155376.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

People say It’s good to get the truth out there, off your chest and into the wild. That’s what I want to do now, while I still can.

I wrote most of this down quite some time ago and to be honest, I left a lot of lies thrown about the whole thing. Some small, some large, some just enough in between to make the rest stick. Yet, knowing what I know and feeling like I feel…it’s about time to put it down again proper with the honest truth laid bare no matter who gets hurt.

Lord knows plenty of people have already been hurt by me. Maybe not directly, but guilt carries its aim with a true and deft eye. I ran far, hid in another life, tried to forget it; but even after all these years, I cannot drop these chains on my soul. They rattle and creak in the lonely hours of the night reminding me nightly of those shameful sins. More than once, I’ve felt far too akin to the old ghost of Marley.

I cower in disgust of the long life I’ve lived. I should have stayed, said something more, tried something more, anything but what I did. I pretend as if those screams were just dogs baying in the night. I acted as if I forgot the way to that old place. As if the right turn off of Olive Avenue didn’t exist.

If you’re hearing or reading this now, then the good doctor received my letters. He has put the truth out there. I rightly reckon that many of the eyes and ears that it graces will simply ignore the matter. Maybe even much less pay rightful heed to any of it. I can’t say I blame anyone for doing that. It’s easier to just say things like this don’t happen, or don’t exist. Yet, I can assure you that there is full truth in what I have to say. It’s not brought about by a mind filled with booze or aged illness. The memories of that place are deadlocked into crystal clarity at the forefront of my mind. Every empty moment I find, they fill with sorrowful remorse and echoing terror.

With the time that is left, let me tell you all that I can about the Bradwells radio station. Many people won’t know the name and less, I assume, even where it was. It wasn’t exactly a place that was open for the public after all. The station was in Georgia, or at least part of it was. I lived in a small town close by called Blairsville back then. It was a good place, probably still is. I haven’t been back there in decades, not since it all happened.

It was right near the end of 1965. A cold November air had already well and set down across the land. I had just turned 20 the day before. I can even remember bits and pieces of the party. My mother had long since passed back when we used to live in London. Even so, my father always made sure to make any occasion feel like she was still with us. He could not cook a damn thing, yet somehow managed to bake a cake that was marginally edible. The effort was heartwarming. We laughed at the burned sludge that he called a cake. He gave me a beer and we relaxed on the deck staring at the stars, wondering which one mom had decided to call home. Damn, I miss those times.

It had been an interesting year already. A man had walked outside in space, and then another right on the moon itself. Two of my friends, Eric and Charles, both died in Vietnam. I got my first real job at the hardware store downtown. I even lost my virginity to the married woman that worked at the pharmacy across from there. College was something I had considered but was still up in the air for a lot of reasons. I thought I had crossed over into my true adult life. I felt as if I was ready to handle what the world would throw at me. Yet, the next few weeks would leave me a mess of a man before the year’s end.

It was the second week of the month; a decent snowfall had already come through the town. That particular morning, we noticed a strange issue with the radio on the way in. For about a good ten minutes, there was nothing but static all across the bands. Not a single signal was coming in strong. We talked about it, even made a joke that it was the Russians somehow. It cleared up soon enough and we just forgot about it as the day went on.

Dad dropped me off at the hardware store and went on ahead to the school where he worked as a coach. He loved that job and it loved him back. As he drove off, I saw Mrs. Calloway waving at me from across the street. She was a full eight years my senior and was none too shy about showing me the carnal ropes with her experience. Looking back on it, I do feel remorse for being the “other” man. Yet, even with hindsight, I can’t say my hormone-driven body would have acted any differently. That brief week or so of romantic encounters with her had me thinking I was some kind of something. It filled me with this idiot’s pride and fool’s courage. As if I was somehow more than I was simply because I could aim and point with my dick.

I spent that day working with thoughts of a lusty midnight rendezvous with Mrs. Calloway pushing me to ensure I didn’t have to work late. Yet, as things tend to happen, I did end up working later than expected due to a huge spill of parts in the store. Two kids had run in and done a number on the shelves for fun. I let my dad know I would catch a ride out later on, (hoping it would be with Mrs. Calloway), and not to worry.

As we worked, the store owner, Mr. Hartcliff, turned on the radio so we could work with some music. The tunes came out pretty well for a few minutes, but then we suddenly got the static issue again. Just as before it was on all bands. However, unlike before, we did hear something besides static. For just a few seconds, in a faint almost dreamlike tone, the sound of a woman whispering came through. At that time, I could not make out what she was saying, but it definitely sounded like a woman.

Within moments it was done and the static faded back into some great rock music. I turned to look at Mr. Hartcliff to ask if he had heard the voice as well. He said it must be something wrong with the radio stations, songs mixing together, or something like that. He hurried off to finish counting the spilled inventory muttering about snot-nosed brats. We left the matter alone and finished cleaning up. It stuck in my head as I swept the floor. Every now and then I found myself hoping it would happen again so I could make out what the voice was whispering.

Nightfall came and we had just finished closing up. Bidding goodnight to Mr. Hartcliff, I walked out with youthful hope to see if Mrs. Calloway was still waiting up for me. I spotted her car down the road and made my way there, happy to see my night was not ruined. Making our way towards a nice remote place just outside town, we wasted little time. As per the norm, we turned the radio on as we did.

Just as I was getting my pants off, the same effect came through again. The music faded out into static. Mrs. Calloway moved to change the stations and yet again, it was everywhere. She was complaining about the car having a lousy radio and it was all her husband’s fault, (as most things seemed to be). I didn’t mean to, but I found myself rushing up to shush her, the soft press on her lips smudged her lipstick a bit. Her face spiked with a bit of anger at the motion, but I had to keep her quiet. The static had faded slightly again. The voice was back and saying something. I tried my best to hear it, make out any part of it. It was gone again just as quickly as before. The radio went back to normal and remained that way the rest of the night. I could have pondered on it more, but Mrs. Calloway’s carnal attention drew my mind away from any deep thinking for the rest of our time out there. A young hormone-fueled mind is such an easy thing to sway.

That night, when I got home, my father was asleep on the sofa. I pulled up a blanket for him and went to put up the dinner plate that he left on the coffee table. It was close to midnight and the station sign-off was getting ready to play. The national anthem was already playing itself out when I walked back from the kitchen. As I made my way to shut off the TV, the static came on. For a moment, I was expecting to hear the voice again. Somehow it filled me with a temporary sense of fear. Why that was I could not explain at that time.

I remembered that of course, the TV goes to static after midnight. This wasn’t something strange, it was normal. Even so, I remember walking up with a bit of caution before I clicked it off. I don’t know what I expected to happen. That night I had a restless sleep. I had these nonsense dreams of falling through doors in the floor or being lost in a purple ocean. Strange stuff, none of it making any sense yet all of them feeling very real in some way.

Morning came and I had felt as if I had worked a graveyard shift. I was exhausted through and through. The day’s run at the hardware store was thankfully quite uneventful, save for one fella that came in near midday.

Blairsville was a small town, the kind of place where you really did know just about everyone, and this person was definitely not from around town. He came in wearing a red mechanic’s jumpsuit with an orange bird on the back. His face looked tired and worn out. His hair was a shaggy mess. His look coupled with the way he moved and looked, It was like he was in a hurry and somebody was coming to get him. The other thing was that he bought a hefty bit of our stock as well. Mr. Hartcliff was out to a late lunch so it was just me there. He ended up spending over $600 on miscellaneous items. Back in 1965, that was a hell of a lot. Today, that would be easily over a few grand spent.

He bought shovels, tape, bags, all of our screws, a safe, and damn near anything else we had laying out. When I went to ring him up, he just put $900 in cash down saying it should cover everything. I wanted to say something about it being too much, but he was done and gone before I could really protest. When Mr. Hartcliff came back, he was surprised, to say the least. He thought the man might have been a robber of some sort when I described him. He decided to hold onto the money for a while just in case he came back. There was a look on his face when I mentioned the red jumpsuit, he asked me about the orange bird on the back without being prompted. When I told him there was one, he just looked off into the street as if in deep thought. When pressed on it later, he just said not to worry about it.

That evening we closed up shop together and went our ways as normal. It hit me that I had not seen Mrs. Calloway at all that day. I decided to see if her car was down the road per our normal meeting spot but it wasn’t. I went back to the pharmacy but she wasn’t there either. Thinking she had just gone home for the night, I decided to walk up towards the school to get a ride back with my father on his way out. It was a football practice night so I knew he would still be there.

He was happy to see me and we enjoyed a quick diner burger on the way home. We talked about our day and I shared the story about the big spender that came through the shop. All in all, it was a nice and decent evening. I can’t stress to people how important times like that are. It’s too bad that you only realize that once they pass into memory.

While we chowed down on those wonderful diner burgers, the news played on the radio. Some depressing bits here and there as always, but what caught my ears was the sudden static that came in. This time it was louder and almost rhythmic in its tone. It got to a very high pitch and then waned down to a mere thumping murmur. No whispering voice this time. It just ended and the last bit of the newscast finished out. Someone in the back yelled to get that damn junker fixed. People laughed, including us, and the night just sort of moved along for everyone. Everyone, except for me.

I laughed along with my dad, but even then, sitting in that diner I knew something was wrong. I didn’t want to give it any notice, but it was a feeling that I could not shake off completely. Seemingly I was the only one feeling that way. As we drove home that night, the radio in the truck went in and out of static events. Each one lasted only about two or three seconds at a time. My dad said it must be something wrong with the station. He mentioned Mr. Hartcliff might know something about it. I asked why and my father informed me that Mr. Hartcliff had been a radio operator in the Navy for a while and stuff like that was in his wheelhouse. I made a mental note to talk to him at work the next day about it.

That night my sleep was nearly as dreadful as the night before. Hard to make out dreams that lasted only moments at a time rushed at me every time I laid down. The same things over and over. Rushing waves and roaring storms on some oddly colored beaches. At best, I made it to the morning with a single solid hour of sleep to get me through the day.

Heading into work, I noticed that the pharmacy was still closed. The couple that ran the place usually had it open an hour before everyone else. I also didn’t see Mrs. Calloway’s car parked anywhere. I thought it odd of course, but just let it go for the moment. After all, people were allowed to be late from time to time.

Mr. Hartcliff was already in the hardware store as usual. I greeted him and hung my coat up moving to grab a cup of coffee from the back. With the morning duties settled in, I went right into my questions about the odd radio activity. I explained that it was happening quite a bit in the past few days and of course of the weird display at the diner the night before. He made a quick joke about my father talking about the past a bit too much and walked off to handle the inventory sheet again. I inquired about it a few more times and he found ways to deflect the question each time.

I could not grasp why he was being so standoffish about the radio static. It was, after all, just a simple question of interference, or so I thought. On my last bit of prodding, he shot me a heavy glare and walked right up to me. He said some things are better not discussed in public, like a certain local affair going on with a certain married redhead. It took me a moment to process what he was saying as my stomach dropped.

Right away I got that he was keen on my late-night meetups with Mrs. Calloway and that took me for a shock. Though I also got the implication that he didn’t want to talk about the radio issue either and the “why” of that made me even more interested to pick his brain on the matter. He grabbed my arm and simply whispered, “Top storage ten minutes, act normal”.

Shortly after making a hurried show of sweeping the floors and checking the register, I made my way up to the storage room above the shop. Mr. Hartcliff shut and locked the door behind me. He had this sour expression on his face, almost as if he was fighting the idea of talking to me. Eventually, we sat down on a collection of boxes and he began to speak.

He told me a bit about his time in the Navy. About things he learned, things he saw, and things he hoped never to experience again. Then he got on to the odd radio static we had going on. He explained that it was a rouge signal, or rather a pirate radio station in operation. Although, he also said it was more than that. I won’t bore you with the details, but he spent a decent amount of time explaining the nature of radio waves and the general science behind them to me. Suffice to say, the man seemed to know his stuff.

He then went on to tell me that these static events were something we shouldn’t be hearing. More directly, it was something that humans should not be able to hear at all. When I asked him what that meant, he just nodded and left it at that.

He did elaborate on where the signal was coming from. According to him, at some point in the past five years, a private contractor had bought up a bit of land west of the town. A place off in the woods, you could reach it by taking the right turn off of Olive Avenue down the dirt path. If you kept going straight you would see the small single-story building where they set up. It was a remote spot, hard to find unless you knew to look for it. Hell, even if you did know to look, it was still a rough place to get to. They spent a good deal of time using various techniques to make it look like just another green spot in the forest. He added that he was sure they build some form of transmitter on the site as he noticed the trucks roll through with the materials. He could tell what they were right away. Not long after that, the site went online.

There was some kind of electrical accident at the station which left them with a need for multiple quick repairs. This is how he got involved with them. A representative brought him over to help with wiring work. Seemingly, they had knowledge of his background in the Navy. They paid him to be quiet on anything he saw, had him sign a lot of papers as well. I asked why they didn’t just bring on one of their own. He said he got the feeling they wanted to keep all their work as local and secret as possible, and they knew how to ensure the secrecy. From the way he said it, I could only assume they threatened him in more ways than one to stay silent.

\&#x200B;

Mr. Hartcliff said that the kind of radio transmissions that place worked with aren’t natural or man-made, but something wholly apart from such easy logic. As he put it, the sounds you hear from that transmitter were never meant for people, they leave you with a sickness of the soul. His comments were anything but sensible to me at the time. At points, he seemed to be more in his own thoughts than actually speaking to me at all.

He continued that sometime in 1964, the place had some kind of incident, and then it seemed to just close up shop as it were. Mr. Hartcliff said that the people who worked there only came into town on rare occasions, maybe three times total in the whole length they were there. He only knew the place was shut down when he went to check on delivery that was never picked up at the shop.

When he got there, he said the place was boarded up on the outside and looked it had been abandoned. The odd thing he said about it though, it wasn’t as if they had left it sometime in the past few months or years. No, it looked as if it had been empty for decades on end. Even stranger he said that there were signs on the front warning people to stay away due to the danger of a chemical spill, but they looked rather new. The path up to the place had fresh tire tracks as well. Seemingly someone was still tending to the site even in its dilapidated state.

Mr. Hartcliff had that sour and heavy look on his face again as if he could already understand my next line of questioning on the matter. “Why am I telling you all this”, he said. I shook my head agreeing with him. It seemed like something he didn’t want to talk about.

He explained that the voice we heard on the radio the other day, had been one he knew. It was a voice that he didn’t want to hear anymore. Mr. Hartcliff looked visibly agitated at the thought of the radio issue when he spoke. He nervously stood up to check the door one more time as well as the single window in the room.

Sitting down again, he proceeded to tell me about what was really going on at that radio station. Sometime during that initial repair work he did, he came into contact with a young girl that resided there. She had to be no older than 18 or 19 he said. She was inside a small room where the wiring work was needed. Some of the staff members were there watching him as well, all wearing the same red jumpsuits with the bird symbol on the back. He noticed that none of them would come into the room with him though. The room itself appeared to be soundproof as well. Overall, he said it was an odd experience, to say the least.

He tried to make small talk with the girl there, but she just stared at him in silence the entire time he was there. Nearly four hours of just looking at him sitting nearly motionless. I found it strange that when I asked what she looked like, he gave me conflicting answers.

He said she looked rather plain, unremarkable in features, and all together easily overlooked. In fact, he mentioned that during his work he would at times forget she was even in the room. He started saying she was a blonde but then said she was a redhead, or that maybe she had black hair. She might have been short or tall, possibly black or white. He said memory is a funny thing sometimes. I have to admit, that at this point, my trust in his words began to falter a bit.

Mr. Hartcliff raised his head to look at me as if he knew what level of crazy I was trying to place him at. “I know what you think, that it’s some issue with my age or that I just lost my mind a bit”, He said to me. “That place and what they had in there, it makes it hard to be clear with things”, he added.

He told me that after he finished the repair work, he was rushed outside and given a bag full of money, enough that he could buy a new truck outright. He wanted to ask questions, but he said the place had an honest dread about it that made you just want to be gone. Yet, as he made his way down the trail and out, he heard a voice, soft and whisper-like behind him. It stopped him dead in his tracks. He heard it once more. When he turned to look, the girl was there. She said something to him, but it was too low to make out. He said he blinked and she was just gone. One of the staff members asked him to keep moving. If he saw the girl or not, he didn’t make any mention of it.

He drove home that night and said he came up with some lie to tell his wife about the money. It sat heavy with him, but that quickly faded as strange events started to take place over the next few weeks. For one, he started to hear an odd hum of static build-up on the radio from time to time. Maybe once or twice he could hear a voice in the static, but nothing definite. At least not right away. The strange dreams started not too long after that. His description mirrored my own dreams in his confusion and odd surroundings. Then he told me about the night he went back.

It was roughly three weeks later. Somehow, there was another issue with the wiring again. As with before, they came to get him and told him little about the matter. Only that he needed it fixed again. When he arrived at the building, he could see what appeared to be evidence of violence near the side. From his description, one of the jumpsuits had been ripped to shreds along with whoever was wearing it. Blood and gore had covered the sidewall even after visible attempts to clear it away. He said the blood looked melted somehow. Mr. Hartcliff said he did ask what happened, but the staff just replied it was an accident and never elaborated more.

He went to the same room as before and the girl was there as well. Yet, this time she was sitting under a table looking out at him with heavy blue eyes. That detail, he could remember this time. He said for sure, she had these great and forceful blue eyes, sometimes they even looked violet. “Eyes that could run along your spine as sure as any cold wind”, as he put it. Something was different about the place as well. It felt like it had been taken apart and built over again, or was still in the process of being built. Panels were exposed in some places and other spots looked to belong to an entirely different building altogether.

He was able to finish the job easy enough and went to exit the room, but as he did, he felt the back of his jacket being tugged. The young girl was there, holding on to him. He said he went to talk to her, maybe hold her hand, and the room itself seemed to shudder. The next thing he knew, he was on the ground, flat on his ass and feeling like a bull had run him down. The girl was nowhere to be seen. He thinks he passed out for a moment as he woke up in his car with another bag of money next to him. He didn't bother going back to the site to check anything else out that night. He just drove home and sat in his chair waiting for any kind of sleep he could get.

The following day, that’s when the radio static started coming on again. Mr. Hartcliff said that he woke up to the radio playing next to him. His wife had turned it on when she got up, letting him sleep. At first, there was a moment where he was trying to recollect the moments of the night before, trying to see if it was real. Although, he said that the bag of money next to him was proof enough it had been real.

Just about then his wife made a remark about the music playing on the radio. She said it was something about it not being familiar, wondering what station it was set on. Mr. Hartcliff said he listened to the song and it sounded like a woman singing a love song, albeit in a hush whispered tone. At once, he thought of the young girl in that room. It played for a few more moments and then went to that low hum of static we both knew. That’s when something new happened with the static. He said that a commercial came on, of a sort.

Another woman’s voice came through, nice and strong this time. It wanted everyone to remember to eat well and check out Bradwells radio for all their nightly songs for all the best dreamers out there. I asked him what Bradwells was as I have never heard the name before. Mr. Hartcliff responded that at the time, it was new to him as well. However, he was sure that it was one and the same with the location he had been working out.

The following days, he would hear the same broadcast over and over. Some nights he would dream in vivid restless oddities. Other nights he would just wake up feeling as if he had just run a marathon. Then, one day on his way into the hardware store, he heard the static again. Only this time it called out to him by name. He stopped his car to pay attention as it came through again. The thing was, he said it sounded like it was past the radio and right on his shoulder. He told me how he gripped the steering wheel and closed his eyes, not daring to look around.

One more time he heard the voice and felt a hand running down his back, a set of cold fingers placed under his ear. The sensation wracked his nerves with trembles of fear until he could not bear it any longer. He said when he opened his eyes, there was nothing there, save the sound of that same song on the radio again. The moment had him broken for a while. He sat outside his car trying to catch his breath, calm his nerves, simply trying to collect his mental faculties.

Late that same day, one of the jumpsuit staff members came to see him at the store. At first, he thought they were there to get him again, but this time the man simply brought a set of papers. Just an order of items they wanted for the site. Nothing really fancy, just items for repairs and cleanup. The man who dropped it off said nearly nothing and paid in full right away. He said he would pick it up next week. Mr. Hartcliff said he asked the man if the station was called Bradwells. The man looked at him with a shocked face. The fella simply replied, “yeah”, and walked out appearing to suddenly become quite worried. That was the last time anyone from the site came through.

As he mentioned, the delivery arrived and was never picked up. Seeing as he was paid for the order, he felt that he should at the least ensure they got it. Driving up to the site, he saw the state the building was in. Rundown and in disrepair, the place was nothing like he remembered it. Yet, even in its seemingly abandoned state, the short radio tower on the back seemed to be up and powered. Although, he did mention it looked different now, more complex in a way. It had various extra amplifiers and what he assumed were wired power sources on it. He unloaded the materials and left them there at the front of the building. He said he didn’t feel right holding on to them.

Just as he was placing the last bit of it, he happened to look around the side area and saw a bit of red cloth by the entry gate. Moving up a bit closer, he could see it was what he suspected, one of the staff members. The body had been impaled on the brick wall by a piece of metal. The head had been rather horribly taken off and the spot around it seemed to be covered in a dull heat of some sort.

Mr. Hartcliff stated that he turned to leave, not wanting to spend another second at that place. When he did, he heard the same soft-spoken voice that he had come to dread. That time, he did not turn, he just ran to the car and drove home as quickly as he could. He noted he did not turn on the radio, even so, the light hum of static tried to come through.

Weeks went on after that event and here and there the static would come through on the radio. Sometimes the voice would be heard, other times not. Eventually, the issue stopped altogether right at the start of the next year. No single person other than his wife seemed to even notice the matter, and even she seemed to forget about it rather quickly. I asked about the dreams, and he said those were gone as well, for the most part, they went away with her. I asked him what he meant by that last part.

He looked down at his hands and squeezed them as if trying to let go of something within. Then he asked me, “Do you remember my wife? Do you remember Eliza?”. He looked up at me asking the same question again with tears in his eyes. “Do you remember my damn wife or not”, he asked again sternly.

Suddenly, just then it hit me that I had no memory of her. I don’t remember him ever talking about her until just that moment. “Eliza was at your graduation, most of your birthday parties, and Christmas”, he said to me. “She was a real woman, a real person that you knew”, he added. Mr. Hartcliff looked so defeated at that moment. As if he had experienced this same loss over and over many times before.

“Everyone I talk to about her, they just forget a few minutes later or act like I never said a word about her in the first place”, he said. I asked him directly, what happened to her. He sobbed and said that the thing from the static took her, it sang to her one night and she walked off into the moon. I was confused again; the man was speaking in fanatics to me. He told me to wait, if we could wait just five minutes and I still remembered who he was talking about, he would continue. Otherwise, it would be pointless.

We sat there in the storeroom for at least five minutes or more in total silence. He would not let me speak a word during that time. Finally, he looked at his watch and came back to me. Looking me square in the eyes, he asked me who Eliza was. I responded, “your wife...right?”. He put his face in his hands and sobbed a bit more before coming to hug me. “Goddammit you remember, you really remember!”, he exclaimed.

I don’t know how or why, even now, but I was able to retain details of his conversation. Mr. Hartcliff said he has talked to me, my father, the police, even Eliza’s own family about her disappearance. Each and every time it went the same. They acted as if she never existed at all. Shortly after, they would all just forget what they were talking about to begin with. Yet now, months later, somehow, I could.

Now, everything up to that point had been quite strange already, but what he was about to tell me next, I simply found to be so out there, so deeply unnatural, that I simply could not take him at his word. It was just too...bizarre.

This is what Mr. Hartcliff said happened the night his wife disappeared.

Eliza had been complaining of being hot throughout the evening. Not something that would be out of the ordinary, but the manner in which she complained seemed almost, sexual in nature. I could see this flare of flirty movements come alive in her. Something I had not seen in at least the past ten years from her. Mr. Hartcliff seemed to hold on to a memory for a few seconds before continuing.

\&#x200B;

As the night went on, she changed into shorts and a large t-shirt of mine. We sat on the couch watching TV as always after dinner. She kept on about being too hot and went to change again. It was odd because I was damn near freezing at that point. Eliza came back to sit down wearing just her nightie. It was her normal one, nothing new. Just this simple silk cream piece that she wore to bed.

Just...something was different about it that night. I could not stop looking at her. It was like she was filled with this attractive force that had me staring like a horn-dog teenager all over again. However, whatever had me drawn to look at her seemed to be one-sided. She seemed to forget I was even there at that point. Her eyes had a far-off expression as if she had truly left the living room for the moment.

She began to speak in a low whisper at first, rising in volume as she went on. It didn’t seem as if she was speaking to me, more so just in general as if lost in recollection. She spoke of missing the warmth of the violet oceans, the acrid smell of the purple and blue sky. The way the wandering tree crabs would sway in the hot winds. She detailed how the strong smells of blood and oil would waft across the villages. She smiled as she detailed how laughter and screams alike would fill the old nights as the three moons cascaded the shore in brilliant lights. Her words, exactly. It was like she had called up these old memories of some fantastic or dreadful place. Memories or maybe dreams, what’s the difference really?

She had started to breathe heavy, as if in some erotic event. I went to touch her, caress her, but this sudden push of coldness crawled over me. It felt like I had run into a nest of frozen spiderwebs. Each and every icy strand repulsing me from her. I checked my hand and face expecting to find something, anything there. Empty hands and a seed of growing apprehension were all I had found.

I looked up from my shaking hands as she began to hum a tune. It was a light and soft melody. It was nearly the same as the one from the odd radio station. Eliza, she started to hum the song louder and louder. Her eyes were closed now and the simple tune started to take on these complex patterns and noises. How she was making them baffled me.

Something else, I noticed that one of my ears had started to bleed. The weight of my own arms started to feel unnatural to me as if they shouldn’t have been there. The sensation of cold running along my back began to tense me up. Suddenly, Eliza stopped humming and let out a strong vocal burst of melody and pain. The song was almost a mirror of what had been playing on the radio. Just, it was so much more than a song.

I tell you I could SEE the waves of sound flowing here and there from her throat. Each reverberation carried images of a steaming sea or titanic whale-like creatures bearing freakish commonalities with a crab or turtle. It was like having my mind rearranged to suit the needs of the song.

The impact of this performance had me on my back. I had fallen to the floor and not even realized it. The song she sang was something no human could have formed. The notes carried ranges of such complexity that she simply could not have produced them. Imagine if you will, one person singing the range of 20 or more people single-handedly at the same time.

Soon, another wave of images struck out into my mind. Rolling fields of black-grass dotted with sprays of blood from some unknown prey. Searing wind-swept deserts of liquid silver hissed and popped revealing mass graves beneath. Another showed me a small animal that resembled a horse or goat locked in the maw of something that looked nearly human, only just enough to let me know it could never have been so.

My head roiled under both the song and the imagery; perhaps they were both one and the same? Either way, a heavy black pressure pushed against my insides bringing me in and out of consciousness. I remember trying to stand, get close to her, and fail time and time again. Eliza had begun to walk away from me, she was leaving out the door.

By the time I was able to stand and walk, she had already been outside of the house for some time, I gathered. There, on our beautiful lawn with the freshly planted flowers and stupid little garden flamingos, my world broke apart in so many ways.",1,1762155224.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

While I was there, I read “চাঁদের পাহাড়” — such an adventurous and timeless story! It felt perfect to lose myself in that world while surrounded by so many other books. 

The place had a beautiful atmosphere — soft light, the scent of coffee, and shelves full of wisdom and wonder. Sometimes, being alone in a space like that feels like reconnecting with yourself. I left with a calm heart and a happy mind.",3,1762155163.0,bangladesh,0,0.8,False

For context, I do both espresso (ranges from light-medium to medium-dark) and filter coffee.

I currently have the timemore 064s which I use for espresso, and a 1zpresso q2 heptagonal handgrinder that I use for filters. sometimes I'd use the timemore for filters too..

I find that the stock burrs on the timemore 064s don't quite produce the thick, syrupy espresso I'm looking for, and was wondering if it makes sense to change to the mignon zero 65 AP. BUT, theoretically the timemore performs better for lighter roasts, so I'm wondering if this would be an issue on the mignon zero 65?

Any thoughts or suggestions? Would like to hear from anyone who's had experience using these machines too.",2,1762155123.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1on5kfo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1on5kfo,Starting a home decor brand with a small inventory,"Hey everyone

I recently started a small homegrown decor brand called NIVASE Decor, focused on handcrafted, minimalist home pieces - from ceramic mugs, bowls, and planters to lamps, vases, and statement pots.

Each product is designed with a warm, earthy aesthetic inspired by slow living and clean interiors. Everything is made or finished by hand in small batches, so no two pieces are ever identical.

Our pricing starts at ₹99 (for smaller ceramic pieces like mugs and bowls) and goes up to 1999 (for larger vases and lamps). The goal is to make high-quality, aesthetic decor accessible - not mass-produced, but still affordable.

Current highlights:

Clay Drip Mug - ₹69 (intro offer)

Ceramic Aqua Bubble Bowl - ₹129 (intro offer)

I've added alot of other coffee/chai mugs in the collection 

New lamps + vases coming soon

Would really love your honest feedback on a few things:

Would you personally buy handcrafted decor items in this range (₹69-1999)? 2 What kind of pieces or colors would you love to see more of? 3. Do you usually discover such products online or offline (markets, Instagram, etc.)?

If you like the vibe, you can check out our Instagram page @nivasedecor or DM me here - I handle all orders personally for now.

Thanks for supporting small businesses Every bit of feedback helps me build this better.",1,1762155073.0,SideHustlePaglu,0,1.0,False

Not to mention on a previous drive this this individual split hot coffee and caused issues on my button cluster. Looking for advice to fix and possibly how much it might be. It's down to the metal and with winter coming I need to get this done soon but finances are a bit tight... Anyways, I would prefer to have the dent pulled over filler but I don't know what would be best...

If you want to read the rant feel free to keep going. This individual is family and have always been in financial issues. And most of the time that they are in my car is when I am voluntold to take them somewhere. This weekend they accidentally slammed the buckle in the door and I tried to not get upset at them. Anyone I have ranted to in my immediate family all say that this ""isn't a big deal"" and that ""it's easily fixed"". That wasn't the problem, my issue is that I saved and contemplated about this car for years, I got it new and am still paying it off now. I baby this thing with hand washing, detailing it,  and wanted to drive this thing until it dies. Now I can hardly look at it without getting extremely upset. This individual ""offered"" to pay for it but they already owe me a lot of money and I know that they really can't pay for it, so that just aggravates me more. 

As for the cluster damage it happened about a month ago now. I personally don't like having anyone eating or drinking in my car but my family doesn't listen and this time that came with the price of the cluster damage. I cleaned as best I could but it looks like a piece of the finish bubbled up and broke due to the heat. 


At the end of the day I know it's a ""thing"" and it can be ""repaired"" but I also know it will never be the same and I'm just overall sick to my stomach. Idk if you read this far, if you did thank you and I hope you have a good week.",1,1762154796.0,CarRepair,2,1.0,False

While everyone else is stuck in morning traffic heading to a boss they don’t really like, I can make coffee, read a book, go for a walk, or just zone out for a bit. I can do that because I’m not in debt and I don’t let stuff control me.

Back when I first started investing, I kept it simple. Buy some ETFs, follow the Nasdaq, maybe check gold when the news said it was up, and sell when it felt high. I thought that was all a regular person could do.

Then a friend told me him and his colleagues invested in a company before it went public. When it IPO’d, the returns were huge. That’s when it hit me,investing isn’t just something CEOs and insiders can only do.

Since then, I’ve spent a lot of time learning from books and online resources. It changed the way I think about money. Figuring out how to spot the next big IPO makes it easy to invest without overcomplicating things. By the time I hit 35, I was financially independent, and life actually feels good in a real, tangible way.

Honestly, the best part isn’t the money. It’s knowing I’m running my own life. I decide how to spend my time, still build for the future, and don’t have some client or boss breathing down my neck. Waking up every day on my own schedule never gets old.",0,1762154766.0,fatFIRE,4,0.27,False

I never thought I’d be writing something like this, but I need to get it off my chest.

Last year, I met a woman, 44, through a mutual space. She’s married with two kids, one around my age. I’m 26. At first, we just talked casually about fitness, life, and family. I even told my mom that I’d made a friend who’s older. My mother said, “Just be a little cautious.”

She initially thought I was some arrogant guy who doesn’t talk much — and honestly, I don’t. When I’m in the gym, I’m focused. But she was the one who approached me first, asking my name, since she already knew I used to talk to her son a bit about workouts.

Once, she and I were going to have a cup of coffee after finishing our workout. I used to help her with exercises too, but I always kept a bit of distance. I mentioned that my mother knows I talk to her, and from the corner of my eye, I saw her backing off, as if something had changed. I thought maybe she got awkward, so I ignored it. I had no romantic intentions.

In January, her mother passed away, just seven days before her birthday. I don’t think even her husband came to be with her then. I was available — I couldn’t go to her home, but I was there for her on calls and chats.

In the beginning, I didn’t know her age. I asked her once in the gym, and she was hesitant. I said, “It’s fine, you don’t have to tell me, only when you feel comfortable.” Later, during a call, she mentioned her age and said she hadn’t slept the whole night after that conversation. When she finally told me, she started crying. I reassured her that it was completely fine and she didn’t have to cry.

She also said no one in her family knew she talked to me. I asked, “Why? You can just tell them.” She said, “What will my kids think?” I told her, “Just show the messages.”

In the gym, even her son, who’s around 18, never taught her any workouts, but I used to help her. Her daughter used to notice me a lot too, but I didn’t care. I thought, if you’ve got a problem, talk to me directly. She once told me her daughter had asked, “Why does Mom talk to him?”

Her daughter studies at an Ivy League college, and her son is in engineering. Once, on FaceTime, she was crying after dropping them off, and I noticed she was alone. Her husband didn’t come. She never said it, but I noticed it myself. That moment made me realize how much she carried on her own, even in a “secure” family setup.

She used to ask me things like why I never had a girlfriend or if I got a lot of DMs from women. For context, I’m six feet tall, have a good physique, and people say I’m attractive. But I come from a humble background and have faced many difficulties. I never flaunted my looks because I always told myself to work on myself — looks are secondary. Becoming a good person matters more. I prefer staying low-key. And to be fair, she’s attractive too.

Over time, she started opening up more about her loneliness, how her husband provided everything but never gave her love, and how disconnected she felt in her marriage, especially with her kids moving away. Once, she said she wanted to see my face on FaceTime. I said sure, and we had a brief, formal chat. A few days later, she even talked to my sister on FaceTime.

But that day, things shifted. She told me she overthinks a lot about me. I was confused — I hadn’t pressured her to say anything. That same evening, she asked for another FaceTime call and said, “You don’t know what I think of you, and I don’t know what you think of me.” I listened quietly. Then she asked, “If your mom were talking to someone younger, would you accept it?” I said, “I know my mother very well. Even if she talks to someone younger, I wouldn’t mind, because she’d know her boundaries.”

Once, I asked her why she wished I were 40. She said, “You could have handled me more maturely.” I listened, but later I got a little upset. I had never touched her or crossed a line when she was vulnerable, so why would she say that? Later, I called her out. I told her, “You said you don’t know what you think of me. Well, I think nothing like that. I don’t even think that far. If a man acted in a weird way with someone who just lost her mom, that would be disgusting and sad.” She cried and said she didn’t mean it that way.

Sometimes, she would type messages and delete them. She said things like, “I want to take you somewhere,” or “I want to kiss your biceps.” Once, I noticed she’d written, “You only talk to me when you message me.” I called her and said, “You also have your job and responsibilities — why bother someone over that?” She agreed and said, “Yeah, you’re right.”

She would sometimes say things like, “Why aren’t you 40?”, “Why didn’t you come earlier in my life?”, and “Right person, wrong time.” She even told me, “You came from heaven.” Even after hearing things like that, I said, “Let’s just keep these things aside — I’m your friend, and that’s more than enough.”

From my side, I never had any intimate talks with her, not once. Our conversations were deep — about life, loss, and the difficult times I’d been through. She used to listen patiently. Sometimes she’d share small pieces about her own childhood, but never in much detail. It was always more emotional than romantic. And she knew that I saw her at a deeper level, not just on the surface. She knew I could see through her patterns, her desires, her feelings. We shared the same interests and wavelengths. I think that’s what scared her the most — the fact that someone younger could read her soul better than the man she’d spent decades with.

Once, she said something that really confused me. She asked, “If I ever do something to you, don’t you think it will come back on my kids?” I didn’t know how to respond. That sentence showed me she knew she was walking a thin line — that she was aware her actions could have consequences, but she still couldn’t fully stop herself.

I didn’t chase her, but something about her energy drew me in. It wasn’t lust; it felt deeper, like emotional gravity. We talked almost every day. She’d smile at me during video calls and hug me tightly when we met, though we only hugged about four times in our nine months of talking. Sometimes she would breathe heavily, and I told her to control her breathing — slowly, in and out. Once, she even said she had “a lot of self-control,” and I remember thinking she was fighting something internally.

Once on FaceTime, she was missing her mom and started crying. I saw her son walk into the room, but he didn’t say anything or comfort her. I got upset. I thought, it doesn’t matter the age — if a mom is crying, every son should at least ask if she’s okay or give her a hug. But he just walked away to do his own thing.

The weird part is, I never crossed any physical line with her. Not once. I always told her I could never hurt her, and I meant it. But emotionally, I fell in too deep.

Then, later this year in October, she suddenly started pulling away. She removed me from her contacts this November. My self-respect is more important than anything, so I didn’t say a word. When my mom told her I might be getting married soon, she looked visibly upset. That moment said a lot, even though she never admitted her feelings directly.

Now she’s gone — no contact, no closure. She once told me she “wants to live 15 more years.” I don’t know why that line sticks with me. Maybe because deep down, I know she’s not really living, just surviving through distractions.

Once, when we were sitting in her car, she said her mind was dirty. I asked, “Dirty as in what?” She said, “You don’t want to know.” I told her, “You’d better cleanse yourself,” and she laughed and said she needed to. Once in the car, I also told her, “You look loyal.” She suddenly looked at me, as if her mask had fallen off. It felt like she was silently saying she wasn’t loyal to her husband — and she’s not, not because of me, but because of the things she did in her past.

Sometimes, I get angry. She said she came from a secure background, had an arranged marriage, and yet somehow keeps seeking validation outside of it. Maybe she’s done this before. Maybe she’ll do it again. I don’t know. But I do know I got emotionally burned.

It’s been months now, and I’m trying to get my focus back. I’m trained in Data Analytics, but I lost my rhythm because my mind kept looping back to her. I know I can rebuild, but part of me still feels stuck in that story, like I can’t fully move on until I process it.

I’m not writing this for pity. I just want perspective — from people who got emotionally involved or who’ve been through something that felt real but wasn’t right.

I also shared what happened between us with my mother and younger brother. I’m very lucky to have such a great mom and brother. My mom was sad, and she blamed me too — and I accepted it. But she also said, “The most blame goes to her. She’s older, with more experience. Why would she pull my son into something like this?”

She also told me she knew something was happening between us — she could see it in me. “You looked lost whenever I used to FaceTime you,” she said. I told her I’m trying to remove that woman from my mind, even now.

My mom said that if that woman developed feelings for me and got attached first, she shouldn’t have said those things — she should have kept them to herself. My mother also said that when she met her, she sensed that energy too, that’s why she mentioned my marriage (not anytime soon, lol, because I’m focusing on myself). When the woman offered to drop us off in her car, I let my mom sit next to her, and I sat in the back seat.

Maybe I needed to go through this to learn self-respect the hard way. Maybe she came into my life just to show me what not to attach to.

Sometimes I think she saw me as just a normal guy, maybe even assumed I had lustful intentions like her, but I never looked at her that way. I once told her, “You’re also someone’s daughter and sister,” and she said, “Everyone should think like that.”

But yes, those mixed signals and flirtatious comments messed with my mind and threw me into turmoil. It still pisses me off sometimes.

Either way, I’m trying to let go. I feel guilty too. Sometimes I wonder if she was talking to me just to get validation. When she started ignoring me in the gym, I noticed it. She had done that before when her kids left home, but this time it was different. Out of the blue, no messages, no words, just silence. Even in the gym, she wouldn’t talk. I thought, is this person testing my patience? I already have a lot of patience — why is she doing this?

I asked her, “Why are you ignoring me? Is everything okay?” She said, “I’m not ignoring you.” I said, “I can see the lie, even if you don’t say it.” She said, “Focus on your life.” She said she doesn’t want to ruin this beautiful friendship. She said she has morals.

I told her, “I have morals too. But the kind of person you are, it doesn’t look good on you. I saw potential in you. We already have one life, so why do certain things that can make a person feel regret, like ignoring and then later realizing you shouldn’t have done it.”

I told her many times, “I want nothing from you, just honesty and clarity — that’s it.” I said, “I also push people away, but I do it with clarity, not the way you do.”

Chapitre 2

La slush aux framboises bleue ou la slush aux fraises rouge pétant étaient toujours ce que ces dames du macadam venaient commander. Systématiquement, d’une voix rauque, habituée à crier « Une slushhhhe a frambouèse sioûûûplait » peu importait l’heure, la quantité de travail accompli ou le niveau de sobriété, la concoction glacée était toujours favorite.  Je me suis souvent questionnée sur la raison pour laquelle, répétitivement, ce choix était fait par toutes et chacune. Mais s’étaient-elles passées le mot? Il y avait tant d’autres options, à mon avis, beaucoup plus alléchantes, tels le blizzard Reese & Coffee Crisp ou le simple cornet vanille molle trempé dans le chocolat au lait et généreusement arrosé de miettes d’arachides. Choix que je faisais quotidiennement au grand déplaisir de ma mère qui avait à cœur ma bonne alimentation d’adolescente grandissant trop vite. 

Le propriétaire de la petite crémerie, à la toute première journée de travail, avait assuré à ses quatre jeunes employées le libre arbitre de choisir ce qu’elles désiraient manger à tout moment. Ma gourmandise n’ayant pas de limites devant ces délices glacés je n’ai plus honte d’avouer avoir goulument engloutit trois blizzard en une seule journée de canicule de juillet.


Non, elles, rien d’autre ne les intéressaient. Était-ce le rapport prix versus dose de sucre, donc rush de dopamine immédiat qui les attiraient, et leur rappelaient un effet similaire causé par les drogues? Était-ce le liquide sucré rapidement aspiré qui venait rincer les relents salés récemment encourus? Était-ce la glace colorée bonbon qui leur rappelait une enfance trop rapidement perdue et qui rendait leur existence moins grise et terne? Le choix était prédictible, facile et ennuyant.


Si leur John avait été généreux cette fois-là ou que le sacrifice corporel avait été plus important, une slush extra-large était commandée avec un énorme sourire presque lumineux, presque vrai, presque beau. Le précieux contenant de polystyrène agrippé avec avidité telle une mère amoureuse qui n’a pas vu son nouveau-né depuis quelques heures, la paille immédiatement enfouie dans le trou béant et décrépit qu’était leur bouche. Les joues se creusant pour aspirer avec toute la détermination du monde le liquide artificiel et sucré qui changeait de celui récemment reçu sur une dentition douteuse et une langue râpeuse. Le sourire de satisfaction qu’elle pouvait finalement se permettre presque en cachette et qu’elle avait trop souvent observé sur le visage de leur client égoïste d’un plaisir monnayé à sens unique.


Les journées de grand achalandage de rue, elle avait à peine le temps de terminer leur troisième gorgée que le prochain client la hélait pour attirer une attention entièrement dirigée vers le précieux contenant. Moi, encore accoudée a la fenêtre de service, les prostituées ne rentrant presque jamais à l’intérieur du bâtiment, ayant, il me semblait, compris que leur place étaient sur le bitume et que le blanc des murs intérieurs et la propreté des tables rondes en mélamine seraient à jamais ternis par l’impureté de leurs personnes, observait l’interaction avec curiosité et amusement un tantinet malsain. 

Le client, visiblement impatient, ayant capté mon regard, ne manquait jamais de m’envoyer un clin d’œil me laissant savoir que, si intérêt il y avait, il me préférerait à la malchanceuse.

 Que je pourrais facilement gagner, en 15 minutes, ce que je ferais en une journée de travail complète avec lui. Que mon évidente nubilité, naïveté et innocence me gagnerait un tip clairement supérieur aux quelques vingt-cinq cennes parsemant avarement la tasse accolée à la caisse enregistreuse. Une tentative toujours gratuite, insultante et infructueuse qui les faisait saliver quand même à tout coup, mon expression de surprise ennuyée leur amenant un pétillement de satisfaction au coin de l’œil. 

La semence semée, l’opportunité présentée. Quoi de plus excitant que d’être le premier à avoir corrompu un corps pur et sans expérience. La loterie de la rue. Le seul métier ou l’amatrice de par son manque d’expérience évident gagne plus que la professionnelle.

La pute de rue d’Hochelaga n’a pas de pause-café ou break syndical de lunch. Elle est là donc elle est disponible. Ne pouvant refuser la demande, insistante et pressante qu’une autre un peu plus loin remplirait avec un tant soit plus d’entrain, ma cliente sacre d’une voix juste assez basse pour que je l’entende « Ostie de crisse de tabarnak de cochon, j’peux pas avoir la paix deux osties de secondes » roule les yeux en ma direction, se colle rapidement le sourire le plus artificiel digne d’une prestation de grande comédienne de série B et se dirige vers l’auto stationnée en double, lumières clignotantes, homme bedonnant, graisseux, clope au bec salivant tel un chien affamé devant un os ayant encore un peu de viande dessus.


La dame accoutrée d’une tenue aussi criarde que la couleur de son breuvage se penche à la fenêtre passagère de l’auto rouillée et bruyante, s’ensuit un échange qui dure en moyenne un total de 10 secondes, si le prix demandé pour le service voulu est en accordance avec l’humeur et les besoins de la dame, 20 secondes si négociation est nécessaire. La travailleuse entre alors dans l’auto agrippant toujours sa précieuse slush, seul bonheur de sa journée pourtant chaude et ensoleillée. Le client, sourire bestial au coin de la bouche, lance le reste de sa cigarette en ma direction avec un dernier clin d'oeil et presse l’accélérateur aussi satisfait de son achat que sa femme l’aurait été d’une nouvelle sacoche au gout du jour.

Me laissant, toujours accoudée, rapidement habituée par la répétition de la situation, rêvasseuse de la suite des événements. Mon imagination, toujours immense, instoppable et fertile stimulée par la scène crue passe les vingt prochaines minutes à créer dans ma tête la suite des choses. Récit que la pute, revenue un peu plus tard, le lendemain ou une semaine après ne manquait pas de me raconter. 

Surtout si violence il y avait eut. 

Violence qui malheureusement était trop fréquente. 

Une violence verbale, physique et psychologique. 

Une violence normalisée et banalisée.

Comme si elle le méritait.

# Title

> URGENT: Unmoderated Commercial Solicitation & Potential Minor Safety Issues in Large SFW Communities - Requesting Admin Review

# Post contents

---

Dear Admins and fellow Moderators,



I am requesting an Admin review regarding a persistent and unmoderated site-wide rule violation occurring in a few large, non-sexual, personal appearance/fashion communities.



The Violation (Reddit Rule 7: Prohibited Transactions):



Users are systematically leveraging their posts in these SFW communities to solicit and funnel traffic for financial gain. This abuse is happening openly and has been consistently ignored by the local moderation teams.



Direct Solicitation: Users are requesting and receiving gift cards, money transfers, and other financial compensation via Direct Messages (DMs).



Commercial Links: Numerous user profiles contain direct links to funding platforms (e.g., Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee) which profit directly from the traffic generated by posts on these subreddits.



⚠️ CRITICAL CONCERN: Potential Minor Involvement (Reddit Rule 4: Minors)



This behavior is happening in at least one community explicitly focused on teen fashion.



The solicitation of funds by users who may be underage, and the subsequent interaction with users requesting DMs and transactions, creates an extremely serious risk of predatory or inappropriate behavior involving minors (Rule 4), in addition to the Rule 7 commercial violation.



This level of systematic abuse and apparent moderator inaction on such a severe safety risk requires immediate Admin attention.



Request for Admin Review & Next Steps:



I am requesting that an Admin privately review the situation in the following types of communities:



Subreddit Type 1: A community focused on Teen Fashion.



Subreddit Type 2: A community focused on general Fashion/Appearance.



I have collected detailed, specific evidence (screenshots of DMs, profile links, and posts) for the Admin team, which I will share ONLY via private ModMail upon direct contact from an Admin.



Thank you for prioritizing the safety and policy integrity of the platform.",1,1762154615.0,modsupportremovals,0,1.0,False
1on5fgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1on5fgr/how_to_deal_with_coworker_who_is_too_nice/,How to deal with coworker who is too nice,"Hi Everyone,

I (25F) have this amazing coworker (40F). She's super sweet and really fun to work with.

My problem is that sometimes it gets to the point where she's a bit tooo nice. For example, if she buys a coffee and sweet treat for herself she will also buy me one, even if I insist that I don't want one or that i've already had one. If I ask to pay her back she will adamantly refuse. If I try to buy it for her instead she will refuse and rush ahead and pay for it anyway.

One time, she was showing me fruits from her garden and her apple tree I said I make a great apple crumble and so the next day she brought in a WHOLE heap of apples without me asking. It was incredibly nice but also I felt  indebted to her so I felt like I HAD to make her an apple crumble. 

Recently, she's been selling handmade bags that are really cute so I asked if I could purchase one. I fully intended to pay her and I said that when asking her for the bag. She just sent me a message saying that it was ready and when I asked her for her details so I can pay her she is refusing to send it to me. I told her in that case I'd give her cash when I see her but she is also refusing that too. 

For context, we both have an asian background so I know this dance of who gets to pay is quite common but I feel like at this point it's too much. I hate the feeling of being indebted to someone like this. And I also have a the feeling that if I were to stop insisting I'll pay instead and just accept it as a gift she would find this to be a bit rude. 

What can I do going forward? Am I over thinking this? I feel like i'm constantly trying to find sneaky ways of paying her back but sometimes I find this a bit exhausting. ",3,1762154532.0,socialskills,5,1.0,False

It was supposed to. I had one errand that I needed to do with my mother today, and she drug the grocery shopping on (which is already negative as it is), until 8pm. Which was weird for her.
She shows up with my sister, who I had explicitly texted last week and mentioned that she could spend SOME time with me at my house over the next two months with EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF CLOTHING that my sister has. Shows up with all of her toiletries, clutters my coffee table that’s part of my morning routine, rearranges things in my carefully put together fridge, has a MINI FRIDGE that she purchased earlier today and moved my candles in my cozy comfort spot to plug in. She’s not staying the night or two; she’s acting like she’s moving in. And I know that she’s not paying rent or anything like it.

I tried to calmly address my concerns with all of her things being in my house, around the time that I wanted to try to get to bed. She didn’t take well to it. She gets snappy and ugly with me, and immediately starts texting a friend as we’re having the argument, about how terrible of a person I am. She calls me the name of a family member that played a part in my own traumatic upbringing. Keep in mind that my sister is also a grown adult, at 23 years old.
I texted my mother about my issues, because my sister can’t give me a yes or no answer. My mother goes into a pity party of, “Oh, well she REALLY wanted to spend time with you. We spent hours today getting her things together. You should let her stay longer than a few days.”

It feels like I’m being punished once again, because other people want me to please them. It is not my fault that my clear texts were misconstrued. My family can never just pass on actual information to each other; it’s always a game of telephone. I frankly do not care that my sister spent all day preparing to move into a house that isn’t hers. I want and deserve my alone time when I have it, and it shows once again that my family doesn’t respect and understand those needs of mine.
I couldn’t even go to sleep at an earlier time, because of my sister moving all of her things around, and going in and out of rooms that she really doesn’t have  any business in.
I’m tired of being stressed out and emotionally exhausted on days where I shouldn’t have been. At this point, I’m strongly considering not even welcoming her back to spend another night in the future.

1on5877,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1on5877/my_first_am_alliance_did_i_make_the_right_choice/,My first AM alliance. Did I make the right choice?,"**Little bit of background about me (26M) and the girl (25F):**

  
**Me:** Born and brought up in a Tier 1 city. CA. Slightly introverted but I still try to get along with people I work with, friends, and family. Once I’m comfortable with someone, I can talk non-stop. Cinephile and bike enthusiast. Family is neither too conservative nor too liberal. No past relationships.

**Her:** Born and brought up in a Tier 2 city. Tried NEET after high school but dropped it. Did ECE, then an MBA. Completed a 3-month bootcamp on coding. Has around 8 months of post-qualification experience working as a front-end developer. Makes about 25% of what I make. Loves cooking non-vegetarian food. No past relationships. Family looked a bit conservative. Dad is a headmaster, mom a postmaster. 

We both met for coffee in Bangalore as she was also working there. Initial impression was good, but I felt the conversation was very one-sided. I was asking all the questions, but she answered them properly and with interest. We both felt like proceeding ahead and gave confirmation to our parents. My parents were supposed to visit her family in our hometown two weeks later. I thought of getting to know her more in the meantime.

We chatted for a short time after the coffee meet. I asked her to let me know when she was free for a casual talk. She didn’t reply that night. I tried calling her to see if something was bothering her since she hadn’t responded to my text and the previous chats felt very dry. Her line was busy. She didn’t call or text for the next two days. I thought maybe she wasn’t interested and informed my family. They spoke to her dad, after which she called and said there had been talks of layoffs at her company and she was worried.

I explained how I expected honest communication both ways, and we agreed to take things slow. We spoke a couple of times after that-maybe once every three days. Even during calls, it felt like I was leading. No questions from her side. This kept bothering me, but I gave her the benefit of the doubt-maybe she needed time to be comfortable around me.

We reached our hometown three days before the visit. I expected at least a “Have you reached?” or “When are you coming?” from her. But nothing-no contact until the morning of our visit to her place. I was doubtful, but once we visited and met her family, my mind changed. They all seemed so nice and warm-some of the kindest people I’ve met. I know everyone’s at their best during the first meeting, but something about them made me feel at home.

I met her and spoke again. It still felt one-sided. I ran out of things to talk about. But she didn’t seem rude-she listened with interest and even insisted on taking a picture together. That made me say yes.

Their family was supposed to visit our place a couple of weeks later. I tried my best to talk to her and keep the conversation going, but I started losing interest as it again felt one-sided. I installed Snapchat just because she asked if I used it. She said she regularly sends snaps, so I started sharing them too. Some of the snaps she didn’t even open. I would have sent her a message on WhatsApp with no reply, but she’d post a snap. Still, I kept giving her the benefit of the doubt.

One day, I called and asked how her day was and what she did. She said “Nothing.” I asked if she watched something or used Instagram or anything. She replied in an irritated tone, “Why do you keep asking this?” I felt bad. Then I asked what she was having for dinner- she said “I don’t know.” I asked if she wouldn’t help her mom or something- she replied, “It’s not like girls have to cook and all.” I didn’t ask her *to* cook, I just asked if she did. Something about the tone didn’t sit well with me.

I decided not to initiate conversation for the next couple of days. She didn’t either. I thought of ending things there and told my parents to convey it to her dad. After this, she sent me pics that she took that day as they attended a family function. Tagged me in instagram. This had never happened before.  And she called, and we had a good talk-about how she felt I was very judgmental, and that’s why she didn’t feel like talking more; how she expected me to bring her something like chocolate when we met; how I kept going on bike rides but never asked if she’d like to join. I explained that I was planning to put in all the effort once we got to know each other better, and I thought of continuing since she seemed genuinely interested and had her own expectations too. 

I called her the next day. She didn’t pick up. No text or call after that for two days either. That’s when I decided not to drag this any further. If this were the first time, I’d have understood-but how hard is it to communicate that she’s busy or whatever?

I called to explain this but she didn’t pick up. So I sent her a long message explaining why it wouldn’t work between us and wished her the best. She came back defensive again, saying she knew I wasn’t interested in marriage from the beginning, and that it’s a big deal for a girl to even talk to a guy at this stage. She asked, “Why did you say no if you weren’t interested in marriage?” and all that. I apologized if she felt that way and didn’t explain any further.

1on583s,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoolForIt/comments/1on583s/why_gifting_strangers_online_isnt_that_weird/,Why gifting strangers online isn’t that weird...,"Sometimes I look at creator wishlists and think: why are we buying gifts for strangers? It still feels a little weird, tbh. 

But the longer I’ve watched it, it looks like a new version of tipping mixed with micro-patronage. We already pay for vibes, coffee shop ambience, Twitch banter, niche newsletter, gifting is the same impulse with a bow on it.

One great example of stranger gifting going right: a commenter said the BEST time they gave is the 4 Diamond Fund, which helped their parents pay for a brain-tumor surgery. 

Otherwise they hate grifting and bought their own baby registry. 

That’s the point, clear outcomes beat vague “support me” asks.

Psych-wise, this tracks. Parasocial bonds + reciprocity = “I got value, I’ll return value.” 

The warm-glow effect makes small gifts feel good, and public giving nudges creators to deliver more since commitment is visible. 

Oh!! that’s actually interesting: people report higher satisfaction when their gift feels like an “investment” in someone’s growth, not a handout.

So if you’re going to gift, aim for creators, professionals, or causes you respect, truly, with transparent goals and updates. 

Think “help them buy gear, finish school, fund a project.”

Early on, I lucked into a great *angelic setup*, pulled the key, and started stacking some serious power.

Right now I’m sitting at **Deadline #29 (no mods),** easily the furthest I’ve ever made it. I stopped taking memory cards once I had enough duplicates and focused on growing the build instead. It’s been working *way* better than expected… but I think I’m finally starting to feel the game pushing back.

At this point, I’ve been running this build for days. My eyes hurt, my coffee’s gone cold, and I swear the background music is looping in my head even when I’m not playing. Still, I can’t stop, this run’s too good to let die.

Looking back, I feel like I missed a few *charms* early on that could’ve pushed it even further. With a bit more seed luck, this could’ve been an absolute monster.

Anyway, I’m curious, how far has anyone else actually made it? I’ve seen some YouTube runs, but most seem to tap out around 30. Has anyone pushed beyond that? Bonus points if you’ve got proof (screenshots or vids).

I think this is causing the motor to heat closer towards 65-75% up the gauge rather than middle if the car is revved to about 1800RPM in park. 

I do not have experience with tapping or drilling our screws. Could I jack up the front passenger side where the radiator fill cap is, or drive the car a few feet up a slanted incline in my lawn to raise that portion of the vehicle, making it the highest point in the system to bleed from? Can I slide a coffee stirrer under the clamp on the hose next to stripped bleeder valve to try bleeding that way instead?

1on4tva,https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/1on4tva/my_sti_horror_and_guide/,My STI Horror and Guide,"Just wanted to share my recent STI experience because I know how scary and confusing it can be, especially if you don’t have insurance.

A few days ago, I developed symptoms ,painful urination and a weird discharge, nothing like anything I’ve ever experienced before. The pain was honestly excruciating.

I immediately ordered a urine test through JustLife. It cost me around 300 AED, but the hardest part was waiting 48 hours for the results while dealing with that pain.

A tip while waiting:
	•	Avoid acidic drinks, coffee, tea
	•	Stay hydrated so your urine isn’t too concentrated 

Once the results came back positive for gonorrhea, I started calling hospitals and clinics all over Dubai. Since I don’t have insurance, I was trying to find an affordable option.

Here’s what I found:
	•	JustLife quoted me 850 AED for a single ceftriaxone injection
	•	Most clinics gave similar or even higher prices

Then I found Al Mizhar Health Center (huge lifesaver 🙏)
Here’s what I paid:
	•	130 AED consultation
	•	80 AED for the ceftriaxone injection
	•	40 AED for a week of antibiotics

Total: 250 AED
(Compared to 850–1000 AED elsewhere!)

It’s been 20 hours since the injection, and the symptoms are already fading. 
	•	Don’t ignore symptoms it only gets worse if untreated
	•	Get tested right away
	•	Protect your partners tell them so they can get tested too
	•	Dubai does have affordable treatment options if you look around

If anyone is going through this, you’re not alone. STIs are common and 100% treatable when you act fast. Take care of yourself ❤️",22,1762152233.0,dubai,4,0.96,False
1on4sds,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1on4sds/wibtah_for_not_attending_a_friends_wedding/,WIBTAH: for not attending a friend’s wedding,"For Context: I(26F) have been friends with her (27F) for over 15 years. We practically grew up together and I considered her one of my best friends. In the past we always talked about our weddings and everything. Over the past six years or so since she met her partner and have been in a relationship with him.. she’s turned into someone I no longer recognize. She is always dependent on her partner, always bringing her partner along to everything (even girls night without any notice) planning everything around her partner’s schedule. 

Since she’s been dating her partner, she slowly started pushing me away by no longer making plans with me and her new friend group is the girlfriends of her partner’s friends. If we do plan anything she will invite the girlfriends to tag along. We both have other friends as well.. different friends groups that we keep separate from this friendship so in the past when we were hanging out, it would be just us almost like a catch up session. I’ve spoken to her about this but the response i got was she wanted all her friends to get along especially since she’s already making wedding plans and all of us would be bridesmaids. I let it go and carried on as normal until two years ago where she got engaged. I found out through social media when she posted the engagement photos as well as a brunch to celebrate. Mind you, all this time we were still in contact with each other, our planning wasn’t as regular as before but we were still hanging out and everything, not once did she mention anything to me. 
Nonetheless I was extremely happy for her and still communicating with her to make plans with her, to keep in touch with her… she would respond but not as quickly as before. Now she takes 1-2 days to respond to my texts, i let it go thinking she’s busy with her own life. Days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months and I realized we started drifting apart, the usual texts i sent got seen by her but she wasn’t responding the same day or if I invited her to something with some friends she knows as well.. she would decline or sometimes show up with her new group of friends (the girlfriends of her partners friends) but I pushed all that aside just happy to be hanging out with her despite noticing all the changed behaviours. She would act veryyy different around the new friends vs when we were just all alone. I decided to slowly stop the weekly texting and the check ins because we were drifting further apart. I would text her maybe every 2 weeks or so or sometimes every once a month just to see how she’s doing. 
I guess from her POV nothing was wrong, she would invite me once in a while if she felt like it and very last minute to hang out with her and the friends.. in the beginning i went but as time went on I realized the last minute invitations meant she never thought about me from the minute the plan is being made, again i wasn’t mad just disappointed because I was trying to make the effort to plan stuff with her but it was always one sided. 
In the past week, she started planning her wedding or at least that’s what she told me.. she has everything pretty much lined up and has already chosen her bridesmaids. I’m not included in that selection. Again i’m not mad about it because people grow and drift apart. Now whenever she talks about her wedding when she decides to text me or if i bump into her at the store, it’s like i don’t know who this person is anymore.. i don’t recognize her for so many reasons but she’s mentioned inviting me to the wedding. I didn’t say it to her face but I feel uncomfortable around her now basically since i really don’t recognize her.. she’s changed so much. 
Would it make me TAH if I decline her wedding invitation when I receive it? She mentioned getting married this December. In my eyes I feel uncomfortable going to a wedding for a friend who I don’t know anymore and drifted apart from especially with her new friend who I dont feel comfortable around because I really don’t know them and they are a very tight knit group. There will be some of the mutual friends we both know but I just feel very uneasy going to a wedding of someone i feel like is a former friend. I just don’t want to make myself or anyone feeling awkward at the wedding or for her to feel like there’s something wrong on her big day. 

Update to add: I feel like the invitation is coming out of obligation as I was speaking to a mutual friend about it and the mutual friend mentioned receiving an invitation to her bridal shower that’s in two weeks meanwhile I didn’t receive an invitation and I just saw (the bride to be) on Friday while i was getting coffee, i just asked her how she was doing and she started talking about the wedding, saying it was stressful to be planning a wedding but never mentioned the bridal shower.

1on4n33,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1on4n33/at_28_i_finally_realized_that_real_life_is/,"At 28, I finally realized that real life is inherently mundane and disappointing at best and downright terrifying and nightmarish at worst","Last year or two has been pretty rough on me. Chronic illness diagnosis, parents falling to illnesses, chronic loneliness (since 8), and quarter-life crisis hitting me like a truck...... You name it.

I grew up with very controlling, overprotective, sheltering, and strict parents. No friends, no dates, bullied at school, binge-eating disorder, never rebelled, never formed an identity, and pretty much missed out on every formative experience and milestone a human is supposed to have during their teenage years.

Growing up, I pretty much lived in the future to cope with the suck. ""One day in the future, I will finally be able to escape the repressive rut and live an adventurous and exciting life to the fullest"", I used to tell myself. ""I will have a cool crowd of friends, a cute (she doesn't even have to be hot) girlfriend, and a cool life filled with adventures. I will make up for the lost time the universe robbed from me during my teenage and young adult years"".

But that never happened. While I did get my career nailed down and got to embark on a lucrative IT career (thanks to my parents and education), life became work-eat-sleep-repeat. Zero friends. Zero extracurricular activities. Zero interaction with women (except for polite exchanges with the cashier or professional discussions with several woman coworkers I work with who are all at least 15 years older than me).

Do you know they have a saying in Mandarin? 兩點一線. Translated literally as ""two dots one line"", it describes a life where one travels between only home and work (two dots) without going to other places (hence the one line, aka the one path only between home and work). This saying describes my life perfectly.

I have always longed for adventure since childhood, and I've always loved to watch other people's lives on social media and YouTube. Personally, my favorite has been Shiey and Logan Paul. But the more I lived, the more I realized that in the end, there is no adventure in our perfectly mundane and disappointing existence.

There is no Hogwarts ticket coming your way. There is no Gandalf, let alone some Isekai bullshit. Even the so-called adventurous and fun lives I see people post on social media are mostly that, posts carefully curated to sell you a dream and unrealistic expectations of a better and more exciting existence. The travels, parties, relationships, adventures, fun escapades, and such? All is not real and made up. Instead, just like me, they live perfectly mundane and disappointing lives and grapple with terrifying and nightmarish curveballs life throws in every person's way sooner or later (illnesses and such).

I've finally learnt to appreciate the small things: a bottle of Zero Coke, a warm bento after work, a cool or funny post from social media after a lonely day of work. Although I know that social media is not real, I still relish in the dream that it is real. After all, social media sells you a dream of a better existence. Same for books, movies, games, anime, and all sorts of fiction that we humans produce and consume.

For all these years, I've always asked myself. Is this my life? My mundane, joyless, disappointing existence... is there all it is? Where's the adventure? The excitement? The relationships? The adrenaline rush? But now I've come to realize that real life isn't a novel, movie or video game where the main character is destined for an adventure. No. Instead, real life is inherently mundane and disappointing, and that is exactly why fiction and escapism have existed since antiquity, when we talked of legendary demigods and heroes going on adventures and performing feats that are impossible in real life.

It is a very humbling and grounding realization that work-eat-sleep-repeat is the default for all of us humans, and that there is no grander adventure or fun that awaits us other than the terrifying curveballs life likes to occasionally throw our way. As for the loneliness, FOMO since childhood, and restlessness of feeling that I'm not living life to the fullest? Unfortunately, that is also the nature of real life.

There are no grand childhood escapedes where you and your childhood friends sneak into places you aren't supposed to go to; there are no mischevious teenage adventures where you make out with your teenage girlfriend who deliberately dressed up in an extra skimpy outfit just for you in an abandoned building while you drink beer and count the stars; there are no cool friendships of where you and your comrades go explore the most remote and uninhabited regions in the world; hell, there aren't even fun parties where you can laugh away at your hearts content while you fumblingly attemp to impress your giggling crush with the latest magic trick you've learnt online.

None, those are dreams and unrealistic expectations only that are sold to us via social media and fiction. What is in reality is instead acceptance of the mundane and disappointing nature of life while making peace and finding contentment in it by finding joy in the mundane through the small things we have in life. A warm mug of coffee, morning birdsong, buttered toast as breakfast, the sunset view, a funny post on social media, a good book to cuddle in with, a peaceful, quiet night.",12,1762151508.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.94,False

My husband was on the other side of the hall, so I ran towards this monkey shouting. The monkey didn't budge and I pulled a furniture to hit the monkey and it finally moved away from the balcony door and I closed it shut. To put this in context, I am scared of even tiny kittens and puppies. So this was all adrenaline doing the work. I was shaking by the end of this with my throat hoarse from all the shouting.

My husband saw all of this commotion. I expected him to give me a hug and help me calm down. But he just said good job and carried on with his chores. The only acknowledgement he did about the monkey was to take the baby to the other balcony to show him the monkeys. Then in another 5 minutes he was shouting at me to help out with some chores in the kitchen. 

Am I overreacting in expecting empathy? I had to word it out to him that I was shaking and needed some hot water to soothe my throat from all the screaming. He then made me hot coffee.

1on4l00,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1on4l00/i_think_they_need_to_completely_rebalance_items/,I think they need to completely rebalance items for Part 3.,"*Unsure what to flag this. Technically a spoiler for items in Rebirth?* 

Remake and Rebirth ran into the same problem. Item abundance means you literally never lack for anything so you never need to BUY anything. That makes Gil functionally useless, and item-related materia like Item master & economizer and Steal become worthless, especially in Hard Mode when you need them most.. Steal had a few fringe cases you wanted to use it in Remake to grab a couple items, it had handful use-cases in Rebirth for a specific quest and for Safety Bits. 

Let’s be real how many of you used damaging items like grenades throughout the games? Morph? Useless. Admittedly Steal had a few fringe uses in Remake (steal a weapon I recall), and in Rebirth it almost never matters outside one quest and farming Safety Bits. That’s it.

So here's what I think they need to do:

Make items WAY MORE EXPENSIVE, but PRECIOUS. Phoenix Downs, Potions and the like should be more powerful but RARE. No crafting them either. You should rely on Magic for most of your business related to recovery. Because Magic is plentiful but singular, items should be the opposite; rare but multi-faceted. 

Make items grant additional effects. Armor-Piercing grenades could add a defense-down debuff on-top of it's damage. Phoenix Down could grant a temporary barrier just to get people back on their feet without getting immediately smacked down. Regular potions - Fine, trash-tier, but anything above should feel impactful. In general items need to feel impactful to use, and give you incentive to use materia like Item Economizer and Item Master to get the most out of them. 

This also relates to Steal and Mug. Outside of Yuffie and *maaaaybe* Tifa (if you lack ways to get airborne), they are both useless for 90% of the game. Whatever item you can morph or steal you can also BUY later down the line. There's nothing of tangible utility you can steal from any enemy that you can't simply grab IN BULK. 

Make Steal/Mug/Morph purpose by giving you these now precious items that are rare and expensive, and make them part of your economy as you can sell them for a neat profit. We're flipping the script, making you work for your fortune and once you go back to your den to bask in your halls of hoarded items you'll know you worked for EVERY SINGLE ONE of those powerful little boosters. 

Make items bloody expensive if you want to buy them, but easy to acquire with steal, and if you want to grab items in bulk; make that Morphs niche, every enemy you morph gives you 2-5x the regular amount of items depending on rarity. 

  
Hardmode/Arena/Simulation balance is simple. Make item loadouts, allow you to carry a set number of items, use as you go with refills at every town/jukebox, HOWEVER items you STEAL you get to keep and use for the section. It'll make every single item-related materia so much more tempting to include in whatever loadout you bring. 

I knew starting Rebirth that since Remake locked items out of Hardmode, I didnt even bother levelling ANY of the item related materia because they become worthless when you need them. 



I didn't really think this through enough to make it an airtight suggestion *(it's bloody early, no coffee yet)*, but at least it's something because the current system of showering you in wealth is bloated and shallow, and completely undermines it's own mechanics. 

I know there's no shot any of this gets taken into consideration as I am posting on reddit, so all I am really doing is airing my frustrations. Thanks for reading. 

*Realistically I know nobody actually uses items, especially if they are rare as that's just the item-hoarders mentality, ""Just-In-Case"" paralysis, but that's mostly because you're saving it for a rainy day. Make that rainy day come with Hard-Mode and there's an astronomically tiny chance people might actually use their items.* ",5,1762151280.0,FFVIIRemake,5,0.86,False

We designed with travelers, not just for them ✈️","Travel has always been an essential part of life, whether it’s for work, a weekend escape or a long vacation. Wherever we go, we want the things we carry to make life easier, not heavier. Heavy, tangled, space-hogging chargers were never meant to come along for the ride. 

When we started designing our CryoBoost® 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station, we realized that the need to simplify isn’t limited to your desk, it follows us all the way, especially on the trip. But traditional charging stations weren’t built to fit into your luggage or your daypack. So we set out to build a truly capable travel version. 

It had to be **smaller, thinner, lighter,** and never feel like extra baggage. It had to **charge fast**, giving your phone a solid boost during a quick rest at the hotel. And it had to **be quiet**, respecting those rare, precious nights of travel sleep. 

**Every one of these ideas came from real users.** 

With Qi2.2 and our upgraded CryoBoost® cooling system, we went even further, improving not just speed, but the entire travel experience. 

To meet the needs of users constantly packing and moving, we redesigned the watch charger into a **one-piece foldable structure**, no detachable parts, no risk of losing anything. It’s also **slimmer than ever at just 15.8 mm**, small enough to slip into any bag or even your pocket, always ready for a quick top-up at the airport or a coffee shop before you hit the road again. 

For users who said indicator lights kept them awake, we added a **manual fan and light control**, ensuring a truly quiet night. 

So when our Foldable was named one of **TIME’s Best Inventions of 2025**, it didn’t just belong to us. It belonged to every user who shared their story, every review that pointed us in the right direction, and every journey made a little easier.

The treatment seemed to help but my body negatively reacted to the erythromycin (as it does with most medications) so he said I might have a mast cell issue causing the sibo and prescribed me Gastrocrom.

I’m not nearly as bad as folks I see on here, my symptoms only react to a few things; stress, exercise, heat, and then things like coffee, alcohol,  chocolate, protein and collagen powder, mostly the more high impact things. But even those things take about a week of buildup to cause problems, and when they do I get all the symptoms of mast cell degranulation. 

So I’m wondering, is gastrocrom the right way to go? I’ve read it really stays in the gut and affects mast cells there, but will I still get rashes and brain fog from a hot shower and exercise? I’m just worried it’ll only help with food related issues. I tried quercetin and luneolin first when I read about mast cell issues, but had a flare up to them.

And side question; for my side effects, which seem to be more body wide than gut centric, is glp-1 a better way to go? I don’t have diabetes but was pre for a few years and had a sibling who passed from type-2. I don’t mind paying out of pocket if it give me my life back.

Our goal isn’t to promote or spam — we’re here to **connect with locals**, learn about your favorite places, and highlight small businesses that make Texas such a great place to live and eat.

We’d love to hear from the community —
