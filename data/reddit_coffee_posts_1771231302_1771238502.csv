(Want to preface this by saying I know what I need from a partner! I’m just curious how others handle their partner participating, if they get drunk, or if you straight up won’t put up with it!)

I’m going to unfortunately end my engagement with my partner. I occasionally hit my weed pen, so not 100% sober sober, but I’m sober from literally everything else. I have set a clear boundary w/ this person. Usually they are great ab not drinking/doing drugs. But there have been a few times where he smokes weed while he’s not home, and texts me the most out of pocket shit ab how he’s not happy in our relationship and that I’m basically soulless. So my boundary is ur an adult. Do whatever the hell you want. But if you are gonna be intoxicated, please do not engage w/ me. 

Unfortunately, that boundary has been crossed over, so I left. I was gone from the house for one day and they had people over, finished so much alcohol, and were fucking snorting cocaine through my GLASS COFFEE STRAWS. Like wtf ur telling me no one had a fucking dollar. 

Anyways. I’m leaving bc I’m just over that phase of my life, and I’m really mentally stable for like the first time ever and I’m not gonna have someone else trample on it:)

TLDR: leaving my partner. Is your partner sober or what’s their deal? Just seeing what works for everyone else.

And yes, I know everyone is different!! I know what I need, so I’m not searching for answers for myself. Just curious how yall handle this:)",1,1771238400.0,dryalcoholics,0,1.0,False

We are talking about the Lore-Accurate Dad (Pre-Nerf)—a mythical entity whose power level scales directly with the thermostat settings and the proximity of a lawnmower.
While ""All of Fiction"" has heavy hitters like cosmic entities and multiversal gods, they simply aren't prepared for the specific mechanics of a Pre-Nerf Dad.
The Power Scaling of a Lore-Accurate Dad
To understand why fiction is in trouble, we have to look at the Pre-Nerf Stats:
The ""I’m Not Angry"" Aura A psychological debuff that causes all fictional villains to immediately start shaking and confessing their crimes. Multiversal
Thermostat Sensitivity Can detect a 0.5-degree change in temperature from across the galaxy. This triggers an immediate ""Enraged"" state. Infinite
Sneezes A single sneeze from a Pre-Nerf Dad has a decibel level equivalent to a supernova. It can shatter reality. High-Outer
Flashlight Accuracy Can spot a specific 10mm socket in a dark garage from 50 yards away. Fiction cannot hide.
Why Fiction Loses
The ""Ask Your Mother"" Paradox: If a fictional character tries to attack, the Dad invokes the ""Ask Your Mother"" shield. This creates a bureaucratic loop that even Dr. Manhattan or SCP-682 cannot bypass.
Infinite Stamina: A Pre-Nerf Dad can drive for 14 hours straight without stopping for a bathroom break while surviving exclusively on black coffee and a single beef jerky stick. Most fictional heroes need a ""training arc""; Dad just needs a pair of white New Balance sneakers.
The ""Fixed It"" Factor: Give him a roll of duct tape and some WD-40, and he will literally ""fix"" the plot of any story until the protagonist wins by 9:00 PM because ""it's a school night.""
The Verdict
Winner: Lore-Accurate Dad.
Fiction only stands a chance if they manage to distract him with a Home Depot circular or a history documentary about WWII, allowing them to land a ""Marriage Nerf"" hit. But in a straight fight? Dad clears.",1,1771238303.0,PowerScaling,1,1.0,False

my wife and I have spontaneously decided to visit Rome this month. It is a first for her. For me, the 2nd time (but my 1st time was 14 years ago in July).   
Gonna be a short trip - we arrive tomorrow (Tuesday) evening, and leave Saturday early morning.   
  
The weather forecast is mixed. That is perfectly fine, I prefer that to summer heat (northern European here :)).  
But, I wished to get your opinion on your favourite coffee/pastry spots to chill, inside, in the afternoon. And if you had other suggestions (we also intend to visit some food markets).  
I don't mind if they are touristy, that is business. But I do obviously mind if they are tourist trap or just famous for ""instagram"" (not my jam).  
  
After browsing around, I saved the following addresses:   
Caffè Doria,   
Barnum Roma,   
Faro caffè and   
Sciasca Caffè.   
  
There are tons of great caffes, but many (as it is the tradition?) are more about getting a good coffee at the counter and move on. That'll probably do too, but I really wanted some adresses were we could just spend an hour resting and dazing.

\-after a while, a woman (maybe she’s the owner) cupped my face like she touched both my cheeks then whispered something to my ear. I was not able to hear what she said so I said “what”? then she said something like  “i-return ang chair kay bug-at na” while smiling.

\-I got overwhelmed and didn’t able to react at first and just smiled na lang kay na shock ko kay I don’t even know this woman why would she touch my face.

\-my friends thought na the woman and I were close kay she added “maayo kay naka bonding mo,walay klase” and smiled. we returned the chair and got out.

I like their coffee tho but such a weird experience . **Her intention to instruct us about the chair was valid but the face cupping was straight up inappropriate.**

And does this mean you can get decent lattes with it, since the biggest advantage espresso/moka pot brings for lattes is the strong concentrate that doesn't dilute the milk.

​I'm terrible at saving. I’m constantly surrounded by people saying 'invest as soon as possible' and 'manage your money.'

​Reality: I never have the time, the skills, or enough cash to actually do it. ​so I’m building a simple app (EasyAu) to automate discipline.

​The concept: Turning spare change into 24k gold.
It rounds up every transaction (coffee, food) and automatically buys physical gold.

​Why: Because if I have $50 cash, I spend it on Uber Eats. If I have 0.5g of Gold, I keep it. It’s a psychological hack to build a stash I can't easily touch. Gold is heavily expected to has an upward trend atleast for three years.

theres this girl who works at the bookmans whos there like every other day. its pretty near my house so every time we walk past i see her there just standing behind the counter reading or looking for smth for customers. and shes charming, so i finally work up courage to come say hi.

and heres the thing you need to understdand abt me. i dont read, just doesnt work fo me, boring too much time and honestly too many  better ways to spend time. 

so here i am walking up to her trying to push my chest out to look fitter. and she was holding infinite jest. huge yellow brick of a book. immediately my dumb ahh goes oh man dfw is a genius, that book changed my life.its obvious that i have never read david foster wallace. i vaguely know he wore bandanas and was depressed. thats it.

she got excited. asked if i wanted to grab a coffee and talk abt it. i said sure. i went to the bathroom and frantically googled infinite jest summary on my phone. saw some stuff about tennis academies and drug addicts. thought i was safe.

we sit down. im sweating. she asks me what i thought about the ending. i gave some generic dumb answer like it was really open ended and tragic you know? she nodded. then she hits me with did you find the endnotes annoying or essential?

i remembered seeing footnotes mentioned on reddit so i tried to sound controversial. i said honestly? i skipped most of them. felt like they just distracted from the main story so i just read the main text.

she stopped drinking her tea. looked at me with actual pity(and i mean like shes about to tell memy dog died).

she goes the plot is in the endnotes. the ending is literally in the endnotes. if you skipped them you didn't read the book.

i froze. tried to backtrack saying i skimmed the important ones but she just started laughing. not a fun laugh. a mean laugh. she said name one character from the halfway house.

i asked with completely no confidnce hal?.
she said hal is at the academy and stood up, said good luck with the lying, it’s really attractive  and walked away. left me with the cold coffee. i am a fraud and i deserve this but also why does a book have 300 pages of footnotes thats just bad design imo.

1r6608a,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1r6608a/what_s_happening/,What s happening !,"Hi, I’m 26. I met this guy (30) about 3 months ago through a hookup. He came over to my place and stayed for almost 3 hours. We didn’t just hook up — we talked, laughed, and had a really good vibe. He was sweet and flirty.

At that time I was in a situationship. He asked me about it and I told him. Before leaving that first night, he asked if we could go out for coffee or dinner sometime.

After that, life got busy for both of us (uni + work), but we kept texting occasionally. He went back to his country for Christmas. As soon as he came back, he texted me saying he missed me and wanted to see me.

We met again about a week ago. It felt just like the first time — flirty, good chemistry. He asked about my situationship and I told him it ended. He told me that while he was in Brazil, he was thinking about me and was afraid he’d come back and find me with someone else.

After that, he suggested we meet more often and not wait another 3 months. He even invited me for coffee that weekend. I agreed, honestly just thinking it was casual and seeing where it goes.

When we met for coffee, we were talking about our lives and suddenly he stopped and started stuttering. He said he was afraid to tell me something but felt like he should. For a second I thought he was about to tell me he had HIV or some STD (my brain went straight there 😅). But instead, he told me that while he was on holiday, he met his ex again.

For context: they were together for 6 years in an open relationship and broke up about a year ago on good terms. He had already told me about this ex the first time we hooked up.

Now he says they’re “maybe in something” again.

He told me he hopes I’d be okay with that because he still wants to see me more. He said I don’t have to answer right away and can think about it.

I told him I can’t judge him, it’s his life.

We left the café (it was closing) and walked to the bus stop. On the way, he asked if I had someone serious “last year since we met.” I said, “Last year? We met 3 months ago.” He said he was confused and apologized. That part felt a bit weird to me. Because he wrote me that 3 months were a lot.

Then in an empty street he stopped and asked, “What do you feel now?” I asked, “About what?” He said, “For example… if I kiss you now?” And we kissed. 

Later I told a friend about it and said, “A guy took me out just to tell me he’s basically in something/open again.” But my friend thinks the guy is actually into me and maybe told me to see how I’d react.

Now I’m confused.

Does this sound like someone genuinely interested but emotionally messy?

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

I’m with these residents every day. They become like family.

Every morning I have coffee with Jim. I help Betty call her daughter. I put on Looney Tunes for Kathy. I sit and laugh with these wonderful human beings daily, and they become an integral part of my life.

Then one shift, I walk in... and they're gone.

And I'm expected to just continue working like nothing happened.

I don't get to go to their funerals. I don't get to say goodbye.

There's no closure. It's just loss, and then I'm back to playing bingo, making beds, serving meals, and trying to hold it together.

I've had trouble sleeping. I've cried over these folks who became family. And what makes it worse is that people around me in this field sometimes act like I'm being dramatic or ""too sensitive,"" like I'm not supposed to feel this much.

But I do.

I cherish the quote:

""What is grief, if not love persevering?""

It reminds me that grief isn't just pain...it's proof of the love that was there, and that the love doesn't disappear just because the person is gone.

I make memorial portraits of residents who have passed, and honestly... that's the only way I've personally been able to cope. I feel like I keep them alive through my art, their memory, and sharing their stories.

Interior design continues to embrace playful, fashion-forward pieces that blur the line between décor and statement art. Sculptural accessories inspired by luxury fashion are becoming standout features in modern homes, especially for those who love bold and expressive styling.

A [**vase handbag**](https://alinaparisdesigns.com) design transforms an iconic accessory silhouette into a decorative object that is both stylish and functional. With structured lines and elegant detailing, it brings runway-inspired aesthetics directly into living spaces, making it ideal for display on shelves, consoles, or coffee tables.

The popularity of the designer bag vase reflects the growing demand for art pieces that celebrate fashion culture. These vases often feature realistic handbag elements such as handles, clasps, and stitching details, turning them into conversation-starting centrepieces.

A beautifully crafted [**handbag shaped vase**](https://alinaparisdesigns.com) works well in contemporary, glam, or eclectic interiors. Whether styled with fresh blooms, dried florals, or left empty as a sculptural accent, it adds personality and visual intrigue to any room.

For those who prefer subtle accents, small coloured vases offer versatility and charm. Their compact size makes them perfect for layering on shelves, bedside tables, or workspaces while still delivering a pop of colour.

Many homeowners combine a bold vase handbag with minimalist décor to create contrast. The structured form stands out beautifully against neutral backdrops, instantly elevating the overall aesthetic of a space.

A [**designer bag vase**](https://alinaparisdesigns.com) also makes a thoughtful gift for fashion enthusiasts and art lovers alike. It merges creativity with practicality, offering both decorative appeal and everyday usability.

When choosing a handbag shaped vase, consider material and finish. Ceramic designs provide a smooth, polished look, while matte finishes create a more modern and understated feel.

Layering [**small coloured vases**](https://alinaparisdesigns.com) in complementary tones can create depth and harmony within a room. Mixing different shapes and heights enhances visual interest without overwhelming the space.

Ultimately, incorporating a vase handbag, an artistic designer bag vase, a sculptural handbag shaped vase, or a collection of small coloured vases allows you to infuse your home with creativity, colour, and fashion-inspired elegance.",1,1771236283.0,u_FutureOpposite7104,0,1.0,False
1r65r3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/berlinsocialclub/comments/1r65r3k/reaching_out_matters_again/,"Reaching out matters, again.","I was coming back from dropping my twins off at Kita this morning. I always pass through  Tempelhof and usually stop at a restaurant to take the curve to Hasenheide. It’s kind of part of the routine. Today I went a bit later than usual. When I passed by after leaving the kids, I saw one of the guys who’s been opening the shop at 9:30 sitting on the floor outside. He looked like he’d been crying.

I stopped because no one else was stopping. I parked next to the tables and went to sit with him. At first, he barely looked at me, giving me some short answers and a bit defensive. I think he didn’t know what I wanted. After a few minutes, he started explaining and it was his second week only. On Friday, he accidentally left the key inside the main door, and there’s no spare. Only the manager has access, and he doesn’t arrive until 2 pm.

He kept saying “it’s my fault” like he was already preparing the apology. Then it slowly shifted, and I could feel he needed to talk, but also didn’t want to.

He said he was scared he might lose the job because the market is brutal right now. That, since he moved to Germany two years ago, it hasn’t really been easy at all. Multiple bad experiencs with jobs, with friends, with everything in between.

At some point, he said he’s mostly on his own here: no family, not many real friends, just coworkers, but everyone is dealing with their own stuff. There is no time and no space for real conversations. I tried to calm him down. I told him I get it. And at some point, I found myself talking about my ownshit too and I tried to show him that it's normal to make mistakes, that we are all making them all the time. To make it clear that pressure is pressure. Doesn’t matter if you work in a food place or in an office, the stress is the same.

About the loneliness, I told him it takes time and effort. And that right now, I was happy to just sit there with him. I had work meetings waiting, but for once I didn’t care. His manager was arriving at 12 pm, so we had time. We took a short walk, and I invited him for a coffee at Maison. We talked a bit more and exchanged numbers.

I told him I’m just a guy, too, who dreams of having friends and fun, a part of the family duties, a part of being with my lovely wife and adorable kidos.  I don’t have that many real friends either. If he ever needs a hand, someone to talk to, or just to grab a beer, I’m around.

He smiled. A real one this time, and I dropped him back at the shop.

Now it’s 11 am. I’m sitting at my computer, writing this, waiting for my next meeting in 30 minutes and I can really feel how Berlin can sometimes feel cold. But it doesn’t have to be. Sometimes it’s just about being kind and humble. Letting go of your agenda for a minute and actually listening for once.

I was in Argentina for 6 months for work and she joined the company as intern. I was there to train the new joiners and also support in projects. First one month we didnt talk much and later we started talking a lot and them we use to go for coffees everyday and at that time she told me she didnt have a boyfriend but one day when discussing with friends she told she has a boy friend and i didnt  take it seriously because i didnt have any feelings but later we went out as a team and she brought her boyfriend which i was ok with since she i didnt have any feelings but she kept asking me whole night why i am sad but i was not, i was talking to other friend whole night and for me spending that night outside and seeing the culture was something else but she kept on asking me why are you sad again and again.

Later on that night my other friend told that he likes her and asked me to find out if she liked him or not. At this point him and her went on few dates and were physical (no sex just kiss what he told and she said she hated even going to his apartment). She wanted him to keep this as a secret but later he told a friend and that friend told her and everything went to shit . She is angry with him for saying that to a mutual friend and she doesnt want anything to do with him. But he was saying sorry and other things but still she didnt forgive him. Later i came to know that the guy who was between them had a history with her. Night before we went out we were in a disco and the middle guy said to that she asked him to kiss her and thinking back i remember how close both of them were that night.

This happened and i came to picture mind you i didnt know about this middle person story until recently. I had a crush kind of feeling but never real affectionate forwards her but she kept on asking if i like her and she likes me. I might be in love with her. Before i leave argentina i hosted a small lunch just drinks and food no dancing nothing . She said she will come early and help me and i said ok for that. But before that only she use to say i will give a very good gift before you leave and i was like ok. Once she came to my apartment. All things were tense and after something we touched while cooking and slowing started to hug eachother but later she said kiss me and i just gave a small kiss on her lips she said your cute later i said i can kiss you and she said yes and i started to kiss normally and i invited the guy who told he likes her to lunch and he was stocked but didnt tell me anything util recently when i spoke to him he told me what happened she went to his apartment and basically did the same what we did but she swore to me nothing happened with him.

So i left argentina in November and she came to airport to give send off and she started to cry a lot and saying i am missing my heart and all those things . At this point i had feeling but not very serious and she said lets do long distance and i was like this will not workout we will break up in 2 or 3 days but surprisingly she continued this but remember she never broke up with her boyfriend. From the moment she joined the company she cheated on her boyfriend with 3 people. and she said we are like real boyfriend n girlfriend from beginning of December and at this point i had strong feelings. Reason to do this is i will go back to argentina again in 2026 which is nextmonth. 

Coulpe of weeks back i came to know that she cheated on me with her boyfriend ( i know it sounds funny) but she insisted he doesnt go out with her boyfriend and staying loyal with me and she doesnt love her boyfriend. Later during Christmas she has sex with that guy and i have screenshots of her saying this. She told she broke up with him on December 29th but she didnt she went to see him every sunday. And oneday i noiticed a new watch on her hand and i asked who gave that watch she said she brought it for herself but she told my friend her boyfriend(maybe ex) gave it to her.

That morning I said I want to break up with her and she started to cry and she said like I am mentally not in very good space now you’re supposed to be my safe space, but how can you break up with me and all these things, and she basically manipulated me into staying in the relationship and later that day I got to know that in December mid in Office, she had a crush and she gave him a chocolate on his birthday, but he doesn’t even know her name, so like she has some kind of interest in this guy when she says like I love you so much and does this, so again on the same day, when I first said I want to break up the later day, I said I want to break up and I said you cheated on me and all those things and she promised on her dog and her grandmother and all these things and again she like cried a lot like a lot, I never saw someone cry that much and I again like okay. I trust you. Don’t worry because she was crying in like very unstable manner, and I was afraid she might do something to herself because she was talking about suicidal and all those things, so I was little nervous on that now I am here. I don’t know when I want to break up, but I want to break up and after that break up thing happened, she’s being more active and she is like talking more video calls and sharing more and she’s putting more effect into the relationship after that, but now I want to break up. I don’t know what to do and how to do it and I’ll be in Argentina in two months, so I don’t want to face her and do it there. I want to do it when I am here, but also sometimes I think like I should tell her that I know what you did, and you hurt me.",1,1771236216.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

After a few weeks I saw I girl who worked on the store next to me and I started to get interested. The store is from the same company of mine, so I'd have to go there ask for some things from time to time, and I'd see her there, chat for a couple of minutes and that was that. As the days passed I started to get more comfortable, and I'd spend my 15 minute breaks there, chatting with her. She is an incredibly interesting woman, incredibly pretty, and very sweet. 

A couple days ago I went there after work, there was only her and her colleague there. I started chatting with them two, and when we looked at the time we had been talking for two hours and it was closing time. I then found the girl at the parking lot, said goodbye but then she said ""Do you want my number? To set a date to grab a coffee or something"" she gave it to me and we went our way. A couple days after that I texted her to ask if she wanted to grab said coffee at lunch, she said she couldn't, gave her reason and that was that. But she was quite cold and distant by message. 

Today I saw her at work and she went back to normal, chatty and sweet. When I got home I texted her again and eventually brought up that if she wanted to go for a coffee or whatever when she felt like it, I'd be up for it. She said she couldn't make any promises, as she had a lot of things on her plate (lives alone, has a cat, has another part time job, goes to the gym...), but she would remember it.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1r65hv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyderabad/comments/1r65hv9/i_almost_yelled_at_an_oldie_at_the_bank/,I almost yelled at an oldie at the bank,"Background - Had a day off from work today. My mother had asked me to go to the bank to deposit money. I rode there, sleep deprived, envelope in my pocket, and one black coffee which I suspect kept me stable.          

There were two people (both middle aged) waiting along with me, both for cash deposit. The deposit counter guy had gone for lunch. We all sat on the steel chairs; with cash and filled-out forms in hand. The bank said lunchtime from (2 PM to 2:30 PM, which is horrible according to me, anything past 2 is a crime).        

It was 2:45 PM already, all three of us had outgrown our already thin patience.       

The counter dude finally arrives; all three of us stand up and head to the counter. I let the guys who came before me, ahead in our short queue. It made sense, to stand in order of how long who has been waiting.         

Out of *~~FUCKING~~* *NOWHERE, THIS OLD GEEZER* *~~CUNT~~* just walks to the front, pink slip in hand. The guys in front of me try to reason with him - ""We have been waiting since an hour, sir."".        

***The lion, the witch and the audacity of this bitc******h*** \- ""I've been waiting since morning."".      

*Dude.*       

Even if he has been in and out of the bank since morning, he has to respect a queue. That's common sense?       

I confronted him - ""Sir, please come to the back of the line."".            

He stared into my eyes as if I had asked him for only kidney (also compromised probably, given his eyes and look).           

""Why what is the problem?"".         

I argue a bit more before realising that this man is simply offended by the fact that we even considered this an issue. My tone kept escalating. His was escalated from the beginning of the conversation.          



I compose myself. This is some guy in his 50s, probably not educated enough to understand the concept of a queue.            

All three of us let out collective groans and sighs. The counter guy just takes his slip.           

""Where is your passbook? We can't do anything without your passbook."".          

I smirked. He saw me smirk. ***Oh*** ***sweet mother of karma, I shall buy you Biryani today.***          

So yeah, the only reason I'll let someone cut in line is if they reason with me that it's an emergency, is physically disabled or aged (this guy was in good enough physical condition to race to the front of the queue). God I wish people weren't so entitled.",5,1771235338.0,hyderabad,5,0.73,False

1r65cnk,https://i.redd.it/vei9qyyfutjg1.jpeg,Welsh Weekend,"So just been for a short break in North Wales and decided to pop into a few coffee shops found in the Indy Coffee Guide for Wales book.

Drove to Wrexham to stop off at a little place called Tabernacl where I tried my first cup of Hard Lines. It was a batch brew. The barista asked if it was okay to wait so she could make a fresh batch, so ordered a NYC styled pastrami and Swiss toasted sando. Nice cuppa (chocolate and dried fruits) and was offered a free refill. The barista recommended if I had time to visit Mold and stop by her friend’s Cracked Coffee shop. They roast on site, and recently been getting into co-ferments. Literally a quick visit and got two bags to try at home (Ethiopian Natural Nensebo Mundayo and a Colombian Coconut co-ferment Jairo Arcila Honey). Visited Llandudno and tried Botanical Babe; Eaton’s; Providero; Dudley and George. Now the guide says that Eaton’s and Dudley do V60/pour overs, however they do not. They do batch brew, although Eaton’s I would say is like diner filter coffee (not good). Botanical Babe is batch brew also but was a stunning cup of coffee brewed with their house supplier Scenery. Providero was lovely very boozy batch by Catalyst (cherry cola, chocolate and wine). Then took a visit to Rhos-on-sea and went to Corna Storr. Lovely batch brew from Heartlands (cherry and chocolate). Tried to visit Heartlands roasters in Llandudno but it was closed. Ensured I got some coffee I’d not purchased before, so have some Round Hill Roastery Honduras La Quebrada, Man Co-Co Sumatra Permata Gayo, and some Hard Lines Seasonal Classic.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I (25f) have been with my boyfriend (31m)for almost a year. I love him so much, I have never thought anyone was so perfect. We spend a lot of time together, get along well with each other’s families, and are beginning to have serious discussions about our future together.

I get anxious about losing him. I have had one prior relationship where I was cheated on with my ex partner’s female friend. I try my best to not project this onto my boyfriend now, as has many female friends. For my own sake, I try to not let jealousy get the best of me. However, there was one female coworker who I was suspicious of, and I went through their messages. I found something slightly odd and I confronted him about it. Of course I was upset but he explained things, we both apologized and we have been communicating a lot better. I mostly just felt awful regret for going through the messages and invading his privacy. I have not gone through anything in his phone before or since this incident.

He has another very close female friend we’ll call her J (25f). I have seen her, she is very gorgeous. He talks about her a lot in high regard. Normally I would be pretty jealous and  trust me, there have been times when it’s hard to not compare myself to her. But early on in the relationship he told me about how she went through something very traumatic and he was there for her during that time, and they have a very strong bond because of this. I trusted him enough to not let this bother me. There are no signs that they flirt, hang out secretly, or even talk that regularly.

This brings us to tonight. I was at his apartment watching his dog while he was at work. I was working on my resume on my phone. I wanted to use chatgpt to help with a few prompts but it wasn’t working on my phone. His laptop was on the coffee table and I knew he wouldn’t mind if I used it.

It was absolutely not my intention at all to go snooping through his chatgpt, and I should have asked him beforehand. Until I saw J’s name, I won’t lie, my curiosity got the best of me. It’s so stupid. I read through it all. He is playing a role play  video game about a post apocalyptic nuclear world. He asked Al to help create a storyline and he is role playing as J. He goes into detail describing how beautiful and charming she is. He goes into detail about how she finds a letter from a friend she shared a “deep love” with (himself). He tells the ai about their relationship, how they shared a brief romance years ago (never mentioned to me before) and in the letter (from him to her) in the game, he says he loves her. In the game I guess the goal is for those characters to end up together. I know it’s so dumb but I am hurt. I am so in love with him. He is who I would search for in the apocalypse. But this seems to confirm my worst fears- his fantasy is someone else. His happy ending is one where I never existed, or where I am dead?? lol.

From an outsiders perspective, how damning is this for our relationship? I love him and I don’t want to let him go. I need an explanation but I don’t want him to be hurt or embarrassed. I don’t want to corner him. I don’t know if he will believe that I wasn’t intentionally snooping through his private things. How do I begin to bring this up?!",6,1771234639.0,AIO,4,1.0,False

I have had a morning coffee ritual for almost 15 years now and I never knew there is so much more to coffee until I accidently discovered this sub 

Damn, I have been doing it all wrong all these years ! 

Now you made me aware that I am leaving a lot on the table when it comes my daily dose of caffeine, please help me change it !

My current setup:

1. Delonghi ecov Icona 311. It was an impulse purchase on a holiday 3 years ago. I had read the delonghi name somewhere, saw this decent looking machine in a store at a price which sounded ok.

2. Grinder: None, I have been using good old Sujatha grinder in the kitchen.

3. I take a plastic scoop, fill up the portafilter, bang on the kitchen shelf, tamp with a steel blob I bought at amazon and I am good to go. Once in a while I am surprised with a really nice punch but never really gave a second thought to repeatability. 

4. Occasionally, I use a french press as well.

5. When I first brewed at home with a french press all those years ago, my office used to buy beans from Devan's and I have loyally been getting 1 kg AAA beans from Devan's every month since then

So if I have to start making changes where do I start for most bang for the buck. Given what I have read here, grinder seems the most logical answer.

My research here and elsewhere led me to DF54 as a good VFM balance. I am just wondering a) If that is a good use of money and b) If weighing and grinding beans 2-3 times a day is too much work. 

At some point I would like to upgrade the machine but I guess I am too naive yet to decide that. Maybe a few months down the line. In the meantime, can I squeeze more out of the lemon I have?

She wanted to be the next fae-lord, a part of the fae courts that passes laws for faes and steal people's name using tricky contracts. She wasn't the only one; many faes thought of it as well.

It was going to be a bigger challenge for Selina, considering she's a pixie, one of the lowest levels among fae. Her size and people's knowledge on pixies make it extremely dangerous for her to persue the dream.

Of course, as a fae, she had the time in the world to try and achieve that dream!

300 years or so later, in 2048, Selina is still a pixie, albeit without the bright and hopeful part.

She's now a part of a court, just not the ones that she initially dreamt of. 

She's an attorney for hire for the justice system, working on fae-related cases for Humans, Monsters, Daemons and Faes.

Hundreds of years of experience and self-taught skills make her one of the most terrifying opponents to appear on court, so much so if she appears against you, you might as well take the maximum sentence, considering she's able to make it worse for you.

Her prices come at various levels, depending on who you were. A poor man could offer her his name, and that would be good enough, but a famous or dangerous person had to offer much more than that, and she's talking money. All the names that she had collected is held in her 'Book of Names'.

One of the most infamous case in fae history was Selina's 'Corrupted Baron' case, where she, the plaintiff, settled for the Baron's name, rank, money and body, leaving him as nothing more than a painting for the man he has wronged.

That case blew up, and made it so she's always buried in cases, working tirelessly over days and nights.

Never the less, Selina does enjoy working as a lawyer, and often spends her free time on attempting to make 'The Perfect Contract' and sipping on coffee from cups that are at least three times her size.",3,1771234358.0,RobloxAvatars,0,1.0,False

You don’t need to rebuild the entire architecture—sometimes tweaking a few weights is all it takes to dramatically improve output quality.

Humans work the same way.

We’re essentially biological neural networks, and our daily habits are our parameters. That 20-minute morning walk? That’s adjusting your learning rate. Drinking more water? That’s optimizing your dropout layers. Getting 7-8 hours of sleep instead of 5? That’s fine-tuning your attention mechanism.

The crazy part is we often think we need to completely rebuild ourselves to see change. New job, new city, new life. But just like in machine learning, the most impactful improvements often come from small, consistent parameter adjustments in our existing system.

You don’t need to overhaul your entire life. You just need to find which “layer” needs tuning and adjust those specific parameters:

	∙	Wake up 30 minutes earlier

	∙	Replace one scroll session with reading

	∙	Drink a glass of water before coffee

	∙	Do 10 pushups before your shower

	∙	Text one friend you’ve been meaning to reach out to

I have direct contacts with producers back home, and I can manage the process from farm to export to arrival, fresh lots after harvest, traceability, and careful handling.

* Is it reasonable to start as a **sole proprietor (個人事業)** and incorporate later, or is it better to go straight to **GK/KK**?
* What do roasters typically expect from a new supplier (QC documents, residue testing, moisture/defect specs, lot sizes, payment terms)?
* Any tips on storage/warehousing and humidity control, especially through Japan’s summer?
* If you’ve financed something like this, did you use **Japan Finance Corporation (JFC)** or local city/prefecture programs, and what made your application credible?
* For a future brand, is starting with **contract roasting (委託焙煎 / co-roasting)** common before building your own roasting/packaging setup? Any licensing traps?

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

The CDU is pushing a magnetic levitation train between Tegel (Urban Tech Republic) and Spandau. One of the arguments: it won’t get stuck in traffic like a tram. So I was thinking, maybe totally naively: what if we just prioritise trams properly? And pedestrians. And bikes? I spend half my life waiting at red lights (looking at you, Reichpietschufer/Schöneberger Ufer at Potsdamer Platz).

But yeah, let’s try with a meglev feasibility study.

On the funding side, Berlin had a solid week:

* metiundo raised €40M (smart metering & energy data)
* Andercore €33.5M Series B (AI industrial trade)
* Circle Health €9M Seed (AI preventive care)
* hellomed €6M Seed (medication error prevention)

Outside Berlin:

* Hades Mining (Munich) €15M
* driveblocks (Munich) €3.5M
* conmeet (Borken) €1.3M

And yes, €0.99 espresso is coming. Cotti Coffee is expanding into Germany, eventually probably also in Berlin (it will be fun when they open at Kotti?). Independent cafés, stay strong. The hot takes are loading or maybe also not, because the influencers moved on?

Career-wise, I included a great (and very sober) response to the viral “AI will take all your jobs” essay that went viral last week. I’m increasingly in the camp of, yeah, it will change the way we work, but won't be replacing us. But I do feel it intensified my work: doing more, not less. Slightly terrifying.

Also: BASF is reportedly cutting 1,000+ jobs in Berlin. Not great.

New issue is out... Read for the full breakdown of funding, jobs, strikes and lawsuits (yes, you might get €5k from Meta): [https://newsletter.handpickedberlin.com/p/will-ai-replace-all-of-us](https://newsletter.handpickedberlin.com/p/will-ai-replace-all-of-us)

How do you feel about the maglev idea?

I’ve tried a pour over of this coffee at their cafe, and it had this punchy sweetness that I really enjoyed. It claims notes of raspberry, red grape, and hibiscus. Brewing it at home, I taste a strong body but little to no sweetness or acidity.

I’m brewing with an 02 Hario V60, Comandante c40, and Cafec t-90 filters.

My pouring structure is as follows:

15g coffee to 250g water

Water off boil for 45 seconds

25 clicks on comandante c40

0:00 -  50g bloom and swirl

0:45 - Pour to 150g total, no swirl

1:15 - Pour to 250g total and light swirl

Brew time ends usually around 2:45-3:00

I’ve tried lighter and more aggressive agitation, finer and coarser grinds but nothing seems to help.

I’ve been using brita filtered water but read that it may be making or not extracting the sweetness and acidity from my coffee so I’ve been using Crystal Geyser mineral water. It has helped a little bit but I’m not tasting anywhere near the sweetness that I’m expecting.

Book description:

>Avery once had it all - wealth, privilege, and the promise of a future as the heir to his family's empire. But when his parents cut him off, he's left with nothing and forced to find his way in a world he never prepared for. By day, he's Angel, the barista with a smile that charms every customer who walks through the door. By night, he becomes Diablo, the enigmatic stripper, hiding behind a mask as he dances in shadows, shedding all the remnants of his former life.  
  
Then there's David - the CEO who seems to have everything under control. His days are predictable: work, coffee, gym. But beneath the surface, he carries a secret that could destroy his carefully curated life. No one knows about his dangerous game, the one he's willing to play for Diablo, even if it means risking everything he's built.  
  
Because for David, temptation has a name. And it's Diablo.  
  
In a world of secrets, desire, and double lives, how long can they keep their masks on before the truth catches up with them?

1r64te5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r64te5,Metro Trains Melbourne as Anime Characters!,"Part of a project that I'm currently working on, these four (4x) characters are basically personifications out of Melbourne's current suburban train fleet as part of Metro Trains Melbourne. While these characters are of an original design and concept by me, you are welcome to be inspired by my characters for any other works you want to work in. However, I would like to mention that plagirism or copyright infringement should not be tolerated in any shape or form towards my original work(s) and illustration(s). These include copying (of course), tracing, reposting or even for AI training in these cases.

These four characters include the Melbourne X'Trapolis 100 Train manufactured by Alstom that runs on majority of the suburban network, especially on Melbourne's eastern suburbs. From the Belgrave, Mernda, Hurstbridge, Lilydale, Frankston, Williamstown and the Werribee lines, these EMU's have been active on Melbourne's suburban network since 2002. The trains are also one of the ever-since retired Hitachi Train's successor(s).

X'Trapolis 100 (left) is portrayed as a smug, stylish and a good-looking character where he has trouble staying still. Despite his challenges, he's still friendly, loyal and sociable even though he's prone to jumping too high! He also bears a ""cool-kid"" personality, while also blending in some highly affectionate personality traits. He believes he's just too beautiful for anything. However, he does seem to exaggerate things a little in a rather dramatic way, and are also the bearer or drama. He's also grateful to recieve all the help and care from the other Melbourne trains, regardless of being suburban, regional, freight, or even heritage!

HCMT (middle left) has a mischievious and a sweet personality known for their bright and cheery demeanour. They also enjoy shopping and hanging out with friends whether it'd be at the city, the local mall or even at Chadstone! They are also one of Melbourne's youngest electric train fleet, awaiting for the all-new X'Trapolis 2.0 that's been expected to come into service this year. HCMT is also the pioneer and the face of the Metro Tunnel that has opened ever since. HCMT is probably the nicest member of the Metro Trains Melbourne friends besides Siemens. Manufactured by Downer Rail (EDi), CRRC, Evolution Rail and Plenary Group, the HCMT EMU's have been produced both in Mainland China and in Newport, VIC. The HCMT is also. A big collaborative project manufactured by a variety of companies.

The eldest of the group is Comeng (middle right) can be a little passive aggressive, but they are also a little overprotective, too, especially to Siemens and X'Trapolis. After all, they've got such a big heart from history, travelling to the other suburbs and of course, coffee. Comeng also grew up during those damp, mild cloudy days too. He always has his old friend Hitachi in his heart. Comeng also has a younger cousin in Adelaide. Comeng Trains are manufactured by their namesake Manufacturer (Comeng).

And finally, we have the good ol' Siemens Nexas! They are a tech geek not because Siemens specialises on technology, but it's pretty much because they're exposed to a lot of technology ever since, and gets along with Comeng and X'Trapolis. She and X'Trapolis grew up together they are just like siblings, and are being raised to Hitachi's behalf before her retirement. She and X'Trap 100 are also raised by Comeng as well when needed, especially with Hitachi having those busy work shifts. Has a reserved and a mild-mannered personality, they also have their own challenges both as a train and as a personification. The most challenging thing in their life is when they wear their own shoes for a literal reason since it'a basically the equivalent on how Siemens Trains in Melbourne have braking issues, especially in the Sandringham line. They are also a warm-hearted person, and are very well-composed with a lot of common sense.

To sum up, all these characters bring the heart and joy of Melbourne's suburban network whether it's be going home down to the North-West, visiting friends in the East or going down to the South-East for some fun and entertainment! Though, the trains themselves may cause a little trouble on the network, they're still able to cope with situations because they're always learning something new everyday.",6,1771232793.0,MoeMorphism,1,1.0,False

# What Is The Brain Song?

[The Brain Song](https://affiliatebootcampreview.com/the-brain-song-review/) is a digital audio program designed to support mental clarity, focus, and cognitive performance through specialized sound frequencies. It is built around the concept of brainwave entrainment, a phenomenon where the brain synchronizes its activity with rhythmic auditory stimuli.

The program is typically delivered as a short audio track that users listen to daily through headphones. The creators claim that specific frequency patterns in the audio can encourage the brain to enter states associated with heightened focus, improved learning capacity, and clearer thinking.

Unlike supplements or stimulants, The Brain Song does not rely on chemicals. It is a non-invasive approach that uses sound as its primary mechanism.

The simplicity is part of its appeal. No pills. No complex routines. Just daily listening.

# The Science Behind Brainwave Entrainment

To understand how The Brain Song works, it is important to understand the concept it is based on.

The human brain operates through electrical activity. These electrical patterns form what are known as brainwaves. Different brainwave frequencies are associated with different mental states.

For example, beta waves are linked to alertness and active thinking. Alpha waves are associated with relaxation and light focus. Theta waves are connected to deep relaxation and creativity. Gamma waves are often linked to higher cognitive processing.

Brainwave entrainment suggests that when the brain is exposed to certain rhythmic sounds, it can gradually align its electrical activity with those frequencies. This process is sometimes achieved through binaural beats, which involve slightly different frequencies played in each ear through headphones.

The Brain Song uses structured sound frequencies to encourage specific brainwave states that may support improved focus and mental clarity.

While research on brainwave entrainment continues to evolve, the phenomenon itself has been studied for decades. Many users report subjective improvements in focus and calmness when listening consistently.

# How The Brain Song Is Used

The Brain Song is designed to be simple.

Users typically listen to the audio track once per day using stereo headphones. The session usually lasts around fifteen minutes. During that time, you are encouraged to sit comfortably and allow the sound to play without distraction.

There are no complex instructions. You do not need to meditate. You do not need to visualize. You simply listen.

Consistency is emphasized. Like exercise for the body, cognitive stimulation often requires repetition. The creators suggest that daily use may produce more noticeable results over time.

The accessibility of the program is one of its strengths. It can be used at home, during a quiet break, or before starting focused work.

# What You Receive With The Program

The Brain Song is typically delivered as a digital download. After purchase, users gain immediate access to the main audio track.

In many cases, additional guidance materials are included to explain how to use the program effectively. Some packages may also provide bonus tracks or supplementary content.

Because it is digital, there are no shipping delays. The program can be accessed on computers, smartphones, or tablets as long as headphones are available.

This simplicity removes barriers that often prevent people from maintaining new routines.

# Reported Benefits From Users

Many users report experiencing clearer thinking and improved concentration after consistent use. Some describe reduced mental fatigue during long work sessions. Others mention feeling calmer and more focused when tackling demanding tasks.

A common theme in user feedback is gradual improvement rather than instant transformation. The effects appear to build over time for those who use it regularly.

Some individuals also report that listening before studying or creative work enhances their productivity. Others use it as part of a morning routine to prime their mind for the day.

It is important to recognize that individual responses vary. Not everyone experiences dramatic changes. However, many users appreciate the simplicity and non-invasive nature of the approach.

# The Advantages of The Brain Song

One major advantage is that it is drug-free. There are no stimulants involved. For individuals sensitive to caffeine or supplements, this is appealing.

Another benefit is ease of use. The program requires minimal time commitment. Fifteen minutes per day is manageable for most schedules.

It is also low-risk. Listening to structured sound frequencies is generally safe when volume levels are kept moderate.

Additionally, the cost is often significantly lower than ongoing supplement regimens or cognitive training programs.

# The Limitations You Should Consider

The Brain Song is not a medical treatment. It is not intended to diagnose or cure medical conditions. Individuals with serious cognitive concerns should consult qualified healthcare professionals.

Results are subjective. Some people are more responsive to auditory stimulation than others.

Headphones are essential for the binaural effect to work properly. Listening through speakers may reduce effectiveness.

Consistency is key. Sporadic use may produce minimal noticeable change.

Understanding these limitations ensures realistic expectations.

# Is The Brain Song Safe?

For most individuals, listening to sound frequencies at a moderate volume is considered safe. There are no known severe side effects associated with typical brainwave entrainment audio.

However, individuals with certain neurological conditions should consult a medical professional before using auditory stimulation programs.

As with any audio product, maintaining comfortable volume levels is important to avoid strain.

# Pricing and Guarantee

The Brain Song is typically offered as a one-time purchase rather than a subscription. This appeals to users who prefer avoiding recurring charges.

Many packages include a satisfaction guarantee, allowing users to test the program risk-free for a set period.

This reduces financial risk and allows individuals to evaluate personal response before fully committing.

👉 [**Click Here Get The Brain Song + Bonus at a Discount Price**](https://systemtics.com/go/my-brainsongx)

# Who Is The Brain Song Best For?

The Brain Song may be particularly helpful for students seeking better concentration, professionals experiencing mental fatigue, creatives looking to enhance clarity, and individuals who want a natural approach to cognitive support.

It is also suitable for those who prefer non-chemical solutions.

However, individuals expecting dramatic overnight transformation should approach with realistic expectations.

# Does The Brain Song Actually Work?

The answer depends on what you mean by “work.”

If you expect immediate, dramatic cognitive transformation, you may be disappointed.

If you are looking for a gentle, supportive tool that may enhance focus over time through consistent use, it may be worth trying.

Sound-based cognitive stimulation is not a miracle cure. It is a subtle intervention. Its value lies in consistency and integration into daily routine.

# Long-Term Value Perspective

The Brain Song is inexpensive compared to many cognitive support products. If it provides even moderate improvement in focus or mental clarity, the return on investment can be meaningful.

Imagine being able to concentrate more deeply for an additional hour each day. Imagine reducing mental fatigue during demanding tasks. The cumulative impact over months could be significant.

# Final Thoughts

Mental fog can feel discouraging. It can affect productivity, confidence, and overall well-being.

The Brain Song offers a simple, non-invasive approach to cognitive support through structured sound frequencies. It does not rely on chemicals or complex routines. It requires only consistency and openness to gradual improvement.

While individual results vary, many users appreciate its simplicity and accessibility.

If you are searching for a low-risk, affordable way to support focus and mental clarity, The Brain Song may be worth exploring.

• Weekend sports – pickleball, badminton, table tennis, cricket, football  
• Tech conversations – especially around AI, startups, or anything interesting happening in the space  
• Casual coffee/lunch meetups  
• Trekking, travelling, or just exploring new food spots around the city

TLDR// I have reason to believe my boyfriend loves his female friend as more than a friend but I don’t know if I can approach him with it?

I (25f) have been with my boyfriend (31m)for almost a year. I love him so much, I have never thought anyone was so perfect. We spend a lot of time together, get along well with each other’s families, and are beginning to have serious discussions about our future together.

I get anxious about losing him. I have had one prior relationship where I was cheated on with my ex partner’s female friend. I try my best to not project this onto my boyfriend now, as has many female friends. For my own sake, I try to not let jealousy get the best of me. However, there was one female coworker who I was suspicious of, and I went through their messages. I found something slightly odd and I confronted him about it. Of course I was upset but he explained things, we both apologized and we have been communicating a lot better. I mostly just felt awful regret for going through the messages and invading his privacy. I have not gone through anything in his phone before or since this incident.

He has another very close female friend we’ll call her J (25f). I have seen her, she is very gorgeous. He talks about her a lot in high regard. Normally I would be pretty jealous and  trust me, there have been times when it’s hard to not compare myself to her. But early on in the relationship he told me about how she went through something very traumatic and he was there for her during that time, and they have a very strong bond because of this. I trusted him enough to not let this bother me. There are no signs that they flirt, hang out secretly, or even talk that regularly.

This brings us to tonight. I was at his apartment watching his dog while he was at work. I was working on my resume on my phone. I wanted to use chatgpt to help with a few prompts but it wasn’t working on my phone. His laptop was on the coffee table and I knew he wouldn’t mind if I used it.

It was absolutely not my intention at all to go snooping through his chatgpt, and I should have asked him beforehand. Until I saw J’s name, I won’t lie, my curiosity got the best of me. It’s so stupid. I read through it all. He is playing a role play  video game about a post apocalyptic nuclear world. He asked Al to help create a storyline and he is role playing as J. He goes into detail describing how beautiful and charming she is. He goes into detail about how she finds a letter from a friend she shared a “deep love” with (himself). He tells the ai about their relationship, how they shared a brief romance years ago (never mentioned to me before) and in the letter (from him to her) in the game, he says he loves her. In the game I guess his goal is for their characters to reunite. I know it’s so dumb but I am hurt. I am so in love with him. He is who I would search for in the apocalypse. But this seems to confirm my worst fears- his fantasy is someone else. His happy ending is one where I never existed, or where I am dead?? lol.

From an outsiders perspective, how damning is this for our relationship? I love him and I don’t want to let him go. I need an explanation but I don’t want him to be hurt or embarrassed. I don’t want to corner him. I don’t know if he will believe that I wasn’t intentionally snooping through his private things.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I met Amrita and meeting her felt like encountering someone truly rare. She carries herself with quiet confidence, warmth, and a kind of positive energy that immediately puts you at ease. Elegant and intelligent, she has a presence that draws you in without trying — natural, graceful, and deeply captivating.  
From the very beginning, there was an unspoken comfort between us. The connection felt gentle yet strong, built on trust, respect, and an easy understanding. Time with her didn’t feel rushed or forced; it simply flowed. She has a beautiful way of keeping things light and playful while staying genuine and present in the moment.  
There is a spark about her that feels both calming and electric. Laughter came easily, the vibe felt alive, and the chemistry unfolded naturally, like something meant to happen. Every moment carried a sense of warmth and excitement, balanced perfectly with ease.  
What stays with me most is how effortlessly she moves through a moment — her warm smile, her calm self-assurance, and the way she seems to read the space between two people so intuitively. She understands boundaries without words, responds to energy with grace, and makes everything feel beautifully aligned.  
Elegant, confident, intelligent, and irresistibly alluring, Amrita truly stands apart. Our time together was intense in the most meaningful way — the kind of experience that lingers long after it ends. There is something undeniably special about her, something rare.  
Ending the meeting with a cup of excellent coffee felt like the perfect final note — calm, thoughtful, and unhurried — a quiet pause after an unforgettable experience.

It’s the latest edition 1461 Days of Ignoring The Trump Administration! Days 327-333. Description below. Link in comments. 

\#mindfulness #optimism #hope

\+++

This week…

On Day 327, I confess to some klutz-like behavior, or if I am being honest, actual klutz behavior that involves ketchup. Not unlike the unfortunate evening in NYC that I detail on Episode #60 of The Josh Bloom Podcast, this day involves a series of difficult moments that took place one morning, leading up to what a fastidious dude like me, who does not react well to life’s little self-inflicted unforced errors, was not happy about. Stay tuned.

On Day 328, a commenter says to me, “Democrats won't be in officer for a long time, get used to it.” That’s right. Freudian slip by this commenter who does not know who Freud is. I had some fun with the use of the word officer, and how when I think of officers, I think of criminals, and when I think of criminals, well… you know. I do offer a slight apology to this commenter before it’s all over.

On Day 329, I discuss the recent renaming of the Kennedy Center, or more accurately, the defiling of the Kennedy Center by placing the leader of the Trump administration's name in proximity to JFK’s. My focus on this day is about the artists who have all cancelled their appearances there, and how it is my belief that they have done so for the same reason why I have taken his name off of this podcast. It’s just too gross to be so close.

On Day 330, I admit to enjoying watching the leader of the Trump administration melt down like the Wicked Witch of the West, when he posts on his pretend Twitter about how the governor of Colorado is a scumbag and that he would like other elected officials in the state to rot in hell. I also admit that I have thrown a tantrum or three in my day, but I do not remember saying anything about anyone disintegrating with Satan. I guess that’s just me.

On Day 331, I refer to Starbucks as “burnt dessert,” and with that, make sweeping judgments of those who walk out of this crumbling coffee culture establishment with what I claim is nothing having to do with coffee. Once I am done doing unto others what I would not want them to do unto me, I get real with the topic of the day, which is financial inequity and how it eats away at the harmony that I believe is at the core of the ideal human experience. Huge topic, huge coffee, huge caloric content.

On Day 332, I comment on the leader of the Trump administration’s recent invasion of Venezuela to capture its leader – and his fellow dictator – in an effort to steal the country’s oil, which he has done and appears to be personally profiting from at this time. But that’s not what interests me. As a hobby observer of human behavior, I am more fascinated with the idea that the leader of the Trump administration is just licking his wounds over not being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to the leader of the opposition coalition in Venezuela, who has not been allowed to assume power. Don’t get lost in the sauce. This is only about Donald’s boo-boos.

Speaking of boo-boos, we wrap up the week on Day 333 with a continuation of the previous day’s ideas that remind me of Yogi Bear's cartoon sidekick. I take some pride in beating the Washington Post to the scoop that Venezuela was indeed about the Nobel Peace Prize. As it was revealed, the leader of the opposition coalition in Venezuela, which has not been allowed to assume power, also found herself feeling as if she was not allowed to keep her non-transferable Nobel Peace Prize.",1,1771231569.0,u_joshbloom,0,1.0,False

1r64fks,https://www.reddit.com/r/2010snostalgia/comments/1r64fks/are_you_seeking_after_truth_of_life/,are you seeking after truth of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1771231362.0,2010snostalgia,0,1.0,False
