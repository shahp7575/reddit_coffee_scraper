I have worked as a chef in a commercial kitchen (food to order from websites). It became extremely overwhelming due to workload per person in the past few weeks (after the company got sold to a much bigger company) and I literally started panicking etc. whenever an evening came and I knew I have to go there the next morning.

I was under an enormous amount of stress basically, could barely sleep for a few weeks and so on and simply know that I won't be able to work 1 more day is said place. I honestly felt like a miserable s*it working there recently and the ignorant and very sarcastic new management wasn't helping my mental health either.

Anyway, I gave my resignation letter last Friday. The notice period is 4 weeks. 
I have been out sick due to work related stress for slightly over a week now and I already feel much better overall. I started sleeping normally again and feel happier.

I started applying to coffee shops and got an offer for an assistant manager position in one of them. 
The coffee shop in question is a small, private shop which isn't getting very busy etc. as I have been going there personally for quite some time to grab a coffee.

I know personally that this environment was and will be FAR less stressful for me; I've worked in coffee shops for quite a few years in the past and ended up in this current place simply due to being desperate while job hunting.


Could anyone possibly help me in this situation? What are my options? I have already mentioned in the resignation letter that I give it due to ""personal problems"" and that I will provide a doctor's note for the notice period.

I'd really appreciate some help, as I was never in such a situation before, but maybe someone else was and could potentially help me.

And I think that I came to a point that I'm greatly overthinking this whole situation?
To be honest, the managers didn't even reply to me after I send the resignation letter and I did it 5 days ago ü§î.",1,1740572299.0,LegalAdviceUK,3,1.0,False

He pressed a button and felt the BMW shift into four-wheel drive and grip the snow-packed road of the mountain‚Äôs pass. ‚ÄúThank you, darling,‚Äù he whispered. It was Foxy who had made the last-minute decision to purchase the studded snow tires that had become crucial in their frantic escape from under the surveillance of the sheriff‚Äôs department and the JTS goons.

Like everyone else, Mickey had fallen under the illusion that the beautiful waitress was just another stereotypical airhead‚Äîa nice set of jugs in an ass-gripping uniform serving coffee and hotcakes to the valley regulars.

He mentally kicked himself for not seeing it a long time ago, for lusting after her and objectifying her when, in reality, she was a highly intelligent woman with an incredible gift. That trick back at the gas station‚Äîhis body still tingled a little bit‚Äîwas all her, part of her magic. Now he realized it had been so from that day five years ago when she had poured him his first cup of coffee, licked her glittering lips, and called him _Shug_. She was working that magic, creating the reality in which she could live while hiding from those things‚Ä¶ those fucking monsters.

She slept now in the seat next to him, her features caressed by the soft glow of the dashboard; his companion, his co-conspirator. She had put herself in danger for the sake of Francis and the hope and promise of his music. Yet it wasn‚Äôt solely for this boy. He knew in his gut‚Äîit was also for him. For some inexplicable reason, this breathtaking damsel had taken a risk on a fat, bald lawyer from Nowhere, Montana. Now, like Alan, Wolf, and Francis, they were fugitives from justice. The understanding suddenly dawned that his old life was gone forever. He would never practice law again. At that instant, Mickey vowed that he would do anything to protect her.

The car behind him flashed its brights, its beams cutting through the snow. He decided he was just going to keep driving. They could either pass him or follow him. There was no way in hell he was going to pull over.

At that instant, his rear-view mirror lit up with red and blue flashing lights.

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù

He pulled to the side of the road and stopped. Behind him, the cop blasted a spotlight into his side mirror. He put his hands on the wheel and waited for the officer to knock on his window.

How had they caught them so quickly? No doubt, as soon as they realized he had made a run for it, they‚Äôd gone to all the rental agencies in town. From there, it would have been like putting a child‚Äôs puzzle together: off-grid rental, paid in cash under the name of the mother of the waitress he‚Äôd taken to the Halloween ball. How stupid could he be?

He could make a run for it, but even if he lost the cop, they would radio ahead and be waiting for him.

‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù

The spotlight went dark. The cruiser beeped its horn, swung around him, and took off up the pass.

‚ÄúChrist.‚Äù

Foxy turned in her sleep, her ample bosom rising and falling. He didn‚Äôt keep driving until he could no longer see taillights and no longer felt like a heart attack lurking just below the surface.

Thirty minutes later, he cleared the mountain pass. The snowstorm diminished to little angry flakes of ice, and a mile later to nothing. The mountains played their natural role of blocking the low-pressure systems from crossing into the flatlands of eastern Montana.

The highway stretched out long and far beneath him. The sky forward was speckled with stars like diamonds that faded into the horizon, back-lit by a moon on the verge of rising.

_Clear skies at night, Maji in flight_.

He drove in silence and stillness, taking comfort in the expanse of dark highway stretching to the future and to the past. He drove on as the first splinter of silver broke the far horizon of land and cloud. Larger and larger, it grew like the hump of a great whale diving into the cosmos, washing away the stars and revealing the prairie beneath its ascending glare.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt need to let me sleep,‚Äù Foxy said, arching her back.

He tried to look at her s-line and keep his eyes on the road at the same time.

‚ÄúEyes forward! You‚Äôre gonna get us killed.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. _You‚Äôre_ gonna get us killed.‚Äù He reached out to touch her. She captured his hand, guiding it to her tit. She was bra-less in a t-shirt.

‚ÄúYou like that?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúI do,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDamn, I wish my old man was alive to see you. He never would‚Äôve believed it. He thought I was gay for the longest time.‚Äù

‚ÄúForget him, baby.‚Äù She moved his hand over to her other breast and let him feel the rise of her nipple, then pushed him back and sat up. ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù

‚ÄúSome podunk back road out in the middle of nowhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow, the moon is so bright. It almost hurts my eyes.‚Äù

He drove with his headlights off. The old asphalt road glinted like a sterling ribbon out into the terrestrial sea before them. Only once did they spot a checkpoint on the highway that ran parallel, a long line of cars waiting to pass through a blaze of flashing red and blue lights.

Hours passed, and the gravel back road slowly angled toward the highway, where traffic now moved unobstructed. Ahead, he saw the on-ramp and pulled over on a turn-off.

‚ÄúWhy ya stopping?‚Äù asked Foxy.

‚ÄúNeed to drain the main vein.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúGotta take a piss, honey buns.‚Äù

With his dick in his hand, his shining stream of urine arched up and fell to the wayside. Even with the billions and billions of people on the earth, the vast emptiness of Montana never ceased to amaze him. So different from where he‚Äôd been raised. Hell, stop to take a piss back there, you‚Äôd be arrested and charged with a crime.

‚ÄúNo fair,‚Äù Foxy whined as he got back in. ‚ÄúYou men can go anywhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because we evolved as hunters. Always on the move, fighting off sabretooth tigers, we didn‚Äôt have time to squat, baby.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow, that sounds scientific. Sabretooth tigers?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust go behind the car, drop trou, and use the bumper for support.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so crude, dear.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nature, sweetie pie.‚Äù He chuckled as she got out and went to the back.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt peek!‚Äù she shouted.

A thought had occurred as an inkling in his mind since fleeing Polson, and it kept growing until it was as big and illuminating as the nighttime moon. Why not? Why the fuck not? The world was going to hell. Water levels were rising. States were leaving the union. A war that had continued for his entire life was only getting worse. A drug crisis. Climate refugees crossing the country looking for a place to call home. And a whole raft of other shit. Why the fuck not? If not now, when? Maybe never.

He got out of the car and met Foxy on her way back.

‚ÄúHey, I told you not to peek, you perv.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt peek.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it? Is everything okay?‚Äù

Her beauty caught in the moonlight made her appear like a marble statue.

‚ÄúFoxy.‚Äù Mickey Verona dropped to one knee on the gravel road before her, reaching up, he clasped her hand.

‚ÄúOh boy,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúFoxy, I‚Äôve loved you since that morning in Dee‚Äôs when you poured me my first cup of coffee. I‚Äôm not a perfect man‚Ä¶‚Äù He lost his words. ‚ÄúBut sometimes‚Ä¶ Hell, Foxy, will you marry me?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Mickey. I‚ÄîI mean, there‚Äôs so much about me you don‚Äôt know‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt told you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe move forward together.‚Äù

A tear rolled down her face, like a single star falling to Earth.

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù she said at long last. ‚ÄúYes. Yes, Mickey! I will marry you!‚Äù

She fell to her knees and kissed him. Her lips warm and moist, her breath fresh as the night. Somewhere in the far-off distance, a coyote yelped and howled, and then a dozen yelps and howls echoed in response.",1,1740572186.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1iym6b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysautonomia/comments/1iym6b8/vision_is_blurry_but_its_not/,Vision is ''blurry'' but it's not?,"I've been having this issue for almost two years now.

I randomly woke up one day and had this ''drunk'' feeling vision wise, where as soon as I stood up I lost balance, it was pretty severe the first 2 weeks. I'm not sure what could of triggered it at all. I was thinking to myself, wtf had just happened, I didn't feel sick at all but was really confused why I was seeing all dizzy without feeling dizzy at all.

Ever since then I've been having this issue although over time the effects have diminished, it still present.

I tend to notice it would flare up when I'm stressed, when something spontaneous would happen in life, my vision would start to become affected. Some days I have zero issues thinking the problem went away on it's own only for it to come back the day after, it would sometimes last a couple hours to the whole day, while Sleeping/napping would ''reset'' it.

I got my eyes checked out, have perfect vision, no issues reading up close, small letters far away etc.

It's just really hard to explain how my vision is affected in words, but it's like having drunk goggles on permanently if that makes sense, less severe, My balance doesn't seem to be affected it seems.

I tried doing vestibular exercise such as focusing my eyesight on my finger point out while turning my head left and right and it seems to affect it more the tighter I turn (Fully left/right).

Is it my vestibular vision? I feel concerned as I'm only 27 and If im having this type of health issues due to stress I'm worried about the future, I also have a clean diet, I cut out energy drinks, and haven't eaten junk food in years. I only drink water and coffee in the morning and afternoon If I need it.

I've also started driving lessons and passing my exam start of next month, but never disclosed I have it to either the instructors nor my parents for fear or making excuses and extending the dates. My driving doesn't seem to be affected as much but I won't lie in saying it's really annoying, I have to concentrate to the max which in return after 2 hours of driving lessons my symptoms appear without fail each time and lasts the whole day mostly, almost mid way through my lessons it appears, but like I said, it's no where near severe where I have to stop.",1,1740572171.0,dysautonomia,1,1.0,False

I finally met Jeremiah Weinberger.

He was standing at the bus stop, just like I‚Äôd seen him before. Tall, with dark hair and a nervous energy about him. He kept glancing around, like he was waiting for someone who was never going to show up. Perfect. I approached him slowly, my hands in my pockets, trying to look harmless. Friendly.  

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, giving him a small smile. ‚ÄúYou look like you could use a drink.‚Äù  

He hesitated, his eyes narrowing just a bit. But then he smiled back. ‚ÄúYeah, man. It‚Äôs been a long day.‚Äù  

I nodded, like I understood. Like I cared. ‚ÄúI live just around the corner. I‚Äôve got some beer, if you want.‚Äù  

He looked me over, sizing me up. I could see the doubt in his eyes, but also the loneliness. That‚Äôs what always gets them. The loneliness.  

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù  

We walked back to my apartment together, making small talk. He told me about his job, his ex-girlfriend, how nothing seemed to be going right for him lately. I nodded along, pretending to sympathize. Inside, I was already planning it. The drink. The drugs. The silence.  

When we got to my apartment, I offered him a seat on the couch. ‚ÄúMake yourself comfortable,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll grab the beer.‚Äù  

I went to the kitchen and poured two glasses, making sure to add a little something extra to his. The pills dissolved quickly, just like they always do. I carried the glasses back to the living room and handed him his.  

‚ÄúCheers,‚Äù I said, clinking my glass against his.  

He took a sip, then another. I watched him closely, waiting for the moment when the drugs would take effect. It didn‚Äôt take long. His eyes started to droop, and he set the glass down on the coffee table.  

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel so good,‚Äù he mumbled, leaning back against the couch.  

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said softly. ‚ÄúJust relax.‚Äù  

He tried to say something else, but the words came out slurred. Then his eyes closed, and he was out.  

I sat there for a moment, just watching him. He looked so peaceful, so still. It was almost beautiful. But I knew it wouldn‚Äôt last.  

I stood up and grabbed the rope I‚Äôd hidden under the couch. I tied his hands and feet, making sure the knots were tight. Then I waited.  

When he woke up, he was confused at first. He tried to move, but the ropes held him in place.  

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù he asked, his voice trembling.  

I didn‚Äôt answer. I just watched him, taking in every detail. The fear in his eyes. The way his chest rose and fell with each panicked breath. It was intoxicating.  

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he begged. ‚ÄúLet me go.‚Äù  

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù  

He started to cry then, big, heaving sobs that shook his whole body. I reached out and touched his face, wiping away a tear.  

‚ÄúShhh,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be over soon.‚Äù  

I stood up and went to the kitchen, grabbing the knife I‚Äôd set aside earlier. When I came back, he was still crying, but quieter now. Like he knew there was no point.  

I knelt down beside him and pressed the knife to his throat. He flinched, but didn‚Äôt struggle.  

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said again. ‚ÄúJust relax.‚Äù  

And then I did it.  

The warmth of his blood was the first thing I noticed. It spilled over my hands, hot and sticky, and I couldn‚Äôt help but smile. There‚Äôs nothing else like it‚Äînothing that compares to the feeling of warm blood on your skin. It‚Äôs better than anything I‚Äôve ever felt. Better than the touch of another person, better than the cold, sterile world outside. It‚Äôs alive. It‚Äôs real.  

He screamed then, a high-pitched, almost comical sound that made me laugh. It was so‚Ä¶ unexpected. So human. I nearly got hard from it. The way his voice cracked, the way his body jerked against the ropes‚Äîit was perfect.  

I leaned in closer, watching the life drain out of him. His screams turned to gurgles, then to silence. And then it was over.  

Afterward, I sat there for a long time, just staring at him. His body was still warm, but the life was gone. I felt‚Ä¶ empty. But also satisfied. Like I‚Äôd accomplished something important.  

I got to work then, cleaning up the mess. I wrapped his body in plastic and carried it to the bathroom, where I‚Äôd set up my tools. It was methodical, almost ritualistic. I took my time, making sure everything was just right.  

When I was done, I sat down on the couch and lit a cigarette. The apartment was quiet again, except for the faint hum of the refrigerator. I thought about Jeremiah, about the way he‚Äôd looked at me when he realized what was happening.  

I smiled.  

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mine now,‚Äù I whispered to the empty room.  

And then I turned on the TV, waiting for the news to start.

I'm a classic men's wear enthusiast so I check Session in bloom every year if the premium shoe makers from Marikina visited hoping to get to see their works. Only saw Liam Jacob that makes shoes that almost matches the European styles. Not to say the other shoe brands are bad, they are good and affordable, just that they don't do the classic shape of dress shoes.

ANYWAYS, my friend and I nag-ikot nalang until we got to this relatively big stall situated sa may bungad ng Fr. Carlu street (the road between Porta Vaga and Post Office coming from Bonifacio to Session). May shoe stall dun but what caught our attention was a lady giving out free samples ng flavored vodka.

We tasted of course and got captivated by the amazing taste of their passion fruit flavored vodka. I loved the taste and asked what else flavors they had. They had strawberry, tea (not sure which tea), rose, coffee, cinnamon (which is rum based not vodka). I believe there are more but didn't get to try all of them. All them tasted heavenly that's for sure, I got what was my best 3 flavors only for P500.

They come in small bottles and large bottles. Only got the 3 small bottles for now. The bottles are not your cheaply made ones, they are thick ones sealed in shut with cork caps which gave it a more classy flare for something surprisingly affordable.

The lady said they were all home made which made it extra fantastic for me as a fan of supporting small local businesses and trades, being one myself as a small time leather artisan.

  
Unfortunately, I didn't get to check the stall's name, we left after I confirmed my payment through Gcash went in.

  
So yes, if you guys are looking for some sweet home made flavored spirits, visit their stall sa upper session in between Porta and the post office, you won't miss them, it's the last stall in that area.

I‚Äôd like to share a bit of a story around how I launched my very first iOS app. At the middle of last year, I was obsessed with productivity systems and scrolling productivity subreddits in the hopes that I would finally find something that would fix my life. This is when I stumbled on the concept of habit stacking - the idea of linking new habits to existing ones. I started small: after pouring my morning coffee, I would write the three tasks I needed to get done for the day. After brushing my teeth, I would meditate for five minutes.

I needed a way to keep track of the growing sequential habits but none of the apps I found on the Appstore really captured the way how habits naturally flowed together - so I spent my weekends and hours after work since developing Chayn using SwiftUI. It was a steep learning curve but finally ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù (if there is any such thing) and hitting publish made it all worth it. It‚Äôs now [available to download on the app store.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chayn-stack-habits/id6741157498)

* Ability to stack habits (both in sequence and in parallel)

1iylywx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NileshKasurde/comments/1iylywx/why_satchel_bags_are_the_perfect_fusion_of/,Why Satchel Bags Are the Perfect Fusion of Professionalism and Style,"When it comes to finding the right accessory that blends function and fashion, few items can match the versatility and charm of a satchel bag. Over the years, this iconic fashion piece has evolved from a simple, practical bag to a symbol of sophistication and modern-day style. Whether you are heading to work, a meeting, or a casual outing, the satchel bag is the perfect fusion of professionalism and style, making it an essential addition to any woman's wardrobe.

# The Timeless Appeal of Satchel Bags

Satchel bags have a long history, dating back to the 17th century. Traditionally, they were worn by men and were primarily used for carrying books and other necessities. Fast-forward to today, and the [satchel bag](https://stevemadden.me/collections/womens-satchel-bags) has firmly established itself as a must-have item for women's bags, thanks to its balance of practicality and elegance.

One key reason satchel bags are so popular is their timeless appeal. Their classic design, which features a structured shape, top handles, and a long strap, ensures they can be paired with a wide range of outfits. Their subtle yet sophisticated appearance makes them suitable for professional and casual settings. Whether you are wearing a smart blazer or a casual dress, a satchel bag effortlessly complements your look, offering a polished aesthetic.

# Combining Professionalism with Functionality

In the professional world, the importance of having a practical and stylish bag means winning a lottery. Satchel bags for women offer the perfect solution. They provide ample space to carry all the essentials required for the office or a meeting, such as laptops, notebooks, documents, and even a water bottle or makeup kit. This combination of size and practicality makes the satchel ideal for the modern professional woman.

Unlike other types of bags, satchel bags offer structure and organization. Multiple compartments and inner pockets allow you to keep your belongings [neatly arranged](), making it easier to access everything you need without rummaging through the bag. This sense of organization ensures that a satchel bag remains a functional accessory, even in the busiest environments.

Moreover, satchel bags' adjustable straps allow you to wear the bag comfortably across your body or carry it by the top handles. This flexibility is especially valuable for women on the go who may need to transition between meetings, travel, or social events without changing their bags.

# The Stylish Edge of Satchel Bags

While functionality is essential, style is just as important. Satchel bags for women offer various design options, making it easy to find one that aligns with your taste and lifestyle. The satchel bag is adaptable to any occasion, from sleek leather versions for a more formal, professional look to casual, patterned designs for laid-back weekends.

In addition to their structural shape, many satchel bags feature detailing such as gold or silver hardware, buckles, and straps, further elevating their design. These embellishments add a touch of luxury and refinement, making a satchel bag a statement piece that can enhance any outfit. The versatility of satchel bags allows them to seamlessly transition from a day at the office to an evening out, proving that style does not have to be compromised for practicality.

For women who prefer to make a bolder fashion statement, satchel bags are also available in various vibrant colours, textures, and prints. Whether you choose a bold red leather satchel or a subtle pastel hue, these bags add personality and flair to your wardrobe while maintaining a polished, professional appearance.

# A Bag for Every Occasion

One of the reasons the satchel bag has become a staple in women's fashion is its unique ability to adapt to different environments. It is a reliable companion in the workplace, capable of holding everything needed for a productive day. Whether you are attending meetings, running errands, or giving a presentation, the satchel bag effortlessly supports your professional demands.

Beyond the office, satchel bags transition beautifully into social and casual settings. The satchel provides a balanced, polished look without being too formal when paired with a relaxed outfit like jeans and a blouse. Whether you are meeting friends for coffee or going on a weekend outing, a satchel bag adds a touch of sophistication without appearing out of place.

Additionally, many women now opt for satchel bags for travel. The well-structured design allows for better organization during trips, whether for short weekend getaways or longer vacations. Their comfortable handles and straps also make them easy to carry through airports or while navigating through busy streets, offering both comfort and convenience.

# Satchel Bags and Sustainability

In recent years, sustainability has become an important consideration for many consumers regarding fashion. As a result, satchel [bags for women](https://stevemadden.me/collections/womens-handbags-1) have become increasingly popular in eco-friendly designs. Many satchel bags are now made from sustainable materials, such as organic leather, recycled fabrics, and other eco-conscious options. This shift toward more sustainable products supports environmental efforts and ensures that satchel bags remain a viable and responsible choice for the modern consumer.

By choosing a high-quality, sustainable satchel, women can invest in a piece that will last for years, reducing the need for frequent replacements and promoting a more sustainable approach to fashion.

# The Perfect Fusion of Practicality and Elegance

Satchel bags represent the perfect fusion of professionalism and style. They are designed to meet modern women's needs, offering practicality, comfort, and versatility without sacrificing style. Whether you are using it as a work bag, a travel companion, or a fashionable accessory for casual outings, the satchel bag effortlessly enhances any ensemble.

As the fashion landscape continues to evolve, satchel bags remain a timeless accessory that combines form and function. Whether you prefer a minimalist design or one with intricate details, a satchel bag will never go out of style and will continue to serve as the perfect companion for women everywhere.

In conclusion, satchel bags for women are an essential accessory that can elevate any outfit, be it for professional settings or casual affairs. With their structured design, ample storage, and stylish appeal, these bags offer a perfect blend of practicality and elegance, making them a staple in every modern woman's wardrobe.",1,1740571439.0,u_NileshKasurde,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm not saying I bought the Upseat because I‚Äôm a helicopter mom who googles ‚Äúhip dysplasia‚Äù at 3am, but I‚Äôm also not *not* saying that. Someone had to save my kid from my slouchy DNA after all.

So, here's my thoughts so far.

# First Impressions

So, it‚Äôs gray (like my soul after three months of sleep deprivation) and comes with a tray that looks like it could double as a little UFO. 

Unboxing it was simple. I‚Äôm half-expecting it to come with a manual titled How Not to Screw Up Your Kid's Hips, but it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ there. No assembly, just a lightweight foam blob with a handle. 

I plop my 5-month-old in it (let‚Äôs call her Blobzilla, because she‚Äôs got thighs that could crush a watermelon) and she looks at me like, mom, what fresh hell is this? But then she doesn‚Äôt tip over. She doesn‚Äôt slump into a sad little C-shape or anything. She‚Äôs‚Ä¶ upright? I blink. I sip my coffee. I wonder if I‚Äôve accidentally become a good parent.

The design's got this subtle tilt thing going on. Apparently it‚Äôs all about anterior pelvic tilt, which sounds like a yoga move I'd fail spectacularly. Blobzilla's sitting there, chubby legs splayed out like she‚Äôs claiming her territory, and I‚Äôm thinking, okay, maybe this is better than letting her flop around on the floor. 

I was hoping this thing would be a magic wand, poof, no more holding her up while I try to pee with one hand and fend off the cat with the other. And, honestly? It kinda is. It‚Äôs not just a seat, it's a bit like a containment unit for my tiny tornado.

Did I mention it‚Äôs squishy? Like, I sat on it once (don‚Äôt judge, I‚Äôm 5'4"" and desperate) and it‚Äôs comfier than my couch. Blobzilla seems to agree, she‚Äôs not screaming, which is my new metric for success.

# My Favorite Features

**Ergonomic design.** The slight forward tilt keeps Blobzilla's spine straighter than my posture after a decade of hunching over laptops. It‚Äôs all about engaging her core - like baby Pilates, but without the spandex. 

**Hip-friendly leg room.** the leg holes are wide enough for her thunder thighs, and I‚Äôm obsessed.  this lets her hips chill out in a natural, spread-apart position. Apparently, that‚Äôs gold for avoiding hip dysplasia, something I didn‚Äôt know was a thing until I fell down a parenting forum rabbit hole. It‚Äôs practical and oddly reassuring.

**Removable tray.**  It‚Äôs big (16.5 inches) and clips on like it‚Äôs mocking every flimsy high chair I‚Äôve ever wrestled. I slap some mashed avocado on it, and Blobzilla‚Äôs smearing it like a tiny Picasso while I scarf down my own food. Cleanup‚Äôs easy, just rinse it under the tap and it‚Äôs good as new.

**Portable.** it‚Äôs got a handle and weighs less than my existential dread. I‚Äôve hauled it to playdates, family dinners, everywhere. It straps to any chair with zero drama, turning a rickety dining seat into a baby command center. Last week, I yeeted it into the car trunk for a road trip, and Blobzilla had her own spot at the Airbnb.

**Lifetime warranty.** It's made from medical-grade foam that seems tougher than my willpower around donuts, but this thing also comes with a lifetime warranty apparently. Haven't need to use it but reassuring nonetheless.

**It‚Äôs cute.** okay, it‚Äôs not a feature, but it looks great in my living room. Gray foam, minimalist vibes. It‚Äôs not screaming baby jail. It blends in nicely. Blobzilla sits in it like she‚Äôs judging my decor, and I‚Äôm here for it.

# Pros

* **Posture support.** Blobzilla‚Äôs sitting like she‚Äôs about to deliver a speech. I‚Äôm not saying she‚Äôll thank me at 30 when she‚Äôs not hunched over a desk, but I‚Äôm already smug about it. 

* **Hip health.** those wide leg openings are meant to keep her hips in prime shape, which I'm hopeful about since I‚Äôve got a family history of joint drama. It‚Äôs subtle, but knowing she‚Äôs not cramming her chunky thighs into a torture device gives me peace of mind.

* **Versatility.** floor seat, booster, feeding chair. I‚Äôve used it everywhere.

* **Saves time**. I rinse the tray in five seconds flat, no scrubbing dried peas off like it‚Äôs a crime scene. And dragging it room to room means I‚Äôm not tethered to one spot, which is huge when you‚Äôre juggling a baby and a bunch of household chores. 

* **Confidence boost (mine, not hers).** Knowing it‚Äôs PT-approved makes me feel like I‚Äôm crushing this parenting gig, even when I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs turned me into Supermom, but I‚Äôm less likely to cry into my wine.

# Cons

The price tag made me choke on my lukewarm coffee. I get it, PT cred and fancy foam, but still. And there's always the fact that she'll outgrow this thing eventually. 

# Final Thoughts

If you‚Äôre a paranoid mom (hi, me) who‚Äôs terrified of screwing up your kid‚Äôs spine or hips, this is worth it for the peace of mind. It‚Äôs really great for babies 4 months to 2 years who are wobbly sitters or chunky legends needing leg room. But if you're on a super tight budget it might be harder to justify the cost. 

And if your kid's already a sitting pro or you‚Äôve got a linebacker-sized toddler, it might not last as long as you‚Äôd hope. And if you‚Äôre a minimalist who hates baby gear clutter, this could be one more thing to trip over while muttering about Marie Kondo.

But is it worth it? Yeah, I think so. It‚Äôs not cheap, but it‚Äôs a workhorse, it replaces a high chair, floor seat, and my sanity in one swoop. Blobzilla‚Äôs happier, I‚Äôm less frazzled, and the lifetime warranty means it‚Äôs not a total gamble.

I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited.

My 27F and I 28M (Let's call him Andrew) were together for the guts of a year. We were very compatible, our first date that was supposed to be a coffee and a walk ended up being 8 hours long, we just had that much to talk about. We spent most of our free time last year travelling round the west coast of the island  we live on in his converted van and they are the happiest memories of my life. If we argued, we talked it through until we got to the bottom of the problem and that very rarely happened.  It is probably the healthiest relationship I have ever been in. 

I however, was struggling with a few things which I was very good at masking, from myself and others.

In a previous relationship I almost lost my best friend through not making time for friends and becoming completely absorbed in the relationship. It was a pretty codependent relationship and all the friends I had were his. After we broke up, I created an entirely new life for myself and made a bunch of new friends, all of which were part of the Rugby Club I became a member of. I even ended up living with one of them for a portion of the COVID lockdowns. I also bought a house which is a two minute walk from the two I was closest with. 

For whatever reason, distance began to grow between me and my friends, I am not sure why or when but it was only something I consciously realised once the breakup with Andrew happened. There were subtle signs, like they didn't visit me after my surgery, despite having done so for another friend in the group and also didn't do things like post on social media for my birthday which they historically would have. 

So this was weighing on me and I didn't even realise, it made me make comments that I would have to spend New Years with my friends because I was spending Christmas with Andrew, despite New Year's Eve  being our anniversary. I was so wrapped up in trying to be a good friend, it was making me make decisions that were at the detriment of my relationship.

The only thing that ever was a problem in my relationship with Andrew is that he could not say I love you. We talked at length about it, and he told me he would tell me when he was ready and it's just something that he really struggles with. I understood that it would only happen on his timeline and told him I was happy to wait. And I really meant that. The only part I struggled with was not being able to say it to him because I didn't want that to bring pressure on him. I would however, tell him it a lot when I was drunk. And this is where the main issue I was struggling with comes in. 

I am an Alcoholic. I have no off switch once I start drinking and frequently struggle with drinking too much. I have even gone through periods of drinking a bottle of wine a night. I have on and off dabbled with sobriety and struggled to make it stick (until now). And this is what really led to the break up. 

I was at a rugby christmas event, the day after my work christmas party which meant I was pretty much drinking for 48 hours straight outside of sleeping. I remember throughout the day at the club, talking to various people about how happy I was in my relationship and how I would love to marry him on the cliffs in one of the places we travelled this year. I was gushing about him to anyone would listen. Then I black out. The next memory I have is of me heading to the bathroom and being stopped and kissed by a guy I used to kiss on occasion when single and at these types of events. I caught myself after about 5 seconds and pushed him away, saying to him that he knows about Andrew, to which he replied: ""no one has to know"". 

I know fear is the reason that I let this happen: fear of being in a healthy relationship and a desire to hit self destruct on the one good thing in my life. 

I immediately got myself a taxi home and went to bed. It was late and Andrew was also out drinking, I rang him first thing the next morning and told him that there was something I had to tell him and when he came over, I told him every detail. How it happened and who it was. He took some time but after a few days he decided to break up with me because he was afraid he would resent me for it. I was devastated and pleaded with him, he was not for budging. I told him I would work on myself and come back to him in 6 months to see if he changed his mind. He said ok. 

  
After this, I spiralled a little and really struggled with my drinking and ended up spending both Christmas Day and New Year's Eve completely alone. I also ended up having to ask Andrew to block me on everything because I knew that when drunk I would message and he did. Then I caught myself on. I went sober (with a couple of hiccups along the way) and started to go to therapy. It's been a very difficult few months but I am now doing well. 

I have realised that those friendships no longer serve me, these people who I thought were so important to me, did not check in on me once over the 3 week period from my break up to New Year's. Despite me reaching out to them for help. It was a hard realisation and also meant that I have had to leave the Rugby Club that we are all apart of as being there makes me feel like I am surrounded by ghosts. 

  
So I am focused on healing myself and staying sober and searching for new hobbies that I can fill my free time with. The only thing that still sits with me is Andrew. I still miss him everyday and I really want to reach out to him earlier than I said I would. It's only been about 10 weeks, so my question is: is it too early to reach out to him now? 

  
TLDR; Was in a great relationship, fucked it due to my drinking by kissing someone else, said I would reach out when I worked on myself, he agreed, I've gone sober and am in weekly therapy and doing well, can I reach out now or is better to wait the 6 months I said I would?",1,1740571189.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False
1iylvdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_healthyskinclub/comments/1iylvdd/why_this_coworking_space_in_thane_is_perfect_for/,Why This Co-Working Space in Thane is Perfect for Freelancers & Entrepreneurs?,"https://preview.redd.it/lztttkhf3hle1.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc48c5d95fa8b660677da67be2213ae8323fa30

I never thought a co-working space could change my perspective on work-life balance until I stepped into one in Thane. The idea of a shared workspace wasn‚Äôt foreign to me, but experiencing it firsthand was something else entirely. It was as if I had been stuck in a monotonous routine for years, and suddenly, a fresh wave of inspiration hit me the moment I walked in.

The first thing that struck me was the ambiance. Unlike traditional offices with their rigid cubicles and lifeless walls, this place had character. There was an effortless blend of aesthetics and functionality‚Äîmodern yet warm, professional yet inviting. The lighting was just right, neither too harsh nor too dim, creating the perfect work atmosphere. I noticed small but thoughtful details: potted plants at every corner, artwork that sparked curiosity, and cozy nooks for when you needed a break from the desk.

My journey into this co-working space started out of necessity. As a freelancer, working from home had become a never-ending cycle of distractions‚Äîdoorbells ringing, chores piling up, and the temptation of ‚Äòjust one more episode‚Äô on Netflix. Caf√©s weren‚Äôt much better; they were either too noisy or had unreliable Wi-Fi. So, after much deliberation, I decided to give this co-working space a shot.

Walking in for the first time, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist who instantly made me feel at ease. There was no corporate stiffness, just a welcoming smile and a quick tour of the space. I was pleasantly surprised to see the variety of work zones‚Äîopen desks for those who thrived in an energetic environment, quiet zones for deep focus, and private cabins for confidential meetings. They even had a lounge area where professionals could unwind, chat, or just sip on a cup of coffee without staring at a screen.

Settling in at my chosen spot, I connected my laptop and took a deep breath. For the first time in months, I felt productive without forcing myself. The gentle hum of people working, occasional bursts of laughter from a distant corner, and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee made for the perfect backdrop. It was a world away from the isolation of my home office and the chaos of a caf√©.

What truly made this co-working space special, though, was the people. The community was an eclectic mix‚Äîstartups trying to build the next big thing, remote employees escaping the loneliness of working from home, creative minds brainstorming over whiteboards, and independent professionals like me seeking a structured yet flexible work environment. Conversations sparked effortlessly, whether over a coffee machine or in the middle of a collaborative project. I had expected the space to be just another place to work, but it turned out to be a hub of ideas, networking, and unexpected friendships.

One of the most memorable encounters I had was with a travel blogger who worked from the space twice a week. We got talking over lunch, and within minutes, I found myself immersed in her stories of exploring remote villages and hidden trails. In return, she was curious about my experience in content writing. That single conversation led to a collaboration‚Äîshe needed someone to help with her website content, and I was looking for a project that resonated with my interests. It was a win-win, and it happened organically, something that rarely occurs in traditional office settings.

Then there were the small but impactful initiatives organized by the space‚Äîweekly networking events, knowledge-sharing sessions, and even stress-busting activities like yoga and mindfulness workshops. One evening, I found myself at a session on personal branding led by an entrepreneur who had built a thriving business from scratch. His insights were eye-opening, and by the end of it, I had a notebook full of ideas on how to refine my online presence. The best part? It felt like an engaging discussion rather than a dull seminar.

But it wasn‚Äôt just about work. The space had an unspoken rule‚Äîeveryone was welcome to take a breather. Whether it was playing a quick game of foosball, diving into a book from the shared library, or just enjoying a rooftop sunset, there was always something to help recharge the mind. I remember one evening when a spontaneous music jam session broke out in the lounge area. A group of musicians who worked from the space decided to unwind, and what started as a casual tune soon turned into an impromptu concert. Moments like these made the space feel alive, something a traditional office could never replicate.

However, what really cemented my love for this place was the sheer convenience it offered. High-speed internet, unlimited coffee, ergonomic chairs, well-equipped meeting rooms‚Äîeverything was designed to make work seamless. I no longer had to worry about power cuts disrupting my workflow or struggling to find a quiet spot for client calls. Even simple things like the availability of printing services or a pantry stocked with snacks made a difference. The infrastructure supported my productivity rather than hindering it.

Over time, this co-working space became more than just a workplace; it became my second home. It was the perfect balance between professionalism and comfort, collaboration and solitude, work and play. I found myself looking forward to my workdays instead of dreading them. There was an energy in the air‚Äîan unspoken motivation that pushed me to be better, not just in my career but in my approach to life itself.

Looking back, I realize how much my work routine has transformed. I am more disciplined, more focused, and surprisingly, more social. Working in an environment where everyone is driven and passionate creates an invisible force that pulls you toward your own goals. It‚Äôs contagious in the best way possible.

If you‚Äôve ever found yourself stuck in a rut, uninspired, or simply craving a change in your work environment, I‚Äôd highly recommend giving a co-working space a try. It‚Äôs not just about having a desk or a Wi-Fi connection; it‚Äôs about being part of a dynamic ecosystem that fosters growth, creativity, and human connection. And who knows? You might just walk in looking for a place to work and walk out with a new perspective on life.

Not much, just a small amount sitting there, doing nothing.

I do not know what to do with it. Saving feels useless because, to be honest, what is a few extra dollars going to change? Spending it sounds tempting, but on what? Another coffee? A random online order I will forget about next week?

I want to do something smart with it. Something halal. Something that actually makes sense.

But where do I even start? Stocks, gold, a savings account, or maybe something I have not even thought of?

I completed my Third Way campaign with a One tag (done in 1715) and One Faith achieved in 1730. I pushed missionary strength to 33%, which made my 9 missionnaries convert up to 35-40 provinces per year depending on dev.

Quick story :
Started as Oman. Conquered Yemen area, culture switch and reformed Yemen for better ideas, missions and juicy coffee.

Conquered the Timurids before 1490, placed a timurid on throne and reformed them for free real estate reconquest CB on Persia, missions on Anatolia, Egypt, India, and plunder gouvernment reform

Finished timurid missions tree before forming the mughals. At this point all of Persia, steppes, middle east and northern India were already converted to ibadi.

Picked exploration to discover Australia and moved my capital there. Conquered the new world as soon as I set foot on it, while constantly eating Asia and Africa. Moved my capital to Brazil for the White house state governing cost.

Finished Third Way in 1685 with the conquest and conversion of portuguese Marocco. At this point, I controled the entire world except most of Europe (I had half of Italy, Scotland, the Balkans and Provence) and American East coast (USA broke free from England).

Massive and non-stop wars during 30 years. My 70% admin efficiency, 65% CCR and 55% WS cost on heathens helped me full annex almost everyone in one swoop except France and Poland (2 wars) and core everything within 10 months (thanks to cultural assimilation in mughal diwan).

Almost no rebels with -11 unrest and 24 tolerance of true faith. Even the Revolution spread couldn't push rebels to spawn.

1iyltpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1iyltpl/how_i_killed_jeremiah_jeffery_dahmer_journal/,How I killed Jeremiah. Jeffery Dahmer journal,"I finally met Jeremiah Weinberger.

He was standing at the bus stop, just like I‚Äôd seen him before. Tall, with dark hair and a nervous energy about him. He kept glancing around, like he was waiting for someone who was never going to show up. Perfect. I approached him slowly, my hands in my pockets, trying to look harmless. Friendly.  

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, giving him a small smile. ‚ÄúYou look like you could use a drink.‚Äù  

He hesitated, his eyes narrowing just a bit. But then he smiled back. ‚ÄúYeah, man. It‚Äôs been a long day.‚Äù  

I nodded, like I understood. Like I cared. ‚ÄúI live just around the corner. I‚Äôve got some beer, if you want.‚Äù  

He looked me over, sizing me up. I could see the doubt in his eyes, but also the loneliness. That‚Äôs what always gets them. The loneliness.  

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù  

We walked back to my apartment together, making small talk. He told me about his job, his ex-girlfriend, how nothing seemed to be going right for him lately. I nodded along, pretending to sympathize. Inside, I was already planning it. The drink. The drugs. The silence.  

When we got to my apartment, I offered him a seat on the couch. ‚ÄúMake yourself comfortable,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll grab the beer.‚Äù  

I went to the kitchen and poured two glasses, making sure to add a little something extra to his. The pills dissolved quickly, just like they always do. I carried the glasses back to the living room and handed him his.  

‚ÄúCheers,‚Äù I said, clinking my glass against his.  

He took a sip, then another. I watched him closely, waiting for the moment when the drugs would take effect. It didn‚Äôt take long. His eyes started to droop, and he set the glass down on the coffee table.  

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel so good,‚Äù he mumbled, leaning back against the couch.  

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said softly. ‚ÄúJust relax.‚Äù  

He tried to say something else, but the words came out slurred. Then his eyes closed, and he was out.  

I sat there for a moment, just watching him. He looked so peaceful, so still. It was almost beautiful. But I knew it wouldn‚Äôt last.  

I stood up and grabbed the rope I‚Äôd hidden under the couch. I tied his hands and feet, making sure the knots were tight. Then I waited.  

When he woke up, he was confused at first. He tried to move, but the ropes held him in place.  

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù he asked, his voice trembling.  

I didn‚Äôt answer. I just watched him, taking in every detail. The fear in his eyes. The way his chest rose and fell with each panicked breath. It was intoxicating.  

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he begged. ‚ÄúLet me go.‚Äù  

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù  

He started to cry then, big, heaving sobs that shook his whole body. I reached out and touched his face, wiping away a tear.  

‚ÄúShhh,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be over soon.‚Äù  

I stood up and went to the kitchen, grabbing the knife I‚Äôd set aside earlier. When I came back, he was still crying, but quieter now. Like he knew there was no point.  

I knelt down beside him and pressed the knife to his throat. He flinched, but didn‚Äôt struggle.  

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said again. ‚ÄúJust relax.‚Äù  

And then I did it.  

The warmth of his blood was the first thing I noticed. It spilled over my hands, hot and sticky, and I couldn‚Äôt help but smile. There‚Äôs nothing else like it‚Äînothing that compares to the feeling of warm blood on your skin. It‚Äôs better than anything I‚Äôve ever felt. Better than the touch of another person, better than the cold, sterile world outside. It‚Äôs alive. It‚Äôs real.  

He screamed then, a high-pitched, almost comical sound that made me laugh. It was so‚Ä¶ unexpected. So human. I nearly got hard from it. The way his voice cracked, the way his body jerked against the ropes‚Äîit was perfect.  

I leaned in closer, watching the life drain out of him. His screams turned to gurgles, then to silence. And then it was over.  

Afterward, I sat there for a long time, just staring at him. His body was still warm, but the life was gone. I felt‚Ä¶ empty. But also satisfied. Like I‚Äôd accomplished something important.  

I got to work then, cleaning up the mess. I wrapped his body in plastic and carried it to the bathroom, where I‚Äôd set up my tools. It was methodical, almost ritualistic. I took my time, making sure everything was just right.  

When I was done, I sat down on the couch and lit a cigarette. The apartment was quiet again, except for the faint hum of the refrigerator. I thought about Jeremiah, about the way he‚Äôd looked at me when he realized what was happening.  

I smiled.  

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mine now,‚Äù I whispered to the empty room.  

And then I turned on the TV, waiting for the news to start.

One day I was plugging along turning coffee into code when all Hell broke loose. Our marketing team decided to launch a ""personalized"" email campaign without consulting IT first, or even consulting anyone, really.

Out of nowhere, suddenly our servers started screaming at a pitch I don't ever want to hear again in my life. CPU usage spiked to 100%, and queries slowed down to zero. My first though was that we were being hit by a DDOS attack. What I found was far more facepalm-worthy.

The marketing team had written a query to send personalized emails to our entire customer base ‚Äì all almost 5 million of them. Their query pulled data from nearly every table in our database, joining them in the most inefficient way possible. The icing of the cake was that they had set it to run every 5 minutes. It was later described by my senior to the bosses as like watching someone try to empty the ocean with a teaspoon, only to refill it with a fire hose every few seconds.

After some frantic calls and a lot of explaining (with technical terms I'm sure they didn't bother even trying to undersatnd), we managed to get them to pause the campaign. It took three days of optimization, index creation, and query rewriting to get their personalization working without bringing our entire infrastructure to a standstill. 

The silver lining? Management finally approved our long-standing and often-denied request for a separate analytics database. Sometimes, it takes a near-catastrophe to get the resources you need",40,1740570176.0,talesfromtechsupport,2,0.95,False

The economy is interconnected, what happens at the Federal level affects the rest of the system. These Republican f*ckers are going to destroy this country and make life here even more miserable and destitute.

Picture this: the American economy tanks, federal programs‚ÄîSocial Security, Medicare, food stamps‚Äîvanish overnight. (An ambition of the GOP). Life as you know it? Flipped upside down. No gradual decline, just a hard drop into a raw, scrappy reality. Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôd wake up to, day after brutal day, and the gut-punch struggles that‚Äôd define it.

Your paycheck or safety net? Gone. Retirees counting on pensions, the disabled leaning on aid, the jobless hoping for a lifeline‚Äîwiped out. Millions can‚Äôt buy meds, pay rent, or fill a grocery cart. Businesses collapse like dominoes‚Äîyour corner coffee shop, the hardware store, dead. Unemployment explodes as government gigs evaporate and consumer cash dries up. You‚Äôre not just broke; you‚Äôre scrambling.

Food turns into a hunt. Supply chains stutter‚Äîcity shelves empty, rural folks barter with whatever‚Äôs growing. Water‚Äôs next: utilities flicker, then fail, leaving you hauling buckets or praying for rain. Power cuts hit, and suddenly you‚Äôre cold, in the dark, jury-rigging heat with whatever burns. Housing? A free-for-all. Evictions pile up, banks grab homes no one can buy, and families cram together or squat in ghost towns of foreclosures. Tent cities sprout like weeds.

Crime‚Äôs your new neighbor. Cops, underfunded, fade; looters and thieves step up. Healthcare? A pipe dream. No insurance, no cash, no care‚Äîhospitals bolt their doors. You ration pills, skip the doctor, and watch treatable stuff turn deadly. Mental cracks widen‚Äîstress, fear, no Prozac to soften it. Kids ditch school for survival gigs; classrooms empty as teachers bail.

Society frays but fights. Some band together‚Äîswap skills, grow veggies, guard their own. Others turn hard, eyeing strangers like threats. Riots flare, then fizzle‚Äîhunger saps the spark. Transportation‚Äôs a relic‚Äîgas spikes or runs dry, stranding you on foot. Phones die when bills go unpaid, cutting you off from the world.

The big struggles? Starving, freezing, crumbling health. Jobs become scraps‚Äîscavenging, hustling, anything. You‚Äôre isolated, pissed, and scared, with no cavalry coming. Think Great Depression 2.0, but nastier: less grit, more tech we can‚Äôt lean on. The clever adapt‚Äîbarter, improvise, cling to community. The rest? They sink. It‚Äôs not Mad Max; it‚Äôs a slow, smart, savage grind where the strong rewrite the rules and the weak just hope.",100,1740570118.0,economicCollapse,41,0.94,False

OK, I need to just lay it all on the line here. 

I'm a 37 f... And I have absolutely dated women before.

However... I .. Don't know how to date another bi person. 

Ive had a massive crush on this girl I've known for 15 years-ish. 

A few months ago she had a drunken moment where she told me she questioned her secuality and realized she was bi because of me. I admitted to her that I also felt that way back in the day but also that I was worried she was drunk and maybe it was best to talk while sober. 

FAST FORWARD - I'm single now. (also immediately tried to make plans with her and not in a skeezy way, just cause I missed her as an old friend) 

OK. Guys just stay with me.

So she asked me to go to coffee or dinner the other day. We had the most mentally stimulating convo I've had in YEARS. Shes incredible. So smart. Fun, funny, kind, soulful. Like all of this and also beautiful. And beautiful isn't even the best part. 

So I'm getting all the green flags. She gave me something I had to give back and said ""now I'll have to see you in a week"" 

She's flirty (but again I THINK) cause I'm not used to dating bi girls and i am used to definitive green flags... 

So I don't know what to do!! 

HOW DO U ALL DEAL WITH THE BI PANIC?? 

I'm not the man one (thank you Emma Willmann) and neither is she, so I'm worried that I don't know how to make the first move cause I'm just a stupid lost bi girl trying to make her way in the world. üòÇüôà

Black Phantom by Kilian is the olfactory embodiment of indulgence and self-obsession. Liquid Narcissism. 


The first spray hits with a rush of rum and creamy almonds-intense, almost poisonous. Hostile This is the moment you understand that this scent isn't for the weak-kneed; it's for someone who takes sadistic pleasure in making others' knees buckle. 


As the scent settles, it radiates warmth as a rich chocolate note melds with the scent of roasted coffee-sweet, almost as if to keep up appearances. But the rum and almonds linger, a quiet warning beneath the charm.


This scent doesn't evolve like most compositions I'm used to; it remains constant from start to finish. Yet, every whiff is just as intoxicating as the last. You can't help but savor it, finding beauty in its unwavering presence. And as you look around, you can't help but feel just a little superior to everyone else in the room. The beautiful and the damned.

And it's such an unfair situation to go through in a time thats already life changing and sad. And how do you move forward after losing your best friend/partner, trust, confidence, dignity, and also suddenly becoming impotent. Its like everything has been stripped of me.**  
  
Me (33M) and my partner (30F) of 5 years had a really messy breakup. She claims she was truely in love with me and proposed to me after 2 years. But we never got married because when I had the money she never bought the ring. I wasnt allowed to because she didnt like people buying her jewellery cos she had to pick it. But in the 5 years together we never once spontaniously kissed and it was only during intimacy. I brought it up a few times only to be yelled at for pressuring her. But she ended up kissing another guy after lying about guys and girls hanging out and it doiesnt mean anything (which I was fine with). But thats a pretty deep cut thats left me feeling defective and alienated. I had a breakdown and threw her stuff out the front and kicked her out, but she could take it all so I put most back inside. THe next day I helped her with a moving truck to take things and we spoke and hung out for hours and became civil and were going to be friends and she said she wasnt sure if she wanted to date in the future after that episode. The next morning I messaged her saying ill get another mug so we can have a coffee together and we were still totally amicable. When she was over I told her that I wasnt going to grovel at her feet anymore and that she had messed up too and that if she wanted us to have a future she would hae to prove it too me. This set her of and she started argueing and following me around saying i was gaslighting her. Then she pulled out her phone to record and i grabed it and then let go. She calmly walked to the kitchen and then shortly after went out to her car. I went out to see what she was doing and she was standing tall with a hatred in her eyes. She wasnt scared and thats certain. She drove off and I spent the whole day packing her things and putting them in the loungeroom. But later that night I got a call from the police and went in for a questioning which turned out to be being arrested and then I couldnt go home till after court. She said I pined her up against a wall, which was totally untrue. But I cant contact her and I have no idea where this came from. The police say shes scared, but I dont think thatrs the case at all. It really seems like a power play. The way she llooks at me the last few weeks is cold as ice. I dont know if its mental problems or maybe drugs. But there's something different. I dont know if it was just to keep us apart to make it easier for her, or maybe she genuinely is scared. I really dont think she is cos she knows me better than anyone. But Ive joined a mens behavioural course just in case, I'm not always right about everything.  But this whole thing sucks, and I just cant comprehend why it went the way it did.

Dandy blend (dandelion, chicory & barley tea! ) with collagen based protein powder (vital proteins or thrive market bovine collagen) plus some form of cream/milk (I use sugar free sweet cream coffee mate) and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg on the top. Sweetener of choice if that‚Äôs your preference (she does honey or maple syrup, I go the sugar free route and sometimes go for Splenda). I had originally been reading that dandelion tea is amazing for digestion and that chicory is a good source of prebiotic fiber, and of course bestie already had it and was willing to make me some from her own stash.

This has also helped me hold on to some semblance of normalcy as I go through my 2 week post-op liquid stage. Having a hot rich beverage in the morning has always been a ritual of mine and I‚Äôm not a fan of lighter bodied teas, and broth is what I like for snacks/dinner time through this stage.

# First Impressions

The box is sleek, black, and screams I'm expensive, treat me nice, which already makes me feel underdressed in my coffee-stained sweats. Inside, it‚Äôs a treasure trove: the dryer itself, two auto-wrap curlers, a paddle brush, an oval brush, a diffuser, and a styling concentrator. Six tools! I‚Äôve got fewer friends than that, and they‚Äôre less useful.

The thing itself is a looker - black with rose gold accents, like it‚Äôs ready for a night out.  It‚Äôs compact, just over 1.5 pounds, which is a relief because my old dryer felt like hefting a kettlebell. The twisty gimmick, where it flips from a straight wand to an L-shaped dryer, had me giggling like a kid, fully aware I‚Äôm alone and unhinged.

Plugging it in, I‚Äôm hit with a wave of hope and dread. Hope, because I‚Äôve seen TikTok swear this thing‚Äôs a Dyson Airwrap killer at half the price. Dread, because my history with hair tools is a tragic.

I start with the concentrator, aiming it at my sopping wet mop, and it dries quick -like, half my usual time quick. My fine, wavy hair‚Äôs usually a frizzy disaster post-shower, but this thing‚Äôs smoothing it out nicely.

At the moment, I‚Äôm picturing it slotting into my life like the cool aunt who shows up with wine and fixes everything. 

# My Favorite Features

**Twist-and-flex feature.** One twist, and it‚Äôs a classic L-shaped dryer. another, it‚Äôs a styling wand. I‚Äôm drying roots one sec, curling tips the next, all without juggling tools. It‚Äôs seamless for my chaotic mornings... like, I can sip coffee and not drop a straightener on my foot.

**Auto-wrap curlers with coanda tech.** These 1.25-inch barrels use airflow to wrap your hair around them, no clamping required. my first go was a mess, but once I got it (pro tip: small sections, patience), I had curls that lasted through a Zoom call and a grocery run. My hair usually laughs at curls, but these stuck.

**Oval brush for volume.** attach this, and it‚Äôs a blowout in a snap. the combo of bristles and airflow smooths my frizz while pumping up volume. think ""I woke up like this"" but less lie-y.

**No-heat-damage.** Shark says it checks temps 1,000 times a second to keep heat low and consistent. my ends used to feel like straw after styling, but this? they‚Äôre soft, shiny, almost alive. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a miracle, but it seems to work.

**Fast-drying.** It‚Äôs light but punches hard. my shoulder-length hair‚Äôs dry in under 10 minutes, half my old time. It‚Äôs not just speed, it‚Äôs smooth speed. no frizz, no fuss, just oh, I guess I‚Äôm ready now.

# Pros

* **Time saving.** 15 minutes, boom, done. it‚Äôs like Shark distilled my routine into one simple package. I‚Äôve got extra time to scroll Instagram now (priorities.)

* **curls that don‚Äôt quit.** The auto-wrap curlers seem to give me bounce that lasts days. 

* **healthier hair vibes.** that no-heat-damage thing seems legit. my ends aren‚Äôt crispy, my scalp isn‚Äôt screaming, and my hair‚Äôs shinier than it‚Äôs been since I quit bleaching it. it‚Äôs not a spa treatment, but I‚Äôm less scared to style daily now, which is wild.

* **one tool.** this replaces my dryer, curler, straightener, and that diffuser I swore I‚Äôd use someday. plus, it‚Äôs pretty. black and rose gold? I‚Äôd date it if it weren‚Äôt an object.

# Cons

* **It‚Äôs loud.** Like, my cat bolts when I turn it on, and I don‚Äôt blame him.

* **hair snags.** It you‚Äôre clumsy like me, sometimes hair snags where attachments click in, ouch. Be careful. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but I‚Äôve cursed it out a few times.

# Final Thoughts

If you‚Äôre like me - busy, mildly inept with hair, and tired of juggling tools - this is something you'll probably love. But if you‚Äôre a minimalist who just rough-dries and runs, skip it - this is overkill.

But for me, I'm sold. My hair‚Äôs happier, my mornings are saner, and I‚Äôm getting compliments from friends - unheard of. It‚Äôs not flawless - noise and weight bug me sometimes - but the pros outweigh the cons by a mile.

Coffee is more than just a delicious and energizing beverage. It is packed with powerful antioxidants, essential nutrients, and bioactive compounds that can positively impact your overall health. But can coffee actually make you healthier? Science says yes! In this article, we‚Äôll explore 10 science-backed benefits of coffee that can improve your well-being and help you lead a healthier life.

# 1. Coffee is Rich in Antioxidants

Coffee is one of the richest sources of antioxidants in the modern diet. Antioxidants help protect your body from oxidative stress, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Studies show that coffee contains polyphenols, hydrocinnamic acids, and chlorogenic acid, which help fight inflammation and free radical damage.

# 2. Coffee Can Boost Brain Function

Caffeine, the main active ingredient in coffee, is a natural stimulant that enhances brain function. It blocks the neurotransmitter adenosine, leading to increased alertness, improved memory, and better cognitive performance. Several studies suggest that regular coffee consumption may reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

# 3. Coffee May Support Heart Health

Moderate coffee consumption has been linked to a lower risk of heart disease. Research suggests that coffee can improve blood vessel function, reduce inflammation, and lower the risk of stroke. Some studies indicate that drinking 2‚Äì4 cups of coffee per day may lower the risk of heart failure and coronary artery disease.

# 4. Coffee Helps Boost Metabolism and Fat Burning

1iylecu,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1iylecu/anxiety_attack/,anxiety attack,"Hi. First time ko magkaroon ng anxiety attack kanina. Actually di ko rin sure kung anxiety attack nga yon. Pero nung una hindi ko alam what‚Äôs happening. Pumasok ako sa work okay pa naman. Barely 5 hours of sleep pero keri na. 

Buong umaga hanggang tanghali, feel ko masusuka ako, nanginginig, feverish, mabilis ang tibok ng puso (pero hindi malakas, napi-feel ko lang na sobrang bilis) and feverish. Kumain naman ako ng breakfast. And nag coffee din ako. So naisip ko, ah baka kasi nasa office na naman ako (hindi ko alam bakit pero tuwing masama pakiramdam ko, lumalala palagi sa office) 

So pinabayaan ko na lang. Nag work lang ako. Nag try matulog nung lunch break kaso feel ko masusuka ako pag humiga ako so umupo na lang ako at naglaro ng idle games sa phone. Natapos na yung lunch break (10:30am - 11am), hindi naman gumaan loob ko. So balik na lang ako work. 

Bandang tanghali, hindi naman ako nagutom pero nag lunch na lang ako sa desk ko kasi sayang baon. So kumain ako habang nagwe-work and for a while gumaan pakiramdam ko. Maya maya bumalik na naman yung same feelings kanina less intense so ignore na lang. Inisip ko onting tiis na lang uwian na. 

Mga 45 minutes before uwian. Nagta trabaho lang ako and bigla ako naiiyak out of nowhere. Like uncontrollably crying (thank god wala yung mga katabi ko and umuwi na yung nasa likod ko) so wala naman ata naka pansin pero shet hindi ko mapigilan luha ko. Mga 10-15 minutes din ata yon before natigil and nag try ako kalmahin sarili ko. Tapos nag cr ako para mag hilamos. Nag ayos na ko ng gamit mga 10 minutes before uwian para uuwi nang honda. Kasi natatakot ako na baka maiyak na naman out of nowhere. 

So ayon nakaalis na ko ng lobby pero nakasalubong ko yung colleague ko na medyo close ko pero di ko siya pinansin kasi feel ko if mahalata niyang umiyak ako earlier e di ko na mako control yung emotions ko. So dumiretso ako cr at di ko siya pinansin. Nag abang lang ako ilang seconds tapos lumabas na ko at nag antay ng elevator pababa wishing na wala ako makasabay sa mga ka work ko. 

Pauwi na ko. Naglalakad papuntang sakayan pero out of nowhere na naman naiyak na naman ako. Tuloy tuloy. Hanggang makaabot ako ng mall. Hindi ko na talaga kinaya. Like kahit anong try ko i-kalma sarili ko di ko mapigilan. So pumunta ako sa cr ng mall and and nagtago sa stall. Nag chat ako sa bestfriend kong may anxiety and humingi ng tulong. Tbh nung nakausap ko pa lang siya laking tulong na. Medyo kumalma ako and kinamusta niya ko and sinabi niya sakin mga dapat ko gawin. Nag book an ko angkas pauwi para mapadali byahe and thankfully nakauwi naman kahit umiiyak iyak pa rin ng slight sa byahe haha 

Ginawa ko yung sinabi ni bestie and in fairness effective naman. Unti unti kumalma emotions ko and nawala na rin yung ibang mga nararamdaman. 

Ngayon kalmado na ko pero kanina ko pa tina try makatulog dahil gusto ko pa sana pumasok bukas (sayang sahod/SL) pero mukhang impossible. 

Sana pagsulat ko neto ay tuluyang gumaan loob ko at makatulog na nang mahimbing. 

Ayon lang. Gusto ko lang i-share kasi parang ayoko na mag share sa friends ko kasi feel ko sobrang heavy na and di ko rin talaga naiintindihan tong nararamdaman ko.

We‚Äôve always had a bit of a dynamic where I‚Äôve been the one working hard and earning the big money. My wife had a government job, but to be honest, I‚Äôve always felt like it wasn‚Äôt real work. She was doing a ""dream job,"" working in nature, but it wasn‚Äôt demanding, and honestly, it felt like she was just coasting by while I was the one putting in the long hours and making the real money.

Now, my wife has been made redundant from her job, and I‚Äôve told her that while she‚Äôs looking for something else, she needs to stop frivolous spending. We‚Äôve always been financially comfortable, but since she‚Äôs not bringing in any income right now, I think it makes sense for her to be more responsible with my money until she finds a new job. 

I‚Äôve always been the one who works harder. I work longer hours, I‚Äôve pushed myself, and I‚Äôve made sacrifices in my career to get to the position I‚Äôm in. Meanwhile, she had this cushy job that, let‚Äôs be honest, barely demanded much from her. She wasn‚Äôt working hard, she was just doing something that was easy for her. I‚Äôve tried to explain this to her, that I‚Äôve always been the one pulling the weight financially, and now that she‚Äôs out of work, it‚Äôs time for her to step up in other ways. I think she should be making sure the house is in order and focusing on providing a comfortable home environment for both of us. She wants to sit in coffee shops  spending my money on ridiculously overpriced Starbucks whilst ""job hunting"". Frankly I don't think she has the experience or work ethic for a real job and she would do better as a stay at home wife looking after our home. I don't mind if she spends some money keeping herself looking nice but it's getting ridiculous. I came home from work late the other night and instead of having a nice meal prepared for both of us I found her sitting in her pyjamas watching TV and drinking wine. When I confronted her she said she'd just finished spending all day applying for jobs, but when I asked her to show me what jobs she applied for she started this argument. 

She‚Äôs says I‚Äôm being unsupportive. But honestly, I feel like I‚Äôve done enough to support her for years, and now it's her turn to give something back.

So, AITA for telling her to stop frivolous spending and start doing more around the house whilst she's unemployed? Or am I being too harsh?

Edit: I love and respect my wife but she acts like money is not something we have to worry about and that's because she's not the one working for it. Her parents put her through a doctorate, I paid the deposit on our home. Instead of using her education to start a high stress high paying career, like I did, she instead went for a  job she loves. We couldn't both do that so I supported her decision because at least she was bringing in something. But now she isn't and acts like it's no big deal because she knows one way or another, I'll keep the money coming in. 

And she likes to keep herself looking nice and I have no problem with that. I don't expect her to look nice for me.",0,1740569268.0,AmItheAsshole,53,0.22,False

I have worked as a chef in a commercial kitchen (food to order from websites). It became extremely overwhelming due to workload per person in the past few weeks and I literally started panicking et . whenever an evening came and I knew I have to go there the next morning.

I honestly fel like a miserable s*it working there recently and the ignorant and very sarcastic new management wasn't helping my mental health either.

Anyway, I gave my resignation letter last Friday. The notice period is 4 weeks. 
I have been out sick due to work related stress for slightly over a week now.

I started applying to coffee shops instead. 

I know personally that this environment was and will be FAR less stressful for me; I've worked in coffee shops for quite a few years in the past and ended up in this current place simply due to being desperate while job hunting.
I have just received an offer for an assistant manager position, but I would be starting from Monday or Tuesday at the latest next week.

The coffee shop in question is a small, private shop which isn't getting very busy etc. as I have been going there personally for quite some time to grab a coffee.

Could anyone possibly help me in this situation? What are my options? I have already mentioned in the resignation letter that I give it due to ""personal problems"" and that I will provide a doctor's note for the notice period.
I'm supposed to have a GP call appointment due to work stress/anxiety sometime today.

Was undiagnosed for 40 years. Then diagnosed with inattentive type in 2024. I smoked cigarettes from 15-25. Caffeine from 17 to 40. Started on ritalin a year ago. 

Initially taking it was a revelation but it didn't really work as dose was too low and I was still drinking coffee which made me jittery and anxious, so stopped the caffeine completely (was a 4 coffee per day person!). I've been caffeine free for 6 months and on 30mg of ritalin however I'm toying with coming off as I don't feel like myself.

I like the buzz from ritalin, I can concentrate on tasks for extended periods and feel good but I feel something is missing and I now reach for it at the weekends (helps when I've got two young, loud kids!), whereas previously I'd have a break at the weekend. I think I'm a bit anxious on it and I feel I'm really reliant on it. 

I have had a history of anxiety etc but I didn't know anything about ADHD until I was diagnosed just over a year ago. A lot of anxiety comes from failure in the past and having difficulties but ADHD diagnosis has helped put that in context.

ASML Holding N.V. √® una delle aziende pi√π vitali ma meno conosciute al di fuori del mondo degli investitori. Fondata nel 1984 a Veldhoven, nei Paesi Bassi, ASML √® diventata una forza indispensabile nell'industria dei semiconduttori, svolgendo un ruolo fondamentale nel plasmare il futuro della tecnologia digitale.

Al centro dell'importanza di ASML si trova la litografia‚Äîun processo essenziale per la produzione di microchip. Pensatela come una tecnica di stampa ultra-precisa, dove complessi schemi di circuiti vengono proiettati su wafer di silicio. Questi circuiti sono cos√¨ minuscoli che vengono misurati in nanometri‚Äîdecine di migliaia di volte pi√π piccoli della larghezza di un capello umano. Le macchine litografiche di ASML utilizzano tecnologia avanzata basata sulla luce per incidere questi schemi con una precisione sorprendente.

Ci√≤ che veramente distingue ASML √® la sua padronanza della litografia a ultravioletti estremi (EUV), una tecnologia rivoluzionaria che ha richiesto decenni e miliardi di euro per essere sviluppata. L'EUV permette la produzione di chip semiconduttori con caratteristiche piccole fino a 3 nanometri, una scala che una volta si pensava impossibile. Per mettere questo in prospettiva, √® come disegnare un cerchio perfetto 14.000 volte pi√π piccolo di un capello umano.

Replicare il successo di ASML √® praticamente impossibile. Ogni macchina EUV √® un prodigio ingegneristico, composto da oltre 100.000 componenti di precisione, che richiede 40 container per il trasporto e necessita di quattro Boeing 747 solo per essere consegnata. Le macchine sono assemblate attraverso una vasta rete di pi√π di 700 fornitori specializzati, un ecosistema finemente calibrato che ha richiesto decenni per essere costruito.

Con la sua competenza senza rivali, ASML detiene effettivamente le chiavi del futuro della produzione di semiconduttori, rendendola una delle aziende pi√π critiche ma sottovalutate nel panorama tecnologico globale.

# Company Overview: Who is ASML and What Do They Do?

ASML Holding N.V. is one of the most vital yet least-known companies outside the world of investors. Founded in 1984 in Veldhoven, Netherlands, ASML has become an indispensable force in the semiconductor industry, playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital technology.

At the heart of ASML‚Äôs significance lies lithography‚Äîa process essential for manufacturing microchips. Think of it as an ultra-precise printing technique, where complex circuit patterns are projected onto silicon wafers. These circuits are so minuscule that they‚Äôre measured in nanometers‚Äîtens of thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. ASML‚Äôs lithography machines use advanced light-based technology to etch these patterns with astonishing accuracy.

What truly sets ASML apart is its mastery of¬†**Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography**, a breakthrough technology that took decades and billions of euros to develop. EUV enables the production of semiconductor chips with features as small as¬†**3 nanometers**, a scale that was once thought impossible. To put that into perspective, it‚Äôs akin to drawing a flawless circle¬†**14,000 times smaller than a human hair**.

Replicating ASML‚Äôs success is virtually impossible. Each EUV machine is an engineering marvel, consisting of over¬†**100,000 precision-engineered components**, requiring¬†**40 shipping containers**¬†for transport, and needing¬†**four Boeing 747s**¬†just to be delivered. The machines are assembled through a vast network of¬†**more than 700 specialized suppliers**, a finely tuned ecosystem that took decades to build.

With its unrivaled expertise, ASML effectively holds the keys to the future of semiconductor manufacturing, making it one of the most critical yet underappreciated companies in the global technology landscape.

# Company Overview: Who is ASML and What Do They Do?

ASML Holding N.V. is one of the most vital yet least-known companies outside the world of investors. Founded in 1984 in Veldhoven, Netherlands, ASML has become an indispensable force in the semiconductor industry, playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital technology.

At the heart of ASML‚Äôs significance lies lithography‚Äîa process essential for manufacturing microchips. Think of it as an ultra-precise printing technique, where complex circuit patterns are projected onto silicon wafers. These circuits are so minuscule that they‚Äôre measured in nanometers‚Äîtens of thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. ASML‚Äôs lithography machines use advanced light-based technology to etch these patterns with astonishing accuracy.

What truly sets ASML apart is its mastery of¬†**Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography**, a breakthrough technology that took decades and billions of euros to develop. EUV enables the production of semiconductor chips with features as small as¬†**3 nanometers**, a scale that was once thought impossible. To put that into perspective, it‚Äôs akin to drawing a flawless circle¬†**14,000 times smaller than a human hair**.

Replicating ASML‚Äôs success is virtually impossible. Each EUV machine is an engineering marvel, consisting of over¬†**100,000 precision-engineered components**, requiring¬†**40 shipping containers**¬†for transport, and needing¬†**four Boeing 747s**¬†just to be delivered. The machines are assembled through a vast network of¬†**more than 700 specialized suppliers**, a finely tuned ecosystem that took decades to build.

With its unrivaled expertise, ASML effectively holds the keys to the future of semiconductor manufacturing, making it one of the most critical yet underappreciated companies in the global technology landscape.

* Feature a window or porthole offering a view of the ocean.
* Allow natural light, making the room feel more spacious.
* Great for travelers who want a balance between affordability and a view.

* Provide a private outdoor space to enjoy the ocean breeze.
* Ideal for those who enjoy spending time in their room while still experiencing the outdoors.
* Prices can be significantly higher, but the experience is worth it for many.
* Perfect for watching sunsets, sipping coffee in the morning, and feeling the sea air.
* Average square footage: 200 to 300 square feet.
* Keep in mind that balconies can sometimes be shaded by decks above or obstructed by lifeboats.

**Suites: Luxurious Indulgence üè®**

* The most luxurious and spacious option on the ship.
* Often include exclusive perks like concierge services, priority boarding, and access to private lounges.
* Best for travelers who want extra comfort and VIP treatment.
* Some suites feature extra rooms, hot tubs, or extended balconies.

# Choosing the Best Stateroom Location on a Cruise Ship üõ≥Ô∏è

The location of your cabin plays a huge role in your cruise experience. Here‚Äôs how to determine where on a cruise ship is best for your needs:

**Midship Cabins: The Safest Bet for Motion Sickness ü§¢**

* Located near the center of the ship, minimizing movement from waves.
* Ideal for first-time cruisers or those prone to seasickness.
* Usually more expensive due to their stability and popularity.
* Less noise from the front or back of the ship.

**Higher Decks: Great for Views and Convenience üåÖ**

* Closer to pools, buffets, and entertainment areas.
* Provide better panoramic views but can experience more motion.
* Ideal for those who love quick access to fun activities but may be noisy.
* Cabins directly under the lido deck buffet can be noisy during early breakfast hours.

**Lower Decks: Budget-Friendly and Stable ‚öì**

* Less motion compared to higher decks, making them great for stability.
* Often quieter due to being farther from high-traffic areas.
* Typically offer more affordable pricing while still providing comfort.

**Aft Cabins (towards the stern): Best for Scenic Views üåÑ**

* Located at the back of the ship with panoramic ocean views.
* Often favored for long, peaceful views of the wake.
* Some ships have extended balconies at the aft, making them a luxurious choice.
* Potential for engine vibrations or noise, so check reviews before booking.

**Forward Cabins: Good for Adventure Seekers üé¢**

* Located at the front of the ship.
* Best for those who enjoy feeling the ship‚Äôs movement and aren‚Äôt prone to seasickness.
* Can offer fantastic views but may be windier when on the balcony.

# Where Is the Best Room on a Cruise Ship? üéØ

The best room depends on your personal preferences. Here‚Äôs a quick guide based on different traveler needs:

* **For light sleepers:** Choose midship, away from elevators and nightclubs.
* **For luxury travelers:** Opt for a suite with exclusive amenities.
* **For budget-conscious travelers:** Interior cabins on lower decks provide the best value.
* **For motion-sensitive cruisers:** Stay on a lower deck, midship.
* **For families:** Connecting rooms or larger cabins with extra space are ideal.
* **For those needing accessible cabins:** Research specific cruise lines and ships, as offerings vary widely.
* **Guaranteed Cabins:** For those who are not picky, and want to save some money, look into guaranteed cabin options.¬†

# Best Place to Sleep on a Cruise Ship üò¥

If a good night‚Äôs sleep is your priority, avoid rooms near high-traffic areas. Cabins located under nightclubs, theaters, or pool decks tend to be noisier. Midship and lower deck cabins tend to be the quietest, making them the **quietest cruise cabin location**.¬†

# Avoiding Common Cruise Cabin Mistakes üö´

To ensure you choose the **best place to be on a cruise ship**, avoid these common pitfalls:

* **Booking near noisy areas:** Avoid cabins close to stairwells, elevators, or major venues.
* **Ignoring the deck plan:** Check what‚Äôs directly above and below your room to avoid potential noise.
* **Choosing the wrong view:** Some oceanview cabins have obstructed views due to lifeboats or structural elements.
* **Overlooking the ship‚Äôs age:** Older ships may have less soundproofing, making certain cabins noisier.
* **Not checking elevator locations:** Rooms near elevators can have higher foot traffic.
* **Not looking at deck plans:** Use available deck plans to understand the ship layout.

# Checklist for Booking Your Cruise Cabin:

* Determine your budget.
* Identify your priorities (view, quiet, space, etc.).
* Research cabin categories and locations.
* Check deck plans.
* Read reviews.
* Book early.

# Finding Deck Plans:

* Visit the cruise line's official website.
* Use online cruise travel agencies, like [CruiseDirect.com](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-100903172-9224301).
* Consult cruise forums and communities.¬†

# Final Thoughts: Where Is the Best Room on a Cruise Ship? üèÜ

The **best room location on a cruise ship** depends on your needs and preferences. If you want a smooth sailing experience, choose midship on a lower deck. If you prioritize stunning views, an aft balcony may be your best choice. No matter your preference, researching and booking early ensures you secure the perfect cabin for your dream cruise.

I have worked as a chef in a commercial kitchen (food to order from websites). It became extremely overwhelming due to workload per person in the past few weeks and I literally started panicking et . whenever an evening came and I knew I have to go there the next morning.
I was under an enormous amount of stress basically, could barely sleep for a few weeks and so on and simply know that I won't be able to work 1 more day is said place. I honestly fel like a miserable s*it working there recently and the ignorant and very sarcastic new management wasn't helping my mental health either.

Anyway, I gave my resignation letter last Friday. The notice period is 4 weeks. 
I have been out sick due to work related stress for slightly over a week now.

I started applying to coffee shops instead. 

I know personally that this environment was and will be FAR less stressful for me; I've worked in coffee shops for quite a few years in the past and ended up in this current place simply due to being desperate while job hunting.
I have just received an offer for an assistant manager position, but I would be starting from Monday or Tuesday at the latest next week.

The coffee shop in question is a small, private shop which isn't getting very busy etc. as I have been going there personally for quite some time to grab a coffee.

Could anyone possibly help me in this situation? What are my options? I have already mentioned in the resignation letter that I give it due to ""personal problems"" and that I will provide a doctor's note for the notice period.

I'd really appreciate some help, as I was never in such a situation before, but maybe someone else was and could potentially help me.

1iyl1t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AHSEmployees/comments/1iyl1t7/thank_you/,Thank you.,"Hi.

I'm a (now) former AHS employee. I worked five years on the Connect Care project and have been very vocal about advocating for our public health care system, AHS, and everyone who works within it. I was the guy who pressed ""start steam"" on [Protect our Province](https://www.youtube.com/@PoPAlberta)'s live streams, amplifying doctors, nurses, and advocates when the government was absent at the height of the pandemic. The group still works in the background, if you were wondering. I ended up being listed on the GoA's hit list and recently forced out. (Yes I'm retaining an employment lawyer)

I worked on the Connect Care project, ensuring that everything scanned, printed, and communicated with the system. From fetal monitoring, anesthesia carts, OR trackboards and status boards, we validated it all.

The work took me from High Level to Lethbridge, where I flew on an eight-seater plane and had my rental car egged by idiots in La Crete who thought I was there to shut down the town.

I am so proud of my team's work but I'm more proud of the folks that I encountered and the folks we supported.

I remember being scrubbed in on a heart and lung transplant at the Maz because they were worried specimens wouldn't print (they did). Levelling with the OR nurse about the change and slowing his roll was huge that night in 2019.

Through my journey, I heard so many stories from docs, RNs, and LPNs. I witnessed so many acts of selflessness. I often have these stories come back to me.

From the PH nurses in High Prairie who told me about how they worked 13-16 hours working screening, sustaining repetitive stress injuries reaching under the plexiglass, also moving to work the long-term care facility after the very first COVID-19 death in the province while relentless media who lurked outside scrutinized every bag of trash they took out to the bin... I heard you, I saw you. I witnessed your tears. You could have refused the work but you did it for your community.

To the nurses and docs that moved into the new GPRH and had to figure out where shit was to care for their patients, I heard you, I saw you. I stripped down to my boxers to give up my scrubs in the L&D because the outsourced laundry company didn't provide enough scrubs for the crash team to rush into the L&D OR for a Code Pink. That was the longest and coldest trip down an elevator to the IT space I had ever taken. But baby and mom lived. Workstation on Wheels be damned.

I will never forget the lifeless RAH ICU at the height of the Delta wave, the lights set low, everywhere I went I was met with the clicks and hisses of ventilators, patients in closets where nurses played ""whose line is it anyway?"" Patient families sitting in the lobby outside the ICU, hoping they could sneak in behind me to see their loved ones. I was just there to replace a tap badge reader. You were there keeping people alive. You were there for the families when they didn't.

It's these stories and others I can't share because of how close they are to patients that keep me up at night, That renew the fire in me to keep showing up to rallies and fighting against this government so hell-bent to vilify AHS. 

I have been a patient and knew exactly where I was being wheeled around the UA ER trauma area because of my work there. Being terrified of needles and having my first IV, were so patient. Mad props to Dr. Stauffer and UA trauma team for being so fucking amazing, though I didn't need to see my veins through the ultrasound. Kids may love it, me, not so much. That's okay. You did what you could to put me at ease and through some clever trickery, got what you needed and ultimately cared for me despite my dismay at the time. That's some damn talent right there and I'm so grateful.

No one deserves any of this bullshit.

Politicians rarely remember that our very first and very last breaths happen in our hospitals. They are sacred spaces that should be devoid of politicization or privatization.

I don't know what this post was intended to achieve, but I am adorated and indebted to how selfless healthcare workers are. [I spent a few months delivering coffee cards to various departments](https://chadohman.ca/coffeeforhcwsab/); it was the least I could do on behalf of nearly 200 Albertans.

I guess in short, despite all the bullshit coming from the government, thank you for all that you do, have done, and will do. You are appreciated, you are loved, and you are needed.

Quick info: I like studying in coffee shops, so the things I considered in my rating are the taste of the drink, sockets, vibes, and ambiance (if it is okay for studying).  

1. Onward Cafe: Coffee tastes good! There are sockets, but the place is kind of small but very aesthetic. They play good songs too! I almost ask the barista for the playlist. You can study there peacefully! They have wifi pala. Their pastries tasted dry, so I do not recommend them, but I will visit pa rin because of the coffee and vibes.  

2. Starbucks High Pointe: Coffee tastes like typical Starbucks. Baristas are nice! But, i find it a little small for typical starbucks and gets too crowded. They're open for 24 hours, though, but I end up leaving early because Smart has no signal there (maybe because of my seat din; I sat near the saksakan kasi). They offer 1 hour of free wifi pala but will probably not visit anytime soon.  

3. Pancho Cafe: I find the prices too high just because the taste is so underwhelming. The vibes are slightly ""eh,"" but they have a lot of sockets. Free wifi too! The cake is nakakaumay pala. They have this secret room inside, so it's quite spacious naman, and you can study for a long time.  

4. Caffera: The place looks cozy and cute. The lights will make you sleepy, though, but they are open till 12 am. Drinks are so-so but reasonably priced naman. No free wifi but has saksakan. 

 5. The gram cafe: Smol cafe but very mura. They have spaces on the 2nd floor. I don't think they have free wifi, but they have sockets naman. Coffee tastes so-so for the price (ranges from 90 to 150 if I'm not mistaken).  

6. Starbucks Maysilo Circle: My go-to coffee shop because I can stay here for 4-5 hours. Gets crowded during peak hours, but after that, pretty cozy na. Baristas are nice, and there are sockets naman. Drinks and pastries are  the usual Starbucks. They give good recommendations too if you don't know what to drink.   

7. Dunkin': Coffee tastes good! They don't have sockets in the Boni Ave. branch, unfortunately. You can stay there naman, but I don't think the place is conducive for studying.  

PS. Nihon Cafe: I DID NOT try, but the cafe's small; this is near SB High Pointe Pala. I checked because I was supposed to make lipat here. Crowded kahit late na. : (

All help & advice appreciated. I need to remain anonymous and wish to not be doxxed for obvious reasons. And trying to be concise. 

I had been presenting at a work conference. After the event I stayed for drinks with my new team. I took my bags back to the hotel, then met two girls from my team for a drink. After we shared a bottle of wine, we ventured to meet the event organisers and wider colleagues. I sat with the two women I brought with me, never interacted with the wider group. We were pretty much separate from the wider group. I have texts and selfies etc of looking happy at this point. 

We move to the next bar - buy a drink and stood with my back to the bar in a kind of semi circle with two women and an extra colleague I know who came to say hello. From behind me right to left to right - this man I didn‚Äôt even know half danced / shimmied next to me then as he was doing this - he just grabbed my right boob. I literally went into shock. I turned to the person next to me and said ‚Äúdid he just grab my t*ts?‚Äù Hell ensued - it turned into chaos..his own manager said to someone ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just groped someone - get him out of here‚Äù and then everyone was trying to drag him into a taxi. He was completely drunk and out of control, numerous people I don‚Äôt even know have told me this several times since. 

In this melee I was left trying to work out who he even was. I didn‚Äôt know him, his name nor that he even worked for the company. I ended up grabbing my coat and going outside to try and get some details. Nobody was actually helping me and just trying to get this guy into multiple taxis who was refusing to go. I ended up having an argument in the street because I left so unsupported and they were trying to brush it under the carpet. Nobody would give me details, just he works for a very very senior manager. I eventually left, in tears on my own in a cab. Nobody came with me to check I was ok, nor make sure I got back OK. The party continued for the others. 

I wake up at 6am, cancelled my calls for the day and got ready for the office. I have texts where one of the party goers asks what I‚Äôm doing today ‚ÄúLOL‚Äù then tries to give my number to the perps manager before I get into work to ‚Äúmake sure I‚Äôm ok.‚Äù I said no.

I went to work, and within about 5 minutes I burst into tears (never in my life cried at work). Then dragged into an office to go through what happened. I had to pick him out of a teams photo. My boss was brilliant but what transpired by ‚Äúwitnesses‚Äù was casual misogyny dropped into the conversation. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had worse.‚Äù - My manager was disgusted with the attitude of the witnesses.

I was then sent home - on my way I receive a call from a colleague who wanted to grab me for a coffee (he was there the night before). Stupid me, thought he cared for my welfare. When I said I wanted to go home, he said I needed to leave it as ‚Äúdrunken shenanigans.‚Äù I needed to think about my career and long term networking prospects apparently. 

As a woman who lives alone. What transpired in the next few days - I lost my head. My LinkedIn was going viral, I kept getting anonymous views from the company.I gaslit myself by people gaslighting me. I didn‚Äôt eat or sleep for nearly 5 days. I doubted myself, I literally lost my sense of reality. I thought I was the worst person in the world who does nothing but ruins peoples lives and I hate to say it, s_______ ideation. I just couldn‚Äôt do it to my family. I thought I couldn‚Äôt ruin their Christmases forever. I lost it. I never told my family any of what has happened. People who know me commented ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been myself lately‚Äù when I‚Äôve seen them since.

After I drove myself insane I was then told by another woman I once called a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù - he had grabbed her bo0bs earlier in the night - before I got there. You‚Äôve let me drive myself into disbelief and despair and then drop that in there - so casually. I do look very similar to this woman, so I believe it was drunken mistaken identity.

In the middle of this despair I had a call with HR (supportive at this point) but I had mentally gone and couldn‚Äôt bring myself to give an official statement. Living alone and mentally ‚Äògone‚Äô - I just couldn‚Äôt. They said they had other witness statements so it would be ok. 

I asked HR for counselling and I was given an emergency call in which the counsellor was amazing (forever thank you to this lady.) They said I had PTSD from what happened and needed a course of treatment - booked me for another call. That call was cancelled (to be fair it was Christmas). I never received any other treatment/counselling/anything. The HR appointed counselling told me it‚Äôs not their speciality and I needed to pay for it myself. I asked for who they recommend -  chased up and all I‚Äôve ever had since was a generic email with a link to the Rape Crisis centre on it. That‚Äôs it. 

I‚Äôve spent the last few months fluttering between anger, sadness, apathy and then just trying to get on with my life. Insult to injury - I‚Äôve been placed under risk of redundancy by the company, and I found out the guy has got away with it on some bulls*** technicality of a defense. (Not told officially, been told by a Good Samaritan who was disgusted with the situation.) I could have walked into him in an office. No information or communication at all. 

I guess after all this, my question is - what are my options? Do I even have options?

I‚Äôve come away from the whole experience feeling dejected,invalidated, disbelieved - there‚Äôs zero justice. All those ‚Äúthinking of you, anything you need hun x‚Äù messages are absolute bull*** as I‚Äôve been left isolated like some inconvenient pariah (numerous examples since). My confidence and self-esteem is on the floor and I hate the company. I feel like there‚Äôs been zero duty of care and support by this UK leading organisation. 

The company itself is huge in the UK and prides itself on being a beacon of all things progressive and female leading. I feel if this can happen to me - it can happen to you. I need to know my options (if any) because I‚Äôm not satusfied and this cannot happen to another woman. This isn‚Äôt the 60‚Äôs, this is 2025 in the UK for women.

1iykpx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGirls/comments/1iykpx5/is_my_coworker_flirting_being_friendly_or/,"Is my coworker flirting, being friendly or attention seeking?","I (25F) work with this woman (25F), and while we started off as just colleagues, things have gotten a lot more friendly and there‚Äôs this playful energy between us.

For context, I‚Äôm more Tom-boy presenting, and she‚Äôs more fem‚Äînot that it matters, but I feel like it signals that I‚Äôm queer.

At first, our conversations were strictly about work, but over time, we started hanging out more. She lets me borrow her hoodie at work when I‚Äôm cold (I‚Äôve offered her mine before), pouts at me when she‚Äôs hungry or wants coffee, we‚Äôve shared drink and food before (like bite over my bite etc.) and always wants my opinion on clothes she‚Äôs thinking of buying. When I suggest something, she seems genuinely interested. And in the past, she‚Äôs even looked disappointed when I put my headphones in, knowing it meant we wouldn‚Äôt be able to chat as much.

Then, there was the day we went to a festival. We both ended up there from work, I lost my friends, my phone died, and my ride home disappeared. I ended up being the fourth wheel, but she shrugged it off, saying that without me, she would‚Äôve been third-wheeling anyway.

At the end of the night, she invited me to her place to charge my phone. She made me tea, gave me a hoodie to wear, and we sat on her bed while she took off her makeup. She shared a personal, funny story‚Äîsomething that wouldn‚Äôt come up at work. Then she casually mentioned I could stay over. I hesitated, unsure of what she meant by it. She kept saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to you,‚Äù and eventually, I decided to go home, mostly to avoid any awkwardness in the morning. If I had stayed, we would‚Äôve been in her bed, and I think I would‚Äôve left feeling even more confused.

I‚Äôve shared a bed with friends before, and normally, it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal. But this felt different‚Äîmaybe because of our dynamic, or the fact that this was my first time at her place. We aren‚Äôt exactly close friends or even outside-of-work friends yet, which makes me wonder‚Ä¶

You don‚Äôt just casually suggest something like that unless you‚Äôre extremely comfortable‚Äîor at least a little curious, right?

‚Äî‚Äî
UPDATE: Does she like me or my attention?

Recently I posted about a building friendship I have with a coworker. One that I think is a bit flirty.

TLDR: We are both 25F and very chatty/friendly at work. We talk on a more personal level now.

Yesterday I thought I‚Äôd do a little experiment.

In the morning she was super chatty as usual for the most part.

But in the afternoon she got busy/little stressed and she got cold with me (I felt that it was off) even when I asked her a work question so I just put my headphones in for the rest of the day (wanted to concentrate anyway).

When it got to the end of the day I just double checked everyone was good for the day and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm heading off‚Äù. As soon as I said it I started walking out and she went ‚Äúoh! Bye‚Äù with a little pout in a semi disappointed or somber tone. I stopped walking, looked back and said ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù Not in a blunt way but with a bit of a small smile and she ‚Äúnothing‚Äù with a small smile.

Kind of like she was expecting something before I left? Or maybe I‚Äôm reading into it too much.

Found this confusing because her and another coworker were going somewhere after work, so we were never going to walk out together tonight.

Then the next morning (WFH day) she sent a:

‚Äúhi, are you busy‚Äù message

Usually every would have stuff to do right in the morning and the conversation didn‚Äôt really go anywhere so I felt like she was reaching out for a reason.",2,1740566538.0,AskGirls,1,1.0,False

My wife was living in a house given to us by her mom and I in GA and I was working in TX and driving back to GA at the end of every rotation. We kept the communication going well at first I would call to wake her up for work and we would talk while drinking coffee over FaceTime getting ready for the day and she would call and talk to me about her day on her way home from work (we never missed a call).

During one of my rotations I started noticing slight differences in our communication patterns. When I would call some mornings she wouldn‚Äôt answer until she was already in her car and on the way to work and was too stressed out to talk to me for long. Following that was the evening conversations, for instance the calls would be made from her right as she got off and the day was just too stressful and she needed to listen to music on the way home and would offer to call me when she got home and unwound. I was cool with it because we just went through a big move and I figured she might be overwhelmed with everything going on with her new job and family etc‚Ä¶ so I was trying to be as patient and understanding as possible while still attempting to keep the communation flowing. Until those calls when she got home never happened and then I wouldn‚Äôt get a call until the next morning on her way to work with the same cycle of ‚ÄúI fell asleep when I got home and over slept I‚Äôve been so exhausted from work‚Äù. This went on for a week before the incident with this guy.

Slight re-wind before I get into the situation with this dude. While we were still living together at the base I was stationed at before moving to GA I over heard what I perceived as a ‚Äúflirty‚Äù conversation with this guy from our hometown at midnight while she thought I was asleep because I had a big brief the next morning very early. I didn‚Äôt handle it the best I‚Äôll admit I felt like something was going on and she eventually ended up convincing me after I talked to the guy that they didn‚Äôt look at each other like that and just had a good friendship and hadn‚Äôt been in touch in a while. We both agreed that if she were in my shoes at the time she wouldn‚Äôt have appreciated it either and it would not be a problem anymore. I was ok with it slightly still miffed about it but was able to move on and trust that she was honest to me about it. A few weeks later we went on leave and went back to our home town in GA to see family before I went on my final and ugliest deployment. While in GA we went to our favorite taco spot and she recognized him and informed me that was him and I said ‚Äúgood let‚Äôs say hey‚Äù I was friendly to the guy shook his hand firmly and looked him in the eyes before she says ‚Äúhey stranger!‚Äù And gives him a big hug. The way he looked at her after this I could tell he looked at her as more than a friend. I addressed these concerns and she re-assured me he may look at her like that but she does not view him the same way. I swallowed it and told her ‚ÄúI trust you‚Äù and I did so I brushed it off. 

Now back up to speed to the rotation where I noticed the communication changes. I started addressing the shift in communication I had noticed along with the location services we both used for assurance to start out of no where not work properly. I had began to convince myself I was going crazy and reading too deep into it and leaned on how tough my last deployment was on me mentally and blamed that and even told her I blamed the deployment and asked her to be patient with me and give me a little re-assurance when she could to keep my crazies at bay. The conversations on her end were always ‚ÄúI understand I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôll do better at talking with you more etc..‚Äù. She didn‚Äôt work Fri-sun and that Friday morning after going through this spotty communication for a week she calls to say she‚Äôs going to be hanging out with her mom and aunt all day and won‚Äôt be around her phone much. I responded with positivity happy at the fact she was getting to do something she enjoyed after a rough week and told her to have fun, sent money to enjoy herself with, and to call me once she gets to the house. Then that Friday evening around 6pm she calls me and informs me the guy that she was on the phone with late that night (before GA while we were still in the army) ran into her while she was out and asked her if she wanted to go grab a bite to eat since they had not seen each other in a while. She was checking in with me before she gave him an answer and even told him I want to make sure my husband is ok with this. I felt as if she was respecting the head space I was in and taking how I would view it into consideration and I have female friends that I have done the same with (after confirming with her) so it wasn‚Äôt a big deal at the time and told her to enjoy herself, asked she give me some details about when/ where they were meeting when she was able, and I sent her money so she didn‚Äôt stress about that and to imply to him that he isn‚Äôt paying for my wife‚Äôs food. 

I never received any information about when / where they would be going and assumed by dinner it meant anywhere from 7-8. I called her at 8 and asked if they were still going to eat she said yeah I‚Äôm on my way to meet him now and I replied with ‚Äúoh cool where are you guys gonna eat?‚Äù (At this point I felt secure with everything and wasn‚Äôt suspicious so I asked this out of genuine curiosity) she then replied in a very defensive tone and asked why I was questioning her about this and angrily said ‚ÄúBUFFALO WILD WINGS‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to bdubs and I‚Äôll call you when I leave! I love you bye!‚Äù This didn‚Äôt sit well with how defensive she got when I was simply asking for the reassurance we agreed to before doing this so I checked her location which lead to an apartment complex. At 10:15 pm she calls and said they ate had a good conversation about life and she left. I took it to the chin and realized I wasn‚Äôt in the right head space to have that convo without it turning ugly so I dropped it over night the next morning she calls me and just casually starts talking about her day and plans she was excited about. I addressed the location issue and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to accuse you of anything I‚Äôm just wanting transparency did you guys happen to eat at his apartment last night your location showed you there for a bit‚Äù and again responded defensively with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of being questioned and accused all the time‚Äù and I cut the conversation off there because nothing productive was going to come from that. Later that evening I decided I either could trust what she‚Äôs telling me is true and put it behind me and move on or I needed to leave right then and there. I chose option A and the next week our communication was right back to normal so I was able to pacify it. I came home after that rotation and she told me ‚Äúhe told me he was in love with me and tried to kiss me but I shut it down and told him I didn‚Äôt appreciate him trying to betray my marriage like that and I have blocked him from snap chat‚Äù (they only communicated through snap which isn‚Äôt out of the ordinary for her to communicate with anyone primarily through snap) at that time I had just gotten home from a month and a half long rotation and trusted her word and said thank you for being honest but these are things I deserve to know about when they happen. She said she knew how hard of a time I was having mentally and didn‚Äôt want to add anything on top of me. Which I cannot lie here, I was having a really tough time and was not myself in anyway (extreme paranoia, suicidal, manic, etc..) so I genuinely thought what would I have done ? I would‚Äôve probably waited to deliver that news in person so after that realization I accepted it told her thank you for not continuing to hide it this is an amnesty period if there‚Äôs anything else I should know please tell me now. She said that was everything and she was sorry for putting me in the situation. 

Fast forward to a couple months later I moved up in my job with the company and was able to afford my wife the opportunity to quit her job and focus on school and move out to TX with me and she was excited and eager to do it, all felt right in the world. Until one day I‚Äôm on my way home to our house and she had slipped and mentioned something about that night that didn‚Äôt match up with what she had previously said about the details. She had mistakenly said something about the restaurant but it was the wrong restaurant and all of a sudden all of my panic was back at the fore front of my mind and I called her on the discrepancy and addressed my concerns again about the location. She finally came clean and said ‚Äúwell while we‚Äôre here I didn‚Äôt want to tell you because I was scared of how you would react given the mental crisis you were dealing with but we never went to eat he got hung up at work so we met at a gas station when he got off and I followed him to his apartment where he was going to just change after work and then we would go eat he then invited me up to the apartment while he got ready so I wasn‚Äôt in my car waiting when we got to his apartment he tried to go in for a kiss after we hung out for a bit I shut him down and said I gotta go and ran out of the apt to my car‚Äù. Me in shock; I think something in me just kinda broke that day idk? But I responded with I know that wasn‚Äôt easy to admit and I appreciate it but I need to know right now what else do I not know. She has sworn to this day nothing else took place. 

Now here at present day I own my own company very successful for my age and the talks of kids and buying a house together are taking place and I feel like I‚Äôm not able to fully commit to continuing down this path with her because I can‚Äôt get the thought of there being something else I don‚Äôt know coming up randomly and wrecking me completely. 

So my very long winded question is do I leave her because I‚Äôm rocky on if I‚Äôll be able to fully trust her again. Or do I fully commit and take the plunge into making irreversible decisions to pursue a future together because things have been great between us for a while and it‚Äôs just us in TX no distractions, friends, family etc‚Ä¶ 

Any insight advice or telling me that I‚Äôm the problem are absolutely welcomed if I‚Äôm the problem here I would love to know and to anyone that read through this entirely and has insight just know I really appreciate you and needed you to read this. Thanks in advance for listening to my long winded craziness guys. ",34,1740566332.0,GuyCry,44,0.85,False

This is a new/throwaway to just speak on my crazy experience because I have no one to tell. 

TLDR; Met a man with the intention of a hookup and now its a potential SD. Need advice. 

I'm 23F and just moved to a major city this year. I'm quite inexperienced general relationship wise and was looking for some *fun* to kick off my time here. That led me to reddit to find a fwb. After browsing around our local communities I learnt initiating things (which I'm not used to at all) would be the only way to succeed. As such, on my literal third day, I messaged someone who had posted about their visit to this city (comes here occasionally) and was looking for some fun. And he replied. Unfortunately, scheduling didn't work out that first day and so we decided to meet the next. 

Now, full disclosure, I was looking for some NSA play (which would be my first ever btw) and so didn't really mind the quick nature of things. And I'm only truly free on weekends anyways. He asked to use a common texting app as I wasn't really accustomed to checking my reddit and was replying him infrequently. We moved it over there. 
We had already exchanged spicy pictures and so I was a bit confused as to why he wanted to see ordinary ones, but I obliged because I was very attracted to what I had seen. Now, I'm not conventionally attractive in the sense that I'm not slim or toned, but I do have what would be considered an ""attractive"" figure in our side of the world. But I am a little bigger than the ideal and my face is alright, pretty ordinary. He reacted pretty positively to it. I was relieved but not surprised because he'd mentioned when we shared the previously mentioned pictures on reddit that he liked what he saw. 

We discussed the basics, logistics, where he was staying and all. But then he asked what i was expecting. I took this to mean he wanted to know my boundaries for intimacy and all so I obliged. Then he asked if there was anything else and i simply said no. He then mentioned that he was up to make it a whole day thing, including lunch and an activity which threw me off a bit cause I thought it would just be a hookup.

Come the day of, I made my way to go see him but faced a few hiccups transport wise and ended up being late. He understood. I eventually made it to him, we had a coffee in the lounge of his hotel to assess the vibe and he was pleasant company. The conversation was great and he complimented what I do and even gave me some pointers career wise. He mentioned that I looked good and, during the conversation, threw in a comment about liking women who are confident in themselves. [Sidenote: I am confident in myself but I had learnt the hookup scene in this city is very cutthroat and so in my reddit profile I mention my looks and also emphasize them in the chat] 

We got to his room, I smoked and we got into it. It was SO great. Exactly the kind of thing I was looking for because my one and only relationship before that was pretty vanilla and one sided sexually. He was attentive, vocal and I could tell he has experience. 
We showered and headed out for a late lunch. There was engaging conversation and good banter. He then offered to get me a gift. That's when I started realizing that this wasn't going to be the ordinary hookup. 
He got me a wonderful gift box from a popular store, some perfume and a necklace. Now, I have a curfew and couldn't be out too late but then he offered to have me stay the night. I was enjoying myself so I considered it. He understood that it may not be possible and was patient with me as I tried to work around it. I worked some magic and was able to. He then took me to get a change of clothes for the next day, basics, a swimsuit and some lingerie. 
After we drove to a cute little spot and chatted over drinks and dessert. He asked about my relationship status and why I'd turned to reddit. I explained the above and that I'm single. He didnt comment further but he does know he was my first hookup. We got back to the hotel and you know the deal. I enjoyed my time with him, it wasn't odd or uncomfortable after the coffee and he seems genuine. 

The next morning is when he mentioned that he's open to sugaring whenever he travels and has asked me if that's something I would like as he has taken an interest. We've been chatting since. Now, I'm new to actual sugaring but I've been a spoiled girlfriend before. So I'm not opposed to it and might take him up on it. 

I want to know if anyone has experienced this and whether it's actually worth it considering there was no discussion about anything beforehand and how I should go about it if I do? I'll be replying, feel free to ask whatever.

**Chapter 5: Semicolon**

Utrecht,

The sky was overcast on this late September afternoon, and the air carried the characteristic freshness of early autumn. In this residential neighborhood in the north of the city, calm reigned supreme, disturbed only by the occasional passing car or bicycle.

Another bicycle split the air, its rider turning right before coming to a halt in front of a building. She dismounted, parked her bike in the designated parking space and locked it with a habitual gesture. Then, at a leisurely pace, she entered the building and called the elevator, which she took up to the fourth floor.

At her destination, she inserted her key in the lock and pushed open the door to her apartment. The place was silent... until a meow broke the ambient quietude. Her tabby cat approached her, rubbing its head against her leg.  
Her owner crouched down to gently scratch his head. The feline closed his eyes, purring under the caress.

She stood up and walked into the living room, where a surprise awaited her.

‚Äú*Happy birthday, Maya !*‚Äù

The enthusiastic voice startled her. ‚Äú*T-Thank you, Anna...*‚Äù she stammered before sketching an embarrassed smile. ‚Äú*You scared me, haha !*‚Äù

Anna replied with a knowing smile.

They had been sharing this apartment for over a year. Anna, a student at the Utrecht Art School with ambitions of becoming a professional draughtswoman, was looking for a new roommate after the departure of her previous one. Maya, for her part, appreciated the city's strategic location, which enabled her to travel easily for work between Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Almere, Amersfoort and Apeldoorn.

On the coffee table, Anna had laid out a small feast: a cake, cups and a bottle of sparkling wine. A smile lit up Maya's face at this thoughtful gesture.

They made themselves comfortable, cut a slice of cake and poured a little sparkling wine into their glasses. Anna, impatient, was almost stamping her feet.

‚Äú*So, how did it go ? Are you happy with the result ? Can you show me ?*‚Äù

Maya nodded before rolling up the sleeve of her sweatshirt, revealing her right wrist. A semicolon was now tattooed on it, protected by plastic film.

It was HER birthday present.

Once again, she explained to Anna the meaning of this symbol. Some time ago, she'd come across an article about its importance. A semicolon, a metaphor for a new beginning. It replaced the period given to her life by suicide, self-mutilation, depression or drug addiction.  
This tattoo was a reminder. A tribute to her own struggle, a way of reminding herself that she was still alive and celebrating it as a victory.

Anna nodded with a smile, then motioned for him to follow her to his room.

A canvas lay against the wall. Looking at it more closely, Maya felt her heart clench. It was a portrait of her, beautifully painted by Anna. She could see herself walking through nature, wearing a white dress with red stripes, a beret on her head, her long black hair blowing in the wind, a guitar case slung over her shoulder.

Tears welled up in her eyes. Maya thanked her friend warmly for the gift.

After a moment, Anna changed the subject, pointing to an air mattress set up in the room.  
‚Äú*As you can see, I've already prepared the inflatable bed for Mymy, and I've put the blankets on. For Coco, she'll sleep on the sofa, since your cat might be squatting in your bed tonight.*‚Äù

Maya noted this in her head while pointing out that Coco had medication for her cat allergy, so it wouldn't be too much of a problem.

Her sisters were due to arrive in Utrecht in an hour and a half. Just enough time to get ready. Anna had booked a Japanese restaurant for four, followed by a drink on the terrace, before finishing the evening quietly at the apartment. (Nightclubs ? Too noisy for Maya, she preferred intimate settings).

She headed for the bathroom to take a shower, taking care not to get her tattoo wet. The slightly hot water ran over her body. She ran a hand through her smooth, fine hair, down to her shoulders. Once a symbol of her teenage neglect, it was now one of the parts of her body she loved most.

Back in her room, she swapped her comfortable clothes for a more sophisticated outfit: a red and black top, jeans, a leather jacket from a thrift store, ankle boots and, of course, one of her trusty berets.

She began to apply her make-up, but as she reached for her eyeliner, her gaze fell on an old notebook buried in a drawer. Her diary. She picked it up delicately and sat down on her bed, leafing through it with her fingertips. She quickly skimmed through the first few pages, from the moment she started her diary at around the age of 15 to 2020, passing through the dark periods of her life.

She remembered the COVID period, when panic began to grip Europe from the end of February. Then began to read some of her diary entries about that period.

‚Äú**April 15, 2020**

**Hoi!**

**We've been confined for a few weeks now because of this virus. Me, I'm fine, I'm keeping my spirits up. Being cooped up at home, I've been through that before, so I guess you could say I've got experience. The hardest thing is not being able to see Anna, Arno or Bram. Fortunately, we keep in touch by message until we meet up again.**

**On the other hand, for some people... it's more complicated. Coco, for example, is a hyper-social person who spends her time between her rugby team and her music group.**  
**I began to see her less and less cheerful, more and more anxious. Then one evening, she came to see me in my room. She couldn't take it anymore. So I listened to her. We talked for most of the evening, and by the end of it, she was already feeling better.**

**For once, I was the one in a position to help, not the one who needed help. Since then, we've been doing activities together, sometimes with Mymy, sometimes with the whole family: movies, board games, video games...**

**It does us all good and helps us keep our spirits up in spite of everything.**‚Äù

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This parenthesis soon closed and everyone was able to return to a more or less normal life. At the end of the school year, Mymy and Coco continued their studies at university. Mymy went into law (she might learn that it's not very legal to invade cities...), while Coco turned to social work studies, a logical choice for her who has always loved helping others.

As for Maya, she felt a void at home without her sisters. Fortunately, she had her friends to keep her from falling completely into isolation. Her 18th birthday was just the way she wanted it: surrounded by her nearest and dearest, in a discreet atmosphere. Big parties weren't for her, too stressful.

But it wasn't her birthday that was the highlight of the year. It was Coco's.

Coco was able to have the house to herself on Saturday evening, despite the health restrictions. She invited her friends from high school, including members of her old band and a few players from her rugby team.

Maya wanted to be there for this passage into adulthood. No more excuses for being absent. She'd grown up. But this evening was stressing her out: too many strangers, loud music... She didn't know how to behave.

And yet, this was going to be a night to remember.

‚Äú**December 20, 2020**

**AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!**

**I just want to hide under my comforter and never come out. I'm so ashamed !**

**Well... I have to explain.**

**You knew, last night was Coco's birthday. I wanted to be there, but at the beginning of the evening, I didn't know where to put myself. I hardly knew anyone and Coco was busy with her guests. Luckily, Mymy was there. We chatted about her studies, her student life... and also her haircut: she's stopped dying it and her black roots are becoming more and more visible.**

**Then a rugby player from Coco's team came over and suggested we play drinking games. Mymy said yes. I followed her... so as not to find myself alone.**

**Fatal mistake.**

**I sucked. Almost every turn, I had to take a shot. I started to feel drunk... but more importantly, at ease. Free. Like I was breaking the chains that had always held me back.**  
**After that, it's all a blur.**

**I remember we played truth or dare. I must have given some information about my intimate life... Then I had to choose ‚Äúaction‚Äù at some point... and kiss Cleo. And I did. And I burst out laughing.**

**After the game, I needed to breathe. I went out and sat by the house. A few minutes later, Cl√©o, Yfke and Zoey joined me. Cl√©o wanted a cigarette, Yfke a joint. Still under the influence of alcohol, I chatted with them. Cl√©o was surprised that I'd kissed her, she didn't think I was capable of that.**

**Then Yfke asked me to smoke with her**

**Normally, I would have said no. But I felt... invincible. So I accepted. I coughed at first. I didn't know how to smoke. Cl√©o and Yfke taught me how. Then I started to feel light-headed. And to laugh.**

**After that...**

**Black hole.**

**Today, I woke up in the early afternoon, comatose, with a terrible headache. When I got to the kitchen, I found Coco, Cl√©o, Zoey and Mymy finishing off the remains of a cold pizza. Mymy burst out laughing at the sight of me, telling me that I'd put on quite a show last night and that she hadn't imagined me like that ! Coco thanked me for my moving speech. Except... I have no memory of making a speech.**

**Then Cl√©o got worried: she couldn't find Yfke, and asked for my help because I was the last one to be seen with her.**

**I went back to my room... and found her sprawled out on my bed, still sleeping. I woke her up and asked her what had happened. She explained that I'd invited her into my room, we'd smoked another joint and then I'd collapsed. She had slept there, with my permission.**

**In the afternoon, I helped my sisters tidy up the house... and above all, I cleaned mine to get rid of the smell of cannabis before the parents came home.**

**Conclusion: I'm ashamed. I feel like I've ruined Coco's birthday.**

**Added: I've received several messages... including one from Cl√©o and Yfke saying they had a good evening with me.**

**In the end... maybe I wasn't such a disaster after all.**‚Äù

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The school year continued as normal, and Maya's grades were good enough for her to enter university. The advice she'd received on how to manage her ADHD was very helpful.

Nevertheless, she wasn't sure what to do next. Not knowing what direction to take, she finally enrolled in a computer school. She liked spending time behind a screen and saw in this path the possibility of a profession with little social interaction, which suited her well.

But 2021-2022 was a difficult year for her. She found it hard to adapt to her new environment and pace of life. Her studies took her away from those closest to her, both family and friends. Little by little, a vicious circle set in: she had to work on the side to finance her schooling, but this demanded a lot of energy, so she wasn't always attentive in class. Her results were average, and she struggled to fit in with her new class. Not having the energy to go out or attend student parties, she found herself isolated, as she had been during her adolescence.

The final blow came when Arno announced their break-up. The distance and the change in Maya's behavior had taken their toll. Plagued by anxiety and a growing sense of unease, she began to use cannabis on a much more regular basis, thinking it would provide her with a refuge... but it only made the situation worse. As for Anna, their exchanges became increasingly rare. Maya was beginning to feel ashamed of giving her any news.

At the end of the year, she narrowly failed her first-year exams. Meanwhile, she watched her sisters pass theirs with flying colors.

That was the last straw.

And she collapsed again.

She returned to live with her parents, working odd jobs or helping out her grandparents. But the depression had returned. She was constantly comparing herself to her sisters, devaluing herself and isolating herself in her room when she wasn't working. She had become asocial again. Much of the money she earned went into her cannabis habit, the only person she kept in touch with being Yfke, who always had enough to supply her.

Meanwhile, her diary had been almost completely abandoned. Occasionally, she would scribble a few pathetic sentences, just to remind herself how much she hated herself, how lame she felt, how deluded she had been in believing she could succeed.

At first, her parents weren't overly concerned. They thought she was going through a complicated phase, that she would pull herself together and reorient herself later. After all, she was working a bit, not doing ‚Äúnothing‚Äù.

But as the months went by, they realized their mistake. Their daughter seemed sadder and sadder, more and more desperate. This time, Soei didn't dare to shake her as she would have done in the past. She was afraid of making the situation worse. Worse still, painful memories were resurfacing: she saw Maya again at 16, in the same state... and the fear of a new tragedy overwhelmed her.

Distraught, she contacted her two other daughters, who returned home briefly.

They were struck by Maya's condition. She was a shadow of her former self. This gripped their hearts, and they decided to do something about it.

Coco contacted her old friend Yfke again, asking her to stay away from Maya and help her take the first step towards withdrawal. Yfke reluctantly agreed, but finally understood the magnitude of the situation.

Above all, Coco and Mymy made contact with friends at the institute where Maya had been treated, notably Anna and Arno. A few weeks later, their plan was put into action: to bring Anna and Arno to Maya's house.

When they entered Maya's room, the sight was breathtaking. Darkness reigned. Maya, neglected and prostrate, looked even more despondent than the first time they had seen her at the institute, after her suicide attempt.

The first few minutes were difficult. Maya refused to look at them, too ashamed to let them see her like this. She wanted them to leave.  
But Anna was determined. She knew that Maya could still be saved. So she insisted, supported by Arno.

Finally, Maya gave in. She agreed to talk.

The three of them talked for hours. Gradually, Maya opened up, and at one point laid her head on Anna's legs as she sat on her bed. This simple contact brought her a semblance of human warmth.

In Coco's room, she and Mymy waited anxiously. They had supported each other throughout this new ordeal imposed on them by life. Suddenly, they heard Maya burst into tears, sobbing for long minutes.  
Then they began to hope. Perhaps their sister was finally opening up, releasing some of the negative emotions she had accumulated.

Silence returned. Long, heavy.

In the late afternoon, Anna entered Coco's room, saying that Maya was coming to stay with her for a while, and needed a change of scene.

Then they saw Maya leave her room, suitcase in hand.

She entered Coco's room and asked to be left alone with her sisters.

When they were alone, Maya spoke up. At length. She explained how she felt, what she was going through. Coco sensed that she was clinging to life again. So, without a word, she hugged her as tightly as she could.

Maya hesitantly wrapped her arms around Coco in a clumsy gesture.  
Then she burst into tears, soon joined by Mymy.

Between sobs, Maya timidly apologized for the worry she'd caused. Then, in a trembling voice, she reminded them how much she loved them.

They embraced for several long minutes, before Maya left the house.

And so, Maya went to live for the first time in Utrecht with Anna and another roommate, a literature student.

Determined to help her best friend, Anna looked for ways to cheer her up. She trusted her with the cooking, remembering the succulent bitterballen Maya had prepared the first time she came to stay with her. This was the first step in her reconstruction. Others followed: Maya went back to see a psychologist to treat her new-found depression, then, once she was feeling a little better, she found a food job to help Anna and their roommate out financially.

Little by little, Maya began to socialize again. Anna invited her to art openings, and she enjoyed the hushed, peaceful atmosphere of these events.

She also resumed writing her diary on a more regular basis, a sign that her mental state was improving.

Even so, doubts remained. What future awaited her ? She wanted a job she liked, a second chance to become independent. Sleeping on the sofa in the living room since her arrival, she sometimes felt like she was too much.

Fate then gave her a helping hand, thanks in part to Coco.

One of her teammates on the Dutch rugby team had to go abroad for a match, but she couldn't find anyone to look after her bulldog and two cats. Coco immediately thought of Maya. The task wasn't very complicated; all she had to do was follow the instructions left by the owner.  
It was a revelation.

**‚ÄúMarch 10, 2023**

**I think this weekend sent me a message.**

**I discovered that I love working with animals.**

**Of course, the task was made easier by adorable companions, and I enjoyed every minute spent with them.**  
**Even when I had to take the dog out in the rain late at night.**

**Do you think I could make a career out of it ?**

**I'll have to find out.‚Äù**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After some research, she found a petsitter training course starting in September 2023, which would enable her to acquire the basic skills needed to exercise this profession professionally.

At the same time, Anna's roommate had finished her studies, and Maya was given her room. Anna was delighted that she was staying on.

The year 2024 was a busy one: she completed her training and was officially able to start her business by registering on an online platform. The beginnings were difficult financially, but the positive reviews left by her customers enabled her to build up a loyal clientele. Gradually, her schedule began to fill up. Utrecht was ideal for this business: in less than an hour by train, she could reach most of the major cities in the Netherlands.

Maya leafed through her diary and rediscovered certain passages of her life. Despite her lack of social ease, she had been able to make connections. She'd had a disappointing love affair with a man, followed by a one-night stand with a woman. It was during this period that she realized she was attracted to both genders, and came to terms with it.

She also renewed her relationship with Arno. Although they didn't become a couple again, they enjoyed a beautiful friendship.

Then, reading her diary led her to Taco.

She'd met this cat dozens of times on her way to and from the station, always stopping to stroke him. One day, she found him with an injured leg. When she tried to identify his owners, she discovered that he didn't have any: he was a stray. She took him to a vet, then convinced Anna to adopt him. She named him Taco, in reference to the meal she had cooked for him the evening he arrived at their home.

Maya placed her diary on her desk and allowed herself to be distracted by a photo. It was one of the last where she appeared with her sisters, taken on Mymy's 22nd birthday.

In the picture, she was wearing a burgundy red high-collared sweater, jeans and her favorite red Converses. Coco, as elegant and athletic as ever, wore her eternally cheerful smile, a plaid sweater vest over a white shirt and black pants. As for Mymy, she'd changed radically, apart from wearing a suit, she'd completely abandoned her orange dye, ridding herself of any family pressure to return to Japan. She had regained her original black hair, which she tied back in a ponytail with bangs. From then on, she assumed more of her Asian origins.

A noise drew her out of her thoughts.

Anna knocked on her door.

‚Äú*Are you almost ready ? We'll be leaving soon,*‚Äù she asked.

‚Äú*Yes, just five minutes, please,*‚Äù replied her roommate.

Maya put the photo down, picked up her eyeliner and finished her make-up.

Before going out, she opened her diary one last time and wrote.

‚Äú**September 21, 2024**

**Dear Diary,**

**Today is my 22·µâ birthday.**

**As promised, I got my semicolon tattooed. I'm happy with the result.**

**I'm off to pick up my sisters, and I can't wait for the party to start.**

**You know, sometimes you can just decide to be happy.**

**So tonight, I'm going to be. Because I deserve it.**

**I did pretty well, in the end.**‚Äù

**Author's Notes:**

* **I want to first thank** u/minecreep4 **for the image that gave me the inspiration to create this whole story. If you haven't liked his image yet, here's the link:** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/zellig/comments/1h2667n/tormented\_coco\_corrupted\_maya\_au/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/zellig/comments/1h2667n/tormented_coco_corrupted_maya_au/) **. Feel free to leave him a message.**
* **I would like to thank everyone who liked my project by leaving me comments or likes, both on Reddit and on AO3. You have been a fuel for me so that I can continue my work.**
* **I also want to thank myself. I never thought I would make a forty-page fanfiction at the beginning of the year. I am happy to have contributed positively to the Ongezellig community. I was able to create my own ending to the series, even if my universe was darker and more mature than Massa's work.** 



**Notes on my fiction and abandoned ideas:**

* **The description of Coco in chapter 5 matches the drawing by LidlyArts that she recently posted on Twitter where we saw a 19-year-old Coco.**
* **Taco is inspired by the singer Taco, a Dutch and Indonesian artist, known for his cover of Puttin' On the Ritz by Fred Astaire in 1983**
* **The ending should have been different : Maya during her hospitalization would have written ""Ik ben het maar"". She should have sung it with the band Running in the 60's and had a hit at an end-of-year party. But Maya, uncomfortable with working with a band, preferred to continue on her own and try to become a solo singer by learning the guitar. On her 22nd birthday, she should have learned that she was going to do her first concert hall. I found the ending too happy. I think the ""petsitter"" ending suits her well and that chapter 5 shows that everything has not been rosy since her rehabilitation.**
* **I had an idea for the end of chapter 5 with a description of Maya's birthday party. There should have been more people present, including Yfke. Maya wanted to ask him for some cannabis to fight her anxiety. Maya having managed to wean herself off, this scene was no longer necessary.**
* **Maya and Yfke still remained friends despite the temporary separation wanted by Coco. Yfke started to reduce her consumption, especially since she works in a coffee shop.**
* **During this same birthday party, we should have learned that Vera had left teaching and was working in the music world where she was happier. In the end, I didn't find this story relevant and it was abandoned. However, consider Vera's reorientation as canon, she is no longer in teaching in 2024.**
* **Eiko should have intervened in chapter 3, she would have approached Coco and Mymy to apologize to them and provide her support in the face of Coco's suicide attempt. She feels guilty about what happened to Maya. The idea was abandoned because I had trouble seeing Eiko directly contact Mymy and Coco.**
* **It was supposed to be just a fiction, it could start creating an AU. I have four stories in mind. The first is called ""Vera's lost tapes"" and focused on the past of our depressed history teacher. The fiction was not supposed to have any connection to Death and Reborn but I changed my mind since. The second takes place at the time of the VOC and will not have any connection to my universe. The other two are kept secret because they will be directly linked to the Death and Reborn fiction.**
* **If I knew how to draw, I would have created an alternative ending to the story where Coco and Mymy find themselves together for Maya's 22nd birthday. The title of the comic would have been called ""She couldn't be saved"". And so you will have understood that Coco and Mymy would have gathered together on their sister's grave for her birthday. The latter was not saved by the doctors.**
* **Maya is therefore bisexual in my fiction, following the thoughts of some members of the community.**
* **The meaning of the semicolon tattoo is very real. I wanted Maya to have a symbol of her struggle that she led.**
* **I did not talk about it in the fiction but Maya changed her haircut during her hospitalization. She had mid-length hair.**
* **Anna, Arno and Bram are completely imaginary characters. They are the same age as Maya. Anna is a rather small and very thin person because of her anorexia nervosa, she is platinum blonde with wavy hair. Her skin is very pale. She has a large forehead that she has a complex about. Arno was more complicated for me to imagine. He has mid-length hair, sometimes wears a hat. He likes to dress in a red and black plaid shirt with a metal band t-shirt and black jeans, his build is normal. On the other hand, for Bram, I didn't really have any ideas. For the first names, I wanted first names in 4 letters to stay faithful to the series.**
* **What could Coco have said to make Maya furious? I never had the slightest idea in the end. It's up to you to imagine what she could have said.**
* **I checked that Utrecht was less than an hour by train from the cities mentioned in chapter 5. It is indeed the case.**
* **Chapter 4 was long and complicated to write. It is 22 pages in total and had to be separated into 3 parts. I discussed at length with Chat GPT regarding Maya, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãserved as a bit of a therapist and gave me ideas for questions and answers to give to Maya so that she goes on the right track. I added ideas during the writing.**",10,1740565921.0,ongezellig,10,1.0,False

1iykgm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceClubDiscussion/comments/1iykgm9/advent_no_3_plot_holes/,Advent No. 3 plot holes,"I‚Äôve seen a few opinions here, and while I agree with a lot of them, I wanted to add some of my own thoughts. I also saw a lot of people praising the author‚Äôs world-building abilities, but honestly, I don‚Äôt share that opinion.

First of all, it‚Äôs clear that Anton Atrii(author) was ‚Äúinspired‚Äù by Attack on Titan, though that‚Äôs already been discussed enough. However, my main issue isn‚Äôt with the plagiarism itself. Honestly, if the author had just copied the original, I would‚Äôve had fewer questions.

But instead, the author tried to reinvent the wheel by piecing together parts of a coffee grinder. The result is a mishmash of Attack on Titan elements combined with his own flawed ideas, but the original pieces don‚Äôt work well when removed from their original context. As the result it‚Äôs breaking author‚Äôs world logic and plausibility.   

So, I wanted to point out some of the mistakes and plot holes created by the author. Also give some examples of how it was done in Attack on Titan and why it worked there, but doesn‚Äôt work here.

1. The concept of an unknown enemy. 

‚ÄúTitans appeared out of nowhere‚Äù ‚Äî This works in Attack on Titan because of the somewhat medieval setting, where people didn‚Äôt know what lay beyond the walls. 

But in Advent‚Äôs world, we‚Äôre in the future. There‚Äôs electricity, air conditioning, labs, and cameras. Why not just attach a camera to a drone and figure out where the threat is coming from?

Fine, maybe flying titans could knock down the cameras. But what about satellites? Why didn‚Äôt anyone think to check satellite imagery? The titans didn‚Äôt attack everywhere at once, so someone could have looked up and figured out what was going on and where they‚Äôre coming from. Problem solved.

2. The Walls

I already saw someone talk about it, but wanted to mention one more thing. 

The construction of the walls also doesn‚Äôt make sense. People are surrounded by titans, and building huge walls takes years. Even if the titans didn‚Äôt attack all cities at once, the logistics of constructing such massive barriers in such a short amount of time don‚Äôt add up. Not to mention, the walls don‚Äôt withstand attacks from these giant monsters. The titans can fly over them or dig under them ‚Äî so what‚Äôs the point of having them at all?

In Attack on Titan, the walls themselves were unbreakable, and there was a mystery behind their construction, which was explained later in the story. But the author of this work didn‚Äôt seem to bother with these details.

3. What have the reconnaissance been doing?

In Attack on Titan, the scouts faced immense losses and spent years trying to gather any bit of information. They had to figure out how to kill titans by targeting specific weak spots, and they didn‚Äôt have modern technology to help them. That‚Äôs why they spent years exploring beyond the walls with little success.

In contrast, the local scouts here have modern weapons, cameras, and transportation. The titans can be killed with basic attacks, so why haven‚Äôt they figured out where these titans are coming from and why? It just doesn‚Äôt make sense.

4. The Global Underground Rail Network

To me, of the most puzzling element in this story is the Magistral, the high-speed underground rail network that supposedly connects different continents.

A) How Was It Built?

The Aides, those worm-like titans, live and travel underground. The author himself even mentions that they‚Äôre tough opponents because they literally live in the ground. So, how did humanity manage to build an underground highway under constant threat from these creatures? And why they haven‚Äôt destroyed it yet? 

B) How Was It Built Across Oceans?

The cities in this world are on different continents (for example, in Canada and in Japan), separated by vast oceans. The average depth of the Pacific Ocean is nearly 4 kilometers. Also the author claims that this Magistral is a ‚Äúring‚Äù. But how could they build a high-speed rail network at such distances and depth in just 48 years, especially while the remaining remnants humanity were battling underground monsters? For comparison, the Eurotunnel took 7 years to build just 50 kilometers!

This concept just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. If humanity had the technology to build such an underground highway across oceans, surely they would have the means to figure out where the titans are coming from and how to stop them.


In short, first two episodes didn‚Äôt impress me. Maybe the author will come up with some brilliant, logical explanations later on, but for now, it all feels weak and full of holes. I do hope the story gets better, but as it stands, it raises too many questions that either don‚Äôt have a logical explanation yet, or, if answered, would break the world‚Äôs logic and its original rules.

Also sorry for any mistakes, English isn‚Äôt my first language üôèüèª
