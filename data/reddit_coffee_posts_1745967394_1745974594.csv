Some of you might‚Äôve seen my last post about feeling totally lost ‚Äî especially around Fenway üòÖ

But today something shifted a bit. I had my first class at BU, didn‚Äôt get hopelessly lost on the T, and even managed to grab a quiet coffee in Back Bay before heading to work. It felt‚Ä¶ normal? Like a glimpse of the version of me I came here to become.

I know I‚Äôm still figuring it all out ‚Äî the people, the rhythm, the weather mood swings (wow) ‚Äî but for the first time I didn‚Äôt feel completely like an outsider.

Anyway, just wanted to say thanks to those who reached out with advice and kindness last week. Boston still overwhelms me, but today it also made me smile.

1kb3y46,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1kb3y46/burnout_and_filling_your_cup/,Burnout and Filling Your Cup,"Apologies for the long post in advance, but I think giving some of my context will help. I am 40, single, child free, and work as a high school teacher. I am medicated for ADHD, I see my therapist every two weeks, I exercise regularly, I eat as well as I can (it's complicated and food advice will most likely be disregarded), I socialize regularly, I drink water, I do all the things I should be doing (the eating notwithstanding).

I've been in acute burnout for about a year, and chronic burnout since about 2019 (not that I recognized it at the time). I left a very stressful and toxic relationship (that ended when he had major emergency brain surgery and then haf an emotional affair), started and finished grad school, moved countries, had a serious health issue that almost killed me, and have basically had to remake my life from the ground up. If you would have asked me at the time, I would have said I was fine. I was not. I'm really bad at recognizing when I'm not doing well.  And as my therapist and I have been working through some of the issues around my eating disorder, we are finding again and again that my eating disorder, ADHD, and burnout are very tangled. 

She tasked me with identifying the symptoms of burnout at different levels, so we could be more aware of where I was and how things were changing. 

So me being me, I decided to separate the levels of burnout into three categories: healthy, teetering on the edge and putting my toes into burnout, sunk by burnout. I also decided to create a list of all of the things that help me feel better and replenish me (both the self-soothing and self-care side of things). I then ranked them because not all things are equal. 

Things in each category (Not a complete list):
- Level 1: petting dogs, reading books, good cheese, making things, little indulgences, new stories, out of the blue phone calls, getting coffee
- level 2: D&D nights, board games, cookies, new things to think about, my patio swing, new experiences, Lego, getting mail, exercise
- level 3: drunk calls, Northern lights, having a clean apartment, being excited, the sauna, good food, time with friends 
- level 4: good meals with friends, gifts, laughing till I can't breathe, good conversations, having tea made for me, 
- level 5: feeling loved/ appreciated/ heard/ understood, affection, having meals made specifically for me, being able to be excited without a mask 

My problem is that while I have lots of things in the level 1 and 2 category, with the exception of having a clean apartment, everything in level three, four, five is reliant on someone else. And I'm not expecting one person to cover all of this, I do not expect that at all! But my question is, what else can I do to add to those levels of things that legitimately will help me get out of burnout? I'm already doing the basics like drinking more water, trying to sleep more, exercising regularly, taking things off my plate, but none of those things are filling my cup, they're just slowing down it getting worse. 

All of the most important things for me are connection-based, I think part of the reason I am having such a hard time actually getting out of burnout is that I frequently don't have those things. And I don't want all of the things that have the most oomph to be dependent on someone else. 

What has been on your level three, four and fives? I'm at a complete loss, and I'd be really appreciative of any suggestions.

1kb3y1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kb3y1r/does_getting_back_together_ever_work_out/,Does getting back together ever work out?,"A couple days ago, my boyfriend semi-unexpectedly dropped the breakup conversation on me. I knew things weren‚Äôt going well, but it‚Äôs finals season and we‚Äôre both anxious about summer internships so I thought some of it might be that. I was having some issues, too, but we had a really productive conversation about a week and a half ago so I was hopeful that we were moving onto more stable ground.

We were on a walk really late at night, and he starts opening up about some mental health issues he‚Äôs been having. We wind up talking about the problems in our relationship, and I thought it was actually going really well. But then he told me he exchanged nudes with some stranger on Snapchat earlier that week, and I kind of broke down. (For context, he‚Äôs always maintained that exchanging nudes with strangers is just like porn, so he didn‚Äôt consider it cheating.)

As I‚Äôm crying, he‚Äôs going on about how he doesn‚Äôt know whether he loves me. He says he cares about me and doesn‚Äôt want me to get hurt, but he doesn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs even capable of love. On top of that, I have some people-pleasing issues, and he feels like I‚Äôm not working on them/cant bring up things that bother me so it just festers. On top of that, he feels like we‚Äôre incompatible because I‚Äôm more conventional-acting in public whereas he sees it all as pointless and arbitrary (as long as no one is actually hurt).

He also said he felt like we didn‚Äôt really connect over shared interests. I agree that we have issues, but I don‚Äôt agree that they can‚Äôt be fixed. But he said that he wasnt going to break up with me unless I agreed. After about a five hour conversation with lots of tears and apologies and whatnot, I told him I wanted to go to bed and resolve it in the morning, but he said he really wanted an answer before we went to bed, so I more or less just let him break up with me. Like I said the words ‚Äúwe‚Äôre breaking up‚Äù but‚Ä¶ idk. We agreed to tell people it was mutual.

We‚Äôre getting coffee next week, partly by my request the morning after because I instantly regretted breaking up (not that I had much of a choice?). But a short break through finals week with a revisiting at the end of the week was one of the options thrown around, so I actually have no idea where we stand.

If he is open to it when we see each other next, is it even worth trying to get back together? I miss him so much, and I regret breaking up with him, but there are real issues in this relationship. I‚Äôd only agree to get back together if we both get into counseling and lay some serious ground rules.",1,1745974398.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I've tried making a 'peak' at the top of the grounds but the filter on top then ends up tipping to one side and making things worse. Is there some way I should be arranging my grounds to encourage even distribution of water?

Hey r/StremioAddons community!

Easynews++ has been updated to v2.4.0 with several improvements to enhance your streaming experience. Here's what's changed:

# Major Enhancements:

* **Enhanced Logging System**: Better debugging and traceability throughout the addon [\#70](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/pull/70)
* **Improved UI**: Updated landing template with support button and improved styles [\#62](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/pull/62)
* **Enhanced Stream Descriptions**: Added publish date to stream descriptions for better content selection [\#68](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/pull/68)
* **New Size Comparison Logic**: Better handling of file sizes for optimal streaming [\#68](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/pull/68)
* **Improved Sorting**: Fixed sorting logic for better stream organization [\#69](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/pull/69)

The addon should now output significantly more stream sources than before, as the crawl limit has been increased from 150 to 500. However, this may also result in a longer waiting time for stream sources. If you notice that the waiting time often exceeds 30 seconds, I need your feedback to adjust the limit again.

# Configuration Improvements:

* **New Stream Quality Options**: Added new configuration options for more control over stream quality and file size filtering [\#52](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/pull/52)
* **Environment Configuration Support**: Better configuration handling for different deployment scenarios [\#58](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/pull/58)
* **Winston Logging Integration**: Enhanced logging capabilities for better troubleshooting [\#59](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/pull/59)

# Infrastructure Updates:

* **Docker Compose Support**: Added Docker Compose configuration for easier self-hosting [\#54](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/pull/54)
* **Streamlined Structure**: Cleaned up addon structure for better maintainability [\#53](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/pull/53)
* **Reduced Logging Verbosity**: Changed logger level from info to debug for various messages [\#64](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/pull/64)
* **Simplified Codebase**: Removed catalog handler and related code, making the addon more focused [\#67](https://github.com/pantelx/easynews-plus-plus/pull/67)

# How to Update

* **Self-hosted**: Pull the latest version with `git pull` or update your Docker image
* **Public Instance**: Already updated and [Hosted on Cloudflare](https://github.com/panteLx/easynews-plus-plus?tab=readme-ov-file#-quick-links)

I'm doing Duolingo for Dutch, however I acknowledge I will not be even a novice by October - this is also just on me having difficulties learning any language.

I did a lot of looking around from Google Maps, Reddit posts, looking at sites, and other things. My fianc√© and I are going in early October, staying near Artis. Trying to get the things we both enjoy - a nice cocktail, fiance loves cats and animals, I want to go to the Red District (can't help being a tourist). We love smoking, and she loves the Beatles, hence the trip to Alkmaar for day five. I'm Dutch by blood, so I want to see where my ancestors lived for centuries, down south about an hour on day six. I know Day Three is stacked, but a lot of those things are pretty quick, and I believe we'll have time on most days for just walking around.

We're going to get a car for day five and six. 

I plan on getting tickets for everything the end of August, where I'm hoping I'll be able to get Artis and the Anne Frank Museum tickets, which aren't available yet.

So far I am on a pretty bad streak with Tinder dates. I am ready to skip to the part where we are settled in, all cozy on a Sunday morning, sipping coffee together in a room full of plants. 

 I have had my excitement, plenty of experiences to look back on in my old age. I do not need too much excitement. A slow burn type of romance, co regulation- someone who grounds me. 

I am a reader, violinist, and I love astrology. I am comfortable in nature alone, at a drag show, in church; I can even hold my own in a court room. Because of this, I don't really have a ""type"". I am a chameleon, I tend to adjust to my partner's preferences. I do not take people for granted. 

I like to be direct about topics that may be uncomfortable. I feel that it's better when we do not assume. I like to make agreements about commitment early on, whatever that looks like for us. I also have a bit of a stubborn streak, so I need someone who is not going to allow me to (accidentally) bulldoze them. I am the oldest daughter and I act like one. 

I would like to ease in and have a combination of messaging, voice calls and video calls in the early stages. I prefer to meet in person relatively quickly, within 3 months. ",1,1745973447.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

[My sister Laura, her friends, all drowned.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17o761o/i_still_hear_the_footsteps_in_the_rain/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) At least that was what we were told. We attended a funeral, but not all the bodies were recovered. Laura‚Äôs was gone but three of her friends were recovered. It gave some glimmer of hope that she was not dead, just missing. After a year though, it seemed unlikely she would be found. The area had been searched. We were told that divers went into the lake to try and find the missing ones, but no one could.

It was devastating for my family. But what I could not understand is what exactly happened. All we knew when she left was that Laura was going on a trip with her friends last year for spring break. It was a place in the mountains several hours away. The lake Kashur Resort and Spa. Apparently they had gone into the lake one night during a storm. They had allegedly been drunk and somehow each one of them had drowned. The proprietor of the place was unable to be reached for comment, but authorities said that all evidence pointed to a tragic accident.

Normally I would not have done anything but grieve for the loss of my sister, but then the letter arrived. It was from a man named Tim. He was the sole survivor of my sisters trip, he had an outlandish tale of impossible things that sounded like the delusional ravings of a person with survivors guilt.

The authorities' statement, predictably, clashed with his deranged ravings. They insisted it was a drunken swim party gone awry, resulting in an accidental death. But I never believed it, not about my sister. She was far too controlled to get intoxicated, and even if she had, she would never be so careless. Yet, the official investigation was stalled if not ended entirely.

The letter was genuinely disturbing, a cryptic tale from my sisters former friend,

""I can still hear their screams echoing in my mind. All of them. Adam and Gina were the first to fall, the splashing footsteps, swallowed by water, it was impossible. Yes, they drowned‚Ä¶but not in the lake. Laura, Becky, and I managed to reach the resort, the staff left us to fend for ourselves! Those things, the shapes, they followed us there.

They were in the rain, the lake, it was our fate, sealed and inescapable.

Forgive me, Becky, Laura. I tried, I really tried, but I was too late.

I am sending this to any of your family member who will listen.

I beg you, do not let them get away with this. They knew. They knew what would happen.""

It was the creeping madness of that letter that made it seem like a fever dream, or a drug-induced delusion. Yet something in Tim's words, the raw terror that bled through his scrawled handwriting, made my skin crawl with a truth I couldn't explain. I put the letter away and departed.

I struggled with the decision to reach out to the man to verify the details of his story. I had sent a letter hoping for a response, yet he remained silent, and I lacked his contact number. I learned he had relocated to Nevada, and the idea of traveling such a distance just to confront him felt overwhelming. His statements to the police seemed too outlandish to take seriously, yet part of me couldn‚Äôt shake the nagging curiosity about the truth behind his claims.

I had to know for sure, so I made the decision.

I would go to Lake Kashur and try and find my sister or at least say goodbye to her at the last place she was seen.

The trip took nearly seven hours, rain pelting my windshield most of the way. Though gloomy, the drive was not unpleasant and the area was admittedly beautiful. The further I drove, the more isolated the roads became, until I was winding through dense forest on a single-lane road that didn't appear on my GPS.

My phone disconnected and reconnected for the tenth time before losing the signal completely.

Just when I began to think I'd made a terrible mistake, the trees parted, revealing Lake Kashur Resort and Spa. It looked impressive, though unpopulated. The main building, a sprawling three-story lodge with weathered cedar siding, boasted against a backdrop of fog-shrouded mountains. Several smaller cabins dotted the shoreline, their windows dark and uninviting.

The lake itself stretched vast and resplendent, its surface rippling despite the absence of wind. Though it was impressive and serene, something in the shifting waters made my skin crawl.

A sign on the road indicated: ""Welcome to Lake Kashur - Where Memories Run Deep.""

Someone had scratched something beneath it, but it looked like a thin layer of slap dash paint had been applied over it, trying to cover whatever message someone had attempted to carve into the sign.

I parked in the nearly empty lot, only a resort truck and a few cars were there. Pulling my jacket tighter against the chill, I grabbed my bag and headed to the entrance as the skies darkened and thunder rumbled. Inside, the dim lobby was lit by antique fixtures casting long shadows across the polished floors, and I moved toward the reception desk.

A rustling sound came from behind the reception desk before a woman appeared, her movements so suddenly I nearly jumped.

""Welcome to Lake Kashur,"" she said. ""Do you have a reservation?""

""No, I was hoping to speak with someone about an accident that happened here last year.""

She studied me for an uncomfortably long moment. ""I am sorry we are not able to disclose details of any incidents that happened here to the press.""

""Well no, I am a relative. My name is Connor, I'm here because my sister stayed here last spring. Laura Hanson? She would have been in a larger group of people visiting for spring break. Could I check the guest book?""

Something flickered across her face.

""I'll need to get the manager,"" she said abruptly, reaching for a phone beneath the counter. She turned away slightly, her voice dropping to a whisper. ""Mr. Dalton? There's a young man asking about an incident. Yes, last spring."" She paused, listening. ""Yes, sir. Right away.""

She hung up and fixed that empty smile on me again. ""Mr. Dalton will be right with you. Please wait just a moment.""

Before I could respond, a tall figure emerged from a doorway I hadn't noticed before. He moved with unsettling grace for someone so gaunt, his impeccable suit hanging from his frame as if from a wire hanger.

""Gregory Dalton, proprietor of Lake Kashur Resort. I understand you have questions about your sister.""

He gestured toward a seating area away from the desk. ""Please, let's speak somewhere more comfortable.""

I followed him to a pair of leather chairs positioned near a window overlooking the lake. The rain had intensified, drops streaking the glass like tears.

""Laura Hanson,"" he said, folding his hands in his lap. ""Such a tragedy. I remember her vividly. Bright young woman. Studious. Not like the others in her group.""

The way he described her was uncannily accurate. I leaned forward. ""If I could be direct, what do you know about what really happened to her, Mr. Dalton? The official report says they drowned, but my sister was an excellent swimmer.""

Dalton's eyes flicked toward the sound before returning to me.

""Rules exist for a reason, Mr. Hanson. Sometimes tragic ones."" His voice lowered, almost hypnotic in its rhythm. ""Your sister and her friends were warned, as all our guests are, that swimming during rainfall is strictly prohibited at Lake Kashur. A liability issue, you understand.""

""That doesn't make sense. Why would rain make them drown? And if there was a rule, Laura wouldn't break it like that.""

""Peer pressure can be a powerful motivator, even for the most disciplined among us."" He sighed, a practiced sound of rehearsed regret. ""They were young. Exuberant. Perhaps they thought our warnings were superstitious, many do.""

I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the draft in the old building. ""What exactly are you saying happened?""

""They went swimming during a storm much like this one."" Dalton gestured toward the window. ""The lake can be unpredictable. Currents shift. Temperatures drop suddenly. People lose track of how far out they swim and then, well‚Ä¶By the time our staff realized what was happening, it was too late.""

The explanation, although hard to accept, was not entirely implausible. But still, something in his delivery felt hollow, like reciting lines from a well-rehearsed script. The pieces didn't fit. Tim's letter described something far more sinister than careless swimming.

Thunder echoed over the lake as Mr.Dalton glanced at the window. Rain poured down, churning the lake's surface. Before I could speak, Mr. Dalton interrupted,

""My sincerest condolences to you in this time of sorrow. Should you wish to remain with us for the night, I would be honored to have you stay. We have another group of young people here on break and you might enjoy their company. Besides, another tempest has arrived, and traveling amidst such torrential rain would be most perilous. Naturally, I shall provide full recompense for your night's stay, a mere token of solace in light of the profound loss of your dear sister.""

I hesitated, the conflicting information warring in my mind. I could investigate further if I stayed, maybe even find some evidence about what really happened to Laura. On the other hand, every instinct screamed that something was deeply wrong with this place.

""That's very generous,"" I said carefully. ""I think I will stay, just for the night, thank you.""

""Excellent,"" Dalton replied, his thin lips stretching into what might have been a smile. ""Room 217 should accommodate you nicely. It overlooks the lake and is close to‚Ä¶"" He stopped himself. ""Well, it has a splendid view.""

Close to where Laura went missing. He didn't need to finish, I knew that guarded look and it made me even more suspicious of just what they were hiding here.

The receptionist arrived with a brass key marked 217. ""Dinner is at seven,"" Dalton said, rising fluidly. ""Feel free to explore, but stay indoors and avoid the lake while it rains, for safety.""

""Of course,"" I agreed, accepting the key.

Dalton abruptly left, and a bellhop guided me to the second floor. The whole place had an eerie emptiness; only staff seemed to be lurking around.

The woman handed me the key and left without a word..

Inside, the room was tastefully furnished with slightly worn antique pieces, a queen bed, a writing desk by the window, and a newly renovated bathroom. The view, described as splendid, showed only a rain-beaten lake and a mist-obscured inlet. I wondered if that was where Laura went into the water?

I considered Tim's letter again. How he mentioned ""shapes in the rain"" and ""footsteps splashing on the ground."" At the time, I'd dismissed it as trauma-induced hallucinations, but now, staring at the churning lake, I wasn't so sure.

The rain intensified, drumming against the window with an almost deliberate rhythm. Thunder cracked overhead, and for a split second, I thought I saw something move beneath the lake's surface, a pale, elongated shape that wasn't there when I looked again.

The floor outside my room creaked. I froze and listened. Then I heard a shuffling sound, followed by what sounded like water dripping onto the carpet. Not the usual footsteps of someone passing by, but something different, heavier.

I crept to the door, pressing my ear against it. The dripping sound continued, followed by a strange, wet rasp like someone struggling to breathe through fluid. My hand trembled as I reached for the doorknob.

Suddenly a soft gurgling voice spoke to me, it sounded like a voice trying to speak underwater.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶need to leave. Not‚Ä¶safe, they come tonight, the sacrifice is prepared. They will awaken, and all must drown who still draw breath here‚Ä¶‚Äù

I was paralyzed with fear at the ominous warning and before I could turn the door handle and confront the mysterious voice, the sounds receded down the hallway, fading into silence. I exhaled shakily, backing away from the door. I had no idea what the hell was going on there.

I sat in confusion as a flash of lightning illuminated the room one final time,then nothing. The rain drumming on the window abruptly ceased. The sudden silence was almost more unnerving than the storm had been.

I approached the window cautiously. Outside, the transformation was startling. The lake had become a perfect mirror, reflecting the clearing sky with such precision it was difficult to discern where water ended and air began. Not a single ripple disturbed its glassy surface. The mist had vanished, revealing the entirety of the shoreline in crystalline detail.

I had heard enough, something was very wrong here and I knew it was a mistake to have come at all. I checked my phone and saw it was 6:45 PM. Dinner would be served soon, the distraction might offer some cover for getting out of there.

I slipped outside and rushed to the parking lot. To my horror I saw that all four tires of my car were now flat. Someone had deliberately slashed the tires, intending to strand me.

My mind raced and despite my first instinct, I paused. I considered it must be Mr. Dalton, had he wanted to keep me here for whatever he was planning? I was alone and unarmed though, so I would not confront now, I just needed to leave. My heart pounded as I backed away from the car, considering the mile or two walk back to the highway. Just then, I heard laughter and chatter near the main building, the other guests Dalton mentioned. Relieved, I followed the voices to a courtyard, where five people in swimsuits stood with drinks in hand.

They were heading to the lake despite the approaching darkness and recent rain. I figured they might be able to help me get out of there, so I followed them and discovered a small cove, partially hidden by rocks, just as Tim described. A weathered wooden dock stretched twenty feet into the water. Had Laura stood here before she vanished?

As I moved toward the dock I saw the sign, bold red and indicating,

‚ÄúAbsolutely no swimming in the rain!‚Äù

They were very serious about that rule, and yet not much effort to enforce it if people just came out here and it started to rain.

The group of swimmers were making their way down the path toward the dock, their voices carrying clearly across the still night air.

""Dude, this place is amazing,"" one of the guys said, his arm slung around a girl's shoulders. ""Totally worth the price of this place.""

""I still can't believe we have the whole resort practically to ourselves,"" another girl replied, her blonde hair catching the moonlight.

""The old guy said swimming during bad weather is not recommended,"" one of the taller guys said, mimicking Dalton's formal cadence. ""But what he doesn't know won't hurt him.""

""I don't know, guys,"" a brunette girl hesitated, hugging herself. ""Did you see how he looked at us when Jake asked about swimming? It was creepy. For all we know they have hidden cameras or something.""

""Come on, Melissa,"" the guy with his arm around her urged. ""The rain stopped. It's perfect out. When will we ever get another chance like this? It's gorgeous out!""

The group stopped abruptly when they spotted me. An awkward silence fell over them.

""Hey creep what the hell?"" One of the guys called out. ""You work here or something?""

I realized they were talking to me as I was watching them from the tree line. I shook my head, stepping back toward the shore. ""No. Just a guest, like you.""

They visibly relaxed, though the brunette, Melissa still eyed me with suspicion.

""Sweet,"" said the guy who seemed to be the leader. ""We're just gonna take a quick dip. You won't tell the staff, right?""

I hesitated. These were just college kids looking to have fun, exactly like Laura and her friends had been.

""I don't think that's a good idea,"" I said, surprising myself with the firmness in my voice. ""There was an accident here last year. People died. Listen, I think we need to leave, there‚Äôs something wrong with the people who work here, something‚Äôs off. Someone slashed my tires and I heard something about a sacrifice.""

The group exchanged glances. After a pause, several of them burst into laughter.

""A sacrifice? Seriously? Did the old man put you up to this? What's next, a hook-handed killer who preys on couples making out?""

""I'm serious,"" I insisted, stepping closer. ""My sister was here last year. She drowned in this lake with her friends. The only survivor sent me a letter about things in the lake that came out when it rained. Please, just listen to me.""

My desperation must have shown through because some of their smiles faltered. Melissa bit her lip. ""Maybe we should go back. I didn't like the vibe of this place anyway.""

""Oh come on!"" the other girl exclaimed. ""We paid good money for this weekend. I'm not letting some random dude with a sob story ruin it.""

""Look, I'm not trying to scare you,"" I said. ""But something's not right here. The manager, the staff, they're hiding something. And my tires‚Ä¶""

""Your tires probably got punctured on the crappy road getting here,"" Jake interrupted. ""Happens all the time in these backwoods places.""

Thunder rumbled in the distance, a sound that made my blood run cold despite the clear sky above us.

""Weather's turning again,"" the tall guy noted, glancing at the horizon where dark clouds were gathering with unnatural speed. ""Maybe we should head in, just for a bit.""

Jake shook his head stubbornly. ""One quick dip. We'll be back before the rain hits.""

Before I could protest further, he was sprinting down the dock, the others following with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Jake dove in with a splash, followed by two others. Melissa and the tall guy hung back, watching from the edge.

""Come on, it feels amazing!"" Jake called, treading water.

I took a step back as The sky darkened with impossible speed. One moment clear, the next churning with black clouds. The distant thunder wasn't distant anymore, it cracked directly overhead, making the dock vibrate beneath my feet. The first drops fell,

""Jake, seriously, let's go!"" Melissa called, backing away from the edge. But something was happening to the lake. Where it had been glass-smooth moments before, now the surface rippled oddly, not from the rain or the swimmers, but from below. Concentric circles formed around the three in the water, as if something was rising toward them.

""You guys need to get out now!"" I yelled.

They reached the shore and were panting, but all okay apparently. They looked to each other and then the lake and started laughing.

‚ÄúAh man, nothing happened. Thought the Loch Ness Monster would come out to play or something with all the build up.‚Äù They continued laughing with only the girl named Melissa grimacing and looking around nervously. I watched the lake as the rain intensified and was disturbed by how the water began to roil, less like a lake more like an angry ocean.

The lake's surface began to churn violently, waves forming where there had been none before. The rain suddenly intensified, shifting from a gentle patter to a downpour in seconds.

A light in the distance cut through the darkness from somewhere behind me, sweeping across the shoreline. I raised my hand to shield my eyes as the powerful beam briefly illuminated me, casting my shadow long and distorted across the lake. The light was impossibly bright, like a searchlight but stronger, scanning methodically across the water's surface. Two sharp, piercing whistles sliced through the air, mechanical, like an old steam engine announcing its arrival. The sound echoed across the lake, reverberating in my chest.

""What the hell is that?"" one of the guys shouted, pointing toward the source of the light.

I turned to look, but the beam had already moved on, now sweeping across the turbulent surface of the lake. In its path, I could see something disturbing the water, not waves, but shapes moving beneath the surface, pale and elongated.

The group scrambled away from the shore, grabbing their belongings in a hurry. Through the increasing downpour, I noticed movement on the resort's main driveway, headlights cutting through the rain as several vehicles pulled away from the lodge, fleeing in haste.

""They're leaving us,"" I whispered, a cold dread settling in my stomach. ""The staff is evacuating, they know something is going to happen."" I considered the mysterious words about a sacrifice and my heart sank.

Before anyone could process what was happening, a red pickup truck with flashing emergency lights lurched down the path toward our position, its tires spraying mud and gravel. It skidded to a halt at the edge of the cove, and the driver's door swung open.

Mr. Dalton emerged, no longer the composed proprietor but a man possessed. His thin hair was plastered to his skull, his expensive suit soaked through. In his hand was something that looked like an antique lantern, its blue flame impossibly bright despite the rain.

""It happens faster every year, as if your cohort becomes increasingly less intelligent,"" he sneered with a chilling chuckle. ""Simple rules for simple minds. Honestly, if we made a rule stating that you would die if you didn't swim in the rain, your contrarian nature would probably guarantee that the Drowned ones would never wake again. Yet, here we find ourselves."" His eyes glinted with a sinister amusement as he sighed deeply, ""I fear you're all fresh out of luck.""

I couldn't process his words at first, they were too crazy, too detached from reality. But the cold calculation in his eyes told me this wasn't madness. It was something worse.

""What do you mean 'fresh out of luck'?"" the group's leader Jake demanded, stepping forward. ""What the hell is going on?""

Dalton ignored the chaos, focusing on me. ""You should've stayed in your room, Mr. Hanson. The lake is off-limits during rain, as I warned. Now you'll see what happened to your sister. The cycle continues. The lake must be fed. Die well."" With that, the truck sped off.

Terrible splashing footsteps echoed on the ground by the shore, like something heavy emerging, yet nothing was visible. Everyone froze in fear. Suddenly, a scream pierced the night, cut short as a girl was dragged across the wet ground, clawing at the earth. An unseen force, rain turned solid, pulled her toward the water.

""Help me!"" she cried, terror in her voice. Two men lunged, grabbing her wrists, forming a grim tug-of-war against the invisible pull.

""Don't let go!"" she sobbed, her eyes wild with fear.

But something was wrong with the rain where it touched her skin. It wasn't running off but collecting, thickening, taking form. Pale, elongated fingers materialized from the raindrops themselves, clutching at her legs, her waist, multiplying with each passing second.

Soon her scream was smothered by a rush of water forming from nothing over her head, drowning her on the edge of the water.

In the next moment the girl's body was pulled free from her attempted rescuers and she was yanked backward with impossible force. She didn't even have time to scream again before she was submerged, the lake swallowing her whole without a splash, as if she'd never existed at all.

""Jenny!"" her friends screamed in unison.

The remaining swimmers stood on the shore, their panicked screams barely audible over the hammering rain. I stood frozen, processing the horror of the situation. This was what happened to my sister. It wasn't an accident. It was a sacrifice.

""Run!"" I shouted to the others, finally breaking free of my paralysis. ""Get away from the water!""

But it was too late. The rain itself seemed to come alive, droplets coalescing mid-air into translucent shapes. One man was pulled off his feet by invisible forces, dragged through the mud as he screamed and clawed at the earth. Clinging to a tree trunk, his grip failed as rain shaped into fingers pried him loose.

""We have to get to the lodge!"" I yelled.

We sprinted through the rain, surrounded by translucent figures with featureless faces, water streaming from their elongated limbs as they moved toward us unnaturally. The lodge loomed ahead, dark and imposing against the storm-wracked sky. The front entrance stood partially open, swinging lazily in the wind. Not a single light burned inside.

""They're gone,"" the tall guy panted as we raced up the steps. ""Everyone's gone.""

We burst through the doors into the cavernous lobby. The reception desk was abandoned, drawers hanging open as if someone had left in a hurry. The elegant furniture that had seemed so welcoming earlier now cast grotesque shadows in the dim emergency lighting.

""We need to barricade the doors,"" I gasped, already shoving a heavy armchair toward the entrance. Melissa and the tall guy joined me, dragging a coffee table and an antique bench to block the way.

""I've got my car,"" Jake said suddenly, fumbling for his keys. ""It's right out front. If I can get to it, we can drive out of here!"" His eyes were wild with a desperate hope. ""I'll bring it around to the door. Be ready to jump in!""

Before I could stop him, he bolted toward a side exit, keys clutched in his trembling hand.

""Wait!"" I called after him, but he was already gone, the door slamming shut behind him.

Melissa and I pressed our faces to the window, watching as he sprinted through the downpour toward a blue sedan parked near the front steps. Splashing footsteps in the rain were appearing all around the building and parking lot with each passing second.

""Come on, come on,"" Melissa whispered, her breath fogging the glass.

The rain intensified and it became difficult to see anything outside. We pressed our ears to the glass and then recoiled when a disturbing scratching sound was heard on the other side of the door. It was followed by a voice out of a nightmare,

""Please... let us in,"" came a wet, gurgling voice from the other side of the door. The sound was unmistakably human yet horribly distorted, as if the speaker's lungs were filled with fluid. ""It's me... Jenny. I'm so cold... I can't breathe out here.""

Melissa stumbled backward, her hand flying to her mouth. ""That's her voice,"" she whispered. ""Oh God, that's Jenny's voice.""

""Help me,"" the voice pleaded, higher now, desperate. ""I'm drowning... please... it hurts so much.""

Water began seeping under the door, not in the usual way rain might trickle in, but purposefully, gathering into a puddle that crept across the floor toward us.

""Don't listen,"" I hissed, pulling Melissa farther back. ""That's not Jenny. Your friend is gone.""

A second voice joined the first, this one deeper but equally waterlogged. ""Sam... please... open the door. I can't... hold on much longer."" The voice choked and sputtered. ""The water... it's filling my lungs.""

""Matt?"" Melissa whispered, her face ashen. She took an involuntary step forward before I grabbed her arm.

""It's not them,"" I insisted, though my voice trembled. ""It's whatever took them. The same thing that took my sister.""

The frantic scratching grew louder against the walls and door. Tears streamed down Melisa's cheeks as she sobbed into her hands. Beside her, Sam gently comforted her with a soothing voice and embrace. Distracted by the unearthly voices pleading to be let in, we missed what was happening outside. Jake reached his car, the engine roared, and headlights pierced the darkness as he reversed.

For a moment, hope surged within me. The sedan backed up rapidly, aiming for the lodge entrance. If he could get close enough, we could make a run for it.

But something was wrong. The car was moving too fast, careening backward at a speed that suggested panic rather than control. Through the rain-streaked windshield, I could see the Jake was wrestling with the steering wheel, his face contorted in terror.

""Something's in there with him,"" I realized aloud, just as the sedan crashed through the barricade we'd erected, splintering the wooden barricade and shattering the lobby doors. Glass and splinters exploded across the marble floor as the vehicle smashed halfway into the building before grinding to a halt, its rear wheels still spinning.

""Jake!"" Melissa screamed, but her voice died in her throat as we saw what was happening inside the car.

The interior was filled with water, impossibly contained within the vehicle like an aquarium. Jake thrashed within, his mouth open in a silent scream, bubbles escaping his lips as he pounded against the windows. His eyes bulged, pleading for help we couldn't provide.

And then I saw them, the pale, elongated figures sharing the flooded car with him, their translucent hands wrapped around his throat, his ankles, his wrists. One of them turned toward us, a faceless head composed entirely of water, and I swear I saw a smile ripple across its featureless visage.

But worse than the horror inside the car was what was happening behind it. The rain creatures were flowing in through the shattered entrance, seeping around the sedan's frame and reforming inside the lobby. They moved with terrible purpose, water flowing upward against gravity to shape humanoid figures with long, reaching arms.

""Upstairs!"" I grabbed Melissa and Sam, yanking them toward the grand staircase. ""We need to get higher!""

We frantically clambered up the steps, the relentless splashing footsteps echoing behind us with a chilling consistency, never hastening or faltering, as inevitable and inescapable as death itself.

We reached the second floor landing, gasping for breath. The hallway stretched before us, doors lining both sides. Some stood ajar, inviting us into their deceptive safety.

""My room,"" I panted, pointing down the corridor. ""217. We can barricade ourselves in there.""

A flash of lightning illuminated the hallway through a large window at the end of the corridor. To my horror, the window was wide open, rain pouring in freely. The water wasn't behaving naturally , instead of simply splashing onto the floor, it gathered in midair, coalescing into those same terrible forms we'd seen outside.

""They're already inside,"" Melissa whispered, her voice breaking.

We looked behind us to see more water creatures ascending the stairs, their movements fluid yet somehow wrong, like stop-motion animation played at the wrong speed.

""Run!"" I shouted, pulling Melissa toward my room. Sam sprinted ahead of us, but as we passed the open window, a watery tendril shot out, wrapping around his ankle. He stumbled, crashing to the carpet.

""Help!"" he screamed, fingers clawing at the hallway runner as the tendril began dragging him back toward the window. I lunged for his outstretched hand, our fingers brushing for a split second before he was yanked away with impossible force.

""Sam!"" Melissa shrieked as he was pulled toward the open window, more tendrils materializing from the rain to envelop his body. His scream transformed into a choking gurgle as his head disappeared beneath the watery surface.

""We can't help him!"" I shouted, watching in horror as Sam's struggling form was enveloped in water that seemed to materialize from nowhere, covering him.

We made it to her room and slammed and locked the door. I ensured the windows were closed and barricaded the door. We sat in terrified silence as the horrifying sounds of the things outside pressed inwards.

Melissa collapsed onto the floor, trembling and sobbing uncontrollably as the reality of what had happened to her friends sank in. I checked the bathroom for any water source, relieved to find the taps dry when I turned them. Small mercies.

""What are those things?"" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the pounding rain outside. ""This can't be happening.""

The scratching began at our door, soft at first, then more insistent. Water seeped beneath the doorframe, forming a small puddle that began to grow despite our attempts to block it with towels.

The voices called, a horrible chorus of drowned friends. ""We found something amazing in the lake. You have to see it. Please let us in.""

Melissa pressed her hands over her ears, rocking back and forth. ""Make it stop,"" she begged. ""Please make it stop.""

We waited, helpless in the room for what felt like hours. None of the things got in, but we could not get out. Then the sound of the rain stopped. The ghoulish voices begging us to let them in stopped as well.

It was the rain! I remembered what the letter said, they came with the rain. We had to take our chance and leave now.

""We're leaving,"" I said, my voice stronger than I felt. ""Now.""

Melissa looked up at me with red-rimmed eyes. ""But what if they're waiting? What if...""

""If we stay here, we die,"" I cut her off, gripping her shoulders. ""The rain's stopped. Those things... they come with the rain. That's what happened to my sister.""

I moved to the window and peered outside. The storm had broken The lake gleamed under the dull shades of the coming dawn.

""We need to get to a car,"" I said. ""Any car.""

""Jake's is still downstairs,"" Melissa whispered, pushing herself to her feet. Her face was pale but determined.

We crept to the door, listening for any sounds beyond. Nothing but silence greeted us. I turned the handle slowly, wincing at the slight creak as the door swung open. The hallway was empty. Not just of water creatures, but of any trace they'd been there at all.

We moved cautiously down the stairwell.

""I don't understand,"" Melissa whispered as we reached the first floor. ""How can everything be normal?""

The lobby told a different story. Jake's car remained half-embedded in the shattered entrance, a grim reminder that not everything had been reset. But the vehicle was empty, no water, no Jake, just the keys still dangling from the ignition.

""Let's go,"" I said, moving toward the car.

Melissa hesitated. ""Shouldn't we look for the others? Maybe they're still alive somewhere.""

I shook my head, remembering Laura, remembering Tim's letter. ""They're gone. If we stay, we'll be gone too.""

The car's engine sputtered to life on the first try. I reversed it carefully over the broken glass and splintered wood. As we pulled away from the lodge, I glanced in the rearview mirror. The building loomed dark and silent, its windows reflecting the faint light of the rising sun like empty eyes. We drove down the winding road through the forest, both too traumatized to speak at first.

""I'm so sorry about your sister,"" Melissa finally said, her voice small in the confined space

I nodded absently, my knuckles white on the steering wheel. ""I just wish I knew what really happened to her. If those things took her like they took your friends.""

The words died in my throat as a single drop of water hit the windshield. Then another. And another.

""No,"" Melissa whispered, her eyes widening in terror. ""Not again.""

Rain began to pelt the car, increasing in intensity with unnatural speed. I pressed my foot to the accelerator, the sedan lurching forward on the narrow road.

""Faster!"" Melissa urged, twisting in her seat to look behind us.

I heard it then, the unmistakable sound of splashing footsteps keeping pace with the car. Not on the road, but somehow beside us, within the curtain of rain itself.

""Connor‚Ä¶""

My blood froze. It was Laura's voice, clear as day, coming from just outside my window.

""Connor, why are you leaving me?"" The voice was perfectly my sister's, yet horribly distorted, as if she were speaking through water. ""I've been so alone.""

""Don't listen,"" Melissa warned, her hands pressed against her ears. ""It's not her.""

But I couldn't help myself. I glanced toward my window and saw a pale face formed in the rain, Laura's face, her features rippling and flowing but unmistakably hers. Water streamed from her hair, her eyes, her mouth as she clung to the car, impossible yet undeniable.

""Please, Connor‚Ä¶I'm drowning‚Ä¶help me."" Her watery fingers pressed against the glass, leaving no marks yet somehow I could feel the chill of her touch through the window.

I swerved, nearly sending us off the road. The tires skidded on the wet asphalt as I struggled to keep control.

""Don't look at it!"" Melissa screamed, but her eyes were fixed on her own window where Matt's face had formed in the rain, his features twisted in agony.

The windshield wipers worked frantically, slicing through the apparitions only for them to reform instantly. Laura's voice grew more desperate, more insistent.

""You promised you'd always protect me‚Ä¶why did you leave me here? I'm so cold‚Ä¶so dark under the water.""

My chest constricted with grief and guilt. ""I'm sorry,"" I whispered, tears blurring my vision. ""I'm so sorry, Laura.""

""Pull over,"" her voice coaxed, sweet and terrible. ""Just stop the car. Let me in. We can be together again.""

For a heartbeat, my foot hovered over the brake pedal. The longing to see my sister again, to speak with her one last time, was overwhelming.

""Connor, don't!"" Melissa's hand clamped down on my arm. ""It's not her! Remember what happened to the others!""

The spell broke. I stomped on the accelerator and eventually the voices receded as well as the rain.

My sister was gone, what was left there was not her. Melissa and I made our way back to what we believed was safety, but I recalled Tim and his survival and realized we would never really be safe again. Those creatures had marked us, and they would relentlessly pursue us. The rain, once a simple part of nature, had transformed into a constant harbinger of our impending doom.

That was all two months ago. Melissa and I stayed in touch after our escape from Lake Kashur, bound by a trauma no one else could understand. The official report blamed a flash flood that claimed her friends, another tragic accident like Laura‚Äôs.

I tried to explain what really happened, rain forming into people, drowned voices, and a proprietor who fled, leaving his guests as sacrifices, but it sounded insane. They offered grief counseling and quietly closed the case.

I‚Äôve spent hours researching Lake Kashur. Ownership records reveal a history of ‚Äútragic accidents,‚Äù yet Gregory Dalton‚Äôs name is missing, as if he never existed. The most disturbing find was a 1937 newspaper clipping showing Dalton at the resort‚Äôs opening ceremony, unchanged by time, looking exactly like he did when I saw him in person.

I had no idea who or what he really is and I don‚Äôt know if I will ever know.

Tonight, it is raining again. Even with the blinds drawn, I hear the voices, splashing footsteps, and fingernails scratching at the glass. Melissa calls these episodes ‚Äúhauntings‚Äù, fitting since the dead spirits will never give us peace.

Now, as the relentless rain pounds on every sealed entry, my phone buzzes. Melissa whispers, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre outside my building, I can hear them calling, Matt, Jenny, everyone.‚Äù I tell her to stay put and follow our safety plan. Even so, the hauntings grow more relentless, and I fear I may not last much longer. I fear I will never be free, from this drowning cycle of death.",1,1745973446.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

We were chatting, enjoying ourselves, when she suddenly asked me if I had feelings for another girl. I was taken aback because I genuinely only have feelings for her, and it felt disrespectful to be asked that out of nowhere.

Here‚Äôs the context she brought up: A couple of months before we started dating, I subbed for a female friend‚Äôs volleyball team. After the game ended early, I walked her to the train station. It was a friendly catch-up, nothing more. I tried explaining this to my partner, but then she asked if I had sent any follow-up messages to this friend. I didn‚Äôt think I had, so I said no.

Then she asked to see my phone. I felt uncomfortable‚Äîit felt like I was being interrogated, and I hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong. But I wanted to reassure her, so I showed her the chat. Turns out, I did send a message. My friend had texted, ‚ÄúThanks for subbing today and thanks for the orange,‚Äù and I replied, ‚ÄúAnytime.‚Äù (It‚Äôs a silly inside joke about oranges and my grandma‚Äôs fictional orchard.)

Now my partner is upset. She says I lied to her and need to apologize and make it up to her. From my perspective, I didn‚Äôt lie‚ÄîI honestly forgot about the message because it was such a non-event to me. I have zero feelings for this friend and didn‚Äôt think this interaction was worth remembering. She then said that my initial hesitation to show her my phone meant I was trying to hide something.

So, AITA for standing my ground and not apologizing?",1,1745973410.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False
1kb3lye,https://www.reddit.com/r/SBU/comments/1kb3lye/why_is_peets_so_derpy_on_campus/,Why is Peet's so derpy on campus,"So last semester, I discovered there was a Peet's Coffee on campus. And obviously, I was ecstatic about it, good coffee and a good place to study. A few of my friends had known about it so also good company. Over the semester, a few of them had some trouble with orders and things like that, nothing out of the ordinary for an on campus food place. It happens, people here are bad at listening and also reading. So today I go in and order my usual, a bagel toasted with cream cheese and an iced latte. Thats it. Nothing crazy like an avocado sandwich with a coffee drizzled in caramel and a shot of espresso. Literally just a toasted bagel with cream cheese and a plain iced latte. Now, I ordered the coffee first and the guy repeated it back and said ""Is that all?"" and I continued and said ""Can I also get a bagel toasted with cream cheese?"" And he took my dining card, no confirmation or anything. Forgot to mention, the guy who took my order actually landed in the quad in a UFO, got out, kissed the ground and shouted ""It's my first day on Earth."" When he rang it up, it looked like an unfamiliar number and I was confused but there's no reason a bagel and coffee shouldn't only cost $9 so I just sat down. SO I wait 30 minutes for my order, cause that's Peet's specialty on this campus even though there were 4 people in there. And I get my coffee, its perfect. They really cooked on this one, it was like God himself came down and handcrafted this iced latte. I went another 10 minutes for my bagel. I'm like okay my coffee is good, I can live with this and a few more people came in so they are busy. My name gets called and I go up, get my bagel and sit down. Bro... just a loose bagel. Toasted with nothing on it. Okay so usually I'd totally understand if they just didn't hear me but at this point it's been 40 minutes since I've ordered so I'm feeling hangry tbh. I go up and I'm like ""Hi I ordered cream cheese on this and it came plain."" I'm met with the deadest stare of all time, followed by ""you ordered it plain.""... Bro who would order a loose toasted bagel. Am I a hamster with cream cheese or butter hidden in my cheek? So I'm like ""oh sorry I did order it with cream cheese"" and she's like ""Can I see your receipt?"" Bro I literally John Cena'd that bad boy into the trash immediately. We'll be lucky if it hasn't already been recycled to make a paper straw. She prints out a whole new receipt, and hits me with the ""You didn't order cream cheese so you have to pay for it."" Okay whatever, I'll pay for my cream cheese even though they made the mistake, maybe I did forget to say it (def didn't, practiced my order in my head). I get up to the front, ready to pay. It's literally a $5 charge. Pretty sure they made me re-pay for the bagel AND the cream cheese. At this point, I don't even want the cold ah bagel because even though they charged my for a new one they didn't remake it. So now I'm waiting, watching them cream cheese the bagel that was here when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. The girl cheesing that bad boy literally body slams it into the counter on top of another customers bagel... Dude, I genuinely believed I was in the Truman Show cause ain't no way. A highlight was that she re-wrapped it at least so I took my man-handled bagel to my seat and sat and ate it. I just feel like the Peet's on this campus is a joke and the service should be a little better. If I'm going to pay $15 for a bagel and coffee, it should at least be done right and I shouldn't have to wait for the next Ice Age to get my order. This isn't something that's just happened to me either, my friends have similar stories if not worse. No hate to the workers though. ",4,1745973401.0,SBU,1,0.83,False

Since then, I have been on a pretty intense healing journey (both mind and body.) I have really worked with my nervous system to try to decrease the amount of cortisol I experience in a day. I also have adopted cycle syncing and have found so much success in it.  I have been (slowly) working on diet, definitely not as far along in this as I'd like but I'm getting there! This last month, I have also added in some naturopathic tinctures that have truly done WONDERS. I'm also doing trauma work and somatic work for the mental/emotional side of things. 

I have seen some really amazing results so far from all of these:  
Before my surgery, I was in excruciating pain 3 weeks out of the month, had very irregular cycles, hormonal acne, really bad migraines, extreme bloating, full body inflammation- basically it felt like my entire life was all pain and misery.

Now, I have pain 2-3 days during my period and around 2 days during ovulation. I have had 2-3 migraines over a 4 month period (longest I have EVER gone!) This last month, I had no hormonal acne! My bloating is still pretty intense, but it definitely has improved comparatively. My cycles are exactly 28 days and they have been very regular. My inflammation is still somewhat problematic, and I would like it to be better, but slow and steady has been the only way I've found success so far. 

I am about to start a second job, the job I have now is just a two day a week nannying job which is pretty easy and I'm able to do some practices during work, which has been very nice. I'm in a place where I need more money + I feel like I'm ready to work a more intensive job. It will be a barista position (I have always loved working in coffee) I'm hoping to expand my bandwidth for being on my feet and make some friends! However, I'm worried about working so many hours and being on my feet so much throughout the week. I still fear the misery that used to be my entire life. 

So, my question is, for those of you who work full time/more physically strenuous jobs, what are your self-care practices to stay ahead of flair-ups? What do you recommend building into my routine? I'm open to any advice/opinions/conversations! Thank you!! ",1,1745973292.0,endometriosis,2,1.0,False

1kb3hm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1kb3hm3/the_rains_embrace_a_cycle_of_drowning_shadows/,The Rain's Embrace: A Cycle of Drowning Shadows,"I still can‚Äôt believe she is gone. [My sister Laura, her friends, all drowned.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17o761o/i_still_hear_the_footsteps_in_the_rain/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) At least that was what we were told. We attended a funeral, but not all the bodies were recovered. Laura‚Äôs was gone but three of her friends were recovered. It gave some glimmer of hope that she was not dead, just missing. After a year though, it seemed unlikely she would be found. The area had been searched. We were told that divers went into the lake to try and find the missing ones, but no one could.

It was devastating for my family. But what I could not understand is what exactly happened. All we knew when she left was that Laura was going on a trip with her friends last year for spring break. It was a place in the mountains several hours away. The lake Kashur Resort and Spa. Apparently they had gone into the lake one night during a storm. They had allegedly been drunk and somehow each one of them had drowned. The proprietor of the place was unable to be reached for comment, but authorities said that all evidence pointed to a tragic accident.

Normally I would not have done anything but grieve for the loss of my sister, but then the letter arrived. It was from a man named Tim. He was the sole survivor of my sisters trip, he had an outlandish tale of impossible things that sounded like the delusional ravings of a person with survivors guilt.

The authorities' statement, predictably, clashed with his deranged ravings. They insisted it was a drunken swim party gone awry, resulting in an accidental death. But I never believed it, not about my sister. She was far too controlled to get intoxicated, and even if she had, she would never be so careless. Yet, the official investigation was stalled if not ended entirely.

The letter was genuinely disturbing, a cryptic tale from my sisters former friend,

""I can still hear their screams echoing in my mind. All of them. Adam and Gina were the first to fall, the splashing footsteps, swallowed by water, it was impossible. Yes, they drowned‚Ä¶but not in the lake. Laura, Becky, and I managed to reach the resort, the staff left us to fend for ourselves! Those things, the shapes, they followed us there.

They were in the rain, the lake, it was our fate, sealed and inescapable.

Forgive me, Becky, Laura. I tried, I really tried, but I was too late.

I am sending this to any of your family member who will listen.

I beg you, do not let them get away with this. They knew. They knew what would happen.""

It was the creeping madness of that letter that made it seem like a fever dream, or a drug-induced delusion. Yet something in Tim's words, the raw terror that bled through his scrawled handwriting, made my skin crawl with a truth I couldn't explain. I put the letter away and departed.

I struggled with the decision to reach out to the man to verify the details of his story. I had sent a letter hoping for a response, yet he remained silent, and I lacked his contact number. I learned he had relocated to Nevada, and the idea of traveling such a distance just to confront him felt overwhelming. His statements to the police seemed too outlandish to take seriously, yet part of me couldn‚Äôt shake the nagging curiosity about the truth behind his claims.

I had to know for sure, so I made the decision.

I would go to Lake Kashur and try and find my sister or at least say goodbye to her at the last place she was seen.

The trip took nearly seven hours, rain pelting my windshield most of the way. Though gloomy, the drive was not unpleasant and the area was admittedly beautiful. The further I drove, the more isolated the roads became, until I was winding through dense forest on a single-lane road that didn't appear on my GPS.

My phone disconnected and reconnected for the tenth time before losing the signal completely.

Just when I began to think I'd made a terrible mistake, the trees parted, revealing Lake Kashur Resort and Spa. It looked impressive, though unpopulated. The main building, a sprawling three-story lodge with weathered cedar siding, boasted against a backdrop of fog-shrouded mountains. Several smaller cabins dotted the shoreline, their windows dark and uninviting.

The lake itself stretched vast and resplendent, its surface rippling despite the absence of wind. Though it was impressive and serene, something in the shifting waters made my skin crawl.

A sign on the road indicated: ""Welcome to Lake Kashur - Where Memories Run Deep.""

Someone had scratched something beneath it, but it looked like a thin layer of slap dash paint had been applied over it, trying to cover whatever message someone had attempted to carve into the sign.

I parked in the nearly empty lot, only a resort truck and a few cars were there. Pulling my jacket tighter against the chill, I grabbed my bag and headed to the entrance as the skies darkened and thunder rumbled. Inside, the dim lobby was lit by antique fixtures casting long shadows across the polished floors, and I moved toward the reception desk.

A rustling sound came from behind the reception desk before a woman appeared, her movements so suddenly I nearly jumped.

""Welcome to Lake Kashur,"" she said. ""Do you have a reservation?""

""No, I was hoping to speak with someone about an accident that happened here last year.""

She studied me for an uncomfortably long moment. ""I am sorry we are not able to disclose details of any incidents that happened here to the press.""

""Well no, I am a relative. My name is Connor, I'm here because my sister stayed here last spring. Laura Hanson? She would have been in a larger group of people visiting for spring break. Could I check the guest book?""

Something flickered across her face.

""I'll need to get the manager,"" she said abruptly, reaching for a phone beneath the counter. She turned away slightly, her voice dropping to a whisper. ""Mr. Dalton? There's a young man asking about an incident. Yes, last spring."" She paused, listening. ""Yes, sir. Right away.""

She hung up and fixed that empty smile on me again. ""Mr. Dalton will be right with you. Please wait just a moment.""

Before I could respond, a tall figure emerged from a doorway I hadn't noticed before. He moved with unsettling grace for someone so gaunt, his impeccable suit hanging from his frame as if from a wire hanger.

""Gregory Dalton, proprietor of Lake Kashur Resort. I understand you have questions about your sister.""

He gestured toward a seating area away from the desk. ""Please, let's speak somewhere more comfortable.""

I followed him to a pair of leather chairs positioned near a window overlooking the lake. The rain had intensified, drops streaking the glass like tears.

""Laura Hanson,"" he said, folding his hands in his lap. ""Such a tragedy. I remember her vividly. Bright young woman. Studious. Not like the others in her group.""

The way he described her was uncannily accurate. I leaned forward. ""If I could be direct, what do you know about what really happened to her, Mr. Dalton? The official report says they drowned, but my sister was an excellent swimmer.""

Dalton's eyes flicked toward the sound before returning to me.

""Rules exist for a reason, Mr. Hanson. Sometimes tragic ones."" His voice lowered, almost hypnotic in its rhythm. ""Your sister and her friends were warned, as all our guests are, that swimming during rainfall is strictly prohibited at Lake Kashur. A liability issue, you understand.""

""That doesn't make sense. Why would rain make them drown? And if there was a rule, Laura wouldn't break it like that.""

""Peer pressure can be a powerful motivator, even for the most disciplined among us."" He sighed, a practiced sound of rehearsed regret. ""They were young. Exuberant. Perhaps they thought our warnings were superstitious, many do.""

I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the draft in the old building. ""What exactly are you saying happened?""

""They went swimming during a storm much like this one."" Dalton gestured toward the window. ""The lake can be unpredictable. Currents shift. Temperatures drop suddenly. People lose track of how far out they swim and then, well‚Ä¶By the time our staff realized what was happening, it was too late.""

The explanation, although hard to accept, was not entirely implausible. But still, something in his delivery felt hollow, like reciting lines from a well-rehearsed script. The pieces didn't fit. Tim's letter described something far more sinister than careless swimming.

Thunder echoed over the lake as Mr.Dalton glanced at the window. Rain poured down, churning the lake's surface. Before I could speak, Mr. Dalton interrupted,

""My sincerest condolences to you in this time of sorrow. Should you wish to remain with us for the night, I would be honored to have you stay. We have another group of young people here on break and you might enjoy their company. Besides, another tempest has arrived, and traveling amidst such torrential rain would be most perilous. Naturally, I shall provide full recompense for your night's stay, a mere token of solace in light of the profound loss of your dear sister.""

I hesitated, the conflicting information warring in my mind. I could investigate further if I stayed, maybe even find some evidence about what really happened to Laura. On the other hand, every instinct screamed that something was deeply wrong with this place.

""That's very generous,"" I said carefully. ""I think I will stay, just for the night, thank you.""

""Excellent,"" Dalton replied, his thin lips stretching into what might have been a smile. ""Room 217 should accommodate you nicely. It overlooks the lake and is close to‚Ä¶"" He stopped himself. ""Well, it has a splendid view.""

Close to where Laura went missing. He didn't need to finish, I knew that guarded look and it made me even more suspicious of just what they were hiding here.

The receptionist arrived with a brass key marked 217. ""Dinner is at seven,"" Dalton said, rising fluidly. ""Feel free to explore, but stay indoors and avoid the lake while it rains, for safety.""

""Of course,"" I agreed, accepting the key.

Dalton abruptly left, and a bellhop guided me to the second floor. The whole place had an eerie emptiness; only staff seemed to be lurking around.

The woman handed me the key and left without a word..

Inside, the room was tastefully furnished with slightly worn antique pieces, a queen bed, a writing desk by the window, and a newly renovated bathroom. The view, described as splendid, showed only a rain-beaten lake and a mist-obscured inlet. I wondered if that was where Laura went into the water?

I considered Tim's letter again. How he mentioned ""shapes in the rain"" and ""footsteps splashing on the ground."" At the time, I'd dismissed it as trauma-induced hallucinations, but now, staring at the churning lake, I wasn't so sure.

The rain intensified, drumming against the window with an almost deliberate rhythm. Thunder cracked overhead, and for a split second, I thought I saw something move beneath the lake's surface, a pale, elongated shape that wasn't there when I looked again.

The floor outside my room creaked. I froze and listened. Then I heard a shuffling sound, followed by what sounded like water dripping onto the carpet. Not the usual footsteps of someone passing by, but something different, heavier.

I crept to the door, pressing my ear against it. The dripping sound continued, followed by a strange, wet rasp like someone struggling to breathe through fluid. My hand trembled as I reached for the doorknob.

Suddenly a soft gurgling voice spoke to me, it sounded like a voice trying to speak underwater.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶need to leave. Not‚Ä¶safe, they come tonight, the sacrifice is prepared. They will awaken, and all must drown who still draw breath here‚Ä¶‚Äù

I was paralyzed with fear at the ominous warning and before I could turn the door handle and confront the mysterious voice, the sounds receded down the hallway, fading into silence. I exhaled shakily, backing away from the door. I had no idea what the hell was going on there.

I sat in confusion as a flash of lightning illuminated the room one final time,then nothing. The rain drumming on the window abruptly ceased. The sudden silence was almost more unnerving than the storm had been.

I approached the window cautiously. Outside, the transformation was startling. The lake had become a perfect mirror, reflecting the clearing sky with such precision it was difficult to discern where water ended and air began. Not a single ripple disturbed its glassy surface. The mist had vanished, revealing the entirety of the shoreline in crystalline detail.

I had heard enough, something was very wrong here and I knew it was a mistake to have come at all. I checked my phone and saw it was 6:45 PM. Dinner would be served soon, the distraction might offer some cover for getting out of there.

I slipped outside and rushed to the parking lot. To my horror I saw that all four tires of my car were now flat. Someone had deliberately slashed the tires, intending to strand me. 

My mind raced and despite my first instinct, I paused. I considered it must be Mr. Dalton, had he wanted to keep me here for whatever he was planning? I was alone and unarmed though, so I would not confront now, I just needed to leave. My heart pounded as I backed away from the car, considering the mile or two walk back to the highway. Just then, I heard laughter and chatter near the main building, the other guests Dalton mentioned. Relieved, I followed the voices to a courtyard, where five people in swimsuits stood with drinks in hand.

They were heading to the lake despite the approaching darkness and recent rain. I figured they might be able to help me get out of there, so I followed them and discovered a small cove, partially hidden by rocks, just as Tim described. A weathered wooden dock stretched twenty feet into the water. Had Laura stood here before she vanished?

As I moved toward the dock I saw the sign, bold red and indicating,

‚ÄúAbsolutely no swimming in the rain!‚Äù

They were very serious about that rule, and yet not much effort to enforce it if people just came out here and it started to rain.

The group of swimmers were making their way down the path toward the dock, their voices carrying clearly across the still night air.

""Dude, this place is amazing,"" one of the guys said, his arm slung around a girl's shoulders. ""Totally worth the price of this place.""

""I still can't believe we have the whole resort practically to ourselves,"" another girl replied, her blonde hair catching the moonlight.

""The old guy said swimming during bad weather is not recommended,"" one of the taller guys said, mimicking Dalton's formal cadence. ""But what he doesn't know won't hurt him.""

""I don't know, guys,"" a brunette girl hesitated, hugging herself. ""Did you see how he looked at us when Jake asked about swimming? It was creepy. For all we know they have hidden cameras or something.""

""Come on, Melissa,"" the guy with his arm around her urged. ""The rain stopped. It's perfect out. When will we ever get another chance like this? It's gorgeous out!""

The group stopped abruptly when they spotted me. An awkward silence fell over them.

""Hey creep what the hell?"" One of the guys called out. ""You work here or something?""

I realized they were talking to me as I was watching them from the tree line. I shook my head, stepping back toward the shore. ""No. Just a guest, like you.""

They visibly relaxed, though the brunette, Melissa still eyed me with suspicion.

""Sweet,"" said the guy who seemed to be the leader. ""We're just gonna take a quick dip. You won't tell the staff, right?""

I hesitated. These were just college kids looking to have fun, exactly like Laura and her friends had been.

""I don't think that's a good idea,"" I said, surprising myself with the firmness in my voice. ""There was an accident here last year. People died. Listen, I think we need to leave, there‚Äôs something wrong with the people who work here, something‚Äôs off. Someone slashed my tires and I heard something about a sacrifice.""

The group exchanged glances. After a pause, several of them burst into laughter.

""A sacrifice? Seriously? Did the old man put you up to this? What's next, a hook-handed killer who preys on couples making out?""

""I'm serious,"" I insisted, stepping closer. ""My sister was here last year. She drowned in this lake with her friends. The only survivor sent me a letter about things in the lake that came out when it rained. Please, just listen to me.""

My desperation must have shown through because some of their smiles faltered. Melissa bit her lip. ""Maybe we should go back. I didn't like the vibe of this place anyway.""

""Oh come on!"" the other girl exclaimed. ""We paid good money for this weekend. I'm not letting some random dude with a sob story ruin it.""

""Look, I'm not trying to scare you,"" I said. ""But something's not right here. The manager, the staff, they're hiding something. And my tires‚Ä¶""

""Your tires probably got punctured on the crappy road getting here,"" Jake interrupted. ""Happens all the time in these backwoods places.""

Thunder rumbled in the distance, a sound that made my blood run cold despite the clear sky above us.

""Weather's turning again,"" the tall guy noted, glancing at the horizon where dark clouds were gathering with unnatural speed. ""Maybe we should head in, just for a bit.""

Jake shook his head stubbornly. ""One quick dip. We'll be back before the rain hits.""

Before I could protest further, he was sprinting down the dock, the others following with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Jake dove in with a splash, followed by two others. Melissa and the tall guy hung back, watching from the edge.

""Come on, it feels amazing!"" Jake called, treading water.

I took a step back as The sky darkened with impossible speed. One moment clear, the next churning with black clouds. The distant thunder wasn't distant anymore, it cracked directly overhead, making the dock vibrate beneath my feet. The first drops fell,

""Jake, seriously, let's go!"" Melissa called, backing away from the edge. But something was happening to the lake. Where it had been glass-smooth moments before, now the surface rippled oddly, not from the rain or the swimmers, but from below. Concentric circles formed around the three in the water, as if something was rising toward them.

""You guys need to get out now!"" I yelled.

They reached the shore and were panting, but all okay apparently. They looked to each other and then the lake and started laughing.

‚ÄúAh man, nothing happened. Thought the Loch Ness Monster would come out to play or something with all the build up.‚Äù They continued laughing with only the girl named Melissa grimacing and looking around nervously. I watched the lake as the rain intensified and was disturbed by how the water began to roil, less like a lake more like an angry ocean.

The lake's surface began to churn violently, waves forming where there had been none before. The rain suddenly intensified, shifting from a gentle patter to a downpour in seconds.

A light in the distance cut through the darkness from somewhere behind me, sweeping across the shoreline. I raised my hand to shield my eyes as the powerful beam briefly illuminated me, casting my shadow long and distorted across the lake. The light was impossibly bright, like a searchlight but stronger, scanning methodically across the water's surface. Two sharp, piercing whistles sliced through the air, mechanical, like an old steam engine announcing its arrival. The sound echoed across the lake, reverberating in my chest.

""What the hell is that?"" one of the guys shouted, pointing toward the source of the light.

I turned to look, but the beam had already moved on, now sweeping across the turbulent surface of the lake. In its path, I could see something disturbing the water, not waves, but shapes moving beneath the surface, pale and elongated.

The group scrambled away from the shore, grabbing their belongings in a hurry. Through the increasing downpour, I noticed movement on the resort's main driveway, headlights cutting through the rain as several vehicles pulled away from the lodge, fleeing in haste.

""They're leaving us,"" I whispered, a cold dread settling in my stomach. ""The staff is evacuating, they know something is going to happen."" I considered the mysterious words about a sacrifice and my heart sank.

Before anyone could process what was happening, a red pickup truck with flashing emergency lights lurched down the path toward our position, its tires spraying mud and gravel. It skidded to a halt at the edge of the cove, and the driver's door swung open.

Mr. Dalton emerged, no longer the composed proprietor but a man possessed. His thin hair was plastered to his skull, his expensive suit soaked through. In his hand was something that looked like an antique lantern, its blue flame impossibly bright despite the rain.

""It happens faster every year, as if your cohort becomes increasingly less intelligent,"" he sneered with a chilling chuckle. ""Simple rules for simple minds. Honestly, if we made a rule stating that you would die if you didn't swim in the rain, your contrarian nature would probably guarantee that the Drowned ones would never wake again. Yet, here we find ourselves."" His eyes glinted with a sinister amusement as he sighed deeply, ""I fear you're all fresh out of luck.""

I couldn't process his words at first, they were too crazy, too detached from reality. But the cold calculation in his eyes told me this wasn't madness. It was something worse.

""What do you mean 'fresh out of luck'?"" the group's leader Jake demanded, stepping forward. ""What the hell is going on?""

Dalton ignored the chaos, focusing on me. ""You should've stayed in your room, Mr. Hanson. The lake is off-limits during rain, as I warned. Now you'll see what happened to your sister. The cycle continues. The lake must be fed. Die well."" With that, the truck sped off.

Terrible splashing footsteps echoed on the ground by the shore, like something heavy emerging, yet nothing was visible. Everyone froze in fear. Suddenly, a scream pierced the night, cut short as a girl was dragged across the wet ground, clawing at the earth. An unseen force, rain turned solid, pulled her toward the water.

""Help me!"" she cried, terror in her voice. Two men lunged, grabbing her wrists, forming a grim tug-of-war against the invisible pull.

""Don't let go!"" she sobbed, her eyes wild with fear.

But something was wrong with the rain where it touched her skin. It wasn't running off but collecting, thickening, taking form. Pale, elongated fingers materialized from the raindrops themselves, clutching at her legs, her waist, multiplying with each passing second.

Soon her scream was smothered by a rush of water forming from nothing over her head, drowning her on the edge of the water.

In the next moment the girl's body was pulled free from her attempted rescuers and she was yanked backward with impossible force. She didn't even have time to scream again before she was submerged, the lake swallowing her whole without a splash, as if she'd never existed at all.

""Jenny!"" her friends screamed in unison.

The remaining swimmers stood on the shore, their panicked screams barely audible over the hammering rain. I stood frozen, processing the horror of the situation. This was what happened to my sister. It wasn't an accident. It was a sacrifice.

""Run!"" I shouted to the others, finally breaking free of my paralysis. ""Get away from the water!""

But it was too late. The rain itself seemed to come alive, droplets coalescing mid-air into translucent shapes. One man was pulled off his feet by invisible forces, dragged through the mud as he screamed and clawed at the earth. Clinging to a tree trunk, his grip failed as rain shaped into fingers pried him loose.

""We have to get to the lodge!"" I yelled.

We sprinted through the rain, surrounded by translucent figures with featureless faces, water streaming from their elongated limbs as they moved toward us unnaturally. The lodge loomed ahead, dark and imposing against the storm-wracked sky. The front entrance stood partially open, swinging lazily in the wind. Not a single light burned inside.

""They're gone,"" the tall guy panted as we raced up the steps. ""Everyone's gone.""

We burst through the doors into the cavernous lobby. The reception desk was abandoned, drawers hanging open as if someone had left in a hurry. The elegant furniture that had seemed so welcoming earlier now cast grotesque shadows in the dim emergency lighting.

""We need to barricade the doors,"" I gasped, already shoving a heavy armchair toward the entrance. Melissa and the tall guy joined me, dragging a coffee table and an antique bench to block the way.

""I've got my car,"" Jake said suddenly, fumbling for his keys. ""It's right out front. If I can get to it, we can drive out of here!"" His eyes were wild with a desperate hope. ""I'll bring it around to the door. Be ready to jump in!""

Before I could stop him, he bolted toward a side exit, keys clutched in his trembling hand.

""Wait!"" I called after him, but he was already gone, the door slamming shut behind him.

Melissa and I pressed our faces to the window, watching as he sprinted through the downpour toward a blue sedan parked near the front steps. Splashing footsteps in the rain were appearing all around the building and parking lot with each passing second.

""Come on, come on,"" Melissa whispered, her breath fogging the glass.

The rain intensified and it became difficult to see anything outside. We pressed our ears to the glass and then recoiled when a disturbing scratching sound was heard on the other side of the door. It was followed by a voice out of a nightmare,

""Please... let us in,"" came a wet, gurgling voice from the other side of the door. The sound was unmistakably human yet horribly distorted, as if the speaker's lungs were filled with fluid. ""It's me... Jenny. I'm so cold... I can't breathe out here.""

Melissa stumbled backward, her hand flying to her mouth. ""That's her voice,"" she whispered. ""Oh God, that's Jenny's voice.""

""Help me,"" the voice pleaded, higher now, desperate. ""I'm drowning... please... it hurts so much.""

Water began seeping under the door, not in the usual way rain might trickle in, but purposefully, gathering into a puddle that crept across the floor toward us.

""Don't listen,"" I hissed, pulling Melissa farther back. ""That's not Jenny. Your friend is gone.""

A second voice joined the first, this one deeper but equally waterlogged. ""Sam... please... open the door. I can't... hold on much longer."" The voice choked and sputtered. ""The water... it's filling my lungs.""

""Matt?"" Melissa whispered, her face ashen. She took an involuntary step forward before I grabbed her arm.

""It's not them,"" I insisted, though my voice trembled. ""It's whatever took them. The same thing that took my sister.""

The frantic scratching grew louder against the walls and door. Tears streamed down Melisa's cheeks as she sobbed into her hands. Beside her, Sam gently comforted her with a soothing voice and embrace. Distracted by the unearthly voices pleading to be let in, we missed what was happening outside. Jake reached his car, the engine roared, and headlights pierced the darkness as he reversed.

For a moment, hope surged within me. The sedan backed up rapidly, aiming for the lodge entrance. If he could get close enough, we could make a run for it.

But something was wrong. The car was moving too fast, careening backward at a speed that suggested panic rather than control. Through the rain-streaked windshield, I could see the Jake was wrestling with the steering wheel, his face contorted in terror.

""Something's in there with him,"" I realized aloud, just as the sedan crashed through the barricade we'd erected, splintering the wooden barricade and shattering the lobby doors. Glass and splinters exploded across the marble floor as the vehicle smashed halfway into the building before grinding to a halt, its rear wheels still spinning.

""Jake!"" Melissa screamed, but her voice died in her throat as we saw what was happening inside the car.

The interior was filled with water, impossibly contained within the vehicle like an aquarium. Jake thrashed within, his mouth open in a silent scream, bubbles escaping his lips as he pounded against the windows. His eyes bulged, pleading for help we couldn't provide.

And then I saw them, the pale, elongated figures sharing the flooded car with him, their translucent hands wrapped around his throat, his ankles, his wrists. One of them turned toward us, a faceless head composed entirely of water, and I swear I saw a smile ripple across its featureless visage.

But worse than the horror inside the car was what was happening behind it. The rain creatures were flowing in through the shattered entrance, seeping around the sedan's frame and reforming inside the lobby. They moved with terrible purpose, water flowing upward against gravity to shape humanoid figures with long, reaching arms.

""Upstairs!"" I grabbed Melissa and Sam, yanking them toward the grand staircase. ""We need to get higher!""

We frantically clambered up the steps, the relentless splashing footsteps echoing behind us with a chilling consistency, never hastening or faltering, as inevitable and inescapable as death itself.

We reached the second floor landing, gasping for breath. The hallway stretched before us, doors lining both sides. Some stood ajar, inviting us into their deceptive safety.

""My room,"" I panted, pointing down the corridor. ""217. We can barricade ourselves in there.""

A flash of lightning illuminated the hallway through a large window at the end of the corridor. To my horror, the window was wide open, rain pouring in freely. The water wasn't behaving naturally , instead of simply splashing onto the floor, it gathered in midair, coalescing into those same terrible forms we'd seen outside.

""They're already inside,"" Melissa whispered, her voice breaking.

We looked behind us to see more water creatures ascending the stairs, their movements fluid yet somehow wrong, like stop-motion animation played at the wrong speed.

""Run!"" I shouted, pulling Melissa toward my room. Sam sprinted ahead of us, but as we passed the open window, a watery tendril shot out, wrapping around his ankle. He stumbled, crashing to the carpet.

""Help!"" he screamed, fingers clawing at the hallway runner as the tendril began dragging him back toward the window. I lunged for his outstretched hand, our fingers brushing for a split second before he was yanked away with impossible force.

""Sam!"" Melissa shrieked as he was pulled toward the open window, more tendrils materializing from the rain to envelop his body. His scream transformed into a choking gurgle as his head disappeared beneath the watery surface.

""We can't help him!"" I shouted, watching in horror as Sam's struggling form was enveloped in water that seemed to materialize from nowhere, covering him.

We made it to her room and slammed and locked the door. I ensured the windows were closed and barricaded the door. We sat in terrified silence as the horrifying sounds of the things outside pressed inwards.

Melissa collapsed onto the floor, trembling and sobbing uncontrollably as the reality of what had happened to her friends sank in. I checked the bathroom for any water source, relieved to find the taps dry when I turned them. Small mercies.

""What are those things?"" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the pounding rain outside. ""This can't be happening.""

The scratching began at our door, soft at first, then more insistent. Water seeped beneath the doorframe, forming a small puddle that began to grow despite our attempts to block it with towels.

The voices called, a horrible chorus of drowned friends. ""We found something amazing in the lake. You have to see it. Please let us in.""

Melissa pressed her hands over her ears, rocking back and forth. ""Make it stop,"" she begged. ""Please make it stop.""

We waited, helpless in the room for what felt like hours. None of the things got in, but we could not get out. Then the sound of the rain stopped. The ghoulish voices begging us to let them in stopped as well.

It was the rain! I remembered what the letter said, they came with the rain. We had to take our chance and leave now.

""We're leaving,"" I said, my voice stronger than I felt. ""Now.""

Melissa looked up at me with red-rimmed eyes. ""But what if they're waiting? What if...""

""If we stay here, we die,"" I cut her off, gripping her shoulders. ""The rain's stopped. Those things... they come with the rain. That's what happened to my sister.""

I moved to the window and peered outside. The storm had broken The lake gleamed under the dull shades of the coming dawn.

""We need to get to a car,"" I said. ""Any car.""

""Jake's is still downstairs,"" Melissa whispered, pushing herself to her feet. Her face was pale but determined.

We crept to the door, listening for any sounds beyond. Nothing but silence greeted us. I turned the handle slowly, wincing at the slight creak as the door swung open. The hallway was empty. Not just of water creatures, but of any trace they'd been there at all.

We moved cautiously down the stairwell.

""I don't understand,"" Melissa whispered as we reached the first floor. ""How can everything be normal?""

The lobby told a different story. Jake's car remained half-embedded in the shattered entrance, a grim reminder that not everything had been reset. But the vehicle was empty, no water, no Jake, just the keys still dangling from the ignition.

""Let's go,"" I said, moving toward the car.

Melissa hesitated. ""Shouldn't we look for the others? Maybe they're still alive somewhere.""

I shook my head, remembering Laura, remembering Tim's letter. ""They're gone. If we stay, we'll be gone too.""

The car's engine sputtered to life on the first try. I reversed it carefully over the broken glass and splintered wood. As we pulled away from the lodge, I glanced in the rearview mirror. The building loomed dark and silent, its windows reflecting the faint light of the rising sun like empty eyes. We drove down the winding road through the forest, both too traumatized to speak at first.

""I'm so sorry about your sister,"" Melissa finally said, her voice small in the confined space

I nodded absently, my knuckles white on the steering wheel. ""I just wish I knew what really happened to her. If those things took her like they took your friends.""

The words died in my throat as a single drop of water hit the windshield. Then another. And another.

""No,"" Melissa whispered, her eyes widening in terror. ""Not again.""

Rain began to pelt the car, increasing in intensity with unnatural speed. I pressed my foot to the accelerator, the sedan lurching forward on the narrow road.

""Faster!"" Melissa urged, twisting in her seat to look behind us.

I heard it then, the unmistakable sound of splashing footsteps keeping pace with the car. Not on the road, but somehow beside us, within the curtain of rain itself.

""Connor‚Ä¶""

My blood froze. It was Laura's voice, clear as day, coming from just outside my window.

""Connor, why are you leaving me?"" The voice was perfectly my sister's, yet horribly distorted, as if she were speaking through water. ""I've been so alone.""

""Don't listen,"" Melissa warned, her hands pressed against her ears. ""It's not her.""

But I couldn't help myself. I glanced toward my window and saw a pale face formed in the rain, Laura's face, her features rippling and flowing but unmistakably hers. Water streamed from her hair, her eyes, her mouth as she clung to the car, impossible yet undeniable.

""Please, Connor‚Ä¶I'm drowning‚Ä¶help me."" Her watery fingers pressed against the glass, leaving no marks yet somehow I could feel the chill of her touch through the window.

I swerved, nearly sending us off the road. The tires skidded on the wet asphalt as I struggled to keep control.

""Don't look at it!"" Melissa screamed, but her eyes were fixed on her own window where Matt's face had formed in the rain, his features twisted in agony.

The windshield wipers worked frantically, slicing through the apparitions only for them to reform instantly. Laura's voice grew more desperate, more insistent.

""You promised you'd always protect me‚Ä¶why did you leave me here? I'm so cold‚Ä¶so dark under the water.""

My chest constricted with grief and guilt. ""I'm sorry,"" I whispered, tears blurring my vision. ""I'm so sorry, Laura.""

""Pull over,"" her voice coaxed, sweet and terrible. ""Just stop the car. Let me in. We can be together again.""

For a heartbeat, my foot hovered over the brake pedal. The longing to see my sister again, to speak with her one last time, was overwhelming.

""Connor, don't!"" Melissa's hand clamped down on my arm. ""It's not her! Remember what happened to the others!""

The spell broke. I stomped on the accelerator and eventually the voices receded as well as the rain.

My sister was gone, what was left there was not her. Melissa and I made our way back to what we believed was safety, but I recalled Tim and his survival and realized we would never really be safe again. Those creatures had marked us, and they would relentlessly pursue us. The rain, once a simple part of nature, had transformed into a constant harbinger of our impending doom.



That was all two months ago. Melissa and I stayed in touch after our escape from Lake Kashur, bound by a trauma no one else could understand. The official report blamed a flash flood that claimed her friends, another tragic accident like Laura‚Äôs.

I tried to explain what really happened, rain forming into people, drowned voices, and a proprietor who fled, leaving his guests as sacrifices, but it sounded insane. They offered grief counseling and quietly closed the case.

I‚Äôve spent hours researching Lake Kashur. Ownership records reveal a history of ‚Äútragic accidents,‚Äù yet Gregory Dalton‚Äôs name is missing, as if he never existed. The most disturbing find was a 1937 newspaper clipping showing Dalton at the resort‚Äôs opening ceremony, unchanged by time, looking exactly like he did when I saw him in person.

I had no idea who or what he really is and I don‚Äôt know if I will ever know.

Tonight, it is raining again. Even with the blinds drawn, I hear the voices, splashing footsteps, and fingernails scratching at the glass. Melissa calls these episodes ‚Äúhauntings‚Äù, fitting since the dead spirits will never give us peace.

Now, as the relentless rain pounds on every sealed entry, my phone buzzes. Melissa whispers, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre outside my building, I can hear them calling, Matt, Jenny, everyone.‚Äù I tell her to stay put and follow our safety plan. Even so, the hauntings grow more relentless, and I fear I may not last much longer. I fear I will never be free, from this drowning cycle of death.",1,1745973036.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

**Chapter 1: The First Wish**

When Alex was in third grade, he met Sophie. She had two ponytails, scraped knees, and could run faster than any of the boys on the playground‚Äîincluding him.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre slow,‚Äù she grinned one afternoon after outrunning him in a race across the soccer field.

‚ÄúYou cheated!‚Äù Alex huffed, but he was already smiling.

They became inseparable after that. Alex would bring two juice boxes every day‚Äîone for him, one for Sophie. Sophie would always save the last cookie in her lunchbox for Alex, even though chocolate chip was her favorite. They climbed jungle gyms, told secrets behind the library, and swore they‚Äôd always be friends.

By fifth grade, Alex noticed something. Sophie was taller. Not just by a little. By a lot.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm shrinking,‚Äù he joked one day.

Sophie leaned down slightly and grinned. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll carry you if you get too small.‚Äù

Alex laughed, but something fluttered in his chest when she said it. He didn‚Äôt know what it was yet‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt the cookies.

**Chapter 2: Shrinking, But Still Mine**

As the years passed, something strange began to happen. By the time they entered high school, Alex started to shrink. It wasn‚Äôt a literal shrinking, but in comparison to Sophie, he was now shorter. Much shorter.

She had grown so much over the summer that, when they stood side by side, she was several inches taller than him. And Alex could feel it. He felt smaller, less important somehow, and his shoulders drooped as he tried to catch up with her.

But Sophie never let him feel small. She‚Äôd lean down and pat his head, calling him ""her little giant.""

One evening, as they sat on the swings, Sophie spoke quietly, ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre both changing. And that‚Äôs okay, right?‚Äù

Alex turned to her, his heart aching. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Sophie. You‚Äôve grown so much. I‚Äôm just... shrinking.‚Äù

She smiled, brushing a strand of hair out of his eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not shrinking, Alex. You‚Äôre just... growing in other ways. And no matter how much we change, I‚Äôll always be here for you.‚Äù

And with that, Alex knew. No matter how much taller she got, or how much smaller he seemed, Sophie was right. The real growth was happening inside them both.

**Chapter 3: Grown in Love**

The strange thing about love was that, while Alex‚Äôs body was shrinking, something inside him was growing‚Äîhis love for Sophie.

One morning, Alex woke up and realized something. He had stopped measuring himself against Sophie‚Äôs height. No longer did he stand beside her, gazing up at her, feeling disappointed by how much taller she was. Instead, he looked at her, really looked at her‚Äîand saw the beautiful woman she was becoming.

Sophie was no longer just his childhood friend. She was everything. And Alex‚Äôs love for her had grown in ways he couldn‚Äôt explain. It wasn‚Äôt about her height. It wasn‚Äôt about what they could do for each other. It was simply that he loved her, completely, with every part of himself.

‚ÄúI love you, Sophie,‚Äù he whispered one evening, their hands entwined.

Sophie‚Äôs eyes softened. She leaned down, bringing her face close to his. ‚ÄúI love you too, Alex. I‚Äôve always loved you.‚Äù

Alex‚Äôs heart swelled with emotion. ‚ÄúEven when I was taller than you?‚Äù

She chuckled softly. ‚ÄúEven then.‚Äù

**Chapter 4: What Love Looks Like**

Years passed, and Alex and Sophie graduated high school. But their love didn‚Äôt change. In fact, it only grew. They had both changed so much‚ÄîAlex had grown taller again, but it wasn‚Äôt his height that made him feel like a man. It was the love he felt for Sophie, the woman who had always been by his side, even when the world seemed to shift and change around them.

One evening, as they walked home together, Sophie squeezed his hand. ‚ÄúAlex, how did we get here?‚Äù

Alex smiled softly. ‚ÄúWe grew, Soph. Not just in height, but in love.‚Äù

Sophie‚Äôs eyes glistened with unshed tears. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. I always thought I had to be strong, that I had to carry you. But it turns out, we carry each other.‚Äù

**Chapter 5: The Space Between**

Alex and Sophie moved into a small apartment together after graduating from college. The transition into adulthood felt strange, but as long as they had each other, they knew they‚Äôd be okay. They took turns making dinner, cleaned together, and always found time to laugh‚Äîeven when the days were long.

They had their disagreements, as all couples did. There were times when Alex felt unsure about his place in the world, and Sophie would be there to remind him of his worth. Likewise, Sophie would have moments of doubt, but Alex would always be by her side to reassure her.

Late one night, as they sat together, Sophie sighed. ‚ÄúSometimes I wonder if we‚Äôre doing enough. If we‚Äôre enough.‚Äù

Alex looked at her, his heart full. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre everything I‚Äôve ever wanted, Sophie. Just you being here with me is enough.‚Äù

Her eyes softened, and she leaned in to kiss him. In that moment, everything felt complete‚Äîjust like it always had, from their days of childhood friendship, to the years of growing together.

**Chapter 6: Growing Old Together**

Years passed in what felt like the blink of an eye. They celebrated their wedding day, then the arrival of their first child, a daughter they named Mira. Watching their daughter grow was both a joy and a bittersweet reminder of their own aging process.

But even as their bodies grew older, even as gray streaked through their hair and wrinkles crept into their smiles, the love they shared never faltered. They held hands in the mornings over coffee, danced together on quiet nights, and cherished every moment of their lives together.

One evening, while sitting on their porch and watching the sunset, Alex took Sophie‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve lived a good life, haven‚Äôt we?‚Äù

Sophie nodded, resting her head on his shoulder. ‚ÄúThe best life.‚Äù

**Chapter 7: The Last Dance**

Alex and Sophie were now well into their seventies. Their steps had slowed, their backs were a little hunched, but their love was as strong as ever. They still walked hand in hand, their fingers intertwined, and they still found comfort in the little things‚Äîlike the way Sophie made Alex his morning coffee, just how he liked it, or how Alex would fix Sophie‚Äôs hair whenever it got tangled.

One night, as they lay in bed, Sophie looked up at him with a gentle smile. ‚ÄúAlex, remember when we were kids? When we thought we‚Äôd never change?‚Äù

Alex smiled back, his eyes soft. ‚ÄúI remember. But the truth is, I‚Äôm glad we changed. We grew, Sophie. We grew together.‚Äù

Sophie squeezed his hand. ‚ÄúAnd I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted it any other way.‚Äù

**Chapter 8: Holding Hands Forever**

The day came quietly, like the falling of autumn leaves. Alex and Sophie had spent their last morning together, sipping tea on their porch, watching the world go by. They had no more words to say‚Äîonly the steady rhythm of their hearts, beating in unison.

That afternoon, as the sun set behind them, Alex and Sophie closed their eyes for the last time, still holding hands. Together, they passed away, as they had lived: side by side.

**Epilogue: A Love That Never Ends**

Years later, their daughter Mira would tell her children about her parents‚Äîtheir love, their laughter, and their unshakable bond. She would tell them how her parents had defied time, how they had faced each change with courage and love, and how they had shown her what it truly meant to grow with someone, through every season of life.

And even though Alex and Sophie were no longer physically with them, their love lived on in every corner of the family, a testament to a love that never faded, never shrank, and never stopped growing.

She had grown so much over the summer that, when they stood side by side, she was several inches taller than him. And Alex could feel it. He felt smaller, less important somehow, and his shoulders drooped as he tried to catch up with her.

But Sophie never let him feel small. She‚Äôd lean down and pat his head, calling him ""her little giant.""

One evening, as they sat on the swings, Sophie spoke quietly, ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre both changing. And that‚Äôs okay, right?‚Äù

Alex turned to her, his heart aching. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Sophie. You‚Äôve grown so much. I‚Äôm just... shrinking.‚Äù

She smiled, brushing a strand of hair out of his eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not shrinking, Alex. You‚Äôre just... growing in other ways. And no matter how much we change, I‚Äôll always be here for you.‚Äù

And with that, Alex knew. No matter how much taller she got, or how much smaller he seemed, Sophie was right. The real growth was happening inside them both.

**Chapter 3: Grown in Love**

The strange thing about love was that, while Alex‚Äôs body was shrinking, something inside him was growing‚Äîhis love for Sophie.

One morning, Alex woke up and realized something. He had stopped measuring himself against Sophie‚Äôs height. No longer did he stand beside her, gazing up at her, feeling disappointed by how much taller she was. Instead, he looked at her, really looked at her‚Äîand saw the beautiful woman she was becoming.

Sophie was no longer just his childhood friend. She was everything. And Alex‚Äôs love for her had grown in ways he couldn‚Äôt explain. It wasn‚Äôt about her height. It wasn‚Äôt about what they could do for each other. It was simply that he loved her, completely, with every part of himself.

‚ÄúI love you, Sophie,‚Äù he whispered one evening, their hands entwined.

Sophie‚Äôs eyes softened. She leaned down, bringing her face close to his. ‚ÄúI love you too, Alex. I‚Äôve always loved you.‚Äù

Alex‚Äôs heart swelled with emotion. ‚ÄúEven when I was taller than you?‚Äù

She chuckled softly. ‚ÄúEven then.‚Äù

**Chapter 4: What Love Looks Like**

Years passed, and Alex and Sophie graduated high school. But their love didn‚Äôt change. In fact, it only grew. They had both changed so much‚ÄîAlex had grown taller again, but it wasn‚Äôt his height that made him feel like a man. It was the love he felt for Sophie, the woman who had always been by his side, even when the world seemed to shift and change around them.

One evening, as they walked home together, Sophie squeezed his hand. ‚ÄúAlex, how did we get here?‚Äù

Alex smiled softly. ‚ÄúWe grew, Soph. Not just in height, but in love.‚Äù

Sophie‚Äôs eyes glistened with unshed tears. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. I always thought I had to be strong, that I had to carry you. But it turns out, we carry each other.‚Äù

**Chapter 5: The Space Between**

Alex and Sophie moved into a small apartment together after graduating from college. The transition into adulthood felt strange, but as long as they had each other, they knew they‚Äôd be okay. They took turns making dinner, cleaned together, and always found time to laugh‚Äîeven when the days were long.

They had their disagreements, as all couples did. There were times when Alex felt unsure about his place in the world, and Sophie would be there to remind him of his worth. Likewise, Sophie would have moments of doubt, but Alex would always be by her side to reassure her.

Late one night, as they sat together, Sophie sighed. ‚ÄúSometimes I wonder if we‚Äôre doing enough. If we‚Äôre enough.‚Äù

Alex looked at her, his heart full. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre everything I‚Äôve ever wanted, Sophie. Just you being here with me is enough.‚Äù

Her eyes softened, and she leaned in to kiss him. In that moment, everything felt complete‚Äîjust like it always had, from their days of childhood friendship, to the years of growing together.

**Chapter 6: Growing Old Together**

Years passed in what felt like the blink of an eye. They celebrated their wedding day, then the arrival of their first child, a daughter they named Mira. Watching their daughter grow was both a joy and a bittersweet reminder of their own aging process.

But even as their bodies grew older, even as gray streaked through their hair and wrinkles crept into their smiles, the love they shared never faltered. They held hands in the mornings over coffee, danced together on quiet nights, and cherished every moment of their lives together.

One evening, while sitting on their porch and watching the sunset, Alex took Sophie‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve lived a good life, haven‚Äôt we?‚Äù

Sophie nodded, resting her head on his shoulder. ‚ÄúThe best life.‚Äù

**Chapter 7: The Last Dance**

Alex and Sophie were now well into their seventies. Their steps had slowed, their backs were a little hunched, but their love was as strong as ever. They still walked hand in hand, their fingers intertwined, and they still found comfort in the little things‚Äîlike the way Sophie made Alex his morning coffee, just how he liked it, or how Alex would fix Sophie‚Äôs hair whenever it got tangled.

One night, as they lay in bed, Sophie looked up at him with a gentle smile. ‚ÄúAlex, remember when we were kids? When we thought we‚Äôd never change?‚Äù

Alex smiled back, his eyes soft. ‚ÄúI remember. But the truth is, I‚Äôm glad we changed. We grew, Sophie. We grew together.‚Äù

Sophie squeezed his hand. ‚ÄúAnd I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted it any other way.‚Äù

**Chapter 8: Holding Hands Forever**

The day came quietly, like the falling of autumn leaves. Alex and Sophie had spent their last morning together, sipping tea on their porch, watching the world go by. They had no more words to say‚Äîonly the steady rhythm of their hearts, beating in unison.

That afternoon, as the sun set behind them, Alex and Sophie closed their eyes for the last time, still holding hands. Together, they passed away, as they had lived: side by side.

**Epilogue: A Love That Never Ends**

Years later, their daughter Mira would tell her children about her parents‚Äîtheir love, their laughter, and their unshakable bond. She would tell them how her parents had defied time, how they had faced each change with courage and love, and how they had shown her what it truly meant to grow with someone, through every season of life.

And even though Alex and Sophie were no longer physically with them, their love lived on in every corner of the family, a testament to a love that never faded, never shrank, and never stopped growing.

I am a junior developer working on a social media app. I wanted to do some recon to see what this thread thinks of a social media app focused on giving random acts of kindness...

The crux of the idea is you can offer or request a random act of kindness, you can do this anonymously. You can post to just your friends or the public, and these can be any kind of 'random act of kindness' it can be advice, $5 for a coffee, giving away something or whatever.

It would be gamified so you level up based on the amount of random act of kindness you do... would love you thoughts, I have had mixed feedback and want to know if I should keep building out a MVP.

I'm going through a thing lol and need advice. Firstly about me: I'm mid thirties and had been in the same hetero relationship/marriage since I was 18. The marriage has since ended pretty recently (still going through the legal stuff). My whole life I've always been straight passing and identified as straight, but I've always been bisexual. After a lot of therapy to deal with internalized homophobia I came out to my spouse who angrily outed me to my mother (who openly accepts me as I am). The only other people I'm out to is one of my siblings (who's been out for about 10 years) and my best friend from work.

The advice I need is this: I have 2 other siblings (sisters) that I am extremely close to. I've been working up the courage to come out to them and I'm ready to, but I just haven't figured out how to. I know they will accept me and love me regardless

To throw another wrench in the gear, my spouse had tried to start a triad with a partner of my same gender, but wound up unicorn hunting. And hurting them. I stayed friends with said unicorn. After the explosive end of my marriage I've started seeing the other partner and found that spark burning brighter than before. I genuinely feel for this person in a way I haven't felt since I was a teenager.

What I'm trying to figure out is should I come out with a bang and throw a big party, or should I be gentle and kind like no big deal over coffee. My siblings are very kind and are allies to the LGBTQ+ community.

Last thing (unless I overthink something else): I want to start introducing my partner to my family and have considered bringing them for emotional support when I do come out.

I am looking to make new friends and also open to dating. I know this might sound silly but how do men feel when a women approaches them? I have never done that before.

Asking out for coffee or striking a normal conversation and try to be friendly, women asking for number to stay in touch?

Many times i see men and just feel like i should initiate but on second thought i stop -thinking they might think im weird, desperate or something lol.

I want to know as a man how would you feel if a women approaches you. What would you perceive generally? Is there any specific way/thing i should keep in mind before doing or im just overthinking?


EDIT: Did not mention looks to keep it neutral but since i see a lot of comments are based on that. In short I‚Äôd say I look way above average with a pretty good physique since im very particular about my diet and health. I always get compliments that I look cute and way younger than my age.

1kb39bl,https://i.redd.it/e2szhum78vxe1.jpeg,Advice for anxious dog that has regressed to destructive behavior,"Hello all. 

Looking for any advice or success stories from those who have managed dogs with mild to severe anxiety. 

I adopted my big man about 2.5 years ago. He had been at the pound for five months at that point and the staff claimed he had been seen by three behaviorists who said he was a majorly anxious dog and would require anxiety meds (I addressed this with his vet at his neutering and they dismissed it). As far as we know he was a stray for the first year and two months before they got him. Initially he was very obviously stressed out: very fearful of all humans (still is to some extent but we have made major strides there), a successful escape from home (he came back), and many many many shredded beds, toys, blankets, hoodies, and various objects of my possession. We did crate training for about 8 months and he did very well. It took a couple months for us to catch a rhythm with each other and him to learn the schedule but once he did the destruction stopped. I was able to train him out of the crate and to be calm while I was away at work. He did not see the inside of his crate for over a year and was perfect! 

Maybe three months ago now the destruction started again out of nowhere. No change in the home, diet, my schedule, health issues, etc. I normally work 7am-1pm (outside for bathroom & play for 30min before), come home for an hour where we go outside and do some heavy fetch for at least 30min, then go back to work 2pm-5 or 6pm when I take him out again. It‚Äôs not consistent, but very often I would come home in the evening and he would have pulled a ton of stuff from my pantry and brought it all to his bed and shredded it. Not eating anything, just destroying. After a few weeks of this we met with his vet again who prescribed him Trazodone (200mg, he‚Äôs 95#). This has been wonderful!! The destructive behavior stopped right away‚Ä¶‚Ä¶for a several weeks. Now I see it again occasionally, but not as major as before. For example today it was a bag of my V60 coffee filters. Went and got them, brought to his bed, shredded. 

I‚Äôm considering upping his dose on those longer days I work but just didn‚Äôt know if anyone else had any thoughts. I have tried so many different toys, snuffle mats, dog tv, puzzle boxes, calming treats, etc and none seem to do anything. It‚Äôs like he isn‚Äôt interested in toys or anything unless I‚Äôm there with him. I also thought about a camera I could check in on him and speak to him? 

Really sorry for the long winded post, I just feel sorry for the guy. He‚Äôs so happy when I‚Äôm with him and it kills me to think he‚Äôs stressed out. Also Saturday is his birthday and we‚Äôre making banana & pumpkin pupcakes. ",1,1745972352.0,DogAdvice,4,1.0,False

1kb31xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1kb31xc/considering_giving_up_and_accepting_this_as_my/,Considering giving up and accepting this as my reality.,"Hi everyone thanks for being here! This post is quite honesty longer than my patience and I apologize for that.  I (30F) have been half ass advocating for my chronic constipation since about 2020 when I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at 25 and started seeking help for my alcoholism and eating disorders. I have dealt with constipation since I was a child, que traumatic memories of getting suppositories because we didnt go to the doctor. When I was old enough to manage my own bathroom habits, I was having type 1 or 2 movements maybe once a week until this last year I was having no movement without laxative intervention.

\-October 2024 I suddenly started having type 7-like straight brown water- 10+ times a day. I was quickly able to do multiple stool test to rule out infection (Shiga, C-Diff, Giardia, Cryptosporid, Salmonella, E coli, etc.) all negative. I had a referral in to a GI in June of 2024 to finally address my chronic constipation but my primary warned me it would be an uphill battle getting help bc most GI docs would see my history of drinking and¬† eating disorders and chalk everything up to that-which I was prepared to fight against, so that appt was coming up at the beginning of January 2025 but was now seeking answers for the crippling diarrhea which I had literally never experienced before in my life.

\-(1/6/25) ¬†My first GI appt we did some blood work-all normal, and an x-ray to make sure there was no impactions-there wasn‚Äôt. Her first thought was SIBO, the test showed I was methane positive and was treated with a round of Rifaximin and Neomcin. This did not change any of my symptoms, I was still painfully bloating the second I ate or drank anything and no changes in my 10+ liquid shits a day. The GI also referred me to pelvic floor PT, I completed 6 sessions with no measurable progress due to the diarrhea.

\-(2/10/25) I then had a colonoscopy with a 3 day extended prep, this was clear expect hemorrhoids and somehow stool still in my colon-this seemed like an important piece but it was chalked up to me not doing prep well which was not the case. I struggled to start eating anything after prep because I hadn‚Äôt physically felt that good in a long time even with intense prep.

\-(3/20/25) My next visit she said it was probably just IBS to which I asked ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that just a blanket diagnosis when you don‚Äôt know what is causing my issues?‚Äù, she didn‚Äôt appreciate that but I‚Äôm long past being pleasant. After that visit she ordered an ultrasound to check my gallbladder because of my constant back pain and ordered an enzyme stool test. In the meantime I started Amitriptyline to see if it will end up helping long term, and short term I started on the drink packet Chloestyramine/Questran 1 3x daily with meals, I took that for 4 days with no significant improvement besides I was somehow constipated and having diarrhea and it was causing me extreme back pain so she told me to stop those as they should have already worked if they were going to.

\-April 2^(nd) my ultrasound came back clear but the enzyme test showed an elastase level of 192 so I started Pancrelipase 1 pill 3x daily with meals. She then ordered a CT with contrast of my abdomen to see my pancreas better-everything was normal. I took the enzymes in various amounts after my initial few days because it wasn‚Äôt making a difference, I took them for about 2 weeks with continued bloating, pencil thin stools multiple times a day with no relief or feeling like I‚Äôve full emptied my bowels, even if I take MiraLAX. My follow up keeps getting rescheduled and I‚Äôm debating even going back. I am waiting for a referral to the hospital that I do all my regular doctoring though for a second opinion.

At the beginning of all of this I started on low FODMAP but it didn‚Äôt matter being that strict so I loosely follow it still, quit all carbonated drinks, 1-2 cups of coffee now, much better water intake, gluten free, dairy free, safe foods are cheerios, oatmeal ‚Äì I can add a small amount of frozen fruit or an egg with it, occasionally a GF protein bar, and luckily Gatorade and glucose tablets (I‚Äòm guess it‚Äôs due to the small quantity) to manage low blood sugar. I have somehow not lost any weight, if anything it feels as though I‚Äôve gained despite D and pretty significant restriction. I take quite a high dose of Magnesium Complex in addition to Lyrica 150mg 3x daily to help with my neuropathy, Spironolactone 50mg for skin help with no improvement, insulin, vitamin D3, and Amitriptyline 30mg. I do work with a dietician but she specializes more in eating disorders combined with diabetes so she‚Äôs been at a loss besides just encouraging me to eat what I can. I work part time, online college full time, I have a lot of external stressors but they are all out of my control. I walk everywhere so I do have plenty of movement. My depression and anxiety are the worst they‚Äôve been in a long time- I do go to therapy and have a great team though. I‚Äôve been sober for over 2 years and things literally have only gotten worse medically. ¬†I‚Äôve considered adding in a few supplements but what‚Äôs the point if my body isn‚Äôt absorbing them? I was also diagnosed with Hashimoto's in the beginning of 2024 and its now somehow resolved itself??? I took Synthroid for about 9 months up until october when the D started, we checked my thyroid function and it was low now. Feb 2025 it was still lower end of normal. 

This thread and learning how to use reddit has been so beneficial to me as I learn literally everything I can about how to just fucking feel even a little bit better and know there are people there who understand the struggle. I just feel at a loss right now as to what I should do. I feel like I‚Äôm making up all my problems at this point and wasting everyone‚Äôs time. Does this sound similar to anyone else‚Äôs journey or is there anything else to consider to ask about?

I knew things weren‚Äôt going well, but it‚Äôs finals season and we‚Äôre both anxious about summer internships so I thought some of it might be that. I was having some issues, too, but we had a really productive conversation about a week and a half ago so I was hopeful that we were moving onto more stable ground. 

We were on a walk really late at night, and he starts opening up about some mental health issues he‚Äôs been having. We wind up talking about the problems in our relationship, and I thought it was actually going really well. But then he told me he exchanged nudes with some stranger on Snapchat earlier that week, and I kind of broke down. (For context, he‚Äôs always maintained that exchanging nudes with strangers is just like porn, so he didn‚Äôt consider it cheating.) 

As I‚Äôm crying, he‚Äôs going on about how he doesn‚Äôt know whether he loves me. He says he cares about me and doesn‚Äôt want me to get hurt, but he doesn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs even capable of love. On top of that, I have some people-pleasing issues, and he feels like I‚Äôm not working on them/cant bring up things that bother me so it just festers. On top of *that*, he feels like we‚Äôre incompatible because I‚Äôm more conventional-acting in public whereas he sees it all as pointless and arbitrary (as long as no one is actually hurt). 

He also said he felt like we didn‚Äôt really connect over shared interests. I agree that we have issues, but I don‚Äôt agree that they can‚Äôt be fixed. But he said that he wasnt going to break up with me unless I agreed. After about a five hour conversation with lots of tears and apologies and whatnot, I told him I wanted to go to bed and resolve it in the morning, but he said he really wanted an answer before we went to bed, so I more or less just let him break up with me. Like I said the words ‚Äúwe‚Äôre breaking up‚Äù but‚Ä¶ idk. We agreed to tell people it was mutual. 

We‚Äôre getting coffee next week, partly by my request the morning after because I instantly regretted breaking up (not that I had much of a choice?). But a short break through finals week with a revisiting at the end of the week was one of the options thrown around, so I actually have no idea where we stand. 

If he is open to it when we see each other next, is it even worth trying to get back together? I miss him so much, and I regret breaking up with him, but there are real issues in this relationship. I‚Äôd only agree to get back together if we both get into counseling and lay some serious ground rules. ",1,1745971535.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False
1kb2z13,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1kb2z13/im_trying_to_understand_my_dissociation_or/,"I‚Äôm trying to understand my dissociation, or whether what I experience even is dissociation or not.","Long post warning by the way, sorry!üòÖ

I just want to preface this by saying, I‚Äôve not been diagnosed with anything and I haven‚Äôt even gone to therapy (yet, I want to), and I‚Äôm not trying to imposter myself as a CPTSD victim. I‚Äôve only very recently come to the discovery/realisation that I suffered from emotional neglect as a child, and I want to talk about dissociation in particular. A few reasons I‚Äôm not posting this on the emotional neglect sub, A) I have already posted in there twice today and don‚Äôt want to turn the feed into a spam feed for my wave of questions and discussion, this sub also seems to get a lot more replies and feedback on each post, this sub also seems like the most qualified place to ask about dissociation stemming from childhood emotional neglect. 

Also if I‚Äôm being truthfully honest with you, I‚Äôve read a lot of stuff about the typical symptoms of CPTSD and scarily I can resonate with a lot of it which sort of freaks me out and confuses me because my upbringing wasn‚Äôt physically or sexually abusive and I haven‚Äôt seen my friends get blown up in war so I really can‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôd ever have something as severe as CPTSD, but I‚Äôve found myself resonating with a lot of what people say here and a lot of what the typical symptoms are so that‚Äôs probably one of the main reasons why I‚Äôve gone out on a limb and posted here instead of the emotional neglect sub. Still though, I highly doubt I could have something as severe as CPTSD because I haven‚Äôt been through anytning as awful as violent abuse or witnessed gory death or what not so I do feel like a major imposter posting here and I am fully happy to take the post down if it isn‚Äôt welcome!

With all that said, if it would be better to delete this and repost it in the emotional neglect sub, I am more than happy to! Also, I‚Äôve had people speed read my post history and say that my issues don‚Äôt sound that bad, I just want to put out a disclaimer that there‚Äôs a lot more to my upbringing to what I‚Äôve shared on Reddit, the stuff I have shared on Reddit is tip of the iceberg surface level stuff I feel comfortable publicly sharing, and things I‚Äôm unsure about whether they were actually issues etc. I just want to put that out there because I‚Äôve had people look through my post history, not see any posts about some grand tragedy and tell me that ‚Äúmy childhood was probably fine‚Äù because of it lol.

Anyway, into the actual core of the post it‚Äôs self. Dissociation. I only truly came to the realisation today that I do it, a LOT. Or atleast, I think I do it but I‚Äôm not entirely 100% confident in myself to say that I absolutely do it, but I think I do, and I was wondering if you guys could read through what I think is me dissociating, and tell me if I‚Äôm just forgetful and don‚Äôt pay enough attention or whether what I experience is genuinely dissociation.

I think the most prevalent issue causer is when it happens at work. I‚Äôve noticed, at work there‚Äôs 2 main environments where it happens, which is A) when someone who has direct authority over me is speaking directly to me, and B) when I‚Äôm around all my coworkers who are just having general conversation and I zone out without realising. I‚Äôll go into both scenarios in full detail in separate paragraphs.

So when people with a position of authority over me are directly talking to me, telling me to do something for example, I always seem to sort of ‚Äúblack out‚Äù part way through the conversation. They‚Äôll start telling me I need to do something and then somewhere after the first part of the conversation it is just a black spot in my mind. I don‚Äôt even realise I‚Äôm doing it in the moment, but then I‚Äôll walk away and literally a few minutes later I‚Äôm like ‚Äúshit, I know they were just saying something to me and I can remember a few words from the beginning of the conversation, but that‚Äôs it.‚Äù It‚Äôs like the rest of the conversation didn‚Äôt even happen, like it‚Äôs just erased from my memory as if someone used the men in black memory flash pen on me half way through the conversation. And again, I don‚Äôt notice anytnjng unusual or different in the moment (although that may be because I‚Äôve only just realised I do it, or atleast I think I do). It‚Äôs just fully gone from my memory and as hard as I try to reconstruct the conversation in my head, there‚Äôs just a big empty spot where I don‚Äôt really have a recollection of anything. And the empty spot starts somewhere near the start of the conversation and ends after the conversation when the person with authority has walked away. I do notice sometimes when I‚Äôm being told to do things or what not by someone above me, it‚Äôs an involuntary thing sometimes where my eyes sort of unfocus themselves and sometimes I can catch myself in the moment actively falling behind in keeping track of the conversation and trying to prompt myself to refire my attention to be present in the moment, but it‚Äôs sort of like when you see someone who keeps drifting off to sleep and then nodding up quickly to peel themselves back awake, and then drifting back off again. Other than that though, I don‚Äôt really have any other observation about it to truly talk about because I just don‚Äôt remember any of it happening. I can only compare the complete blank spot in my memory to the one time in my childhood when I somersaulted off a trampoline and cracked my head on a patio tile, and came back round to my senses a few hours later and my family was telling me about all these things that had happened during the day that I was there for and present in the moment, but I had absolutely no knowledge or recollection of. Like a complete blank spot in my memory. That‚Äôs what I get quite often when someone in a position of authority is directly talking to me, telling me they want me to do something etc, the blank spot starts somewhere roughly around the beginning part of the conversation and ends  a short while after the conversation has finished. I‚Äôve gotten into trouble repeatedly over the years for not doing things I‚Äôve been asked to do and I feel terrible about it every time because I try really hard to do the best job I can but it‚Äôs like I get asked to do things and I genuinely don‚Äôt even o know I‚Äôve been asked to do this specific job so I don‚Äôt do it and then get in trouble. Oh also, the reason I made the clarification that this happens specifically when people with authority over me speak to me directly, is that I never get this when I‚Äôm in conversation one on one with other people. Like, me and my coworkers who are ‚Äúon the same level‚Äù as me will be discussing the jobs at hand and dividing/splitting up the jobs between us to decide who will do what, I remember those conversations perfectly. I magically never seem to forget when it‚Äôs instructional stuff about what jobs I need to be doing, if it‚Äôs in conversation with someone who doesn‚Äôt hold a position of power over me. The bad memory just magically goes away in that scenario.

The other environment where I *think* I dissociate in semi regularly, less often than authoritative people talking directly to me, but it‚Äôs still semi regular. Group settings where multiple people are all having conversation, and I sort of just slip into the background. I‚Äôve noticed quite often that lets say me and all my coworkers are all sitting in the workshop on our coffee break and there‚Äôs just conversation going on, I‚Äôll zone out in a specific way. I sort of just look round and stare into the distance and focus on one specific object or point in my vision and sort of lock onto it like tunnel vision, and I forgot to say but I don‚Äôt realise I‚Äôm doing it in the moment. But yeah so I‚Äôm sat still locked onto this one point looking away from the others and without me even realising it happens, it‚Äôs like I lose all of my senses, like I‚Äôve slipped out of the back door of my own mind/consciousness. The lights are on but nobody is home. Like in the Insidious movies when that badass old lady is astral walking and her body is present but her actual consciousness is on a completely different plane of existence. That was only a comparison to describe how absent I get, I don‚Äôt actually feel like my spiritual body has parted ways with my physical body and I‚Äôm astral walking, like I said that was only a comparison, but if you‚Äôve watched the movies you‚Äôll probably understand the metaphor I‚Äôm making out of it. It‚Äôs the weirdest thing and I don‚Äôt know how to describe it very well which is why I‚Äôm comparing it to a corny horror movie series. But anyway, when I‚Äôm in this state, my coworkers will try saying something to me and I just don‚Äôt respond at all, and it‚Äôs happened numerous times where multiple coworkers are literally looking directly at me, saying my name loudly directly to me and I don‚Äôt even realise because it‚Äôs like all my senses are muted. And I mean like, imagine multiple people directly saying your name to you loudly and you still being locked on to this one point not even hearing them or being aware any of this is going on. And then randomly after an amount of time I sort of sense their presence in a subtle way and snap out of it, turn around to them as if I‚Äôve just instantly responded to them saying my name, and then they look at me in a sort of shock like ‚Äúdid you not just hear us calling your name directly at you?‚Äù. They joke that I just daydream a lot, but it‚Äôs nothing like a day dream. When I day dream, I‚Äôm present in my own mind, thinking about hypotheticals like how I‚Äôd fortify in a zombie apocalypse or whatever and I‚Äôm present minded and respond to outside stimuli and I still have access to all my senses, but when this happens it‚Äôs a completely different thing. I think the best way I can describe it is as I already said, like I‚Äôve just randomly slipped out of the back door of my own mind/consciousness without even knowing I did it. 

But, I don‚Äôt know if this actually is dissociation, or whether I truly do just lack attention and I‚Äôm just chronically forgetful. Like I said at the start of the post, I‚Äôve only just realised I was a victim of emotional neglect, so there‚Äôs a lot of things I‚Äôve never questioned and thought were normal until I‚Äôve recently realised they weren‚Äôt. This is one of them things where I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overthinking it and I‚Äôm just a forgetful person who struggles to pay attention, or whether what I‚Äôve described actually is proper dissociation. I‚Äôve had a hard time actually accepting and admiring I was emotionally neglected so all sorts of things like this I‚Äôve played down to myself and dismissed that it‚Äôs probably nothing important, but I think this might be something of significance which is why I‚Äôm trying to gain some clarity on whether what I‚Äôve described actually is dissociation or not.

Edit - it‚Äôs only been a few minutes since I uploaded this, but I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt say further up in the post. I work for our family company, my dad and grandad are my bosses, they are the people with authority over me. I don‚Äôt really like telling people that I work for a family company out of fear for what people will think of me for it, but I thought it‚Äôs probably relevant enough to mention, that my two main bosses are my dad and grandad. The only other person with a real authority over me is my mentor who runs the workshop/garage I work in, and he‚Äôs a lovely supportive guy. I do get forgetful or dissociate when he gives me direct instructions, but it‚Äôs less frequent than when it‚Äôs my dad or grandad.",3,1745971501.0,CPTSD,3,1.0,False

Yesterday, I was working at a cafe and there was a guy sitting next to me, also working. At one point, I needed to use the toilet, so I asked him if he could keep an eye on my stuff while I was gone, and he kindly said yes.

When I came back, he started just general small talk like what I do for work, and I asked him a bit about his job and where he lives/works too. After that, we both went back to doing our own thing.

About an hour later, he started packing up to leave. His laptop charger was under my seat, so he asked me to move a bit. I smiled and made space. I thought that was it, but then he started another short convo, saying he wasn‚Äôt that productive, asking how long I‚Äôd be staying, etc. Before he left, he asked for my Instagram, and I gave it to him.

I accepted his follow request right after he left, but he didn‚Äôt accept mine until about 6 hours later - and hasn‚Äôt sent any DMs since.

He doesn‚Äôt give off ‚Äúplayer‚Äù vibes - he has very few girls on his followers/following lists. I actually like him and would be down to grab a coffee or drink, but I usually let guys reach out first and am unsure if I should make a move.

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! ‚ú® 

Ever find yourself staring at your to-do list, feeling more overwhelmed than focused? You‚Äôre not alone. I mean, who hasn‚Äôt tried time blocking, only to continuously hit ‚Äúsnooze‚Äù on that productivity timer? üò© It‚Äôs like a treadmill that just makes you tired without going anywhere!

So, what‚Äôs the deal? Let me introduce you to something I‚Äôve recently discovered: **Energy Stacking**. Yeah, it sounds cool, but bear with me‚Äîit‚Äôs simpler than it sounds!

**So what is Energy Stacking?** ü§î  
Imagine your brain as a battery‚Äîsome days it‚Äôs charged up and raring to go, other days it feels like you‚Äôre running on fumes. Here‚Äôs how Energy Stacking helps you work *with* your energy, not against it:

- **10-Second Rule**: This gem is all about starting tasks within 10 seconds of feeling that initial spark of motivation. üèÉüí® If you wait too long, you‚Äôll start to second-guess yourself (and before you know it, you're scrolling TikTok instead of tackling that report).
  
- **Identify Your Energy Peaks**: Notice when you feel most energized during the day. Morning person? Tackle the hard stuff then. Night owl? Save the brain-busters for after dinner!

- **Pair Tasks by Energy Level**: Think about what tasks give you energy versus those that drain you. Combine energy-giving tasks with the ones you dread. For example, after a quick workout or a walk (energy boost), dive into that project you‚Äôve been avoiding.

Here‚Äôs a little breakdown of what that might look like:

1. Morning coffee ‚òïÔ∏è ‚Üí Quick task: Respond to emails (easy win!)
2. Mid-morning walk üö∂ ‚Üí Hard task: Write that essay or tackle the tough project.
3. Afternoon slump üç© ‚Üí Recharge with a fun hobby for 10 mins, then jump back into something lighter.

**Why does this work?** It‚Äôs all about giving yourself grace and listening to your body. How many times have you forced your brain to focus only to find yourself daydreaming about lunch? üôÑ By stacking your tasks according to your energy levels, you're way more likely to get in the zone.

**Here‚Äôs the kicker:**  
You don't have to be perfect. Think of it as playing around with your schedule rather than locking yourself into a rigid box. Ever noticed you can binge a series for hours but struggle to read a single chapter of a book? Your brain thrives on *interest* and *energy*, not just time on the clock!

So, next time you feel the urge to grace your calendar with time blocks, give Energy Stacking a shot. Who knows? You might find maximizing your energy blends that productivity and fun you‚Äôre always chasing!

What are your thoughts on this? Ever tried something similar or have a hilarious time-blocking fail story? Let‚Äôs have a chat! üî•",1,1745971303.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm still devastated, so please excuse any grammatical errors as I‚Äôm running on caffeine and no sleep between hours of crying. 

I just found out on Monday that my(25f) bf(26m) has cheated yet again, with two girls this time. And that‚Äôs not even the worst part of it all. 

He went out with one girl- we‚Äôll call her Anna for the sake of keeping them all in their own lanes, back in October after accidentally adding her on Snapchat. She had no idea he wasn‚Äôt single, and came to me and told me about them, and swore up and down nothing happened, and based on the texts and snaps- that was true. Aside from the dates which were only 3-4 times. Because me and my bf had been dating for just over 8 years at that point, I gave him the option to either do couples therapy to see if we could work through this, or I‚Äôd end it right then and there. He chose therapy.

ON TO THIS WEEK:
We‚Äôve been in a really good place lately, just moved at the beginning of this month, and I found out on accident he‚Äôs proposing soon, so I thought our relationship was going amazing. I have this thing for taking random pics of myself on his phone and setting them as his background as a lil surprise- usually when I feel cute or silly. I was taking a pic and setting it as my background, when a text from a girl I never heard of came in- we‚Äôll call her Jade. NBD, he works with SEVERAL women and I don‚Äôt know all their names so I always give him the benefit of the doubt at first. But then jades message came through with a preview of a photo. Turns out, they‚Äôd been swapping nudes every morning FOR THE LAST TWO MONTHS. Now jade doesn‚Äôt even live in our state, so they‚Äôve never met up. He‚Äôd take his phone in the bathroom and take one while he was in the shower, and had her ‚Äúmuted‚Äù so his phone would notify if she texted. He just got a brand new phone and I‚Äôm assuming forgot to update his settings/preferences to make sure it stayed a secret. To say that made me sick is an understatement. Turns out, they‚Äôve been on and off doing this and flirting FOR SIX YEARS. Six. Whole. Years. I read the last few months of messages(and got my screenshots of all the messages yes) and he‚Äôs openly told her he‚Äôs been single. Several times. I close out of her messages, and wouldn‚Äôt you know it? ANOTHER GIRL POPS UP.

At this point, I‚Äôm already enraged and heart broken. So I open the message. Sure enough- they met at his work, we‚Äôll call this one Katie. Katie was a customer and she thought he was cute and vice versa, and he gave her his number. They‚Äôve been talking since Thursday. Flirting messages, he sent her flowers and ordered her lunch on Friday, and was picking her up coffee to drop off at her job on the way to his yesterday. He also clearly told her he‚Äôs single, and again, I have screenshots of everything. 

I‚Äôm honestly sick to my stomach. I know I‚Äôm an idiot for even giving him a second chance the first time months ago, but now, I‚Äôm just beyond shattered. I just need to vent for the moment, but if anyone has any LEGAL vengeful suggestions for down the road, I‚Äôm also open to hearing. More than anything, I just need someone to know aside from me. Because I haven‚Äôt told him I know due to me being on opposite shifts for work this past week. I‚Äôm not telling him over text. If he‚Äôs gonna keep lying and doing this, he‚Äôs going to tell me to my face as much as that‚Äôll hurt. ",3,1745971298.0,CheatersConfronted,0,0.8,False

1kb2s88,https://www.reddit.com/r/isfp/comments/1kb2s88/advice_about_isfps_behavior/,Advice about ISFP‚Äôs behavior?,"My ISFP (30m) partner and I (INTJ, 30f) have been getting into some really bad arguments lately and I‚Äôm at my wits end. For context, we live together. 

I had my final exam for school this past week and I really needed to study so I was gone a lot to the library or coffee shop most of the day Saturday and then Sunday I went to visit my parents (and study there). I spent the night and when I came back, the apartment we live in was completely trashed. I‚Äôm talking candy wrappers all over the bed, floor, and night stand. There was literal trash all over the living room from the dog getting into the trash and him only cleaning like 80% of it. There were clothes everywhere. 

I spent almost two hours cleaning instead of studying for my exam because messes give me really bad anxiety and it was impacting my ability to focus. We got into a really bad fight about it. 

Then I thought we sort made up and I asked him to help me brush the dog. We have a husky/malamute and his winter coat is coming out. His fur was super impacted when we adopted him from a friend of a friend who couldn‚Äôt take care of him anymore. He was very neglected. For anyone who doesn‚Äôt know about impacted fur, it can be very painful for dogs and it increases their chances of getting an infection or other things. So understandably, the dog really hates getting brushed because historically it‚Äôs been very painful for him. I‚Äôve worked with him a lot to help him get through it, but he still doesn‚Äôt like it (although it doesn‚Äôt cause too much pain anymore).

Well, he was holding the dog and I was trying to carefully and gently brush out the impacted fur and knots. Being a husky, he kept trying to get away and I kept having to ask my partner to hold him still because if he jumps away like that when I‚Äôm brushing out a knot, he‚Äôs going to end up yanking his fur out and it‚Äôs going to hurt really bad. My partner kept letting him jump around and I had to keep reminding him not to. I tried to be calm and patient, but I was starting to get really frustrated with him. 

Well, the husky jumped while I was working on a really difficult and dense spot and just like I predicted, he yelped in pain and I got so mad. I told my partner that was his fault and he needed to stop trying to be the dog‚Äôs friend and hold him steady. 

Then my partner got up and walked out of the room without saying anything. I followed and he said he didn‚Äôt want to be criticized anymore, that I was hurting his feelings‚Ä¶.

And I just don‚Äôt even know what to say or do at this point. Like I was nice the first 10-15 times I asked him to not let the dog move. I explained the importance of brushing him out. I tapped into my Fi and told him about how much better the dog will feel and how he‚Äôll be in a lot of pain if we don‚Äôt brush him. I related back to him. I said that it makes me feel bad too seeing the husky unhappy but that I loved the dog too much to stand seeing him in pain or uncomfortable. I also mentioned that I was really worried about him possibly overheating and even dying if we didn‚Äôt help brush out his undercoat. 

And he just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt do the one thing I asked for help with. And yes, I did start to get frustrated but I don‚Äôt think I was ‚Äúcriticizing‚Äù him. I was just saying things like ‚Äúcome on, seriously hold him, I need you to hold him or he‚Äôs going to get hurt again‚Äù no personal attacks, no insults to his character. Just reminders of how to hold him correctly. 

So.. does anyone have any insight into why he‚Äôs acting like this? Because I‚Äôm so completely lost. Like it‚Äôs one thing for us to argue with each other about our boundaries, but it‚Äôs a whole other thing in my book to let your personal feelings impact an innocent creature. 

I‚Äôd really like insight, but I‚Äôm also open to advice and solutions. ",3,1745970953.0,isfp,2,1.0,False

1kb2rd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/JewishDating/comments/1kb2rd4/dating_issues_male_late_30s/,Dating issues (male - late 30s),"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm looking for some advice and perspective on a dating challenge I‚Äôve been facing.

I‚Äôm in my late 30s‚Äîstable job, financially secure, educated at a top university, tall, in good shape, and living near a major city. Overall, I do well with dating, but I‚Äôve consistently struggled when it comes to dating Jewish women, which is particularly frustrating because I‚Äôd genuinely like to build a long-term relationship with someone who shares my background.

Here‚Äôs the issue: on dating apps, I rarely have trouble getting responses or making plans with non-Jewish women. They‚Äôre generally open to meeting for coffee, drinks, or lunch‚Äîcasual first dates that I‚Äôm happy to pay for. With them, there‚Äôs usually a natural progression: we meet, connect, things often get physical fairly quickly (which is fine), but those situations tend not to last long-term as I‚Äôm still single, of course. With Jewish women, however, I often face vague communication, ghosting, last-minute cancellations, or a general unwillingness to commit to plans‚Äîeven when I offer to meet in their area and keep things low-key. It‚Äôs left me confused and a bit discouraged.

An additional detail that might be relevant: I‚Äôm politically moderate on political issues (I vote Republican), though I try to avoid bringing politics into dating conversations at all.

Some questions I‚Äôve been reflecting on:

1- Is this possibly an issue of motivation? I would assume that, like me, many Jewish women in their 30s are looking for marriage and children. Is this not true?
2- Am I approaching things wrong? I tend to avoid offering dinner on a first date‚ÄîI prefer something more casual to start and save dinner for a second meeting.

Lastly, I want to acknowledge how easy it is to fall into generalizations or frustrations that can come off the wrong way, especially online. I‚Äôve made a conscious effort to avoid any misogynistic thinking and writing/communication, but if anything I‚Äôve said sounds off, I‚Äôd appreciate the feedback. I‚Äôm genuinely open to learning and improving how I show up in this space.

Whenever a customer orders I run the ‚Äòsize, milk type, here or to go, food yes or no‚Äô riddle, or ask for the info that lacks in the order. So when a customer orders a medium cappuccino to go, I ask ‚Äòwhat type of milk would you like?‚Äô (I awarely say cow ‚Äòmilk instead‚Äô of ‚Äòregular milk‚Äô when communicating the options because I don‚Äôt think the way that cows and calves are treated should be ‚Äòregular‚Äô, as I think it‚Äôs unethical to treat animals like this). 

Customers mostly don‚Äôt seem to expect this question, as they respond by saying ‚Äòregular milk!!!‚Äô whilst looking at me like I asked them wether salt and sugar are the same thing. Happily, there are customers that calmly respond to my inquiries and the overall interaction runs smoothly (this sentence only concerns the behavior of the customer, regardless of the milk choice). One time when I asked for the milk type, the customer answered by saying ‚Äòyou may choose for me‚Äô. I asked a few follow up questions to try to get a sense of their preferences, but they just kept repeating that I should choose and didn‚Äôt give me any clues. It surprised me as I got stuck in a little dilemma. What milk should I choose?! And what happens when I make them something they say ‚Äòoh this tastes bad‚Äô, do I have to make them a new one or is it their own responsibility? (Happily the customer in question was pleased with the milk type I chose ü§ì)

At the place where I fabricate magic caffeine potions, there is cows, oat, almond, soy and coconut milk. Because of my beliefs, cows milk is a definite no no. This leaves the plant based milks. But which one should I pick?! Oat or soy milk because then I can make better latte art, almond or coconut milk because it makes the coffee taste funny (but almond is prone to generate blobs), oat (or a sustainable soy) for total environmental impact or do I just close my eyes do a spin and choose one at ‚ú®random‚ú®

1kb2jzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BadandyTheRed/comments/1kb2jzw/the_rains_embrace_a_cycle_of_drowning_shadows/,The Rain's Embrace: A Cycle of Drowning Shadows.,"I still can‚Äôt believe she is gone. [My sister Laura, her friends, all drowned.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/17o761o/i_still_hear_the_footsteps_in_the_rain/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) At least that was what we were told. We attended a funeral, but not all the bodies were recovered. Laura‚Äôs was gone but three of her friends were recovered. It gave some glimmer of hope that she was not dead, just missing. After a year though, it seemed unlikely she would be found. The area had been searched. We were told that divers went into the lake to try and find the missing ones, but no one could.

It was devastating for my family. But what I could not understand is what exactly happened. All we knew when she left was that Laura was going on a trip with her friends last year for spring break. It was a place in the mountains several hours away. The lake Kashur Resort and Spa. Apparently they had gone into the lake one night during a storm. They had allegedly been drunk and somehow each one of them had drowned. The proprietor of the place was unable to be reached for comment, but authorities said that all evidence pointed to a tragic accident.

Normally I would not have done anything but grieve for the loss of my sister, but then the letter arrived. It was from a man named Tim. He was the sole survivor of my sisters trip, he had an outlandish tale of impossible things that sounded like the delusional ravings of a person with survivors guilt.

The authorities' statement, predictably, clashed with his deranged ravings. They insisted it was a drunken swim party gone awry, resulting in an accidental death. But I never believed it, not about my sister. She was far too controlled to get intoxicated, and even if she had, she would never be so careless. Yet, the official investigation was stalled if not ended entirely.

The letter was genuinely disturbing, a cryptic tale from my sisters former friend,

""I can still hear their screams echoing in my mind. All of them. Adam and Gina were the first to fall, the splashing footsteps, swallowed by water, it was impossible. Yes, they drowned‚Ä¶but not in the lake. Laura, Becky, and I managed to reach the resort, the staff left us to fend for ourselves! Those things, the shapes, they followed us there.

They were in the rain, the lake, it was our fate, sealed and inescapable.

Forgive me, Becky, Laura. I tried, I really tried, but I was too late.

I am sending this to any of your family member who will listen.

I beg you, do not let them get away with this. They knew. They knew what would happen.""

It was the creeping madness of that letter that made it seem like a fever dream, or a drug-induced delusion. Yet something in Tim's words, the raw terror that bled through his scrawled handwriting, made my skin crawl with a truth I couldn't explain. I put the letter away and departed.

I struggled with the decision to reach out to the man to verify the details of his story. I had sent a letter hoping for a response, yet he remained silent, and I lacked his contact number. I learned he had relocated to Nevada, and the idea of traveling such a distance just to confront him felt overwhelming. His statements to the police seemed too outlandish to take seriously, yet part of me couldn‚Äôt shake the nagging curiosity about the truth behind his claims.

I had to know for sure, so I made the decision.

I would go to Lake Kashur and try and find my sister or at least say goodbye to her at the last place she was seen.

The trip took nearly seven hours, rain pelting my windshield most of the way. Though gloomy, the drive was not unpleasant and the area was admittedly beautiful. The further I drove, the more isolated the roads became, until I was winding through dense forest on a single-lane road that didn't appear on my GPS.

My phone disconnected and reconnected for the tenth time before losing the signal completely.

Just when I began to think I'd made a terrible mistake, the trees parted, revealing Lake Kashur Resort and Spa. It looked impressive, though unpopulated. The main building, a sprawling three-story lodge with weathered cedar siding, boasted against a backdrop of fog-shrouded mountains. Several smaller cabins dotted the shoreline, their windows dark and uninviting.

The lake itself stretched vast and resplendent, its surface rippling despite the absence of wind. Though it was impressive and serene, something in the shifting waters made my skin crawl.

A sign on the road indicated: ""Welcome to Lake Kashur - Where Memories Run Deep.""

Someone had scratched something beneath it, but it looked like a thin layer of slap dash paint had been applied over it, trying to cover whatever message someone had attempted to carve into the sign.

I parked in the nearly empty lot, only a resort truck and a few cars were there. Pulling my jacket tighter against the chill, I grabbed my bag and headed to the entrance as the skies darkened and thunder rumbled. Inside, the dim lobby was lit by antique fixtures casting long shadows across the polished floors, and I moved toward the reception desk.

A rustling sound came from behind the reception desk before a woman appeared, her movements so suddenly I nearly jumped.

""Welcome to Lake Kashur,"" she said. ""Do you have a reservation?""

""No, I was hoping to speak with someone about an accident that happened here last year.""

She studied me for an uncomfortably long moment. ""I am sorry we are not able to disclose details of any incidents that happened here to the press.""

""Well no, I am a relative. My name is Connor, I'm here because my sister stayed here last spring. Laura Hanson? She would have been in a larger group of people visiting for spring break. Could I check the guest book?""

Something flickered across her face.

""I'll need to get the manager,"" she said abruptly, reaching for a phone beneath the counter. She turned away slightly, her voice dropping to a whisper. ""Mr. Dalton? There's a young man asking about an incident. Yes, last spring."" She paused, listening. ""Yes, sir. Right away.""

She hung up and fixed that empty smile on me again. ""Mr. Dalton will be right with you. Please wait just a moment.""

Before I could respond, a tall figure emerged from a doorway I hadn't noticed before. He moved with unsettling grace for someone so gaunt, his impeccable suit hanging from his frame as if from a wire hanger.

""Gregory Dalton, proprietor of Lake Kashur Resort. I understand you have questions about your sister.""

He gestured toward a seating area away from the desk. ""Please, let's speak somewhere more comfortable.""

I followed him to a pair of leather chairs positioned near a window overlooking the lake. The rain had intensified, drops streaking the glass like tears.

""Laura Hanson,"" he said, folding his hands in his lap. ""Such a tragedy. I remember her vividly. Bright young woman. Studious. Not like the others in her group.""

The way he described her was uncannily accurate. I leaned forward. ""If I could be direct, what do you know about what really happened to her, Mr. Dalton? The official report says they drowned, but my sister was an excellent swimmer.""

Dalton's eyes flicked toward the sound before returning to me.

""Rules exist for a reason, Mr. Hanson. Sometimes tragic ones."" His voice lowered, almost hypnotic in its rhythm. ""Your sister and her friends were warned, as all our guests are, that swimming during rainfall is strictly prohibited at Lake Kashur. A liability issue, you understand.""

""That doesn't make sense. Why would rain make them drown? And if there was a rule, Laura wouldn't break it like that.""

""Peer pressure can be a powerful motivator, even for the most disciplined among us."" He sighed, a practiced sound of rehearsed regret. ""They were young. Exuberant. Perhaps they thought our warnings were superstitious, many do.""

I felt a chill that had nothing to do with the draft in the old building. ""What exactly are you saying happened?""

""They went swimming during a storm much like this one."" Dalton gestured toward the window. ""The lake can be unpredictable. Currents shift. Temperatures drop suddenly. People lose track of how far out they swim and then, well‚Ä¶By the time our staff realized what was happening, it was too late.""

The explanation, although hard to accept, was not entirely implausible. But still, something in his delivery felt hollow, like reciting lines from a well-rehearsed script. The pieces didn't fit. Tim's letter described something far more sinister than careless swimming.

Thunder echoed over the lake as Mr.Dalton glanced at the window. Rain poured down, churning the lake's surface. Before I could speak, Mr. Dalton interrupted,

""My sincerest condolences to you in this time of sorrow. Should you wish to remain with us for the night, I would be honored to have you stay. We have another group of young people here on break and you might enjoy their company. Besides, another tempest has arrived, and traveling amidst such torrential rain would be most perilous. Naturally, I shall provide full recompense for your night's stay, a mere token of solace in light of the profound loss of your dear sister.""

I hesitated, the conflicting information warring in my mind. I could investigate further if I stayed, maybe even find some evidence about what really happened to Laura. On the other hand, every instinct screamed that something was deeply wrong with this place.

""That's very generous,"" I said carefully. ""I think I will stay, just for the night, thank you.""

""Excellent,"" Dalton replied, his thin lips stretching into what might have been a smile. ""Room 217 should accommodate you nicely. It overlooks the lake and is close to‚Ä¶"" He stopped himself. ""Well, it has a splendid view.""

Close to where Laura went missing. He didn't need to finish, I knew that guarded look and it made me even more suspicious of just what they were hiding here.

The receptionist arrived with a brass key marked 217. ""Dinner is at seven,"" Dalton said, rising fluidly. ""Feel free to explore, but stay indoors and avoid the lake while it rains, for safety.""

""Of course,"" I agreed, accepting the key.

Dalton abruptly left, and a bellhop guided me to the second floor. The whole place had an eerie emptiness; only staff seemed to be lurking around.

The woman handed me the key and left without a word..

Inside, the room was tastefully furnished with slightly worn antique pieces, a queen bed, a writing desk by the window, and a newly renovated bathroom. The view, described as splendid, showed only a rain-beaten lake and a mist-obscured inlet. I wondered if that was where Laura went into the water?

I considered Tim's letter again. How he mentioned ""shapes in the rain"" and ""footsteps splashing on the ground."" At the time, I'd dismissed it as trauma-induced hallucinations, but now, staring at the churning lake, I wasn't so sure.

The rain intensified, drumming against the window with an almost deliberate rhythm. Thunder cracked overhead, and for a split second, I thought I saw something move beneath the lake's surface, a pale, elongated shape that wasn't there when I looked again.

The floor outside my room creaked. I froze and listened. Then I heard a shuffling sound, followed by what sounded like water dripping onto the carpet. Not the usual footsteps of someone passing by, but something different, heavier.

I crept to the door, pressing my ear against it. The dripping sound continued, followed by a strange, wet rasp like someone struggling to breathe through fluid. My hand trembled as I reached for the doorknob.

Suddenly a soft gurgling voice spoke to me, it sounded like a voice trying to speak underwater.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶need to leave. Not‚Ä¶safe, they come tonight, the sacrifice is prepared. They will awaken, and all must drown who still draw breath here‚Ä¶‚Äù

I was paralyzed with fear at the ominous warning and before I could turn the door handle and confront the mysterious voice, the sounds receded down the hallway, fading into silence. I exhaled shakily, backing away from the door. I had no idea what the hell was going on there.

I sat in confusion as a flash of lightning illuminated the room one final time,then nothing. The rain drumming on the window abruptly ceased. The sudden silence was almost more unnerving than the storm had been.

I approached the window cautiously. Outside, the transformation was startling. The lake had become a perfect mirror, reflecting the clearing sky with such precision it was difficult to discern where water ended and air began. Not a single ripple disturbed its glassy surface. The mist had vanished, revealing the entirety of the shoreline in crystalline detail.

I had heard enough, something was very wrong here and I knew it was a mistake to have come at all. I checked my phone and saw it was 6:45 PM. Dinner would be served soon, the distraction might offer some cover for getting out of there.

I slipped outside and rushed to the parking lot. To my horror I saw that all four tires of my car were now flat. Someone had deliberately slashed the tires, intending to strand me. 

My mind raced and despite my first instinct, I paused. I considered it must be Mr. Dalton, had he wanted to keep me here for whatever he was planning? I was alone and unarmed though, so I would not confront now, I just needed to leave. My heart pounded as I backed away from the car, considering the mile or two walk back to the highway. Just then, I heard laughter and chatter near the main building, the other guests Dalton mentioned. Relieved, I followed the voices to a courtyard, where five people in swimsuits stood with drinks in hand.

They were heading to the lake despite the approaching darkness and recent rain. I figured they might be able to help me get out of there, so I followed them and discovered a small cove, partially hidden by rocks, just as Tim described. A weathered wooden dock stretched twenty feet into the water. Had Laura stood here before she vanished?

As I moved toward the dock I saw the sign, bold red and indicating,

‚ÄúAbsolutely no swimming in the rain!‚Äù

They were very serious about that rule, and yet not much effort to enforce it if people just came out here and it started to rain.

The group of swimmers were making their way down the path toward the dock, their voices carrying clearly across the still night air.

""Dude, this place is amazing,"" one of the guys said, his arm slung around a girl's shoulders. ""Totally worth the price of this place.""

""I still can't believe we have the whole resort practically to ourselves,"" another girl replied, her blonde hair catching the moonlight.

""The old guy said swimming during bad weather is not recommended,"" one of the taller guys said, mimicking Dalton's formal cadence. ""But what he doesn't know won't hurt him.""

""I don't know, guys,"" a brunette girl hesitated, hugging herself. ""Did you see how he looked at us when Jake asked about swimming? It was creepy. For all we know they have hidden cameras or something.""

""Come on, Melissa,"" the guy with his arm around her urged. ""The rain stopped. It's perfect out. When will we ever get another chance like this? It's gorgeous out!""

The group stopped abruptly when they spotted me. An awkward silence fell over them.

""Hey creep what the hell?"" One of the guys called out. ""You work here or something?""

I realized they were talking to me as I was watching them from the tree line. I shook my head, stepping back toward the shore. ""No. Just a guest, like you.""

They visibly relaxed, though the brunette, Melissa still eyed me with suspicion.

""Sweet,"" said the guy who seemed to be the leader. ""We're just gonna take a quick dip. You won't tell the staff, right?""

I hesitated. These were just college kids looking to have fun, exactly like Laura and her friends had been.

""I don't think that's a good idea,"" I said, surprising myself with the firmness in my voice. ""There was an accident here last year. People died. Listen, I think we need to leave, there‚Äôs something wrong with the people who work here, something‚Äôs off. Someone slashed my tires and I heard something about a sacrifice.""

The group exchanged glances. After a pause, several of them burst into laughter.

""A sacrifice? Seriously? Did the old man put you up to this? What's next, a hook-handed killer who preys on couples making out?""

""I'm serious,"" I insisted, stepping closer. ""My sister was here last year. She drowned in this lake with her friends. The only survivor sent me a letter about things in the lake that came out when it rained. Please, just listen to me.""

My desperation must have shown through because some of their smiles faltered. Melissa bit her lip. ""Maybe we should go back. I didn't like the vibe of this place anyway.""

""Oh come on!"" the other girl exclaimed. ""We paid good money for this weekend. I'm not letting some random dude with a sob story ruin it.""

""Look, I'm not trying to scare you,"" I said. ""But something's not right here. The manager, the staff, they're hiding something. And my tires‚Ä¶""

""Your tires probably got punctured on the crappy road getting here,"" Jake interrupted. ""Happens all the time in these backwoods places.""

Thunder rumbled in the distance, a sound that made my blood run cold despite the clear sky above us.

""Weather's turning again,"" the tall guy noted, glancing at the horizon where dark clouds were gathering with unnatural speed. ""Maybe we should head in, just for a bit.""

Jake shook his head stubbornly. ""One quick dip. We'll be back before the rain hits.""

Before I could protest further, he was sprinting down the dock, the others following with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Jake dove in with a splash, followed by two others. Melissa and the tall guy hung back, watching from the edge.

""Come on, it feels amazing!"" Jake called, treading water.

I took a step back as The sky darkened with impossible speed. One moment clear, the next churning with black clouds. The distant thunder wasn't distant anymore, it cracked directly overhead, making the dock vibrate beneath my feet. The first drops fell,

""Jake, seriously, let's go!"" Melissa called, backing away from the edge. But something was happening to the lake. Where it had been glass-smooth moments before, now the surface rippled oddly, not from the rain or the swimmers, but from below. Concentric circles formed around the three in the water, as if something was rising toward them.

""You guys need to get out now!"" I yelled.

They reached the shore and were panting, but all okay apparently. They looked to each other and then the lake and started laughing.

‚ÄúAh man, nothing happened. Thought the Loch Ness Monster would come out to play or something with all the build up.‚Äù They continued laughing with only the girl named Melissa grimacing and looking around nervously. I watched the lake as the rain intensified and was disturbed by how the water began to roil, less like a lake more like an angry ocean.

The lake's surface began to churn violently, waves forming where there had been none before. The rain suddenly intensified, shifting from a gentle patter to a downpour in seconds.

A light in the distance cut through the darkness from somewhere behind me, sweeping across the shoreline. I raised my hand to shield my eyes as the powerful beam briefly illuminated me, casting my shadow long and distorted across the lake. The light was impossibly bright, like a searchlight but stronger, scanning methodically across the water's surface. Two sharp, piercing whistles sliced through the air, mechanical, like an old steam engine announcing its arrival. The sound echoed across the lake, reverberating in my chest.

""What the hell is that?"" one of the guys shouted, pointing toward the source of the light.

I turned to look, but the beam had already moved on, now sweeping across the turbulent surface of the lake. In its path, I could see something disturbing the water, not waves, but shapes moving beneath the surface, pale and elongated.

The group scrambled away from the shore, grabbing their belongings in a hurry. Through the increasing downpour, I noticed movement on the resort's main driveway, headlights cutting through the rain as several vehicles pulled away from the lodge, fleeing in haste.

""They're leaving us,"" I whispered, a cold dread settling in my stomach. ""The staff is evacuating, they know something is going to happen."" I considered the mysterious words about a sacrifice and my heart sank.

Before anyone could process what was happening, a red pickup truck with flashing emergency lights lurched down the path toward our position, its tires spraying mud and gravel. It skidded to a halt at the edge of the cove, and the driver's door swung open.

Mr. Dalton emerged, no longer the composed proprietor but a man possessed. His thin hair was plastered to his skull, his expensive suit soaked through. In his hand was something that looked like an antique lantern, its blue flame impossibly bright despite the rain.

""It happens faster every year, as if your cohort becomes increasingly less intelligent,"" he sneered with a chilling chuckle. ""Simple rules for simple minds. Honestly, if we made a rule stating that you would die if you didn't swim in the rain, your contrarian nature would probably guarantee that the Drowned ones would never wake again. Yet, here we find ourselves."" His eyes glinted with a sinister amusement as he sighed deeply, ""I fear you're all fresh out of luck.""

I couldn't process his words at first, they were too crazy, too detached from reality. But the cold calculation in his eyes told me this wasn't madness. It was something worse.

""What do you mean 'fresh out of luck'?"" the group's leader Jake demanded, stepping forward. ""What the hell is going on?""

Dalton ignored the chaos, focusing on me. ""You should've stayed in your room, Mr. Hanson. The lake is off-limits during rain, as I warned. Now you'll see what happened to your sister. The cycle continues. The lake must be fed. Die well."" With that, the truck sped off.

Terrible splashing footsteps echoed on the ground by the shore, like something heavy emerging, yet nothing was visible. Everyone froze in fear. Suddenly, a scream pierced the night, cut short as a girl was dragged across the wet ground, clawing at the earth. An unseen force, rain turned solid, pulled her toward the water.

""Help me!"" she cried, terror in her voice. Two men lunged, grabbing her wrists, forming a grim tug-of-war against the invisible pull.

""Don't let go!"" she sobbed, her eyes wild with fear.

But something was wrong with the rain where it touched her skin. It wasn't running off but collecting, thickening, taking form. Pale, elongated fingers materialized from the raindrops themselves, clutching at her legs, her waist, multiplying with each passing second.

Soon her scream was smothered by a rush of water forming from nothing over her head, drowning her on the edge of the water.

In the next moment the girl's body was pulled free from her attempted rescuers and she was yanked backward with impossible force. She didn't even have time to scream again before she was submerged, the lake swallowing her whole without a splash, as if she'd never existed at all.

""Jenny!"" her friends screamed in unison.

The remaining swimmers stood on the shore, their panicked screams barely audible over the hammering rain. I stood frozen, processing the horror of the situation. This was what happened to my sister. It wasn't an accident. It was a sacrifice.

""Run!"" I shouted to the others, finally breaking free of my paralysis. ""Get away from the water!""

But it was too late. The rain itself seemed to come alive, droplets coalescing mid-air into translucent shapes. One man was pulled off his feet by invisible forces, dragged through the mud as he screamed and clawed at the earth. Clinging to a tree trunk, his grip failed as rain shaped into fingers pried him loose.

""We have to get to the lodge!"" I yelled.

We sprinted through the rain, surrounded by translucent figures with featureless faces, water streaming from their elongated limbs as they moved toward us unnaturally. The lodge loomed ahead, dark and imposing against the storm-wracked sky. The front entrance stood partially open, swinging lazily in the wind. Not a single light burned inside.

""They're gone,"" the tall guy panted as we raced up the steps. ""Everyone's gone.""

We burst through the doors into the cavernous lobby. The reception desk was abandoned, drawers hanging open as if someone had left in a hurry. The elegant furniture that had seemed so welcoming earlier now cast grotesque shadows in the dim emergency lighting.

""We need to barricade the doors,"" I gasped, already shoving a heavy armchair toward the entrance. Melissa and the tall guy joined me, dragging a coffee table and an antique bench to block the way.

""I've got my car,"" Jake said suddenly, fumbling for his keys. ""It's right out front. If I can get to it, we can drive out of here!"" His eyes were wild with a desperate hope. ""I'll bring it around to the door. Be ready to jump in!""

Before I could stop him, he bolted toward a side exit, keys clutched in his trembling hand.

""Wait!"" I called after him, but he was already gone, the door slamming shut behind him.

Melissa and I pressed our faces to the window, watching as he sprinted through the downpour toward a blue sedan parked near the front steps. Splashing footsteps in the rain were appearing all around the building and parking lot with each passing second.

""Come on, come on,"" Melissa whispered, her breath fogging the glass.

The rain intensified and it became difficult to see anything outside. We pressed our ears to the glass and then recoiled when a disturbing scratching sound was heard on the other side of the door. It was followed by a voice out of a nightmare,

""Please... let us in,"" came a wet, gurgling voice from the other side of the door. The sound was unmistakably human yet horribly distorted, as if the speaker's lungs were filled with fluid. ""It's me... Jenny. I'm so cold... I can't breathe out here.""

Melissa stumbled backward, her hand flying to her mouth. ""That's her voice,"" she whispered. ""Oh God, that's Jenny's voice.""

""Help me,"" the voice pleaded, higher now, desperate. ""I'm drowning... please... it hurts so much.""

Water began seeping under the door, not in the usual way rain might trickle in, but purposefully, gathering into a puddle that crept across the floor toward us.

""Don't listen,"" I hissed, pulling Melissa farther back. ""That's not Jenny. Your friend is gone.""

A second voice joined the first, this one deeper but equally waterlogged. ""Sam... please... open the door. I can't... hold on much longer."" The voice choked and sputtered. ""The water... it's filling my lungs.""

""Matt?"" Melissa whispered, her face ashen. She took an involuntary step forward before I grabbed her arm.

""It's not them,"" I insisted, though my voice trembled. ""It's whatever took them. The same thing that took my sister.""

The frantic scratching grew louder against the walls and door. Tears streamed down Melisa's cheeks as she sobbed into her hands. Beside her, Sam gently comforted her with a soothing voice and embrace. Distracted by the unearthly voices pleading to be let in, we missed what was happening outside. Jake reached his car, the engine roared, and headlights pierced the darkness as he reversed.

For a moment, hope surged within me. The sedan backed up rapidly, aiming for the lodge entrance. If he could get close enough, we could make a run for it.

But something was wrong. The car was moving too fast, careening backward at a speed that suggested panic rather than control. Through the rain-streaked windshield, I could see the Jake was wrestling with the steering wheel, his face contorted in terror.

""Something's in there with him,"" I realized aloud, just as the sedan crashed through the barricade we'd erected, splintering the wooden barricade and shattering the lobby doors. Glass and splinters exploded across the marble floor as the vehicle smashed halfway into the building before grinding to a halt, its rear wheels still spinning.

""Jake!"" Melissa screamed, but her voice died in her throat as we saw what was happening inside the car.

The interior was filled with water, impossibly contained within the vehicle like an aquarium. Jake thrashed within, his mouth open in a silent scream, bubbles escaping his lips as he pounded against the windows. His eyes bulged, pleading for help we couldn't provide.

And then I saw them, the pale, elongated figures sharing the flooded car with him, their translucent hands wrapped around his throat, his ankles, his wrists. One of them turned toward us, a faceless head composed entirely of water, and I swear I saw a smile ripple across its featureless visage.

But worse than the horror inside the car was what was happening behind it. The rain creatures were flowing in through the shattered entrance, seeping around the sedan's frame and reforming inside the lobby. They moved with terrible purpose, water flowing upward against gravity to shape humanoid figures with long, reaching arms.

""Upstairs!"" I grabbed Melissa and Sam, yanking them toward the grand staircase. ""We need to get higher!""

We frantically clambered up the steps, the relentless splashing footsteps echoing behind us with a chilling consistency, never hastening or faltering, as inevitable and inescapable as death itself.

We reached the second floor landing, gasping for breath. The hallway stretched before us, doors lining both sides. Some stood ajar, inviting us into their deceptive safety.

""My room,"" I panted, pointing down the corridor. ""217. We can barricade ourselves in there.""

A flash of lightning illuminated the hallway through a large window at the end of the corridor. To my horror, the window was wide open, rain pouring in freely. The water wasn't behaving naturally , instead of simply splashing onto the floor, it gathered in midair, coalescing into those same terrible forms we'd seen outside.

""They're already inside,"" Melissa whispered, her voice breaking.

We looked behind us to see more water creatures ascending the stairs, their movements fluid yet somehow wrong, like stop-motion animation played at the wrong speed.

""Run!"" I shouted, pulling Melissa toward my room. Sam sprinted ahead of us, but as we passed the open window, a watery tendril shot out, wrapping around his ankle. He stumbled, crashing to the carpet.

""Help!"" he screamed, fingers clawing at the hallway runner as the tendril began dragging him back toward the window. I lunged for his outstretched hand, our fingers brushing for a split second before he was yanked away with impossible force.

""Sam!"" Melissa shrieked as he was pulled toward the open window, more tendrils materializing from the rain to envelop his body. His scream transformed into a choking gurgle as his head disappeared beneath the watery surface.

""We can't help him!"" I shouted, watching in horror as Sam's struggling form was enveloped in water that seemed to materialize from nowhere, covering him.

We made it to her room and slammed and locked the door. I ensured the windows were closed and barricaded the door. We sat in terrified silence as the horrifying sounds of the things outside pressed inwards.

Melissa collapsed onto the floor, trembling and sobbing uncontrollably as the reality of what had happened to her friends sank in. I checked the bathroom for any water source, relieved to find the taps dry when I turned them. Small mercies.

""What are those things?"" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the pounding rain outside. ""This can't be happening.""

The scratching began at our door, soft at first, then more insistent. Water seeped beneath the doorframe, forming a small puddle that began to grow despite our attempts to block it with towels.

The voices called, a horrible chorus of drowned friends. ""We found something amazing in the lake. You have to see it. Please let us in.""

Melissa pressed her hands over her ears, rocking back and forth. ""Make it stop,"" she begged. ""Please make it stop.""

We waited, helpless in the room for what felt like hours. None of the things got in, but we could not get out. Then the sound of the rain stopped. The ghoulish voices begging us to let them in stopped as well.

It was the rain! I remembered what the letter said, they came with the rain. We had to take our chance and leave now.

""We're leaving,"" I said, my voice stronger than I felt. ""Now.""

Melissa looked up at me with red-rimmed eyes. ""But what if they're waiting? What if...""

""If we stay here, we die,"" I cut her off, gripping her shoulders. ""The rain's stopped. Those things... they come with the rain. That's what happened to my sister.""

I moved to the window and peered outside. The storm had broken The lake gleamed under the dull shades of the coming dawn.

""We need to get to a car,"" I said. ""Any car.""

""Jake's is still downstairs,"" Melissa whispered, pushing herself to her feet. Her face was pale but determined.

We crept to the door, listening for any sounds beyond. Nothing but silence greeted us. I turned the handle slowly, wincing at the slight creak as the door swung open. The hallway was empty. Not just of water creatures, but of any trace they'd been there at all.

We moved cautiously down the stairwell.

""I don't understand,"" Melissa whispered as we reached the first floor. ""How can everything be normal?""

The lobby told a different story. Jake's car remained half-embedded in the shattered entrance, a grim reminder that not everything had been reset. But the vehicle was empty, no water, no Jake, just the keys still dangling from the ignition.

""Let's go,"" I said, moving toward the car.

Melissa hesitated. ""Shouldn't we look for the others? Maybe they're still alive somewhere.""

I shook my head, remembering Laura, remembering Tim's letter. ""They're gone. If we stay, we'll be gone too.""

The car's engine sputtered to life on the first try. I reversed it carefully over the broken glass and splintered wood. As we pulled away from the lodge, I glanced in the rearview mirror. The building loomed dark and silent, its windows reflecting the faint light of the rising sun like empty eyes. We drove down the winding road through the forest, both too traumatized to speak at first.

""I'm so sorry about your sister,"" Melissa finally said, her voice small in the confined space

I nodded absently, my knuckles white on the steering wheel. ""I just wish I knew what really happened to her. If those things took her like they took your friends.""

The words died in my throat as a single drop of water hit the windshield. Then another. And another.

""No,"" Melissa whispered, her eyes widening in terror. ""Not again.""

Rain began to pelt the car, increasing in intensity with unnatural speed. I pressed my foot to the accelerator, the sedan lurching forward on the narrow road.

""Faster!"" Melissa urged, twisting in her seat to look behind us.

I heard it then, the unmistakable sound of splashing footsteps keeping pace with the car. Not on the road, but somehow beside us, within the curtain of rain itself.

""Connor‚Ä¶""

My blood froze. It was Laura's voice, clear as day, coming from just outside my window.

""Connor, why are you leaving me?"" The voice was perfectly my sister's, yet horribly distorted, as if she were speaking through water. ""I've been so alone.""

""Don't listen,"" Melissa warned, her hands pressed against her ears. ""It's not her.""

But I couldn't help myself. I glanced toward my window and saw a pale face formed in the rain, Laura's face, her features rippling and flowing but unmistakably hers. Water streamed from her hair, her eyes, her mouth as she clung to the car, impossible yet undeniable.

""Please, Connor‚Ä¶I'm drowning‚Ä¶help me."" Her watery fingers pressed against the glass, leaving no marks yet somehow I could feel the chill of her touch through the window.

I swerved, nearly sending us off the road. The tires skidded on the wet asphalt as I struggled to keep control.

""Don't look at it!"" Melissa screamed, but her eyes were fixed on her own window where Matt's face had formed in the rain, his features twisted in agony.

The windshield wipers worked frantically, slicing through the apparitions only for them to reform instantly. Laura's voice grew more desperate, more insistent.

""You promised you'd always protect me‚Ä¶why did you leave me here? I'm so cold‚Ä¶so dark under the water.""

My chest constricted with grief and guilt. ""I'm sorry,"" I whispered, tears blurring my vision. ""I'm so sorry, Laura.""

""Pull over,"" her voice coaxed, sweet and terrible. ""Just stop the car. Let me in. We can be together again.""

For a heartbeat, my foot hovered over the brake pedal. The longing to see my sister again, to speak with her one last time, was overwhelming.

""Connor, don't!"" Melissa's hand clamped down on my arm. ""It's not her! Remember what happened to the others!""

The spell broke. I stomped on the accelerator and eventually the voices receded as well as the rain.

My sister was gone, what was left there was not her. Melissa and I made our way back to what we believed was safety, but I recalled Tim and his survival and realized we would never really be safe again. Those creatures had marked us, and they would relentlessly pursue us. The rain, once a simple part of nature, had transformed into a constant harbinger of our impending doom.



That was all two months ago. Melissa and I stayed in touch after our escape from Lake Kashur, bound by a trauma no one else could understand. The official report blamed a flash flood that claimed her friends, another tragic accident like Laura‚Äôs.

I tried to explain what really happened, rain forming into people, drowned voices, and a proprietor who fled, leaving his guests as sacrifices, but it sounded insane. They offered grief counseling and quietly closed the case.

I‚Äôve spent hours researching Lake Kashur. Ownership records reveal a history of ‚Äútragic accidents,‚Äù yet Gregory Dalton‚Äôs name is missing, as if he never existed. The most disturbing find was a 1937 newspaper clipping showing Dalton at the resort‚Äôs opening ceremony, unchanged by time, looking exactly like he did when I saw him in person.

I had no idea who or what he really is and I don‚Äôt know if I will ever know.

Tonight, it is raining again. Even with the blinds drawn, I hear the voices, splashing footsteps, and fingernails scratching at the glass. Melissa calls these episodes ‚Äúhauntings‚Äù, fitting since the dead spirits will never give us peace.

Now, as the relentless rain pounds on every sealed entry, my phone buzzes. Melissa whispers, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre outside my building, I can hear them calling, Matt, Jenny, everyone.‚Äù I tell her to stay put and follow our safety plan. Even so, the hauntings grow more relentless, and I fear I may not last much longer. I fear I will never be free, from this drowning cycle of death.",1,1745970273.0,u_BadandyTheRed,0,1.0,False

1kb2flt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1kb2flt/anxiety_about_pooping/,Anxiety about pooping,"Hi. I am 24M suffering from anxiety about pooping for 2.5 years now. At first it was unconscious, it basically manifested on the way to work and i needed to go to the toilet as quickly as possible. However, this last year it has become much more frequent and manifests in two situations :
- first one is when I am taking public transports, Subway, buses etc ( I have a 45 minutes transport to work everyday)
- second one is basically when I am stuck somewhere and can't get out, for example i used to watch kids during exams and could not leave the room, and it happened a lot of times.
I am now aware that those episodes are panic attacks, the thing is the more i think about worrying about pooping myself the more i want to poop, its like a vicious circle.
I have tried many things, cutting Coffee in the morning, no alcool or smoking, nothing spicy etc etc, it stil happens.

At this point it really affects my mental health and it has grown into an obsession. I have to mention that it only happens in the morning.

Sorry for the essay, I could really use some help here as I feel very alone.

Cheers

I struggle to make friends with other moms at the park or the library. I'm the weird blue haired mom, and I suck at small talk. My kid throws a fit when it's time to leave, I look like the asshole because I'm making her, even after giving her ample warning. The tantrum continues on the way home, now the baby is crying too. We are phasing out of naps, so the days are incredibly long. And by the time my husband is done working, it's time to cook dinner, bathe children, bedtime routine. We get maybe an hour or two alone at night, it's hardly sufficient. He's a great dad, and I know he is trying, but it's taking a toll on him too. A recession is coming and I feel like there's no end in sight. Ugh. ",1,1745969820.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1kb2d37,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kb2d37/they_call_it_the_house_of_graves/,They Call It The House of Graves,"My house was new to me, old by any other aspect. Where we moved to, old equaled cheap, and as a former self-emancipated teen and current broke adult, cheap was almost too much to afford.  
  
I‚Äôm grateful that my friends helped me with the move. When I‚Äôd left my parents‚Äô house for the last time, I took nothing but what could fit in a bag, the clothes on my back, and the money I‚Äôd earned through back breaking work at the factory my father had worked for over thirty years. The old man would‚Äôve noticed if I‚Äôd taken anything more and being discreet was the only reason I got out of there without getting pummeled all over my scrawny body. Or worse. But maybe nothing is worse than the desert town called Halliton.

Far away from any family, far away from most things, was Halliton. It was a Southward drive shy of an hour down into Santa Fe, where my new community college classes were, but far enough to feel alone in the world. The place, despite being so rural, felt like a literal oasis at the end of those absurdly long stretches of roads we took there in our cars, loaded up with stuff. I didn‚Äôt have much, never had. My friends ‚Äì Rebecca, Martin, and Raul ‚Äì agreed to help me take my stuff from my shitty old apartment and into Raul‚Äôs truck.

Before we moved, the four of us sat around my last apartment, eating Chinese food and watching some movie, when Raul said something we all resonated with, ‚ÄúWe need to get out of fucking Oklahoma.‚Äù

That was all it took.

The houses around Harrow Hill road were spaced far apart, as it was with these older places. I‚Äôd been in a few towns like this when I lived in Oklahoma, usually near or in the woods. By the time we arrived on our property, it was after 10pm. The house loomed over us, feeling taller, larger in the dark. The windows were blacker than the night sky, and from even outside you could hear the occasional creaking and groaning of the house settling, like an old widow, perched on her hill, moving through the pains of time going by too fast around her.¬†

A two bedroom with a finished attic was somehow cheaper than anything else on the market, and I‚Äôd eventually understand why.

‚ÄúWarner,‚Äù Rebecca called for me at the top of the stairs within the first five minutes we started bringing boxes in. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre all right with the loft? I mean, I know it makes sense for Martin and I to take it, but the thought of going up and down the stairs to check on the baby on the way, not to mention morning sickness. And it doesn‚Äôt have a lot of space to put your paint and easel‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay with putting all that in the basement.‚Äù I told her matter-of-factly.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even finished.‚Äù She insisted.

‚ÄúWell, would you rather me get oil paint all over carpet, tile, or hardwood floor?‚Äù

Her mouth drifted open as she considered it. ‚ÄúGuess you gotta point.‚Äù

‚ÄúRare, I know.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs, like, super cool of you, by the way. To give us the master bedroom.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you are two, almost three people occupying one space. You'll probably want your own bathroom. Hard to argue with the math.‚Äù

It took three, maybe four hours to get all our stuff inside the house, and by the time we got our mattresses in our respective rooms, none of us felt like unpacking anything beyond some pillows and blankets to make it through the night. We put together our cash and ‚Äúnose go‚Äôd‚Äù that Martin would be the designated pickup of pizza and beer. He gave Becca a peck on the lips before heading out into the harsh winter cold with that ugly gray scarf of his.

Rebecca and Martin had been practically married for about ten years, but as high school sweethearts who had recently turned 20 (Martin) and 21 (Rebecca) they were only married on paper for about two. I met them in grade school, and we were recess friends. You know, usually the kind of kid from another class, another grade, or someone you just never talked to in your own class for some reason. We reconnected together while working an old job at a restaurant.

‚ÄúI think Monica‚Äôs into me,‚Äù Raul got himself a glass of water from the kitchen. He must have had the forethought to put some utensils and stuff in place at some point. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs long distance, but I think we can make it work. I‚Äôll make enough at this new job to pay for flights back and forth.‚Äù

Raul I met in high school. He popped a guy in the gut at a concert for some metalcore Linkin Park ripoff band for breaking my nose after I bumped into his beer hand. Nothing bound two guys together as brothers more than escorting the other over their shoulder to the hospital three blocks away. We couldn‚Äôt have learned more about one another that night than if we got piss-pantsing drunk in a parking lot past 11am, one of few pastimes in our old Midwest town.

‚ÄúAnd you assume this because‚Ä¶?‚Äù Becks arched a brow as he went back for more glasses for the two of us.

‚ÄúShe kept rubbing my shoulder when we clocked in together in the office, and I‚Äôd caught her checking my pecs once or twice before my last day before going remote.‚Äù

‚ÄúTotally a litmus test for any successful relationship.‚Äù

‚ÄúFeh. Monica‚Äôs not one for *relationships*, and I think I‚Äôm okay with that. After Daisy cheated on me I‚Äôm kind of over searching for love. I just want to have fun.‚Äù

It was so obvious that Rebecca didn‚Äôt agree with that mindset. Neither of us expected she might. I‚Äôd been single my whole life at that point, not even a wishy-washy middle school girlfriend. I mean, I‚Äôd once gotten one of those rubber bracelets from a girl in my calc class, which gave me the butterflies, but seconds later got told she‚Äôd apparently smoked a joint before fifth period and was making them for everyone. Thus were the breaks in one‚Äôs teen years.

It didn‚Äôt matter to me, though. I was too busy keeping my nose to the grindstone while working on a degree in engineering and soon looking for a job. Last month, before moving, I was working at a family restaurant with Mart and Becca, which was kinda nice, but also not sustainable. I kept falling behind on job duties due to all-nighters studying and trying to maintain at least some hobbies. Like painting.

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was particularly good. Friends praised me, but I‚Äôve never bothered to submit a portfolio or attend art fairs. Painting was exclusively for me. A skill and pastime all my own that no one could take away. It‚Äôs nice to have things like that, to have one thing that makes you feel whole. I still like painting despite all that‚Äôs happened.

Martin returned with food and and a six pack like a knight showing up to save the day, and with an empty belly I particularly felt like a damsel in distress. Men could be damsels too, given the right circumstances. Rebecca, of course, had sparkling water instead. Three beautiful, greasy slices and two cheap beers later, and I was more than ready for bed. Martin and Rebecca were too, but in a different sort of way.

‚ÄúKeep the boinking sounds to a minimum when Warner and I are home, you spouses.‚Äù Raul stood up from the floor with a groan and a symphony of cracking from his back. Our sounds would be the same once we stood. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to crash so hard, glad I don‚Äôt start work until Monday.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe, too.‚Äù Martin and Rebecca agreed.

I wasn‚Äôt so lucky, but I was used to going to class and working in all conditions at the community college I just transferred credits from. I had qualified for a partial scholarship at my new college, but the usual academic fuckery messed with getting me full grants for some reason, so I still owed half the tuition myself. I planned to spend all of tomorrow in Halliton looking for something that worked with my day classes.

I flopped onto my classes, dreading the early morning of registering for Santa Fe Community College and all the tedious paperwork that would follow.

‚Ä¶

I found work pretty easily at the Gas n‚Äô Get, the gas station convenience store near the edge of town. It was perfect, the overnight shift let me get to my classes in Santa Fe and back home in time to rest up before heading into work. Only my first shift in, and I knew pretty much the ins and outs. My boss, Frank, was laidback and the register was relatively automated for such a rural town.

That weekend, we had our first welcome at our house's front door. He was an older guy, I‚Äôd say fifties or sixties, judging by his graying roots and salt and pepper beard. His puffer vest over a long sleeve flannel and worn hunter‚Äôs canvas pants combo was sort of ageless in its own way, so it was hard to nail down what range of age he was. I grinned politely at him, more of a lips pulling back into an awkward line sort of expression. Pure Midwest behavior.

‚ÄúHi, the name‚Äôs Daniel Spritcher. So, you‚Äôre the new neighbors. I met Mr. Perez before, but not you.‚Äù He meant Raul. He offered his hand, and I shook it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your landlord.‚Äù

He laughed as though it were obvious, but as Raul was the one who found the place and did most of the paperwork, the most the three of us had to do was sign the lease. Raul had plenty of flexibility to do all that as he worked virtually and had the free time to get us set up. He‚Äôd found our house for cheap, and the rest worked itself out from there.

‚ÄúOh! Wow. Uh. Thanks for the intro,‚Äù I said awkwardly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Warner, by the way. Are you just stopping by to say hello, or is there something I can help you with?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe wife and I live down the road, ‚Äòbout a couple football fields distance that way,‚Äù he pointed eastward. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre welcome to stop by for a cold one if we‚Äôre out back on a weekend night. Just built a new firepit for the backyard. Make helluva smores.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a kind offer, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe saw you moving in, Wanda and I, and, thing is‚Ä¶‚Äù The old man scratched his neck, already raw from other scratches. I tried not to stare. ‚ÄúYoung people, moving somewhere like this, we wonder if‚Ä¶I know you won‚Äôt volunteer the truth when I ask this if it‚Äôs true, but are you four in some kind of trouble? Running from someone? The law?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, God no.‚Äù I balked and waved my hands quickly. ‚ÄúNo, uh, we‚Äôre just looking for a fresh start.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot the first I‚Äôve heard of something like that, but almost never for our town. Guess I should have suspected that when I listed the house online after the last ones rented. Thought I‚Äôd try to keep up with the times. Listen, this is driving me crazy. Sorry, if this is awkward, but the more we talk‚Ä¶‚Äù More scratching, a little more aggressive. ‚ÄúI recognize you, somehow. You ever been around here before?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, sir."" I was taken a bit aback by the question. ""First time here.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight, right. I remember Raul mentioning that. Never lived nearby? I used to substitute at a high school in Pecos.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôve all lived in the west edge of Oklahoma our whole lives. I worked the graveyard shift at the Gas n‚Äô Get last night, first day, maybe you saw me there?‚Äù Though I thought I would have recognized him if that were the case, there was no accounting for memory issues.

‚ÄúStrange. Graveyard shift, you said? No, I was most surely in bed by that time. Well, nice meeting you. Offer still stands for free beer and good company, maybe pizza from Andretti's on Wren Street ‚Äì you *are* old enough to drink, right?‚Äù He asked quickly.

‚ÄúFor a couple years,‚Äù I laughed.

‚ÄúGood, know you guys like beer. A six pack and pizza always hits the spot.‚Äù

I furrowed my brow a little at that, amused how accurate he was about move-in night. Were twenty-somethings easy to clock as still having their college tastes?  
  
""Well, be seeing ya.""

He nodded and left, pulling the collar of his vest up to his ears as the winds blew sharper with the coming night.

‚Ä¶

Weeks went by, and I was well into the groove of working the graveyard shift. I left there to go to my only class that morning, and I finally returned home around 11am.

Have you ever had the feeling of knowing someone is home, even if you‚Äôre on your own in another room and everything's quiet? I wondered if that was tied to the human animal‚Äôs sense of surviving predators in prehistoric times. The knowing one's being watched. Some leftover primal instinct embedded in our DNA.

The only car parked around the house was my own. Unlikely anyone but me was home. I tried to shake it, but I ended up sleeping on the sofa. New place jitters. I hadn‚Äôt lived in a house in about five years, and assumed it was the size, the emptiness, that got to me.

I dicked around on my phone for a few before putting on some podcast to fall asleep to. I‚Äôm the kind of person that can‚Äôt sleep without noise. As I was falling asleep, I heard someone loudly moving overhead, but was too close to dreaming to wake up.  
  
Then someone *was* home, but how? Did one of the three walk home? Did Martin drop off Rebecca, or the reverse? Whoever it was went down the stairs, then back up, then down again, then back up. They were clearly searching through everything, there was so much thumping that I was sure they‚Äôd retrieved something huge from their room. Outrageously loud. I sat up and was rightfully annoyed.

‚ÄúWho the fuck is up there?‚Äù I called loud enough to reach upstairs.

No answer.  I figured it was Raul. I‚Äôd seen him leave earlier with his backpack. And I'd recognized the smell of his outrageously expensive cologne. As Raul‚Äôs remote in coding, he preferred to work at libraries and coffee shops for ambient noise. The only options he‚Äôd have in this town were a small library, a few coffee shops, a diner, or a couple little bar restaurants that seemed reserved for nicer meals out. Ermaline‚Äôs, where Becca and Martin had just been happily brought onto staff with.

I was about to come up the stairs when Raul came down, in a major hurry.

‚ÄúHey, man ‚Äì‚Äù He brushed past me, cutting me off.

He made a sort of grunt in replacement of a real greeting or answer, and went out the door with a slam. In hindsight, despite going upstairs he had nothing in his hands. All that heavy thumping and dragging, things falling, and nothing to show for it? For that matter, why had he come home? *How* had he come home? Did he really walk back? Park down the road for some reason?

Despite these questions, I didn‚Äôt bother to check if he had driven in or what. If he‚Äôd taken even a minute to talk to me, I might have offered him a ride back into town. I went back to the couch, fuming at how rudely I‚Äôd been awoken. Despite my rage, I somehow fell asleep.

I woke to the sound of Mart and Becks coming home, laughing and taking off their coats. They, at least, had the decency to look ashamed when they‚Äôd realized they‚Äôd woken me up.

‚ÄúHey, guys.‚Äù I rubbed my tired eyes.

‚ÄúHey, bud, get enough sleep?‚Äù Martin was always concerned about my irregular sleep patterns, a real health nut.

‚ÄúAbout six hours. I only had one class today.‚Äù I stretched and stood up. Only 5 o‚Äôclock, and it was already pitch black outside, but that wasn‚Äôt surprising for winter. ‚ÄúHow was work?‚Äù

‚ÄúMonotony.‚Äù Martin answered bluntly. ""Can't wait to rent a spot to open a practice.""

Martin had formal training in holistic chiropracting. A little pretentious, but at least he was helpful, not pushy about supplements and whatever.

‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre meeting a lot of people! Great tips when it‚Äôs the biggest restaurant in town.‚Äù Rebecca said happily. ‚ÄúSpeaking of! We brought home baked ziti for dinner. Hungry?‚Äù

Of course I was. We were near finished with the meal when Raul came home, and I remembered the cold shoulder he‚Äôd left with after he rampaged upstairs. When he came into the dining room, I put my fork down a little more forcefully than I should have. This caught his attention.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I looked up at him with annoyance, and he was taken aback. ‚ÄúWhat was up with this afternoon? All that, and you wouldn‚Äôt say two words to me? Are you angry at me or something?‚Äù

He furrowed his brow. ‚ÄúWhat are you on about? This afternoon?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou went upstairs, you started moving things around, dropping things. Woke me up with it and left after grunting at me like some douchebag.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù Martin spoke up, hand up in a gesture for me to pull back. ‚ÄúWarn, you got it all wrong.‚Äù ‚ÄúReally? Seemed pretty clear to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúBud,‚Äù Raul kept looking at me as if I were a stranger. ‚ÄúI never came back home today.‚Äù

That didn‚Äôt compute in my brain. ‚ÄúDude, there‚Äôs no way, I *saw* you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Rebecca spoke up. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs true, War. He was at the restaurant all day.‚Äù

I struggled to piece that together with the reality I‚Äôd experienced. It was absolutely Raul. I‚Äôd seen him, smelled his cologne in the air, he‚Äôd brushed against my shoulder as he‚Äôd left. But, I mean, I was asleep when he‚Äôd supposedly come home. It was *possible* I‚Äôd dreamt it, but still.

‚ÄúLook, have you been upstairs?‚Äù Raul offered.

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù I hesitated. ‚ÄúI went back to sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, if I was doing what you said, it would probably be a mess, somewhere. Let‚Äôs go upstairs and check it out.‚Äù

I followed him up the stairs. First, to the right, the hall bathroom. Nothing, everything in order. Then the master bedroom. Everything was intact, but frankly it didn‚Äôt seem Raul‚Äôs style to tear up someone else‚Äôs space. Next was his room. Same as last night when we‚Äôd played Xbox together, everything but his blankets were in their usual place.

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù Raul said with finality. ‚ÄúNow will you drop it? You‚Äôre weirding me out, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù I rubbed the back of my neck, confusion making my head spin. ‚ÄúYeah. I mean, yeah. I‚Äôm sorry. I guess it was just a dream, or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúSleepwalking,‚Äù Martin offered. ‚ÄúYour sleep hygiene has been all over the place. Maybe you‚Äôre still adjusting to the new sleep schedule.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight, yeah. But, just to be sure, let‚Äôs check my room?‚Äù

‚ÄúHold on, you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd fuck with your stuff? As, what, a prank?‚Äù

I was already up the stairs by the time he‚Äôd asked. My heart thudded in my chest, not just from the sprint upward.

‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù Raul joined, and Martin came up the stairs to peer around him. ‚ÄúWait, hold the fuck on, I *did not* do this!‚Äù

My room was trashed. My bedding was all rumpled, half on the floor, pillows scattered around. My drawers were rifled through, clothes tossed haphazardly in the direction of the door, even my curtain rod was pulled from the window.

‚ÄúRaul!‚Äù I was livid, I started getting to work cleaning, beginning with the curtain rod, but I was so frustrated I ended up fumbling with it and just threw it to the floor. ‚ÄúWhy the fuck would you do this?‚Äù

‚ÄúI swear I didn‚Äôt!‚Äù He had his hands over his chest, eyes wide and wild. ‚ÄúI was gone all day, dude!‚Äù

Martin put himself between me and Raul with clear intention to diffuse the coming fight between us. Truly a future dad skill coming into play, stopping a childish fight.

‚ÄúStop. Obviously *someone* came inside the house. Or‚Ä¶I mean, it‚Äôs possible that you might have been asleep but still moving, Warner‚Ä¶‚Äù The silence filled in the blanks on his thought process.

‚ÄúNo way, I was not sleep walking! I ‚Äì I woke up in the same position I fell asleep in! My phone in my hand, earbuds plugged into the charge port.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf someone did come in, why was the door unlocked?‚Äù Rebecca asked from the bottom of the stairs.

‚ÄúThey probably used the key under the mat,‚Äù Raul ran his hand over his face. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need to find a new spot for it, it‚Äôs the most obvious place anyone could hide one. I just didn‚Äôt think it would be an issue in a town like this. Should we report this?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere wouldn‚Äôt be much they can do‚Ä¶‚Äù Martin thought a moment as I stuffed things back into the drawers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go into town tomorrow and get one of those video doorbells. It doesn‚Äôt fix much tonight, but we‚Äôll bring the spare key inside, make sure the doors and windows are locked, and make it work 'til morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù Rebecca started freaking out downstairs. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this is happening. We *just* moved here.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one took anything,‚Äù I answered with finality. ‚ÄúMy watches, my silver chain, my gaming stuff. It‚Äôs all here. Maybe I was sleepwalking. Or‚Ä¶I dunno. Something happened. Martin‚Äôs right. We‚Äôll get a camera. Could‚Äôve been some idiot punk kids. No one comes back to mess with us. I‚Äôll talk to the landlord.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve met him?‚Äù Raul asked as Martin went downstairs to comfort his wife.

‚ÄúYeah, the other day. Seems like a nice guy. Lives down the road about five minute‚Äôs walk away, he said.‚Äù

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt hurt to bring it up.‚Äù Raul stress sighed. ‚ÄúWarner, I‚Äôm sorry. This really sucks. I‚Äôd never do this to you, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I ran a hand through my hair. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just make sure everything is locked. You guys get some sleep while I‚Äôm at work.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell Barb I say hi,‚Äù Martin chuckled. The stories I‚Äôd told about my favorite regular could fill a book, and I‚Äôd only been working at Gas ‚Äòn Get for about a month.

‚Ä¶



That night, the gas station shift was going by like normal. I actually liked the overnight shift. It paid hella well for what it was, and I was sort of enjoying the zen of stocking shelves with nothing but the sound of humming refrigerators and the occasional trucker making a snack or piss run before heading out on the road. I‚Äôd probably like being a truck driver, if it weren‚Äôt for the fact I was determined to get that degree.

Cohan, a regular who showed up around two AM most nights in his eighteen wheeler, and always bought out the Corn Nuts from their peg. I hated those things, but he said they went well with his smokes, of which he bought two packs of as well. Who was I to hate on someone‚Äôs road snacks? He was a big guy, the quiet type. He was the kind of guy who concealed carried but in a comforting way, the sort to put you behind him before he pulled the trigger.

I was busying myself refilling the Corn Nuts that Cohan had bought out when Barb came in. Sometimes I wondered if she sat out in the parking lot to wait for the store to be empty.

‚ÄúHey, hey, Warner.‚Äù She greeted in that gravelly country accent of hers.

‚ÄúEvening, Barb. How‚Äôs the weather on the roads like?‚Äù Being a notch up into the mountains, a winter night here could sometimes drop down to the bitter cold of a Midwest winter day, still bitter and cutting.

‚ÄúIf I had any balls they‚Äôd be puckered up and fallen off frozen,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúTrucks don‚Äôt hold no heat, even the newfangled ones. Looked at the forecast and read my cards, clear skies all the way through the weekend. Not like we‚Äôve really had snow around here in years.‚Äù

I wanted her to be right, and usually she was. She and her Tarot cards were more accurate about things past, present, and future than any hackneyed psychic could ever be.

Honestly, Barb was just flat out cool. She sported a jet black bob hairstyle (which I frankly thought was a wig) that contrasted starkly against her pale skin. Her clothes and accessories were straight out of a hippie stoner‚Äôs dream wardrobe. Crystals hung on hemp and rope around her neck, dreamcatcher earrings dangled from the sides of her head, and rings of all kinds of stones adorned nearly every finger. She was a time capsule of the 70s.

Old enough to be my grandma, but her arms were scattered with tattoos. God, I wanted her to *be* my grandma.

Despite being just about five foot tall, she was able to knock back enough Red Bull in a night to put me to shame. She‚Äôd pulled a few flavors by the time I met her at the register. Those, plus a packet of snack cakes were her usual purchase of choice. We kept up our typical kind of conversation, until she said something that struck me.

‚ÄúYou smell all kinds of wrong.‚Äù

I cringed. Guess I should have showered before I‚Äôd come in, and the smell of sweat lingered on me as if I‚Äôd just come in from the rain. Then I squinted.

‚ÄúWrong?‚Äù It was such an odd way to phrase someone‚Äôs bodily smell. ‚ÄúHow do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúStrange,‚Äù she added, with absolutely no clarification. ‚ÄúSomething new happened.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt a question, which unnerved me.

‚ÄúUh,‚Äù my tongue flicked over my lower lip in thought. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know, everything is the same as it has been for a while. School, home, work. Rinse and repeat.‚Äù

‚ÄúToday. Something happened today.‚Äù

I laughed, used to her eccentricities. She‚Äôd recently offered me a genuine rabbit's foot to pass an assignment, which I borrowed (in a plastic baggie), and passed, but that was based purely on how much work I‚Äôd put into studying. When I‚Äôd returned it, she rubbed salt over it and put it back into its original cloth satchel.

Realization killed my laughter, though.

‚ÄúI guess. Yeah, something happened.‚Äù

I told her about earlier that day. How I‚Äôd been asleep and ended up feeling like I was going crazy so soon after I‚Äôd woken up. I‚Äôd tried to put it behind me all night while working, focusing my energy on the moment instead of my mind. I was pretty good at that. I knew a lot of people had a problem with clearing out thoughts to meditate, but I never really had that problem. If anything, the whole head emptying thing was almost a problem of its own.

‚ÄúYou ever sleepwalked before?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúNot to my knowledge.‚Äù

‚ÄúMmmm‚Ä¶‚Äù The sound was grainy coming from behind her closed, thin lips. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs bad news. Doubt it‚Äôs sleepwalking. Could‚Äôve been, of course, but ain't very likely if you never experienced it before. Mind if I read my cards?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou keep them on you all the time?‚Äù I arched a brow as she pulled them from her purse.

‚ÄúThey work good when they soak up my vibrations.‚Äù 

Okay. Made total sense. I think.

She pulled a cigarette from her bag and held it between her lips as she rifled for her Tarot deck. By the time she pulled them out, her pink lipstick smudged up half the cigarette and smeared a little onto the skin around her mouth.

‚ÄúThere we go. Let me shuffle 'em.‚Äù

She set the box down on the counter and started maneuvering the cards as smoothly as a dealer at a casino. In a way, Tarot card reading kind of felt like gambling; hoping for a good hand, wanting the results to be just the pull you‚Äôd need to fulfill your desires. She had me pull three from a handful of ten, took them back, and laid them out face up. The only one I could recognize was The Tower, the other two were sort of faded, probably from years of use.

Barb gnawed gently on the butt of her cigarette.

‚ÄúUpside down,‚Äù she tapped The Tower with the back of her knuckle. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs off. Obstacles, bit o' misfortune in the air, coming hard times. This one,‚Äù she tapped on another, ‚ÄúFive of swords. Means someone‚Äôs working to get ahead by any means necessary. Foul motives. Lastly. The Hanged Man.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat one sounds kind of not great,‚Äù I grit my teeth.

‚ÄúIt means sacrifice, dying to oneself and one‚Äôs needs for a necessary change. Misfortune, misdeed, martyrdom. The intention for this reading was for revelation, now it‚Äôs time for interpretation. Want to try first? Often, the one read to can have more insight than the deck dealer.‚Äù

I considered it a moment. This was Barb‚Äôs best ability, that she could convince even a stout skeptic for even one minute to consider her mysticism as possible. I never considered myself a skeptic or believer, but Barb was closest to pulling me to one side over the other.

‚ÄúFoul motives, I have no clue about. Obstacles, difficulty, maybe balancing both work and school?‚Äù

‚ÄúA bit shallow.‚Äù Barb muttered, and I felt judged, which egged me on to try again.

‚ÄúWhat happened today‚Ä¶‚Äù I ventured. ‚ÄúMight happen again. Or be the first of something. I should ask Mr. Spritcher about it tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpritcher?‚Äù Barb echoed. ‚ÄúWhy him?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs our landlord.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, God.‚Äù Barb closed her eyes, the butt of the unlit cigarette now squished between her teeth. ‚ÄúI should have put two and two to make four. There‚Äôs just so many houses up for rent as the youngers move out for big cities. It‚Äôs that house on Harrow Hill?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess it figures he wouldn‚Äôt have said anything, that weasel Spritcher. He bought up that property six, seven years ago and has been renting it out ever since.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds kind of standard?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one sticks around there for long. Even before that idiot bought it, it had a reputation. Kid, if you talk to almost anyone in town over the age of fifty, they could tell you all about that place. Its history. What we know of it, at least.‚Äù

‚ÄúIts history?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyone who‚Äôs lived there ends up leaving. Whether because they pass in the house, someone else passes away inside, or they just‚Ä¶disappear. Warner, it‚Äôs a house that has its own name and it‚Äôs earned it for good reason.‚Äù

My throat was stuck, thick, gluey. ‚ÄúAnd that name is?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey call it The House of Graves.‚Äù

I lay awake that morning, no classes. Thinking, thinking, thinking. I thought about Mr. Spritcher. About Barb. The house. God, the house. And Raul, what happened last afternoon.

I couldn't blame Spritcher for not divulging the track record of the tenancy. Who would want to live in a place that couldn't hold onto a renter under those questionable, and alarming, circumstances? And Barb, what she told me about the house itself, her insane accuracy on all things metaphysical. And Raul. I ran that interaction, that bizarre moment, the inexplicable outcome, all over and over in my head.

I curled up onto my side, face in my hands as I tried to think. Any detail, any extra scrap, a thread of remembrance to pull things together and make it all make sense.

Then, it struck me.

Through the veil of sleep, either the sleep of that afternoon, or the one that overtook me in the moment, I saw it. Clear as someone standing before me. Clear as a voice right in my ear. Unmistakable as if someone called my name. Somehow, it had blotted from my mind, smeared away from the canvas of my memory like oil paint with a painter's palette knife.

It *was* Raul.

1kb27un,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allergies/comments/1kb27un/stomach_cramps_but_only_at_work/,"Stomach cramps, but only at work","This is a bit of a weird one, but I can't find anything on Google about this.

I've noticed recently in my last few shifts at work I've been getting really bad stomach cramps. It's not the kind where I can just take pain killers and let it pass; it's unbearable, stomach doing summersaults and knotting a million times over, could double over and throw up any second kind of pains. 

The thing is, it only happens at work, and fades away within an hour or two of leaving the premises. At first I thought it was IBS but the fact that it's happened at work and nowhere else is making me wonder if I'm potentially having some kind of reaction to something we sell, even without eating it?

I'm not sure how that would work exactly. I know it can happen. I work in a cafe, and the company like to introduce new limited time drinks, so I'm thinking it could be that. 

And no, it's not coffee. I literally crave it constantly and never react to it.

I don't know. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. Still, I'd like to find out if this could be possible? If so, I wonder what it could be...hmm ",2,1745969329.0,Allergies,7,1.0,False
1kb27tc,https://i.redd.it/otq6n4q7zuxe1.jpeg,My (probably strange) Comfort Character,"Art definitely isn't mine. I wish I could draw this well.

He's helped me through some really tough times, and sometimes I feel pretty alone in having what is almost an ""imaginary friend"", though, not quite. More like someone who's there if I go to my ""happy place"" or ""safe place"" as a kind of meditation, like when trying to relax or reregulate, or someone whose calm, rational demeanor I try to emulate when overwhelmed...even though it's really just the rational part of my mind telling me what I should do to regulate in that moment. 

Making up little stories about day to day life together, like little moments, say, making pancakes and coffee in a kitchen in the early hours of the morning, or imagining his opinions during conversation on certain things, like an assignment or a project, or a decision about priorities...it helps in the most stressful moments, when I'm unsure I have the resilience to overcome what it is I'm up against. He gives me hope, and tells me I've done the impossible before, and I can do it again.

With that said...I can't imagine anyone in my life knowing I have such a deep attachment to this character, even if I see it as a healthy coping mechanism,  and a tool of resilience,  to use my imagination this way; I feel like it would be readily misunderstood,  and be unsettling to anyone who found out.

When I was a child (anytime around 2008 and 2013 or so) a friend of mine showed me a series titled BRAWL WARS, which had an opening very similar to the text crawl of the Star Wars films. It was a series created using custom stages and gameplay recordings. After reminiscing on this during a conversation, I am really wanting to find it again, but lack the recourses to do so. If anybody can find it for me, that would be awesome.

I remember a few scenes vaguely and will describe them the best I can...

  
?: So what do you guys do for fun around here?

??: Oh well we like to mess with Wolf and his crew. Like just last week we put laxitives in Jigglypuff's coffee.

Cut to JigglyPuff: I SHIT MYSELF

??: And next we're gonna put a pipebomb in Wolf's Toilet!

Cut to wolf, crouching on the stage as if he were on a toilet: WHAT THE FU-\*explosion\*

  
Another scene depicts Pit hunting down Yoshi, remarking that he is a great monster before cutting to Yoshi, depicting him in his final smash.

Another scene depicts Snake infiltrating the main crew's ship, getting in contact with Lucario, who reports to Bowser.

I will go by Mary for privacy reasons. My classmate 23F, lets call her Ashley, asked to stay in my apartment for a few days for upcoming events. This would total out to 4 nights Ashley would stay at my apartment. I am very open to allowing classmates to stay at my apartment as I have the biggest apartment, lives directly across from the university and I have a 2 bedroom with no roommates. (I use the other bedroom as an office space) I have hosted events but never have I had any of my classmates stay with me more than one night.

Some background information about Ashley, she has IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). She is very open with people about this illness because she cannot eat certain foods or she is constantly using the bathroom. This has never bothered me and yes, i knew before I let her stay the night. She also has severe anxiety to the point where simple conversations are very hard for her. For example, we were asked to take HR during class and she was taking it on the wrong side of my wrist. I corrected her by saying, ""Pulse is supposed to be taken on this side of the wrist, try to remember thumb side pulse side."" She then insisted that I was wrong and that everyone she knows takes it on that side. To avoid arguments, I just simply say okay and drop it. Class ended and as soon as our professor walked out Ashley says loudly ""Thanks for calling me out Mary."" She then explains to the class that I said she didnt know what she was doing and told her she needs to pay attention more. There has been many situations like this but I know its her anxiety so I brush them off.

So the day comes for Ashley to stay the night. I offered her to stay in my bedroom as I am a night owl. I usually cook at night since im used to stay up for my overnight shifts at work. It is around 10:00pm and Ashley and I are sitting on the couch watching a movie. We have to be up around 6:00am, so she went inside my room to go to sleep. We wake up the next morning and I had noticed she has not taken a shower, I think no biggy sometimes people take a day or two. I also did not want to bother her as it would make her anxiety spike. We stay at the event from 6am to around 7:00pm, I know long day. We go home, I shower and grab a spot on the couch to finish up some homework. She still has not showered. We picked up food before we came home so she is just eating. Around 9:00pm, I notice she is running in and out the bathroom, nothing unusal but I notice I have not heard the water run for her washing hands. No i was not ease dropping but you can hear if your turn on the water or not. She has now gone to the bathroom 3 times and has not washed her hands. I try to look over it but Ashley began doing more unsanitary things.

It is now around 11:00pm, Ashley and I are still watching movies on the couch. She proceeds to take off her socks and put her BARE FOOT on my coffee table. Lets not forget to mention her feet also smells pretty bad. Our other classmate, let's call her Rachel, made her cry the last time she commented on the smell and I did not want to make her upset, I just thought she would go to bed soon and it will all be over.

I have a sectional couch, Ashley was sitting on the longer end while I was on the shorter. It is now midnight and I keep noticing Ashley shifting every 30 seconds to a minute. I start to notice that she has been coming closer and closer to me with every move. I moved to the end of the couch and put my knees to my chest. Ashley finally stop shifting after she managed to put her head on my legs. I am still in the same knee to chest position but I shifted to have her in my full view but made it not so obvious because I was still on my phone. I then saw her dig inside her pants, bring her hand to her nose saw/heard her sniff her fingers. I instantly begin to freak out. She repeated this 3 more times minus the sniffing. I was in a state of slient panic, I cannot believe this was happeneing and did not know what to say that wouldnt offend her.

It finally hit 1am and she left the living room. I was somewhere between overwhelmed and scared to touch everything. She came back out momentarily but then went inside the room for good. I grabbed the only pillow and blanket she did not touch and tried to go to sleep in my round chair in the living room. I was so flustered and panicked I just started crying and left at 1:30am. I have the key to Rachels apartment and I alarmed her what was going on. She told me to come whenever, I know my way around her apartment so she didnt feel the need to stay up. She woke up to me on her couch, eyes swollen shut and snack wrappers.

Turns out Ashley woke back up around 4:00am and came looking for me inside the living room. She had texted Rachel worried about where I had gone but Rachel lied and told her I got called into work and crashed at her place because it was closer. It was around 10:00am when I woke up but I didnt end up leaving Rachels until around 12:00pm. I stopped at the store and bought 5 cans of lysol but also bought other groceries to hid the cleaning supplies. When I came home, I made sure to only stand inside my kitchen and to not touch anything. Ashley told me that she was just going to just stay with her family and drive for the event we had later in the day. While having a conversation with Rachel about the night, I had remebered that Ashley told me that she had a severe yeast infection that she could not get rid of a week before coming to my apartment. I had totally spaced it. Usually I dont listen to much of what Ashley says because she over exgaerrate things to make it more then what it seems. I had another panic attack and could not bare being inside my apartment.

After she left I immediately deep cleaned my apartment throwing away anything she touched and spray a heavy coat of lysol on the things I couldnt. I still slept at Rachels house for a week and it took me almost two weeks to be able to sit on my own couch.

It has now been a couple of months but Ashley has asked me again if she can stay at my apartment. She has no suspicion that I am disgusted with her actions or that I even saw what she did. How do i explain that she is never NEVER allowed to stay inside my apartment again.

Hi guys - I'm a 39F in a debilitating health episode for over a month now. During our first session, my new therapist said that I sound exactly like her other clients who have POTS. So I've been reading posts on this sub and wondering if this could be me. Thanks in advance for your feedback.

Looking back, in the months leading up to this episode, I was gravitating towards being in my bed/horizontal subconsciously and staying home as opposed to being up and out and about in the world. I was under intense relational and work/life stress for a long period of time, and figured my body was just stressed and craving rest.

The first signals of something really wrong came after a few days of undereating and going too long between meals while drinking a lot of coffee, taking probiotics, supplements on an empty stomach etc. I suddenly got reflux and indigestion so bad that I felt like I couldn't take a full breath. I followed reflux protocols, dropped my supplements and one med I was taking electively, Spironolactone, 50mg a day for acne, which can cause GI issues. (I later blamed suddenly going off this med for my problems, for a few weeks.)  
  
Anyway, that was a Thursday. By Sunday I was in the ER with my highest ever blood pressure reading (160 over something), gastro symptoms, and PANIC. It felt like I was jumping out of my skin, I couldn't stay still and had to keep going for long pacing walks where I felt out of body, even though I was starving and exhausted. They did an EKG, ultrasound, found nothing wrong, sent me home with antacids.  
  
Over the next week I was in and out of my PCP and urgent care and the ER. Labs turned up nothing, CT scan nothing, X rays nothing, Zofran only marginally helped with nausea. They prescribed me Zoloft for anxiety, which I didn't start taking then because I was worried about more GI upset.

For the next couple weeks I just halted life completely, ate small bland meals, got lots of rest, went on walks, and started to feel gradual daily improvement. I noticed that even small things sent me into anxiety/panic. My ex and I coparent 50/50, but he'd had the kids for extra time since I was doing so poorly. My current husband has his own kids he coparents 50/50 and he was struggling a bit to show up for me and have empathy, which caused more stress between us.

Then, the gradual improvement turned into an even worse nosedive and suddenly I was struggling with debilitating daily nausea. I had gotten my kids back, but they immediately needed to go back to their dad again because I just could not function. My sleep started to suffer, I noticed I was jerking awake with a weird panic feeling every time I tried to drift off to sleep. I was waking up at 3 am, shaky, heart racing, chills, sweaty, unable to get back to sleep.

By this time I was staying at my mom's because I needed a lot more care. The sleep went from bad to nonexistent, literally 2 hours a night at most. I had gone from drifting off then jerking awake in a panic, to not even drifting off. It was about this time I started to track my vitals and noticed that my heart was racing at odd times, like when I simply stood up to walk across the room or use the bathroom. Going from 60-80 sitting/lying down to 100-120+ standing up. My BP readings were consistenly in the high 130s to 140s. I also noticed a slight tremor in my head/neck when lying down.  
  
I got an endoscopy done, and that came back clear. I thought maybe that would help with my anxiety, but the sleep problems continued, along with nausea and indigestion. After over a week with no more than 2 hours total sleep per night, I landed in the ER once more; the doctor told me that absolutely nothing is wrong with me other than stress and exhaustion, prescribed Seroquel to help me sleep and sent me home.

For the past 4 nights, I've been taking Seroquel and it has helped me catch up on sleep. I take 50 mg an hour or so before bedtime and if I can't sleep after that, or wake up and can't fall back asleep, take 50 mg more. I don't like how it makes me feel the next day if I have to take the 50 mg more but at least I sleep with it. I also started 25 mg Zoloft 4 days ago too.

Yesterday was the best I'd felt in a while, but I struggled to sleep again after a couple good nights. I took the extra Seroquel dose around 2 am out of necessity, when I was panicky and sweating, and had to wake my mom up like a little kid to help me calm down. I've spent most of today feeling shaky and like the skin on my arms/shoulders is low key burning.

Nausea has abated somewhat now that I've caught up on some sleep but I still have zero appetite and have to force myself to eat 4-5x a day so I don't keep losing too much weight. I've lost 15+ pounds in the last 5-6 weeks.

I know this was long, sorry everyone. I'm seeing a provider who treats complex illness including POTS tomorrow, to get her take but I would love to hear what the community thinks.",2,1745968848.0,POTS,2,1.0,False

1kb1zjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1kb1zjt/the_weight_of_ashes/,The Weight Of Ashes,"# Chapter 1: The Man Who Almost Healed

Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her‚Äîfumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna‚Äôs passing, the twins had been born‚Äîtiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday‚ÄîEmma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then‚Äîsilence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it‚Äîcruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel‚Äôs alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tinny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn‚Äôt bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn‚Äôt drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of ‚Äústages,‚Äù ‚Äúhealing,‚Äù ‚Äúcoping,‚Äù while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog‚Äîa golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was ‚Äúgood with kids.‚Äù Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn‚Äôt ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile‚Äîas if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors‚Äîbackpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper‚Äîquiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons‚Äîa plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye‚Äîplastered with ‚ÄúProud Parent‚Äù stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later‚Äîcursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car‚ÄîRobert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn‚Äôt fix anything. It didn‚Äôt bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest‚Äîjust enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn‚Äôt enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, borrowed thing‚Äîone that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically‚Äîhis grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill‚Äîfast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn‚Äôt stop. The child‚Äôs face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn‚Äôt move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert‚Äôs jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn‚Äôt learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine‚Äîbut not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still‚Äînot enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don‚Äôt remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy‚Äîmaybe six‚Äîslipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother‚Äôs scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn‚Äôt the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn‚Äôt stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water‚Äôs edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened‚Äîthe gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back‚Äîa touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet‚Äîparents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn‚Äôt stop. He didn‚Äôt look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma‚Äôs crib and Samuel‚Äôs racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn‚Äôt contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy‚Äôs body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other‚Äôs eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn‚Äôt last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned‚Äîcautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn‚Äôt stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall‚ÄîMiller Park‚Äîunder the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn‚Äôt feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party‚Äîballoons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise‚Äîjust another utility worker. He didn‚Äôt need threats or blackmail this time. He didn‚Äôt need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma‚Äôs old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn‚Äôt shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now‚Äînot because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn‚Äôt yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck‚Äîwhite flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other‚Äôs arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it‚Äîlooped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child‚Äôs name‚ÄîEli Meyers‚Äîsuddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: ‚ÄúHe looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.‚Äù

Then a new tab opened‚Äîher niece‚Äôs photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: ‚ÄúShe still likes hide-and-seek, right?‚Äù

Linda‚Äôs hands hovered over the keys. She didn‚Äôt call anyone. She didn‚Äôt say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week‚Äîsecondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

‚ÄúSabotage.‚Äù

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn‚Äôt make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn‚Äôt need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it‚Ä¶ they were just getting started.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren‚Äôt mourning Robert‚Äôs children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn‚Äôt enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song‚Äî""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn‚Äôt special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn‚Äôt scream. He didn‚Äôt run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely‚Äîbut deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy‚Äôs brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy‚Äôs mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him‚Äîsomething fragile and bright‚Äîhad been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn‚Äôt light a cigarette. Didn‚Äôt open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn‚Äôt revenge anymore. It wasn‚Äôt even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports‚Äîall of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn‚Äôt have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I‚Äôm coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider‚Äôs Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it‚Äîand maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins‚Äîevents that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn‚Äôt yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there‚Äîmapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don‚Äôt want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn‚Äôt just violence. This was love‚Äîtwisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn‚Äôt a phone number. It wasn‚Äôt coordinates. It wasn‚Äôt a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced‚Äîsimple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel‚Äôs Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria‚Äôs pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds‚Äîone tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria‚Äôs throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it‚Äî A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself‚Äîphotographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn‚Äôt been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them‚Äîno bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph‚ÄîEmma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo‚Äôs yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn‚Äôt look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel‚Äôs face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion‚Äînot anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn‚Äôt happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn‚Äôt forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert‚Äôs lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children‚Äîtheir heads drooping in the cold‚Äîand then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then‚Äîslowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn‚Äôt acted alone.

And Halston‚Äôs nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond‚Äôs edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl‚Äôs body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still‚Äîthe dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn‚Äôt about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn‚Äôt trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn‚Äôt meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn‚Äôt want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox‚Äîthe bus driver‚Äîtook the longest. He didn‚Äôt speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn‚Äôt need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn‚Äôt needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed‚Äîsmall acts, each just a hair‚Äôs breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren‚Äôt.

At the center of the new web wasn‚Äôt a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone‚Äîa hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn‚Äôt recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now‚Äîtyped, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We‚Äôre still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn‚Äôt she?"" ""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now‚Äîsomething familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn‚Äôt needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it ‚Äúlooked wrong.‚Äù Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria‚Äôs front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",0,1745968678.0,horrorstories,2,0.5,False

I will go by Mary for privacy reasons. My classmate 23F, lets call her Ashley, asked to stay in my apartment for a few days for upcoming events. This would total out to 4 nights Ashley would stay at my apartment. I am very open to allowing classmates to stay at my apartment as I have the biggest apartment, lives directly across from the university and I have a 2 bedroom with no roommates. (I use the other bedroom as an office space) I have hosted events but never have I had any of my classmates stay with me more than one night. 

Some background information about Ashley, she has IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). She is very open with people about this illness because she cannot eat certain foods or she is constantly using the bathroom. This has never bothered me and yes, i knew before I let her stay the night. She also has severe anxiety to the point where simple conversations are very hard for her. For example, we were asked to take HR during class and she was taking it on the wrong side of my wrist. I corrected her by saying, ""Pulse is supposed to be taken on this side of the wrist, try to remember thumb side pulse side."" She then insisted that I was wrong and that everyone she knows takes it on that side. To avoid arguments, I just simply say okay and drop it. Class ended and as soon as our professor walked out Ashley says loudly ""Thanks for calling me out Mary."" She then explains to the class that I said she didnt know what she was doing and told her she needs to pay attention more. There has been many situations like this but I know its her anxiety so I brush them off. 

So the day comes for Ashley to stay the night. I offered her to stay in my bedroom as I am a night owl. I usually cook at night since im used to stay up for my overnight shifts at work. It is around 10:00pm and Ashley and I are sitting on the couch watching a movie. We have to be up around 6:00am, so she went inside my room to go to sleep. We wake up the next morning and I had noticed she has not taken a shower, I think no biggy sometimes people take a day or two. I also did not want to bother her as it would make her anxiety spike. We stay at the event from 6am to around 7:00pm, I know long day. We go home, I shower and grab a spot on the couch to finish up some homework. She still has not showered. We picked up food before we came home so she is just eating. Around 9:00pm, I notice she is running in and out the bathroom, nothing unusal but I notice I have not heard the water run for her washing hands. No i was not ease dropping but you can hear if your turn on the water or not. She has now gone to the bathroom 3 times and has not washed her hands. I try to look over it but Ashley began doing more unsanitary things. 

It is now around 11:00pm, Ashley and I are still watching movies on the couch. She proceeds to take off her socks and put her BARE FOOT on my coffee table. Lets not forget to mention her feet also smells pretty bad. Our other classmate, let's call her Rachel, made her cry the last time she commented on the smell and I did not want to make her upset, I just thought she would go to bed soon and it will all be over. 

I have a sectional couch, Ashley was sitting on the longer end while I was on the shorter. It is now midnight and I keep noticing Ashley shifting every 30 seconds to a minute. I start to notice that she has been coming closer and closer to me with every move. I moved to the end of the couch and put my knees to my chest. Ashley finally stop shifting after she managed to put her head on my legs. I am still in the same knee to chest position but I shifted to have her in my full view but made it not so obvious because I was still on my phone. I then saw her dig inside her pants, bring her hand to her nose saw/heard her sniff her fingers. I instantly begin to freak out. She repeated this 3 more times minus the sniffing. I was in a state of slient panic, I cannot believe this was happeneing and did not know what to say that wouldnt offend her. 

It finally hit 1am and she left the living room. I was somewhere between overwhelmed and scared to touch everything. She came back out momentarily but then went inside the room for good. I grabbed the only pillow and blanket she did not touch and tried to go to sleep in my round chair in the living room. I was so flustered and panicked I just started crying and left at 1:30am. I have the key to Rachels apartment and I alarmed her what was going on. She told me to come whenever, I know my way around her apartment so she didnt feel the need to stay up. She woke up to me on her couch, eyes swollen shut and snack wrappers. 

Turns out Ashley woke back up around 4:00am and came looking for me inside the living room. She had texted Rachel worried about where I had gone but Rachel lied and told her I got called into work and crashed at her place because it was closer. It was around 10:00am when I woke up but I didnt end up leaving Rachels until around 12:00pm. I stopped at the store and bought 5 cans of lysol but also bought other groceries to hid the cleaning supplies. When I came home, I made sure to only stand inside my kitchen and to not touch anything. Ashley told me that she was just going to just stay with her family and drive for the event we had later in the day. While having a conversation with Rachel about the night, I had remebered that Ashley told me that she had a severe yeast infection that she could not get rid of a week before coming to my apartment. I had totally spaced it. Usually I dont listen to much of what Ashley says because she over exgaerrate things to make it more then what it seems. I had another panic attack and could not bare being inside my apartment. 

After she left I immediately deep cleaned my apartment throwing away anything she touched and spray a heavy coat of lysol on the things I couldnt. I still slept at Rachels house for a week and it took me almost two weeks to be able to sit on my own couch.

It has now been a couple of months but Ashley has asked me again if she can stay at my apartment. She has no suspicion that I am disgusted with her actions or that I even saw what she did. How do i explain that she is never NEVER allowed to stay inside my apartment again. 

I will answer questions in the comments for better understandings and advice.

1kb1yll,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1kb1yll/the_weight_of_ashes/,The Weight Of Ashes,"# Chapter 1: The Man Who Almost Healed

Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her‚Äîfumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna‚Äôs passing, the twins had been born‚Äîtiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday‚ÄîEmma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then‚Äîsilence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it‚Äîcruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel‚Äôs alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tinny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn‚Äôt bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn‚Äôt drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of ‚Äústages,‚Äù ‚Äúhealing,‚Äù ‚Äúcoping,‚Äù while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog‚Äîa golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was ‚Äúgood with kids.‚Äù Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn‚Äôt ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile‚Äîas if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors‚Äîbackpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper‚Äîquiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons‚Äîa plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye‚Äîplastered with ‚ÄúProud Parent‚Äù stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later‚Äîcursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car‚ÄîRobert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn‚Äôt fix anything. It didn‚Äôt bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest‚Äîjust enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn‚Äôt enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, borrowed thing‚Äîone that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically‚Äîhis grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill‚Äîfast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn‚Äôt stop. The child‚Äôs face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn‚Äôt move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert‚Äôs jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn‚Äôt learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine‚Äîbut not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still‚Äînot enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don‚Äôt remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy‚Äîmaybe six‚Äîslipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother‚Äôs scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn‚Äôt the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn‚Äôt stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water‚Äôs edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened‚Äîthe gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back‚Äîa touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet‚Äîparents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn‚Äôt stop. He didn‚Äôt look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma‚Äôs crib and Samuel‚Äôs racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn‚Äôt contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy‚Äôs body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other‚Äôs eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn‚Äôt last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned‚Äîcautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn‚Äôt stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall‚ÄîMiller Park‚Äîunder the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn‚Äôt feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party‚Äîballoons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise‚Äîjust another utility worker. He didn‚Äôt need threats or blackmail this time. He didn‚Äôt need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma‚Äôs old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn‚Äôt shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now‚Äînot because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn‚Äôt yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck‚Äîwhite flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other‚Äôs arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it‚Äîlooped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child‚Äôs name‚ÄîEli Meyers‚Äîsuddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: ‚ÄúHe looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.‚Äù

Then a new tab opened‚Äîher niece‚Äôs photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: ‚ÄúShe still likes hide-and-seek, right?‚Äù

Linda‚Äôs hands hovered over the keys. She didn‚Äôt call anyone. She didn‚Äôt say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week‚Äîsecondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

‚ÄúSabotage.‚Äù

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn‚Äôt make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn‚Äôt need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it‚Ä¶ they were just getting started.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren‚Äôt mourning Robert‚Äôs children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn‚Äôt enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song‚Äî""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn‚Äôt special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn‚Äôt scream. He didn‚Äôt run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely‚Äîbut deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy‚Äôs brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy‚Äôs mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him‚Äîsomething fragile and bright‚Äîhad been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn‚Äôt light a cigarette. Didn‚Äôt open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn‚Äôt revenge anymore. It wasn‚Äôt even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports‚Äîall of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn‚Äôt have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I‚Äôm coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider‚Äôs Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it‚Äîand maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins‚Äîevents that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn‚Äôt yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there‚Äîmapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don‚Äôt want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn‚Äôt just violence. This was love‚Äîtwisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn‚Äôt a phone number. It wasn‚Äôt coordinates. It wasn‚Äôt a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced‚Äîsimple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel‚Äôs Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria‚Äôs pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds‚Äîone tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria‚Äôs throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it‚Äî A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself‚Äîphotographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn‚Äôt been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them‚Äîno bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph‚ÄîEmma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo‚Äôs yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn‚Äôt look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel‚Äôs face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion‚Äînot anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn‚Äôt happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn‚Äôt forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert‚Äôs lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children‚Äîtheir heads drooping in the cold‚Äîand then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then‚Äîslowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn‚Äôt acted alone.

And Halston‚Äôs nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond‚Äôs edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl‚Äôs body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still‚Äîthe dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn‚Äôt about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn‚Äôt trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn‚Äôt meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn‚Äôt want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox‚Äîthe bus driver‚Äîtook the longest. He didn‚Äôt speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn‚Äôt need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn‚Äôt needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed‚Äîsmall acts, each just a hair‚Äôs breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren‚Äôt.

At the center of the new web wasn‚Äôt a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone‚Äîa hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn‚Äôt recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now‚Äîtyped, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We‚Äôre still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn‚Äôt she?"" ""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now‚Äîsomething familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn‚Äôt needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it ‚Äúlooked wrong.‚Äù Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria‚Äôs front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",0,1745968605.0,horror,1,0.43,False
1kb1xwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1kb1xwt/every_boyfriend_i_get_is_brutally_dying_now_i/,Every boyfriend I get is brutally dying. Now I know the truth about them‚Ä¶and me.,"‚ÄúIt's me, Brianna. Not you.‚Äù

That's what my latest boyfriend told me before walking directly into the path of a truck. There was barely anything left of him, just enough to peel off the sidewalk.

I thought our relationship was going well. It's not like I'm desensitized to my boyfriends dying (or ceasing to exist), but it's almost become the norm.

Ben was my first boyfriend in high school and my longest relationship to date. 

Fluffy-haired Ben, with his dimpled grin and freckles. 

He was the type of guy who should have been popular but chose to keep to himself.

I met him in the principal‚Äôs office. Ben was being lectured for ‚Äòsneaking around,‚Äô and I was handing in a late assignment. All he did was wink at me, and I fell.

Hard.

We dated for two years, and I really thought he was the one. Ben told me he loved me, and every Friday he introduced me to a new restaurant. I was in love. 

I loved everything about him.

On the night before our senior prom, a drunk driver T-boned my boyfriend's car, killing him instantly. After his funeral, it was like he stopped existing. 

His parents left town, and every time I mentioned him, my parents would slowly tilt their heads and act confused.

My brother was the worst for it, considering he and Ben were best friends.

But he just looked at me with this weird fucking look in his eye, like his soul had been ripped out. Eyes are the windows to the soul, apparently, and my brother's soul was MIA. ‚ÄúBen?‚Äù His expression crumpled. ‚ÄúWait, who?‚Äù

Alex was my emotional support, who later became someone closer.

Funny Alex.

Blonde-but-not-quite-blonde Alex.

I met him in group therapy.

My boyfriend was dead, and he had just lost his mother. We didn't label it, because he had a girlfriend, and I didn't want to move on so quickly. I think we just found comfort in each other.

Eventually, though, Alex became something I wanted to label.

His sense of humor was a breath of fresh air. I didn't go to college because of Ben‚Äôs death, settling for a mediocre barista stop in town. Alex came in every day with fresh coffee and a sugar cookie. 

I think I loved him. 

I told him that, half asleep, I told him I wanted to try and be something more with him. Alex looked taken aback, but happy.

We spent the night together.

The morning after, I woke to my mother screaming.

Alex was dead in the bathroom, his blood splattering, staining pristine white.

According to the first responders, he died of a self-inflicted head injury. The exact same thing followed. I attended his funeral, and Alex‚Äôs family disappeared.

This time, I went back to his house. But according to a neighbor, his house had been abandoned for ten years. I had eaten pancakes in his kitchen just days earlier.

I broke in to see for myself, but my neighbor was right. The hallway was piled with ancient mail and threats of eviction. Alex‚Äôs room didn't exist. Instead, there was a storage room filled with boxes.

When I got home, my family had already forgotten Alex‚Äôs existence.

The town had forgotten him, and yet his blood still stained my bathroom.

Following Alex‚Äôs death, I was terrified of getting too close to people.

But Esme made it hard.

She was my third relationship. We met at a bar. 

I was extremely drunk and convinced I was cursed to kill all of my romantic partners. Esme. Cute Esme. Crooked teeth, smudged lipstick, and warm Esme.

Do you know that person you meet and instantly connect with? The person you're sure is your soulmate?

That was Esme.

I told myself I wouldn't get close to her. But I was already talking to this girl, already pouring my life out to her. 

Esme sat and listened, her chin resting on her fist. 

She was a first-year creative writing student, and she had a cat called Peanut.

I didn't remember much after that. 

We hit it off, and next thing I knew, we were curled up in the back of her car watching Buffy on her iPad. 

I told her about my exes, and she nodded and smiled, but I don't think she was really listening.

I told her all of my exes have died, and then been erased from existence.

Esme called me cute. She wanted to base a story around the concept, sitting up and grabbing her phone.

I have this memory of the girl I fell in love with at first sight.

She's nodding along to a Smiths song sputtering from my car radio, typing on her phone. I can hear the tapping of her nails, her lips curving into a smile. 

I can see the exact moment she gets inspiration, pulling her knees to her chest. She's wearing fishnet tights that are torn and a jacket that doesn't fit her.

She is fucking beautiful, and I don't want to lose her.

Alex was beautiful.

He had pretty eyes and brown curls that I liked running my hands through. Ben was beautiful. He made my heart swim, my stomach swarm with butterflies when I first met him. Ben was my first love.

The realization woke me up one night, three months into dating Esme.

Both of them were dead, wiped away like they never existed.

And Esme would follow.

At first, I tried to break it off with her without sounding crazy. I told her it was me, not her, and I wasn't in the mindset for a relationship.

Esme understood, but her eyes didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt want to lose her. Esme lit up every room she entered. Her obsession with thrifted clothes, badly written poems, and her irrational fear of pandas made her someone I wanted to be with.

So, I stayed with her. I told myself Ben and Alex were just coincidences, that it was nothing to do with me, and I wasn‚Äôt indirectly fucking killing the people I fell in love with.

I avoided the ‚ÄòL‚Äô word for as long as I could.

It slipped out on my way to work. Esme was driving.

I just said it, and her eyes lit up. She reached out and squeezed my hand.

At work, one of my colleagues, Jasper, caught my eye. When I twisted around to ask him to grab something, I glimpsed his phone screen. It looked like Tinder, though I didn‚Äôt recognize the layout.

It reminded me of Twitter, in dark mode. Jasper was leaning against the counter, his thumb hovering over a photo of Esme, chewing his bottom lip.

I watched his thumb prance across the screen before he gave up and swiped left.

Finishing up the woman‚Äôs coffee, I handed it over.

‚ÄúUhh, I asked for cream.‚Äù

Ignoring her, I sidled in front of my colleague, hyper-focused on whatever app he was playing around with. ‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äù

Jasper looked up, his eyes widening, lips parting like a fucking goldfish.

‚ÄúClearly nothing.‚Äù Jasper sidestepped me, opened the refrigerator, and pulled out milk. But he already had milk. The bastard was stalling. We had zero customers waiting, so it was just the two of us and a long, dragged-out pause.

Jumping up and down on the heels of his feet, he shot me his usual grin, slipping his phone into his apron.

Jasper may have been smiling, but there was something twisted in his expression.

I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. ‚ÄúWas that a dating app?‚Äù

‚ÄúDating app?‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me, can I get what I ordered?‚Äù The woman demanded, waving her coffee in the air. ‚ÄúI asked for whipped cream.‚Äù

Jasper saw that as an excuse, an escape, and nodded, fashioning a grin. He saw an opportunity, and took it.

‚ÄúOf course, Ma‚Äôam! I'll get that for you!‚Äù He said, with a little too much sarcasm.

The boy took her coffee with a spring in his step, ducking in the refrigerator for the whipping cream. Jasper added too much whipping cream, dumping the drink on the counter with a little too much force. 

It was a good thing my colleague was marginally attractive guy with cropped blonde hair, and a deadpan voice that *somehow* attracted the ladies. 

Jasper could insult someone directly to their face, and they would just blush and get all tongue tied. I had seen it happen in real time. A girl was flirting with him, and used a *bad* pick-up line, which was something along the lines of, ‚ÄúDid it hurt when you fell from Heaven?‚Äù

He laughed, and her eyes brightened. She giggled along with him, nudging her friends. 

But he wasn't laughing with her. I saw the gleam in his eye. 

He was laughing *at* her. 

Still laughing, Jasper plonked her milk latte down so hard half of it spewed out. 

And, with that exact same charming smile, he deadpanned, ‚ÄúDid it hurt when you dropped out of a drainpipe?‚Äù

Yeah, my colleague was blessed with good looks. 

Otherwise, he would have been punched in the face by now. 

Presently, he was being his usual asshole self. ‚ÄúIs there anything *else* I can get you?‚Äù

The woman shook her head, pulling a face. 

Jasper had, essentially, ruined her drink. It was more cream than coffee. 

When she left the store, I situated myself in front of him when he was counting cash. ‚ÄúWhat were you just looking at?‚Äù 

I nodded to the guy‚Äôs phone sticking out of his pocket. ‚ÄúWas it like‚Ä¶ a dating thing you were on?‚Äù

Jasper didn't even look at me, his lip curling. 

‚ÄúThat's kinda rude,‚Äù he hummed, ‚ÄúI don't peek at your phone.‚Äù

‚ÄúEsme Hope.‚Äù Was all I could hiss out. ‚ÄúWas she on that dating app?‚Äù

My colleague proceeded to stare at me like I'd grown a second head, before his half lidded gaze flicked behind me. Jasper‚Äôs expression brightened. 

‚ÄúOh, Hanna is calling me!‚Äù He said, choking out a laugh. 

Hanna was *not* calling him. She was in the break room getting high. Jasper slowly backed away, maintaining his smile. 

‚ÄúI'll be back in a sec, all right?‚Äù He grabbed that same carton of milk with a grin. ‚ÄúDon't you just *love* when your milk stays fresh?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù 

‚ÄúFresh milk!‚Äù He grinned. ‚ÄúMulberry Farm‚Äôs finest.‚Äù

Jasper was darting away before I could coerce a sentence. 

After work, I texted Esme as usual. She was my ride on Fridays. 

Esme didn't reply. 

I texted her again, a little more panicked. 

**Hey, are you okay?‚Äù** 

When I called her, an automated voice told me she wasn't available. 

Already feeling sick to my stomach, I drove to her place myself. 

I could see the flashing lights before anything else, blurred red and blue sending my thoughts into a whirlwind. 

It took me ten minutes to muster the courage to jump out of my car, and ask a pale looking deputy what was going on. 

I tried to jump over the yellow tape, only to be politely pulled back. 

‚ÄúCarbon monoxide poisoning,‚Äù the deputy told me. 

‚ÄúThe whole family is dead.‚Äù he sighed. ‚ÄúMom, Dad, and their daughter in college.‚Äù 

I think he was trying to be sympathetic, awkwardly patting me. But I was already on my knees, all of the breath dragged from my lungs. ‚ÄúLuckily, it's just like going to sleep. Monoxide is a silent killer.‚Äù

*Monoxide is a silent killer.*

Was that the same as, *‚ÄúI'm sorry. Ben was in the wrong place at the wrong time.‚Äù*

And, *‚ÄúAlex was silently suffering. He did what he thought was best.‚Äù*

I didn't go to Esme‚Äôs funeral. Mom and Dad and Will had already forgotten her, just like the others. What I did do, several days later, when her name wasn't even a memory anymore‚Äì I bought flowers from the store. Roses were Esme‚Äôs favourite. 

The seller was around my Mom‚Äôs age, a plump looking woman wearing a floral dress, long red hair tied into a ponytail. 

She was on her phone, humming to a tune on the radio. 

*The Smiths*. 

‚ÄúI hope she likes them.‚Äù  The woman said, wrapping the flowers in red ribbons. 

She had a strong southern accent that immediately annoyed me. 

I took the roses, stuffing them in my bag. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù

The seller cocked her head. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you know they were for my girlfriend?‚Äù

The woman sighed, placing her phone on the counter. I glanced at whatever she'd been so interested in, but the screen was faced down. ‚ÄúEsme came in here a lot,‚Äù Her lips broke out into a sad, sympathetic smile. I was quickly growing sick of them. 

‚ÄúEsme. She, uh, she told me you guys were dating. Esme was always buying roses for her room. Sometimes she would stand in here for hours, and just stare at flowers. I think she found comfort in them.‚Äù 

The woman sighed, fixing me with what I could only describe as a pitiful pout. 

Urgh. 

‚ÄúI hope you can find the same comfort,‚Äù she murmured. The seller handed me an extra rose, and I found myself reaching out for it, my eyes stinging. Fuck. 

I hadn't cracked in at least fifteen hours, and that was a record. 

But now I could feel myself splintering, tears trickling down my cheeks. 

The Flower lady squeezed my hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, sweetheart. If it makes you feel better, it's just like going to sleep. Monoxide is a silent killer.‚Äù 

Her words were familiar. 

Exactly what the deputy said. Before I could speak, she dumped weed killer on the counter. ‚ÄúDid you know our plant killer is ten dollars ninety nine?‚Äù 

Her sudden bout of energy took me off guard. 

I tried to smile. ‚ÄúI don't want any plant killer.‚Äù

The seller nodded, handing me another rose. ‚ÄúOh, of course, Darling! But it is five ninety nine! Just for today!‚Äù

Something pricked me, and I hissed out, wafting my hand. 

Damn thorns. I could already see a single spot of blood. 

I nodded, sucking my teeth against a cry. ‚ÄúThanks. But I'll skip it this time.‚Äù

I took the roses to what used to be Esme‚Äôs grave. Now, it was an empty headstone with no name, no memories, no flowers, nothing. Just like Alex and Ben, Esme had been reduced to dirt under my feet. I stayed at her ‚Äògrave‚Äô for a long time, long enough for the sky to grow dark, and my thoughts darker. 

I tried to find a logical explanation for the sudden deaths of the people I got close to, but all I could think of was a curse. 

So, I started googling curses, leaning against Esme‚Äôs headstone, my knees to my chest. Had I *been* cursed? 

Was my family cursed? 

According to Google, a cursed object connected with the curse itself. 

Which could be anything. Though I didn't remember visiting any ancient ruins, or an old church. With zero answers, I headed home. I passed a guy playing The Smiths in his car. Then a group of older  women wearing ripped fishnets. 

Esme was following me. Just like Alex‚Äôs smell. Fresh coffee and rich chocolate. 

Ben‚Äôs cologne filled my car last summer. His favourite band was playing all day on our local music station. 

I drove around with no destination, listening to each one on repeat, until I was losing him all over again. 

The sweet aroma of flowers followed me all the way home, and I was tipsy on the smell, when I found myself face to face with a boy. Under the overexposed streetlight, this guy was almost ethereal, thick brown hair and freckles. 

He reminded me of Ben. Which wasn't fair. I thought I was hallucinating him, before he came closer, bleeding from the shadow. I saw more of him, white strips of something wrapped around his head. 

*Wrong*. 

The word slammed into me when I glimpsed his clothes. Filthy. 

The guy was wearing a white button down, a single streak of bright red ingrained into the material. His white pants were torn, glued to his legs. 

He was barefoot, the soles of his feet slapping on wet concrete. 

I didn't realize he was in front of me, nose to nose, until he shoved me. Hard. 

‚ÄúJosie.‚Äù His voice was a whimper, despite his narrowed eyes, his lips twisted into a scowl. 

He was crying. 

The boy shoved me again, and I staggered. 

His ice cold breath grazed my cheeks. ‚ÄúWhat the *fuck* did you do to my sister?‚Äù

‚ÄúSister?‚Äù I whispered. 

Something wet landed on my cheek, suddenly. 

Rain. 

I wasn't expecting a downpour. The weather was forecasted to be clear. 

To my surprise, the guy let out a harsh sounding laugh. The two of us were slowly getting drenched, but neither of us were making a move to get out of the rain. My hair was glued to the back of my neck, my clothes sticking to me. 

But somehow, I wanted to stay in the rain. It was refreshing. 

When a thought hit me, telling me to *get out* of the rain, it was shoved to the back of my mind. The guy spat water out of his mouth, shaking his head like a dog. 

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù he muttered, ‚ÄúDrown me out with the rain.‚Äù

I found my voice, my gaze glued to intense red seeping through the bandage stapled to his head. He looked like he‚Äôd escaped an emergency room. ‚ÄúI don't know anyone  called Josie,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI think you've got the wrong person.‚Äù

The guy‚Äôs eyes narrowed. He stepped closer, grabbing my shoulders, and I noticed how hollow his eyes were, empty caverns carved into his skull. 

Eyes are the windows to the soul, and this guy was completely soulless. 

‚ÄúI'm only going to say this once,‚Äù he whispered, ‚ÄúWhat did you do to my sister?‚Äù

Before I could respond, the guy was being violently grabbed, and dragged back. 

Figures who appeared seemingly out of nowhere. 

‚ÄúLet me go!‚Äù He cried out, struggling. ‚ÄúYou fucking assholes! Let me go!‚Äù

His screaming became muffling, when his cries were gagged.

‚ÄúYou promised!‚Äù He yelled, his cries collapsing into a sob. 

‚ÄúYou said if you took me, she wouldn't get hurt! So, where is she?‚Äù he met my gaze, his expression crumpling, something inside him coming apart, splintering by the seams. 

‚ÄúYou can't take *both* of us, this wasn't in the agreement!‚Äù 

When he was dragged further back, I noticed a car parked at the side of the road. 

The boy was pulled inside. At first, he refused, before an extra pair of hands shoved him. ‚ÄúYou fucking‚Äì *mmmphmmhphmmm*!‚Äù

I heard his fists slamming into the windows. 

‚ÄúDon't take me back there! Please! Just let Josie‚Äì‚Äù 

His cries once again collapsed into angry muffle screaming, and I felt my hands moving towards my pocket for my phone. 

This was a kidnapping, right? I was witnessing a kidnapping in broad fucking daylight. 

A shadow was suddenly in front of me, and I jumped, tearing my eyes from the car. Jasper, my colleague. He was still wearing his apron, and to my confusion, was swinging a carton of whole milk. 

‚ÄúSorry, Bree,‚Äù He winked, speaking in a  single breath. ‚ÄúAs you can see, our friend here had a *little* too much to drink.‚Äù

I nodded, craning my neck. Jasper stepped in front of me, maintaining a grin. 

‚ÄúWho is he?‚Äù This time, I side-stepped away from him, only for him to copy. 

‚ÄúJust a... guy.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúAs you can see, he's a little‚Ä¶‚Äù Jasper prodded his right temple. ‚ÄúLet's just say he's got a few too many screws loose.‚Äù Jasper laughed, staying stock still, blocking my way. 

When I made a move to counter him, he stepped in front of me, his eyes hardening. ‚ÄúI heard he lost his family a while ago in a‚Ä¶‚Äù He pretended to think. ‚ÄúOh, yeah, a car crash. Maybe a gas explosion, I‚Äôm not really sure.‚Äù 

I could hear the car behind him, and once again I tried to dart past him. But he was quick to block my way. He was getting closer to me, very subtly backing me in the opposite direction. 

‚ÄúAnyway, this guy is kiiiiind of nuts. Dude still thinks he's got a sister.‚Äù

When I lost patience and shoved him out of the way, the car, and the guy, was gone. 

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù Jasper rolled his eyes. He was still holding milk from work. My head spun. 

It was 8pm, we were in a suburban neighborhood, and Jasper was holding half a pint of milk. His apron was stained with coffee, and when I really *looked* at him, I realized he was out of breath. 

He was doing a good job of hiding it, exhaling in intervals, swiping at his forehead to clear sweat. 

When I noticed, he pretended to run his hands through his hair. 

‚ÄúI, uh, I feel for him! Like, I'm sorry his family died, or whatever, but attacking random girls isn't cool, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

Instead of replying, I stumbled home. It was sunny. 

At 8pm.

And when I took notice, I wasn't even wet. 

Esme was my last straw. I made a promise to myself to not get close to anyone. 

The guys and girls I met were friends, and nothing more. Weirdly enough, the only guy I was getting close to was my colleague. I don't know if it was brain damage, or I was finally losing the plot. 

But Jasper‚Äôs shameless cruelty towards customers, and that quirk in his lips when he made them cry, was kind of hot. 

However, he was playing hard to get. 

And I mean REALLY playing. 

I was in storage trying to find vegan milk, and he was suddenly a fucking expert, spewing milk facts. 

When I slammed the refrigerator door shut, he was inches from my face. 

In the dim light from a single spluttering bulb, his eyes reminded me of coffee grounds. I thought maybe he was going to kiss me, judging from his softening expression. I felt his hands go around my waist, and I felt myself immediately melt. 

I don't know what came over me. It's like, one minute I hated him, and the next‚Ä¶ I was suddenly hot. Really hot. And I really wanted to take my clothes off. I thought that's what he wanted to do too. 

I mean, his gaze followed mine, piercing, fingers playing with the buttons on his shirt. Before he leaned forward, his breath in my face. 

‚ÄúDid you know that Mulberry Farms is an award winning brand of milk in our town and ONLY our town? Mulberry farms was bred and made right here.""

And suddenly, I was no longer hot and bothered. 

‚ÄúI didn't.‚Äù I said, ducking into a crouch to search the shelves. ‚ÄúHave you seen our vegan milk? We did have some.‚Äù

‚ÄúThree *time* winner,‚Äù Jasper continued. When I jumped up, he stepped closer, and I felt my cheeks spark. His smile was rare. In fact, Jasper was only smiling when he was talking about *milk*. 

‚ÄúMulberry Farms have the best pasturization. It's suitable for everything! Coffee, cereal, or maybe you just want a glass of fresh milk to yourself! Perfect for kids, too! Breakfast time *is* Mulberry Farms.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you having a stroke?‚Äù I whisper-shrieked. 

‚ÄúNope!‚Äù 

Jasper twisted around, shooting me a grin. 

I left the storage, however, with butterflies in my gut. 

There was no way I was falling for my asshole colleague. 

Somehow, though, I was. 

Just standing next to him filled me with electricity. 

The way he talked down to customers, insulting me to my face‚Ä¶ I was thoroughly, and disgustingly, in love. 

I tried to stop myself. 

I showered in ice cold water. 

I ate (choked on) a ghost pepper. 

I even asked my BROTHER for advice, who told me to go for it. 

I told him Jasper had one (of several) flaws, but this particular one was off-putting. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs obsessed with milk.‚Äù I told my brother. 

Harry lifted a brow. ‚ÄúIs that a euphemism, or‚Ä¶‚Äù

He paused, for way longer than necessary. ‚ÄúSo, your would-be-boyfriend has a milk fetish?‚Äù

I left his room before he could take that conversation further. 

I wanted to say Jasper was the only one who acted weird. 

But over the next few weeks, I noticed it in quite a few people. 

I was having breakfast with Mom, and she lifted up the box. 

‚ÄúChoco Flakes.‚Äù She blurted, ‚ÄúAren't they just the best?‚Äù

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúYeah, Mom. They're great.‚Äù

I prodded the box with a smile. ‚ÄúOnly a dollar ninety nine.‚Äù

There were so many townspeople on their phones. They walked around with groceries or briefcases, their eyes glued to whatever they were swiping through. 

I was serving an old woman, when I caught her phone screen. 

I could have sworn there was an image of Jasper. 

She swiped right, and I had a hard time looking her in the eye. 

The woman was at least in her 80‚Äôs. And I'm talking, can barely walk, and needs assistance. 

Was she seriously hitting up 25 year old guys? 

Walking home, *everyone* was on their phones. 

I stopped at a crossing, stabbing the red light. 

It started to snow the second I stepped out onto the road, white flakes dancing in front of me. It didn't even cross my mind that it was almost June. The snow was pretty, accumulating on the ground. 

‚ÄúOh shit, sorry!‚Äù

Lifting my head, a guy was standing in front of me holding an umbrella. 

I knew him. 

But not from whatever was trying to pollute my mind. 

I knew him from a while ago. I knew him from the rain. I knew the bloody bandages wrapped around his head, and soulless, seething eyes I couldn't understand. It was the boy who was dragged away three months prior. 

He looked different, his hair was shorter, his face carved into a thing of beauty. 

The white strips of gauze bleeding scarlet were gone, his filthy clothes replaced with a white shirt and pants, a trench coat flung over the top. I didn't remember him being this handsome. His dark brown hair had been tamed and curled. 

It was his expression that sent shivers sliding down my spine. 

His too wide smile and unblinking eyes made me suddenly conscious of two bright lights on the two of us. 

So bright.

Something shattered in my mind, and I was aware of a lot of things. 

The snow under my feet was *too* soft. 

I glimpsed a single streak of red seeping from his nose, his hands trembling around a takeout coffee cup. 

Behind me, people were staring. I could see a group of teenage girls giggling. 

‚ÄúIt's him,‚Äù one of them squeaked. ‚ÄúIt's the new love interest!‚Äù

‚ÄúBree?‚Äù His grin widened, snowflakes prancing around us. His teeth gritted together. I could tell he hated every word. ‚ÄúHoly shit, long time no see!‚Äù

He held out his hand, and I could see visible pain contorting in his eyes. 

*Help me.* He was screaming through a twinkling smile. 

‚ÄúDon't you remember me? It's‚Ä¶ it's uh, it's Sam!‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúFrom eighth grade!‚Äù

The lights blinked out, and the thought crashed into my mind. Static images filling my head. I shook them away. 

Oh, yeah, it *was* Sam. 

My childhood friend. 

 But I didn't reply. Instead of saying, ‚ÄúSam? It's been so long!‚Äù I found myself walking, stumbling over to the girls. 

Who were rapidly swiping left on their phones. 

‚ÄúWhat's that?‚Äù I demanded in a sharp breath. 

I grabbed for the phone, only for Sam to step in front of me. He settled me with a smile. 

Behind me, one of the girls fainted. 

Sam‚Äôs smile didn't waver. Though he did side-eye the girl being carried away. ‚ÄúWhy don't I take you out for coffee?‚Äù

Apparently, *coffee* was the code word for hooking up. 

Sam dragged me into the nearest coffee store, straight to the bathroom. 

When he shoved me into a stall, I didn't know what to say. 

‚ÄúTake off your shoes,‚Äù he said in a hiss, and after hesitating, I did. 

Sam pulled off his jacket, shook snow out of his hair, and got real close. 

‚ÄúLook up.‚Äù He murmured. 

I did, my gaze finding the ceiling. 

‚ÄúTo your right, a camera is very well hidden, but can be seen with the naked eye if you catch what looks like a red laser,‚Äù Sam said. 

‚ÄúTo your left, another camera, as well as a vent that is currently pumping the stalls with aphrodisiacs. And right now, we are in the red zone. Meaning, you should be conscious.‚Äù

He prodded me, and I flinched. 

‚ÄúMostly conscious.‚Äù

His words went right over my head, my mind was foggy. 

I couldn't think straight.

I think I asked him what he was saying, but my mouth was filled with cotton. 

‚ÄúSnap out of it,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúLike I said, they're *making* you feel like this.‚Äù

He shoved me against the door, which broke me out of my trance. Slightly. 

‚ÄúI hate what I'm going to say right now,‚Äù Sam groaned, tipping his head back. 

He was sweating, I noticed. 

Bad. I glimpsed beads of red pooling down his neck. He noticed me staring. 

‚ÄúI'm okay, for now. I‚Äôm faulty, so the connection is severed. He squeezed his eyes shut. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶think.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúSex.‚Äù He said, blinking rapidly. I wasn't going to comment on his slurring voice. 

Sam stumbled, fresh blood dripping from his nose. 

‚ÄúWe need to do the sex. Like‚Ä¶‚Äù His eyes rolled into the back of his head, but he managed to stabilise himself. ‚ÄúNooooow.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù

‚ÄúIs everything okay in there?‚Äù 

The voice was a woman. She knocked on the stall. 

Sam‚Äôs eyes widened, coming back to life a little. ‚ÄúThey're paranoid,‚Äù he whispered. When I could only stare at him, he pounded his fists into the door. 

‚ÄúThey think we‚Äôre fucking,‚Äù he hissed, ‚ÄúSo, we need to make it believable.‚Äù

*‚ÄúThey?‚Äù* I mouthed. 

He didn't reply, swiping at his haemorrhaging nose. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ move around against the door. That'll fool ‚Äòem.‚Äù

I did, doing my best to shuffle around, slamming my back against the lock.

When the metal clanged, he shot me a look. ‚ÄúI said sex!‚Äù He hissed, ‚ÄúNot murder!‚Äù 

Sam jumped onto the toilet bowl. There was an open window above him. 

*‚ÄúThat's enough.‚Äù* He mouthed, hoisting his way through. 

He helped me through, and I expected to land on concrete. 

What I did land on, however, was something‚Ä¶ squishy. 

Something wet sliding between my bare toes. 

Looking closer, I recognised the beaded anklet. 

Fishnet tights. 

Something animalistic clawed from my throat. I was standing on Esme. Or what was *left* of Esme. She was just a torso and legs, the rest of her ripped away like doll pieces. I couldn't see her face. I looked for it, digging through what could only be old flesh and pieces of limbs. 

I felt suffocated. I grabbed half of Ben‚Äôs face that had been ripped off, and then Alex‚Äôs tattooed arm. 

There was so *much* of them, piles and piles of the same heads, the same filthy and rotting clothes. I was screaming by the time I shuffled back on my hands and knees, trying to wipe them off of my skin. 

They were all over me, staining me, painting me. 

Sam‚Äôs hand slick with blood gently covered my mouth. 

‚ÄúStay calm, all right?‚Äù He whispered. ‚ÄúI would tell you everything is going to be okay, but the truth is, it's really *not*, there's like, a 99.9% chance you're going to‚Ä¶ understandably freak out.‚Äù

He pulled me to my feet, letting out a heavy breath. 

Blinking rapidly, I could only see‚Ä¶ pieces. 

Pieces of *people*. 

Legs and heads and torsos all piled into one mass of gore. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got maybe five minutes before they realize we‚Äôre not doing the devil's dance,‚Äù Sam sniffled, ‚ÄúMaybe ten, before my brain short circuits and I bleed out.‚Äù

I didn't know I was hyperventilating, until I couldn't fucking breathe. 

Closer towards the door, and I could hear‚Ä¶ machinery. 

I couldn't stop myself. Even when I was aware I was standing in congealing blood. 

Rotten bodies. 

The dim light led me into what could only be described as a factory. There were three levels, and we were on the highest. 

Sam stepped forward, gripping the metal bar in front of us. I felt my legs buckling, a thick, pukey slime filling my mouth. 

‚ÄúSoo, I guess it all started when Brianna Timberman was seventeen years old, and rejected by her childhood best friend, Sam Thwaites.‚Äù

Sam‚Äôs words collapsed into a low buzzing in my ear. 

All I could see was a conveyer belt, filled with‚Ä¶ people. 

Boys. 

Girls.

But most noticeably, Ben‚Äôs, Alex‚Äôs, Esme‚Äôs, and *Sam‚Äôs.*

But they start as Ben‚Äôs, Alex's, and Esme‚Äôs. 

I could see regular people, their hair stripped away. 

Their skin sliced into, cruelly moulding them into the exact same four faces. 

When a large looming needle plunged into the back of an Alex‚Äôs head, I couldn't *not* watch. I waited for the guy to wake up, but I don't even think he was alive. 

He stood, unblinking, letting this thing twist and contort his face. 

And it was then, when I realized these things weren't even human. 

I could see the mechanics built under their flesh, both living tissue and metal melded together. 

‚ÄúBrianna‚Äôs father, who is a liiiitle on the crazy side, with too much cash and not not enough logic, took his daughter‚Äôs rejection a little *too* personally,‚Äù Sam continued. 

‚ÄúSo, he promised his daughter he would find her the perfect match.‚Äù

I started to speak, the words coming out before I could stop them. 

‚ÄúMy father would never‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn't say it was *your* father,‚Äù Sam said. His eyes darkened. 

‚ÄúAnyway, as I was saying, the townspeople became unhealthily obsessed with who Brianna would choose.""

He sighed. ""So obsessed, in fact, that the girl‚Äôs day to day life was broadcasted across town, while her potential love interests were ranked, week after week. Think of it like the Truman Show mixed with matchmaker. First, there was Ben.‚Äù

Sam‚Äôs smile thinned. ‚ÄúHer high school boyfriend.‚Äù

Sam shrugged. ‚ÄúShe grew bored of him. Also, he kinda did something unforgivable.‚Äù

He continued. ‚ÄúThen‚Ä¶ Alex. She liked him, but sometimes, he was a little too unserious. The guy was a clown.‚Äù

I backed away, but he was quick to grab my shoulders. 

‚ÄúFinally? Esme. Who she truly fell for.‚Äù

I swallowed. ‚ÄúEsme is‚Äì‚Äù

He cut me off. ‚ÄúBut I didn't mention that they hurt her, did I?‚Äù 

Sam leaned against the bar. Behind him, I could see a figure in white pushing a gurney with a Ben strapped to it. 

‚ÄúBen tried to assault her, insisting she *wanted* it. Alex dumped her on her birthday. Esme ended their relationship with a one word text. *Goodbye*.‚Äù

Sam mimed an explosion. ‚ÄúThat was the nail in the coffin.‚Äù

I caught blood sliding down his nose. ‚ÄúYou're still bleeding.‚Äù 

Sam gingerly prodded his nose. 

‚ÄúUrgh. Yeah, it's an effect of the severing. I've been in the red zone too long. I should probably speed this up.‚Äù

He talked faster, his voice collapsing into a mumbled slur. 

‚ÄúBrianna couldn't take it. Her best friend was ignoring her. Everyone she had fallen in love with hurt her. Esme wasn't returning her calls. Ben was sleeping around right in front of her, and Alex was still being a clown. Brianna‚Äôs poor parents found her hanging from her bedroom ceiling fan.‚Äù

I shook my head, my thoughts screaming. 

‚ÄúNo‚Äì‚Äù

He held a finger up to shush me. ‚ÄúLet me talk. Jeez.‚Äù

Sam folded his arms. ‚ÄúA grieving father would do anything to avenge his dead child, buuut‚Ä¶ Mr Timberman took ‚Äòfinding a perfect match‚Äô and ‚Äòthe show must go on‚Äô a little bit too literally.‚Äù

His sickly smile found me. 

‚ÄúThe town wanted more of Brianna, and her life, so he turned his daughter‚Äôs failed love life into a town wide TV show, sending the entire teen populace into here,‚Äù he gestured around him. 

‚ÄúTo make the *perfect* suitors. Who *wouldn't* hurt his *new* Brianna.‚Äù

Something ice cold crept down my spine. 

He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúMr Timberman grew, let's say, obsessed, with getting revenge on these specific four people. So, he started killing them‚Äì‚Äù He coughed. 

‚ÄúSorry. Us. Killing us for the funny ha-ha, ‚ÄòLook at how many times I can fuck with them!‚Äô bit. And then recycling us into someone completely different.""

""Our names are gone. Then our personalities. Finally, our bodies ripped to pieces and sculpted into Brianna‚Äôs exes.‚Äù Sam poked me in the cheek. 

‚ÄúThe cycle continues. They reset your ticker and the town eats it up. They can bring back Esme, Ben, and Alex whenever they want and add curveballs.""

""Like the *bad-boy* colleague who becomes the fan favorite.‚Äù Sam‚Äôs lips curved. ‚ÄúFor‚Ä¶ some fucking reason.‚Äù

His eyes flickered open. ‚ÄúHowever, Brianna will never find a suitor because her father is a fucking  sociopath. To him and the town, his dead daughter‚Äôs pathetic love life is entertainment.‚Äù

He held out his arm. 

‚ÄúSee?‚Äù

I tried really hard not to look through the makeup. 

At noticeable skin grafts. 

‚ÄúI was a Ben.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúThen I was an Alex, and *then* I was an extra.‚Äù His eyes found mine, sad, suddenly. ‚ÄúBut who I was originally is kinda gone. All I remember is a deal to protect Josie. I gave myself up so they wouldn't take her.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour sister.‚Äù I said. 

Sam nodded. 

His earlier words hit me. He was talking like Brianna Timberman was dead. 

But *I* was Brianna Timberman. 

I was rejected by Sam, yes, but I found Ben. 

As if he could read my mind, Sam shook his head. 

‚ÄúLook at yourself.‚Äù He said, his voice shaking. 

‚ÄúAnd I mean *really* look at yourself.‚Äù 

Sam stepped closer. 

‚ÄúBecause, underneath all of that make-up and the prosthetics and surgery, and fucked up memories, you're just another recycled lump of flesh.‚Äù

He prodded my temple. ‚ÄúWho *thinks* she is Brianna Timberman.‚Äù

His voice was slurring again, a fresh stream of scarlet seeping down his chin. 

‚ÄúDon't you want to know?‚Äù His eyes rolled to pearly whites. 

Before he could finish his sentence, Sam dropped to the ground. 

I remember warm arms grasping hold of me. 

Shadows with no faces. 

They pricked me twice in the back of my neck. 

A familiar voice in my ear, almost a hiss. 

*Jasper*. 

‚ÄúYou are the *worst* fucking Brianna.‚Äù He murmured. ""Like, dude, it's *painful* to be with you.""*

When I came to, I was standing up, somehow. 

At *work*.

**I am Brianna Timberman.**

The thought floated around in my head, my memory hazy. 

‚ÄúHello?!‚Äù

A man was waving his hands in front of me. 

‚ÄúI asked for iced coffee, lady!‚Äù

Jasper was serving another customer. ‚ÄúBree, wake the fuck up.‚Äù

They were trying to make me think I was hallucinating. 

Which was crazy, because my fingernails were still tinted with Sam‚Äôs blood. 

The marks he'd left on my wrist when he was yanking me, were still there. 

Bruised on my arm. 

‚ÄúBree!‚Äù Jasper snapped. ‚ÄúSnap out of it and make the dude his drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

The word slipped out of my mouth.

He caught my eye, winking, and Brianna Timberman internally squeaked. 

I half wondered what he was. Was he recycled, or an unwilling performer?

Throughout the day, I was fully aware my words were not mine. 

Like I was on autopilot. 

But not just that. 

My *thoughts* weren't mine, either.

I spent half of my shift staring at my colleague‚Äôs biceps. 

During my break, I went into the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror. 

I *am* Brianna Timberman. 

But even when I told myself that, my eyes were too blue.

My smile was too perfect. 

My teeth. 

Too white. 

My shaking hands prodded at my face, at someone else's face. 

So many faces, so many skin grafts. 

The thought was violent, sending tremors through me. 

How many people was I *wearing*? 

I started to claw at my arms and legs, my face. 

How many fucking people had I been? 

I grabbed a knife and tried to slice at my face.

 But there was no blood. 

How could there be no blood?!

When I got home, I found my family waiting for me. 

Mom, Dad and Harry, all of them beaming. 

‚ÄúBree!‚Äù Mom stood up, her lips stretching into a grin. 

My mouth was already moving, but they were not my words. 

‚ÄúMom!‚Äù 

I didn't know why she was smiling so much, until I saw Sam sitting at our dining room table. His smile was too big. 

His over-expensive shirt and pants did not suit him, and looked fucking gross, but somehow my brain thought it was hot. The worst part is, I couldn't and still can't tell which Sam he was. 

Was he the guy who told me the horrific reality of my existence? 

Or was he another recycled, mindless suitor? 

‚ÄúThis is Samuel.‚Äù Mom said, and Sam slowly stood. 

He took slow steps towards me, and kissed my hand.

I saw the slightest smudge of scarlet on his lip, but his eyes were blank. 

In the corner of my eye, my ‚Äòfather‚Äôs‚Äô eyes were glittering. 

‚ÄúHello, Brianna.‚Äù Sam said, and I *swore* Now that I was awake, the walls were wolf-whistling. Laughing. 

*""Ooooooooooooooo!‚Äù*

My town is a blip on the map. 

I keep thinking if I tear at my skin, I will find who I am underneath. 

I don't bleed. 

I don't think who I *was* still exists under so many layers. But even if this is just a cry into the void, please help us.

I typically drink two-three cups per day of coffee, normally from a local cafe (thankfully work pays). When I make coffee at the house, it‚Äôs either been through a standard coffee maker or through a metal Amazon pour over filter I bought a couple years ago and medium grinds from the grocer.

I want to move to making proper pour over cups in my house as part of a new morning schedule I‚Äôm adapting. For this, I just want to go all in and get the best experience I possibly can.

I don‚Äôt care about price but if there‚Äôs literally only the most minuscule improvement past a certain point I don‚Äôt want to spend just to spend. But please recommend whatever you truly think gets you the best cup you‚Äôve tasted.

2 days before today I was told to do low fiber food so I ate boiled potatoes no skin and lightly fried paneer aka cottage cheese with some spices. 

My prep day yesterday I had black coffee in the morning and then drank Suprep at 4-6pm, which is sodium sulfate/potassium sulfate/magnesium sulfate liquid, 
It causes several runs of diarrhea and pooping at first and then turns to yellow liquid poop almost like pee, thats how you know prep is working. I was also told to take 2 tablets of gas relief along with prep and drink more after the prep.

Today morning I had one more prep of the same Suprep with same gas relief and water. I did the prep at 10-10.30 with same outcome, yellow watery liquid poop, thats great news, your prep is working.

My procedure was at 1.30, nurse gave me a thorough details of what will be happening, including sedation, whats used for sedation, IV was inserted(just in case if some sedation was needed if signaled by me so during the procedure), vitals taken. Then doctor came and I told them I don't want the sedation and he was okay with it. 

Procedure starts, I was able to see on screen as the tube was inserted, how water infusion works and complete insides of my colon including near small intestine. I HAD NO PAIN whatsoever, it's remarkable how medical science has evolved. Just some pressure sensation because they infuse water through tube but also suck it back. They also did biopsy so I saw that as well, doctor took some samples of the colon tissue for lab test, some blood was coming in intestines because of that but doctor told it will heal in few hours. 

Overall my experience was extremely well. I had no issues with prepping, which some say is more difficult than actual procedure.

This is not a critique of the technical execution of the book (although, a once-over by an editor might have removed half the number of ‚ÄúI laughed, he laughed.‚Äù I think she was trying to convey levity, but didn‚Äôt trust the dialog to do it for her.)

that being said:

Like, I‚Äôm sorry, but that coffee shop speech she gave while he was working didn‚Äôt cut it for me (it honestly felt entitled + selfish + a little too late.)

I don‚Äôt like couples where one half is ashamed of the other, and this one made me too angry to enjoy what I‚Äôm sure the author thought was the character‚Äôs redemption. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve known too many Skylar‚Äôs in real life who fuck with the heads of the men around them (if you‚Äôve ever watched the country club sorority girl flirt with the bartender you know she‚Äôll discard once she‚Äôs had her fun with him, while he falls head over heels in love with you, you‚Äôll know how cringe it is to watch play out.), but I couldn‚Äôt love it.

Mind you, the boy is a working artist (not even like a stoned deadbeat wannabe‚Äîhe actively gets commissions for his artwork that costs thousands of dollars each, and the story makes a point of telling you that he‚Äôs overrun with commissions.) and then you casually find out that he has a trust fund bc his dad wanted to support him, and it‚Äôs like Skylar, girl.

I don‚Äôt like the gender swapped versions of her character either (MMCs who make the FMCs feel worthless while refusing to let her date anyone else), and I‚Äôd read in an interview that Amanda doesn‚Äôt like writing asshole MMCs because she wouldn‚Äôt give them the time of day in real life, and I was like girl‚Ä¶you just wrote an extremely toxic and asshole FMC to an MMC who didn‚Äôt deserve it.

1kb1sft,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1kb1sft/casual_couple_friends_or_more/,Casual couple friends or more?,"So for some context. Me and my female friend met on a Facebook game back in 2010ish. We became online friends and talked frequently. Sometimes there would be several months silence including once we went about a year without chatting but we both had a lot going at that time. 
Anyway, we even sent little gifts and cards for birthdays and holidays. We had never had any kind of voice or video chat though. Fast forward to 2021. We were texting and she mentioned her and her husband were going to take a trip to my state of Ohio‚Äîthey‚Äôre from Florida. I said if so, we could finally meet after all those years. They decided a spontaneous trip two weeks later and my husband and I were completely unprepared for it. It was a bit awkward but went well enough. I knew nothing about her husband beforehand and my husband didn‚Äôt like him at first because her husband can be very conceited and rude. Eventually though, they warmed up to each other. 

Fast forwarded to two years later when they decided to move to my state and be 45 minutes away. I‚Äôve always felt very tense around them just because I never know what to say and whether they‚Äôll be upset. They seem to get upset about the smallest things too with other people and situations. 
We are very easy to please people and will eat just about anything‚Äîthinking outside the box. It seems like they were always judging everything we‚Äôd do together and anywhere we‚Äôd eat wasn‚Äôt authentic enough or wasn‚Äôt high quality or whatever. Or they would crack jokes about Ohio or Ohioans‚Äîwhich is understandable‚Äîbut it would get annoying because they‚Äôd always compare to Germany or Spain‚Äîshe is originally from Europe but moved here after marrying her Floridian husband around the time I met her. Regardless, we‚Äôd still have a good time with them but it would create some awkwardness and tension with me and my husband. 

With that being said, anytime we‚Äôd do something with them, it was a whole day event. They‚Äôd want to eat, go somewhere like a museum, get coffee, go eat again, etc. When we would go to their house it was the same thing but with games or something. All of this is great, but we work 40+ hours and our only days off we occasionally weekends so doing a big 8-12 hour day was becoming hard. He works from home and she doesn‚Äôt have a job so they were able to do errands and chores. They also asked us to stay the night for Christmas which my husband and I made private jokes about them being swingers but everyone we talked to about it said it was a little odd given more context. 

The last time we did anything with them they had invited us over for what I thought was just lunch. It was not. They had tapas set out for lunch and later‚ÄîI guess that evening‚Äîwas to be a paella. Between the eating and coffee was going to be games and she was going to teach me a craft she does. We did not know this beforehand and had made last minute plans to attend my niece‚Äôs last play later that evening. They had to rush their paella and seemed really pissed off about it all. We were there about 5 hours before we left. The next day I sent her a text thanking them and apologizing‚Äîagain‚Äîfor leaving early. Two days later I got a response that she was really annoyed and they‚Äôd live and learn. I understand their frustration but I also feel we shouldn‚Äôt feel like hostages every time we are with them and if something came up, they should have some understanding. 

After that, there was silence for several months until my birthday when they stopped at my house and left a birthday card in my vehicle. They didn‚Äôt knock, call or text and I felt really weird about it. When I finally talked to her she said they didn‚Äôt want to stop by unannounced which I get but not even a text they stopped by? So they drove 45 minutes to put a birthday card in my vehicle? It happened again a couple months later but for Christmas. We hadn‚Äôt talked to them in over a month and a couple nights after Christmas I got a text they dropped off a bag full of really nice gifts for us but again, didn‚Äôt want to stop by unannounced. I was really creeped out by that and we both felt absolutely guilty because we didn‚Äôt get them anything. We had no idea they bought us gifts or had planned anything. It just didn‚Äôt set well with either one of us. 

One night I was googling them‚Äîin case they were on a wanted list or something, Ha!‚Äîand come to find out, she had been lying all these years about her age. She is 15 years older than me even though she had always made implications she was just a little older. I understand not wanting to talk about age, but to make implications that she was much younger was kind of strange to me given the whole story. I wouldn‚Äôt have even cared about her age as I have a wide range of ages of friends and I care about them not their age.

If you spot a really obvious editing mistake, let me know, I'm an idiot and probably forgot to edit it. HERE IT IS! 


Chapter 1

Kurt sat back in the cool leather chair and brought the coffee cup to his lips, taking a slow, long drink. He smacked his lips and sat it back down in the cupholder. His radio buzzed with chatter about this and that, but he wasn't listening. He was focused. His sharp blue eyes traced every car that passed him. The overhead road lights came on, and he backed his cruiser even further into the shadows.

He was upset. For the last three years on the job, he had given no less than one hundred tickets a year. This year, he had only 92, and December was almost over. I'll make it. I still have time. He took another sip before turning off his radio. Illegal, I know, he thought. But who's gonna see? He stroked his brown mustache. He thought it was coming along well, but he needed to keep putting on that hair grower. His cousin had pointed him in its direction, and he was pleased to say it was working well. He shifted his black uniform, and his eyes drifted toward the LED clock on his console. 12:13 PM. His shift would end soon.

As he looked up, a red streak flashed across his vision, and he heard the beep of his radar. He glanced at it with increasing interest and saw it was 127 MPH. Giddy with delight, he put his car into gear and turned on the sirens. 93, here I come. He followed the car, which he saw was a red Subaru, for a solid five minutes before he pulled up beside it and called out his window.

‚ÄúPull over now!‚Äù he shouted as he struggled to keep up speed. The car instantly stopped without so much as a second's hesitation and calmly pulled over to the side of the road. Kurt slammed on his brakes, and his car made an unpleasant noise as he turned around and pulled behind the Subaru. How the hell did it stop so fast? Kurt thought with confusion as he opened the cruiser door and slammed it behind him.

He walked up to the Subaru's window and knocked on the driver's side glass. No answer.

‚ÄúRoll down the window.‚Äù Another knock, this one forceful. No answer. He shone his flashlight on the window and saw nothing. That's one hell of a tint. He banged on the window with the butt of his flashlight while unholstering his pistol. ‚ÄúIf you don't roll down the window, I will break it.‚Äù

The window rolled down halfway before Kurt saw what was inside. He slowly lowered his light, and his hand fell off the butt of the pistol. He began to sweat with terror as the window came to a stop.

Inside the car was a body, naked and skinless, the only thing standing out besides the blood-red muscle was the mouth. The very muscle and bone of the thing's face had somehow pulled upwards to form some expression, some hellish form of a smile. Its teeth were pure black. Blood had soaked the entire seat and everything around it.

‚ÄúEvening, Kurt. Looking for a ninety-third?‚Äù the voice inside spoke.

Kurt stuttered as his mind reeled. The car door opened, and Kurt's hand flew to his pistol again, drawing it up to his shoulder. ‚ÄúSt-stay in the car! And take off that mask!‚Äù

The voice laughed, a wet, slobbery laugh that Kurt thought sounded like what a drowning boy's last breath would sound like. The door opened further, and Kurt stepped back, his hand trembling too hard to aim. In his fear, he noted the busy highway was completely devoid of traffic, and the sky was pitch black. He was alone, truly alone. With this.

As if sensing his thoughts, the voice continued to talk. ‚ÄúI've heard plenty of drowning boys. Drowned some myself. They don't sound like me.‚Äù It walked forward, and Kurt's thoughts cleared. He heard himself let off two shots that went right through the thing's chest. It showed no reaction as it continued to walk forward.

Kurt, now filled with pure terror, dropped the gun and ran back to his car. He grabbed at the cruiser's door and pulled, and a dull click rang out. Locked. Jesus Christ, it‚Äôs locked.

He heard the voice behind him. ‚ÄúYes, yes it is. Did you know you wet yourself, Kurt?‚Äù He felt a hand on his shoulder and was acutely aware that liquid was seeping through his uniform and down his chest. ‚ÄúLike a little boy. A little fucking boy. You're gonna die tonight, Kurt. You know that?‚Äù

Kurt screamed and broke free of its grip. He ran down the highway now, only afraid, barely any sense left. He thought he looked like a rabbit being chased down by a wolf. He screamed again and sobbed, sobbed like a little boy.

After what seemed like an age of running, he stopped and threw himself against the gray concrete overpass barrier, sliding down onto the asphalt. Too tired to run. He began to cry again as he heard meaty thumps he knew to be the thing‚Äôs feet. They stopped in front of him.

‚ÄúYou can't run, Kurt. You never could. Remember high school track? Kicked off the team like a little boy. A little fucking boy, Kurt.‚Äù That hand placed itself on Kurt‚Äôs neck and lifted him into the air. Not a tight grip, simply a little pressure. But the damn thing lifted him three feet off the ground anyway.

Kurt closed his eyes.

‚ÄúLook at me, Kurt. Look at me.‚Äù

Kurt shook his head and held his eyelids closed tighter.

‚ÄúLook at me before I rip your eyes out.‚Äù

Kurt cracked one eyelid, and suddenly his eyelids were forced open, some force beyond him ripping them away. He screamed as blood trickled into his eyes. The thing stepped forward until Kurt was over the edge of the barrier. He started to scream, but nothing came out.

The thing spoke again. ‚ÄúWant me to let you go, Kurt?‚Äù

Kurt nodded in his dim haze of fear. He only realized his mistake a second before he hit the ground 200 feet below.

Chapter 2

‚ÄúShit.‚Äù Carl ran his hand through his sandy blond hair as he stepped away from the body. He had been police chief for eleven years and hadn't seen anything like this before. ‚ÄúThis is the fifth damn time.‚Äù

He saw something shiny in the broken heap of meat and went to pick it up. A hand casually brushed his arm away, and Carl looked up to see James, the lead forensics investigator and his good friend. Carl had always been jealous of his casual attitude. James could eat whatever the hell he wanted and not gain any weight. He was three years younger than him, a solid 42, but showed no wrinkles on his chiseled face. His black wavy hair had no gray, and his brown skin glowed in the sun.

‚ÄúYou know the rules, chief. Body has to stay untouched.‚Äù

Carl chuckled nervously, his eyes glued to the body. ‚ÄúSorry. Slipped my mind. So, what's the details?‚Äù

James cleared his throat and began to speak. ‚ÄúName is Kurt Donald, 32. He had been out waiting in a clearing by the highway stalking speeders, last we knew. His car was found parked on the side of the overpass a few hundred yards away from all this. Looked like he had pulled somebody over, and something went wrong. We found a trail of blood leading from the space in front of his cruiser‚Äîmust have been whoever got out of the car he stopped. It goes up to the cruiser‚Äôs driver-side door and stops. It seems to pick up again right above us and goes nowhere. Don't know how it's possible. His car was unlocked, but nothing was taken, although his radio was muted. He died from the sudden impact of the ground, and his eyelids are gone.‚Äù

Carl put his hands in his hair again and sighed a long, shaky sigh. ‚ÄúYou think it's a serial killer?‚Äù

James looked down at his feet, and his clipboard fell to his side. ‚ÄúYes. I do. Eyelids gone, trail of blood, death by falling, out late at night‚Äîeverything matches the other four.‚Äù

Carl felt a dampness in his chest. A year before retirement, and I get hit with this shit. He walked over to his cruiser door and grabbed his radio. ‚ÄúAll units, head back to headquarters. We need to have a discussion.‚Äù

He leaned back out and slammed the door, leaning his arm across it and then his arms. He heard James get in his cruiser. Must be pretty bad if he doesn't have much to say. He stood for a second before getting back in and heading back to base.

Later

Carl walked up to the brown podium and grabbed the mic. ‚ÄúI'm sure by now most, if not all of you, are aware of the recent deaths of four police officers.‚Äù The crowd buzzed, and Carl saw many nods. ‚ÄúThat number, as of today, is five. Officer Kurt Donald of the 3rd division was found today. A detailed explanation of the nature of the crimes will be given by forensics leader James Cart. I'm here to give you an order. From now on, all forensic and any free officers will be devoted to the capture of this serial killer, who we have managed to keep from the media. Keep this quiet. Do not go on patrols past dark without a partner, and you are advised to not go at all. We are aware that crime does not stop after eight, so we‚Äôll have our senior officers patrol in pairs. Every officer so far has been killed on the job, but we don't want to take any chances. If you go anywhere, on the clock or off it, have a firearm. For now, let's all keep doing the best we can for this county. If any of you want to turn up for Kurt's funeral, it's on Sunday at six AM. I'll let James take over from here.‚Äù

Carl stepped away from the mic and quickly left the meeting room, the glass door cold against his hand. He had a stomachache and was sure it wasn't because he had eaten anything. The truth was, despite his collected manner during his speech, he was scared. In all his years of working, nothing had been quite like this. Blood trails that came from nowhere and led to nowhere? Five officers killed, all armed, all on the job, all never calling for backup, and all dead within three months? Scary stuff.

But what scared him the most wasn't the blood trail but the blood itself. They had run every sample from every trail three times, and all came back N/A. He remembered James walking in a circle in the forensics lab, his arms crossed, speaking to himself after the DNA results came in. He never spoke to himself unless something was really wrong, and that, Carl guessed as he sat down at his chestnut office desk and opened a container of Tums, was the core of his fear.

James was never scared. The last time he had seen James this scared was when his wife was in the hospital with cancer three years ago.

‚ÄúOh well,‚Äù Carl said to nobody in particular as he placed the Tums back in his drawer and opened his computer. ‚ÄúNo use worrying.‚Äù He paused as the glow of his computer reflected off his badge, and he looked down at his considerable stomach. His wife had been telling him for years to lay off the sweets, and he had. He felt happy again as he noticed his uniform was baggy. He‚Äôd managed to lose close to fifty pounds over the last two years, and he was losing faster, but he still wouldn't be trying out for track and field anytime soon.

He loaded up his email and was about to go through it when a scrawny intern opened the door. ‚ÄúSomebody here to see you, sir. A reporter from Anders, that town up north.‚Äù

Carl's brow furrowed. Reporter? Hadn't he kept this quiet? He grimaced. Best to get it over with if the press had found out. ‚ÄúSend him in.‚Äù

A hand, half as large as the intern's head, plopped down on his shoulder, and the intern jumped. ‚ÄúDidn't mean to scare ya, kid.‚Äù The intern ducked out of his grip and quickly walked off.

The hand‚Äôs owner walked through the door, and Carl's first impression of him was something like the Incredible Hulk. The man was easily six feet seven minimum, and he was as large as the door frame. He was wearing a brown detective's coat and had on a brown fedora. His face was tight, as if it was a piece of clothing too small on a body too large. When Carl thought about it later, he was almost sure that was what it was.

The man smiled, and Carl saw he had no facial hair. His eyes were a striking purplish color, and his hair was as brown as his hat. He looked like a child's idea of a detective, like a costume.

The man sat down in the chair in front of Carl's desk, and he thought he saw it dent under the man's weight. He stuck out his hand. ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Anderson. And don't worry, I'm not that kind of reporter. I work for the Anders police department as an intern. We recently had an officer die like your officers. I thought I would collect details, maybe team up with your interns with your permission. Pleased to meet you regardless.‚Äù

Carl shook his hand and noted his grip was firm but gentle. ‚ÄúSame. My name is Carl, although you probably already know that.‚Äù

Anderson laughed, and for some reason, Carl was afraid again. That is not a human laugh, some voice inside him said. Carl pushed the voice away.

‚ÄúSo, what questions do you have?‚Äù

Anderson shifted in his chair and spoke in a firm and gentle voice, much like his handshake. ‚ÄúWell, for starters, I'd like to know how your staff is feeling about this. Is morale low?‚Äù

Carl thought that was an odd question but answered honestly. ‚ÄúMorale is pretty low, but with your department's help, we could catch this guy. And teaming up would give a pretty good boost.‚Äù

Anderson seemed to smile wider as Carl told him about morale. Carl noticed his eyes. They were not like any eyes he had ever seen. They tracked him, always, never deviating from his own. And they seemed dead. The eyes are the window to the soul. Carl didn't know who had said that, but he did know something else. What was behind those eyes was anything but a soul.

Chapter 3

Around an hour had passed since Anderson left, and Carl was very unnerved. He didn't know what to make of Anderson. He had been gentle, his voice soothing, his aura one of comfort and safety. But those eyes, that skin, that way he had of speaking like a man who had just learned English while somehow talking smoothly‚Äînothing about him made Carl feel safe.

He turned his computer on again and went to the Anders police employee record. Anderson from the Anders police department. More weird shit. He typed in Anderson's first name into the record but stopped. He never told me his last name.

He looked back at the screen with fear in his heart. Turns out, he didn't need a last name. There wasn't, and had never been, a man named Anderson employed by the Anders police department.

Carl jumped out of his seat and ran out of his office to the security room, bursting into the cold cement chamber. The lights were off, and he saw the three men that had been chosen to watch the cameras that day were watching Die Hard. Carl absentmindedly thought it was a bit too late for Christmas movies. New Year‚Äôs would be appropriate.

‚ÄúGet off the damn movie and run the front parking lot cameras, two hours ago.‚Äù

One of the men, who had red hair and was pale as chalk, ran the footage back. He set it to 1.5X speed. Carl watched. And watched.

‚ÄúSpeed it up.‚Äù

The pale man set it to 2X. Nothing. He glanced up at the camera‚Äôs time display and saw it was 2:14. Fourteen minutes after the man had first entered his office.

‚ÄúRun it back.‚Äù Nothing.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù Carl said under his breath. He had them run it at three, the time Anderson had left, and Carl had watched him drive off in his red Subaru. Nothing again.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù Carl asked again, this time louder.

The pale security man spoke. ‚ÄúLooking for something in particular, sir?‚Äù

Carl nodded aggressively. ‚ÄúA red Subaru and a big-ass dude. Impossible to miss. Are you sure these are from today?‚Äù

Pale boy zoomed in on the upper corner of the footage, where the time, date, and other things always sat. Carl saw with dismay it was the right day. He thought he could feel his face going colorless. If nobody came in, and nobody came out, who the hell was in my office?

In the irrational circumstances he was in, his brain was apt to find a rational explanation. So he thought for a moment. ‚ÄúHas anybody come in here in the past few hours? Anyone suspicious asking to have access to the tapes?‚Äù

Pale boy shook his head. ‚ÄúNo sir. We don't let anyone in unless they get your permission. Need us to do anything else?‚Äù

Carl‚Äôs head was racing. It's happening too fast, he thought absurdly. In the movies, there's always a calm before the storm. Where's the calm?

‚ÄúNo, I'm good. Thanks for your time.‚Äù

Carl left before security could answer him, letting the steel door slam shut behind him. I just need rest, that's all. Some time to think everything over.

He went back to his office and grabbed his things before wishing the secretaries goodbye and starting his walk home. He lived only a five-minute drive away, but with an uphill walk like this, it would take him a half-hour to walk home. He started doing it to lose weight, and he thought he could feel the calories burning away. But today, he didn't feel that.

As he walked home in the cool winter breeze, a cloudy sky with no snow, he thought about Anderson. I just had a conversation with a serial killer. I'm sure of that now. And the cameras‚Ä¶ somebody on the inside has to be working with him. Why didn't I report that? My god. That man‚Ä¶ a fucking mountain of a man, and nobody saw him but me and that intern? Something's very wrong with this picture.

‚ÄúHello, Carl.‚Äù

Carl flinched and almost lost his footing on the sidewalk when the voice scared him out of his thoughts, but a hand stuck out and grabbed him before he fell. In the second it took him to look up, he was afraid he would see the face of Anderson, grinning with that stretched mouth and empty eyes. But it was just one of the Yang brothers.

A local cult that had been around for years. They hadn't caused any trouble after the bunker raid a few years back. Now they just walked around in their white robes, screaming about the end times. This one in particular Carl had seen several times.

‚ÄúHaving trouble in the office, eh? You almost fell. Your face tells a story, you know. Trouble is ahead. Yang knows this, and we can fight it. Nevermind the raid, Carl. Join us! The brothers are eager to have a new recruit.‚Äù

Carl threw the hand out to the brother‚Äôs side. ‚ÄúLeave me alone. Though I told you last time to never speak to me again.‚Äù

Carl said this with the intent of making the man angry, perhaps so he would slip up and give Carl the chance to arrest him. But the brother‚Äôs face looked thoughtful, and he followed Carl as he walked up the hill once more.

‚ÄúCome on, Carl. You know we're right. I see it in your face. You look like you just had a visit with the devil.‚Äù

Carl whirled around. A visit with the devil. That was exactly what he had had, one way or another. He grabbed the Yang brother by his hood and held him.

‚ÄúShut the fuck up. Just shut up. I've dealt with enough shit today for the rest of my life, and you're making it worse. Why don't you go find Yin and shove him up your ass?‚Äù

He shoved the brother away, and when he turned around, his face was no longer thoughtful. It was malevolent and foreboding.

‚ÄúYou have no idea what's coming, just like how you have no idea what is already here. You wonder where the calm was. But was it ever there? Or were you choosing to ignore the storm floating all around you? Hell is cold, you know. We speak to the devil. You think you know the truth of your existence. But you don't, and you never will. Or, perhaps, you will. It is not my say. That saying belongs to Him. And you would be advised to stay on His side. Meeting the devil is only the introduction to hell, you know. At its core, hell is dark. A dark void with nothing and nobody. When you end there, you will feel nothing. You will be nothing. Because the dark wills it so. Watch your lights. Or, rather, watch the places your light does not touch. You may find something there you will never find again.‚Äù

The brother pulled his hood back over his head, and his face sunk into darkness. He walked away.

Carl stood for a long time. He didn't move. He simply thought. And in his thoughts, he came away with one stupid thought. One human thought, something a little boy would find in that long speech from the brother.

I should sleep with my lights on tonight.

He walked the rest of the way home in silence, with no thoughts in his head other than Yang and Him. Who was Him? God? Or the other one? Carl believed Yang spoke of the latter. But he laughed off the implication that this was anything but a simple criminal who needed to be caught because, after all, he was a cop. He caught bad guys. So he should catch a bad guy.

Tomorrow, he thought, trying to put his troubles behind him, tomorrow I'll worry.

Later

Carl hit the raw chicken with the meat hammer. Up and down, up and down, tenderizing it. He set the hammer down and picked up the cutting board with the chicken on it, carrying the brown piece of wood over to the crock pot and slid the chicken into the black pot and hit the on button.

The smell of soup filled the room, and he went and sat at the dinner table. Alone. There were two other chairs at the table, and only one of them had been used the past three years.

His wife had left him for another man three years ago and officially divorced him two years ago. His son Sam had died four years ago, and that was the source of the trouble. He had drowned on his way home from school, probably walking along the sidewalk, not a care in his eleven-year-old head, when something happened. A simple trip, or maybe, just maybe, a push had ended up with him falling off the sidewalk and slamming his head on the concrete before sliding into a ditch filled with water.

He had been found facedown, his Minecraft backpack filled with water. His wife blamed him. He was supposed to take him home that day, but he told him in the morning it wasn't too slick to walk home and wasn't too wet. He assured him he would be fine.

Carl was aware he was crying at the table, alone. And that thought only made him cry more.

He supposed he was lucky. He never turned to cigarettes or alcohol. Rather, he drowned himself, much like his son, in his work. He helped run thirteen different major busts that year. Seven more than average. His wife said he was a machine, more devoted to his work than her. He supposed she was right in the end.

His sorrow was not for her, who he had always harbored neutral feelings for, but for Sam. He had loved Sam with all his heart. He had never loved anyone as much as him and most likely never would again.

Lost in sorrow, he cried, for how long he did not know. He was finally broken from his prison of memory by the long beep that signaled the crockpot was ready. He opened his eyes, red and blurry from tears, and went over to it. He grabbed the lid and carefully lifted it off. He set it on the marble counter, and shredded the chicken before placing the lid back on and starting it again.

Then he realized.

He lived in a small neighborhood on the outskirts of the main city, but he always heard the drone of the highway and passing cars, always heard the birds chirping, always heard people walking their dog. But he heard nothing.

He went to his window and opened it. It was dark.

He wasn‚Äôt hungry anymore.

It was just four. I swear to god it was just four‚Ä¶ He looked at his microwave clock. It was three in the morning.

What the hell was happening?

Suddenly, he heard the long and somewhat dramatic creak of a door opening in the hallway. The lightbulb above his head glowed fiercely until it was brighter than the sun, and Carl shielded his eyes from its all-encompassing glow. Then it shattered, and every light in the house shattered with it.

He heard the crockpot explode too, and his back was covered with a fiercely hot liquid. Carl screamed and pawed at his back before running into the hall shower and turning on the water, not caring that he was still clothed.

But it didn't stop. He continued to burn.

The shower door slammed shut, and the water began to fill the tub. Carl continued to scream until he was hoarse. He turned off the water, but it didn't work‚Äîthe shower head kept pouring and pouring, until his ankles were covered. Then his knees, then his legs, then his chest‚Ä¶

As the water approached his head, he heard laughter.

The water stopped. The burning stopped.

He heard meaty thumps coming from the hallway, and he was suddenly overcome with fear so thick he felt as if the parts of him not underwater had become submerged too. A primal fear.

The thumps continued until they stopped right outside the cherry wooden door, and he heard a fierce snap as whatever was outside his door punched a hole through it. It reached in, only a silhouette in the darkness which continued to accompany Carl, and ripped the doorknob off.

The door slowly swung open.

The room became filled with pure malevolence, pure hatred, pure cynicism. Then a laugh. It was a horrible laugh, like the thing's throat was submerged. Like it was drowning.

Carl became sure of something then. It was Him. The thing the Yang brother referred to.

And then it was there.

It stood against the darkness, somehow glowing without producing any light. Carl saw Him with shocking clarity. He was tall, taller than Carl. He looked down at him. He was naked, skinless, his muscles flexing as if they were separate entities. He was relatively fit, and he reminded him of the anatomy dolls they had in high school.

But his face was what differed. Instead of eyes, there were two huge pits, each blacker than black but each with a piercing purple light where the pupil should be, like a laser pointer. At first, Carl thought He had no teeth, but he did. They were black.

He dripped blood‚Äîno, poured it‚Äîas if he truly had just been skinned.

The purple lights locked on Carl.

‚ÄúHaving a good time, Carl? I know I am. And don't try to talk, you won't be able to.‚Äù

Carl tried anyway, but nothing came.

‚ÄúI won't stay long. Don't worry. I just have a message for you.‚Äù The thing comically cleared its throat. When it spoke, it spoke with sharp hatred.

‚ÄúYou are nothing, Carl. Nothing. You are a small, fat, little nothing. You try so hard to be something, but you can't. I will make you suffer. I will make others suffer. But that is not my purpose here. You spoke earlier of the calm. So did Yang. But you both got it wrong. The calm has been your whole life. So ask yourself, Carl, if your forty years of existence have been calm, what is the storm?‚Äù

He smiled wider.

‚ÄúYou'll find out soon, my friend. Oh, and Sam says hi. He told me to make you understand him a little better.‚Äù

The water turned on again and didn't stop. It went over his head.

As Carl screamed for air and banged the glass and spasmed and choked, he saw Him through the glass.

He never stopped smiling.

Interlude: Limbo

Carl was in a field. It was a great field, green and sunny in that way only matched by the vibrance of neon, the sky clear and sunny. It felt as if he was standing in some great memory, some lost child's memory of summer. The field stretched endlessly in every direction, and he heard the chirp of birds despite the fact no birds were there.

He turned in every direction, the light stinging his eyes, and he shielded them with his hands for a second before putting them down.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù he called out. ‚ÄúIs anyone here?‚Äù

As he was about to call again, he felt a charge run through his body, not one of electricity but of light, and he suddenly felt safe. Like nothing could touch him.

He heard the angelic sound of trumpets and saw the sky split open and an angel descend from the glowing rift exactly like something out of a cartoon.

The angel was beautiful, a woman with fine blond hair, white wings, and a white robe. Her face looked too perfect to truly exist, as if she was not real but a stone statue shaped by the hands of Michelangelo. Her skin was glowing with holy light, and her wonderful hair flowed down to her shoulders. Her eyes were a perfect sea green, and they focused on Carl with a warm light.

She touched down and smiled at Carl. He suddenly felt as if he was an intruder, like his imperfect human form was not worthy of meeting this radiating figure. He became embarrassed, but when she spoke, he instantly felt as if she was speaking to an old friend.

‚ÄúHello, Carl. My name is Yin. I appear to you in this form because it is one humans commonly associate with safety.‚Äù She brushed a strand of blond hair from her angelic face before continuing. ‚ÄúYou must have oh so many questions. Come, sit, let us talk.‚Äù

A round marble table materialized in front of him, and he was aware a bench had appeared behind him and Yin. He sat on the marble bench, bracing for the cold. It was warm and comfortable, as if it was feathers instead of stone.

Carl felt in awe of Yin, felt amazed and confused and not a little excited. He remembered he had read The Hobbit as a teen and chuckled inwardly as he thought that he and Bilbo might not be in different circumstances.

He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúI do, your holiness. Could I ask why I was chosen to be here?‚Äù

Yin laughed, and Carl thought it to be the polar opposite of His laugh. His laugh was cruel and wet and full of hatred. Simply thinking of it was enough to make Carl want to scream. Yin‚Äôs laugh was one of kindness, of safety and care, unmatched in happiness.

She spread her hands outward as she spoke. ‚ÄúYou are in Limbo, Carl. Limbo is a place in between my kingdom‚Ä¶‚Äù She stopped for a second, and her smile faltered. ‚ÄúAnd His kingdom. Right now, this is a place of good. I chose this because I believe it is the perfect place to have a conversation with a friend. But back to your question. You may be expecting some grand answer, but truthfully, you were not chosen by me or Him. You were chosen by something else.‚Äù

Carl thought about this with his hands on the table. He didn't much care now how he was chosen, but what was to come.

‚ÄúWhat is going on?‚Äù he asked.

Yin placed her hands calmly together on the table in front of her, and her mesmerizing green eyes stared into Carl with apprehension. ‚ÄúA storm is coming, much like that man told you. The hooded one. I can't tell you what will happen or why‚Äîyou must find that out yourself if you are to succeed. But what I can tell you is that a war has begun. And you will be my only soldier.‚Äù

She looked on the verge of tears, and Carl felt immensely afraid. A god was crying in front of him, and that did not mean well.

‚ÄúI feel immensely guilty for having to put you in such a position, but you must understand it was not my choice. It was my father‚Äôs. Eventually, you will learn of my father and the other one. Him. But you will learn in time. I will be with you on your journey.‚Äù

Carl sat, dismayed. Why him? Does he not have enough on his hands with the killer running loose and his sadness? Now he must be thrust into some war of the gods? It all felt unfair. But he did not say that. Instead, he said something else.

‚ÄúI'll do it. But when it‚Äôs over, what do I get?‚Äù

Yin shook her head and smiled sadly. ‚ÄúNothing, or maybe something. It isn't for me to know. But you must trust, Carl. Trust I will guide you.‚Äù

Carl stood up and held out his hand. Yin stood up and held her hand out. When Carl went to shake, she retracted it with a playful smile.

‚ÄúI have faith that you will accomplish your goals as well as mine, Carl. I believe this partnership is a lasting one. And I will show you some of my power as proof of my status.‚Äù

She held out her other hand, and a bolt of electricity shot from it and into Carl‚Äôs stomach. He felt something change. At the same time, Yin offered her hand again, and Carl took it.

Yin's eyes went white, and she began to ascend and speak in a voice not her own.

Every mishap, every humiliating moment, every twist of fate that turns my life into a series of unfortunate events. Why? Because my fans *love it!* They can't get enough of my misery. I suppose at this point, I can't either.

Today started like any other. I stepped out of my apartment, camera in hand, ready to document whatever calamity the universe had in store today.

The first disaster struck before I reached the end of my street. A pigeon, swooping low, relieved itself right on my head. I grimaced, feeling the warm, sticky mess seeping through my hair. Perfect. The camera captured it all. My fans will love it.

I kept walking, late for my coffee date. As I rushed, my foot caught on an uneven pavement slab. I sprawled onto the ground, hands and knees scraping against the rough surface. Painful, but great content.

The day continued in a blur of small catastrophes; A car splashed through a puddle, drenching me from head to toe. I dropped my phone in the toilet. Stuff like that.

As night fell, I headed home, exhausted from the insanely bad day, but...satisfied. Little did I know, the day's final misfortune was yet to come.

My phone buzzed.

A notification from an unknown number.

A text.

***""I'm watching you.""***

I laughed it off. A prank, surely. Just another fan trying to spook me. It wouldn't be the first time. But as I turned the corner, I stopped dead in my tracks. A hundred-feet away, a figure stood in the shadow of a tree, staring directly at me. I fumbled with my camera, trying to get a better shot. I had to capture this. My fans had to see. I raised the camera, focusing on the hooded figure.

Suddenly, headlights blazed to life behind me. I turned, momentarily blinded. A car, speeding towards me.

I jumped out of the way, but the car clipped my shoulder, sending me sprawling into the road. Pain radiated through my arm. I groaned, trying to sit up, the camera still rolling. The driver jumped out, rushing towards me, apologies tumbling from his lips. ""I'm sorry-I'm sorry-I'm sorry! Are you okay?""

Before I could respond, a new sound pierced the night. The roar of another engine, louder this time. I turned my head, eyes widening in horror. A truck, barreling down the dark street, heading straight for us.

The driver of the car screamed, trying to pull me to safety. But I was locked in place, transfixed, staring through the lens, capturing every second.

The truck collided with the car with an almighty crunch, travelling 60 feet before screeching to a stop...with me sandwiched between them.

The impact crushed my entire body, leaving just my neck, shoulders and head exposed.

As my guts slowly spilled onto the ground and I quickly realised my fate, my final thought was a twisted sense of glory and satisfaction;

I'm hoping that writing it all down will help me clear my head enough to finally get some rest, and maybe some of you will have advice on steps I can take beyond the reports I've already filed. Since this is technically part of an ongoing investigation, I hope you understand why I'm keeping the details vague.¬†

I (21F) have attended the same out-of-state college for the past four years. I'm a senior now, and have worked part-time as a barista since sophomore year. It was a great gig up until a few days ago.¬†

Every once in a while, I would get hit on by a patron, but it never escalated beyond a few creepy comments. I had previously never felt unsafe at my workplace, especially with all of my coworkers and regulars around. Two days ago, however, a coworker of mine came up to me and said: ""Hey, that guy at Table 10 has been staring at you for a really long time. Do you two know each other?""

I looked at the corner table and immediately saw the patron in question. He was easy to spot for two reasons: he was more disheveled than our usual clientele, and like my coworker said, he was looking directly at me. I expected a suggestive smile, but instead, the man's expression was one of shock. He looked like he'd seen a ghost. After an awkward staring contest, he rose from his seat and approached the counter.¬†

The man was older, maybe in his sixties, with large eyes and thick, worm-like lips. Before I could do my usual spiel‚Äî""How was the drink, sir? Can I help you out with anything else today?""‚Äîthe man said, ""Angelica?""¬†

""That's not my name, sorry.""¬†

""Oh, of course. It's only a stage name, I suppose?"" His voice was soft and high-pitched, as if atrophied. I had no clue what he was talking about and told him as much, albeit in more polite terms. What followed was a brief but frustrating back and forth; the man, seemingly convinced that I was someone else, kept asking me about a video series that he'd supposedly seen me in. Specifically, he seemed interested in commissioning me for a video. By the way he danced around the exact content of said videos, I had a feeling that he was alluding to pornography.¬†

""Sorry, this is awkward,"" I said after coming to this realization. ""But it sounds like I might have some kind of doppelganger in the ‚Ä¶ *adult film* space\*.\* I don't make any videos, never have. I think this is just an unfortunate coincidence.""¬†

At this, the man went quiet, sighing as though collecting himself. After a moment, he gave me a smile and a wink. I remember his eyelids audibly clicking as they opened and shut. He then took his phone out of his pocket, spent a minute searching for something, and then held the phone out to me. I don't know what got into me exactly‚Äîsheer curiosity, I guess‚Äîbut I took the phone from his hands to look at the image he'd pulled up.¬†

On the greasy screen was a photo of a young woman in an empty white room. The lighting was harsh and flat, lending an uncanny effect to an already bizarre composition. The woman stood close enough to the camera that you could only see her body from the waist up. She held her arm out towards the camera, showing off what seemed to be a puncture wound on her forearm. There was a large bruise encircling the area, and the wound itself was clearly infected, caked with old blood and pus. I looked up from the arm to her face, and despite the strange lighting, I was shocked by how much it looked like my own. She had my eye color and shape, my nose, my jaw, even my freckles. I dropped the phone onto the counter with a gasp and the man scrambled to pick it up.¬†

""What the fuck is that? Where did you get this photo!?"" I shouted, losing all pretense of nonchalance. The cafe went quiet, customers looking over at us and a few of my coworkers stepping closer to me. Seeing this, the man scowled and began muttering under his breath. I only caught a few words: ""uppity bitch"" and ""good money"" among them. He exited the shop in a huff, leaving an untouched cup of coffee on the corner table.¬†

After he left, I took 15 in the break room to compose myself. The photograph of the woman burned in my mind's eye. This ""Angelica,"" if that was actually her name, seriously could have been my long-lost twin. I pulled out my phone and did a preliminary search for the photo, but I saw nothing that looked remotely similar. I resolved to do a more thorough investigation once I returned home and had access to a computer. I made it through the rest of my evening without further incident.¬†

I worked the closing shift that day: 2 to 10 at night. I had plenty of time to reflect during my thirty minute drive home. Embarrassing as it is to admit, I was a former pageant kid. I competed for most of my childhood, at the behest of my former beauty-queen mother. As a teenager, my mom tried to get me into modelling. It never went anywhere, but the amount of times my parents made me sit for digitals gave me some long-term scopophobia. To this day, I don't have any public social media as a result. I think anyone would be disturbed if a stranger confronted them in the way my patron did me, but my background made the experience impossible to shrug off. I needed to figure out who the hell this ""Angelica"" woman was, even if I knew I might not like what I discovered.¬†

At 10:45, I sat down at my desk with nothing but a bottle of wine and a woman's name. For a full hour, I poked around on the web to no avail. I started off with searches like ""Angelica arm puncture wound video"" and ""Angelica arm white room"" and then tried more detailed queries. I searched around increasingly obscure forums dedicated to all manner of topics from body horror art to grotesque auto-portraiture photography. Several drinks later, it occurred to me that I might be conducting my investigation in the wrong place‚Äîmore specifically, on the wrong layer of the web. I hadn't wanted to confront the notion previously, but there was a chance that Angelica was producing some kind of self-harm fetish content, and if that were the case, I wasn't sure how much I'd find about her content on the surface web.¬†

Since I don't want anyone reading this to go on to search for the website, I'm not going to get into the details. I will say, though, that once I got onto Dread, it wasn't nearly as hard to find as I thought. By midnight, I had found what I was looking for.¬†

The website's homepage was minimalistic‚Äîwhite text on a pure black background. At the top was a heading, ""**ANG3LiKKA**"", and a selfie of the eponymous woman. Seeing a brief glimpse of her at the cafe had been one thing, but it was another to carefully study her likeness. She looked so similar to myself that I felt like my brain was glitching. Hell, she even *posed* like me; the selfie looked like it could've been lifted right off of my Instagram. Beneath the photo was some introductory text:¬†

**angelica. 8teen. i <3 my fans!! no longer accepting commissions.**¬†

**price varies on a per-video, per-photoset basis.**

**click title for duration/thumbnail/price info.**

**!!! VIDEOS BEFORE 1/14/22 DO NOT HAVE AUDIO !!!**

**!!! NO REFUNDS !!!**¬†

Beneath the introductory text was a subheading that read ""free sample"", and beneath that was an embedded video, two minutes in duration.¬†

I pressed play. The video buffered for a while, then began. It faded from black into a familiar shot. In the same white room I'd seen in the customer's picture, there she stood. She‚Äî""Angelica""‚Äîlooked *awful*, far worse that she'd looked in the photograph. Her jaw clenched and unclenched strangely and her eyes were wide and darting, like a wild animal's. There was a giant, half-healed gash in her cheek and her left arm was covered in bandages, perhaps suggesting that this video was filmed after the customer's photo was taken.¬†¬†¬†

The woman wearing my face gave the camera an uncertain smile. She held up a hand, showing her palm, then turning it around to show the back. She then slowly set her hand palm-down on a small wooden table below her. The camera tilted downwards, following her hand in such a way that indicated another person was filming with a handheld. The camera lingered on her hand for a moment. I heard someone inhale. And then, a hammer came down on the woman's hand.¬†

After the blow, the camera jerked back up to her face. She started making this pained moaning sound. Her mouth twisted and I saw tears welling up in her eyes. The camera moved back down to her hand, where a deep bruise was already welling up under her skin. I paused the video here to scroll down, reading through the myriad of titles listed beneath it. The most recent link was called ""blunt force 33"", followed by ""blunt force 32"", ""puncture 12"".

""eye infection"".¬†

""needles under nails"".¬†

I felt dizzy. I had to stand up and pace around the room to keep from puking my guts out. Maybe I should've stopped there, but for whatever reason, I felt like I had some responsibility to finish. I pressed play once more.¬†

Down again came the hammer, this time landing atop the knuckle of her forefinger with a *crack*. Four more blows rained down on the hand, one for each knuckle. By the end, the sounds coming from the woman didn't seem entirely human. It didn't sound like me, but it was hard to tell. I'd never been in that kind of pain before. I didn't know what I'd sound like.

In the last few seconds of the video, the camera was raised and angled downwards such that you could see both ""Angelica's"" face and mangled hand. The shot gave the viewer a better view of her chest and the small, spade-shaped birthmark a few inches beneath her clavicle. It was this all-too-familiar mark that removed any lingering ambiguity about what I was watching. Angelica was no coincidence, no circumstantial doppelganger.¬†

She was a deepfake of *me.*

When the video ended, I sat staring at the final frame until my laptop went to sleep, too shocked to do anything else. I couldn't believe what was happening to me. I still can't. I've done everything ""right"": all my life I've kept my socials private and generally minded my own business. I've stayed modest, low-profile, and out of the spotlight for all of my young adulthood. I never even sent nudes to my ex-boyfriend, despite his insistence, because I was afraid of what would happen to them if we ever had a nasty breakup.¬†¬†¬†

As it turned out, we did have a messy breakup. In the immediate aftermath of that video, as I wracked my memory for answers, I couldn't help but think of my ex. If I were a public figure, then the culprit behind the deep fakes could've been anyone; but for a nobody like me, it had to be someone close. Someone with access to my private photos. The thought made me shudder. Could my ex really have taken things that far? Did he actually hate me that much?¬†

Not knowing what else to do, I called my dad, who surprisingly picked up the phone at 12:30 in the morning. Explaining my discovery aloud is what finally brought me to tears. I knew that I had done nothing wrong, but admitting what I'd found to him still made me feel guilty.¬†

My dad (and mom, who I heard join him after a few seconds) listened to my explanation in what I assumed was stunned silence. They hardly said a word until I'd finished my story, and then they started to ask questions.¬†

*Do you know who might've done this?* Potentially my ex, but nothing's for certain.¬†¬†

*Have you reported this to anyone?* Not yet, but I'm looking at the proper channels right now.¬†

*Do you need to come home?* Maybe.¬†

Honestly, I expected more rage, especially from my dad, but he was probably just as shocked as I was. The two of them consoled me to the best of their ability, then suggested I get some rest and submit a report in the morning. They also cautioned me against discussing the situation with my friends, since the culprit could potentially be anyone.

I heeded their advice. I spent a few hours trying to get some sleep, slipping in and out of awful nightmares. In between these bouts, I spent my time researching deep fakes, revenge porn, and how to report what I had found. I told no one besides my parents, nor did I immediately begin my report to the Internet Crime Complaint Center.
