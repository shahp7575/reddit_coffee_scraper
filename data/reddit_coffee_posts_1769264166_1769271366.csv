1qlr32e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1qlr32e/wife_addicted_to_media/,Wife addicted to media,"I just have to get this out somewhere right now or I’m going to lose my mind…

My wife has always watched a lot of TV, according to her stomach from the fact that nobody was ever in her house when she was a kid and so she used to have it on as company.

Now with phones it’s gotten so much worse. Basically the second she wakes up, she’s watching some kind of media or listening to a podcast, etc., and literally at all times throughout the day. I would estimate 80 to 90% of any given day, there is some media playing in her ear.

If I were to mention this to her in a serious way, she would get defensive and probably angry, and it would do basically no good. I’ve made small mentions of it before and it’s that type of reaction.

She’s already very ADD, and I feel like this just exacerbates it.

To make it worse, whenever my daughter isn’t doing anything, she’s “bed rotting” like so many teens these days, and my wife doesn’t see an issue with it. So for example, if she stays home from school and I’m working, they’ll both just literally be in separate rooms 90% of the day watching media, except maybe half an hour to get a coffee together or something. And if I say anything about it, and she would be like you’re working, let me manage the household, or whatever.

I feel like it’s a hard issue to deal with because it’s so prevalent these days. Maybe not quite to this extent for everybody, but certainly most people are addicted to their phones.

It’s just painful to watch and hard to explain why I think it’s so detrimental. But it simply cannot be good to have an external source of information or entertainment inputting into your mind every second of the day.",1,1769271323.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

I’m working on a project called **Helmet Brew**. The idea is simple: a high-end, experience-driven coffee shop designed to look like a massive, futuristic motorcycle helmet. It’s meant to be a landmark and a hub for the biking community.

I have the visual concept, branding, and a basic business model ready, but I don’t want to go at it alone. I’m looking for a partner to help me bring this to life.

**I’m looking for someone who:**

* Has experience in operations or tech (bonus points if you're a rider!).
* Is excited about building a unique ""destination"" brand.
* Wants to be a hands-on co-founder.

I’m currently focusing on the design and strategy. If you’re into motorcycles or just love unique architectural projects, I’d love to chat and show you more.

* Dual mode: Since the community was [split](https://github.com/orgs/journiv/discussions/64) ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/immich/comments/1orsrbm/journiv_010beta4_with_oidc_is_out_and_a_sneak/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/immich/comments/1onj6ay/journiv_011beta_is_out_a_selfhosted_privacyfirst/)) on link vs copy, Journiv supports both mode.
* Link Mode: Journiv will store references to Immich assets and also add them in an album called Journiv in you immich profile so you can easily see all the assets used in your journal.
* Copy Mode: Journiv copies the original assets in it's media storage so you always have them in Journiv as a copy.
* Linkbacks: If an assets in your journal entry came from Journiv then Journiv shows you an option to jump back to that asset in Immich with a single click (well if we are counting it is two clicks :))
* Immich Picker: Journiv has a integrated immich picker which allow you to browse all your immich assets within Journiv.
* Principle of least privilege: Journiv Immich integration has been designed with principle of least privilege and require a [minimal set of permission](https://www.journiv.com/docs/guides/immich-integration#permissions-reference) on the API key to function.
* Many more features, bug fixes, enhancements. 
* I also wrote a [blogpost](https://www.journiv.com/blog/engineering-journiv-scaling-media) about this development.
* Yesterday was a [big day for Journiv and me](https://www.reddit.com/r/Journiv/comments/1qledoc/special_day_for_journiv/): Alex Tran [u/altran1502](https://www.reddit.com/user/altran1502/), the founder of [Immich](https://immich.app/) became a Github sponsor of Journiv.

1qlqzld,https://i.redd.it/48ikky1dnbfg1.jpeg,My veneer journey,"I naturally had a cross bite and teeth that are small, because of that, I always felt like I had gremlin teeth. Now looking back, the correct method would have been jaw surgery, teeth straightening, then whitening. But I went a different route and just want to share my journey in case people are interested in the procedure. 

I didn’t go for the jaw surgery because it would have costed 3 times what I have done instead, before any dental work. Plus I didn’t want to endure the recovery. I’m not too affected cosmetically from the cross bite — my face isn’t that unsymmetrical from the outside, and my smile only shows my top teeth (hence the awkward pose in these pictures, I have to open my mouth really weird to show both the top and bottom), so my cross bite isn’t too visible on a day to day basis. 

The middle picture was composite bonding. I regret doing it and not going straight to veneers. I had the bonding done in NYC for $6500 in 2020. It lasted me about five years before the cracking, the discoloration in the gaps (the composite material collects color from coffee at a 10x speed than your natural teeth, and whitening doesn’t work on them). The only good side was it slightly elongated my teeth so my teeth didn’t look so tiny like before, and I was able to fix the crooked front tooth by shaving it down a little. 

I got the porcelain veneers (last pic) done last year in miami for $8600. I’m really happy with it because the dentist listened to me about the want for opaqueness and a “natural” shape, instead of the really square and not see through like most veneers you see done in the U.S. I admit I went a little whiter than I should — 5 years with paper white composite bonding made me not used to a more yellow color. But the work was good. And none of my teeth were shaved besides the top crooked one, which was important to me, so that in case something happens or I change my mind, I can remove them and have functional front teeth instead of the one that’ll need just a bit of bonding.

1qlqzjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1qlqzjj/sorce_scents_overview_for_anyone_looking_to_blind/,Sorce Scents Overview for anyone looking to blind buy,"Ok so I definitely fell into the Sorce hype over the holidays when their shop was closed and I went a bit overboard on Mercari blind buying all of their scents lol. There were some big hits and major misses so I'd thought I'd write all of my thoughts down here to maybe help someone out before spending your money :) I'd say this house is not very blind buy safe but they make some MAGICAL scents so please don't make the same mistakes I made and sample before you buy a full size lol.

A bit about me, I have a very broad range of scents I like - wouldn't categorize myself as loving one specific genre over another. I am not great at romantically describing every sent profile, I will just tell you what it smells like in simple terms to get the point across as straight forward as possible.

2AM in Lafayette - straight up bakery and coffee. Suuuper gourmand and heavy, like almost browned butter. Was not for me as I prefer lighter/vanilla gourmands.

English Major - Lighter vanilla with that ""booky"" smell - pretty pleasant but I can see if coming off a bit ""grandma"" to people. I liked it and kept it!

IDAFT - I bought the Vanilla and Blueberry. Vanilla is def the way to go here if you prefer a classic vanilla scent, super pleasant and fluffy vanilla. Blueberry smelled like straight up blueberry pop tart/gummy candy - I sold it bc it was way too juvenile/fake fruit smell for my taste.

Where the wild things grow 1 - Strawberry! Like literal gummy strawberry in a bottle lol. It is not for me but if you like straight up fruit scents - that's what this is!

This is not a love spell - I think this uses the same blueberry accord that IDAFT Blueberry does because on skin/first spray they smell very similar. This is just a tad more tarte without the vanilla to ground it. Blueberry and tarte. I dont think you need both this and IDAFT Blueberry.

A witches valentine - this came off super powdery rose to me. If you like powdery scents, you'd like this. I didn't get as much marshmallow as I would've liked to but this was pleasant to smell, again, just pretty powdery/dusty.

Venus in Fleurs - this went suuuuper juicy mango on me - almost too close to a body spray/cleaning supplies for my taste. That ""humidity"" grounded it a little bit on the dry down but its mango through and through.

Vampire Wife - LOVE this. This may be their most underrated scent. Its a perfect blend of blood orange and cake in the most wearable way. I've never smelled a cake fragrance done so well. This is in my top 3.

The bees - Honey! Really pretty and wearable but I'd say its def one of their more ""commercial"" leaning fragrances where it smells more like it belongs in a department store than others.

Match made in heaven - worth every amount of hype it gets. Its ice cream balanced by a slight floral/matcha note. It's SO good and my #1 by sorce. Genuinely not a better smelling creamy sweet matcha scent out there.

Snow moon magic - had to buy this one bc of the hype. It smelled like burnt cookies to me, I really don't see how people are wearing this heavy of a fragrance all of the time!? If you dont like a syrupy cookie smell, I wouldn't blind buy. I ended up selling.

Strings of light in the forest - Lavender with a hinntttt of vanilla. But mainly just lavender. If you like lavender, you'd like this but its just straight up lavender lol.

Love & Complications - TARTE but so so good. This reminds me of going to the beach with a juicy perfume on and some sunscreen!? The passionfruit is front and center but it dries with this really pretty depth. Perfect summer scent and definitely my favorite fruit accord that I've smelled.

Falling stars Marshmallow cloud - Similar to snow moon magic, it smelled very syrupy burnt cookie-like to me but you can definitely pick up the coffee in this as well. I was hoping the marshmallow would lighten this up but it wasn't really prominent.

Fairy Queens Revenge - I really didn't like this one, this smelled the most ""perfumey"" to me out of any of their scents but not in a good way. Came off very dusty, perfumey and almost sickeningly floral. Its definitely supposed to be like a classic ""perfume"" scent but it just wasn't a hit for my nose.

Reduced to a thing that wants you - I thought I was going to love this bc everyone was describing this as a skin scent... it was not. This was similar to FQR in a way that it has that sickeningly floral aspect but there was also something in there that smelled like a fruit had been sitting getting musty.",1,1769271101.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

1qlqyy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/comments/1qlqyy0/shakedown_the_last_2_lbs/,Shakedown -- the last 2 lbs,"By popular demand, I am posting my current \~12 lb tarp and bivy loadout for review. I'm looking for ways to get it down to 10 lbs with minimal cost and impact. Please treat this as a fun, light-hearted shakedown discussion.

Givens:

Conditions are summer in the US Northeast at low to moderate elevations, such as the Green Mountains, Adirondacks, etc. Rain is definitely likely. Nighttime temps may be 50F or a bit less. Bugs are a major issue, including black flies, mosquitos, and ticks carrying Lyme disease.  Wet clothes, either from sweat or immersion, may not dry before going to bed.

Hard canisters are not required, but bears are definitely common and active in the area. I'm not going to hang food, because it's a hassle, appropriate tree geometry is not always available, and it is less effective.

This loadout assumes short trips of 1-2 nights; beyond that I would need to add my 10k battery and possibly more fuel.

My actual, real-world plan is to save up for a Fast Kumo 36 (about $190, 20.7 oz), which would be used for fastpacking and overnight ultralight trips, and Alpha Direct top and bottom (about $190, about 9 oz), which would replace *both* the sleeping clothes and the quarter-zip fleece top.  I know that cheaper packs like the Virga exist, but prefer to save up a bit more for one better suited to fastpacking. Of course, for discussion purposes you can suggest whatever you want!

It's trivial to get this below 10 lbs if you can spend a few hundred dollars. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to show how to reduce the base weight to no more than 10 lbs *at minimal cost*. Can you do it for $50? $100? $150?

It's a requirement to be able to sleep either in stealth sites (easy, soft hummus or pine needles), designated sites (usually rock hard), or in lean-to shelters (hard wood). I am approaching retirement age and have trouble sleeping even at home, so a thin pad is not sufficient at the latter two types sites. I have tried a wide range of pads over the years and the XLite is by far the best tradeoff I have found between weight and ""sleepability.""

Reducing comfort during the day is acceptable, reduced *sleeping* comfort is not because it would mean not getting a good night's sleep.

Cold food (not cold soak, but bars, chocolate, jerky, etc.) is an option. I would really miss coffee in the morning, though!

Note carefully that some items in the lighterpack are ""quantity zero (0)."" This is to show some no-cost options that I already have.

Have fun!

I sit quietly, my tears falling, feeling the weight of a history that often goes unacknowledged. At 10, I found my voice in a world that silenced me, telling my mother about the man who molested me. But instead of comfort, I was met with disbelief and sent away, alone on a bus, filled with confusion and fear.

By 11, I faced a horror that no child should endure. An acquaintance, armed with a knife, seized my innocence. In that moment of terror, I played along, hoping to survive. But when I saw a chance, I fought back, stabbing him in a blur of adrenaline. The next thing I remember is collapsing in front of a car, the world around me a chaotic scene of blood and screams. The Army Housing Community gathered, eyes wide in shock. My mother wept, and my father, coldly judging, remarked on my ruffled miniskirt. I was just a child—how could he not see me?

These experiences set off a cascade of trauma that no child should have to navigate. Growing up in a cycle of abuse, I witnessed not just my pain but that of my mother and grandmother—sexual assault, infidelity, and violence, creating a twisted legacy. At 14, another soldier violated me; at 17, an ex-Army Ranger beat me, leaving me to believe I deserved it. I was trapped in a cycle of shame, desperate for love yet constantly betrayed.

Yet, through it all, I held onto my faith, instilled by my aunt and great-grandmother. Jesus was my lifeline, a flicker of hope amidst the darkness. I learned to pull myself up, even as a child, and by 15, I was emancipated—a label that implied I could care for myself. But the truth was far murkier.

I became a mother four times, facing the heartbreak of miscarriages and the toll of trauma manifesting in chronic illnesses. Double hip implants and numerous surgeries became my reality, yet I persevered. Alone and disabled, I navigated a world that often felt indifferent to my struggles. I have no family to lean on, having been cast out for speaking the truth about abuse. Even my cousins, victims themselves, chose silence over support, leaving me to bear the burden of our shared pain.

Now, at 55, I find myself battling not just the memories of my past but the harsh realities of life. I work from home for a large healthcare company, striving for benefits while navigating the labyrinth of social services. Medicaid feels like a cruel joke, and I’m constantly pushed aside, my voice lost in a sea of bureaucracy. Despite my income exceeding requirements, my 560 credit score haunts me. I’ve never been evicted; I’ve always paid my rent, yet I’m overshadowed by others who don’t carry the weight of this history.

Recently, I moved into a run-down trailer, sacrificing comfort for financial security. I once raised my children in beautiful neighborhoods, yet all I seek now is a view, a block fence, and peace. I still need help with deposits—if you feel moved, you can find me at @Fayerae1220 on Venmo. I’ve always paid it forward, and I still believe in the goodness of people, despite the darkness I’ve faced.

I will have all the funds to move on Feb 6. I don’t know how find movers. They seem too expensive but we can’t do it. Aging services can’t help. 211 told me on the down low that theres “no help out there, try churches”…. did that, bit thats their parishioners tithes. Thats completely understandable. 

Our kids lives have become too busy recently, to help. 

Even as we navigate this, I hold onto hope. My partner, my children’s father, is in the hospital again, adding to the temporary issues. We need to move, but affordable help is elusive. My dreams of owning an RV or camper linger on the horizon—a symbol of freedom, a sanctuary no one can take from me. I long for the simple pleasure of drinking coffee and marveling at the beauty of God’s creation.

I share my story not for pity but for understanding. Currently i live in a neighborhood so unsafe i cant walk outside even in the daytime. I was scolded at work for the noises outside. Its awful.

 

We are out here, unseen and unheard. For every person struggling, for every story buried beneath pain, I implore you to look beyond the surface. As I navigate this journey, I hold tight to my faith, believing that one day, my story will resonate and inspire change. 

We are here. We are real. And we deserve to be seen.

1qlqxnw,https://i.redd.it/5uk6lp30nbfg1.jpeg,Tips for dialing in Prodigal Washed Caturra? Missing acidity & clarity,"Hey r/pourover,

I’m currently brewing Prodigal – Washed Caturra and could use some tips from people who’ve worked with this coffee.

Current setup:

	•	Recipe: Lance Hedrick–style (1:15, \~45g bloom, single final pour, very low agitation)

	•	Brewer: V60

	•	Filter: Cafec Abaca+

	•	Grinder: DF54 (true zero at 0, currently grinding at \~75)

	•	Water temp: 93 °C

	•	Water: Self-mineralized (Aramse recipe)

The cups are clean and balanced, but I’m missing some acidity and vibrancy. The listed flavor notes like pomegranate and orange aren’t really popping — they feel a bit muted and blended.

Has anyone brewed this coffee and found a sweet spot?

Would you push grind finer/coarser, tweak the ratio, add agitation, or change temp?

It felt like a chore, but then I stumbled on an old, funny photo thread with a friend I haven't spoken to in years. It made me laugh out loud and completely turned my mood around. It was such a small thing, but it felt like a little gift from past me.

It got me thinking: we often focus on the big stuff, but it's these tiny, unexpected bright spots that can really make a day.

So, I'm curious: **what's one small, good thing—big or tiny—that happened to you in the last few days?** A nice interaction, finding something you lost, a good cup of coffee, anything!

It’s every Thursday at the oaks parking lot across from pedals and pints. I wasn’t expecting much but that was an unfair assumption. holy heck the oranges from Ken’s are awesome. a bit pricey but dang they’re good. He usually has free samples out so go try them. Then the 5 dollar wine tasting is cool. I love that lady’s Grenache. And I love the fresh coffee beans from Cafe con Javi. Then there’s a German sausage guy that I bought from last week. Just yum. I’ve gone for the last three weeks and have bought stuff mostly at first just because I love supporting local and small business but honestly the stuff is really good! AND I actually made a couple of new friends while there by just striking up conversations. It’s a really nice vibe! Anyway, you should check it out. And if you see me come say hi.

It's a weirdly lonely club we're in, right? I've been trying to lean into the patient side of things, but I'll admit I still get hit with that wave of envy when I see couples out in the wild who actually look like they enjoy each other. Lately, I'm just trying to focus on the long-game and not let my self-worth be tied to someone else's ""headache"" or ""long day."" If I don't laugh at the absurdity of it all, I'd probably just be a grump, and lets be honest... nobody wants to be around a grump, even in a dead bedroom.

I'm curious for those of you still in the trenches but trying to stay positive: what is one small win you've had for yourself lately that has nothing to do with your spouse? Maybe you finally hit a new goal at the gym, finished a project, or just found a new local spot with actually decent coffee.

I went from my heart rate being between 40-60bpm in my sleep, to mostly above 60 bpm. My respiratory rate during sleep is normal, so probably not sleep apnea. 

What might cause that? Would quitting weed and not taking my prescribed adderall cause that? Ive quit weed, caffeine, and stopped taking adderall per doctors orders while Ive been getting testing to rule out causes for a fainting episode I had on Dec 21st. Before then I used weed occasionally (1-4 days per week only in the evening), I took prescribed adderall 3-5 days per week, and drank coffee 3-5 days per week. I figured my average heart rate would go down after quitting all these things, but the opposite has happened and it seems weird to me. 

Since the end of Dec. Ive had an an ekg, echo, holter, and next week will have a stress test. So far results of testing have been normal except for mild mitral valve regurgitation and mild PACs on EKG (2,100 in 6 days, so not a high burden).

1qlqkrt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qlqkrt,Name a prettier face card than Marin Kitagawa .. Il Wait,"I wandered through the quiet streets, noticing how the morning light hit the rooftops just right. Some birds hopped along the sidewalk, pecking at crumbs as they moved. A gentle breeze rustled through the trees, carrying the scent of flowers. You could hear faint voices from a café down the block. And then a cyclist passed, ringing his bell softly as he went by. Moments later, the smell of fresh bread drifted from a bakery. A small paper fluttered across the pavement, carried by the wind. Moss grew stubbornly on the side of the old brick wall. A shopkeeper waved at a passerby, smiling. Distant traffic rumbled softly in the background. Even the pigeons seemed to pause, watching the world unfold. The air smelled faintly of damp earth and flowers. Here and there, people paused to tie shoelaces or check their phones. Every footstep echoed softly, oddly amplified by the stillness. Fog hung low near the river, diffusing the sunlight. Insects buzzed lazily around a patch of wildflowers. Nothing else stirred except the occasional flutter of leaves. A lone bicycle leaned against a lamppost, its tires dusty. Light reflected off puddles from last night’s rain. Soft laughter came from a small group entering the park. Every sound mingled into a gentle rhythm. A cat darted under a bench, disappearing quickly. Some leaves drifted down slowly in the breeze. Only a few cars rolled past, far away. Night hadn’t yet arrived, but shadows stretched long. On the horizon, a thin cloud streaked the sky. Faint music spilled from an open window nearby. A child’s giggle echoed faintly as they ran across the square. Overhead, a plane left a pale contrail behind. The scent of brewing coffee filled the air. The afternoon sunlight glinted off the rooftops, soft and warm. Observing the world around me, I felt strangely calm. Breathing deeply, I stepped forward. Unnoticed, a small bird hopped along the path. Rainbows of light glimmered faintly through the clouds. Yonder, a lone bench waited beneath a tree. Hawks circled high above, indifferent. In the distance, a train rumbled faintly. Sparrows flitted between branches, calling softly. Second thoughts crossed my mind, then vanished. Every shadow lengthened in the afternoon sun. Children’s laughter drifted from the playground. On benches, people sipped drinks quietly. Nearby, the fountain trickled rhythmically. Dogs barked once or twice before settling down. Mossy stones lined the walkway, slick from dew. Crows cawed somewhere up high. Muffled music echoed faintly from a street musician. I paused to watch a paper boat float in a puddle. Kites danced lazily in the wind above the park. A cloud passed slowly, softening the light. Squirrels leapt nimbly between branches. A cat sniffed a corner of a wall, uninterested. All around, the city hummed softly. Cicadas buzzed faintly, hidden in the greenery. Kaleidoscopic reflections shimmered in the windows. Every movement blended into the gentle rhythm. Rain never came. Moments of calm lingered, filling the street. All was quiet. Nothing unusual happened. ",0,1769270186.0,animequestions,9,0.38,False

There’s something almost poetic about the sound of crayons scratching across paper.  
No notifications. No background noise. Just pure focus and a child lost in imagination.

I still remember watching my niece color her first page completely out of the lines — and the proud little grin when she lifted it up like it was a masterpiece.  
That’s when it clicked for me: coloring isn’t just a pastime, it’s one of the first ways kids learn to express things they can’t always *say*.

In a world overflowing with screens, we forget how powerful simplicity can be.  
That’s exactly why I decided to create a **kids coloring ebook** — made to help little ones slow down, explore their creativity, and for parents… maybe steal a few quiet minutes with a warm cup of coffee.

If you’re curious, here’s something you can use today whether or not you download anything:

* 🖍 Coloring can help kids self-regulate emotions and improve focus  
* ✨ Simple designs build confidence (no “perfect art” pressure needed)  
* 🎭 Creative time boosts mindfulness and lowers stress for both parent *and* child

After hearing from teachers and parents who tried this, one unspoken truth kept surfacing — **coloring isn’t just for fun. It’s therapy disguised as play.**

So, I wanted to make this accessible for more families.  
You can **download the free kids coloring ebook here:**  
👉 [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

It’s packed with lighthearted characters, positive scenes, and easy flow pages designed especially for small hands. Perfect for preschoolers, early learners, and kids who just love to color — mess and all.  

And because joy is best when shared, we’re doing a massive **coloring giveaway** to spread the creative spark!  
Get your free access here 👉 [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

Every child deserves a space to create, to dream, to *just be a kid*.  
Even a small act — sharing a free resource, gifting some crayons — makes a lasting mark in a child’s world.

So if you know a parent, teacher, or caregiver who could use a moment of calm and color, share this link:

1qlqh2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1qlqh2j/open_muse_cabin_meeting_winter_2041_season/,(Open) Muse Cabin Meeting: Winter 2041 Season,"Yohan was nervous. He was freshly made the counselor of the Muse cabin and he was so nervous he was going to fail spectacularly. So, to settle his nerves he started preparing because work generally got him through his problems. So, he set up some signs pointing towards the basement theater saying:

\> Muse Cabin Meeting This Way

He then set up some tables in the back of the theater with various snacks for everyone to enjoy. He also put out some water, tea, coffee, soda (in case a certain son of Poseidon showed up), and various juices. After the initial setup was done he started pacing inside the theater until people started to arrive. As usual the first bit of the meeting would be just for Muse campers, but the second half would be an open house for the camp.

Finally after the majority of Muse campers showed up Yohan nodded at them giving a half smile. He stood at the front of the chairs and looked out at everyone.

“Hey guys, so in case you didn’t know I’m the new Muse counselor.” He said his smile widening a small bit before he got a little more serious. “I know we’re still dealing with Dorian’s… passing.”

Yohan paused for a moment to let that sit amongst the assembled Muse campers. “But uh… we will never forget him and I know we will all carry him with us as we continue forward.” Yohan said as he took a somber tone.

“So, onto other business.” He said, pursing his lips. It’s not exactly easy to switch topics after something so serious. “Last season we got second place as a cabin, so congrats to everyone’s hard work. With that we can either cash in a cabin renovation, or go on a trip as a cabin. I’ll let you all decide what \[we choose\]([https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdS6Ky-F2vahGF3MUsw7xnyPXDBPFHwONgCkHVZ6eO\_FvQ8Lg/viewform?usp=header).”](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdS6Ky-F2vahGF3MUsw7xnyPXDBPFHwONgCkHVZ6eO_FvQ8Lg/viewform?usp=header).%E2%80%9D)

“Okay, next up is alliances for this season. Does anyone have any cabin they want to try and form an alliance with?” Yohan asked as he looked out at the assorted demigods. After waiting for a bit he decided to move on.

“Finally, just wanted to say that I’m very excited to be your counselor. Feel free to talk to me whenever you need something or might need someone to talk to. I’m always open and available. You all know where my room is, and if I’m not there I’m usually in the gym, practice room thingy.” Yohan said, looking out at his cousins. He gave them a smile and took a breath.

“Alright, I’m about to let everyone else in. Go block off the areas you don’t want people exploring before it’s too late.” He said before nodding to everyone to adjourn the meeting portion of the cabin meeting.

With that the doors to the Muse cabin would be opened and all the curious campers could come explore the \*open\* areas of the Muse cabin. Yohan would be milling around checking on people as the event proceeded. Every now and then he’d grab a fresh tray of snacks making sure their guests were having a good time.

Also seen around the cabin giving head butts and begging for treats, Marie the cat could be seen. Yohan and the rest of the Muse cabin have been taking care of her since Dorian’s death.",2,1769269956.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,1.0,False

1qlqg66,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_DecentData5441/comments/1qlqg66/the_science_project_had_to_be_finished_before_the/,The Science Project Had to Be Finished Before the Engineer Got Home,"On Thursday afternoon I was sitting in the school pickup line when Abby came bursting through the door.

“Mom, I have a project I need to do before wrestling practice.”

My eyes narrowed in the rearview mirror.
“What kind of project?”

With fear in her voice, she said, “A science project.”

The violins of a horror soundtrack could have been ominously playing in the background.

Everyone in that car understood what this meant.

Well… almost everyone. Ashley, oblivious to the danger, kicked her feet and drooled happily that her sissa and bobba were next to her. But even TJ, the family’s resident chaos agent, actually reached over and put a hand on Abby’s shoulder.

“Good luck, Abby.”

This project had to be completed before the engineer got home.

Now before I start complaining, I need to say this: we are unbelievably blessed to have a husband and father who takes such an interest in his kids’ schoolwork. In fact, our entire family exists because he was something of a math-tutoring prodigy in seventh grade. Abby and TJ are both good at math, so more often than not, its me he's having to help. 

And after twenty years of patience, I think his may finally be running thin. For example, no matter how many times he explains that “a 20% tip is just the bill multiplied by ten and doubled,” I still don’t get it. Is it divided by ten then doubled? He’s going to kill me when he reads this.

But science is a whole other problem.

Bubs lives and breathes discovery. A simple elementary school task is never just a task. It is an opportunity. A gateway. A chance to optimize. And while this is a wonderful quality in a man who's trusted to land aircraft and design systems, it is deeply threatening when the job at hand is fourth-grade homework.

Abby’s assignment was simple enough: a short report on the creosote bush — the scraggly, indestructible plant that covers southern Arizona like it’s been personally appointed by God to survive the apocalypse. One question asked about the “thickness” of the bush.

Normal people hear this and think, measure how wide it is.

Engineers hear this and think, define your variables.

I could feel the clock ticking. Wrestling practice. Dinner. Bedtime. And looming over all of it: the moment the garage door would open.

So we moved fast.

We defined “thickness” as “how wide the bush is.”
We walked down the street with the dogs to a patch of creosote bushes.
Abby measured.
Abby wrote a few complete sentences.
We did not Google peer-reviewed desert ecology studies.

The work was completed. The worksheet was tucked neatly in a backpack. The child was intact. The house was quiet.

For a brief moment, I believed we were safe.

Cue the horror music.

The next morning I was packing lunches and singing Ophelia to Ashley while she cooed in her swing when I saw Bubs come through the front door from his run — and Abby’s red folder sitting innocently on the coffee table. She must have pulled it out of her backpack sometime during the night.

It was a race. I lost.

With no ill intent, Bubs picked up the folder, probably trying to figure out where it belonged. Then came the pacing. The flipping of pages. Rubbing his temples. His eyes searching for some hidden instruction only he might detect. It’s adorable — and something he’s done since middle school, when he’d have to step into the hallway to “pace and think” so he wouldn’t disturb the class.

And then — predictably, lovingly, catastrophically — he said:

“Aww Abby, I wish you would have let me help you. We could have googled the density of creosote bushes in the area, then walked to the Arizona Trail and created a representative sample of land. We could have measured all the bushes in that area and gotten a much more accurate answer.”

Abby looked at me, clearly relieved — but I caught a flicker of guilt in her blue eyes.
“Sorry Dad, maybe next time. I just needed to get it done before wrestling practice.” She padded into the kitchen.

I giggled. I couldn’t help it.

“Sorry you didn’t get to make a spreadsheet on creosote bushes.”

(Yes, I know. I shouldn’t have.)

He sighed, wounded but determined.

“Dani, fine, I get that you’re teasing me. But need I remind you she wants to go to the Air Force Academy? The kids she’ll be competing with are already doing things like this.”

I looked at him — this tall, handsome man I love more than life itself — and said calmly:

“I love you, Bubs, but no they aren’t.”

I shouldn’t have said that either, but as a former elementary school teacher and assistant principal, I get to play the expert sometimes.

Here’s the thing that’s so strange about marriage.

We have combined DNA to make entirely new people. Our finances are so entangled it would take a team of highly paid accountants to untangle them. We know each other’s worst habits, deepest insecurities, and the exact tone of voice that means this is not worth pursuing further.

And still — still — we can find ourselves locked in a quiet power struggle over a fourth-grade science worksheet.

He left for his shower with a dismissive, “You really can be a jerk sometimes, Dani.”

And I stood there, loving him completely… while internally gloating just a little.

But as the morning wore on, I started to feel guilty. Yes, I’d landed a crushing victory with my smart-ass lines, but is he really the person I want to score victories against?

Sometimes yes. But maybe not on Friday, January 23rd. 

So Ashley and I drove into town and kidnapped him for lunch at Texas Roadhouse — mostly paleo-ish for him (which means extra rolls for me) while I listened to him talk about his day and marveled, once again, that there are people as smart as him keeping the world running.

And honestly?

I survived.
Abby survived.
The creosote bush survived.

Bubs knows there'll be plenty more science projects  in the future, some of which will require spreadsheets and analysis. 


And thankfully Texas Roadhouse has a little computer that figures out the tip for you.",2,1769269899.0,u_DecentData5441,1,1.0,False
1qlqftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1qlqftm/parking_tips_for_nils_at_humphreys_backstage_live/,parking tips for nils at humphreys backstage live (san diego 01/25),"  
  
hey everyone, figured i'd share a quick parking rundown for the nils show on 01/25. parking on shelter island for a 6:00 pm start is always a whole thing, especially when the dinner crowd is hitting the area hard. it’s best to go in with a plan or you'll be circling forever.  
  
if you want the absolute easiest parking and don't mind paying a little extra, check out Prked first. it's an app that lets people rent out their driveways and garages, sometimes right next to humphreys half moon inn. honestly, it can be way cheaper than the venue's lot and you skip the worst of the shelter island drive traffic by getting onto a side street. it’s the insider trick to a short walk.  
  
for the closest official spot, you can use the humphreys half moon inn lot itself. it’s right between the hotel and the restaurant, super convenient, but they charge $25 for event parking. that's the price for being right next to the door.  
  
the main free spots are your best bet if you get there early, and i mean early, like 5:00 pm or before. the port of san diego has tons of free public parking spaces along shelter island drive. look for the big public parking lots at the shelter island boat launch ramp or shoreline park. they are totally free, but they fill up crazy fast.  
  
a huge warning: you must absolutely make sure you do not park in any yellow-marked boat trailer spots in those lots, those are strictly for trailers only and you will get a ticket. also, keep in mind that the port parks close at 10:30 pm, so don't linger too long if you park in a lot like shoreline park.  
  
there are also some metered spots and pay stations along shelter island, like near portside coffee across the street. the meter enforcement on shelter island typically ends at 6 p.m.. since the show starts right at 6:00 pm, if you arrive around 5:00 pm, you'd only need to pay for one hour of parking, which is a sweet deal compared to the $25 lot. but read the posted sign super carefully to double-check the time limits before you feed a meter.  
  
pro tip for getting out: shelter island drive can back up a lot at the end of the night with everyone trying to get off the island. if you want a fast escape, park further down the island, closer to the rosecrans street exit, and walk the extra distance to humphreys. it saves a ton of time not being in the queue for the roundabout. hope this helps you enjoy nils without the parking stress!",1,1769269877.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

And it wasn't like it was over several weeks. He tried to hit on me from day 1, and it's day 3 now. He came in looking mad and being cold with me today because I wouldn't accept his offer for coffee. He also brought food for me, and I turned it down because 1, I had already eaten, and 2, he didn't even ask if I wanted it. I wouldve let him know not to buy me anything if he'd ask in the first place. Now I feel like he's angry at me that he spent money on something I didn't want. If the circumstance was different, I would've been grateful and willing to accept it because I appreciate people wanting to connect, but he was grabbing my shoulders on day 1 and asking about my relationship situation, saying he used to date asian women and love Asian food (I'm Asian), so I didn't feel comfortable accepting anything from him because I felt it would lead him on. He also sends me rose emojis through text and trying to start conversation with me unrelated to the work he's doing, but I keep it short and professional and have been hiding in my room after the first day. I feel like maybe it's somewhat my fault for not being direct and asking him to stop, but I don't feel comfortable downright rejecting a guy for my own safety. I figured politely turning down all his offers and keeping it professional would be a hint that I'm not interested. It just makes me angry that people get mad when I don't like them back. They'll tell me I led them on for accepting offers to hang out or get lunch etc., even though I would pay for my own food. In my mind, they want to just hang out and make friends, so I don't realize they like me until it becomes very obvious. I'm just angry that they put the responsibility on me for their emotions, but they're the ones that put me in this position, and I'm not obligated to have feelings for you or go out on dates.

The highest I had seen (when I was really having anxiety about it) was 165/110. I’m now averaging 111/66 with a pulse rate of 58. 

Over the last several years this bp issue has caused me a lot of anxiety. I’ve been on 3 different meds - lisinopril, HCTZ and Metroprolol is the one I just quit. All of them had issues keeping it low. Even on meds I was seeing 138-145/upper 90’s. 

I periodically quit coffee for a few days to see if it helped and it did a little, but I’ve never quit for this long (I’m at 30 days now). 

Cardiologist and docs have never asked about lifestyle (I’m relatively fit for a 54 year old) and diet. The studies I’ve read all champion caffeine and claim that your body adjusts to your intake over time so it doesn’t raise bp in the long term. 

So I’ve gone from 1/2 - 1 cup per day to absolute zero Caffeine.  I’ve replaced my morning cup of coffee with a giant glass of water and have starting eating a little more protein focuses which minimizes blood sugar spikes. Also, the anxiety around bp is fading fast now that I know it’s primarily a problem caused by stimulants. All of these have added up to major positive changes.

Good luck on your BP journies. If you’re using any kind of caffeine try to go off of it for 30 days and see if it helps.",3,1769269699.0,bloodpressure,5,1.0,False

1qlqa7v,https://i.redd.it/cobmad6mibfg1.jpeg,The Gravity of Secrets: Bob Lazar's Journey Through the Looking Glass,"

The desert heat was already oppressive that June morning in 1982 when Bob Lazar pulled into the Los Alamos National Laboratory parking lot, the distinctive whine of his jet-powered Honda CRX trailing behind him like a sonic signature. The car, a testament to Bob's peculiar genius and irreverent approach to problem-solving, could hit 200 miles per hour—though he rarely pushed it past 150 on his morning commute. ""No point in spilling your coffee at Mach 0.2,"" he'd joke to anyone who'd listen.

Inside the lab's auditorium, Dr. Edward Teller, the legendary father of the hydrogen bomb, was scheduled to speak about the nuclear freeze movement. Bob arrived early, as was his habit when interesting physics was involved. He found Teller outside, leaning against a brick wall, absorbed in the morning edition of the Los Alamos Monitor. The front page featured a story about a local physicist who'd built a jet car—Bob himself, grinning beside his creation in the photograph. ""So you're the madman with the jet car,"" Teller said without looking up, his thick Hungarian accent making the words sound almost musical. Bob introduced himself, and they talked briefly about propulsion systems and the elegance of thrust-to-weight ratios. It was a conversation that would change the trajectory of Bob's life in ways that defied even his imagination.

Six years later, in late 1988, Bob received a phone call that seemed to materialize from the ether of that chance encounter. EG&G, a defense contractor, wanted to interview him for a position. The caller mentioned Dr. Teller's recommendation, and suddenly Bob found himself in an office that felt more like a set from a spy film than a job interview. The questions were bizarre—less about his qualifications and more about his loyalty, his ability to keep secrets, and oddly enough, his thoughts on extraterrestrial life. ""Do you believe in the existence of life beyond Earth?"" the interviewer asked, his face expressionless behind wire-rimmed glasses. Bob's answer was characteristically measured with a hint of his dry humor: ""Statistically speaking, it would be arrogant to assume we're the only ones who figured out how to split atoms and make bad television."" The job offer came wrapped in more secrecy than a classified weapons program. Bob would be working at a facility called S4, approximately 15 miles south of the infamous Area 51, near Papoose Lake. His commute would involve flying from McCarran Airport to Groom Lake, then a bus ride with blacked-out windows to the facility itself—a journey that felt like descending through layers of increasing unreality.

S4 wasn't what Bob expected. Built into the side of a mountain and camouflaged to blend with the desert terrain, the facility consisted of nine hangar bays, each containing something that would fundamentally challenge his understanding of physics and humanity's place in the universe. On his first day, walking through the hangar doors instead of the usual entrance, Bob saw it: a disc-shaped craft, roughly 35 feet in diameter, sitting on the hangar floor with a small American flag affixed to its hull. ""Finally,"" Bob thought, allowing himself a moment of amusement, ""all those UFO nuts were just seeing classified military projects."" He reached out to touch the craft's surface, which appeared seamless, as if the entire structure had been formed from a single piece of material. A guard immediately barked at him to keep his hands to himself and his eyes forward.

In the briefing room, Bob was left alone with approximately 120 blue folders containing information that read like science fiction—except it was stamped with classification levels he'd never seen before. The documents described not one but nine recovered craft of apparent non-terrestrial origin, along with propulsion systems that operated on principles that made his jet car look like a stone wheel. The reports were matter-of-fact, written in the dry technical language of government documentation, which somehow made their content even more surreal. Bob's lab partner, Barry, turned out to be a godsend—a chattier scientist who'd been working on the project long enough to have developed a healthy sense of gallows humor about the whole situation. Barry was particularly eager to have a new partner, having spent months talking mostly to himself and the alien technology. ""Welcome to the island of misfit physicists,"" Barry said on Bob's first day in their shared lab. ""Where we reverse-engineer things that technically shouldn't exist according to every textbook you've ever read.""

The craft Bob was assigned to work on—which he nicknamed the ""Sport Model"" for its sleek, classic flying saucer appearance—operated on principles that violated everything he thought he knew about physics. At its heart was a reactor that used an element not found on Earth's periodic table: Element 115. This superheavy element, when bombarded with protons, would transmute to Element 116 and release antimatter in the process. The antimatter reaction would then produce a gravitational wave that could be amplified and directed.

Imagine gravity not as a force but as a distortion in space-time, like a bowling ball creating a depression in a stretched rubber sheet. The craft's reactor created its own bowling ball, so to speak, but one that could be moved and manipulated. By creating this artificial gravitational field, the craft could essentially fall in any direction it chose, achieving propulsion without traditional thrust. It was like surfing on waves of warped space-time.

The interior of the Sport Model was as alien as its propulsion system. No right angles, no visible seams or joints, no conventional controls—just smooth, flowing surfaces that seemed to have been grown rather than manufactured. The chairswere too small for average-height humans, clearly designed for occupants of more diminutive stature. Bob often joked that whoever built these things had never heard of a Big Mac—a quip that earned him a stern look from his supervisor but a chuckle from Barry.
The reactor itself was surprisingly small, about the size of a basketball, and produced a gravitational field that extended beyond the craft in a way that could be focused through three gravity amplifiers positioned on the craft's underside. These amplifiers worked in concert, allowing the craft to balance on gravitational waves like a tripod. In ""omicron configuration,"" all three amplifiers focused on a single point, allowing for interstellar travel by literally pulling the destination toward the craft rather than traveling through space conventionally.

Bob's natural humor helped him cope with the mind-bending nature of his work. He gave nicknames to all nine craft he eventually glimpsed during his time at S4: the ""Top Hat"" (shaped like its namesake), the ""Jello Mold"" (which wobbled slightly even when stationary), and others. When Barry asked him how he maintained such levity given the earth-shattering implications of their work, Bob replied, ""Look, either I laugh about working on alien hot rods, or I check myself into a psychiatric facility. The commute here is shorter.""

The element 115 fuel was perhaps the most fascinating aspect. Unlike terrestrial elements, this material was stable—a fact that flew in the face of nuclear physics as Bob understood it. The briefing materials suggested it came from a solar system with much larger stars than our sun, where the increased particle flux during stellar formationallowed for the creation of superheavy stable elements. Earth's scientists wouldn't successfully synthesize Element 115 (Moscovium) until 2003, and even then, it decayed in milliseconds—nothing like the stable isotope Bob handled at S4. Working at S4 meant living under a microscope. Bob's phone was tapped, his movements monitored, and his personal life scrutinized with an intensity that would make the NSA jealous. It was through this surveillance that his employers discovered his wife was having an affair—a fact they knew before Bob did. The facility's security apparatus decided that an emotionally compromised physicist working on recovered alien technology was a liability, and Bob found his access increasingly restricted without explanation.

Frustrated and paranoid—a reasonable response when you're working on extraterrestrial technology for a government that won't acknowledge the existence of the base you're working at—Bob made a decision that would ultimately end his career at S4. He began telling close friends about his work, viewing it as insurance against simply disappearing one day. His friend John Lear, a pilot and UFO enthusiast, was particularly interested. Gene Huff, another friend, thought Bob had lost his mind until Bob offered to prove it. Knowing the test flight schedule, Bob led small groups of friends out to the desert on Wednesday nights when he knew the craft would be tested. They would park near Highway 375 with a clear view of the Papoose Lake area and wait. Bob's knowledge proved accurate—they witnessed objects performing maneuvers that defied conventional aviation: instantaneous acceleration, right-angle turns at high speed, and the ability to hover silently. ""See that?"" Bob would say with understated satisfaction as a glowing disc performed impossible maneuvers in the distance. ""Your tax dollars at work.""

The third time Bob brought his friends out to watch the tests, they were stopped by security on their way back. The Lincoln County sheriff's department, clearly acting on behalf of the base, detained them and took their information. Bob knew his time at S4 was over before he even made it home that night. The Winnebago they'd taken out to the desert—packed with friends eager to glimpse the impossible—had become the vehicle that ended his journey through the looking glass. The next day, Bob was summoned not to work but to a debriefing that felt more like an interrogation. They knew about the desert excursions, about his breach of security, about everything. His employment was terminated immediately, and the threats—both subtle and explicit—began almost immediately. His academic records seemed to evaporate, his employment history at Los Alamos suddenly became murky, and Bob found himself transformed from a physicist with top-secret clearance into a non-person.But Bob Lazar had never been one to go quietly into the night. If they were going to erase him, he reasoned with characteristic defiance, he might as well ensure everyone knew why. His decision to go public with investigative journalist George Knapp in 1989 would transform Area 51 from a classified testing ground known only to aviation enthusiasts into a cultural phenomenon, spawning countless theories, movies, and midnight pilgrimages to the Nevada desert.

Looking back, Bob often reflected on the irony of it all. He'd spent years attaching jet engines to bicycles and cars, pushing the boundaries of conventional propulsion for the sheer joy of going fast. Then he'd been handed the keys to understanding propulsion systems that made his jet car look like a horse and buggy—technology that could manipulate the fundamental forces of the universe itself. And he'd lost it all because he couldn't resist sharing the cosmic joke with his friends on a warm Nevada night. The universe,"" Bob would later say with his characteristic dry humor, ""has a hell of a sense of timing. Give a guy who builds jet cars access to gravity wave propulsion, then fire him for taking his buddies on a desert field trip to watch the merchandise. If aliens ever read my story, they're probably laughing their grey asses off.""

The craft still fly over Nevada, witnesses still report impossible maneuvers in the night sky, and somewhere in the desert, nine hangars carved into a mountainside hold secrets that challenge our understanding of physics, our place in the universe, and the very nature of reality itself. Bob Lazar lit the fuse on one of the greatest stories of the twentieth century—appropriately enough for a man who spent his life making things go very, very fast—and then watched it explode across the public consciousness like one of his beloved jet engines, impossible to ignore and impossible to stop.",1,1769269508.0,u_Comprehensive-End697,0,1.0,False

I would prefer to bring along my existing low-profile mechanical keyboard, a Keychron K7, which I’ve often used with my iPad as a quasi-deck. So I’ve looked at the BYOK, and I’m still considering it. But I’ve read some mixed comments about its build quality, display quality, current software capability, etc., that make me a little wary. (Also, it sounds like it may not be compatible with the K7 yet?)

The Supernote Nomad seems like it might also be a good choice—still small and portable, but with a better, bigger display, interesting pen-based editing capabilities when I want them, etc. But I am a little concerned about input lag; I’m a fast typist when I get going (around 100 wpm).

 History: I’m a 33 y.o. F with husband (36). We started TTC in 2024 and tried without assistance for nearly 1 year with 1 early MMC in September 2024. I had a D&C. We met with our fertility doctor in early 2025 and found that my husband has mild MFI (low morphology), I have slightly high AMH and possible PCO (not PCOS), and an SHG revealed mild scarring in my uterus (likely from D&C). I also have 1 or 2 fibroids but none of them are submucosal. At this point our doctor recommended having the scar tissue removed and trying IUI. We opted for IVF to give ourselves the best chances (I have also been an egg donor in the past so I was somewhat familiar with the process).

ER was in May 2025. We had 33 eggs retrieved, ultimately 5 embryos were PGT-A normal.

Then I had a hysteroscopy surgery to remove scar tissue in August with an MIG surgeon/Asherman’s specialist. She rechecked the cavity a few weeks post-op and there was no scar tissue.

First FET was 11/10/25. Used a 6BA PGT-A tested embryo. Fully medicated cycle with birth control for 3 weeks, then estradiol 2x/day, PIO every morning starting 5 days before FET, and baby aspirin. Lining was 11.36 prior to transfer and doctor said hormone levels were good. This transfer failed to implant. We were devastated but also knew that it can take a few tries.

Our second FET was on 1/12/26. The embryo was a 5BA tested embryo. This time we switched up the protocol slightly- still did BC for 3 weeks, baby aspirin, then estradiol 2x/day, but for progesterone I did endometrin suppositories in the AM and PM daily and PIO every 3 days because my body doesn’t seem to like PIO. I felt a little better with this protocol but still felt crappy on days we did PIO. Lining was 8.54 prior to transfer. My doctor had me do an extra PIO shot night of the transfer. We just got news that this one also failed to implant.

I did acupuncture 1-2 x/week for both transfers including the day before and day after transfers. I did vaginal probiotics before both. I also did intralipid infusions for both because my clinic offers them and why not?

I’m very healthy with no other known diagnoses, healthy BMI. I strength train regularly and do cardio like walking, hiking, running. I eat well, only organic, keep processed foods to a minimum. I’m super careful about using cleaning products and use very clean products for skincare, etc. My doctor puts everyone on Metformin so I’ve been taking that for months, but I also took prenatal, vitamin C, D, zinc, melatonin, fish oil, coq10, vit E, l-arganine, glutathione/NAC, magnesium prior to transfers and pared it down to just the basics after the transfers. I cut out alcohol for the 2 weeks prior and drink only half-caf coffee leading up, then decaf after.

I’m at a loss right now. I don’t know if it’s bad luck or what. We thought IVF would be the easy/safe route for us. What tests should I ask for at this point? Should I consider a 2^(nd) opinion? Are there any other lifestyle factors I can change? How can I get through this mentally? I’ve cried for days straight and feel dead inside.",2,1769269323.0,IVF,1,1.0,False

Di ko sure pano to pero try ko lang

I’m 33, male, and I’ve been single for almost 17 years na (yes, ganun katagal ). I’ve been working and living here in Cebu for about 2 years. Living alone here but I realized na okay naman maging independent and solo lang, pero iba pa rin talaga when you have someone to share life with  kahit kwentuhan lang while working or after work..

About me:
I'm 5 ' 2.
I really enjoy watching documentaries  mapa-history, crime, science, nature, or kahit random topics.
Movies and makinig ng mga relaxing songs.
Mahilig din akong mag-explore and travel, trying new places, food, and experiences. Pero to be honest, minsan may kulang pa rin when you’re always doing things alone, since wala akong kausap everytime i go to check this place.

I don't have a car only motorcycle, medyo shy type ako at first, especially sa mga bagong kakilala. Hindi rin po ako gwapo, just being honest pero I believe I’m kind, respectful, and a good listener. Once comfortable na, I can carry a conversation and I genuinely enjoy meaningful talks — life, dreams, random thoughts, kahit deep or light lang.

I have a decent and stable job here in Cebu, living a simple life lang.

What I’m looking for:
Someone na open lang muna sa conversation, no pressure and no expectations agad. Someone who’s also looking for connection, kahit slowly getting to know lang. If mag-click, maybe we can go on a coffee date (kahit di ako coffee lover, food lover oo), explore cebu city, or just chill and talk. Kung hanggang usap lang, okay din  let’s see where it goes.
I am very open din to make new friends here.

1qlpvfd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qlpvfd,What Thapar grads are up to after graduation,"Hey everyone,

Posting this here since it’s a Thapar community.

I’m a 2023 pass-out (Thapar) and one of the CXOs at a healthy snacking startup called The Drill. Our founding team is 3 people now (started as 4) — all software engineers from Thapar + NIT Jaipur.

Honestly, the whole “let’s build something” mindset started back on campus — late-night coding sessions, random startup ideas in hostels, and those endless conversations about placements vs startups.

We officially started The Drill in Feb 2025. Before that, in April 2024, we were building an AI assistant for mental health specialists. We worked hard on it, but eventually realised the long-term vision didn’t align well with India’s current medical infrastructure. Walking away from that was tough.

After months of research across industries, one gap stood out clearly: India didn’t really have a clean-label, purely natural protein bar. Most options were whey-heavy, overpriced for the protein they gave, or had ingredient lists longer than engineering textbooks.

So we jumped in.

What followed was chaos.

We ran 100s of trials ourselves—different protein sources, binders, formulations. Failed badly. Got stuck. Eventually hired a food technologist. Even then, the first samples weren’t good enough. More iterations. More waiting. More self-doubt.

(Attached images of our very first failed samples below)

Then came operations—the real monster.

Third-party manufacturing was too expensive at low volumes, so we decided to start our own tiny plant. Months went into scouting places, compliances, trademarks, packaging—everything from scratch.

I still remember 31st December 2024. We were grinding peanut butter in our tiny plant and wished each other a happy new year there. No party. Just machines, fatigue, and hope.

(Attached image from that night below)

We launched The Drill Protein Bars in Feb 2025.

For the first 3 months, it was brutal—19–20 hour workdays, manufacturing ourselves because we couldn’t afford to hire. Sleep was optional. Life was paused.

(Attached manufacturing grind images below)

Slowly, very slowly, we hired our first person. Then another. Shifted to a slightly bigger plant. Today, we have around 5 people working with us.

Now we’re on a mission to build India’s first macro + micro nutrition brand using only real, clean ingredients.

We’re available at 600+ touchpoints PAN India and are among the best-selling protein bars on FirstClub Bangalore.

We recently launched Crunchy Roasted Edamame, because nutritionally, it made complete sense as the next SKU—almost a replacement for makhana and regular namkeens.

For those who don’t know: edamame is soybean harvested at around 80% maturity. It’s much less processed than regular soybeans, more digestible, and more nutritious.

We launched mini packs:

	•	11–13 g protein

	•	4–5 g fibre

	•	MRP Rs 50 

	•	\~130 calories

	•	Low GI (18–20)

	•	Good fats

	•	Lower calories than peanuts

	•	Much lower carbs than makhana

We launched it in 4 flavours: Cheese, Nimbu Pudina, Piri Piri Lemon, and Sea Salt.

(Attached product & flavour images below)

Would genuinely love your thoughts on this product and how you see Indian snacking evolving.

Happy to answer any questions—about hustle, burnout, starting from zero, manufacturing, or my honest take on the protein market.

P.S. Investor rejections happened too. Many. Just didn’t want this post to get longer.

I’m a 38/M living by myself in my own very nice and extremely clean place in Boston. I'm in perfect health (recently tested during a routine physical, all negative), fit and trim, clean shaven, full head of hair, tall, very hygienic, and in the past modeled for a popular magazine. We can swap pics when we start chatting. I don’t do drugs or smoke, and I only drink when a social setting calls for it.

In terms of personality I’m kind, empathetic, very generous, and deeply passionate. I’m a successful and hardworking professional who is very disciplined, reliable, and take control in my professional life. Ideally you are a kind, fit, healthy, attractive woman. I'm looking for that spark that inspires the mind, soul, and body, makes the world look sharper and more beautiful, and makes us both even happier to be alive.

I love the arts, including visual, sculptural, music, performance, and poetry. I’m also a foodie and know well the best restaurants in the Boston area, and around the country. Unless you object, you will never pay for anything while we are dating and I will cover all meals, entertainment, travel, and the like. Call me old school.

I’m looking for a new physical and emotional and intellectual relationship. We can start with chats, followed by fantastic dinners in Boston’s best restaurants (my treat of course) and go from there. If it feels right, I hope we can start a real relationship and perhaps even something long term could ignite. I can host and I will respect our privacy, as my job requires.

My first week on Reddit has been very educational. I’ve learned that almost all women who post in r4r are bots, or people looking for subscribers, or fraudsters trying to get you to send them money in advance supposedly for gas (lol), or babysitters (!), or hotel rooms, etc.  Depressing, if occasionally absurd to the point of being funny.  I note this because I am looking for a real relationship, NOT a client relationship. I have no problem regularly paying for $800 dinners but I will never send someone money simply based on an online claim, especially in the age of easy AI fakes. So please don’t waste your time and mine if you are looking for someone to send you money before meeting.

Please send a DM if interested—we can exchange photos and more info about our more private likes and dislikes in chat. if we click, I would love to take you out for coffee, dessert, drinks, or dinner in Boston soon, which will be an easy icebreaker and confirm we are real, unlike the abundance of fake accounts here.

If you’ve made it this far and are real, I hope you drop me a message. Thank you for reading. ",1,1769268479.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

It's a bit easier when everyone is stood up in a pub, walking around and talking to each other. I still find it somewhat difficult, but not nearly to the same degree.

Threepeater - Buzzing trumpet  
Jalapeno - Vocals (laughing)  
Spikeweed - Pan flute  
Torchwood - Congas  
Tall-nut - Snare drum  
Cactus - Flute  
Blover - Arpeggio synth  
Split Pea - Piano  
Starfruit - Bell synth  
Pumpkin - Bongos  
Cabbage-pult - Tom drums  
Flower Pot - Bass  
Kernel-pult - Guiro  
Coffee Bean - Beatboxing  
Garlic - Coughing-like beatbox  
Umbrella Leaf - Tambourine  
Marigold - Vocals (singing musical notes)  
Melon-pult - Cymbals

Night garden:

Puff-shroom - Brass  
Sun-shroom - Steel pan  
Fume-shroom - Tuba  
Tomb Tangler - Castanets/Spoons  
Hypno-shroom - Theremin  
Scaredy-shroom - Brass  
Ice-shroom - Vocals (humming)  
Doom-shroom - Intense drums  
Plantern - Strings  
Magnet-shroom - Metal/Triangle

At first I thought it was OBS so I replace  PulseAudio by PipeWire. And I'm happy about what I can do on OBS with PipeWire.

My friends on discord also said my audio input was horrible last time. So I used the mic instead of using the build-in mic of my laptop. (it was better, but I know my mic can sound way better)

I think I have a global audio input problem. I did install PipreWire, Wireplumber, PavuControl and PWVUcontrol.

I think it may be a driver problem.

My mic is a Nor-Tec mic (and plug and play cheap mic that can do okay sound. You can find in the video an extract of how it sounded on Windows 10).

I put every info I can in that video. (What I say is not important, what is important is how it sound)

Hey everyone. Just moved to Jamshedpur and looking to make new friends... Esp since I know no one here, except my mother-in-law and my husband, and they don't really count iykwim... Anyone above 30 also looking to meet new people? 

**The plan**

Maybe catch up next Sunday (1st Feb) over a cup of coffee? A very chill thing. No pressure to stay if you don't feel the vibe. Somewhere central that's convenient for people who want to attend? 

**A little bit about me...** 

I'm 36, married, no kids but have a deranged German Shepherd which is kinda the same as having a child. I love to read. I used to be a professional chef. Now pursuing a writing career. Currently working on my first novel.

this is all because of my work and laptop screen.

i think I got the advanced version of burnout, 8 months of grinding, 10 hours daily.

and the worst thing? I can’t stop or rest. it’s my bread.

yeah I’m seeing good results in business, but in contrast, significant damage to my health.

I started understanding what hidden stress is, this is it. you are working, and you feel unwell and have difficulty breathing. you feel swelling or pressure in the head, and this is the fastest way to hair loss.

cortisol is at its peak.

I tried many ways to solve this, to protect my health and my business at the same time.

I tried many productivity tools, all meditation variations you can name…

yes, they helped a little bit.

but I thought it was time to control my reality by myself. I’m the controller here, not the screen.

I built my tool and called it “Ytterbium”, it’s the rarest element on planet Earth.

it has a smart system working with AI to watch me while working, not by camera, but by my behavior (mouse, keyboard, switching tabs…), and it detects when fatigue hits.

it’s so smart and simple, and it handles everything. I just need to work, and it sustains my health.

why it’s so simple:

I just type my task (like writing this reddit post), and AI tells me what type of task it is. for example, the focus mode is a creative one, and it gives the number of suggested sessions. it will increase the number of sessions later if it notices they are not enough, to reach the point where you will not harm yourself by overworking and still complete the task fast.

the fun begins after AI selects the focus mode and number of sessions. the smart system starts watching you and detecting any fatigue or burnout signs. it’s so accurate that when it detects them, it will stop you and notify you to stop right now. and guess what’s next? it gives you relaxation exercises like getting sunlight for 5 minutes, or neck exercises, or just standing up in silence (this is so beneficial instead of doomscrolling or overworking). when you finish those relaxation exercises, you enter the next session… and so on until you finish your task.

surprisingly, I have used it for 3 months. bro, since then I finish all my tasks faster, my health is perfect, bright eyes, good posture, and thank god my hair is strong enough I didn’t lose it before, and now it’s even better, growing well. no stress, no cortisol during work. I’m using that hormone in a meaningful way, like lifting huge weights…

all of that for the price of a coffee, $5. come on brother, with all these benefits and AI systems, for free? at least to keep things running normally (hosting, AI services…)

if you want to work smarter and not harder like I did in the past, and sustain your health, you can DM me.

and I swear I’m waiting for your feedback to make it 1000x better and create a better place to work.

my sleep now is better. this is all I wanted.

1qlpivf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1qlpivf/how_to_tell_if_someone_is_flirting_with_you_the/,How to Tell if Someone Is FLIRTING With You: The Science-Based Signs You Keep Missing,"I spent months studying attraction patterns, combing through psychology research, watching behavioral experts break down flirting cues, reading books on body language and honestly? Most of us are terrible at reading flirting signals. Not because we're stupid, but because our brains are wired to protect us from rejection. Your brain would rather assume nobody's interested than risk the embarrassment of being wrong. It's a survival mechanism that made sense when social rejection meant getting kicked out of the tribe, but now it just makes you miss opportunities.

The real issue isn't that people are too subtle. It's that we've convinced ourselves nobody could possibly be interested in us, so we rationalize away every single sign. I've watched friends talk themselves out of obvious interest because ""they were probably just being nice"" or ""they smile at everyone like that."" This defensive pessimism feels safe but it's killing your chances.

**The eye contact thing everyone misses.** Most dating advice says ""prolonged eye contact means interest"" but that's oversimplified. What actually matters is the pattern. Research from social psychologist Monica Moore shows that interested people create eye contact, break it, then look back to see if you're still looking. That checking back is the key signal. If someone holds eye contact for 3 seconds, looks away, then glances back within 10 seconds, that's not random. They're checking if you noticed them noticing you.

**Mirroring your movements** is another huge tell that flies under most people's radar. When someone's attracted to you, they unconsciously copy your body language. You lean in, they lean in. You touch your face, they touch theirs a few seconds later. You cross your legs, they adjust their position similarly. This isn't deliberate, it's your brain's way of building rapport and signaling ""we're on the same wavelength."" The book *What Every BODY is Saying* by Joe Navarro breaks this down beautifully. Navarro spent 25 years as an FBI counterintelligence agent reading body language, and his insights on attraction cues are incredibly sharp. The way he explains how our limbic brain betrays our interest through tiny unconscious movements made me realize how much I'd been missing. This is hands down the best practical guide to reading nonverbal communication I've encountered.

**They find excuses to be near you.** This one seems obvious but we constantly dismiss it. If someone consistently ends up in your vicinity, sits next to you when other seats are available, or ""happens"" to be at the coffee shop you mentioned, that's not coincidence. Proximity is one of the most reliable indicators because it requires effort. Nobody accidentally keeps showing up where you are.

**The tone shift** is something most people completely overlook. Research on vocal modulation shows that when people are attracted to someone, their voice changes slightly. Women's voices often get a bit higher and softer. Men's voices can drop slightly lower. But more importantly, there's this warmth and energy that enters someone's voice when they're talking to someone they're into versus how they talk to everyone else. Pay attention to whether someone sounds more animated and engaged with you compared to how they interact with others.

**Unnecessary touching** is a massive green light. A hand on your arm during conversation, brushing against you when there's plenty of room, adjusting your collar or picking lint off your shirt. These ""grooming behaviors"" signal comfort and interest. The key word is unnecessary. If the touch serves no functional purpose except to make physical contact, that's intentional.

**They ask personal questions and actually remember your answers.** This goes beyond small talk. When someone's interested, they want to know about your life, your thoughts, your experiences. And here's the crucial part: they bring up details you mentioned in previous conversations. ""How did that presentation go?"" or ""Did you end up watching that show you mentioned?"" This proves they've been thinking about you between interactions.

The app **Mend** has solid content on reading relationship signals and understanding attraction patterns. Their stuff on decoding mixed signals and building confidence in social situations is genuinely useful, not the generic ""just be yourself"" garbage you see everywhere.

For anyone wanting to go deeper into attraction psychology and relationship patterns, there's **BeFreed**, an AI learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google. It pulls from research papers, books like the ones mentioned above, expert interviews, and relationship psychology content to create personalized audio learning plans. You can ask it something specific like ""help me read flirting signals as someone who overthinks everything"" and it'll build a structured plan with episodes you can customize from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are addictive, you can pick anything from a deep, calming tone to something more energetic depending on your mood. What makes it useful is the adaptive learning plan that evolves based on your specific struggles with reading social cues or building confidence in dating situations.

**Laughing at things that aren't that funny** is biology betraying someone's interest. We laugh more around people we're attracted to, even when the joke is mediocre. If someone consistently laughs at your comments, finds reasons to playfully tease you, or seems to think you're funnier than you actually are, they're probably into you.

**The phone tilt.** Dr. David Givens, director of the Center for Nonverbal Studies, points out that people angle their torso and feet toward what interests them. If someone's body is turned toward you during group conversations, if their feet point at you even when their attention seems elsewhere, that's subconscious interest. We orient ourselves toward what we want to be closer to.

Here's the uncomfortable truth most people avoid: **you probably already know when someone's flirting with you.** Your gut picks up on these patterns, but your conscious mind talks you out of trusting your instincts. We create elaborate explanations for why someone's behavior doesn't mean what it obviously means because acknowledging attraction is scary. It makes you vulnerable.

**The No Contact Rule** by Natalie Lue dives deep into recognizing patterns in how people show interest versus politeness. Lue is a breakup and boundaries expert who's helped thousands understand relationship dynamics. Her breakdown of genuine interest signals versus surface level niceness is brutally honest and incredibly clarifying. The section on trusting your gut versus rationalizing away obvious signs hit hard. If you constantly find yourself confused about whether people like you, this book will save you years of misreading situations.

The reality is flirting isn't some mysterious code. It's usually pretty obvious once you stop assuming nobody could possibly be interested in you. Someone who's attracted to you will find reasons to talk to you, be near you, touch you, make you laugh, and keep your attention. They'll light up slightly when you enter a room.

1qlpiu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NichePerfumes/comments/1qlpiu8/pineward_perfume_full_sample_set_review/,Pineward Perfume Full Sample Set Review,"I purchased the Pineward Perfume full sample set back in May of 2025 and wrote out short reviews for each sample provided in the box. Hats off to the Pineward team! The packaging is beautifully done and they clearly enjoy crafting fragrances.

I'm interested to hear everyone's thoughts and see if this influences/de-influences anyone from pulling the trigger on these intriguing scents. Overall, I really like the brand. I can have a very sensitive and picky nose but adore sampling unique perfumes. This was quite a journey.

The list is organized alphabetically. Here goes nothin'!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Acadian** (7/10) - Starts off with a sharp woody scent that blends nicely into damp earth. Leans masculine.

**Akero** (7/10) - Patchouli softened with sweet apple. An excellent Autumn scent for those who love an earthy and fruity apple fragrance.

**Apple Tabac** (8/10) - This shows up precisely as promised with a honey sweet bite of apple, tobacco, and dried fruit. Imagine apple cider on a porch in the middle of Autumn. Leans feminine.

**Bindebole** (6/10) - Opens up to a masculine aroma, likely thanks to the crisp pine and warm cedar. Overall a clean yet woody fragrance where the citrus adds a touch of brightness. Masculine.

**Boreal** (8/10) - A resinous and minty fresh pine that presents a pleasant smokiness when warmed on the skin. Unisex leaning slightly masculine.

**Brokilan** (6/10) - A true pine scent. This is what I would imagine a burly lumberjack wearing on a weekend date night. Pine needles, cones, resin, and wood. Masculine.

**Bucolic** (1/10) - Powdery fresh… urinal cake? Do not pass Go, do not collect $200.

**Caravansary** (8/10) - Herbs, tea, snow-kissed fir branches. An herbal pine that hints at vanilla and floral tones. Dries down to a clean and mellow scent. Beware of wearing light colors! The perfume is a deep blue. Unisex with an herbal feminine lean.

**Clemenpine** (6/10) - Sweet citrus peel settles atop leather and fresh cut wood. Some sweetness and essences of blooms arise once the stronger scents find their place. Leans feminine.

**Coastal Veil** (8/10) - upon first sniff, it smells exactly the way you would expect a fresh pine fragrance to show up. Pleasantly fragrant, sharp and peppery. The eucalyptus sweeps through at the end, leaving a hint of earthy freshness. Leans masculine.

**Coffee Tabac** (10/10) - I expected a heavy sweetness but was met instead with a pleasantly spiced vanilla coffee bean. The tobacco, wood, and resinous properties encourage the top notes to linger. The dry down becomes an alluring sweet and spicy vanilla on the skin. Unisex.

**Cotswold** (5/10) - Smells as if a fresh pine tree spritzed with vanilla extract were on fire. This one is heavy on the smoke and hits you like the smell of a crackling bonfire. It's incredibly interesting but difficult to wear, I'd imagine. I suppose this is unisex but a scent that heavy on smoke would generally be considered masculine.

**Delfiño** (8/10) - Starts with a bright citrus peel and settles into a light bed of leafy green. She’s summery, she’s likable, she’s probably on the Amalfi coast right now. Likely an easy wear for most. Feminine.

**Eldritch** (5/10) - Dark, sharp, and earthy. Mysterious with a slight welcoming warmth to keep you coming back. The smoke and patchouli take over in the end. The sharpness in the dry down is intriguing. Leans masculine.

**Fanghorn II** (6/10) - A thick murky pine. Fir and pine needles hit the ground and mingle with lichen, moss, and wet earth. Masculine.

**Funerie** (5/10) - Earth, wood, and a hint of herb-like florals. There’s a dankness to it, likely caused by the mushroom and decaying floral and thick wood notes. The fragrance is certainly complex and one that earned quite a few wafts to “figure out”. Leans masculine.

**Greymist** (8/10) - A more sheer experience in the Pineward collection. It is crisp, airy, and fresh like facing the piny forest wind on a winter day. While it is very pine forward, it hints at a citrus element. A very clean and easy to wear fragrance. Unisex.

**Gristmill** (5/10) - Smoky and nutty wood that keeps warm with amber. Heavy on cedar. Leans masculine.

**Hayloft** (5/10) - Sweet honey and hay. This one really lives up to its promises. Very warm and sweet, leaning gourmand. I know people that would love this but I’m not much of a thick and sweet fragrance person. Leans feminine.

**Icefall** (7/10) - Cedar, pine, and sandalwood sharpened by a punch of grapefruit. Leans masculine.

**Ivymoss** (7/10) - It’s leafy, mossy, and curiously fresh. I imagine a patch of moss-coated conifers surrounding a floor of creeping ivy and mint. Citrus notes - especially lemon verbena - lace through the greenery. This may be a good pick for those who like tomato leaf notes or floral lovers looking to diverge from the norm. Feminine.

**Juniperus** (10/10) - Very herbal with juniper, rosemary, and lavender. This is what I would imagine an alchemy witch’s pockets to smell like. Settles into a beautifully botanic lavender. Herbal feminine.  
(Added note: I brought the sample with me as a travel perfume and ended up loving it more every time I used it. I’ve purchased a full bottle and am awaiting its arrival as we speak.)

**Lime Cola** (3/10) - Yep! The initial fragrance really does give a hit of citrusy cola which is very intriguing, but dries down in a “Pine-Sol-esque” way on the skin.

**Meadowmoss** (4/10) - A powdery and slightly earthy floral that vaguely and nostalgically reminds me of my grandmother’s vanity drawers. Excellent for classic and vintage perfume lovers. Feminine.

**Murkwood** (5/10) - Woody licorice with a wisp of earth at the end. Masculine.

**Nocturnis** (4/10) - Opens with a clean pine quickly followed by a mysteriously deep sweetness, likely brought forth in the hay, tobacco, and herbal/floral notes. It is then grounded by patchouli, amber, and earthen oak moss. Unisex with a masculine lean.

**Noki** (8/10) - It opens up to a mysterious sweetness, almost like a wad of mint bubblegum… in a good way. On the dry down, it offers a promised note of tropical fruitiness. The sandalwood and ambergris send some warmth and creaminess through otherwise bright aromas. Noki is an overall easy and enjoyable scent. Excellent for spring and summer. Feminine.

**Oxylus** (5/10) - Damp, earthy pine needles. Makes me think of walking through a cool misty forest after a few days of rain.

**Pastoral** (8/10) - Starts with a sweet bite of apricot that smooths into herbal tea. Think of a dried fruit plate and a warm cup of tea surrounded by buzzing bees. Calms into a lovely sweet honey. This is what I imagine Matilda’s Miss Honey smells like.

**Ponderosa** (6/10) - A sweet and buttery ponderosa pine. The sweetness is creamy from the vanilla, butterscotch, and beeswax. The strawberry lends a slight fruitiness that lingers between the pine and warm touches. Feminine.

**Revelries** (8/10) - Begins with a stimulating spiced apple that leans into rum and further spice. Oud and hazelnut add smoky and sweet warmth, respectively. If you want to smell like an Autumn market, this is it. It didn’t settle well on me and became a bit sour but may be lovely on someone else. Unisex with a sweet feminine lean.

**Shire** (7/10) - Opens up with apple-like sweetness followed by an earthy and nutty warmth from hay and oatmeal. Would be excellent as a honeyed Fall fragrance.

**Snoqualmie** (3/10) - Starts off quite piney and dried down to an almost old lady smell on me. Fir, cedar, tamarack, and resin.

**Steading** (5/10) - Maple syrup but make it perfume. Wood and hops linger beneath the sugary warmth. Imagine a syrup-drenched pancake on a camping trip. Obviously gourmand.

**Sturbridge** (8/10) - I don’t know what I was expecting with an amber-colored fragrance called “Sturbridge” but it wasn’t this. It begins with a bright fruity element from the apple and then sharpens in the presence of pine. The apple and pine combination is then smoothed over with frankincense, myrrh, and amber.

**Subalpine** (9/10) - It starts out very pine forward, as the name suggests. The pepper comes through nicely just behind the fir. This feels true unisex and wears on the sheer side.

**Tome** (5/10) - Sweet leathery vanilla. This would be a good fragrance for those who love the smell of old books on a rainy day.

**Treacle** (3/10) - As the name suggests, it is very thick and sweet. This would be a gourmand-lover’s treat with molasses, tobacco, and raisin reigning supreme. Not for me, definitely for someone else.

**Velvetine** (8/10) - You’re faced initially with a beautiful vanilla aroma as if opening a bottle of extract. A hint of clove creeps through as it is warmed further by wood, amber, and ambergris. Perfect for winter.

**White Fir** (8/10) - A very pleasant first whiff! This fragrance is brighter than most of its siblings thanks to orange, ginger, and vetiver. The bright notes play well with the sharp, fresh pine. Some spiced notes calm the brighter levels, bringing it lightly back down to earth. This could be a year-round fragrance. Unisex but leans slightly feminine.

**Christmas/Winter (2025):**

**Christmas Wine** (8/10) - Tart, spicy, and herbal. The pine, juniper berry, and spices take center stage at the finish. A fragrance for those who would prefer to smell like Yule over Christmas. Deep fruity feminine. 

**Gingerbread** (9/10) - It smells *exactly* as promised. Imagine the aroma of a baked gingerbread cookie: festive, classic, and endearing. If you want to smell like the epitome of holiday baking, this is the way to do it. Settles into the skin with a sweet and spicy ginger. Even with the description in mind, I do find that it settles slightly more mature than one might assume. Could be unisex, but with mom’s baking in mind. 

**Glühwein** (8/10) - A bit sweeter than its Christmas Wine cousin. If you give it a moment to settle on the skin, Glühwein will transform from grape-like fruitiness to a deeper winter berry with a mild hint of winter greenery. This is the sweet winter digestif of fragrance. Deep fruity feminine. 

**Sugar Plum** (7/10) - Sweet, plummy, and cute. It reminds me somehow of the color purple with a rounded fruity note topped with sugar. Sweet feminine.

**Additional Notes if you’ve made it this far:**

Very recently, I ended up purchasing a full bottle of Juniperus in preparation for spring as well as a small bottle of Gingerbread. I’m sitting on Coffee Tabac and Velvetine as I continue to explore spiced vanilla fragrances. Though I tend not to label myself as much of a gourmand-lover, my propensity toward Gingerbread and Coffee Tabac have me thinking I should be exploring more non-cloying gourmands.  

A family member of mine is a huge fan of Apple Tabac and Sugar Plum, both of which are lightly sweet and fruity. They smell lovely on her.

Q: Why mugs? 
A: I love my one of a kind imperfect handmade mugs. I love the feeling of drinking coffee/tea in the morning out of a piece of art that was a joy to make. I feel like there are so many options of forms and handles and glazes and techniques to try with mugs and I want to try them all. Plus when I started pottery I hated handles (and kinda still do), so I will keep on making handles until I love handles. 

Q: Why 99?
A: I wanted to give myself permission to not be perfectionist and to explore, and 100 just seemed excessive. 

Q: Are these really your first mugs?
A: Basically yeah. I started pottery in Summer 2025, 2 of these 27 were started in that quarter, the rest of the 27 started in Winter 2025. I did do other vessels with handles but I didn't understand shrink rate so they ended up more like espresso cups or tea cups for dolls. More disclaimers: a lot of these look better as photos than in real life, there are chips, patches, blisters, glazes stuck to cookies, sharp lips, handles that feel too weak, and other things angled gracefully away from the camera. But they are definitely getting better.

Q: 27 down, 72 to go, what's next?
Currently there are a bunch sitting on the greenware shelves and if you are interested I can share them and they come through. I am trying some different techniques and glazes and clay bodies, we'll see how they turn out.

I've been lurking here since I started pottery and was inspired to finally get a reddit account to share and feel very grateful for the support of you internet strangers. Please share your favorite glazes/clay bodies/techniques/forms that I can incorporate in my next 72 mugs. ",42,1769267660.0,Pottery,2,1.0,False

Let's be honest, for years, the humble drip coffee maker was the king of home brewing. But in today's world, we crave more. More flavor, more options, and definitely more freedom.

That's where brands like HiBREW are changing the game. Forget needing a separate machine for every coffee style.

Imagine upgrading your morning routine with a single, sleek machine that does it all.

What truly sets HiBREW apart in a crowded market?

*   **Unrivaled Pod Compatibility:** Brew with K-Cup, Nespresso, Dolce Gusto, or ground coffee. Your coffee, your rules.

Just tested it again and it started. Is this a transition period and will it regulate? Before this, I was eating meat, some fruit like blueberries, butter, milk, cheese, potatoes, and rice. My bowel movements seem to be pretty decent on that. I want to increase my carbs especially from sweet sources. Anyone else struggle with this?

Sample day of eating:

Raw carrot salad upon waking

Breakfast: 2 eggs cooked in a tbsp of butter, low fat yogurt with a couple tbsp of honey and some frozen fruit (mango, pineapple, or blueberries), an oz of raw Parmesan, and a coffee with about a cup of low fat milk and a few tbsp honey

Lunch: an oz of raw Parmesan with another cup of low fat milk, 8 oz fresh orange juice, 2 apples with a couple tbsp tbsp honey, and another serving of frozen fruit

Dinner: mashed potatoes with some butter, 8 oz of meat (beef, low pufa pork, salmon)

I (21M) share an apartment with my roommate “Ben” (22M). We split rent evenly. No written rules beyond basic stuff like cleaning shared areas and not blasting music late at night.

I wake up at 5:30 AM on weekdays for school + a part-time job. Ben doesn’t work mornings and usually sleeps around 2–3 AM gaming or watching videos.

I try to be quiet, but realistically I still make some noise: alarm goes off once, I shower, make coffee, and leave by 6:15. I don’t play music, I don’t talk loudly, and I prep most of my stuff the night before.

Recently Ben started complaining that I’m “ruining his sleep” and said I should either: • change my alarm to vibrate only

• stop showering in the morning

• or wait to make coffee until I leave

I told him I’m already being reasonable and that if sleep is an issue, he could go to bed earlier or use earplugs / white noise.

He said that I’m the one causing the disturbance, so it’s my responsibility to adjust. He also told a few friends who now think I’m being inconsiderate and “prioritizing productivity over basic respect.”

I honestly don’t think waking up for work and school at a normal time is unreasonable, but now I’m second-guessing myself.

We have to hide the compost bin which has a latched lid that closes right because he started knocking it over to try to eat food scraps.

Our vet has us feeding him digestive care wet food and kibble with probiotics every 2 hours.. he cannot free feed because he would eat the whole bag of dry food if it was available.

\-Infection control (pertaining ONLY to closing or capping units):  If theres an outbreak on the inpatient units, the admin typically ignore requests from attendings or even unit directors to throttle admissions. But if Infection Control snaps a finger, the unit magically becomes closed.

this is all because of my work and laptop screen.

i think I got the advanced version of burnout, 8 months of grinding, 10 hours daily.

and the worst thing? I can’t stop or rest. it’s my bread.

yeah I’m seeing good results in business, but in contrast, significant damage to my health.

I started understanding what hidden stress is, this is it. you are working, and you feel unwell and have difficulty breathing. you feel swelling or pressure in the head, and this is the fastest way to hair loss.

cortisol is at its peak.

I tried many ways to solve this, to protect my health and my business at the same time.

I tried many productivity tools, all meditation variations you can name…

yes, they helped a little bit.

but I thought it was time to control my reality by myself. I’m the controller here, not the screen.

I built my tool and called it “Ytterbium”, it’s the rarest element on planet Earth.

it has a smart system working with AI to watch me while working, not by camera, but by my behavior (mouse, keyboard, switching tabs…), and it detects when fatigue hits.

it’s so smart and simple, and it handles everything. I just need to work, and it sustains my health.

why it’s so simple:

I just type my task (like writing this reddit post), and AI tells me what type of task it is. for example, the focus mode is a creative one, and it gives the number of suggested sessions. it will increase the number of sessions later if it notices they are not enough, to reach the point where you will not harm yourself by overworking and still complete the task fast.

the fun begins after AI selects the focus mode and number of sessions. the smart system starts watching you and detecting any fatigue or burnout signs. it’s so accurate that when it detects them, it will stop you and notify you to stop right now. and guess what’s next? it gives you relaxation exercises like getting sunlight for 5 minutes, or neck exercises, or just standing up in silence (this is so beneficial instead of doomscrolling or overworking). when you finish those relaxation exercises, you enter the next session… and so on until you finish your task.

surprisingly, I have used it for 3 months. bro, since then I finish all my tasks faster, my health is perfect, bright eyes, good posture, and thank god my hair is strong enough I didn’t lose it before, and now it’s even better, growing well. no stress, no cortisol during work. I’m using that hormone in a meaningful way, like lifting huge weights…

all of that for the price of a coffee, $5. come on brother, with all these benefits and AI systems, for free? at least to keep things running normally (hosting, AI services…)

if you want to work smarter and not harder like I did in the past, and sustain your health, you can DM me.

and I swear I’m waiting for your feedback to make it 1000x better and create a better place to work.

my sleep now is better. this is all I wanted.

I broke no contact twice, and you were right that it was unfair and inappropriate to message you.

But you didn’t need to be so cruel.

It’s been a week since you sent me 6 paragraphs. 6 paragraphs of cruelty. 

You diminished my timeline of healing, a month after you destroyed my hopes and dreams and the future I thought we were building together. You said you had expected me to rewrite my brain and thoughts by now, easier said than done after a year together, have you really moved on without me so quickly? I know reaching out was wrong, continuing to care about you after we ended was wrong but I just wanted a moment of kindness. A moment of humanity and recognition that I’m going through the worst pain that anyone has inflicted on me. And you somehow made it about you.

You twisted my words “I wish I could feel you” into something sexual, something objectifying; you know how much that hurts me that you have weaponised and turned my words into something so different? I just meant that I wish I could have your presence again. I wish I could have you next to me in my bed, my eyes basking in how the rising sun would illuminate your figure as we woke up together . I wish I could make you breakfast again, make your coffee the way you liked it again, hear your voice say my name, laugh and say “I love you” again. 

You didn’t need to go to the trouble of putting in bold: I am happy. How you were an adult and how you didn’t need me to tell you how to take care of yourself. All I said and hoped was that you were happier now that we weren’t together but that you had found peace and were in a better headspace. All I wished was that you were talking to and surrounded by your support networks, the people and friends that were important to you that I meant. I know how you self isolate. I know you have a habit of withdrawing, doom scrolling and isolating yourself when things get too much. It wasn’t meant to be a dig at you, I just wanted to know you were okay.

You accused me of being manipulative - when I said you should let the D&D group know that you were okay. They were your friends too, we’ve been playing together for two years. Are they disappointed in how you ended the relationship? Yes. But I don’t want to hate you, I thought they and the hobby we shared was a part of who we were as people. We’ve celebrated the DM’s 30th, our friend’s engagement, we interwove ourselves in the tapestry of connections with our friends and their partners. None of them have heard from you since October. 

You rejected the possibility of us reconnecting (the idea that you brought up first for us to be friends one day) unless I was in therapy and could adhere to the boundaries that you took offence that I wanted (and have struggled to adhere with). The fact you are lecturing me about needing therapy is so unhinged - I didn’t deserve to have had such a wound inflicted on me. I now need to have therapy because of what you did to me. Given that you have had therapy for the last 10 years and still are doing avoidant discards, ending a year of our relationship by text messages because you were too chicken shit to confront me with ending it speaks volumes; it doesn’t really look like therapy is working or has worked for you.

I let my self respect die because I hoped for one brief moment, yeah - we can be friends again someday. It wasn’t what I wanted. But I wanted to keep you and the connection, I wanted that tether back in my life. So yeah, I acknowledge I fucked up. I couldn’t adhere to time, space and distance. But you don’t have a right to lash out at me about making a mistake and boundaries when you ended the relationship via text message, at 11 pm after I finish work. It’s not fair that I’m criticised when you made the unilateral decision to end us and blindsided me. It’s not fair that you put pressure on me to be healed or that I have to put myself back together before you’d even consider the idea of us talking again.

And even after everything, I miss you. I deserved better, the filter of who you are as a person, and how you ended the relationship when there was a breakdown in communication speaks volumes. 

I’ve started rebuilding myself again. In the time we’ve been separated, I lost weight, I hit new personal bests at the gym. I booked tickets to go to three concerts next month. I’m spending time with the people who were your friends too, and who wanted to be friends with you. I’ve booked in some leave for a trip to Korea and Japan. I know how much you loved Kpop - I’ve always wanted to go but I also do think it’s a vindicated fuck you to allow myself to go to a country you’ve always wanted to visit. Our D&D group picked me too - I was ready to leave our friends because I didn’t want you to lose them. Turns out they picked me, they chose me and they didn’t want to lose me. Because I still made the effort to stay connected, I apologised for something you did, I kept them in my life because they help me and support me. We played a session tonight and it was fun. But the chair you used to occupy is so empty and every time I turn, I still hope and wish you were next to me. 

I missed what we could have been. I missed how important you were to be. I missed how we had our lives interwoven together.

I’m going to a singles meet tomorrow. I don’t want to rush into a relationship but I’m going with friends. I’m single, in my thirties and feeling flirty. I know I am a prize, I know my worth, and I know I did everything I could with the tools that I had and the information you gave me whilst we were in a relationship.

But you chose to walk away.

I miss you. And I hope whomever you find next, I hope you treat them better than how you treated me. Because I don’t want anyone to ever be hurt the way you hurt me ever again.",3,1769266910.0,UnsentTexts,1,1.0,False

During the day it's not a problem, but at night it can keep me asleep.

These tingles seem connected to my central nervous system because I note that if I drink just one cup of coffee (and even if I drink it in the morning) then the following night the tingling will be more pronounced.  I lie awake in bed not only because of the tingles which ""shoot"" hither and thither all over my body, but because my CNS is activated and there's no sleep in my system.

I am 71 and so my skin is a bit drier and thinner than it used to be, so I wonder if the tingling is caused by the skin stretching.  So I have wondered if I should experiment by NOT having a hot shower every morning, or by rubbing a skin cream all over my body directly after my morning shower, so as to lubricate my skin.

I started understanding what hidden stress is, this is it. you are working, and you feel unwell and have difficulty breathing. you feel swelling or pressure in the head, and this is the fastest way to hair loss.

cortisol is at its peak.

I tried many ways to solve this, to protect my health and my business at the same time.

I tried many productivity tools, all meditation variations you can name…

yes, they helped a little bit.

but I thought it was time to control my reality by myself. I’m the controller here, not the screen.

I built my tool and called it “Ytterbium”, it’s the rarest element on planet Earth.

it has a smart system working with AI to watch me while working, not by camera, but by my behavior (mouse, keyboard, switching tabs…), and it detects when fatigue hits.

it’s so smart and simple, and it handles everything. I just need to work, and it sustains my health.

why it’s so simple:

I just type my task (like writing this reddit post), and AI tells me what type of task it is. for example, the focus mode is a creative one, and it gives the number of suggested sessions. it will increase the number of sessions later if it notices they are not enough, to reach the point where you will not harm yourself by overworking and still complete the task fast.

the fun begins after AI selects the focus mode and number of sessions. the smart system starts watching you and detecting any fatigue or burnout signs. it’s so accurate that when it detects them, it will stop you and notify you to stop right now. and guess what’s next? it gives you relaxation exercises like getting sunlight for 5 minutes, or neck exercises, or just standing up in silence (this is so beneficial instead of doomscrolling or overworking). when you finish those relaxation exercises, you enter the next session… and so on until you finish your task.

surprisingly, I have used it for 3 months. bro, since then I finish all my tasks faster, my health is perfect, bright eyes, good posture, and thank god my hair is strong enough I didn’t lose it before, and now it’s even better, growing well. no stress, no cortisol during work. I’m using that hormone in a meaningful way, like lifting huge weights…

all of that for the price of a coffee, $5. come on brother, with all these benefits and AI systems, for free? at least to keep things running normally (hosting, AI services…)

if you want to work smarter and not harder like I did in the past, and sustain your health, you can DM me, your feedback to make it 1000x better and create a better place to work.

After years of binge drinking, I stopped booze. It was always the abused, ""lights out"" tool for me. Still unstable after 5 years of abstinence, and weekly therapy for 7 years to address childhood trauma, +  the SSRIs, increasing doses, and I was more irritable than ever.  r
Raging and racing in my chest, in my belly, in my looping brain. I was chasing dopamine all day, chugging coffee to satisfy a never satiated reward system and the perpetual chaos I was accustomed to since childhood. 4 pisses a night is clearly an over active nervous system, and the random songs on loop in my head as I wake up clearly my nervous system was never settled. TMI, but since reducing my Lexapro from 20 mg to 10. My number twos have recovered to near "" perfect poops "" after years of irritable bowels. 

So time was up, I could not explode in front of my young boys ever again, and scare my wife. I could not retreat to isolation and be the confusing personality in the house like my alcoholic parents. I was exhausted and worried. My gram had k#lled her self from presumed bipolar at 50. I'm 42 and the symptoms have been ramping. So I finally got to a psychiatrist and here we are a month into diagnosis and the holiday emotional hangover has cleared. 

2 weeks into 25 mg Lemotrigine (ramping to 200) and already feeling immediate effects. My learnings uncovered:


Lamotrigine does not permanently rewire neurons in the way learning does, but it does change the operating conditions of the network over time.

What can improve with sustained stability
• Reduced kindling. Fewer episodes can reduce future episode sensitivity.
• Improved stress tolerance. The system stops being chronically primed.
• Better sleep regulation, which further reduces excitability.
• Less feedback loop amplification between anxiety, mood, and physiology.

This can make the brain easier to manage.
What usually does not permanently change
• Baseline excitability traits
• Genetic channel dynamics
• Vulnerability to stress induced dysregulation
• Bipolar spectrum cycling tendency
----------

I'm feeling the reduced kindling and the calmer baseline already, and I'm hopeful for a more peaceful life of gratitude and presence with my beautiful family.

1qlovdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/fujifilm/comments/1qlovdn/opinions_xm5/,Opinions XM5,"For context I've been shooting for just over 20 years and my current workhorse is the Sony A7RV. I had the XT5 and thought it was a bit slow for my liking, but loved the colors and simulations. When I say ""slow"" I mean slow as in every input I made took micro seconds to adjust, turning the exposure dial I'd frequently over or undershoot my intended target because the input didn't happen instantaneously, same with iso, the menu input was laggy. I feel like Fuji is for folks who really enjoy slowing down, composing, having a sip of coffee etc. then snapping a shot, but unfortunately for my use case it just wasn't resonating with my style.

Long story long- I have some lenses sitting around and I'm contemplating getting another Fuji to try or just selling the lenses and calling it a day. I'm considering the XM5 1. because of it's price, and 2. because of it's size. I don't carry my Sony equipment everywhere because of it's bulk, I drive a soft top Jeep and I'm sure as hell not leaving it in there when I'm gone. I figured the XM5 is small enough that I can slide it into the middle console or under the seat, as well as it be pocketable. I'm going into it with the proper expectations this time for what it is and isn't to include performance and obviously no view finder. Do we have anyone here with ample photography experience who've maybe been outside the Fuji platform as well who has any experience with the XM5? It just looks sort of fun and something more spirited than my iPhone16 Pro as an EDC.

Thanks in advance!

1qlonfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockDAGInvestors/comments/1qlonfr/blockdag_investors_community_ama_recap/,BlockDAG Investors Community AMA recap,"The transcript details a live session hosted by Reed, Mo, and Lisa, addressing serious allegations of fraud, mismanagement, and unethical marketing practices against Block DAG (BDAG) and its leadership, particularly Gerhardt Kizalos (GK) and former Chief Marketing Officer Nick Vanderberg. The speakers present evidence and outline their plan to take legal action and establish a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to reclaim the project for the community.

I. Opening & Context

•	Technical Glitches: The session began with apologies for technical difficulties related to a new channel configuration for live streaming.

•	Smear Campaign: The speakers (Reed, Mo, Lisa, and Pyrex, a separate project) allege they are targets of a smear campaign orchestrated by Block DAG/WPRO (a media entity controlled by GK).

◦	False articles claimed Mo was paid $1.1 million and Reed $700,000, which Mo vehemently denies, offering his wallet address for public audit.

◦	Block DAG published names of ""winners"" for a 10 BTC auction, which the speakers suggest is a deliberate action coinciding with the smear campaign.

◦	WPRO is accused of leaking their information to hackers, harassment attempts, and compromising Mo's Reddit group.

◦	The same ""Analytic Insight"" website, controlled by WPRO, that publishes smear articles against the speakers is also promoting Block DAG and ZKP Blockchain, casting doubt on its credibility.

II. Key Allegations and Evidence Against Block DAG

The speakers presented a range of evidence to support their claims of Block DAG's deceptive practices:

•	Misrepresentation of Return on Investment (ROI):

◦	Despite Nick Vanderberg (CMO) repeatedly stating that Block DAG never promised returns (as heard in an audio clip), early marketing campaigns (sponsored articles by WPRO) explicitly promised high ROIs, including ""30,000% ROI explosion,"" ""50X ROI at launch,"" and projected token values of $10, $20, or $50.

◦	A ""price projection calculator"" on the Block DAG dashboard also allowed users to see projected high returns.

◦	A recent email from Block DAG, sent days before the live session, explicitly guaranteed ""50X ROI at launch,"" directly contradicting Nick's claims and potentially creating legal liability.

•	False Claims Regarding Miners, Holders, and Exchanges:

◦	Miners: Block DAG articles claimed 17,000 ASIC miners were shipped globally, yet no investors have received them. Now, delivery is pushed until after launch. Nick's audio from December 31st showed shifting timelines and excuses for miner payments (X30s, X100s, X10s), which Reed believes are still unpaid.

◦	Holders: Initial claims of 312,000 holders were later reduced to 151,000 by Nick.

◦	Exchanges: Block DAG marketed ""20 confirmed exchanges."" GK later admitted this was a speculative marketing claim made before any exchanges were secured, and that launching on too many exchanges would deplete liquidity too quickly.

•	Tokenomics Mismanagement and Overselling:

◦	Block DAG leadership was warned about overselling tokens but continued to do so through ""cash grabs"" and ""Double Up"" promotions.

◦	This led to an inflated token supply, with some wallets holding vast amounts of tokens for minimal spend and zero vesting.

◦	To mitigate the overselling, a ""39% compression/conversion schedule"" was introduced, but Reed argues the math doesn't add up, as they claimed to sell 125 billion tokens into a 50 billion token supply.

•	Compliance and Transparency Issues:

◦	Investors were led to believe Block DAG was registered under FSA jurisdiction (seizureless), but the FSA issued a warning stating Block DAG was not authorized to sell tokens in that jurisdiction.

◦	GK admitted to funneling an estimated $100 million from presale funds to WPRO for marketing, which then made the misleading ROI promises.

◦	GK flatly refused to publish Block DAG's code, citing fears of replication, while WPRO-controlled media criticizes other projects for not having public code (despite Pyrex having an open GitHub).

•	Leadership's Demeanor and Lack of Accountability:

◦	Nick Vanderberg, in an audio clip, displayed a ""pompous"" and ""arrogant"" attitude, suggesting investor funds could be used to ""blow up smoke"" and dismissing expectations of returns as ""ludicrous."" He compared potential lawsuits to frivolous ""hot coffee"" cases and claimed to own only $68 of BDAG digital assets.

◦	Lisa highlighted the lack of transparency, with Block DAG refusing to produce receipts or pay fired employees.

III. Community Response and Action Plan

The speakers outlined their immediate actions and future plans:

•	Legal Action & Wyoming DUNA: Reed announced a $10,000 retainer paid to attorneys to establish a Wyoming DUNA (Decentralized Unincorporated Nonprofit Association). This non-profit legal entity aims to take control of Block DAG's intellectual property and address the alleged mismanagement.

•	Justice for Fired Employees: Lisa emphasized that a top priority is ensuring that approximately $140,000 owed to former Block DAG employees (fired before Christmas/New Year's without pay) is settled, citing a clear breach of contract.

•	Targeting GK: Reed vowed to pursue GK for years of alleged scams (including Big Eyes Coin, Lana Star, Token House) and to target his gambling businesses in Brazil, believing the US government, SEC, and European authorities will take action.

•	Community Unity: Mo urged the community to remain united, ignore misinformation campaigns, and focus on reclaiming the project.

•	Personal Commitment: Reed affirmed his unwavering commitment to the fight, despite his own YouTube channel being taken down by Block DAG on a trademark claim, which he views as an abusive process. He plans more updates, including ""juicy audio,"" in the near future.

•	Saving the Project: The overarching goal for the speakers and the community is to save Block DAG, make it transparent and accountable, and ensure its success for all investors, rather than burning it down.

it has a smart system working with AI to watch me while working, not by camera, but by my behavior (mouse, keyboard, switching tabs…), and it detects when fatigue hits.

it’s so smart and simple, and it handles everything. I just need to work, and it sustains my health.

why it’s so simple:

I just type my task (like writing this reddit post), and AI tells me what type of task it is. for example, the focus mode is a creative one, and it gives the number of suggested sessions. it will increase the number of sessions later if it notices they are not enough, to reach the point where you will not harm yourself by overworking and still complete the task fast.

the fun begins after AI selects the focus mode and number of sessions. the smart system starts watching you and detecting any fatigue or burnout signs. it’s so accurate that when it detects them, it will stop you and notify you to stop right now. and guess what’s next? it gives you relaxation exercises like getting sunlight for 5 minutes, or neck exercises, or just standing up in silence (this is so beneficial instead of doomscrolling or overworking). when you finish those relaxation exercises, you enter the next session… and so on until you finish your task.

surprisingly, I have used it for 3 months. bro, since then I finish all my tasks faster, my health is perfect, bright eyes, good posture, and thank god my hair is strong enough — I didn’t lose it before, and now it’s even better, growing well. no stress, no cortisol during work. I’m using that hormone in a meaningful way, like lifting huge weights…

all of that for the price of a coffee, $5. come on brother, with all these benefits and AI systems, for free? at least to keep things running normally (hosting, AI services…)

if you want to work smarter and not harder like I did in the past, and sustain your health, you can try it by clicking here: [Ytterbium](https://www.ytterbium.life/).

and I swear I’m waiting for your feedback to make it 1000x better and create a better place to work.

my sleep now is better. this is all I wanted.

# Is Sugar-Free Red Bull \*Better\* Than Coffee? Let's Brew on It.

First of all, my husband and I are obsessed with your podcast, and you haven’t lived until you’ve heard a 6’4” 350 lb man match your pitch and scream “Let’s get creeeeppppyyyy!!!”

Anyway, here’s the creepy love story to beat all creepy love stories. My mom and dad were married for 38 years, until my Dad passed away in 2016. To give you an idea of what kinda guy my Dad was, he LOVED his family, and he would protect them AT ALL COSTS. For example, he once beat up my high school principal because I had been suspended from school for something I didn’t even do.

My Dad loved my mom fiercely, and my mom loved my dad equally as much. They were loyal to each other until the very end. A year after my Dad passed away, my mom mentioned to me that many years before she met my Dad, she had a boyfriend that she had loved, who just ghosted her one day, and she felt like she had never gotten closure. She told me they were friends on Facebook, but they never communicated with each other, but that she really wanted to tell him how badly he had hurt her so she could get closure and move on. I encouraged her to do that. I deeply regret that decision. My mom reached out to the guy, call him John, (because that’s his name, he’s dead now, but he still deserves public shame, and you’ll see why). They met for coffee, which turned into an 8 hour long date, and John was basically cemented as a new part of her life. Eventually John moved in with my mom, because he was a bum who had no money, no house, nothing. John made it VERY clear from the beginning that he had no desire to have any relationship with me or my brother. I would visit my mom’s house, and speak to him, and he would completely ignore me. One day, I walked into her house, and every single thing of my Dad’s was gone. I immediately asked my mom where all of my Dad’s things were and she said “John asked me to box everything up. He said he will not live in another man’s shadow.” Funny, because he was living in the house that man had bought and paid for, but I digress. Eventually, my Mom married John. I didn’t even attend the wedding. Things very quickly went from bad to worse, and John became abusive in every way you can imagine. He completely isolated my mom from her entire family, and financially and physically abused her. Things reached a boiling point when I received a call one day that my mom was being taken by ambulance to the hospital. It was determined that she was having seizures, likely due to the stress she was under. I told her enough was enough, and that John had to go.

The next day she was released from the hospital. That night I had a dream. I dreamed I was walking up to my mom’s house, and my Dad was standing on the porch. He smiled and winked at me. He walked up to the door and he held it open for me. I walked in, and as I walked past him, he smiled at me again. In my dream I could feel him, like the way you can feel someone standing next to you. I could smell his scent, (Old Spice mixed with sawdust and a hint of Camel cigarettes). He was real.

The next day, late in the evening, my mom called me. John had left while she was out of the house. No note, just packed up everything he owned (and a lot of what she owned) and left. He took all of the cash out of the safe. I immediately got to work doing whatever I could to protect my mom’s assets. A few days later, I was sitting at her table drinking coffee, and I told her about the dream I had the night before John left. She got a look on her face like she had seen a ghost. She said, “That night, John had gone to bed early. I was in the living room, and all of a sudden John started screaming my name. I went to the bedroom and he kept demanding that I tell him who was in the house. I told him no one. He insisted that someone had just been in the bedroom with him. He kept saying the whole room smelled like cologne and sawdust. I told him no one was there. I had never seen a person so scared. He asked me not to leave him alone, and to come to bed with him. The next day is when he packed up left.”

I am 1000000% convinced that my Dad came to me in my dream that night to show me that he was getting rid of John once and for all. 

About a month after John left, he died. (Good riddance, honestly) I don’t know if he ended up in the same place my Dad is, but if he did, I hope he crosses the street every time he sees my Dad coming. ",1,1769264746.0,creepsandcrimes,0,1.0,False

I'm a developer/researcher mapping digital fatigue and focus distraction in students. Built a diagnostic (vectomind.io/aura) that shows how tools are redlining focus.

Trying to get 100 responses from college campuses to compare focus hygiene against other schools. Small $15 'coffee bounty' for anyone who can help get this onto campus Fizz/Discord for real sample size. Paying out of pocket, so one per school only. This task shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.

Need one NEU student to:

1. Take the diagnostic at [vectomind.io/aura](http://vectomind.io/aura)
2. Post results in your campus Fizz/Discord
3. Send screen recording of both steps

$15 PayPal immediately after verification. DM if interested.",0,1769264540.0,NEU,0,0.5,False

“ i want too hard, i want like it’s the only thing keeping me alive.”

Like a wanderer in a foreign land, I'm searching for a voice that feels like home.... someone jo hindi me baat kar sakta ( pls pls) A connection that understands the unspoken, and a heart that resonates with mine.

In the raw intensity of feelings, I’m the cigarette burning in a cup of coffee.....fragile, fierce, and full of ash‑kissed truths. I break when it gets too quiet, and I scream until my throat tastes like metal, chasing the softness that feels like half finished coffee still warm.
“i’m all apology and ruin and trying again when i shouldn’t. but at least it’s real.”

Love literature (Russians especially lol), love narrating stories over voice notes, love getting lost in conversations about life. I want a love that isn’t rom com bullshit.... a love that makes me pull out my own teeth if asked, that drives me to watch you smoke in silence, and ruins every good thing just to hear my name once more.
“i’ll hold you like the apocalypse already happened and we’re the only bastards left.”

I recently moved here and don’t really have a circle yet. I work in tech, pretty easygoing, and I genuinely enjoy exploring the city. 

I keep seeing cool stuff on Eventbrite; pool parties, piano nights, design/creative events - and honestly, they look amazing… but going alone just isn’t as fun. Weekends hit different when you don’t have a partner-in-crime to share them with.

If you’re someone who enjoys events, chill hangouts, coffee walks, or just checking out something new together, that’d be awesome. No pressure, no weird expectations just good company and good vibes. ✌🏻
