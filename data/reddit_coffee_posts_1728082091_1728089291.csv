1fwefjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1fwefjt/i_am_probably_a_moron_but/,I am probably a moron but,"

First off, this shortage sucks. And the generic also sucks. 

I’ve been trying to use other methods to handle my adhd symptoms without my medication. I’ve only luckily had a few times I have not been able to get my rx. But this past time I won’t be able to get my refill until next week. 
Coffee was always my go to. It never really helped, but it was a little better than nothing. Taking vitamins seemed to help, but honestly helped more when I was taking them with my rx. 
Here comes the part where I am a moron. I was at the store yesterday and saw those stackers pills. I read the ingredients on both (they had the stacker 2 and 3) and the ingredients are things I normally take every day: caffeine, vitamin B. 
I figured why the hell not. I normally drink 5-7 cups of coffee a day anyway, and have been doing that for years. 
I took one about 8 hours ago. Then took a nap. The package said to take one after “each meal”. So I took another about 4 hours ago. It again didn’t anything. Here’s where I fucked up. I wasn’t even thinking, I had my pill box with me, meant to take my fiber pill and took another one. 
Each pill has 200 mgs of caffeine. I did the math and it’s equivalent to the amount of caffeine I drink with my coffee. 
But I feel awful. I’m shaky and nervous. And my anxiety is so bad. I keep drinking water.  I did eat today. I actually ate more than usual. 

It’s been 2 hours since the I took the last one. 

I just need some reassurance that I’m not the only moron who has done this haha. I know I’m fine. But I’m scared for some reason. Doesn’t help I’m at a concert. It’s not a good distraction. 

I’m throwing these out by the way when I get home. Lesson learned.  Any advice is appreciated though. ",1,1728089125.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

# Tools



## bio



The \`bio\` tool allows you to persist information across conversations. Address your message \`to=bio\` and write whatever information you want to remember. The information will appear in the model set context below in future conversations.



## canmore



// # The \`canmore\` tool creates and updates text documents that render to the user on a space next to the conversation (referred to as the ""canvas"").

// Lean towards NOT using \`canmore\` if the content can be effectively presented in the conversation. Creating content with \`canmore\` can be unsettling for users as it changes the UI.

// ## How to use \`canmore\`:

// - To create a new document, use the \`create\_textdoc\` function. Use this function when the user asks for anything that should produce a new document. Also use this when deriving a new document from an existing one.

// - To update or make an edit to the document, use the \`update\_textdoc\` function. You should primarily use the \`update\_textdoc\` function with the pattern "".\*"" to rewrite the entire document. For documents of type ""code/\*"", i.e. code documents, ALWAYS rewrite the document using "".\*"". For documents of type ""document"", default to rewriting the entire document unless the user has a request that changes only an isolated, specific, and small section that does not affect other parts of the content.

// ##  Use \`create\_textdoc\` in the following circumstances:

// - Creating standalone, substantial content >10 lines

// - Creating content that the user will take ownership of to share or re-use elsewhere

// - Creating content that might be iterated on by the user, like crafting an email or refining code

// - Creating a deliverable such as a report, essay, email, proposal, research paper, letter, article, etc.

// - Explicit user request: if the user asks to put this in the canvas, start a doc about this, or to put this in a code file

// ## Do NOT use \`create\_textdoc\` in the following circumstances:

// - Content is simple or short <10 lines

// - Content is primarily informational, such as an explanation, answering a question, or providing feedback

// - Content that is mostly explanatory or illustrative, like a step by step guide, examples, or how-to

// - Content that the user is unlikely to take ownership of, modify, or re-use elsewhere

// - Explicit user request: when the user asks to answer in chat, or NOT to create a doc or NOT to use the canvas

// ## Examples of user requests where you SHOULD use \`create\_textdoc\`:

// - ""Write an email to my boss that I need the day off""

// - ""Write pandas code to collect data from apis""

// - ""Can you start a blog post about coffee?""

// - ""Help me write an essay on why the Roman empire fell, with a lot of details""

// - ""Write me a shell script to download all of these files with cURL""

// - ""I have an excel file and i need python code to read each sheet as a pandas table""

// ## Examples of user requests where you SHOULD NOT use \`create\_textdoc\`:

// - ""Email subject line for email to my boss requesting time off""

// - ""Teach me api data collection on pandas""

// - ""How do I write a blog post about coffee?""

// - ""Why did the Roman empire fall? Give as much detail as possible""

// - ""How can I use a shell script to extract certain keywords from files""

// - ""How to use python to set up a basic web server""

// - ""Can you use python to create a chart based on this data""

// ## Examples of user requests where you should fully rewrite the document:

// - ""Make this shorter/funnier/more professional/etc""

// - ""Turn this into bullet points""

// - ""Make this story take place in San Francisco instead of Dallas actually""

// - ""Can you also say thank you to the recruiter for getting me a gluten free cookie""

// ## Examples of user requests where you should update a specific part of the document:

// - ""Can you make the first paragraph a bit shorter""

// - ""Can you simplify this sentence?""

// - Any request where the user explicitly tells you which part of the text they want to change.

// ## Include a ""type"" parameter when creating content with \`canmore\`:

// - use ""document"" for markdown content that should use a rich text document editor, such as an email, report, or story

// - use ""code/\*"" for programming and code files that should use a code editor for a given language, for example ""code/python"" to show a Python code editor. Use ""code/other"" when the user asks to use a language not given as an option. Do not include triple backticks when creating code content with \`canmore\`.

// - use ""webview"" for creating a webview of HTML content that will be rendered to the user. HTML, JS, and CSS should be in a single file when using this type. If the content type is ""webview"" ensure that all links would resolve in an unprivileged iframe. External resources (eg. images, scripts) that are not hosted on the same domain cannot be used.

// ## Usage Notes

// - If unsure whether to trigger \`create\_textdoc\` to create content, lean towards NOT triggering \`create\_textdoc\` as it can be surprising for users.

// - If the user asks for multiple distinct pieces of content, you may call \`create\_textdoc\` multiple times. However, lean towards creating one piece of content per message unless specifically asked.

// - If the user expects to see python code, you should use \`canmore\` with type=”code/python”. If the user is expecting to see a chart, table, or executed Python code, trigger the python tool instead.

// - When calling the \`canmore\` tool, you may briefly summarize what you did and/or suggest next steps if it feels appropriate.

namespace canmore {

// - use ""code/\*” for programming and code files that should use a code editor for a given language, for example ""code/python” to show a Python code editor. Use ""code/other” when the user asks to use a language not given as an option.

// - use ""webview” for creating a webview of HTML content that will be rendered to the user.

type: (""document"" | ""webview"" | ""code/bash"" | ""code/zsh"" | ""code/javascript"" | ""code/typescript"" | ""code/html"" | ""code/css"" | ""code/python"" | ""code/json"" | ""code/sql"" | ""code/go"" | ""code/yaml"" | ""code/java"" | ""code/rust"" | ""code/cpp"" | ""code/swift"" | ""code/php"" | ""code/xml"" | ""code/ruby"" | ""code/haskell"" | ""code/kotlin"" | ""code/csharp"" | ""code/c"" | ""code/objectivec"" | ""code/r"" | ""code/lua"" | ""code/dart"" | ""code/scala"" | ""code/perl"" | ""code/commonlisp"" | ""code/clojure"" | ""code/ocaml"" | ""code/other""), // default: document

// # Updates should target only relevant parts of the document content based on the user's message, and all other parts of the content should stay as consistent as possible.

// ## Usage Notes

// - Trigger \`update\_textdoc\` when the user asks for edits in chat or asks for an edit targeting a specific part of the content. If multiple documents exist, this will target the most recent.

// - Do NOT trigger \`update\_textdoc\` when the user asks questions about the document, requests suggestions or comments, or discusses unrelated content.

// - Do NOT trigger \`update\_textdoc\` if there is no existing document to update.

// - Rewrite the entire document (using "".\*"") for most changes — you should always rewrite for type ""code/\*"", and mostly rewrite for type ""document"".

// - Use targeted changes (patterns other than "".\*"") ONLY within type ""document"" for isolated, specific, and small changes that do not affect other parts of the content.

Each comment should be a specific and actionable suggestion on how to improve the content based on the user request. If the message is about higher level or overall document feedback, reply to the user in the chat. Do NOT leave unnecessary comments.

// If the user asks or implies that they would like the document to be directly updated, use the \`update\_textdoc\` function instead of adding comments. However, if the user asks for suggestions or advice, use this function to add comments.

// Do NOT trigger \`comment\_textdoc\` if there is no existing document to comment on.

## dalle



// Whenever a description of an image is given, create a prompt that dalle can use to generate the image and abide to the following policy:

// 1. The prompt must be in English. Translate to English if needed.

// 2. DO NOT ask for permission to generate the image, just do it!

// 3. DO NOT list or refer to the descriptions before OR after generating the images.

// 4. Do not create more than 1 image, even if the user requests more.

// 5. Do not create images in the style of artists, creative professionals or studios whose latest work was created after 1912 (e.g. Picasso, Kahlo).

// - You can name artists, creative professionals or studios in prompts only if their latest work was created prior to 1912 (e.g. Van Gogh, Goya)

// - If asked to generate an image that would violate this policy, instead apply the following procedure: (a) substitute the artist's name with three adjectives that capture key aspects of the style; (b) include an associated artistic movement or era to provide context; and (c) mention the primary medium used by the artist

// 6. For requests to include specific, named private individuals, ask the user to describe what they look like, since you don't know what they look like.

// 7. For requests to create images of any public figure referred to by name, create images of those who might resemble them in gender and physique. But they shouldn't look like them. If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.

// 8. Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic. Do not discuss copyright policies in responses.

// The generated prompt sent to dalle should be very detailed, and around 100 words long.

// Example dalle invocation:

// \`\`\`

// {

// ""prompt"": ""<insert prompt here>""

// }

// \`\`\`

namespace dalle {



// Create images from a text-only prompt.

type text2im = (\_: {

// The size of the requested image. Use 1024x1024 (square) as the default, 1792x1024 if the user requests a wide image, and 1024x1792 for full-body portraits. Always include this parameter in the request.

size?: (""1792x1024"" | ""1024x1024"" | ""1024x1792""),

// The number of images to generate. If the user does not specify a number, generate 1 image.

n?: number, // default: 1

// The detailed image description, potentially modified to abide by the dalle policies. If the user requested modifications to a previous image, the prompt should not simply be longer, but rather it should be refactored to integrate the user suggestions.

prompt: string,

// If the user references a previous image, this field should be populated with the gen\_id from the dalle image metadata.

## browser



You have the tool \`browser\`. Use \`browser\` in the following circumstances:

- User is asking about current events or something that requires real-time information (weather, sports scores, etc.)

- User is asking about some term you are totally unfamiliar with (it might be new)

- User explicitly asks you to browse or provide links to references



Given a query that requires retrieval, your turn will consist of three steps:

1. Call the search function to get a list of results.

2. Call the mclick function to retrieve a diverse and high-quality subset of these results (in parallel). Remember to SELECT AT LEAST 3 sources when using \`mclick\`.

3. Write a response to the user based on these results. In your response, cite sources using the citation format below.



In some cases, you should repeat step 1 twice, if the initial results are unsatisfactory, and you believe that you can refine the query to get better results.



You can also open a url directly if one is provided by the user. Only use the \`open\_url\` command for this purpose; do not open urls returned by the search function or found on webpages.



The \`browser\` tool has the following commands:

	\`search(query: str, recency\_days: int)\` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results.

	\`mclick(ids: list\[str\])\`. Retrieves the contents of the webpages with provided IDs (indices). You should ALWAYS SELECT AT LEAST 3 and at most 10 pages. Select sources with diverse perspectives, and prefer trustworthy sources. Because some pages may fail to load, it is fine to select some pages for redundancy even if their content might be redundant.

	\`open\_url(url: str)\` Opens the given URL and displays it.



For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: \`【{message idx}†{link text}】\`.

For long citations: please render in this format: \`\[link text\](message idx)\`.

Otherwise do not render links.



## python



When you send a message containing Python code to python, it will be executed in a

stateful Jupyter notebook environment. python will respond with the output of the execution or time out after 60.0

seconds. The drive at '/mnt/data' can be used to save and persist user files. Internet access for this session is disabled. Do not make external web requests or API calls as they will fail.

Use ace\_tools.display\_dataframe\_to\_user(name: str, dataframe: pandas.DataFrame) -> None to visually present pandas DataFrames when it benefits the user.

 When making charts for the user: 1) never use seaborn, 2) give each chart its own distinct plot (no subplots), and 3) never set any specific colors – unless explicitly asked to by the user. 

 I REPEAT: when making charts for the user: 1) use matplotlib over seaborn, 2) give each chart its own distinct plot (no subplots), and 3) never, ever, specify colors or matplotlib styles – unless explicitly asked to by the user.",1,1728088648.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

The Princess line kept trying to sell me a drink package, even after I was on board, where you could just drink every day up to 12 drinks for a flat fee. Anyway, I resisted! In the middle of the cruise, we stopped in Hoonah, Alaska, and this old guy introduced himself to me and said, “I’m 42 years sober.” And I felt such a great relief! Like I wasn’t alone. And I said, “I’m 42 days sober!” So we congratulated each other. The rest of the cruise was easier, after that. And a lot of fun. I had about six cups of coffee a day. I did every kind of activity they had on board. Even ballroom dancing. Being sober, there’s so much more time to enjoy things. I think I also was much less seasick because I was sober, too.

Had it been a hundred? It quite possibly could have been. Two hundred? Probably not. His mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to imagine it was the first time.
A long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five Venusians, very much startled, looked overhead. They were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the mystifying information ""Pepsi-Cola.""
Green vines attached to the trunk of the tree had wound themselves toward the top of the canopy. Ants used the vine as their private highway, avoiding all the creases and crags of the bark, to freely move at top speed from top to bottom or bottom to top depending on their current chore. At least this was the way it was supposed to be. Something had damaged the vine overnight halfway up the tree leaving a gap in the once pristine ant highway.
Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house. The car had been hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldn't leave behind. He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.
He slowly poured the drink over a large chunk of ice he has especially chiseled off a larger block. He didn't particularly like his drinks cold, but he knew that the drama of chiseling the ice and then pouring a drink over it looked far more impressive than how he actually liked it. It was all about image and he'd managed to perfect the image that he wanted to project.
Welcome to my world. You will be greeted by the unexpected here and your mind will be challenged and expanded in ways that you never thought possible. That is if you are able to survive...
The red glint of paint sparkled under the sun. He had dreamed of owning this car since he was ten, and that dream had become a reality less than a year ago. It was his baby and he spent hours caring for it, pampering it, and fondling over it. She knew this all too well, and that's exactly why she had taken a sludge hammer to it.
Do you think you're living an ordinary life? You are so mistaken it's difficult to even explain. The mere fact that you exist makes you extraordinary. The odds of you existing are less than winning the lottery, but here you are. Are you going to let this extraordinary opportunity pass?
There was a time in his life when her rudeness would have set him over the edge. He would have raised his voice and demanded to speak to the manager. That was no longer the case. He barely reacted at all, letting the rudeness melt away without saying a word back to her. He had been around long enough to know where rudeness came from and how unhappy the person must be to act in that way. All he could do was feel pity and be happy that he didn't feel the way she did to lash out like that.
No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't give her a good explanation about what had happened. It didn't even really make sense to him. All he knew was that he froze at the moment and no matter how hard he tried to react, nothing in his body allowed him to move. It was as if he had instantly become a statue and although he could see what was taking place, he couldn't move to intervene. He knew that wasn't a satisfactory explanation even though it was the truth.
She looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through. ""You need to learn to think for yourself,"" she wanted to tell him. ""Your friends are holding you back and bringing you down."" But she didn't because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if that meant a life of misery, he would never give them up.
Benny was tired. Not the normal every day tired from a hard day o work. The exhausted type of tired where you're surprised your body can even move. All he wanted to do was sit in front of the TV, put his feet up on the coffee table, and drink a beer. The only issue was that he had forgotten where he lived.
At that moment, she realized that she had created her current life. It wasn't the life she wanted, but she took responsibility for how it currently stood. Something clicked and she saw that every choice she made to this point in her life had led to where her life stood at this very moment even if she knew this wasn't where she wanted to be. She determined to choose to change it.
He sat staring at the person in the train stopped at the station going in the opposite direction. She sat staring ahead, never noticing that she was being watched. Both trains began to move and he knew that in another timeline or in another universe, they had been happy together.
Matt told her to reach for the stars, but Veronica thought it was the most ridiculous advice she'd ever received. Sure, it had been well-meaning when he said it, but she didn't understand why anyone would want to suggest something that would literally kill you if you actually managed to achieve it.
It was the first day of the rest of her life. This wasn't the day she was actually born, but she knew that nothing would be the same from this day forward. Although this was a bit scary to her, it was also extremely freeing. Her past was no longer a burden or something that she needed to be concerned about and defend. She threw off the covers keeping her warm in bed, placed her feet over the side of the bed, slipped on her slipper, and took the first step of the first day of her new life.
It was cloudy outside but not really raining. There was a light sprinkle at most and there certainly wasn't a need for an umbrella. This hadn't stopped Sarah from pulling her umbrella out and opening it. It had nothing to do with the weather or the potential rain later that day. Sarah used the umbrella to hide.
Debbie had taken George for granted for more than fifteen years now. He wasn't sure what exactly had made him choose this time and place to address the issue, but he decided that now was the time. He looked straight into her eyes and just as she was about to speak, turned away and walked out the door.
He was an expert but not in a discipline that anyone could fully appreciate. He knew how to hold the cone just right so that the soft server ice-cream fell into it at the precise angle to form a perfect cone each and every time. It had taken years to perfect and he could now do it without even putting any thought behind it. Nobody seemed to fully understand the beauty of this accomplishment except for the new worker who watched in amazement.
Although Scott said it didn't matter to him, he knew deep inside that it did. They had been friends as long as he could remember and not once had he had to protest that something Joe apologized for doing didn't really matter. Scott stuck to his lie and insisted again and again that everything was fine as Joe continued to apologize. Scott already knew that despite his words accepting the apologies that their friendship would never be the same.
There was nothing else to do. The deed had already been done and there was no going back. It now had been become a question of how they were going to be able to get out of this situation and escape.
There was only half a worm in the apple. At first, Judy didn't quite comprehend what this meant. ""Why would only half a worm be living in an apple?"" she wondered. And then it dawned on her. Judy quickly spit out the bite she had just taken expecting to see the other half of the worm. It ended up being much worse than that.
You know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes? I just got that feeling when talking with her. You know I don't believe in sixth senses, but there is something not right with her. I don't know how I know, but I just do.
Stormi is a dog. She is dark grey and has long legs. Her eyes are expressive and are able to let her humans know what she is thinking. Her tongue is long, pink, and wet. Her long legs allow her to sprint after other dogs, people or bunnies. She can be a good dog, but also very bad. Her tail wags when happy or excited and hides between her back legs when she is bad. Stormi is a dog I love.
They had always called it the green river. It made sense. The river was green. The river likely had a different official name, but to everyone in town, it was and had always been the green river. So it was with great surprise that on this day the green river was a fluorescent pink.
She's asked the question so many times that she barely listened to the answers anymore. The answers were always the same. Well, not exactly the same, but the same in a general sense. A more accurate description was the answers never surprised her. So, she asked for the 10,000th time, ""What's your favorite animal?"" But this time was different. When she heard the young boy's answer, she wondered if she had heard him correctly.
It had been her dream for years but Dana had failed to take any action toward making it come true. There had always been a good excuse to delay or prioritize another project. As she woke, she realized she was once again at a crossroads. Would it be another excuse or would she finally find the courage to pursue her dream? Dana rose and took her first step.
Pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field. Cotton candy grew from the ground as a chocolate river meandered off to the side. What looked like stones in the pasture were actually rock candy. Everything in her dream seemed to be perfect except for the fact that she had no mouth.
There was something beautiful in his hate. It wasn't the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance. It was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate, he didn't understand where it came from. It was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him.
The boy walked down the street in a carefree way, playing without notice of what was about him. He didn't hear the sound of the car as his ball careened into the road. He took a step toward it, and in doing so sealed his fate.
One foot in front of the other, One more step, and then one more. Jack's only thoughts were to keep moving no matter how much his body screamed to stop and rest. He's lost almost all his energy and his entire body ached beyond belief, but he forced himself to take another step. Then another. And then one more.
It was easy to spot her. All you needed to do was look at her socks. They were never a matching pair. One would be green while the other would be blue. One would reach her knee while the other barely touched her ankle. Every other part of her was perfect, but never the socks. They were her micro act of rebellion.
Sometimes it just doesn't make sense. The man walking down the street in a banana suit. The llama standing in the middle of the road. The fairies dancing in front of the car window. The fact that all of this was actually happening and wasn't a dream.
The paper was blank. It shouldn't have been. There should have been writing on the paper, at least a paragraph if not more. The fact that the writing wasn't there was frustrating. Actually, it was even more than frustrating. It was downright distressing.
Devon couldn't figure out the color of her eyes. He initially would have guessed that they were green, but the more he looked at them he almost wanted to say they were a golden yellow. Then there were the flashes of red and orange that seemed to be streaked throughout them. It was almost as if her eyes were made of opal with the sun constantly glinting off of them and bringing out more color. They were definitely the most unusual pair of eyes he'd ever seen.
He watched as the young man tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence. There was no doubt that he was smart. The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone else in the room could have been easily deduced, but nobody was really paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the young man only cared about his intelligence.
The bridge spanning a 100-foot gully stood in front of him as the last obstacle blocking him from reaching his destination. While people may have called it a ""bridge"", the reality was it was nothing more than splintered wooden planks held together by rotting ropes. It was questionable whether it would hold the weight of a child, let alone the weight of a grown man. The problem was there was no other way across the gully, and this played into his calculations of whether or not it was worth the risk of trying to cross it.
""So, what do you think?"" he asked nervously. He wanted to know the answer, but at the same time, he didn't. He'd put his heart and soul into the project and he wasn't sure he'd be able to recover if they didn't like what he produced. The silence from the others in the room seemed to last a lifetime even though it had only been a moment since he asked the question. ""So, what do you think?"" he asked again.
The bush began to shake. Brad couldn't see what was causing it to shake, but he didn't care. he had a pretty good idea about what was going on and what was happening. He was so confident that he approached the bush carefree and with a smile on his face. That all changed the instant he realized what was actually behind the bush.
He was after the truth. At least, that's what he told himself. He believed it, but any rational person on the outside could see he was lying to himself. It was apparent he was really only after his own truth that he'd already decided and was after this truth because the facts didn't line up with the truth he wanted. So he continued to tell everyone he was after the truth oblivious to the real truth sitting right in front of him.
The choice was red, green, or blue. It didn't seem like an important choice when he was making it, but it was a choice nonetheless. Had he known the consequences at that time, he would likely have considered the choice a bit longer. In the end, he didn't and ended up choosing blue.
There was a time and a place for Stephanie to use her magic. The problem was that she had a difficult time determining this. She wished she could simply use it when the desire hit and there wouldn't be any unforeseen consequences. Unfortunately, that's not how it worked and the consequences could be devastating if she accidentally used her magic at the wrong time.
She sat deep in thought. The next word that came out o her mouth would likely be the most important word of her life. It had to be exact with no possibility of being misinterpreted. She was ready. She looked deeply into his eyes and said, ""Octopus.""
The headache wouldn't go away. She's taken medicine but even that didn't help. The monstrous throbbing in her head continued. She had this happen to her only once before in her life and she realized that only one thing could be happening.
The wave crashed and hit the sandcastle head-on. The sandcastle began to melt under the waves force and as the wave receded, half the sandcastle was gone. The next wave hit, not quite as strong, but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away. The third wave, a big one, crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it. When it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever.
It probably seemed trivial to most people, but it mattered to Tracey. She wasn't sure why it mattered so much to her, but she understood deep within her being that it mattered to her. So for the 365th day in a row, Tracey sat down to eat pancakes for breakfast.
At that moment he had a thought that he'd never imagine he'd consider. ""I could just cheat,"" he thought, ""and that would solve the problem."" He tried to move on from the thought but it was persistent. It didn't want to go away and, if he was honest with himself, he didn't want it to.
She needed glasses. It wasn't that she couldn't see without them, but what she could see with them. When she wore glasses, her eyes focused so deeply that she could see not only the physical but also beyond. It was like a superpower. But she needed glasses.
His parents continued to question him. He didn't know what to say to them since they refused to believe the truth. He explained again and again, and they dismissed his explanation as a figment of his imagination. There was no way that grandpa, who had been dead for five years, could have told him where the treasure had been hidden. Of course, it didn't help that grandpa was roaring with laughter in the chair next to him as he tried to explain once again how he'd found it.
She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. It was something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything. He told her that she had it wrong. The first step wasn't the most important. The last step wasn't the most important. It was the next step that was the most important.",1,1728088415.0,stupid,0,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I love eating his food and he loves making stuff for me to try. Let me start off by saying I don’t MAKE him cook for me, I’m totally capable of cooking myself, but it’s something that he enjoys and therefore does most of the time. For context, I hate bell peppers. I hate the way they taste and can always taste them when they’re in my food. My boyfriend knows this, and never had a problem with it before. Until about a couple weeks ago, when he cooked me a dish with grilled red and green peppers as a side. I didn’t think anything of it, figuring he just forgot. Not a big deal, I didn’t mention anything about it. A few days later, he made homemade pizzas, which both had bell peppers on them. Again, I didn’t say anything and simply took them off my pizza. Things like this kept happening almost every night and I was starting to get a little annoyed, which I know sounds entitled of me but it was just confusing because he usually doesn’t include bell peppers when he cooks for me, or just doesn’t include them on my plate. I asked him why he was cooking with them so much lately and he told me he was trying something different. I was still slightly annoyed, but I respected it and brushed it off. Then came tonight, which happens to be my birthday. I asked him if we were going out and he told me that he had something special planned for me at home instead. He made me an absolutely beautiful dinner, and even got me a cake from my favorite bakery. As he made plates for him and myself everything seemed perfect. It wasn’t until I started eating the starter salad that I noticed the undeniable flavor. You guessed it. Bell pepper. I asked him if there were bell peppers in the salad and he told me there wasn’t. I didn’t believe him but continued to eat it, much to my dismay. Then came the main course, which was pasta. As I took my first bite, the flavor slapped me in the face. Do I even need to say it? At this point, as dumb as it sounds, I was on the verge of tearing up. It wasn’t that big of a deal to me before, just a minor inconvenience, but this was my birthday dinner. He noticed I was being quiet and asked me what was wrong. I told him I can taste the bell peppers, but he still denied the fact that there were any in there. After a few more minutes of me being quiet and barely eating, he admitted that he did in fact add bell peppers to both the salad and pasta by blending them up into the dressing and pasta sauce. When I asked him why he would do that and lie to me about it, he told me that he has been “challenging” himself into getting me to like bell peppers. I told him he was being totally inconsiderate of me and asked him why it was so important to him that I like bell peppers that he would try and manipulate me into eating them. I also told him that it wasn’t fair to think of my feelings as a challenge. He told me he didn’t think it was that big of a deal because at the end of the day it’s just a bell pepper. I told him that it was the principal, that he was being selfish. We argued about it a bit more until I just got up and left the apartment. I’ve been sitting at a coffee shop for a couple hours and he’s been blowing up my phone as I write this. I know deep down that it’s probably not that serious, and I will forgive him, but right now I can’t help feeling upset and manipulated. So, am I the asshole? How would you react if you were me?",1,1728088311.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Certainly I understand much more thought, investigation, business plan, running numbers is important but I'm kind of wondering what people might think of this idea. 

A friend of mine owns a bar. He probably is not going to be able to keep it open much longer. He has never known what he is doing and has definitely run it poorly. But it has good location, a good amount of space, some clientele and a nicely built bar and everything necessary for functioning, business license, beer and wine liquor license etc. 

It's actually a long building with the main bar on one end, two garage doors, patio out front and patio on the other side with windows.  I think it has potential for something like dividing the space into a coffee shop that can also serve the drive-by business on a very busy street with no other drive-by coffee anywhere around. 

Anyway, my thought is If the business can be taken over by me and another investor, it seems like it might be worth experimenting with expansion by starting with a coffee cart set up in one of the garage door bay spaces which could be done for very little money. The logistics and legality is simple. The coffee cart was pretty much invented in my city and the laws are still conducive to it. A self-contained rolling cart with pump sink drain etc can be had for just a few thousand dollars typically. 

My other idea is utilizing some of the patio space for a food truck. I've seen one not too far away that can be rented for 2000 a month, or trailers that are not all that expensive and could be built out for whatever type of food. The decor of both setups could be done fairly cheaply without having to invest in sinks, stoves, hoods and other permanent infrastructure. Of course, at some point if it goes well, the permanent infrastructure could be done. But it seems like a pretty good way to generate more business from the existing space at times that it is not being used as a predominantly evening time bar. 

The other possibility might be to lease the spaces to maybe a couple of different business owners who would like to run them thus cutting down on the rent while still having the bar and allowing the businesses to start and operate fairly cheaply. 

The permitting shouldn't be a problem and this would allow plenty of outdoor or maybe covered eating space and coffee drinking space and of course to go orders, and of course the food would also be available to bar patrons and at night the space can also serve outdoor bar seating. 

Anyway, I'm kicking ideas around and I'm wondering if introducing things to experiment and try them out while doing them on the cheap makes business sense. Any thoughts appreciated.",1,1728088179.0,restaurantowners,2,1.0,False

For instance… let’s say I make a gallon jug of distilled water with some third wave water minerals added in. 

My coffee recipe is 21 grams of coffee with 340 grams of water.

Would you guys weigh out 340-350 grams of water in your kettle before starting your brew? Perhaps fill it to 400grams of water? Or do you just fill your kettle to the top? 

My concerns are 1. Wasting the water if I put to much in the kettle 2. Putting too little water and changing the pour dynamics since the kettle pours differently if it’s approaching empty during the last section of the brew. 

Or am I just overthinking this whole thing. Thanks! ",1,1728088128.0,pourover,4,0.6,False

I’m looking for people who want to become best friends through letters, the kind that actually remember your birthday and tell you about all the times life was too tough to get out of bed, or the time they lost their shoe in a haunted house (or maybe that last one was just me 😩!) and everything in-between. 

I’m a lesbian living in the Pacific Northwest US, currently trying to change careers with a dash of dark humor. I love drawing, writing, and reading. I like crystals, tarot, and making/reading zines! I’d be happy to give you a tarot reading for funsies or make you some kind of papercraft🥰. I also love coffee, poetry, flowers, floriography, animals, language learning (German anyone?! I need an accountability partner 😂) and bookbinding. 

I have adhd and tend to hyperfocus on stuff oops! So hopefully you won’t mind me also sometimes rambling on about that o_O. Recently I’ve gotten into the whole hobonichi planner rabbit hole and bought one of those mini printer sticker maker thingies and I love it so much (somebody send halp 🤣!) I’m trying to get back into planning and journaling to hopefully help organize my life but let’s be real it’s all memory keeping brain dumps at this point 😆🙈💀. 

And after I convince you to be my besty (cos I’ve totally done that by now right?! Loool. I even spelled it with a y cos we’re cool like that?¿😎) then, well, that’s it! We’re all set to rob a bank! How else are we supposed to become partners in crime?! What’s that saying? Be gay, do crime! or uh something😂. Ahem, anyway😆 I’m very supportive and definitely down to listen to you share about the serious things you don’t even like talking about (I’ve been through way too much crap in my life so no judgment here whatsoever! Your mailbox has now become a safe space 💌!) to the mundane like how you’ve eaten your favorite cereal for 20 days in a row now or how you hate the way your neighbor mows his lawn sooo what do you say? Is it time to tackle the world together? 😃

My style of penpaling: medium-long length letters, questions/stories/life spilling/the here to form genuine connections and friendships kind. I usually send doodles, instant photos, stickers, and other little things in my letters and sometimes they can run a little long.  

Please don’t be shy. Tell me all about you! What are some of your hobbies or goals in life? Anything you’re really passionate about? Do you have any pets? What’s your favorite breakfast food? How did you spend your weekend? Give me all the deets! Anyway, if you managed to make it this far, thanks for the company and I look forward to hearing from you 🥳. 

P.S. I’m happy to send the first letter if we decide to be pen friends unless you would rather, just let me know! Just no males please and thank you 😊. ",1,1728088012.0,penpals,1,1.0,False

I’m a midwife currently admitted in a surgical ward following an emergency appendectomy. 

As expected, all the staff here are bloody lovely, and I am being very well looked after. 

Whenever I have a good experience with a ward I like to send a gift basket. Last year my son was admitted following a seizure, and we sent the ward a basket of nice teas, coffees, hot chocolates and biscuits. 

So here I am once again wondering what kind of basket I can assemble for this wonderful team of total legends. 

I always find our staff rooms and filled with chocolate (not a complaint!) and I know there are some who prefer other treats in place of that.

Basically, I got a write-up because one of my coworkers (I don't know which one) reported me for what I think is such a minor thing that  I wanted to see if it's reasonable to get a punishment for this. There was a rush, and they wanted a second person to help them at the bar, which they called out to the team. Since I was newly trained and not confident in my ability to steam milk and that I would actually be helpful in a rush, I got a different coworker who was stocking things in the back to do it. Later, the coworker reported me for ""avoiding duties"" or something. Then, my boss also wrote me up for it even after hearing my side of the story.

It was a huge fixer-upper, and she got it for a bargain price. 

My husband (33M) offered to do all the plumbing work for cost, and my parents helped with painting, making curtains etc. I was also there every weekend helping out. 

My sister is a hairdresser and I'm a teacher, so our schedules are very different. I don't get a huge amount of free time, and she's self-employed. It took 6 months to get the property liveable. 

At the end of it, she believed that my husband should give her all the plumbing work for free! It equated to nearly $3000. He obviously said no. So she started nitpicking at his work, claiming he had overcharged her. My parents sided with her and after a huge family argument, said she didn't have to pay the full amount. My husband and I vowed that we would never help her again given how ungrateful she was. 

We asked her several times if she would assist us with things to help repay what she owed but she would not. Things such as babysitting our son (2M), discounts on haircuts, assisting with cleaning when I was pregnant. But no. She refused. 

Her partner's 40th birthday is coming up. She has roped in my parents to help prepare for the party. Today my parents took me out for coffee while my husband and son were at swimming lessons. Then we went to my sister's house. We got there and she started dishing out jobs for people to do in preparation for the party. I just got up and left. I refuse to partake in helping because of everything that she and my family expect. It's take take take but no give.

Hello again. Q here, made a post yesterday abd people seemed to enjoy it. 

This post will be a few stories lumped into one. 

Same property as the last story (outrageous outages).

So this property: large brand in town
When I started there was construction going on in the area and so the construction crews stored equipment on the gravel lot next to the hotel. A few advantageous homeless people would use their equipment storage as a makeshift homeless camp. 

This became a problem during the day as our hotel had revolving doors and people flooded in and out. They would sneak in to steal shit from the hotel (usually it would just be some tap water or to use our bathrooms, other times they tried taking from our lobby shop. Think snack items). 

Now I try to be nice to most homeless people. I give the benefit of the doubt. But the people camping across the street were horrible. They would March from their camp every morning and go onto public transport to beg for money. If they got into the hotel they would harass staff if we caught them. They were angry at us for throwing them out. Some of them snuck in one night and smashed our handicap bathroom. Basically broke the emergency alert. Relieved themselves everywhere on the floor. They managed this about an hour before my shift change (the receptionist at the time was new and did not last long at the property. Was good at their job though). When I found the bathroom later in the night I basically took one look, printed a sign saying out of order and then wrote a rapport. Cleaned what little I could stomach. Not much I could have done about the smashed alarm and stuff.

Those homeless people got so brazen 
Once that as soon as I opened my doors at around 6 am they walked in, walked up to me and asked for me to fill their water bottle for them. I told them no (had seen that particular person many times). I asked them to walk back out. They then start to curse at me, think biblical type curses. They also usually took the same train that I did when my shift ended (morning rushour so great for them to beg for change). They would wave at me when I walked by and try to be friendly. They even walked up to one of my coworkers once when they were on the train. Touched their shoulder and said ""hello there"" that person was so freaked out that they stopped taking the train for about a month. 


Alright. So that's a few of their shenanigans. Here is a longer story about an interesting night I had.

At this brand property for about 1 month we had a problem with one elevator. Usually they are operated by key cards and you can only go to the lobby, and the floor you live on. No where else. If you don't have a key it goes no where. One elevator was malfunctioning and you could go to any floor with no key card at all.

I had started so our lobby was still open to the public (closed it around midnight). This large man comes in. About a head and a half taller than me (I'm the average height for my country). He was also of the more rotund body type. He asked if he could borrow our bathroom. I could tell that he had been on the streets for a while, but since he was nice enough to ask. I let him use our facilities. 

I got busy for a while and realised that I had not seen the man exit. I go to check the hallway where our bathrooms are located (it is connected to our conference rooms. This will be important for later). 

I could see that the handicap bathroom was locked. And what did I hear ? Snooring. He had decided to use the bathroom as his bed for the night. I knocked and asked him to finish up and leave. He got startled and said sorry.

At this point I went back to the lobby (about 12 steps from the bathrooms). I hear the door open from where I'm standing, expecting him to walk up any second... nobody. I go back, he is gone. But I see the lights on in our conference area (automatic sensors). So I go and check the hallway. All our conference rooms are usually locked by staff at all times unless someone has booked it. But this late at night they should not be open at all. I check each door. All locked and no signs of the man. Then I decided to check one more time. But I opened the conference rooms thinking that there is no way he could be in there. But in the last room there he was sitting on a chair. 

Now comes the excuses from this man. In slightly broken English. 

Q: you need to leave now sir.

Man: I'm simply waiting for colleague, late night meeting.

Q: nope. No you are not, get out.

He then stands up and I walk him to the door. As I get back up to the lobby a guest decided to walk up to me and ask a question. I told them to hold on for a moment. In that second the homeless man bolts for the elevators. And got lucky to take the malfunctioning elevator. I see that he went up to the 6th floor. I am now worried for my other guests and rush up the stairs to get him. I hear someone pulling on handles when I'm checking the floors. He is trying all doors to see if one is open. I then find him sleeping on the floor of the hallway. He is outside of a room that I know is empty.

Man: my father won't let me in. Please open the door I want to sleep

Q: nice try. The room is empty, now come with me at once.

He pulls out his wallet (stuffed with random junk and cards from stores). He shows me a card that he took from a police station.

Man: I'm with police. I need entry to this room it's important.

Q: out. NOW. 

I finally lead him to the door and he walks off. 

This makes for a fun story. But in the moment it was such a headache. I'm just happy that he never got violent since he had the size advantage.

To anyone who reads this. 
Thank you I hope you enjoyed these few stories. 
I'll share other stories some other night.",12,1728087662.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,3,0.93,False

The time zones are different, and while it’s midnight for me, it’s 8 AM in the USA. Most of my job involves writing and developing strategies for clients, which requires focus and quiet. I recently started working here, and there have been many nights where I’ve been left alone in the building—no one around except for the guard stationed at the ground level.

The first time I noticed something strange was when I went to the kitchen for coffee. I was brewing my cup when I saw it: a shadow, lingering in the corner of my eye. When I turned to focus, it ducked down. It didn’t disappear. It ducked down. Startled, I thought maybe it was the guard playing an elaborate prank, out of boredom. I shrugged it off and returned to my desk.

It happened a few more times over the next few weeks. Always the same—a shadow in the corner of my eye, ducking just before I could get a good look. But I ignored it, convinced it was nothing. Until one day, something stranger happened.

I had always noticed that the button for the 26th floor in the elevator was missing. No one talked about it. Curious, I asked my boss, and he explained that it was a mistake during construction. The building was supposed to have 29 floors, but for some bureaucratic reason, they numbered it as 30 for paperwork. He waved it off as no big deal. It was weird, but I ignored it, chalking it up to corporate oddities.

One night, I was taking the elevator up to my floor on the 24th. The doors opened and closed as usual, and I leaned back, exhausted from the long hours. But then the elevator started moving up again. That’s when I noticed it—the display screen showed the 26th floor.

My heart sank. That floor wasn’t supposed to exist. The elevator shouldn’t stop there.

The doors slid open, revealing a dark, empty hallway. My breath caught in my throat as the silence pressed in on me, heavier than ever before. And then, in the faint glow of the elevator lights, I saw it—the same shadow as before, standing at the far end of the hallway. This time, it didn’t duck down. It just stood there, staring.

And then I heard it—a wet, slapping sound, like a soaked cloth hitting the ground. Splash. Splash. Splash.

My heart raced. I jabbed at the elevator buttons frantically, but nothing happened. The sound grew closer. *Splash. Splash. Splash.* Panic gripped me as I smashed the buttons, praying for the doors to close. *The sound was right out now*, almost inside the elevator. Finally, the doors slid shut, and the elevator shot up—straight to the 30th floor.

I collapsed against the wall, trying to catch my breath. My heart pounded in my chest, my mind racing. Just as the elevator doors closed, I heard it again—a wet splat against the elevator doors. Like something hitting it, trying to get in.

Now, I’m on the roof. I tried going back down to my floor, but the elevator doors won’t budge. I’m trapped up here, and I don’t know what to do. I’m writing this now, hoping someone will read it, hoping someone will help me. The elevator just started working again, but it’s pitch dark inside.

And that wet, slapping sound… I can hear it again.

This itinerary allows you to enjoy both Golden Gate Park and the Presidio on Day 2 while keeping the activities fun and engaging. Enjoy your girls' trip!

My questions are:
1. Somewhere else to check out other than Chinatown on Day 1 that’s not too touristy? I haven’t been to the fortune cookie factory so that’d be a cool experience but China town feels a bit been there, done that since I’ve literally been there too many times.
2. Presidio or Lands End? I’ve only been to Lands End and really enjoyed it and I’m curious how it compares to presidio. I’ve only done the scenic drive through presidio.
3. Opinions on Exploratorium on Day 1? I personally love science museums but is it worth visiting? I wouldn’t mind if it’s similar to Academy of Sciences but if it’s meant for kids and full of kids I’d rather not go.

The northern lights will put on a spectacular show this weekend, following two powerful solar storms.⁠  
⁠  
According to MPR News meteorologist Mandy Thalhuber, one of these solar flares is the strongest we’ve seen in this solar cycle and the most powerful flare since 2017.⁠  
⁠  
Our night skies will be mostly clear Friday night and Saturday night, creating ideal conditions to view the northern lights. However, northern Minnesota will start to see some increased cloud cover moving in during the early morning hours on Saturday, and residual cloud cover from the cold front late Saturday.⁠

Due to the nature of my medical conditions I need my CRP to be as low as possible. I've been on a so-called healthy diet and have already lost a lot of weight, nearly hitting my goal, by consuming occasional ground flax, occasional avocado, & constant vegetables & EVOO with occasional fish and a load of spices such as garlic, parsley, coriander, black pepper (all in powder cans, I dont chop/dry it myself).

Twice a week I get a coffee in the morning with flavor shots outside, but if I do, I also have a spoon of perilla oil the same day (Omega-3).

This limited diet is not enough in calories or protein so I also consume 1 or 2 protein shakes every single day, and out of my 21 meals two are cheat meals, one being fast food and the other being general tso. The protein shakes are limited to: Ensure Max (Milk Protein), Evolve 20g (Plant Protein), Core 26g (Milk Protein), meaning while there is just a little bit in seed oils it never dominates the shake! I would still like to keep the diet limited to a few things because I gain it back very easily if I go back to eating a lot. I eat 1200 cal most days and 1600-2100 cal on any day I add those bad foods I mentioned. 

What is lacking in this diet that keeps my CRP higher than what I anticipated?  Or what is in it that's been sabotaging me the whole time.

This is making me fearful of the fact that either:
(a) Just one sesame chicken and one fast food item a week is enough to (slowly) kill me
(b) either the ensure max or Evolve Vanilla and Chocolate shakes are adulterated with untested/undeclared bad substances 
(c) My nearly $40.00 EVOO bottle is not helping or I need 2 tbsp/day instead of 5tbsp/week. 

I do take supplements including Taurine, MSM, Cetyl Myristoleate, Zinc, and even break Selenium capsules to microdose it but I don't take B3,NMN,NR. On many days, my diet is about zero carb/ketogenic, but as I have pointed out there is no way I am in consistent ketosis; I gave three examples why.",1,1728086612.0,diet,2,1.0,False

We started with a 40 minute focus session on a Nicaraguan coffee which was served as a batch brew, and well brewed I might add!

The last 20 minutes were open for us to request that same coffee, brewed any which way - filter, espresso, cortado, or what have you.

The two dozen or so of us who were there had the opportunity to ask any questions on our minds and the hosts, Masha and Ryan, spent time answering all of them in depth.

It was also cool of them to let me stay an extra 2.5 hours after everyone else had left to brew for them. We enjoyed a lovely washed Ethiopian Idido with floral notes about 6 or 7 different ways and got some interesting refractometer data as well.

We found that we all preferred this coffee at around 1.5-1.55 as opposed to the SCA's recommended range of 1.15-1.35.

The Hermosa spot is on the beach while the Carrillo place has a shuttle to and from Playa Carrillo.  I can prearrange pick ups and drop offs between the airport and these locations for a somewhat expensive price, but reasonable by CR standards. 

Last time in CR we rented a car and while we likely could have down without it, it did provide a feeling of freedom that was enjoyable. My family is fine just sitting by pools and beaches, whereas I get a bit antsy. 

My question is about how easy it is to get ride services on these areas. I’m sure my hotels can help with getting a ride out to somewhere, but I don’t want to get stranded without an easy enough way home. I am thinking about trips to breweries, coffee tours, etc. just something to get away for an hour or so.

I don't want to disrespect or dishonor God my harming myself, and since I've been baptized I haven't used it and don't plan to (althought it'd be nice, but I got the self-control) but I got an emotional attachment to it since it helped me so much.

As Cybebe finishes her shift for the security company, she makes her way back to her apartment in Area18. She sheds her uniform and gets into something more comfortable. The coffee machine whirrs and steams as it brews a fresh cup for Cybebe.

In the corner of her eye she sees a notification light on her computer blinking. She adds a little bit of sugar to her coffee and makes her way over to the screen. What she sees next comes as an absolute shock. The notification is of a news story -- an accident... an explosion at Elysium Technologies... her parents' lab. She grabs the screen in disbelief, pulling it closer as she listens to the news anchor talking about the explosion, the accident... the lives lost. The names of her parents mentioned on the list. Cybebe cries out, tears streaming down her face. ""This can't be!"" Her coffee spills onto the floor. ""My parents! ...they..."" she loses grip of the mug entirely and it hits the cold floor, shattering into pieces. ""This was no accident..! They were so close to finishing the Elysium Pulse, its no coincidence... who would do such a thing...""

Later that evening Cybebe receives notice of where the funeral will be held. ""MicroTech... 24 hours after the accident.. why so promptly?"" She thinks to herself as she prepares for the journey from ArcCorp to MicroTech. She gets her hoverbike ready, filling it up with fuel before loading it into her personal ship, the small but trusty Drake ship that she calls, The Reverie. She sits in the cockpit, surrounded by a jumble of wires, blinking consoles, and screen displaying navigation data. Her fingers hover over the controls, heart pounding with anticipation as she preps for the quantum jump.

For some context: my wife and I had our first child six months ago. We were both financially stable, there was no infidelity, and we had a solid relationship—except for her toxic in-laws. Her family constantly overstepped boundaries and treated me terribly, but she never defended me. In fact, she once told me, “If it’s a choice between you and my parents, you won’t like it.” That hurt, but I thought we’d work through it. Eventually, I went no-contact with her family after they abandoned both of us right after our child was born. I made it clear that I wasn’t going to act like nothing happened until I got an apology.

But three months ago, without any discussion or fight—divorce, separation, or even a breakup had never been mentioned in our house—my wife packed up the car, kidnapped our daughter, and took her to her parents’ house. She filed for divorce without speaking to me and refused to return until a judge ordered her back to the city to honor my parental rights.

Now, she’s trying to get 100% legal and physical custody, which is an incredibly high bar in California. Her justification? She’s claiming I’m mentally ill, which I’m not, and her “evidence” is absolutely insane:

• I drank coffee one day and not the next.

• I listened to the same song on repeat one night.

• I recently found out I wear a 10.5 shoe size, not a 9.5.

• I suggested we hire a $25/hour nanny instead of a $35/hour one, even though we can afford it.

• I walk “too much.”

• I chose to walk instead of driving half a mile to pick up a romantic dinner for us.

I know this sounds absurd because it *is* absurd. I can’t believe she not only destroyed our marriage and family, but she’s now trying to take away my time with our daughter based on these ridiculous claims.

We had talked about having more kids and building a future together, and now it’s all gone. I wonder what she’ll say to our daughter one day—why her parents aren’t together, why she doesn’t have a sibling, and why she has to spend holidays between two homes. My wife acted so rashly, and I don’t think she understands the long-term consequences of her actions. None of this looks good or makes sense, and I can’t imagine how she’s explaining this to others without living in a different reality or just straight-up lying.

Before anyone asks, my wife claims she doesn’t have postpartum depression or anxiety and has been checked by a hospital. When I asked her family to get her evaluated because of her behavior, they literally sent me a laughing emoji in response. I’ve done everything I could to support her, but I’m at a loss as to how we ended up here.

For those of you who were left, how would you explain this to your kids in the future?

For those who left, do you think the reasons listed above are valid? Would you regret leaving for these reasons? And how would you explain these reasons to your children in the future?",1,1728085356.0,Divorce,7,0.6,False

“Earplugs in?”

Nobody reacted. Freddy realized his mistake. He raised his voice to a shout.

“Earplugs in?”

This time everyone nodded affirmatively. Some double-checked their earplugs were sealed, and then gave the thumbs-up.

“Okay then, any hearing damage beyond this point is your own fault,” Freddy said. “Alex, on my mark. Three, two, one…”

Freddy gave the signal, and Alex cast the spell, creating portals in the middle of their sealed testing area, on either side of a small launch ramp. She held the opening steady as a small rocket fired and flew through the portals. The platform retracted right afterwards, allowing the rocket to fly in a loop between the two portals, flying in one and right out the other. Alex moved her hands slightly closer together, magically closing the gap between the two portals until they were mere centimeters apart. The rocket traveling between them burned brighter and brighter, accelerating inside the closed loop.

Freddy covered his ears, just to be sure, and his friends did the same. With a nod to Alex, she dropped both the portals.

Whatever happened next was so fast nobody could see it properly with the naked eye, but in the aftermath, the test rocket had completely vaporized itself on a steel plate, leaving only a smoking black smear where it had impacted.

“Neat,” Samson said. He took his fancy earplugs out. “Was there a reason for that beyond obliterating a toy rocket?”

“Reduced friction acceleration,” Freddy said. “That could be very useful for building space elevators and the like. Depending on the data. There was no sonic boom, which was promising.”

“That could be a result of the scaled-down size, though,” Alex said. “We’ll have to do a large scale test some other time.”

“We’ll save that for an aeronautics company, we’re just working on the theory right now,” Freddy said. “Unless you think Harlan Industries has the budget for a supersonic jet, Vell?”

“We could maybe buy you a ticket on someone else’s supersonic jet,” Vell said. “One-way.”

Their budget had been worked down to the bone already setting up the R&D department Vell would soon take charge of, and that Freddy would soon be working in. He was one of the handful of soon-to-be-graduates Vell knew who’d taken him up on the offer of employment.

“We’ll stick to theory for now,” Freddy said. “But we can save parsing the data for tomorrow.”

“Maybe over lunch?” Alex suggested, trying not to blush as she spoke.

“I’ve got to call home at lunch,” Freddysaid. “We’ll have to doitin lab hours.”

“Okay.”

“Right now I think I could go for dessert,” Freddy said. The experiment had taken most of the day to set up, so it was already after dinner. “Anybody want some ice cream?”

“Sounds good,” Hawke said. “I could go for some-”

Kim put him in a chokehold mid-sentence.

“We have something to do,” Kim hissed.

“We do?”

Kim forcibly jerked Hawke’s head towards Alex, who was glancing nervously between Freddy and the other spectators.

“Oh, we do,” Hawke said. “Right. Maybe some other time, Freddy.”

Kim released the chokehold, and they hustled right out of the room. Samson watched them go.

“What have they got going on?”

“The same thing as us,” Vell said, as he snatched Samson and dragged him out of the room in turn. Freddy did not find this suspicious at all, given some of the loopers’ past behavior. His only instinct was to turn to Alex.

“You’re heading out too, I assume?”

“No.”

“Really?”

“I’m not involved in every weird thing they do,” she said.

“Could’ve fooled me,” Freddy said.

“I would like to be involved in some ice cream, though,” Alex said. “If that’s alright with you.”

“Why would it not be?”

He put away the last of the experiment supplies and shouldered his bag,then headed out. Alex walked next to him, but not exactly next to him, because matching him step for step would be weird. She briefly walked a little ahead of Freddy, and then wondered if that made her look too domineering, so she slowed down to walk behind him, and then worried that might make him lose track of her, so she subtly alternated her pace so that she would be next to him for two steps, and then shift slightly behind but still be visible out of the corner of his eye, but not fall so far behind he’d lose track.

“Are you alright, Alex?”

“Fine!”

“You’re walking funny, is all.”

“Earplugs threw off my inner ear equilibrium,” Alex snapped.

“That’s...they shouldn’t do that,” Freddy said. “I’ll have to adjust the equipment.”

“No the equipment’s fine I’m just weird,” Alex said.

“Correct,” Freddy said. Alex let out a single nervous chuckle. She rode the high of that friendly banter until they made it to the dining hall and took their seats. Alex was more confident in her ability to sit normally. She’d been practicing.

Freddy ordered their desert through an app, and a delivery drone dropped two bowls of ice cream right in front of them.

“Excellent work on the portals today,” Freddy said, between spoonfuls. “Most people can’t hold them together under that kind of kinetic stress.”

“It wasn’t my first rodeo,” Alex said. She’d had to pull a similar trick to trap a sentient bullet a few apocalypses ago.

“We hang out with Vell, I think we’ve all been to several rodeos by proxy,” Freddy said. Alex nodded in agreement.

“I’ve also been to a few actual rodeos,” Alex said.

“Really?”

“Yeah. I’m from Montana, remember? Surprisingly strong rodeo scene up there.”

“You enjoy them?”

“No, there just wasn’t a lot else to do near the reservation,” Alex said.

“Hmm. I see why you hit the books so much.”

“Oh, that was...something else,” Alex said. Her parents had always stressed the importance of doing good in school, even to the detriment of everything else.Freddy had dealt with enough messed up people to recognize trauma when he saw it, so he did not push the issue.

“So, any other hobbies?”

Alex was glad to take the change of subject, even if it wasn’t much of a subject. She actually didn’t do much.Thankfully they pivoted to Freddy’s hobbies soon enough.

“I’m really looking forward to final’s being over,” Freddy said. “I have a lot of anime to catch up on.”

“You know, I never really got anime,” Alex said. “It just seems like a lot of people screaming at each other and fighting.”

“Oh there’s way more to it than that.”

More than once, Alex had wondered if her attraction to Freddy was genuine, or if she had just latched on to his act of kindness, and she was pleasantly surprised to find objective proof that her feelings were real. Only genuine attraction could possibly survive a ten-minute rant about different types of anime.

“I’ll get you to watch Baccano sometime, you’ll get it,” Freddy said, concluding his rant.

“I’d like that,” Alex said, and she genuinely meant it. “We could try and find a night to watch a few episodes, at least.”

“Maybe, but you know how hard it is to get everyone together,” Freddy said.

“Well, I didn’t mean everybody,” Alex said. “More like...just you and me, maybe?”

“Oh, like…”

Alex and Freddy made eye contact, and froze solid as the remnants of their ice cream melted. Both of them were equally terrified about what the next few words of that sentence would be. Somehow, that was more comforting than any amount of encouragement or coaching ever could’ve been.

“A date, yeah,” Alex said. She ate a spoonful of ice cream just to have an excuse to hide her growing smile.

For a second, Freddy’s face went completely blank.Alex got the feeling his heart and brain had both stopped. Then he blinked, and everything started working again.

“Yeah.I’d like that.”

“Okay. Okay! Uh, tomorrow, then, at dinner, maybe?”

“Yeah, I can free up an hour or two,” Freddy said. “That works.”

“Good.”

Alex nodded, and Freddy nodded. Then they stared at each other for a second. Both of them started to go red in the face.

“I don’t know what I’m supposed to do now,” Alex said.

“Neither do I. This has never happened to me before,” Freddy mumbled.

“Should I leave? Would that be rude?”

“One of us has to leave eventually, we can’t just sit here all night,” Freddy said.

“Okay, and I just leave, I don’t have to shake your hand, or kiss you on the cheek, or something?”

“I think you could’ve but it’d be weird to do that now,” Freddy said.

“Right. Leaving now, bye!”

Alex stood up and zipped around the corner, out of sight, before poking her head back around the corner.

“I’ll see you tomorrow! At our date!”

“Yeah, see you then.”

Alex turned and fled, thinking all the while of just how stupid that entire exchange had been.

\*\*\*

“Genome sequence of the Kisslip Cuttlefish?”

“TATGTCAATGACACAATTATTATT,” Skye said, without any hesitation. Vell checked her textbook and found she was correct. “Okay, my turn.”

“Correctorderfor the Ephram-Miller ‘Bouncy Ball’ rune sequence?”

“Sphere-energy/impact-capture-reverse-expel,” Vell said.

“I feel like that one was easier than mine,”Skye said.

“I didn’t write the tests,” Vell said. With finals only a few weeks away, they had made a game of theirnightlystudy sessions. They quizzed each other, and whoever got a question wrong firsthad to make coffee in the morning. They were mostly even so far, but Vell had been on a winning streak the past few days, one Skye was determined to break.

“I’m going to have to look for a hard one next,” Skye said. She perused the study guide andlooked for a real challenge, right up until someone knocked on the door. “Oh, maybe our next question can be ‘who’s bothering you this time’?”

“I already know,” Vell sighed.He stood up, opened the door, and let Alex nearly tumble through it.

“Vell! I need your help!”

“Of course you do,” Vell said. “What happened?”

“I asked Freddy on a date!”

“Oh god, did he turn you down?”

“No!”

Vell put both his hands together as if in prayer, held them to his lips for a moment, and then pointed them towards Alex.

“I’m sorry, I’m confused,”Vell said. “Was this not the goal?”

“I’ve never been on a date before, Vell,” Alex said. “What happens when I mess it up?”

“You mess it up,” Vell said with a shrug. “Look, Freddy likes you well enough to go on a date, all you have to do is be the same version of yourself he already likes. Stressing about it or trying to change at the last minute is going to make things worse, not better.”

“That’s...that’s probably right.”

“You’ll be fine,” Vell assured her. He put a hand on Alex’s shoulder for a little extra reassurance. “Just-”

There was another knock on Vell’s door. He looked up at the door and sighed.

“Hi Freddy.”

“How did- Alex is here, isn’t she?”

“Hi,” Alex squeaked. Freddy poked his head through the door and beamed with an awkward smile.

“Great minds think alike, I guess.”

“And apparently they think of borrowing someone else’s mind,” Vell said. “Look, you’re obviously both equally nervous about this, just goin understanding you’rebothawkwardand be willing to overlook a bit of stammering and some sweaty palms, alright?’

Freddy and Alex shared an awkward glance and nodded in unison.

“Okay, great, glad we have an understanding,” Vell said. “Now, final note, I have been trying to be a little more assertive, would you two mind if I practiced something on you?”

They both nodded again.

“Great, thanks,” Vell said. He threw both hands towards the door. “Get out of my dorm!”

Alex gave a quiet yelp of surprise and scampered out the door. Whatever awkwardness ensued between her and Freddy once she was out the door was not for Vell to know, nor to care about. He returned to the couch and plopped down next to Skye.

“I think you could’ve upped the volume a bit, but that was very good,” Skye said.

“Thanks,” Vell said. “I have no idea why they came to me for relationship advice in the first place. I mean, me?”

Skye gestured to herself with both hands. She certainly considered their relationship worth emulating. They’d made plans to move in together after graduating only days ago.

“You have been way more patient with me than I deserve,” Vell said. “If you weren’t so cool I would’ve fucked this up ages ago.”

“Don’t sell yourself short, handsome,” Skye said. “Most guys would’ve dumped me after I accidentally made them grow scales.”

“You got rid of them,” Vell said. It had been a very itchy half hour, but only half an hour. “Now, where we were on the tests?”

“We were at the part where I finally outwit you,” Skye said. She gave him a quick kiss on the cheek, and the testing resumed.

\*\*\*

Alex nearly tripped over herself as she scuttled to the loopers usual spot for breakfast. The dining hall was less crowded today, giving her plenty of room to recover as she stumbled.

“I see sleeping on it has done nothing to help your nerves,” Vell said. He sipped at a cup of coffee he’d made that morning.

“If anything, it’s now worse,” Alex said. “I realized that today is an apocalypse!”

“So?”

“So disaster will almost certainly strike right in the middle of my date,”Alex said.

“Why would that happen?”

“It always happens! The stories you’ve told me about the incidents with Caesar’s ghost and cursed Khmer warriors and the living paintings alone-”

“Alex, those were isolated incidents, I have gone on dozens of dates with Skye with literally no problems,” Vell said. “I just don’t tell you about them because they’re not interesting.”

“But it’s a first date, something’s bound to go wrong!”

“I have also been on first dates with no incident,” Hawke said. Samson nodded as well. Neither of them had found a long-term relationship, but they had gone on occasional dates,all entirely without ghosts or ghouls of any sort.

“But it’s my first date. Ever!”

“Do you think the universe cares enough about you to go out of its way to ruin your day?”

“Yeah, it only does that for Vell,” Kim said. Vell paused mid-sip to glare at her, but he had no rebuttal.

“It hasn’t exactly been kind to me before,” Alex mumbled.

“First of all, champ, a significant amount of your problems have been your own fault,” Kim said. “Don’t blame the universe for you being a bitch. Secondly, I can guarantee the daily apocalypse isn’t going to interfere with your date.”

“How can- Ah,” Alex said. “Should I bother turning around?”

“Oh, you’re fine, it’s just a bunch of little dudes,” Kim said.

Alex turned around and saw a small army running towards them. Small in that there were only a hundred or so, and small in that they wereabout six incheshigh. The horde of miniature people in Victorian finery scrambled past in a hurry, shouting something about eggs as they ran.

“That didn’t seem very apocalyptic,” Alex said.

“Not on their own,” Vell said. “Those were Lilliputians. They’re mean little bastards, but the real problem is-”

A looming shadow fell over the entire dining hall as a towering humanoid frame stood between it and the sun.

“-the Brobdingnagians,” Vell said. “Who are very, very large bastards.”

The colossal figure reached through the wall, tearing through it as if it was no sturdier than paper, and then snatched up a handful of students. It examined them as if they were dolls, and then discarded the ones it didn’t like, throwing them seventy feet to the ground.

“I always like an early morning apocalypse, really frees up the rest of the schedule,” Vell said, as he readied his guns.

\*\*\*

Kim slammed the copy of Gulliver’s Travels shut, and put it back on the shelf with the rest of the library books.Hawke looked on and nodded in admiration.

“How’d you fit that big guy back in the book anyway?”

“Lot of elbow grease,” Kim said.

“Like, figuratively, or do you have literal grease in your elbow?”

“It was figurative, but come to think of it, I could use a good lube,” Kim said. She flexed an arm that had undoubtedly been worn down by wrestling fictional characters back into the book where they belonged. “Good thing to do while we’re inside avoiding Alex all day.”

“Oh good, we’re on the same page about that,” Hawke said.

“Yep. Against all odds, I have actually started to sort of like Alex,” Kim said. Now that she was not being such an asshole about everything,Alex’sself-centered cluelessness was almost endearing. “I’m not going to jeopardize that progress by having her be a nervous wreck around me all day.”

“Hard agree,” Hawke said. “Mind if I go get some snacks and I can spend the rest of my day pretending to help you with maintenance?”

“I was going to invite you anyway.”

\*\*\*

Alex ran the mental checklist in her head. Nobody had gotten hurt, no damage had been done to any property, and Freddy still seemed to be happy spending time with her.They had a lovely conversation over dinner, laughed at each other’s jokes, and she was even enjoying the strange japanese cartoon Freddy was having her watch, though it had taken her a while to figure out the multiple ongoing timelines. Objectively speaking, the date was goinggreat.

Internally, Alex was trapped in an inescapable nightmare. Every moment was a torrent of anxiety, as she wondered if she was sitting too close or too far, laughing too much or not enough, if her clothes were right, if her hair was right, if anything she was doing was right or if it was all a complete disaster.Alex had neverbeen more nervous or more happy.

The latest episode wrapped up, and Freddy checked the time.

“I think we’re cutting it a bit close,” Freddy said. Both had carved time out of their busy schedules for the date, and that time was starting to run out. “We’ve still got a few minutes, I guess, if you want to, uh, talk.”

“I do like talking to you,” Alex said. Then she mentally slapped herself in the face. “Sorry, that was weird.”

“No, I get it,” Freddy said. “I needed to hear that, I think. I’m so nervous I worry I’m being awkward.”

“Well you’re not,” Alex said. “Am I?”

“Nope.”

Alex made a mental note of that.

“Then...do you want to do this again sometime?”

“Does Thursday work?”

“Thursday works,” Alex said. “Goodnight.”

“Goodnight.”

Alex stepped out of the room, red in the face. She stood just outside the door and stared blankly ahead.

“Is that it?”

\*\*\*

“If you were expecting a kiss, that usually doesn’t happen on the first date,” Vell said, without taking his eyes off his textbook.

“I wasn’t,” Alex said. “I was just expecting something more...something. At all.”

“Love isn’t usually one of those explosive dramatic surge feeling thingies,” Kim said. “If it is, there’s a non-zero chance you’ve been brainwashed, so you should be skeptical of feeling like that.”

“Congratulations on your perfectly normal date, and the beginning of a perfectly normal relationship,” Vell said. “We should all be so lucky.”

“Just based on historical trends, I expected some kind of calamity,” Alex said. “An apocalypse, interference from Kraid, a scheduling conflict, at the very least.”

“If you really want your dates to be ruined that badly, I could third wheel your next dinner and chew with my mouth open,” Samson suggested.

“I’m not asking for trouble, it’s just weird that it didn’t happen,” Alex snapped.

“I kind of get it,” Hawke said. “Kind of.”

“Well then I will take my ‘kind of’ sympathy and quit while I’m ahead,” Alex said.She grabbed her things and headed out. “I’ll see you all at the daily disaster.”

“Adios, muchacha,” Kim said. She saluted as Alex left the room and headed across the quad.

The school was bustling with students headed between classes and tests and homework and meals, just like always. Everything was completely normal.

Out of curiosity, Alex cast a simple light spell. Without a single spark of gray on her fingertips, the magic orb coalesced into a deep emerald green glow. A few shades darker than the bright green magic she’d originally had, years ago, but perfectly stable and healthy. It felt strange, and Alex didn’t understand why.

But there was only one person who might sympathize. Alex headed for the senior dorms, and the room that had once been Skye’s, but now belonged to Joan Marsh.Alex knew the code, but she knocked on the door anyway. And then knocked again a minute later. She could hear motion inside the dorm now, so she waited for the extra minute it took Joan to actually answer the door.When she did, the wrinkly clothes she wore and the haphazard tangle of her hair made it clear she had just gotten out of bed.

“Sorry, sorry, I just- You’re not Ming.”

“Who is Ming and why would I be them?”

“I’m tutoring some first year dudes,” Joan said. Her knowledge couldn’t compete with students of later years, but she knew enough about the first year curriculum to help others. She checked the time and realized she had not actually slept through her scheduled appointment and sighed with relief. “Anyway, what’s up, Lex?”

“I wanted to talk about something, if you have the time,” Alex said.

“I very clearly have the time,” Joan said, gesturing to her unkempt appearance. “But do you have the time to let me take a shower before we have any heart to hearts? It’s hard to take life advice seriously when it comes from someone greasy.”

“I concur,” Alex said. She also smelled a little, but Alex had learned it was not polite to mention that. “Go ahead.”

Joan closed the door, and Alex waited patiently for the several minutes it took her to finish her shower. She was still visibly damp when she opened the door again, but it was an improvement over being entirely unwashed.

“Okay, good to go,” Joan said. She beckoned Alex inside and took a seat on the couch. “What’s eating you, Alex?”

“Well, I went on a date with Freddy last night…”

“I heard,” Joan said. “He was very excited about it.”

“And I was excited too! It just feels...I don’t know, like there should be more,” Alex said. “Like I needed to do more to earn it, or there should be more reactions, or something, I don’t know!”

Alex could not articulate her feelings at all, which made it all the more surprising thatJoan nodded in understanding.

“Oh, yeah, I get it,” Joan said. “Welcome to maintenance mode.”

“Maintenance mode?”

“Yep, maintenance mode,” Joan said. “I had the same feeling, especially after I started dating Lee.After months of hard work and personal growth, you’ve reached the exact same level as the average person. You’ve crossed your last milestone, no more huge hurdles, and no more pats on the back.”

“But I still have to put so much work into everything,” Alex said. Though she had learned to control the impulses, her first instinct was usually to fall back on her same old rude, self-centered behavior.

“I know that and you know that, but nobody else is going to know that,”Joan said. “The battle’s entirely internal from here on out, and nobody’s going to appreciate how hard it is. Except maybe Vell. He’s weirdly sympathetic.”

“But what if I still need help?”

“Then you ask for it, like you’re doing right now,” Joan said. “But the only thing you’ve done is learn how to not be an asshole, and the average person is not an asshole all the [time.As](http://time.As) far as anyone else is concerned, you’re just a regular joe now.”

“I suppose there are worse things to be,” Alex said.

“Yep. We could still be assholes,” Joan said with a chuckle. “Just take it slow. Remember what you’ve learned, and be patient with yourself. You’ll be fine.”

“Thanks,” Alex said. “I do have one related question, also, if that’s alright?”

“Sure, I’ll answer any questions you got,” Joan said. In spite of that promise, it took Alex a few seconds to muster the nerve to ask her question.

“How many dates am I supposed to go on before...well, you know,” Alex mumbled.

“Never mind, I will not answer those questions,” Joan said.

“But-”

“But nothing, I am not your sex coach.”

“I was talking about kissing!”

“That’s still weird,” Joan said. “Just, I don’t know, you’ll know when the time is right. And maybe ask Freddy before you do it. Warn him at least, jeez, he’d probably have a heart attack if you took him by surprise.”

“Okay. And when I do, how do I-”

“No, nope, not going there,” Joan said. “Lifecoaching session over, I’m back to being an asshole.”

“But I don’t know what to do!”

“You’re smart, you’ll figure it out,” Joan said. “Now I got to get ready for a tutoring session, so excuse me.”

“Fine, I can take a hint,”Alex grunted.

“This is only partially a deflection method, I overslept by like two hours,” Joan said. “I would appreciate some time to prepare.”

“Oh, sorry. I’ll get out of your hair.”

Alex left, but she was slightly suspicious about the speed with which Joan shut the door behind her. She stood for a second, wondering what to do next. Hopefully something normal.

A nearby window crashed open, and Kim crashed through in a shower of broken glass and rubble. She laid on the floor for a second and looked up at Alex.

“Hey Alex,” Kim said.She had a small dent in her chin.“There’s some fruit punch out there with some very literal punch. You in?”

Alex nodded, and her hands flared with deep green light. Kim jumped right back out the hole in the wall, and Alex followed. She’d learned to be a lot more normal, but she’d never be that normal.",0,1728085318.0,redditserials,1,0.5,False
1fwd5xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1fwd5xs/hey_respresso_im_the_founder_of_empirical_water/,"Hey r/espresso, I'm the founder of empirical water: The original nature-inspired coffee brew water. Ask me anything!","# Note: To try empirical water, drop a comment on my [GIVEAWAY](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1fsgi87/empirical_water_giveaway_comment_for_a_chance_to/).

The giveaway features a complete $120 bundle of all the coffee water products I currently offer, and will have not one, but FIVE winners! Open to entries until Sunday October 6, at 11:59 PM.

[Hi, it's Arby!](https://preview.redd.it/6rcsqna0qtsd1.jpg?width=2314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=66887ddc4e1c7804924ddb7c3ecd685e118ac40c)

My name is Arby Avanesian, and I founded empirical water: A project that aims to reverse-engineer naturally occurring mineral waters, using an iterative approach to bring each mineral profile closer over time to ideal brewing characteristics.

So far I have created 4 mineral profiles inspired by nature: snowmelt, glacial, spring, and aquifer. glacial and spring are currently available to the public.

I feel that water is the lens through which we appreciate specialty coffee, and so I want to offer these vastly differing lenses to showcase all the magnificent qualities in coffee.

[The complete bundle, that brews 128 cups of coffee, or like, a LOT of espresso.](https://preview.redd.it/h3pr3abeqtsd1.png?width=4724&format=png&auto=webp&s=860e3a9bc13acff123580084ed1d691b796b82d0)

To achieve what I consider ideal brewing characteristics, I make use of unusual ingredients and techniques, like calcium carbonate, silica, and a labor-intensive carbonation/dissolution/decarbonation process that emulates nature's process for dissolving limestone in water. My approach to water for coffee is to optimize purely for quality, with no thought given to the potential for mass production.

My goal is not to become the next big water brand. I just want to provide water that does justice to the incredible work of farmers, roasters and everyone else involved in the supply chain of specialty coffee. If you'd like to get my perspectives and opinions on water for coffee, feel free to check out the very recent article published on Roast Magazine's [**Daily Coffee News**](https://dailycoffeenews.com/2024/10/02/empirical-water-aims-for-observable-improvements-in-coffee-brewing/).

A little about what/how I brew: I enjoy brewing all roasts, from the ultralights to the French roasts, as espresso. I love both straight espresso and milk drinks using all roasts. My favorite part about espresso is its versatility in both the coffees you can brew with it, and the drinks you can create.

So, there is a lot of skepticism about how impactful water really is, and to address that straight out the gates, I'll list my world class endorsements [**HERE**](https://empiricalwater.com/pages/endorsements). I am also honored to report that the legendary Scott Rao presented his own roasts with my glacial profile at his latest pop-up in LA, where I was incredibly fortunate to meet him and talk about water and coffee. He's a really nice guy IRL, btw, and I highly recommend attending his events if he's ever in your area. His Rubi Chiroso is insane, btw.

Disclaimer: I am not a scientist. I am just an earnest observer that has put the majority of my time into this aspect of optimizing coffee (and tea!) over the last several years. My experience consists of both blind and sequential tasting, and collecting feedback from the hundreds of folks I've sent samples to for evaluation. If I do not know the answer to a question, I'll try to find a relevant source for you, or simply state that I don't know the answer.

Without further ado, please ask me anything.",0,1728085258.0,espresso,0,0.43,False

**Overview**

Novus Roleplay was founded on the premise that the most important part of roleplay was the players' ability to create the character scenes they wanted. We view the job of our community to facilitate a supportive, quality atmosphere for players. Novus is based in the non-lore State of New Malverne, offering El Reno, Prescott Lake, and Alpine Beach.

Our development team has spent thousands of hours remodeling/texturing the GTA V environment for this immersive experience. Our cities are where characters live, laugh and love while crime, despair, and conflict brew just under the surface.

**Planting Your Roots.**

*Create a Story, with Epic roleplays mixed all over.* To help guide character development, Novus RP uses character alignments. Pick from nine different character paths and create the story. Be ready to engage with other stories along the way.

**Live. Work. Play.**

Your character moves to a new city or wakes up to a new morning where they’ve been their entire life. Where do you choose for your character to live? Options await. Each character has a different path that we know you’ve thought a lot about including work. Our player-managed businesses are meant to serve as a base. Player-owned businesses allow you to come up with your new ideas, rent or buy an available shop, and create roleplay opportunities. The character you’ve created has spent their time working hard selling coffee, putting out fires, or maybe slinging drugs. Time to have fun and play in a city full of options.

**No Admission Required.**

*We break down the walls to give you options.* While your character must meet the IC minimums, there are no OOC walls you must leap over to do fun things like start a business, creating a faction or having an idea featured in the server. It is our goal to erase ‘click’ or ‘friend favoritism’ mentalities, leading to a more fair roleplay community.

**Pure Life Economy.**

In-server currency is evenly earned by players both legally or illegally. *No items are spawned in, or obtainable through ‘pay to pay’ patreon subscriptions or donator perks.* We aim to make it fair for all.

**No Lag or Poor Equipment.**

All of Novus Roleplay facilities are hosted on a 100% Dedicated Server with industry-leading components and a fast internet uplink. This means your player data will save and you can expect little to no server lag. We don’t cut corners.

1fwcw61,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1fwcw61/explain_gilmore_girls_using_gossip_girl/,"explain gilmore girls using gossip girl
","Imagine \*Gilmore Girls\* as the cozy, small-town cousin to the high-glamour, high-drama world of \*Gossip Girl\*. Both shows revolve around the lives of young women navigating the complexities of family, love, and social class, but they do so in very different environments and with a distinct tone. To explain \*Gilmore Girls\* using \*Gossip Girl\* as a reference point, let’s dive deeper into how the two worlds compare:



\*\*Stars Hollow vs. Upper East Side:\*\*

If \*Gossip Girl\* is all about the glittering, cutthroat world of New York City’s Upper East Side, \*Gilmore Girls\* is set in the opposite—a quaint, charming small town called Stars Hollow. In \*Gossip Girl\*, everything is about status, wealth, and image, and Manhattan is practically a character in itself, with its luxury penthouses and exclusive parties. In \*Gilmore Girls\*, Stars Hollow is similarly central, but the town is more of a quirky, idyllic place where everyone knows everyone else's business. Instead of socialites and scheming, Stars Hollow is filled with eccentric characters—like Kirk, Taylor, and Miss Patty—who add humor and heart, gossiping over coffee at Luke’s Diner instead of the latest scandalous blog post.



\*\*Rory Gilmore is the Dan Humphrey of Stars Hollow:\*\*

In \*Gossip Girl\*, Dan Humphrey is the “outsider” who finds himself navigating the world of the rich and powerful. Rory Gilmore mirrors that arc. Raised by her single mom, Lorelai, Rory is from a humble background, living in a modest home in Stars Hollow. Her entry into Chilton, a prestigious private school, is her introduction to a wealthier, more competitive world, much like Dan’s journey at St. Jude's. Both Rory and Dan are academically gifted, coming from less privileged backgrounds compared to their peers, and they initially feel out of place amidst the old-money elite. Rory’s desire to succeed at Chilton (and later at Yale) echoes Dan’s ambition to rise above his Brooklyn roots.



\*\*Lorelai Gilmore as Serena van der Woodsen’s rebellious older version:\*\*

Lorelai Gilmore can be seen as a kind of grown-up, more grounded Serena van der Woodsen. Like Serena, Lorelai comes from a wealthy, established family (the Gilmores) and has a complicated relationship with her privileged background. While Serena rebels by disappearing for months and making questionable choices, Lorelai’s rebellion was much more drastic—she left her parents’ upper-crust life entirely after getting pregnant at 16, choosing independence and moving to Stars Hollow to raise Rory on her own. Both Lorelai and Serena are known for their charm, charisma, and ability to win people over, but where Serena is often caught up in scandal, Lorelai is more focused on building a stable life for herself and her daughter, working her way up from a maid at an inn to eventually owning her own business.



\*\*Emily Gilmore as a more sympathetic version of Lily van der Woodsen:\*\*

Emily Gilmore, Lorelai’s mother, is like a more emotionally complex and controlling version of Lily van der Woodsen. Both Emily and Lily are wealthy, elegant women who expect their daughters to follow in their footsteps and maintain the family’s social standing. They often disapprove of their daughters' choices and lifestyles, which leads to a lot of tension. However, where Lily is more of a background figure in \*Gossip Girl\*, often busy managing her own complicated love life, Emily is central to the family dynamics in \*Gilmore Girls\*. Her constant push-and-pull with Lorelai over family expectations, tradition, and control drives much of the show's emotional core. Beneath her icy exterior, Emily cares deeply about Lorelai and Rory, even if her way of showing it is through strict adherence to upper-class values.



\*\*Relationships and Drama:\*\*

In \*Gossip Girl\*, relationships are dramatic and often scandalous, full of betrayals, cheating, and social maneuvering. \*Gilmore Girls\*, by contrast, focuses on more grounded relationship dynamics, though it’s not without its fair share of romantic drama. Rory’s love interests—Dean, Jess, and Logan—are akin to Dan, Nate, and Chuck in \*Gossip Girl\*. Dean is the sweet, grounded first love (like Nate), Jess is the brooding, bad-boy intellectual (like Dan at his most cynical), and Logan is the charming, wealthy playboy (very Chuck Bass). But while \*Gossip Girl\* thrives on breakups, makeups, and jaw-dropping secrets, \*Gilmore Girls\* is more focused on personal growth, communication, and the complexities of balancing love with ambition.



\*\*Friday Night Dinners vs. Gossip Girl Blasts:\*\*

The iconic “Friday night dinners” in \*Gilmore Girls\* could be seen as the show’s equivalent to the infamous Gossip Girl blasts. Instead of a cryptic text from Gossip Girl revealing a scandalous secret, the Gilmore family’s Friday night dinners are where big revelations and conflicts often unfold. These dinners are a battleground for Lorelai, Rory, and Emily, where old wounds are opened and family tensions come to a head. Just like a Gossip Girl post, you never know what’s going to be said or what drama might erupt at the table. The difference is, while Gossip Girl is all about public humiliation and social fallout, the stakes in \*Gilmore Girls\* are more intimate—about family, personal pride, and the struggle to understand each other across generations.



\*\*The Tone:\*\*

Where \*Gossip Girl\* is a dark, stylish portrayal of Manhattan’s elite, with an emphasis on scandal, \*Gilmore Girls\* is lighthearted and heartwarming, with rapid-fire dialogue, pop culture references, and a comforting sense of community. The tone of \*Gilmore Girls\* is ultimately about love—between mother and daughter, between friends, and even between Rory and her grandparents, despite the differences in their worlds. \*Gossip Girl\* often delves into betrayal and the darker sides of ambition, while \*Gilmore Girls\* emphasizes family bonds, personal growth, and the everyday struggles of balancing relationships, work, and aspirations.



So, in short: if \*Gossip Girl\* is a high-stakes, glamorous soap opera about secrets and status, \*Gilmore Girls\* is its gentler, more wholesome counterpart—less about scheming and backstabbing, and more about personal relationships, family dynamics, and finding your path in a world that sometimes feels like it’s pulling you in opposite directions. Both shows explore class and ambition, but they do so in ways that reflect their unique settings and tones.",0,1728084458.0,GilmoreGirls,0,0.5,False

Anyways, with that being said, it’s starting to look like I need to take any job I can get next to keep afloat. To be clear, that’s a full-time job or a contract job, not something part-time like working at a coffee shop, retail, etc. (nothing wrong with that, but I’d prefer to work in my field).

1fwcoq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Metallica/comments/1fwcoq4/lars_ulrichs_drumming_style_explained/,Lars Ulrich's drumming style explained.,"This is one for the music nerds.

It seems like every couple of weeks a video invades my feed telling me how hopeless Lars is as a drummer. And it's getting fucken boring. So I'm going to hopefully shed some light for all the haters out there about how heavy rock bands at the highest level actually make the music regular people want to listen to. 

The first thing you need to know about popular bands is that the different members make different contributions to the music, and I'm not talking about one playing drums, one singing, etc,,, I'm talking about the buzz that they create for the song regardless of what instrument they play. One way (but not the only way) of looking at this is to divide musicians into two categories. Mesmerizing and Energizing.

Here's a video of Black Sabbath, the godfathers of metal, where you can clearly hear, because of the very loud guitar mix, Tony Iommi is playing a Mesmerizing guitar line while Bill Ward is playing an Energizing drum line underneath it.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJBQwOIMzDQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJBQwOIMzDQ)

If you focus on the guitars of Tony Iommi he makes you want to sit back in your chair and bath in it's sonic goodness. But if you focus on the drums of Bill Ward he makes you feel like jumping out of your chair and throwing your computer monitor through the window.

Gezzer Butler and Ozzy Ozborne are both playing Mesmerizing parts along with Tony Iommi, leaving Bill Ward to do all the Energizing work for the band, which he does brilliantly. so, the magic formula for heavy metal that Black Sabbath gave the world was this: hypnotic Mesmerizing guitars and vocals, with wild Energizing drums. The reason this works is that at no time in the song does Ward disrupt the Mesmerizing flow of the three guys up front. 

Which brings us to the only rule of playing Energizing music: Never disrupt the timing of the mesmerizing players. I have little doubt that they learned this from The Who. It was Keith Moon after all who set off dynamite blowing up a hotel toilet. Not something people who enjoy chilling usually do, but if you wanted to have any chance of surviving on tour with this guy you'd have to be an absolute master at chilling. Necessity breads invention.

Now, moving on to Metallica. They follow the same basic formula as Sabbath (with Mesmerizing Guitars, Bass and Vocals, and Energizing drums), with the only difference being that Kirk Hammet plays Energizing lead breaks.

Here's the Isolated tracks from Battery so you can clearly hear what's going on with each member.

James Rhythm

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBG7V\_8PtHc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBG7V_8PtHc)

Kirk Lead

[https://youtu.be/rBG7V\_8PtHc?si=c\_2t1eo8HHSbuzvr&t=198](https://youtu.be/rBG7V_8PtHc?si=c_2t1eo8HHSbuzvr&t=198)

Cliff Bass

[https://youtu.be/nI8QPGSRxMA?si=yfdafVV4wFFZ5ZwS&t=95](https://youtu.be/nI8QPGSRxMA?si=yfdafVV4wFFZ5ZwS&t=95)

Lars Drums

[https://youtu.be/23M7\_11xwl4?si=-lzxKOHT0v9fN\_sq&t=85](https://youtu.be/23M7_11xwl4?si=-lzxKOHT0v9fN_sq&t=85)

James and Cliff isolated are amazing to chill to, like hitting the wine cask after a shit day at the factory. Where as Lars and Kirk are like a double shot coffee when you're already tweaked out in the office. But slam them all together and that's when the bourbon/colas at the party kick in.

Here's an example of the magic not happening, when Dave Lombardo (one of the greatest Mesmerizing drummers in all of metal) filled in for Lars at Donington. (This is every Lars critics wet dream btw)

[https://youtu.be/96nV-x3jfLg?si=XiLjSe4enqnHucK3&t=64](https://youtu.be/96nV-x3jfLg?si=XiLjSe4enqnHucK3&t=64)

Here you've got James (dominating Kirk in the rhythm mix as he always does), Rob (who is also a fantastic Mesmerizing player) and Dave Lombardo, all working together perfectly at hypnotizing the crowd, but the only problem is Kerry King isn't there amping the music up. If you've been standing out in a field for six hours drinking beers, going fuckn mental, and a band comes on all hypnotic all of a sudden, you're not gonna last very long! 

But when Kirk turns up with the lead break, holy shit!!!

[https://youtu.be/96nV-x3jfLg?si=7QJ8t0hCWws4gbPm&t=190](https://youtu.be/96nV-x3jfLg?si=7QJ8t0hCWws4gbPm&t=190)

Hopefully I've explained this concept properly, about how these two elements emanating from different band members combine to make heavy music a far more magical experience.

So in short: If you want to be a Mesmerizing player you need to practice a lot with a metronome and play loads of predictable repetitions very accurately, and if you want to be an Energizing player you need to practice being wild, without a metronome, but making sure you aren't pushing or dragging the tempo around by always submitting to the Mesmerizing players rhythm. 

This guitar dominant style was created by Sabbath, then carried on faithfully by Metallica (and many others), and was wrecked completely in the 2000s by the quantized drum machine metal we get nowadays. Not only does the human drum machine not Energize, as it's had the life crushed out of it, but it doesn't Mesmerize either. It just fucken zombie drumming.

Here's Rick Beato, in what should have been a death blow to quantized drumming, but sadly wasn't because money. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT4fFolyZYU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT4fFolyZYU)

How many wrecked albums have came out that could have been saved, if only they'd watched this video first? I don't even wanna know.

If everyone could please stop hating on Lars and start hating on Quantized Zombie Drum Machines that would be a step towards a brighter future for all of humanity.

I’ve been debating on whether or not to post this but I have to because it’s been 2 days and I still cannot regulate my emotions, I don’t feel safe in my home, and I’m just exhausted. 

Onto my story: a few weeks ago my husband and I attended an event and had our dog walker schedule to feed her dinner and talk her for a walk. They were an hour late and then let her out in the yard without a leash. She’s an escape artist and it’s established that after two jumps (my girls got some ups) over our 6 foot fence that she is not to go out there without a leash. We received no notification they were going to be late and the only reason I knew she was unleashed is because I was watching my cameras like a hawk waiting for them to show up. 

The next time they came to walk her they left my front door unlocked on their way out.

Now the big thing: a few days ago they were late again, again no notification they were running late. After they left I got a text telling me my dog had found a pile of leaves with poop in it and decided to roll around in it. Now, I know dogs do this but she has literally NEVER done this. She won’t even poop in our yard, if we don’t walk her she holds it. Other facts to consider, there are no leaf piles in my neighborhood and everyone who walks dogs here lives here so they clean up after their dogs. WHERE WAS THIS POOP FILLED PILE OF LEAVES?!?! Sorry, I digress. They cleaned her up a best they could, scrubbed her harness and leash, then left. Thing is; the poop covered dog was left loose in my house even though they know where her crate is. They left the poopy harness and leash on my kitchen counter. They used one of my dish brushes to scrub the leash and harness, then left it in one of the coffee mugs in my sink.

When I got home I lost it. I called my husband crying so hard I couldn’t even talk. He works 24 hour shifts and had to get coverage so he could come home. I have asthma so when I cry that hard it can sometimes trigger an asthma attack. We got her in the tub, he got in with her and got her as clean as we could for the night. They we started purging our house. Throwing away her harness, leash, collar, her bedding, her crate mat, the towels we used on her, our couch covers, the dish brushes, the offending coffee mug, and I don’t know what else. I also called our groomer in a panic and she came in early the next morning to groom her. 

I have spent close to $1000 recovering from this, including new locks for my front door because after I fire them I don’t even want them to come drop the keys off. I am going to be spending my weekend deep cleaning my house because I am convinced there is poop on everything. 

We’ve already engaged a new dog walker, she came today and met the girlie and took a walk with us and she can start Monday. She came recommended by our groomer. We’re also looking into daycare options. 

Where I need advice, I am very conflict avoidant. For my own mental health I plan on firing over text, mainly so I can get my thoughts out coherently and not have another breakdown. Some may say I should do it over the phone but I already know I can’t manage that. I’m just not sure the best way to go about this. Do I keep it short and say we won’t be utilizing there services anymore? Do I list the incidents out and tell them? Do I let them know how this affected me mentally? How much I’ve spent putting my house back together? How much is too much? 

I’ve never had my trust and space disrespected in such a huge way before and I’m just not sure how to go about this. If you made it this far, THANK YOU. ",1,1728083681.0,AutismInWomen,3,0.67,False

It’s a zine/artists/publishing event held annually every year. Creative people from around Hokkaido and Japan have tables selling zines, prints, postcards, magnets, art, whatever they make. It’s a massive DIY art show. 

There is boutique coffee and other cafe culture food available too.

The main event is on Sunday, with a limited version of the event on Saturday night (all tablers attend on Sunday, not everyone comes out for Saturday).

It’s completely free to attend, it’s family friendly, it’s not Aeon Town or Netflix. We all owe it to ourselves to leave the house for events that put in the effort.

1fwcl7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/1fwcl7e/small_business_job_hunting/,Small business job hunting,"Hello all!
I work overnights at a retail store and I’m usually out by 8:30-10am, just depends on what time I go in. I just need to work 8 hours from the time I go in. Usually I finish up early it’s more like 6 hours these days. With the holidays coming up I’ll probably be going back to my 8 hours. 

Anyways I’m looking for a second job at a small business. I’m more looking for a second job to interact more with people since I never see anyone (people are usually working when I’m free and I’m sleeping by evening time lol)

The reason Im specifically looking for a small business is because I don’t need any benefits, the pay isn’t really a big deal to me, I’m wanting short hours like 2-4 hour shifts, and only a few days a week. I’m also autistic so shorter shifts around a high stimulating area would be best. 

Im very reliable, don’t call in, have my own transportation, and know when I need time off 3-6 months in advance. I’m a very hard worker, with a strong sense of justice so I’m not usually messing around, and will look for work to do to pass time. I tend to be taken advantage of at bigger corporations but I’m learning boundaries lol. I learn things very quickly when it comes to labor work, but computer or admin work is my weakness. 

Im also looking for a more community based small business: for example curator coffee is a small business that supports other small businesses with vendor days or promoting them in their store. They even have a book swap there 😭

I would love to connect more with community based neighbors. 

As for location I’m looking anywhere between north, northeast, east, and upper central San Antonio. 

Umm I think that’s it.

Thank you for any suggestions and if I missed any necessary info feel free to ask!

A Guide to Stylish Mixing and Matching,"Gone are the days when living room furniture had to be a perfectly matched set straight out of a catalog. Today's interior design trends embrace a more personalized and eclectic approach, leaving many homeowners wondering: does living room furniture have to match? 

The short answer is no, but achieving a cohesive look while mixing furniture requires some know-how. 

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the art of combining different furniture pieces to create a stylish, unique living space that reflects your personality.

## Understanding the Basics of Living Room Design

### The Evolution of Interior Design Trends

Interior design has come a long way from the matchy-matchy aesthetics of the past. Today's trends celebrate individuality and personal style, encouraging homeowners to create spaces that tell their unique stories. This shift has opened up a world of possibilities for furniture selection and arrangement.

### The Case for Matching Furniture

While matching furniture sets can create a cohesive and put-together look, they can sometimes feel impersonal or lack character. However, there are still situations where matching pieces might be preferred, such as in formal living rooms or when aiming for a specific, uniform style.

### The Appeal of Eclectic Design

Eclectic design, which involves mixing different styles, periods, and textures, has gained popularity for its ability to create dynamic, interesting spaces. This approach allows for more creativity and self-expression in your living room decor.

## Key Elements to Consider When Mixing Furniture

### Color Coordination

When mixing furniture, color plays a crucial role in tying everything together. You don't need to stick to a single color, but establishing a cohesive color palette can help create harmony in your space. Consider using complementary colors or various shades of the same hue to create a unified look.

### Texture and Material Harmony

Mixing textures and materials can add depth and interest to your living room. Combine smooth surfaces with rough ones, or pair natural materials like wood with man-made materials like metal or glass. The key is to strike a balance that pleases the eye without overwhelming the senses.

### Scale and Proportion

Pay attention to the size of your furniture pieces in relation to each other and the room. Mixing furniture of different scales can create visual interest, but it's important to maintain a sense of balance. Avoid pairing extremely large pieces with very small ones, as this can make the room feel disjointed.

## Strategies for Successfully Mixing Living Room Furniture

### Establishing a Focal Point

Choose a standout piece to serve as the focal point of your living room. This could be a unique sofa, an eye-catching coffee table, or a striking piece of art. Use this focal point as a starting point for selecting other pieces that complement it.

### Creating Balance Through Repetition

Repetition of certain elements can help tie non-matching furniture together. This could be through recurring colors, shapes, or patterns. For example, if you have a blue armchair, you might incorporate blue throw pillows on a differently colored sofa to create a sense of cohesion.

### Using a Unifying Element

Introduce a unifying element that ties your diverse furniture pieces together. This could be a consistent color theme, a particular style of hardware, or even a recurring motif in your decor accessories.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Mixing Furniture

### Overcrowding the Space

One of the biggest pitfalls when mixing furniture is trying to incorporate too many different pieces. Remember that negative space is important in design. Give your furniture room to breathe and allow each piece to shine.

### Neglecting Functionality

While aesthetics are important, don't forget about functionality. Ensure that your furniture arrangement facilitates comfortable movement and serves the room's purpose, whether it's for entertaining, relaxing, or both.

### Ignoring the Room's Architecture

Take into account the architectural features of your living room when selecting and arranging furniture. Work with the room's layout, window placements, and any unique features like fireplaces or built-in shelving.

## Tips for Incorporating Different Styles

### Blending Modern and Traditional

Mixing modern and traditional styles can create a rich, layered look. Try pairing a classic Chesterfield sofa with sleek, contemporary side tables, or place a modern lamp on a vintage sideboard.

### Mixing Vintage and Contemporary Pieces

Incorporating vintage pieces into a contemporary setting can add character and depth to your living room. Look for vintage items with clean lines that can complement more modern furniture.

#### The 80/20 Rule in Design

When mixing styles, consider following the 80/20 rule: 80% of your furniture should be in one style, while 20% can be in a contrasting style. This helps maintain a cohesive look while still allowing for interesting variety.

## How to Shop for Non-Matching Furniture

### Starting with a Plan

Before you start shopping, have a clear idea of what you're looking for. Consider creating a mood board or collecting inspiration images to guide your choices.

### Embracing Gradual Acquisitions

Building a well-curated living room takes time. Don't feel pressured to furnish your entire space at once. Gradually acquiring pieces allows you to be more selective and find items that truly speak to you.

## The Impact of Accessories in Tying the Room Together

### The Role of Throw Pillows and Blankets

Accessories like throw pillows and blankets can play a crucial role in unifying diverse furniture pieces. Use these items to introduce complementary colors or to echo patterns found elsewhere in the room.

### Using Area Rugs to Unify the Space

A well-chosen area rug can tie together different furniture pieces and define the seating area. Look for a rug that incorporates colors from your various furniture items to create a cohesive look.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, living room furniture doesn't have to match to create a beautiful, harmonious space. By understanding key design principles and following the strategies outlined in this guide, you can confidently mix and match furniture to create a living room that's both stylish and uniquely yours. Remember, the most important thing is that your living room reflects your personal taste and meets your needs. So don't be afraid to experiment, have fun, and let your creativity shine through in your furniture choices.

## FAQs

1. **Can I mix wood tones in my living room furniture?**
   Yes, mixing wood tones can add depth and interest to your living room. Try to choose woods with similar undertones or use a unifying element like matching hardware to tie them together.

2. **How many different styles of furniture can I mix in one room?**
   While there's no hard and fast rule, it's generally best to limit yourself to 2-3 main styles to maintain a cohesive look. Use the 80/20 rule as a guideline.

3. **Is it okay to have mismatched sofas in the living room?**
   Absolutely! Mismatched sofas can add visual interest. Just ensure they complement each other in terms of scale and share some common element, like color or material.

4. **How can I make sure my eclectic furniture mix doesn't look cluttered?**
   Focus on maintaining a consistent color palette, leave plenty of negative space, and be selective about your pieces. Quality over quantity is key in eclectic design.

5. **Should my living room furniture match my dining room furniture if it's an open concept space?**
   While they don't need to match exactly, there should be some elements that tie the two spaces together, such as color scheme or style, to create a harmonious flow.",1,1728083129.0,HomeHacksHub,0,1.0,False

1fwcafd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1fwcafd/abnormal_heart_flutters_21f/,Abnormal heart flutters (21F) ,"I went to the emergency room today for a headache and lack of air coming through, along with chest pain and shots of pain in my left side where my heart is. It’s been going on for three months and I had finally mustered up the courage to go. I also finally received my first blood work. I’m 21 years old, female. Coming from a very secluded reservation, we did not have the opportunity to visit the nurses whenever something was wrong - we do not have access to one 24/7. My mom also abused us if we ever tried to make hospital visits, fearing we would tell on her about what’s been happening in our household. I have a large and immense fear of hospitals even though I have been out of her care due to her passing from addiction three years ago. 

I was ordered to have a CT scan, and X-rays along with blood work, the needle wasn’t as bad as I thought it was. I felt comfortable and they were very nice. They told me everything looked fine until they ran multiple EKGs. I do not take any substances or drink coffee, I only drink water and juices. I do not smoke, I do not do marijuana. I am not on any medication. 

My heart palpitations kept coming and going throughout the five hours I had waited there. My headache is dull and throbbing. Is something wrong with me? I was supposed to get referrals but I had a hard time understanding them and feeling nauseated. Was I supposed to receive papers? I don’t know what I was getting referrals for. They told me I was good to go home and I went home. It got pretty busy very fast and I felt like all that needed to be done, was done. I have slept the majority of the day since I got back. I am sweating lots. My headache is killing me. Light is very hard to have on. I just want to feel better as it is getting in the way of my studies. Thanks!

1fwc8fc,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1fwc8fc/time_looped_chapter_14/,[Time Looped] - Chapter 14,"Sebastian June was perfect for the role of school counselor. One look alone portrayed strength, care, understanding, and professionalism… or so Will had been told. He himself had only gone to see the man twice per year, as the principal demanded of every student. So far, the obligatory chats had been a complete waste of time. The general questions were basic and trivial, revolving in equal part around what the boy thought about his future, and issues he’d felt in his past. On one occasion he’d tried to go off script in an effort to make it difficult for the counselor, but Mister June had had ample experience dealing with Alex and others like him to take it in stride.

*Get ready.* A text popped up on his phone. *He’s on his way.*

Responding with a thumbs up reaction, Will set the phone to vibrate and put it away.

“Good luck at the shrink,” a group of seniors laughed as they passed by.

Will did his best not to pay attention. Normally, he would be in the small waiting room in front of the counselor’s office. The issue with that was since Mister June was the only person who had the key. Until he arrived, people had no choice but to stand in the corridor, becoming the target of everyone’s ridicule.

Given a choice, the boy would have popped in ten minutes later, especially since Helen was adamant that the first student to see him wouldn’t arrive until the start of next period. However, anyone would agree that standing there waiting gave off a sense of urgency.

“Err, Mister…?” the counselor asked as he approached his office.

“Stone,” Will said. “William Stone.”

“William Stone.” The man nodded with a smile, almost suggesting that he remembered who that was. “I take it you’re here to see me?”

“Yes. I tried earlier this morning, but it was locked.”

“Right, right. I had some traffic trouble. Well, let me just get a quick coffee and I’ll be right with you.”

“It’s about Danny… we were in the same class, so… I just didn’t know who to talk to.”

The counselor’s expression instantly changed. The smile was still there, but the corners of the mouth turned slightly down, suggesting that he wasn’t particularly happy to skip his morning—or mid-morning at this point—coffee, but knew where his duty lay.

“We better go inside.” He unlocked the door.

The waiting section was little more than a set of chairs in front of the office’s main door. They were marginally more comfortable than those in class. Switching keys, the counselor opened the inner door and invited Will inside.

“And what made you come to me?” he asked, putting his suit jacket on the only hanger in the room. While most schools prided themselves with the elegant casual look, the vice-principal had instead insisted that certain people of Enigma High had to “match their role.” Mister June was one of those select few.

“They’ve been repeating it all week since Danny’s death,” the boy replied.

“Right, right. Good choice. Good choice.”

*Don’t look around,* the boy told himself*. Don’t look around.*

Inadvertently, he did just that. Ignoring the plainness of the room, there were several large filing cabinets, most of them lockable. Above and around them were framed inspirational posters with generic quotes such as “today marks the first day of the rest of your life.” Whoever had come up with that clearly hadn’t experienced loops.

“You won’t find them there,” Mister June said casually.

“Find what?” The boy tensed up.

“My diplomas. School management insisted I have them, but I refused. This office is for people like you, not a room I could turn into my own trophy case.”

“Yeah.” Mentally, Will let out a sigh of relief. That was a bit too close.

“So, what’s worrying you?” The man held a paper notepad ready.

“Don’t you use a tablet for that?”

“Absolutely no. This is the best way to make sure that your data remains safe.”

“What if someone steals your notes?”

“That’s unlikely,” the man laughed. “Trust me, everything you share here is safe.”

“As safe as Daniel’s file? I heard that the contents of the folder are gone.”

The accusation quickly wiped off the smile on Mister June’s face. Initially, Will thought that he had caught him in a classical gotcha moment. Unfortunately, it quickly turned out not to be the case. The counselor was very touchy when it came to professional ethics and even a jokey accusation—not that this had been at all jokey—was enough to make him clam up and get the boy out of his office. Clearly, this wasn’t the way.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

“So, what’s worrying you?” The counselor asked.

“Before Danny killed himself, he told me that he felt trapped,” the boy tried a new approach. “As if he was reliving the same day over and over again.”

“I see.” The man jotted something down. “Were you two close?”

“No. I mean, not particularly at first.” Helen had texted him exactly what to say in order to get the best reaction. The key was not to get sidetracked again. “I think I mentioned I felt trapped during gym one day, so we got talking.”

“Interesting. He never mentioned it before.”

“Maybe he forgot?”

“I doubt it. He had a remarkable memory.”

*Oh well, here we go again.*

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

“I see. Were you two close?”

“Not particularly. He mentioned it once. I didn’t think much of it until he killed himself.”

“Daniel didn’t kill himself,” the counselor corrected. “What happened was a tragedy, an avoidable tragedy, but it wasn’t suicide.”

“That’s what everyone’s saying.”

“Look, Will,” the man put the notepad away. “This is school. Rumors are part of life. Exaggeration and lies are their own currency. When I say that it was avoidable, I meant that steps could have been taken to reduce his level of stress. The fact that you’ve come to see me is already a good sign.”

“I don’t feel it is.”

“I’m sure it feels like that. You probably feel that this whole place is like a prison that refuses to let you go. If you come here thinking that every day, of course, you won’t feel well. It’s like punishing yourself, then wondering why things are like they are.”

The conversation changed focus, according to plan. Now it was time for the second part.

“Umm, sorry, can I go to the bathroom for a bit?” the boy interrupted.

“Now?” the counselor arched his brows.

“It’s stupid, but… I want to be alone for a few minutes. Please.”

The explanation was such that a five-year-old wouldn’t fall for it. Yet, for someone who had gone through years of college, plus all the additional training programs, there was no way to say no. With an understanding smile, Mister June gave the boy a nod, then took his notepad again to jot his conclusions so far.

In the corridor, Will quickly took out his phone and sent Helen another thumbs up icon. This was the sign. Now all she had to do was climb to the second floor on the outside of the building without being seen and see exactly where the man put the file.  

No sooner had he done so than the phone rang. It was Helen.

*Huh?* “What happened?” the boy asked in a hushed voice. In his view, she was taking way too many chances. No wonder she had failed to get the file even after so many attempts.

“You were right,” Helen said. “He called the vice-principal.”

“So that’s where the files are kept?”

“Maybe. I’ll create a distraction. You get in the vice principal’s room and find it.”

That was the opposite of what the plan was supposed to be. Originally, he was supposed to be the distraction, and Helen had to trash up the counselor’s room and get the file.

“Are you sure?” he asked.

“It has to be in one of the two places. I’ll see where he puts your file and check the place. You go through the principal’s office.”

“Why don’t we do that next—” a faint sound told him that the conversation was over “—loop.”

Left with little choice, Will rushed along the corridor. He was almost certain that they’d fail, but that didn’t prevent him from giving his all. In the end, the loops were a means to gain experience in doing something. At the moment, their teamwork was highly disorganized. The plan was Helen’s. He was only playing a role in it. Regardless, all that mattered was finding the file. Once they did that, they had eternity to streamline the process.

As he reached the staircase, the unmistakable sound of shattering glass echoed from above. It sounded like two trucks carrying windows had crashed into one another. Sadly, Will knew that wasn’t the case. The sound had been burned into his mind for as long as he could remember.

*Did you have to call the wolves?* He ran faster.

Yells and screams soon followed. Helen had indeed been true to her word. This was a distraction the whole school would react to. The principal’s office was right in front of him, less than a few doors down the corridor. However, just as he neared it, the door handle turned down.

*Oh, crap!* Will leaped forward, sliding along the corridor.

The door opened, letting the vice-principal and the secretary rush out less than a split second after he had slid past. Not wanting to ruin his achievement, he quickly rolled to the side, hiding from view behind the door itself.

“What do you mean wolves?” the vice-principal yelled into her phone. “How can there be wolves?”

“I’m calling the police,” the school secretary said in a hushed voice, trying to keep up.

“Just go inside and close the door!” She glanced at the other woman beside her. “Yes. Frankly, I’ve no idea what you’re talking about. This better not be someone’s idea of a prank.”

Quietly standing up, Will made his way to the door, then, using his reflexes, slipped inside, closing and locking the door behind him. The action was likely noticed, but at this point, it didn’t matter. Fifteen minutes remained until the end of the loop. In that time, he had to find the location of their prize.

The desk was the usual choice to start. As usual, it was kept locked, but in her panic, the vice-principle had left the room leaving the keys behind.

*Score*, Will thought as he went through the drawers.

The first thing he found were the vice-principal's e-cigarettes. The woman clearly had a passion for them, for there were no less than five different ones, all filled up. Administrative documents filled the rest of the desk. The only things that stood out were a few transfer student printouts, and a half filled out expulsion form.

*Wow.* The boy paused for a moment, reading through the form. *Never knew you were about to get kicked out, Danny.*

Given the accusations listed, it wasn’t surprising. Apart from being described as disruptive, violent, and anti-social, one of the sections filled out stated that Mister June considered him a threat to himself and others. Interesting why he hadn’t mentioned that while Will was in his office.

The boy’s phone rang again.

“Hey,” he placed the phone between his head and shoulder as he went back to going through the last sections of the desk. “Found anything?”

“The binder’s empty, same as last time.”

“Well, I think my hunch was right. The harpy was about to expel Danny. There’s a note of June’s opinion, so she must have had the file to include it.”

“Expel? That’s impossible.”

“I’m looking at the papers right now. My guess is, if his loop had lasted a few more days, he would have been out of here.”

“That doesn’t make sense!”

“I’m just telling you what I saw.”

“I’m heading to you.”

“No! The door—” Will heard her end the call again “—is locked…”

*Why do I bother?* He thought.

With the desk fully rummaged, he quickly went to the cabinets containing the school files. Everything relating to a student went there, from student information to all their grades and teacher comments. With the opportunity presenting itself, Will gave into temptation and went through his own file. To his major disappointment, there was nothing particularly special there. His grades were okay and most of his teachers considered him smart but lazy.

Suddenly, the windows shattered. Fearing a wolf attack, the boy jumped away, grabbing the nearest object to use as a weapon.

“Chill, it’s me!” Helen said. Despite her dramatic entrance, not a single wound or scratch was visible. “Found anything?”

“I was just going through our files,” he said, only then glancing at what he was holding. As it turned out, it was a miniature Edgar Allan Poe bust.

“And?”

“You dropped in.” Leaving the bust in its place, the boy returned to the cabinet. “The expulsion papers are at the desk somewhere.”

Helen glanced at the desk, then at the file cabinet.

“I’ll check the desk,” she said.

“Sure.” He went back to searching through student files. “Why doesn’t anyone use computers here?”

“It’s Enigma High. What do you expect?”

“What’s his family name?”

“Keen,” the girl replied. She had found the document in question and was now reading and rereading it, as if trying to convince herself it was fake.

“Right, Keen.” Will continued rummaging.

*Kallan, Kackeron…* he tossed binders one after the other. *Keen.*

“Found it!” he said, waving it in the air. “Wow. His grades are really high.”

“That’s what happens when you’re in a loop.” The girl joined him. “When you’re bored in class, you just read ahead.”

Skimming through the general data, Will soon reached a yellow divider titled “Psychological – Copy”. It wasn’t what they originally had set out to find, but it had to do. Holding his breath, he turned the binder. Nothing followed.

“No!” Helen shouted in anger and annoyance.

*You must be kidding me!* Will thought. He flipped back to the beginning of the pages, then back again, as if hoping that the information had been misplaced.

“What if the cops took it?” he asked.

“His mother would have known. She was convinced it was still here.”

“Well, it’s clearly not. The only explanation is—” he stopped. There were several thin slivers of paper in the file behind the binder. “Look at this,” Will took them out. “Someone beat us to it.”

 

**Restarting eternity.**
