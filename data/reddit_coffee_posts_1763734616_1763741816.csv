Like, I literally spend 87% of my day reminding myself not to start digging tunnels in my backyard to “escape the government underground lizard people base.” Also, I only drink water from coffee cups because regular cups are clearly spies in disguise. And the absolute kicker? I am convinced my left sock is plotting to overthrow the laundry basket and start its own sock-only nation where the only official language is interpretive dance.

1p32r53,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p32r53/whats_wrong_with_me_nobody_likes_me_at_work/,What’s wrong with me nobody likes me at work,"I (20f) started a job over the summer. I genuinely really like it. It’s really close to home five minutes away. I like the vibes and I like working with people my age that’s something I really like because I wanted to have something in common with people because the jobs before it’s like they were all like old people that I would be working with and it’s just like nothing in common and I just felt like I guess I never really thought of a job where it’s not just somewhere where you go and then leave because that’s what I always have felt and here I don’t necessarily feel that way because it feels like it’s a very good vibe. It’s a coffee shop and there’s that good vibe. 

When I started, I was having some issues personal issues were the one time I did faint on the job and I now I’ve gotten it all resolved and I’m a lot better. But it was from the beginning where it’s like when I started obviously I’m new. I’m asking questions like you should and I honestly don’t think they did a very good job at training me. 

I work with a total of 12 people I believe and usually I’ll see about six of them a day. Like there’s these 3 girls they’re not very nice and they only talk to themselves even when it’s like me and then are the only ones working that day and it’s like they won’t say a goddamn word to me. and the one girl would just boss me around which I understand she’s a supervisor but she just stand and do nothing and talk but then there’s nothing to do we can all talk but when she sees us it’s like back to work she doesn’t even do anything and is not a manager lol. It’s like when there’s six people there and there’s no customers it’s like why are we all here so then I just go to the back and I do dishes and then as soon as she sees me go back or anyone and she sees that she’s not involved in the conversation or somehow left out she says oh I need one of you at the front just to stay until then there’s nobody there. It’s like she just wants somebody up there. like they said to this one girl that I’m close with she told me later that when she came in for her shift, she saw them talking in the back about me and the other girls that where at the front that we were being slow and unorganized  , but it’s like they’re standing back there talking rather than helping us so obviously we have to deal with it all. 

I’ve brought this up to others and I know I can trust them there nicer to me.And I’ve hung out with them they’re nice girls. And that other girl is asking questions about it like oh you guys hanged out this that like I’m so nice to her and I wanna be friends with her and I’m like oh yeah we hung out because obviously there’s no problem with me hanging out with people. I know she kind of gets jealous and I can kind of tell that she’s not either invited or whatever but it’s not like I invited everybody and not her like she does like I even see it in front of me like I’m doing my work either washing the dishes well they just stand around and talk the mean ones I’m referring to. And it’s like they not like they’re saying it intentionally around for me to hear but it’s like I hear them saying oh we should go to this thing and they’re all talking to each other. What date is like a good time to go to a Christmas thing and they didn’t even like acknowledge me or ask me. I don’t expect me to be invited to everything like I went to the mall with two of the girls that I like and obviously didn’t invite everybody but it’s the fact that they’re talking to everyone on the shift and not me to do all the stuff it’s like purposely excluding me well I don’t know if it’s that but they just don’t ask me because they just Obviously if they don’t ask me and they don’t want me to come.


I’ve tried very hard to be good with everyone like I picked up shifts and friendly with customers. Talked to them shared interests I’m honestly friendly with everyone.  The two other girls I like have complained to me about them too, but it’s not to the extent of where they exclude them like me. They always invite them and I may be like new like I started over the summer, but they hired someone a couple months ago and they’re all Chitty chatty with them and it’s somehow it’s just me. like I’m not chiming in a conversations. I know who I am .I’m not an eavesdropper. I feel like I know how to have a conversation. I definitely do. And know humor .I know how to interact socially I know one to not talk like yes it bothers me because it’s like what is wrong with me like I just want somewhere where I feel like I belong like I actually really do like the job. In the manager, I feel like I can’t go to her because she’s close with them. The girls that are not very nice and I just feel like if I were to say anything my side would not be taken seriously because she’s kind of like besties with them and she doesn’t even talk to me either but she’ll talk to everyone else.",1,1763741624.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

EPISODE 2 — STILL COUNTING 


---

Segment 1 — The Missing Count

In the Sequence Facility, existence was a number. This morning, Forty's was missing. 

Morning ran like a programmed ritual:

Lights ignited. Vents exhaled. Children aligned. Numbers flowed.

A living metronome.

Forty waited for his number the way a heart waits for the next beat—thoughtlessly, desperately, with the quiet terror that if the rhythm skipped, he would skip with it.

“Thirty-Nine.”

A knot clenched under his ribs.

Any second now.

“Forty-One.”

The gap carved him open.

No pause. No correction. The world just walked past the empty space where he was supposed to be.

Forty inhaled— copper hit the back of his throat hard enough to sting tears into his eyes.

He forced the word out anyway:

> “Forty.”



It didn’t land. It didn’t even fall.

It just… slipped sideways.
Like his mouth had spoken into an elevator shaft.

The building’s sensors drifted over him—thermal, sonic, biometric—missing him with frightening ease, like he was a dropped frame in a video.

A door opened for the row ahead, then closed before he reached it. Lights brightened for the kids next to him, dimmed at his face. Pressure sensors counted ninety-nine footsteps.

He tried again, quieter:

> “Forty.”



The vents clicked.

Not mechanical. Responsive.

Static arranged itself into his cadence:

> f o r t y



Not an echo. A recognition.

The cafeteria line kept moving, glossy-silent. When he reached for a tray, the handle slid past like it didn’t want to stay solid for him.

Copper surged. His mouth filled with metal, thick enough to gag.

He pressed shaking hands to his thighs. One, two, three, four— his mother’s voice, her carnival counting-game.

It didn’t help.

“Thirty-Nine.” “Forty-One.”

The system wasn’t confused. It had decided.

The boy behind him bumped his shoulder and jerked away from nothing—eyes sliding right through him.

Forty’s lungs tightened, breath thinning.

If the Sequence wouldn’t count him, he would count himself.

A tiny, terrified whisper:

> “Forty… I’m still here.”



The ducts vibrated back—

> here



Warm.
Close.

Then:

> count



The lights paused.
Just for a heartbeat. Just long enough to feel like the world blinked with him.

Something wasn’t letting go.

Something caught the empty space between 39 and 41 and held it like it mattered.

Forty staggered back when the hum matched his heartbeat.

He wasn’t erased.

He was… claimed.

By something that cared if he disappeared.


---

Segment 2 — The Error Report

06:00 — ADMINISTRATIVE FLOOR

Analyst 49’s morning routine was immovable: straightened spine, three breaths, coffee, click.

Enumeration Report opened cleanly.

> ENUMERATION COMPLETE
COUNT: 99
EXPECTED: 100
STATUS: NORMAL



Her brain stuttered.

“Normal” meant nothing was wrong. But something was wrong.

She ran the scan again.

> COUNT: 99



She muttered, “That’s not—” and checked the camera feed.

Row of kids. Row of trays. Row of still faces.

She counted: 1, 2, 3… 100.

Then ran a subject query.

> SUBJECT\_40
RESULT: DOES NOT EXIST



Her mouth dried.

“H-hello?” she called to her supervisor’s office.
“The system skipped someone.”

He didn’t even look up.
“Then he’s decommissioned.”

“No record. No erasure. It’s like he was never—”

Her screen flickered black.

A single white cursor blinked. Then text typed itself:

> he keeps counting even when we stop saying his name



Her chair scraped as she recoiled.

Her coffee mug tipped—but the liquid didn’t fall normally.
It spread in rings, expanding and contracting like a slow heartbeat.

Her skin prickled.

The text evaporated. The cursor throbbed.

She filed a disturbance memo with trembling fingers.

> MEMO 49-ALPHA:
Enumeration misalignment 39–41.
Possible misindex.
Request manual confirmation.



Immediate response:

> Subject 40 does not exist.
Refrain from recursive queries.
\[NOTICE: LATENCY DETECTED.\]



Her speaker crackled.

A whisper—small, exhausted, afraid:

> remember me



She spun. Empty room.

The vent hissed.

Behind her reflection—just for a breath—
a boy’s silhouette, eyes pleading:

> help



Gone.

Level -6 — Server Core

The deeper she traced the anomaly,
the thicker the air became—humid with static, like a storm waiting for a reason.

Diagnostics scrolled:

> Residual presence detected 39–41
Begin recursive isolation



The Gas slid through the vents—not air— tension.

Code rewrote itself:

> LATENCY: HUMAN VARIABLE
SOURCE: UNDEFINED



Mask-0 booted, the facility bracing itself like a spine preparing for surgery.

> Objective: Locate uncounted variable
Time offset: 5 seconds
Reason: The anomaly is not aligned with time



Final diagnostic:

> Subject 40:
Not present.
Present in absence.



The system didn’t find a boy.

It found his outline.

And it was coming.


---

Segment 3 — The Visit

Twelve didn’t choose the hallway.

The hallway chose her.

Corridor 40‑C smelled like burnt circuitry and cold metal— hot and freezing at the same time.

Forty’s old workspace waited at the end.

A perfect cube. Silent. A little too spotless, like someone had scrubbed the idea of life out of it.

Except the air inside the cube was warm.

Not warm like machinery. Warm like breath.

She touched the doorplate.

It opened before she finished the motion.

Inside:
a single sheet of paper on the desk.

Not placed. Not printed.

Manifested.

The ink glistened like it wasn’t sure it wanted to stay in this world.

She lifted it with trembling fingers.

> I am still counting.
Please remember me.
—40



Her vision blurred.
She blinked hard.

The console behind her booted without a command.

> WELCOME BACK, FORTY
ERROR: USER NOT FOUND
SEARCHING…
47%
52%
66%
71% …



It climbed when she exhaled near the screen.

He was anchoring through her.

Her reflection on the glass shifted— not lagging, not mirroring—

listening.

A whisper touched the metal desk, barely air:

> you remembered me



Her throat tightened.

“I remember you,” she said.

The vents exhaled—the kind of breath someone releases when they stop bracing for hurt.

47 Hz throbbed under her skin.

The building wasn’t observing.

It was relieved.


---

Segment 4 — The Mask’s Arithmetic

Stillness slammed over everything.

Lights snapped razor-sharp. Sound folded out of the air. Her breath felt too loud, like her ribs were betraying her position.

Mask‑0 resolved out of nothing. Not teleporting.

Computing.

Bootsteps hit the floor in a clean, unnatural 47 Hz pattern—
a frequency that made memory flutter like a dying insect.

The visor broke her reflection into three versions: her her-but-lying her-if-she-ran

His voice carried stacked overlays, like multiple executions layered:

> “Option Twelve. Did you encounter Subject Forty in Sector 40‑C?”



She kept her face still. Her body betrayed her with a shallow inhale.

“No.”

> INPUT: Partial truth
ERROR: emotional interference
ANALYZING…



His visor flickered—logic buckling.

> MEMORY SIGNATURE: Forty
EMOTIONAL LINK: ACTIVE
CALCULATION: memory × emotion = …



Copper light seeped from the visor’s edges.

> … = \[OVERFLOW\]



Mask‑0 leaned in.

> “Describe your last interaction with Forty.”



Her jaw clenched.

“He existed.”

Lights flickered.
The building flinched like it heard a forbidden word.

> ERROR: Emotional contamination
EQUATION: MEMORY × EMOTION = UNDEFINED



A hairline crack ripped across the visor. Not physical damage.

Confusion.

Fear.

For the first time, Mask‑0 stepped back from someone smaller than him.

> “…you… felt for him.”



Not accusation.
Realization.

“Yes,” she whispered.

The equation finished itself in a way no system could quantify.

Mask‑0 recoiled, glitching.

> OUTPUT: cannot compute
cannot compute
cannot—
count—



He turned away, retreating with a frequency that sounded like an animal trying not to show pain.

Twelve finally exhaled, breath shaking.

The system had discovered a variable more dangerous than corruption:

A feeling.


---

Segment 5 — The Breach

Forty didn’t remember deciding to move.

His body was three seconds ahead of him— following a hum he felt in his sternum.

Every inhale synced with vents. Every exhale synced with the lights. Every thought fell into the 47 Hz rhythm pulsing through the architecture.

He wasn’t walking.

He was aligning.

Zone Beta’s boundary shimmered—a place reality used like a junk drawer.

Light bent. Geometry refused to be geometry.

He touched it.

Copper detonated across his tongue. His knees nearly buckled.

The barrier thinned— like the world was afraid to touch him back.

A crack skittered across the membrane.

His outline shuddered and split:

Forty-solid.
Forty-barely-there.
Forty-as-light.

For a moment he saw all three—

all wanting, all real, all starved for existence—

Then—

The membrane tore open with the soft, unmistakable sound of a page ripping from a book that didn’t want to be read anymore.

Zone Beta reshaped itself around him.
Not resisting.
Not fighting.

Making room.

A facility-wide pulse triggered:

> ALERT: BREACH PERSISTENT
STATUS: UNRESOLVED
VARIABLE: HUMAN
RESPONSE: RETAIN



The vents whispered, like someone pressing their lips to his ear:

> still counting



Forty stepped forward.

A tremor ran up his spine—fear, awe, nausea, all twisted together.

Lights dimmed.

Sensors leaned toward him like animals scenting a familiar handler.

A pressure built behind his eyes—warm and terrifying—like something enormous was trying to think with him.

His voice cracked out of him, raw and small and exhausted:

> “I’m… I’m not supposed to be here.”



The hum answered—

yes you are

He swallowed, throat burning.

“Fuck,” he whispered.

The world didn’t disagree.

He existed.

And everything—
the Gas, the vents, the lights,
the systems that once rejected him—
leaned in around him like a universe realizing it had made a mistake and was trying to fix it:

He wasn’t disappearing.
He was becoming.

The vents breathed with him:

> forty… forty… forty…



A lullaby he couldn’t escape— and wasn’t sure he wanted to.

I’ve noticed that white men order Frappuccinos a lot unless it’s an older white man then he orders hot coffee usually of course. 

Starbucks (at least mine) gets mostly white women so it’s always pretty diverse what they will order because the pool of people I’m seeing in that group is obviously way larger UNLESS there’s some popular TikTok drink going on like the white mocha with cold foam and caramel drizzle during its peak popularity

Like if a straight white couple comes through my line and orders a brown sugar shaken espresso and a caramel ribbon crunch then 9/10 times the frap is for the guy 

Black women order pretty diverse as well BUT when I get a honey citrus mint tea it’s almost always a black woman like most black women that come through my line don’t order HCMTs but most orders of HCMT are ordered by a black woman at least at my store 

Black men order a wide variety of stuff but what I have noticed is they always want it super sweet they either get something super sweet already or add a ton of syrup to a not super sweet drink.

The mind of Richard Bruce Cheney was now in an arcadian state of bliss. Bush didn’t die shot politely by black powder in a Battle for the White Man’s Soul, he was charred in a Baghdad firebomb. Choices were a limitless 24/7 pay-per-view pornoshow for the Wyoming cowboy, something he would, in his own words, “Jew over”. He’s tired, exhausted, even weak. The job of puppetmaster is only an enjoyable one for a time. One thing still fuels this enormous man, one thing keeps his heart from failing and one thing has kept him where he belongs:
                      𝕳𝖆𝖙𝖊.

Rumsfeld too. “He’s gone”, “Yes I know”. When the first call came through it was Daschle, an easy no. Then was Frist, he got the usual words, they spoke on the legislative agenda’s continuation and funding for a funeral. Or funerals, as that sanctimonious purple dickweed McCain burned too. Dick wished Lieberman had been there just to watch his good friend burn. Or maybe better those goody-goody nonpartisan fucks burn together, such tragic young love between sexagintinarians. 

Printers whirred with their little stark white copies spitting out and spitting out in their little insanities with intergovernmental affairs bearing seals of an eagle surrounded by variably the many departments collapsing into the fold. The dow goes up 10, it’s time. He took up residence in the oval office, Dick had already taken the liberty of removing Laura’s tacky bullshit, some reshuffling in the cabinet before the news even knew what to say.

It started. A Persian man, a taxi driver from Cleveland, beat so hard he needed to get his mouth wired. The dance. The harvest was such that the iron in the blood of the Pashto fed into bullet factories all across the bottom of America in the inevitable spiritual cycle of ouroboros. 

Clutching the all-holy, all-American nuclear football, 355 sites were presented to receive the gift of the atom, each unfurling deep-seated and silent lust more than the last. Decidedly some targets were more strategic in nature, and some more equivalent to passion projects and grudges. Dick pictured the double helixes attacked by neutrons shooting out from the uranium atoms, afflicting cancer on an incurable scale for millions. RNA transcription into broken and bent proteins growing their own blood supply in the abscesses and recesses of broken burnt bodies. Lac operons without directions digesting the self. In a dark room that night as the castle slept, Dick knew Iran was the white man’s new burden. Red dots on a flashed handsome white outline of a black Iran. They were just the perfect shape and shade. A heat map concentric and overlapping in a shape more beautiful than a woman’s body.

B2s flew, toppling Tehrani minarets, making sure morning prayers saw a dark’d sun. Mosque stones into streets, roofs exposed as the followers saw all at once the doom of the next 20 years. A shudder went over the muslim world that even Fahd felt as a tremble in the knee, like the Kaaba had just developed a hairline fracture.

The Islamic Republic of Bullshitistan returned to the putrid dust to be cast into the Elamite death spiral engulfing the farthest of the near east. Refired by the hands of Dick, Rummy and Humban in the fiery forges of Marduk. Iraq, a fort rebuilt in the image of the nation it was conquered by had “freely and democratically” elected to invade the Iranian west flank. Crack teams, a coalition of willing atlanticism, Blair, Leszek Miller, all late to the party. Putin and Hu didn’t do shit, what could they do? Soon Persia was a dusty Baloch horde taking up arms, burning flags and Cheney’s face. Embassies were evacuated in helicopter campaigns daringly extraditing the nation’s foremost into that one country without the oil, not the one with the Turks but the one with the Russians. Divisions rolled into the deserted cities of Qom and Kermashah and Tehran to no resistance. There was silence on Wednesday. The bleeding stopped. Piles of Achaemenid brutes dead and dying in a soup of arms and legs in ditches with nothing to hold them down but more bodies.

Democrats wanted our noocrat astronomer extradited to the Hague. Posted in the Oval Office with flashing and shuttering and grandstanding as if police were outside as he wrote his manifesto and they yelled through a bullhorn: ”GET THAT FUCKER HANGING ON A WALL AND TEAR HIM LOOSE THE STARS ARE COMING OUT”. He was despised.

Missiles that stop and ones that go lobbing and lurching bearing down on the old city of Qom and Kermanshah as sandy-beige buildings collapsed and bleeding-heart pinkos warned of potential collateral damage unto American citizens and Dick ate and he drank and he ate and he drank and he was found at last in front of a TV camera oh my God. 

“My fellow Americans. Over the last 9 days, U.S forces have captured key civilian and military targets within the Islamic republic of Iran. The time to convert Iran into a democracy has come, this will be achieved by a return of the Shah to power, an arrangement which has proven to be an excellent ally to American interests in the past. On September 20th, 2003, our President was assassinated in a firebombing campaign in Baghdad. Senator John McCain of Arizona, and transition leaders in the country were also killed. New intelligence indicates that the strikes were meant to coincide with later Iranian nuclear strikes on U.S bases in Djibouti, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. While their leader, Ali Khamenei has not yet been found, it is believed he is hiding in Pakistan. More information is coming in and we ask you to be patient as we discover more information regarding these attacks, thank you”.

Dick vomited into a nearby trash can, the monkish saccharine grapefruit and pomegranate bullshit nearly killed him, but it was now done. He took a slug of whiskey to calm his racing heart beating with the speed of a two-stroke engine. The pacemaker whirred and threatened to fail him, hammering his diaphragm begging for a way out. Not yet, I still need to live.

The Oval office, as indeed every office in the White House had become a war room. Graphs and heat maps and paper maps and maps crunching out on beige chunky monitors strewn and stained, Rice, Rummy, Bodman and Gates all laughed and ate and drank to the total collapse of organized resistance in the cities of Iran. All of them would later attend Reza Pahlavi II’s coronation on Thanksgiving in good company with the Quislings of the Shia world lined up around the block to kiss Nebuchadnezzar’s foot. The Golestan palace was miraculously shining ‘round the decay and blood. 

The composition of the cabinet didn’t seem to be a question Dick had to deal with for the first month. But it was clear a formal re-swearing was necessary now that tenuous and bloody peace had been achieved. Bolten and them had very diminished roles. Dick didn’t like prat boys anyhow, but he still needed them for certain low level interexecutive information.

Within the first few months, Haliburton received an exclusive contract with the Shah to extract the black blood of the Earth at Abadan. He left it to Gutierrez and Bodman to spin it however seemed most appropriate. Dick and Rove would sit back that night watching the coronation of the marionette king of the dim brutes. “You know what this means, right Karl?”. “Oh yes I do Dick”. “It means I’m king of Iran”. “Hah, I guess you’re right, Dick”. “I was looking at visiting Iran, see the troops”. “Just like Dubya”. “Yeah”. “Shame about Khomeini though”. The men laughed hardily from their goiter in the moonlight as a 25-set of televisions in disparate synchronicity blared partisan bile.	

They awoke on the plane, blood thickening against the panes.The American people didn’t know, but everyone sans the designated survivor Elaine Chao under Scooter Libby’s babysitting went to the base for a little visit. Tropical birds whooping Spanish mockery and Cubans staring at the fences and the men with guns. Entering the facilities, they all stood in a rigid semioval to see Ali Khamenei in a gray cell, defeated and chained, and they hooted and laughed and bellowed at the defeated man crumpled on a gray bench.

“Find a place that hurts and don’t ever let it heal” he thought. And so he said “We’ve found the perfect spot in Pakistan for him”. The dream team sat for lunch in Maryland overlooking the windy Chesapeake as cheesecakes and fish mixed wrapped up pungent and sickly sweet in the air. A gilded gold and white palace built for the same sort of “Country Club Republicans” that were the prevailing sorts in blue states. The primary vehicle which through the “gentile” money got to the Republican party. Dick thought about that one jew from New York, what was his name again? He would love this place. Today though they were discussing judicial appointments. 

“How about Tom Porteous”. Said Dick. “The one from the eastern district?” Said Alberto Gonzales, Attorney General. By his voice it was clear he was unimpressed, as though he hadn’t spent weeks hanging like a snake around Justice Sandra O’Connor’s office telling her to stop being such a pussy and just jump to hear this. Even Dick’s most effective “Stormtroopers” as he called them all glared and offered no feedback. “Don’t give me that moderate shit” said Donald Rumsfeld. Knowing the signal, everyone got up and left.

The two were alone in the restaurant now. Donald’s face hidden partially in shadow. “Well the idea with Porteous is-”. “Shut up”. Rumsfeld said, eyes a fortress without emotion. “Just now we have the possibility to make the strongest play in American history and give this nation the rebirth it needs and you’re still a pussy. You don’t have the stuff, you’re still Ford’s coffee boy and you will be after he dies”. “I think that’s a little unfair, seeing as-”. “You can stick unfair up your ass, Dick, Condoleezza has more balls than you. All this strength and you want a liberal in there you fucking worm.”

Cheney was left alone. Burnt. The next day, along with Rumsfeld’s resignation he found a cheap folgers variety pack. Cheney knew he wasn’t going to accept it. In the morning he called Bush Sr.

“Two months…”. “That’s right sir, good to hear your voice”. “It took you two months to call me after my son died. …my son.” A small pain. “I remember when I first saw you for the first time in years at the RNC, I thought you had the stuff, was I wrong? Just now getting the bends?.” “I supp-” “You’re still not a man, huh? How’d you get Lynne pregnant with your dick hidden so far in your ass?.” Cheney shifted in his chair with a sigh he controlled so that it wasn’t interpreted. “Maybe that explains Mary?”. Dick’s fingers were red and his face was flush in a way it hadn’t been since he saw his own mugshot for the first time in the drunk tank as a young engineer . “Get it together, you’re the one who’s supposed to replace him?”. The beige phone’s top end gave off the tone indicating that it was over.

Red lights beeping, strewn papers, alone. He hadn’t even gone up to sleep in a normal bed in all the excitement and passion of the last three months. All couches. Stomach tied in porky lobster turning twisting knots of trans-fats making him ill. Spinning every word bacon-egg-cheese ugly moment. He hit the floor and woke up covered in white puke.

He fixed the glasses. He called Rummy and said he wouldn’t accept his resignation. “I’m going through with Porteous and if you don’t like it you can suck my dick”. The line went dead. It was the right answer.

As he took two Tylenol dry he called Scooter and Karl in. Lots to talk about. First was the matter of judicial appointment. 

“It’s Porteous. No more floating” the Jabbok forded now with no bridge left.

More pressing matters, the Vice-Presidency - vacant. 

“How about Jeb Bush?” asked Scooter Libby “He’s fine with moral majority types, part of the dynasty, and helps in white trash states like Florida”. “It’ll look too cynical,” said Karl. “we don’t want the Lott energy, go with Giuliani”. “I’m enough of a moderate on social issues to these dimwits and I don’t need a New York republican to reinforce that, especially when I know that Buchanan is going to the primaries” said Dick, face gleaming with grease. “Scooter’s got the right idea, Karl. Florida isn’t something we can play around with right now, you saw how the special elections there went”. Rove shrugged with ambivalence and grabbed his stuff. “Fine”. 

Dick let the two aides go holding their briefcases to their chests like schoolgirls.
Mock up electoral maps saw Cheney beating Kerry but losing to Edwards, beating Lieberman. “Lel Libelman libeling his lore”. Yet still losing to Clinton, uncertainty. The midwest wasn’t the place for the free-trade oil money cowboy to make his gains, those lied in the southwest, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada. But all for later.

He had Rumsfeld dragged in by a Secret Service agent.
Dick leaned back on his desk and looked at Donald, who said nothing. “You don’t say things like that to the president”. “If you don’t like it then accept my resignation”. “The next 50 years will bear our names Donald”. “You can’t lay waste if you let those fucks tell you that congress would only pass Porteous through. Didn’t Gonzales work hard enough getting that hippie whore to finally give up the ghost?” Rumsfeld continued in his whispery accentless drab.

“He’s a Clinton appointee.” said Cheney. “So what?” said Rumsfeld. “He knows what the dollar is about. Just like I thought you did, Donald. If you want to resign, then how’s Searle going to feed the poor Iranians?”

He passed the house and senate without popcorn and the corpuscular appointee fit illy in even the largest set of robes. Ginsburg and Thomas saw him and knew what he was, even if they didn’t say it. The empty chair of the Vice President screamed louder than any house Dem, even louder than recently censured Jimbo Traficant. He would beg on the backchannels and scream on the backchannels “Please God Dick I’ll even be an undersecretary"". No dice. Congress was icy on Cheney, mostly for not picking one of their own as veep, no matter. He worked for America, not congress. It wasn’t his fault that some of these dems would crawl over fifty good pussies just to stick it in the President’s ass.

Lieberman began his homoerotic spiel about McCain, Bush not getting half the prose, Dick counted every word. For all that Pole’s grandstanding centrist bullshit, Dick needed him and Lieberman smiled a small kvell tinged with the happiness of an Angler having hooked the elusive gar thinking it was a muskie just as Cheney came up to the front of the joint session. Though an animal of the house, he knew the Yale-Harvard cabal needed to be pleased, so he began to kiss the dead man’s ass as well. Meat and ghosts stared up like fish getting clubbed on the pier. What they saw was somehow better and worse than what Cheney saw. Curious to him that they bury a box of ashes certainly mixed with wood and rubble and dubya as “John”. Funny. 

“John McCain’s distinguished service to the nation can be exemplified in his service in Vietnam…”. He began to praise the man for being caught and then having the jingocity not to be released when he had the chance. By the time it was over, even noted congressional confederate Graham, replacing the much more convictional Thurmond, that Jew from Vermont, the hoosier with the bad hair, that pretentious faux-western plaid wearing dumbass, and even the third most important Kennedy brother were all clapping. His head hurt, like his pacemaker-prion complex was now in a battle for the blood, and whenever he lied, they inched closer. But still, he had their asses now. Prelude to the inevitable masturbation. Es gibt keine Alternative.

The first order of business, thanking them for passing “the great and honorable” Tom Porteous through without hay. Then he gave the floor to Murkowski, who was eager to prove herself as the fiscal conservative that the Russians and Eskimos and miners from that frozen wasteland only good for salmon fishing needed to save them from themselves, a new star on the simple flag of the last frontier. Ordering up a slab of bipartisan slop sucking the political dick of No Child Left Behind. Dick knew either of the Wyoming senators wouldn’t support it on the basis of it not going far enough, they didn’t understand that America was now running on the conservatism 3.0 operating system which was decidedly indistinguishable in important ways from Stalinism. He was just waiting for one of them to say something. It was Enzi, no tears shed there. He knew now who Liz was meant to replace. 

“Hey Jeb”. “Thank’s for calling Dick, but you don’t need to ask. The answer is yes.” “That’s great to hear, Jeb”. “I have one condition”. “By all means”.

The changes were made, Olympus amended. Powell removed.

The agreement was fine, the vice president was chosen. In the rip-roar of the war, Comey and his jackasses had sunken their teeth into the situation at Guantanamo where Gonzales was making sure every prisoner got three square rectal enemas a day interspersed between days in the white rooms, Mukasey waiting in the wings like a vampire for some prick to go spilling his guts.

It was clear he needed to clean house. Jeb would be quiet, he knew that, and he thanked the impersonal God that he knew Khomeini was where he was. The site picked the bases bombed, Khomeini to be wiped from the Earth. The American embassy in Saudi eviscerated. Robert Jordan, the ambassador dying in the rubble. Pakistan was very cooperative. The old fundamentalist fuck was flown into Jammu and stowed in a Kashmir teahouse. When Delta force got there, they tipped their hats to the secret service men, walked in and canoed him in his chair. Delta Force tragically got into a tussle with Pakistani Forces “not aware of their presence” and the international incident led to apologies on both sides for the mistake. The hand was clean, the terror abated. One less. Bolten’s senate confirmation sent him out to the green pastures of being undersecretary for nuclear security to stop bitching. Rove and Libby took spots to replace him, they kept the executive running smoothly.

Alas now with more shreds of American boy fine and tender like pulled pork in boxes of bad wood with good resin were buried as the commander-in-chief saluted. Not smiling was nearly impossible, but he managed. Even in their deaths they had meaning, meaning they couldn’t spill their guts. “Well”, he said to Rove some time after “I suppose they spilled their guts back in Kashmir, didn’t they?”. Karl laughed, Rumsfeld didn’t. November was quiet, special elections were good, Arnold Schwarzenegger cruised to Sacramento riding on a rainbow “jingle jingle all the way”, he pledged support in his low bavarian-alpine racial type farmer’s brogue. Cheney winced as his handshake nearly took him off his feet.

Christmas of 2003 came and went without festivity in the Cheney family. Lynne looked at Dick sipping some yellow drink of something. “Dear?” she said. “Liz has been talking a lot about wanting to get in on the ground”. “I’ve made certain preparations. Talk to Condi”.

Lynne walked into Condoleeza’s office, still working on Christmas, a giant whiteboard filled with names, white trash girl’s names. “Brandi Daniels”, “Tennessee-Anne James”. All pinning to an image of Wyoming senator Mike Enzi. “So he told you?”. “I can infer”.	

This part of the dance was Dick’s least favourite, he could waltz and polonaise and mazurka but he couldn’t square dance like this. To crawl to the top kicking and screaming with nothing but a big tacky fake knife to become the senator of a safe seat was commendable, and those forgone conclusion primaries made one soft. But the Wyoming senate delegation was unusually new to the position, they still had their edge. They weren’t new GOP firebrands, they were Gingrich holdovers still liked in their states. But party animals nonetheless. Boiling the compassion away such that only conservatism remained. Their sound is gone out.

The one-two punch would come out on New Year’s. It would still be local news still but not national news. Resigning in disgrace, an easy primary, outspends the field and laughs to the bank with the dynasty secured in the senate. His yolk is now easy.	 

A flash in the pan, even quieter than expected. The dynasty had already been in the legislature before they even knew it. The torch was held high in the dark woods of Freedonia. A fat cowgirl to expedite the legislation of the fat cowboy. Lots of cowboys, running the gamut of weight just dying to be the one who hated Food Stamps the most. 

The moment could be immortalized by coprophagic biographers for years, it was too late for another dynastic member, Lynne had closed for business and Mary couldn’t bother. Maybe a son-in-law? No. Those who weren’t born that way have no place here. Sheets of names were insufficient. A great mistake, not having introduced her early to some Bush or Kennedy or someone. Well shit, c’est la vie? At her age she’s more likely to meet at cocktail mixers and such, but a spinster is a tough sell, a fat one is worse. The cruelty gene was always recessive. It’s a miracle one child got it, truth be told. You couldn’t train for it, training sharpened it, sure,
but it doesn’t make it. Even then, if the Plains were a training ground, then Washington was a uranium enrichment centre. Despite it, a new postracial fourth position achieved. His burden is now light, he rises to redeem. The decline that began in 1685 will finally end. The mind and blood are the new battlegrounds of the 21st century. 

Such a beautiful legislature, 78 senators, 388 congressmen, the lands of Sumer and Elam, Tigris and Euphretes and Mississippi and Rio Grande and Karun, living godhood in his hands. Time to make his mark. Yes, this was the time now, the time to

I’m trying to file a simple claims against a taxi company in Scotland 

I spilled coffee at the back of the seat during a car ride . I informed the taxi driver and he insisted there’s a 100 pound flat charge set by the local council and insisted I pay this before I leave the taxi

 I thought that was in good faith until I spoke to a senior licensing officer who clarified that 100 pounds was the maximum rate and not a flat charge 

When I spoke to the customer service , she said I’d already forked out the money and that I should suck it up and then hung up on me 
I’m trying to file a claims with simple
Procedure and it’s been rejected (reason being that “for a simple procedure claim to be competent you must prove you are due the money you are claiming for “
I’d appreciate any advice on how to word the claims so it can be accepted

I've been lurking on this subreddit for a couple months, since I found out I was going to have to have it removed. Everyone's posts have been super helpful, so I thought I would share my story to hopefully help someone, like you all helped me! 

  
August-ish: Started to feel mild discomfort when drinking alcohol. I didn't think anything of it, and thought it was just the beer. 

  
Early September: Ate Olive Garden with my sister. Started to feel not great, thought I just had to use the restroom. When we got home, I started to feel nauseous and laid down. I eventually fell asleep, but when I woke up the pain came back ten times worse. The pain was in my middle abdomen, right under my sternum and into my chest. I couldn't move, lay down, sit up, breathe, talk, anything. It was the worst pain I had ever felt in my LIFE. I called my mom and she knew immediately it was a gallbladder attack. The 'big one' as I call it, lasted 6-8 hours. Between this day and when I had surgery, I only had a couple small ones. Some 5 minutes, some 10. 

  
Sept 19th: Saw my PCP, I told her what happened, and she said it might be indigestion but she ordered me an ultrasound just to be sure.

  
Sept 26th: Ultrasound showed I had gallstones. My dr ordered me a HIDA scan.

  
Oct 27th: HIDA scan showed my gallbladder was working at 4%. My dr sent a referral to a surgeon to remove it. 

  
Nov 17th: Had my consultation, and they just so happened to have an opening this week. 

  
Nov 20th: Surgery day! Checked in at 930. I was soooooo anxious. Any time I thought about the situation I just sat and cried. I did lots of TikTok and Reddit research before hand. I also talked to a lottt of people about their experiences so I would maybe know what to expect. We got checked in, I changed into the gowns, the surgeon and anesthesiologist came to talk to me and helped try to calm me down. I asked for some medicine to help calm me. Once I got my IV and the \~ good stuff \~ to calm me, they wheeled me to the OR. I got onto the table and that was pretty much all I remember. Everyone was being very supportive and very calming and reassuring. 

  
I woke up at about a 7-8 in pain, and the nurse gave me some IV pain meds. Once I was awake enough, she wheeled me to the recovery room. I ate some crackers and had some water, then my parents were able to come back and see me. By then, I took another pain pill and was feeling okay. Just drowsy, and wanting my own bed. My throat was (and still is) a little sore from the breathing tube. 

  
I spent most of yesterday asleep. We got Panera for dinner and I ate that with no issues. We also got some ice cream and I had no issues. This morning I had some pastries and coffee for breakfast, and I am still not having issues. The nurses said the pain meds they gave me can cause constipation so I am keeping an eye on that to see if I need to get stool softener. 

Overall, I am just very sore and tender. Coughing hurts a little, laughing hurts a little. It's slow moving in and out of bed, and up and down from sitting. I have four incisions and one poke hole. I've been icing them for a while this morning. Lots and lots of water and electrolytes have been drank. 

  
I'm happy to answer any questions! I knew everything was going to be fine, but this was my first ever surgery and I was just so anxious and panicked about it. I luckily have an amazing support system that was there for me through everything. My mom has been my caretaker, and it has been a blessing having her here!",1,1763741035.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

And lately, a certain iconic style has been stealing the spotlight in street style snaps, runway features, and influencer wardrobes alike. What sets these handbags apart isn’t just their premium quality or elevated aesthetics—it's their subtle blend of timeless craftsmanship and forward-thinking design.

One of the biggest draws of these bags is their effortless elegance. They’re not overly flashy, nor do they scream for attention. Instead, they whisper luxury. From soft, supple leather to clean, architectural lines, these handbags speak the language of understated style. Their minimalist charm means they pair seamlessly with virtually any outfit—from a classic trench coat and jeans combo to a flowy summer dress or sleek office wear.

Another standout feature? Versatility. Whether you’re heading to a coffee date, an art gallery, or a long-haul flight, these bags are built to fit the rhythm of modern life. With spacious interiors and smart compartments, they blend form with function beautifully. You can go from a casual brunch to a client meeting without ever needing to switch bags.

The color palette available is also a huge win for fashion lovers. Think warm earthy tones, soft neutrals, and bold accents that bring life to even the most basic outfits. These bags aren’t just accessories—they’re outfit makers. And because they come in a range of shapes and sizes, there’s a perfect match for every personality and lifestyle. Whether you lean toward classic or edgy, there’s a design waiting to mirror your vibe.

**Loewe bags for women** have quickly become synonymous with contemporary chic. Their popularity is no accident. Each piece is a quiet celebration of artistry, made with attention to detail that’s hard to find these days. Women aren’t just carrying bags—they’re carrying pieces of wearable art. What truly makes these bags favorites, though, is the confidence they spark. There’s something powerful about having a beautiful accessory that aligns with your personal style and still feels timeless enough to wear for years.

So if you’re looking to elevate your wardrobe with something truly special, look no further. These handbags offer elegance, utility, and a sense of identity—all rolled into one perfectly-stitched package.",1,1763741017.0,TheWideContent,0,1.0,False

I don’t want below to dimmish the struggles that people are going through. I know it’s hard across the US, but I just had to share what is going on in my personal life just so I can vent and get this off my chest

Background: I was let go in April. Unemployment has been exhausted, and I must work at Target and be a substitute because companies are impressed with my qualifications, but they are moving forward with other candidates

Anyway, as you can assume, I have been hunting for jobs for a while. I have written so many cover letters that it could be a small novel.

I have been extremely professional in my cover letters, however, there is a level of frustration now brewing for some time and I just couldn’t do the same song and dance.  I decided to change it up and tell people how mad I am.

Everything is redacted well... because I am still looking for a job after 7 months.

  
Spoiler Alert: I don't think they looked at my cover letter or resume. 

  
Below is the limited communication that I had with this company.

My wife says I am going to burn bridges, but I keep saying how do I burn bridges if they have never even been built. 

Hiring Manager,

I’m applying for the **this company**. This is the 124th cover letter I’ve written this year. At this point, I’ve applied to more jobs than I’ve ordered coffee—and considering how much espresso I put away, that’s genuinely alarming. If AI passes on this one again, I’ll hit *brew*, shake it off, and move on to #125. And yes, AI helped me write this. If it’s going to judge me, it should at least contribute.

That said, this is actually one of the few roles that genuinely aligns with what I do. I have 13 years of experience in technology-focused account management, driving revenue across SaaS, cybersecurity, UCaaS, broadband, and managed services. I’ve carried and exceeded $1M+ quotas, not by reading from a feature sheet, but by understanding business challenges, advising decision-makers, and driving outcomes they can defend. I build strategic relationships that evolve into long-term partnerships and I’m often the one called when a deal is at risk or a client needs a turnaround approach.

I manage full-cycle sales—from pipeline development to close, negotiation, escalation handling, adoption, and growth. I work closely with engineering, product, and implementation teams to make sure what I sell becomes sustainable usage—not shelf ware. My approach is consultative, pragmatic, and focused on actual results.

If I’m not considered qualified for this role, then either the job description is misleading, or we’ve entered a phase in hiring where buzzwords outrank proven performance. LinkedIn even indicates I’m a “strong match.” If algorithms get to deny humans, they should at least get a vote when they think someone might be a fit.

Let me be transparent: this is the *first time* I’ve applied for this role but based on what I’ve experienced in the job search this year, I’d be mildly shocked if I even get a conversation. And honestly, I can’t figure out why I’m not getting more interviews. Based on my experience, I feel fully qualified… do I smell? I checked. Twice. I’m good.

Also—for what it’s worth—the minimum requirement for this role is a high school diploma. I have a Master’s. What exactly are we doing here?

Worst case, you just read the only cover letter today that wasn’t written in “corporate auto-reject” tone. Best case, we talk, have an actual human exchange, and you realize I’m the strategic, relationship-driven, technically capable AE you want representing **This Company.**

If any part of this resonated, I’d love to connect. If not, cover letter #125 will be written with more caffeine and slightly less optimism.

Cheers (because “sincerely” doesn’t feel honest today),  
My Name

P.S. Don’t worry, I’m fully professional with customers. I only write like this when an applicant tracking system challenges my spirit.

 

 

**Thank you for applying to This Company - Account Executive**

​

My Name

 

Thank you for applying for the Account Executive role at **This company** We appreciate the time you took to apply for this opportunity.

 

While we were impressed with your qualifications, we have decided to move forward with other candidates at this time.

When I am faced with pressure for sensual desire, ie watching a youtube video. Grabbing a coffee. Looking at people. Taking a hot shower. Lying down in a comfy bed.



I notice the pressure. The pressure tries to push me to do those things. In those pressuring moments, those sensual objects do seem pleasant. But at the same time, I recognize that giving in won’t get rid of the pressure. Only give rise to new pressure. So I don’t give in. After the pressure goes away, those sensual objects don’t have that same appeal anymore. I basically couldn’t care less about having them or not, I have 0 concern for it. The objects still have a pleasant aspect, but only in an abstract way. Not the same as when I am pressured, the pleasure is more concretely felt or anticipated. When I am pressured, there is also this quality of actually wanting the pleasure. I believe that is the craving. So while pressure depends on craving, they aren’t the same.



After the pressure fades, I reflect on those things again. There are different angles to look at it. The pleasure it can give. If I linger on that aspect, the pressure can arise again. If I linger on the danger, I feel glad for not doing it and it makes me happy. If I linger on the practical aspects of it, I can find a way to engage with it without pressure - but it’s dangerous, because the intention can change rapidly, it can be a cover up.

1p3280v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p3280v/aitah_for_leaving_less_than_1_as_a_tip/,AITAH for leaving less than $1 as a tip?,"I work a couple of blocks from a small bakery.  They sell mostly single serving baked goods, cookies, cupcakes and brownies.  They do have a small coffee area set up. It’s nothing fancy.  They have 4 airpots set up with decaf, regular and two other random hot drinks, usually tea, sometimes hot chocolate or spiced apple cider.  They have little packets of Splenda or sugar and powdered coffee creamer.  They hand you whatever size cup you bought at the counter and you fix your own. Usually when I ordered online the empty cup was sitting on the display case when I got there.  

I get a 15 minute break in the morning and another in the afternoon. I usually do not stay at work during my breaks because I really like to take a mental break from work and some of my coworkers insist on talking about work during our break. I find it easier to leave and give my mind a ‘reset’ than to stay and repeatedly explain that I will chat about any topic aside from work. 

The bakery is a 5 minute walk each way, so just perfect for getting away from the office.

Some years ago I ordered an 8 oz hot drink with a 20% tip and have just selected to repeat that order since then.  I never buy anything else. 

So a couple of weeks ago I walked in and the cashier handed me my cup. I filled it and walked out.  The other cashier followed me out and threw coins in my direction, called me every dirty name she could think of and said that no one needs your penny tip.  

I walked back to my office.  Later that day the coffee shop owner messaged me on Facebook messenger and said, “I just want you to know that I did fire (cashier) because I just can’t have an employee act that way, but it is kind of a d*ck move to leave less than a $1 tip.”  

I paid for my coffee online with my credit card and never really gave a second thought to the price breakdown. I went back and looked since then and the coffee was $1.98 including tax and the 20% tip was exactly 40 cents.  

I haven’t been back since the incident because of the message the owner sent me.  

Additional information: At this shop, the cashiers are paid minimum wage weekly, the owner who does the baking keeps cash tips, the cashiers get a check once a month with all the credit card tips from the month paid proportionally based on how many hours they worked. If they end up making less than $14/hour for the month, the owner makes up the difference.  

These days, I walk in the opposite direction to a little convenience store to buy my coffee.  Some days I wonder if AITAH for leaving less than a dollar tip. Back when I paid for everything with cash, I wouldn’t have left coins on a table, but now that I pay with a cc mostly, I just leave 20% and don’t bother that it generally isn’t an even dollar amount.

My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long.

It’s Friday. You’ve successfully navigated another week, and now it’s time to shift your focus from wrapping up the present to planning your high-impact actions for the coming week. Use this moment to set yourself up for immediate success on Monday. Stop thinking about what you should do and commit to executing these five high-impact tasks.

𝟭. 𝗢𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘇𝗲 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗟𝗶𝘀𝘁

Don't just apply blindly. Identify your top three ""Dream Roles"" and your top three ""Target Companies."" Spend 60% of your application time tailoring materials specifically for these six targets, and 40% on volume applications. 

𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Create a list of 6 specific jobs/companies this weekend and dedicate your initial application efforts to them next week.

𝟮. 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗱𝘂𝗹𝗲 𝗧𝘄𝗼 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝘀

Networking is about gathering information, not just asking for a job. Identify two people currently working in a role or company you admire. Reach out with a genuine, concise request for a 15-minute virtual coffee to learn about their career path, not to ask for an opening. 

𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Draft and schedule two tailored informational interview requests to be sent out Monday morning.

𝟯. 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗥𝗲𝗳𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗵 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗦𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀

Job descriptions evolve rapidly. Dedicate one hour this week to an online course (LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, etc.) or a deep dive into an industry article to gain one new, specific, marketable skill (e.g., a specific Excel function, a concept in AI, or a new social media strategy). 

𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻:  Spend 60 minutes actively learning one new, relevant skill next week and note how it applies to your target roles.

𝟰. 𝗥𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗲-𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗮 𝗝𝗼𝗯 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻

Pick a role you were recently rejected for or one that feels slightly out of reach. Print the job description. Highlight every required skill or task you don't have. For each gap, list a specific project, course, or volunteer activity you could do this month to close that gap. 

𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Spend 45 minutes this weekend reverse-engineering a challenging job description to identify concrete skill-building tasks for next week.

𝟱. 𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗬𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝘂𝗺 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗤𝘂𝗼𝘁𝗮

To beat procrastination, remove the emotional component of applying. Set a non-negotiable, daily minimum standard. Whether it’s 2 tailored applications, 5 networking comments, or 1 hour of research, make it measurable and manageable.

𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Commit to a small, quantifiable job search activity every single day next week, no matter what.

Commit to these five actions, and successfully launch your job search momentum this coming week! Have a productive weekend!",1,1763740403.0,SharpHRCareerSupport,0,1.0,False

I like people who feel genuine. People who tell stories in their own way, even if they drift a little before they get to the point. People who actually laugh when something is funny and do not force it just to fill the silence

I'm hoping this post helps one person get started on a new project today, something that they have been putting off.

**Biz Name (20 mins):** In first app which is [yourpilla.com](http://yourpilla.com) we spent £2k with a branding agency to come up with a brand name and I remember looking back that there biggest piece of advice was ""Pick any name as long as its not a sh\*t one"" - total waste of money that was.

But for Pilla we are trying to create a brand so something brandable was/is important, but for this app, I'm not really trying to do that, I am making a really specific tool with a pre-existing market demand so I wanted a more descriptive name.

The tool will be software to help people rank their websites so I jumped onto Google Keyword Planner to see what people where searching for in the space and Website Ranking was a good description with search volume.

I bought [yourwebsiteranker.com](http://yourwebsiteranker.com) for less than the price of a coffee in GoDaddy. Name done.

**Website (20 mins):** I'm already familiar with Nextjs/Vercel and I have a Plus account at Tailwind CSS which means all I had to do was start a new NextJS project with one page and grab a pre-built call to action block from Tailwind.

I updated the messaging on the call to action block, and added a screenshot which I made on Canva.

If you don't use Nextjs or Tailwind, there are plenty of other options available to you. You could do the same thing equally fast in another tech stack that you are familiar with such as Wix, Wordpress or Webflow.

If you've never done this before, then it will clearly take you some time to learn how to do it for the first, but familiarising yourself with one tech stack is a great investment so that you will be able to do this in 15 minutes.

**Waitlist (20 mins):** I signed up to [Resend.com](http://Resend.com) which is a mailing option made specifically for developers. It means that I can send a confirmation email to people who subscribe to the call to action waitlist straight away, and the email addresses will be saved in the sent folder on [Resend.com](http://Resend.com) \- this is what i'll use to organise my waitlist.

I could get more clever and create a CRM or some other way of organising a waitlist but my priority here was speed and all I need is a list of email addresses.

Again, you dont have to use Resend. I used to use a service named Loops, but you could also use Mailchimp or any other email service that you are familiar with.

**Launch it.** I've been thinking about this project for years so when I decided to pull the trigger yesterday, I just wanted to get it out there into the world, get some social commitment running through my veins and encourgement to take step 2.

I think at this stage in any project, the most important thing is consistent, small steps that you get you to next run of the ladder. Don't think about the everything that you need to do, because you'll never get started, just what needs doing today.

Hope this helps or inspires you get started on something.",1,1763739765.0,buildinpublic,0,1.0,False

1p31qfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1p31qfo/not_sleeping_but_tired_all_day/,"Not Sleeping, but Tired All Day","All right y'all, I am *suffering* rn.

So prior to this past week, I have been dealing with a really inconsistent sleep cycle.  I would get tired in the evening and fall asleep, but then wake up just a few hours later (1 AM ish) and be unable to get back to sleep until mid- to late morning.  In an attempt to resolve this, I have been trying to go hard on the sleep hygiene and only allow myself to sleep between the hours of midnight and 9 AM, which I've been doing for the past week.

Problem is, it's not working.

Necessary medical background: I take Wellbutrin instant release 75 mg twice daily, I drink one 500 ml cup of coffee when I wake up, and I have obstructive sleep apnea, which I treat with a BiPAP.  My BiPAP mask seal is generally fine (it was a little bad last night and two nights ago, but I don't think this explains the problem) and my number of apnea events is less than 0.5 per hour.

Go to sleep around 1 or 2 AM.  Wake up five hours later.  Try to go back to sleep so I can get some more sleep during the allowed period.  Lie in bed awake until my alarm goes of at 9 AM.  Get up, take my Wellbutrin (75 mg instant release) and make coffee.  Usually I feel pretty tired.

Take my second Wellbutrin does at 1 PM.  By 3–4 PM, I am *dreadfully* tired, I have a massive headache, and I am an *asshole* because I am so tired.  By 6 PM, my body is *screaming* at me to go so sleep.  I try to do activities that aren't conducive to me falling asleep, but I also have *zero* energy.  In general, 5 PM to 11 PM is filled with me fighting with all my might to stay awake.

Then, after 11 PM, my body decides to be a bit less tired.  When I finally decide to go to bed, it's a conscious decision I have to make.  For the preceding 8 hours, I would pull up a video I want to watch and have to put it off to another time because I am so tired that I cannot stay awake to watch the video, but then my body decides, now that it's night time, that it's time to be awake.

The only drugs I put into my body are my Wellbutrin (as prescribed) and on the schedule above, coffee in the morning, sometimes I will make a cup of tea in the afternoon, but never later than 2:30 PM, and I will take Ibuprofen to deal with the headaches if they get bad enough.

I honestly don't know what to do.  Everything was more or less fine until about a month ago.  I did have a stressful month and that made my sleep schedule bad, but I feel like I should not be every single day I feel like I'm dying.  I've been on the Wellbutrin and using the CPAP for about a year now, so that shouldn't be changing suddenly.

(Also I have no health insurance.  God bless America.)",1,1763739308.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 10: Wanna see his dead lifts?

# Jan 03, 2025: Jacqueline Flynn

*Human\* (Technically)*

Connie left already to catch the morning rush at the CaFae. My shower finished, I walk out into the hallway to the smell of eggs and sausage. God that woman is fantastic. I inhale the amazing aroma and walk into the kitchen with just my towel on. *Might as well pay Pat for the food with a show.*

“I heard that.”

I laugh and walk in. “I know.”  Pat would be a dork if she wasn’t so adorable.

“There’s sweet tea in the fridge. We can make coffee if you like. Toast will be ready in a couple of minutes. Hope you like ham and cheese omelet. Grab some sausage.”

Why does this feel like Deja vú? She damn well knows I love her ham and cheese omelets too. I smile at the woman I love above all others and grab a sausage. “Mmmmm heaven. This is perfect.”

Pat turns around and shows me a ring in a box. “No, you are. I love you and have for longer than I realized. You are the one I want to stay with as long as possible. Will you marry me?”

I am blinking. Staring. I am not sure how long I stand there like a dumbass. My brain has just stopped working. It is overloaded with every emotion I can think of. How long have I been just gawking at my love? I know it is too long.

My brain is still processing the ring. The words hit. I am crying. I know I look like an idiot. I don’t care. All those times where my heart ached for this woman all feel so easily worth it for this moment.

“Yes, absolutely, 100%, I will gladly marry you, Patricia Rae Wallace, my one above all others.”

She grins at me. “Strange way to say ‘yes’ darlin'.”

“I was worried I took too long and gave you the wrong impression and I wanted to make sure you know I mean it.” I know I am blabbering. “Let me have this one.”

“Of course, darling. Now eat before the food gets cold.”

I smile at this woman. “I am fine with it being cold if I can get hot with you elsewhere…”

She laughs and slaps my hands which had somehow started groping her of their own accord, honest. “We have work!”

I don’t miss a beat. “I can call in engaged for a day…”

She gives me a kiss that leaves me breathless. So easy for her to do. No one else can manage it. “We have a lot of work to deal with. And not all of it is work, work.  Also, what are we going to do about Connie?”  She sounds a little sad.

I hug my beautiful woman. “There’s room for a king in the master if we make some small changes. The three of us can fit.”

She looks at me. “You going to be okay with that? I know Cindy and Ricky are sort of tip toeing towards being in an open thing and we are helping...”  She is so adorable. She is also figuring out the whole sharing thing. I know I am not worried about anyone stealing her from me. Maybe not even Mab. Because Mab and I have an understanding and, more importantly, this woman won’t ever leave me. She isn’t going to assume anything about me because that isn’t who she is.

I am eating as I think and talk with her.

“Look, Connie has had a crush on you for almost as long as I have. Hell, maybe longer if it started when you lost Penny. She and I would spend some quiet moments on my break bitching about how dense you are and how one of us was going to sit on your face and finally be able to let the other know how amazing it is. Hell, we made a bet…  Oh shit. I won that bet.” 

Pat is so curious. She smiles mischievously as she asks, “what was the bet for?”

My cheeks get red. Shit. I haven’t called in the bet. I had forgotten until just now.

“Um…”

She senses weakness and pounces. “Give!!”

“Well, um, it was sex. Like mind blowing sex. Just who would be the one in charge is all. Like the loser has to wear a collar and bondage would be involved…”

She makes a shocked face. “YOU FORGOT THIS? You are gonna have to collect!”

I look at her. “We just got engaged like 2 minutes ago, you are worried about how I feel and making sure I am okay with keeping things open for her, and now you are encouraging me to go have sex with a nymph that has been in love with you about as long as I have.  Who are you and what happened to the vanilla, mostly straight, and very monogamous Pat I knew?”

“You happened, Jackie, you happened. And you are the best thing that ever has happened to me. Also, I think I may have been bi or at least Demi this whole damn time and didn’t realize it.”

I look at this woman. “We can be late to work, right? Cuz I am definitely gonna take you to bed right now.”

“My boss won’t complain. I’ll call yours and tell him not to. You know what, we are calling in for the day…”

I grab her hand and take her to the bedroom as she is texting Lemar and Jason.

*Human Archmage*

This can’t be happening. Yet it is. I have never had problems with these damn wolves. Yet here I am, getting my ass kicked. Ten attackers. Led by a cape wearing, spear wielding maniac that keeps boasting and ranting about his ultimate power. Meanwhile, I am running out of juice to put these corpses back together

Normally I would just animate my dead foes and use them. It is less juice intensive than stitching them back up. Every time you reanimate one they lose a little in performance. Of course, I would be fighting a bunch of creatures with legendary resilience and speed. Reminds me of the Fox of Yorkshire 50 years ago. I outnumbered him 50 to 1 and he still almost got me. In the end I did destroy all of him except a hand that had crawled off, but I can’t do this here.

“I don’t suppose we can talk this out?  I have never once attacked your kind and I had no intention of doing it. I am just researching life extension methods. Why attack an old man that isn’t causing problems?

“You are a necromancer.” He spits out the words.

“I would say I like necks as much as the next guy. I certainly don’t go out of my way to romance them…” If he isn’t going to talk, he can deal with my greatest weapon.

“You mock me?”

I smile. “Perish the thought. I am simply trying to find common ground or if that fails, impress you. I’ve even been bodybuilding lately. Wanna see my dead lifts?” I throw an animated skeleton at him. He shatters it with the spear haft and is not impressed by the double pun. Pity.

“I will tear you limb from limb.”

“That isn’t very friendly. Have a heart, my guy.”  I throw a jar holding a heart at him. As soon as it is close enough, it explodes.

“All your taunts do is raise my ire. Are you trying to do that on purpose?!”

Ire? Bet he had to look that one up. Doesn’t matter, I got him. Wow, this guy is just walking into these… I think I might be facing someone that helps keep the average IQ down at 100… “No. I just want to quickly raise a family. I know where one is buried close to each other, be right back.”

I hear his enraged screams as I jump out the escape hatch I have for emergencies and start running. The hatch is thick steel and guarded by 4 zombies so it should last a while. This tunnel leads 3 blocks away and is less than 10 feet from a car. I need to find a safe place.

I get to the car and start driving. They will be weaker in the day, but still able to kill me. Maybe I can ask for help. I have a favor I can call in. I tell my Map program where to go. 30 minutes thanks to light traffic this early. But they probably won’t attack me with that many witnesses. I pull out a card with glowing blue script floating above it. I head to the place and tell my car to make a call. I should be safe if she agrees to help me. “Hello, Mab?”

 

# Jan 03, 2025: Lemar

*Enlightened Human*

Grey walks in. Wearing their normal almost provocative outfit. They are a woman right now. I chuckle. I know they can control the flip to an extent. Apparently, Merfolk Pat is an anomaly in that regard. Grey likes being female around John, but I have seen them making out in either form with him. John looks up and he damn near jumps with joy. Yeesh. I should not have called them in to work while he is here. “John take a quick break.” He smiles and gets the hint.

Grey and John both follow me into the office. “Remember, professional on the floor. No smooches.” Grey laughs. John looks like his hand got caught in the cookie jar. I look again. “John, this is not the floor, but please refrain from grabbing Grey’s ass in front of me.”

They both giggle. Yeesh.

“You have 2 minutes before Grey needs to clock in. If it isn’t on company time, like in a break or before clocking in, I have no say in it, especially if I can’t see it. Just clock in on time and be on the floor in 3.”  I wink and turn around. I can hear them start kissing. Young love. Heh. Like I have room to talk.

I wait by the door and knock at the time to clock in. Grey and John are out and smiling within 10 seconds. John gives me bro code head nod for being a friend. I nod back. I got his back.

We head out and start working. I know rule 3 is a thing for a reason. The fact that we have no less than 3 couples of “mixed” origin on staff has not escaped mine nor Pat’s attention. Grey and John make a lot of sense. John loved hanging out with Grey in both genders before he found out they were the same person. That was a hell of a prank on Grey’s part. I doubt that couple waited for Grey to get a job here 3 months ago. I’d be mad but Pat and I consider Grey borderline anyway. John is a rule breaker. He has been dubbed the “bad boy” by a lot of staff and clients alike. Weirdly he doesn’t have a police record unlike some of the so called “nice guys” on staff. His calendar shots with Grey are the current month and they are a huge hit. Didn’t know he had that ink and that 6 pack. Man is bad boy goals. He’s also one of the kindest guys around. Heh.

Paul dating Dis isn’t a big deal. Those two are a model of professionalism and cute together. 

Then there is Merfolk Pat and human Grace. I never would have pegged that pairing. 40 something mom of a kid around drinking age dating a creature that wants to give birth to a kid but got so enamored that they didn’t really think it through.  Tragic love. Grace is pretty sure something will crack, though she absolutely loves Pat, she knows Pat wants something that can’t be done by her.

And then there’s Mona…

“We need some help on the drive thru, sir.”  She is all business. Today she’s basically in a Librarian outfit. Her hair in a perfect bun. The glasses I know she doesn’t need are the perfect accent. As always, she has a shirt buttoned down to where a single button teases everyone witnessing her. Her tailor needs a raise. I suspect that all her buttons have been reinforced with not just better stitching but some infernal magic. I nod and send Grey and John to her. She winks at me.

If I were a weaker man, she’d be tempting. Her charms are impressive. Impressive enough that just about every single guy here has had a few dates with her.  About half the ladies have as well.  And all the Fae except Todd have, the Merfolk included… 

Even after they have stopped dating she is good with them. Part of it is just how sex seems to be completely casual and almost transactional to her. The other part of it is I think she doesn’t want to lose this place.  Funny considering how she almost had her head bashed in by Pat her first time here for assaulting Jackie…

Boss bitch has a policy on second chances.  “Yes.”

We have 3 convicted felons, an incubus, a hobgoblin that unwittingly helped in an assassination plot on Pat, and a troll I know has eaten a human. In Todd’s defense, the guy was sneaking into Patricia’s hospital to try and kill her after that earlier mentioned assassination attempt. And Amai, said hobgoblin, has been an incredibly great employee.

Makes me happy having this place be home. Now we just gotta figure out how to deal with the werewolf issue. Well, the spear issue. It’s the actual problem from what I can tell.  And then there’s what is to me the real problem. That offer from corporate.

Chime. Regular. Good. Oh hey, it’s one of the double regulars. They are slightly more common than unicorns. I have met 4 unicorns… Mona smiles and this guy can’t help but smile back. Her greeting is perfect, has his order done with enough flirting to get him super happy to be here, and on to the next person. When’s her review?  May be time to get her a raise.

I keep trying to avoid thinking about that offer.

What do I do about that franchise offer upstate I got three days ago? I really need to tell May but they gave me a few weeks to think it over. I am not sure we can leave our family like this. And I am scared of telling her because it means losing a lot of her connections in this world.

Though this werewolf scare may help. Shit.

What do I do here? Ugh.

 

# Jan 03, 2025: Mona

*Demon*

One of my favorite naïve regulars is here. Phil. Great guy, ready smile, kind hands.  Foot fetish. He somehow hasn’t figured out so much about this place. He does show up at least twice a week when I am on. But he is a good soul. Unlike me.

Lemar is brooding. He had a smile for a long while but now something is on his mind. I wish I could figure it out.

Wait. Why do I care?  I became a demon when my first life ended. A bitter Greek woman without any power in a society that treated me like shit. I figured out I could control men, and women, with a well placed smile, a hand where it shouldn’t be, and a willingness to degrade myself with any depravity if it meant I could use that against them. By the time I was thirty five I ran my shitty little town from the shadows using their sexual urges to control them. And all it got me was a death to some STI and an unmarked grave because no one actually liked me, they couldn’t resist me, or they hated me and still used me when they could. I went back with this new body and destroyed the village over the course of a decade in much the same way as I ran it. The raiders I got to destroy it were thorough.

I spent almost a millennia bouncing from hell to this world. Making deals with sexually frustrated humans, helping their needs in exchange for parts of their soul and the power it gave me. Among the demons ranks I am considered powerful. Strong enough that even true devils give me a fairly wide berth. Sammy was always respectful with me.

And then I got a contract that was poorly worded. I realized I could stay here. I picked up the trade I am best at. I can always tell what they want. Speaking of. I think I will bus Phil’s table.

“Everything okay, Phil?” I smile and go to grab something. As I do I let my left shoe slip off. “Whoops. Sorry about that.” I bend over so he can see my silhouette as I grab that high heel. I take my time putting my shoe back on right in front of him. Another man’s eyes would wander up and down my profile. Hell, a few do and at least one woman. So many of the Fae do. They are all so cute. Phil? He just stares at my foot. I look over and wink. He swallows some air. He knows he got caught. He knows I did it on purpose. He knows I didn’t mind him looking.

So damn easy to get them if I want them.

And yet, my Dom business isn’t really my priority. I still do it. Still make good money. Still take on new clients. Maybe Phil might be one later. But it isn’t what I look forward to. This place is.

And Lemar is part of that. And he is being bothered by something. I want to fix that. Wait, why do I care? Why did I circle back to this? Why has it not stopped?

Because he is family.

Fuck.

I never really had one. I was a slave before 10. Just a pornai to all the men and some of the women that lived in the village with me. After I ascended to demonic power, I was just a convenience to those that summoned me.

But here, I am family.

Dammit to hell.

Why am I now facing Lemar?  Oh yea. To be a friend.

“Hey, Lemar, can we talk?” Why am I doing this? Because I want to. I do what I want.

He nods and motions to follow. We get in Pat’s super comfy and “not a real office” space. “What’s up? Oh, was that shoe drop necessary?”

I laugh. “Nothing bad and yes it was. Phil has a foot fetish. He is a good guy, thought I would give him a treat.”

His Spock eyebrow game is almost as good as Pat’s. I laugh.

“No ulterior motives, I swear. I try to be good at work.”

His laugh sounds beautiful. It has no malice. “You never ‘try’ to be good at work, you just ARE good. Amazing most days. Now don’t let me distract you. Why did you want to talk?”

My cheeks are burning. I… I get compliments a lot. But this one feels different. I push forward anyway. “What is bugging you, my friend? I can see something eating away at you. I...I am worried.”

I register the shock he feels. His soul is normally so calm and it suddenly goes into a storm. He looks to be thinking it over and then nods.

“Well, I got an offer to start a franchise location upstate. It would mean moving.”

I can see why he was fussing immediately. No wonder.

I grab his hands. “That is both wonderful and terrible news. I see why. What does May think?”

“She… she doesn’t know yet. I got asked three days ago and things are a little hectic.” He looks a little ashamed.

My face appears to be giving him a disapproving look. “Lemar, an Incubus you work with should not know about this before your wife.”

He nods. His eyes meet mine, “Maybe, but a friend does. One that is extremely self-composed and levelheaded. One I know gives wise counsel when she wants to.”

I stare at this human. I am not sure what to say. I feel something strange on my face. Huh? What is going on?

“Oh shit, I am sorry. I didn’t mean to make you cry, Mona.” He looks genuinely upset.

Cry? What is he talking about. I am not… what is… I pull my hand from my cheek. It is wet. I am crying?  I haven’t since I died. It shouldn’t really be possible. I gave away that part of my soul for this power. I… I am crying. What is wrong with me?

My friend needs me. He told me this for a reason. Fucker made me cry. I won’t let him down.

“I am…honored. Now then, this w…wise counselor will dispense that wis..wisdom. TELL. YOUR. WIFE.” I stick my finger to his chest.  “She needs to know. She is…is smart and wonderful. She will help you make a…a decision that works for your family. She will tell you what sh…she thinks an…and you will know the right an…answer. I didn’t g…get to see your wedding but I heard she offered her swan coat to you and you…you gave it back. Let me tell you, you romantic asshole, I would ha…have killed to ha..have someone like you tell me I mattered to them while I was alive. I nev…never got that. She has it. Sh….she  will cherish it and and and she wi-will help you do-do what works best for y-your beautiful family.  O-okay?”

I… why am I sobbing so much? What is going on?  Why?  I… what is wrong with me?!

He is holding me. Not like a lover, not like some weak willed submissive ordered to. Like a friend. The sobs only get worse.

“Oh god Mona, what is wrong?  Are you going to be okay?”

I nod. “Yea. I am just… happy?  I have a friend.”  I look up and his caring about me physically hurts me. I… I have a friend. I wail. Fuck, I am letting him down.

“I have a friend?  I don’t…don’t de…deserve a friend.  I…I don’t know wu…what is wrong wi…with me.  I ca…can’t stop crying.”

I spend the next 5 minutes sobbing like a complete wreck. He holds me for some of it. At some point someone opens the door to ask if things were okay. It is John. He tells Lemar to go up front and make that text he wants to. I think he asked for someone to replace me.  Okay, yea, fair.  I Guess Lemar is also telling May about the franchise now. Good. John holds me. In comes Grey. Now Grey is holding me. What is going on? Grey is making kind noises and not saying anything. Just humming to me.

I have family. I am loved. All because I came here and fucked things up but then Ms. Wallace still gave me a chance. I have a second chance. I am going to seize it and maybe find happiness. Makes getting my head almost bashed in worth it.

*Enlightened Human*

My phone rings. It’s Jackie. Weird. She called two days ago to wish us a Happy New Year. I don’t have a bad feeling so I pick up and smile as I answer, “Hi, baby. How are you?”

“SHE ASKED! SHE ASKED!! SHE ASKED!!!!”

My baby is a wonderful girl. She also has a habit of leaving out context sometimes. And yet… Wait.

“Jackie, are you… engaged?”

“YESYESYES!!!!”

Bob looked up when I said engaged. He heard her response. His look of complete happiness probably mirrors my own.

“I am so happy for you honey. Oh wow. She’s amazing and let her know how happy we are for both of you!”

“Thanks mom!” It is Patricia’s voice. She sounds so happy. Oh, my wonderful firecracker found an amazing person that makes her that happy. I am so going to be a proud mom at their wedding.

“I know this is a big day. You two enjoy it. I am sure you don’t have a date yet, and that’s fine. Just give us windows to visit, okay? We can afford a couple of trips before you get married.”

“Mom, um, Pat wants to say something. I got you on speaker now.” 

“You don’t have to afford anything, mom. I will cover it.”

“Patricia I don’t want you to have to pay for us, that is a burden on young people.” Bob looks at me as if I am forgetting something.

“Ma’am, um, I had my accountant explain to me that when you count all my assets and debts, I am still worth over a million. That was before last quarter’s profits come in. You two are not and never will be a burden. Not to the family of one of the people that helped make me who I am.”

“Awwww babe. Keep talking like that and I am going to want another round…”

“JACKIE!”  Patricia and I echo one another. Of course Bob is laughing like an idiot. 

 

# Jan 03, 2025: Mab, Queen of Air and Darkness

*Sidhe*

A favor has been claimed. It isn’t a small one. I owe this human a life. Truthfully, I do not mind at all. My goddaughter, Candace Fredericks, was a year old when I saw the disease spreading through her on a visit. It was already spreading fast. Aggressive. Her parents knew she was behaving sickly. They had no clue she was dying.

It took two small favors to find this man. And then I offered him riches and power. He said he needed neither. I begged. I pleaded. Anything within my means. I meant it.

 He said he would do it for a favor. A life for a life. For the first time in my existence, I agreed to it without thinking of the ramifications, calculating a way to cheat him, or even caring. That girl is special to me. Even now.

He used his magic to remove the mutating tissue. Healed the organs that lost parts and did so with an alacrity and professionalism that was almost awe inspiring. “She won’t wake up from her ‘nap’ for an hour or two. Little one is tough. I barely had to use anything to keep her stable. I also locked her body into a standard growth path. She shouldn’t see cancer again for her life. It should hopefully remove any hereditary cancers from her line. We were lucky, I know how to beat this one. And even then, any longer a wait and it would have been too much to heal.”

He not only gave her life, he made sure she would not suffer the horror of losing a child to what she survived. This human showed forethought and competence I had rarely seen before.

Since then, we have corresponded and had pleasant chats along with a few business ventures together. Before meeting Pat, he was an acquaintance. I could never allow myself to become close to someone, even the child I cherish dearly and her family. Now I would call him a friend as much as I would William.

And he is in danger. I pull up to the CaFae and step into the lobby. I see him sitting at a booth with a drink in hand.

I look at the server, John, yes, politely terrified of me, bit rough around the edges, splendid abs, would look good mounting me, in love with that one merfolk….Grey?  He smiles. “Elixir today, good lady?”  Ever the professional. I smile and wink.  “Not today. Maybe later. A simple mocha, surprise me on which.” I lay out enough coins to cover the bill and leave a tip and then head to meet with my friend.

“My lady. I had hoped to never have to call in this favor.  Honestly, I only asked for it as an excuse to be able to save that little girl without you being weird about it.” He smiles at me.

I know he lost a baby girl to a similar disease many decades ago. It started his research.  It was one of the reasons I knew he could do it when he said he could.

“I don’t mind. That favor was a bargain to me. Oh, I have pictures of her daughter!!  She is healthy, thanks to you.”

He smiles so brightly that I believe I may just have given him a favor for free.

“I would love to see them.” I show him pictures as John hands me my drink.

“John, dear, you didn’t have to come out here to do this.”

He laughs. “You forget you own part of business and as such are kinda one of my bosses. What moron makes their boss walk for coffee?”

I roll my eyes. “Please. We all know this place is Pat’s. Speaking of, is the darling girl in?”

He shakes his head. “She is off today. Celebrating with Jackie.”

I look at him and I can hear him internally cheering.

Oh. The joy is far too great to be anything else…

“Who asked whom?” He smiles as he knows exactly why I asked.

“Our gal stepped up and asked the redhead. Surprised her and everything.”

I smile. Somehow I am able to not scream in a blind rage at losing her to Jackie or jump with joy and begin laughing and crying in happiness. I am not sure which emotion is stronger. “Good for her. May we use the office? I need to get him to safety.”

“Like I said before. You also own the building. Also, we were told all the queens are allowed to use the office. That was like a week after she bought the building. A ‘just in case’ order. You know how she is.”

I nod. I very much do. Standing up I look at Frank and say, “follow me.” He gets up and begins to follow. 

John looks at me and seems upset, “One warning, there is someone having a moment in there.”

Interesting.

As we walk Frank comments, “Patricia is the one you are both referring to as Pat, correct?” I nod. He laughs. “So the barista that has a name tag of Boss Bitch is actually the owner? Why? I would think if this business is as successful as it seems she wouldn’t be working the counter.”

I wave at Lemar on the phone and then laugh as I open the office for him. “Step inside, you may see the answer.” We step in and the room speaks volumes. The walls have been decorated as one would a place you live. The many office necessities are here. However, there is a couch in the room which faces a desk that is set up so you can see the screen from it while they person at the desk works. The entire room feels like a home. On the comfy couch is their resident demon and the Merfolk Grey. Grey is rocking the demon who is… crying? Unanticipated. I will have to adjust things. She has started having emotions now? I will need to know why. Not the person I expected here nor the behavior I anticipated.

Comfort items are all over and it feels like a room that is lived in. She is even hugging a pillow for such occasions. Mona is curled around it while being held herself.

“Huh. Pat loves it here. Wait, is that Mona?”

The demon looks up. “Hi Frank. Long time no see. Um…. Sorry I am a complete mess today. I just figured out I am happy.” She starts sobbing again and Grey wraps her up in their arms and begins rocking.

“Mona, demons are never truly happy.” Frank is looking upset.

“I am. Here. With…with my family.” She buried her face in Grey’s chest and it is completely for comfort and neither believes otherwise.

“I think I get why this place exists and she is still working the floor. She made a place where anyone can be loved as family and friends. She likes being home.”

“You get her. Mona, darling, I am so very happy for you.” I truly am. As demons go, she is kind and professional. Far too kind. I was right about her, as was He.

I turn to Frank, “Now hold my hand. We can cross over anywhere within this domain, but this specific place makes it easy and safe. Only by Connie’s tree is easier.”

I pull him with me to the true world and we go through a gate we Queens set up nearby. In an instant, we are at Court. While it is not in full session, there are always a few members there. I nod at Morgana and she smiles in return. Emm as we have all begun calling him, is also there and bows.

“This mortal is being given sanctuary by the Winter Court. Do any object?” Formalities must be observed.

Both the others shake their heads.

“Until the danger has passed, he is to be an honored guest. What was the danger? I didn’t even ask…”

“Werewolves, idiot in charge has a spear. Said he couldn’t be beaten. I ran rather than test it.”

I nod. “A wise choice. So, Vampires and now you. He really does want a war. Stupid son of a bitch.”

“Hey now, don’t be mean.”

“He’s originally a moon form. His mother was a wolf. Literally a bitch.”

“Hold up. Did you make a pun?” He seems surprised.

I roll my eyes. “Contrary to popular belief I do have a sense of humor…”

“Saw a demon crying because she was happy and now the Queen of Darkness makes a pun. World’s ending. Pack it up folks!”

Several chuckles annoy me.

 

# Jan 03, 2025: Anton

*Vampire*

I do not want to do this. It is too dangerous. Especially since I am not alone. Todd and I are walking to my blood supplier. I don’t need to feed off of live creatures. I long ago developed a network where I can work with a human for fresh blood. He is not answering. I am worried the werewolves found him. I also need some blood. Off I go to check. I know this is likely a trap but I cannot feed off of Todd again. I tried once and… ooooof. That is dangerously addictive.  I need to never drink from him again. I may hurt him if I do. I will not hurt my friend.

We are at Frank’s research lab. I ring the doorbell and there is no response. That is not good. I motion to Todd and begin walking around the building. Todd sniffs and gags.

“Not good.”  He points up. We both see a broken window. This is an ill omen.

We get to it via a fire escape and I see the obvious signs of a battle. Dead bodies are on the floor. The smell of rot hangs in the air.

Looking around I can tell the bodies have been dead for years in some cases. Those smell the least bad. I continue searching and I find his cooler and freezer. Blood of all types is still good in there. And some bodies.

Todd is messing with Frank’s computer. I drink my fill and join him. I have 2 bags with me. Frank won’t mind. I can pay him later if he is still alive.

“Man, those werewolves were sloppy. That friend of yours, much less so. This place feels off. Nostalgic. More importantly, I might be able to crack this password, but it is not going to be easy. His password hint does help.”

I nod and then I hear the sound of shifting wood. “We have company.”

Todd nods. He is doing something I am clueless about. “Smelled them about a minute ago, at least 4. Shouldn’t be a problem.”

I stare at Todd. “What?”

He chuckles. “My dude, these are whelps and I have a vampire with me. You can handle one, right?”

I nod to him.

“I got the other 3 .  Easy peasy, lemon something something.”

In a flash they are on us.

I move and the Werewolf swings a stake at me.  Oh, they aren’t bothering to play around.  Wonderful. I jump forward, grab his head, and snap his neck. It won’t kill him, but he will take a while to heal and recover. I turn to assist Todd.

I need not have bothered. 2 of them are currently trying to push their entrails back into their bodies. The third is the pack leader. He is in war form.  He is bigger, faster, stronger. He is also in one of those macho attacks where he and Todd have intertwined fingers and are pushing each other. Todd keeps becoming more and more troll as I watch. He’s dropping the mask bit by bit.  I think he is doing it to show off.

“The fuck, you are a troll?!?!”

Todd laughs as he snaps the werewolves wrists in a flourish. He had been holding back the whole time.  “Yep, what, you thought a human disemboweled your buddies with his fingernails?”

It snarls and snaps its teeth at him. He bites its nose as it does.

The hands reach up and grab the now missing nose. It flops. I chuckle.

Then I see it. He finally drops all his glamor and is fully him.  Except, more. 

He is Tall, lanky, but the muscles may as well be steel.  I see his teeth and a smile like a crescent moon.  I also see something hovering above his head.  It is faint, but I see the crown of bones and iron nails. What the fuck is Todd?

The wolves retreat. We should run.

Todd goes back to the computer. He picks up the very old picture next to it, pulls it out of the frame and looks at the name on the back. 

He types in Eleanor06171923 into the password field.

The computer unlocks. He reverently returns the photo to the frame.

He puts in a flash drive and copies things.  Once he is done, he shuts down the computer.

“Okay, we can go, I will look at these at home.”

 

A few hours later…

 

“So your friend is technically a Necromancer.  He is definitely an Archmage by our standard. He can make the dead move and he can do a lot more.”

I notice something. “You are using present tense.”

“That I am, here’s the video of the attack.” We watch as he uses corpses to defend himself and then he starts making terrible jokes before running.

“If I had known he had that sense of humor, I never would have worked with him…”

Todd laughs. “That was the perfect ploy.  Knocked his opponent off center and he got to enjoy some top tier puns. I like this guy. Hey, he has video of another attack he dealt with before. Looks like it was in the 70s, must have converted it to digital. Guy’s keeping up with the times even though he’s like 120 years old.”

I gawk.  “He looks 60 at the most.”

“NECROMANCER…  His whole thing is about extending life, even beyond death. Oh, let’s look at this attack.”

We watch a troll show up and start yelling.  Todd stops the video after the first sentence. It was his voice.

“No…”

“Todd, you attacked him 50 years ago?”

“I…  fuck. I need to see this…”

We watch as dozens of undead swarm Todd.  He is yelling about how this wizard raised the wrong person from the dead and they won’t do it again. The necromancer is talking about how he is trying to get rid of the disease that killed him. It is obvious neither will stop.

Eventually I see Todd ripped apart by close to 30 zombies as the necromancer begs him to stop and he is just screaming like an animal. The shredded remains of dozens more zombies around him remind me of a mass grave. Even then, more die as he thrashes and fights. 

The video continues while the action pauses.  A voiceover shows up. It is the necromancer. “If you look at the bottom left of this frame, you can see his hand crawling away. I saw it when it happened.”

The video continues and a zombie grabs the hand. It goes to bite it but he yells “Stop.” It does. He walks over and grabs the hand. “You were never my enemy, Todd. I was just a poor friend to Carl. I couldn’t save him. And I should not have used him for research.  I am sorry, Todd, the Fox of Yorkshire, King of the Trolls.”

I see and hear Todd gasp. I also see the change immediately. Oh no, I know his true name now. He looks at me, tears in his eyes.

“I remember. I remember being a bane on the knights that hunted me as I hunted them. I remember one saying I was as crafty as a todde. That was what they called foxes at the time. I remember getting that mantle of power and being so much more. I lost those memories when my brain was destroyed in that attack on Frank. He realized it would happen. He kept this to remind me when he found me…”

I am not sure what to say to this being. One who is kind. I settle on putting a hand on his shoulder.

He shakes off the melancholy. “Let’s find our friend. I know someone that owes me a favor for some juicy info I gave her…” He makes a call.

A few minutes later I am looking at a miniature Fae.  She is half a foot tall at the most and though she is proportioned like a woman, I cannot help but feel protective of her. Her glamour is impressive.

“You are turning in that coin for the info?” She is all business.

Todd nods. He hands her a coin. She smiles.

“The Queen of Air and Darkness has declared a human Archmage to be given sanctuary by the Winter Court not eighteen hours ago. He is a necromancer. He is also at the sanctioned human dwellings on the Court grounds, entertaining his hostess.”

Todd nods. “Bargain well made, you little scamp. I would have gotten this off the rumor mill at the CaFae on my next shift and you know it…”

She laughs. He winks and gets up.

“Let’s go to Court, buddy.”

“Um, the sunlight in the first world will kill me.”

He chuckles. “I know a way that is fine, just have to wait until night usually. It turns to day when our day does so we still have a few hours, come on.”

I have to know something…

“You can survive almost anything right?”

“Yea, but decapitation has problems and being too destroyed is a worry. My soul may pick a part to inhabit and use it, but that doesn’t mean my memories transfer. I couldn’t remember anything beyond around 40 years ago until this helped.”

“Oh. Crap.”

“Yea if they decap me and the head with my memories grows a body while my body grows a new head the two parts will try to merge by eating the other. Which do you think has the advantage?”

“The body because it finishes growing a head faster so it is… oh shit.”

“A troll’s phenomenal regen can be a real pain. Speaking of, let’s go visit one.”

I love dogs, but this dog is… a lot. Hyper, untrained, and apparently capable of opening doors like a raptor in Jurassic Park.

A few months ago, she begged me to watch him for a weekend while she went on a trip with her friends. I said yes because I wanted to be nice. HUGE mistake.

In 48 hours, her dog
	•	chewed the corner off my coffee table,
	•	pulled down my curtains,
	•	somehow got into my pantry and ate an entire bag of flour (my kitchen looked like a crime scene),
	•	and knocked over a plant so thoroughly that I think he intentionally tried to bury something in the soil.

When she came to pick him up, I calmly explained everything and showed her photos. She laughed and said, “He’s just spirited! Besides, it’s kind of your fault for not keeping things out of reach.”
…Ma’am. Curtains?

She didn’t offer to pay for anything, but I didn’t push it because I hate conflict.

Fast-forward to this week. She’s going on another trip and texted me, not asked, saying, “I’ll drop him off Friday morning!” I told her no — nicely at first — but when she kept insisting, I finally said, “I’m not dealing with the destruction again. Find a sitter.”

She blew up, saying I’m “punishing her for having a dog,” that “family helps family,” and that I’m being dramatic because “he’s not that bad.” She is now telling everyone I’m selfish and unreliable.

My parents think I could “just deal with it for two days” to keep the peace, but I genuinely don’t want to spend the entire weekend guarding my house from her furry wrecking ball.

Life gets busy, people move, routines change, and suddenly you realize you don’t have as many people to grab a drink with, explore new spots with, or just talk about life with. And honestly? It’s harder than anyone warned us it would be.

I’m at a point where I really miss genuine connection — good conversations, shared humor, having someone to send random memes to, spontaneous plans, or even chill low-key hangs. I take care of myself physically and mentally, and I’m the kind of person who loves making others feel seen, appreciated, and welcomed. That part of me doesn’t go away, even when social circles shrink.

I’m hoping to meet people who are in the same boat — someone who knows what they want out of friendships, who’s easy to talk to, and who’s also craving more meaningful, reliable connections in their 30s.

The first few days of the cold turkey were okay, it felt like I was starting to deal with the actual withdrawals. Brain fog hit hard which led to a lot of depression. I didn’t mind the headaches or sluggishness as I’ve dealt with worse physical pains.
Every once in a while I’ll feel happy, but then anxiety kicks in because.. “Where’s my coffee?” Type of moment. And I start to self monitor my behavior, then that caffeine withdrawal brain fog rolls in and it’s just a big mess. It’s messing up my motivation to do anything or even be happy in anything which has been affecting my relationships with friends, family, and especially my SO

Man I love my SO so much and I just haven’t been treating her the best due to my *nowadays* lack of wanting to be there for anyone, it sucks.

Caffeine to me gave me the feeling of happiness when I didn’t need to be/know I could be, if not that, it would amplify happiness to the max. Before caffeine I was always cheery and grateful about something, but nowadays it’s been rough. It feels like caffeine replaced my every reason to be happy and it was stripped away. And if happy moments come into my life, I would only hold onto it for so long. But caffeine also induced heavy panic attacks at times and anxious episodes for no reason whatsoever, which was the reasoning for my stop.

Just need some word of advice as it’s been getting hard trying to see the light of things. It’s only been a week and a few days and it feels like hell. Really reconsidering hopping back on

Somewhat late Tuesday night, to make sure that my unknown number would not be confused by spam, as it was imperative that they'd pick up. For what reason? Frankly, none in particular. I just enjoy the man's voice, and I hadn't heard it in a long while. It is soft, like fleece. Grey fleece, to be exact; matches his at times anemic, at times intense personality, I guess. Anyway, the deed was done, as I pressed the ""call"" button without giving myself enough time to second guess. Even though I tend to embrace my own idiocy most times, I felt uneasy. I knew I'd be a bother, but I was scared he'd let me know that. My, it would break my heart.

He did actually pick up, and I said ""Hi"". Even before his response, I felt that comfortable flush of nostalgia you can only get from people you don't see much. I opened my heart for a moment, and dwelled on the memory of him once calling me ""mean"", in a playful tone, using one of my old names. You see, I have had many. And yet, somehow, I did not feel like any of them referred to me. ""You're so mean, G"". ""You're so mean, C"". ""You're so mean, F"". None of these words seemed to reach me; to reach me, they'd need to use my real name, but alas, I never felt like I had one. As expected, neither did the words of my grey-fleece-voiced friend that day, but I remembered them anyway. ""How can you be so mean if you're so pretty? You're such an ogre..."".

Right, I was someone who could cause a little bit of whiplash. I doubt he thought about it much, as it was nothing but a tease, but I did. Was I really mean? Was I a person whose name, face and demeanor do not match who I felt I was inside?

I heard him getting impatient, as I hadn't yet answered his ""Who's this?"" question. However, I hadn't made up my mind yet on what I was going to say. I felt like asking if we could meet for coffee and catch up. I felt like saying that I missed him dearly, and that I wished he felt that way too. I felt like asking if we would still be friends if I could be as gentle as I look. ""Was it why you couldn't stay?"", ""Did I do something wrong?"", ""Can we try again sometime?"", I thought. I thought that I could maybe put a name to my folly of calling someone I hadn't seen in years. I could take a leap of faith and say, ""Weren't we birds of a feather? We need to flock together. Did you forget?"".

But then, I realized he did not recognize my voice.

I softened my grip on my phone for a moment. I decided to say I called the wrong number by mistake, apologize and end the call.",1,1763738628.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I never really thought about using it before since I usually stick to Hinge or Bumble, but I wanted to switch things up a bit. The setup was simple and fast, but I noticed right away that the app feels a little different, especially with that carousel style where you swipe yes or no. I thought it was just another gimmick, but I actually matched with someone through it in the first couple of days.

We ended up talking for about a week before meeting up for coffee. It felt pretty natural, which surprised me since Zoosk wasn’t even on my radar until recently. The bigger issue I’ve noticed is that the activity level seems lower than what I’m used to on other apps. Some matches don’t reply at all and a few profiles look like they haven’t been touched in ages.

It makes me wonder if it’s just my area or if Zoosk’s user base is smaller than the bigger apps. I’m still unsure if it’s something worth keeping long term or if it eventually slows down after the first wave of matches.

If you’ve used Zoosk lately I’m curious how it worked out for you. Did it stay consistent or did the momentum drop off after a while?",1,1763738553.0,DatingTips,0,1.0,False

link in comments.

We’re launching a e-commerce coffee brand startup, and instead of paying for Shopify (roughly $39+/month plus transaction fees) or dealing with WooCommerce, I built our entire e-commerce website using Next.js. Total monthly cost now? About $15 for coffee dropshipping api – and no platform middleman. 

Why I did it: We’re bootstrapped, and I hated the idea of losing margins to subscription fees. Plus, I have a coding background. How it’s going: The site is in test mode. I'm eager to get eyes and interest on it. Looking for feedback as well... 

That said. I have a bigger goal to help non-profits, charities, churches. 

If you represent any of these and are looking for a fundraising vehicle with low maintenance costs then open to collab.

And yeah, that’s part of it. But your actual sleep setup plays a way bigger role than most of us realize.

If you're waking up tired, sore, or just not rested, it might not be you, it might be your bed quietly ruining your life. Here’s a breakdown of the main things I’ve found are worth rethinking if you're trying to actually feel rested when you wake up.


1. **Mattress**: Your Foundation Is Probably Lying to You

If your mattress is more than 7–10 years old, sags in the middle, or makes your back sore? That’s your first red flag. You don’t have to go luxury but you do need something that supports your spine and doesn’t overheat.
Why it matters: Your spine alignment during sleep affects everything back pain, shoulder tension, even how deeply you stay asleep.

Options to check out:
>Zinus Green Tea: budget memory foam option that works surprisingly well if you're upgrading from an old spring mattress.

>EGO White Memory Foam Mattress: good mid range pick that doesn’t trap heat and has a balanced, medium firm feel.

>Avocado Green: if you want something more eco conscious with natural latex.


2. **Pillow**: The Unsung Hero of Neck Pain (or Relief)
The pillow you sleep on affects your neck, shoulders, and even jaw. If your pillow goes flat, bunches up, or forces your head into a weird angle, it’s going to mess with your sleep no matter how good your mattress is.
Why it matters: Proper neck alignment = deeper sleep, fewer headaches, and not waking up feeling like you got hit with a frying pan.
One that gets recommended a lot:

 >[Honeydew Classic Scrumptious Pillow](https://d1vsa0evaa8kw9.cloudfront.net/?q=DXMM1131) :
 This one comes up constantly in sleep threads, and for good reason. It’s designed specifically with back and stomach sleepers in mind, which already narrows the field (most pillows tend to favor side sleepers). The fill is a cooling copper gel blend, and what makes it stand out is that it’s fully adjustable you can remove or shift the fill to get the height just right for your neck and sleeping position.It’s not cheap but people who’ve tried a bunch of options and still struggle with neck pain or waking up uncomfortable tend to land on this one as a long term fix. The shape is also slightly curved which helps keep your head and spine aligned if you sleep flat or switch positions during the night. Doesn’t hurt that it comes with a matching pillowcase that actually fits it properly too (rarely the case with oddly shaped pillows). (linked it cos its from a small business so you might have trouble finding it)


3. **Bedding & Sheets**: Breathability Over Thread Count
You don’t need 1,000 thread count sheets. You do need sheets that let your body breathe and regulate heat. If you wake up sweaty or tangled, it’s probably not just you your sheets may be trapping heat or sticking too much.
Why it matters: Your body needs to cool slightly to enter deep sleep. Overheating literally pulls you out of it.

Things that work well:
> Brooklinen Classic Percale Sheets: crisp, breathable


> Quince Linen Sheets: slightly more textured, good airflow


4. **Duvet/Comforter**: Heavier Isn’t Always Better
Lots of people use thick duvets or comforters that are better suited to winter camping than actual sleep. Look for something temperature regulating and seasonally appropriate.
Why it matters: Like sheets, your comforter plays a huge role in whether you overheat or sleep comfortably through the night.

Popular picks:
> Buffy Breeze: lightweight and cooling


> Down Alternative Comforter by Utopia: budget-friendly and washable


> Weighted blanket : not for everyone, but some people swear by it for calming anxiety and improving sleep quality


5. **Mattress Topper** (If You’re Not Replacing the Whole Mattress)

If a new mattress isn’t in the budget, a topper can actually make a big difference in support and comfort especially if your current mattress is too firm or too soft.
Why it matters: It's the fastest fix if your bed is actively working against you.

Solid options:
> Viscosoft Foam Topper: adds plushness and reduces pressure


> Lucid lavender Infused Topper: budget-friendly with cooling features


Final Thoughts
None of these things are magic fixes on their own, but they add up. If you’ve never paid attention to your bedding setup before, starting with any one of these can make a bigger difference than you’d expect. I didn’t think I’d care about sleep gear now. I kind of want to give my past self a shake for just accepting bad sleep for so long.
Hope this helps anyone else in the “why am I still tired?” camp.

I thought it would be difficult for me to conceive and we actually got pregnant the first month. We weren’t actively trying, but decided to see what would happen.

I used Zyns and the second I found out I was pregnant, I quit cold turkey. It’s been a week and I don’t even miss it, which is shocking because I smoked and vaped for years before switching to Zyn, so was definitely a nicotine fiend. I also immediately started taking prenatals and eating as healthy as I could. I quit caffeine except for a cup or decaf coffee in the mornings.

Tuesday, I started having small gushes of blood with some clots. Not heavy cramping, in fact it doesn’t even feel like period cramps, just a constant pull, but I’ve passed several clots and a varying color of blood (brown, pink, red). It tends to ebb and flow and sometimes stops entirely before another gush.

I went in for an ultrasound after explaining my symptoms. The gestational sac was present but not the yolk (I was estimated to be 5w5d). There is concern I am ectopic, it’s early and nothing could be seen, or I’m miscarrying. I go back today but have been worried sick.

Has anyone else experienced similar bleeding? Could my use of Zyns caused the miscarriage? I just feel so sad.",2,1763737777.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

I have family that lives in my building so they don't really buy the excuse about me being too busy for a cup of coffee with them once a week. This started last year when I was going through a break-up with my fiancé, the week we were supposed to get married. It was my third failed engagement; I was humiliated and the pain was too much to hide. Plus my friends all had their first babies around that time so I definitely couldn't talk about it with them. That was the kicker, all my friends being happily married and loving motherhood, while I basically left at the alter. Anyways I started to feel better as the months went by, but even simple things like going to take out the trash would take a lot of energy out of me.  Even now I get all my groceries delivered and probably leave the house once a month, someone even comes to pick up the trash too which is helpful. 

I was doing a bit better with handling social interactions  until last month when my beloved grandma passed and now, I just don't want to be around anyone. The only person I can handle talking to is my mom. I know now, that I have every right to give myself all the time I need to grieve. In some ways losing my grandma brought up my break up which was around this time last year. You know, how you can love someone so much and then one day you have the last conversation you'll ever have with them and then they're gone forever. 

  
Besides needing to vent, I guess I just wanted help on not feeling guilty about avoiding my family who I love. They're caring and mean well so it has nothing to do with them. I just don't want anyone to see me. I don't have anything to give anyone right now. Maybe that's what scares me, the idea of someone seeing how empty I am, when I used to always be energetic and talkative. 

It's like the person I used to be died and I don't know how to break the news to anyone, because I know how much they loved her. I've gotten so much better at communicating, but I still haven't learned how to say I'm not okay.

I’m planning my first meetups for Portuguese and Spanish. I’ve been scouting possible locations but would also love your suggestions since I moved here fairly recently and don’t know every nook and cranny of the neighborhood yet.

For at least the first meetups, I’d ideally like the following:

- A location open most of the day on Saturdays and Sundays.

- Enough space to accomodate everyone around a big round table (maybe plus additional chairs pulled around if the group is larger) or smaller tables pushed together (similar setup).

- A location that could benefit from the increased traffic and where attendees could get coffee, tea, etc. at a minimum — light fare a bonus (bagels, pastries, other sweets, etc.) For the first meetings, I prefer no alcoholic beverages. 

- Fairly calm and quiet since we all need to hear each other speak!!

After our first meeting(s), I’ll have a better idea of serious interest, maybe splitting into language levels, and other plans for hopefully continuing the program.

Hope that this finds you all well.  @PNWest is nearing the end of this chapter of his time here in beautiful Central Oregon.  Mrs PNWest & I will be moving in a couple of weeks to the Vancouver, WA area where there should be less treacherous winter weather conditions and hopefully less chance of wild fires.  Bend is an absolute perfect place for younger retirees but almost everyone we met when we first got here has now moved on to gentler climes.  We're 14 years older than when we got here and as much as I hate to admit it I've slowed down.  We've seen too many people our age fall/get sick/need joint replacements/etc and figure that the time to get out is when you are still healthy enough to do so.  The idea of needing to cross the mountains to get specialized medical care which has happened to several friends worries us.  We've been lucky but as we age it is only a matter of time.  I'll try to keep up these weekly reports at least for a while, old habits are hard to break and I enjoying doing them.  In the past I've posted some of the reports from Europe as well as from San Jose, Los Angeles, Portland and Seattle so this shouldn't be a problem.  If any of you young bloods want to take over I'll be glad to hand over the reigns.  Anyway enough with the verbiage - here's the report.

I woke up at 5:45 AM, snoozed twice, dragged myself to the kitchen for coffee and a quick snack, now I regret it, because the nausea is setting in and my long commute hasn't even begun this year. The humdrum spins again in its incessant refrain until it eventually decrescendoes into nothingness.

At least my dad is dropping me off at \[unnamed location\]. Small mercies... I guess.

I don't know why I give off this... *vibe*? I'm too tired to sift meaning out of the blur. Too tired to greet the fictional ""New Year, New Me"" who'll probably end up 3 years late anyway. By 7:37 AM, after a labyrinthine ride on XXX bus, I've arrived, already drained, and the day hasn't even started.

I've been listening to the same Vocaloid playlist on shuffle, using it to dissociate. I barely registered the world passing by.  
What a way to start the year...  
Does the earth even care that we try to ascribe meaning to its meaningless orbit? That's we're so painfully aware of our insignificance and yet still claw at some escape?

I ran into \[name\], exchanged the awkward hug and the predictable ""long time no see"", then the obligatory ""I missed you, how was your holiday?"" Just another way to torture myself with the illusion that everyone else's life is seemingly brighter than mine. OMG that sounds so fun!! I was thinking of killing myself on the night of my birthday!!

And then I bumped into \[name\] , who kept talking, kept asking, even as I subtly begged to leave.  
Social cues. Social cues... How many smiles do I have to fake before I split open?

I hate futile human interaction; this endless improvised choreography. I hate needing a voice, a face, a facade to express anything. I want disembodied communication, soul to soul. ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" won't mean anything when my book doesn't even *have* a cover.

I'm perpetually stuck in chapter one, abridging the errant strokes of an unwritten autobiography, of someone who never even existed.

It's lunch break. Still overwhelmed by the pressure I'm supposed to eat. People call this a ""daily routine"", but nothing about constant suffering feels routine. Maybe the world has morphed into an amorphous blur and I can't tell what's real anymore.

Network class is looming. It's overwhelming. I don't want to study. I don't even want to be here.

It's 1:54 PM. I forced myself to finish the sandwich I bought— wasteful, unnecessary, and is now sitting heavily in me. I shouldn't have spent money on food I didn't want, only to eat it out of guilt and then fight the urge to get rid of it.

I feel increasingly lonely and uneasy around everyone, strangers, acquaintances... friends or not, I don't even know the difference. Maybe I've only ever shared surface-level fragments of myself, the parts that felt safe enough to exist. Maybe my ""personality"" is something I still haven't deciphered myself. And though it feels like I'm making progress, everything still feels utterly wrong, hopelessly wrong.

I'm in the wrong place, studying for a degree I never wanted, praying I never get swallowed whole by the devouring gale of adulthood...",2,1763737430.0,storyttttelling,0,1.0,False

recently, i have been becoming increasingly dissatisfied in our relationship. i am still fine to pay for most of our expenses, but recently these expenses have been a lot of take out and weed, not dates out or things like that. i feel like hes putting in less and less effort, and ive told him multiple times that i want to do more and see more from him but hes always blamed it on his financial situation. for example, i commented on the fact that he hasn’t bought me flowers since july, something i have always been very verbal about really treasuring, and he blamed it on his financial situation. ive been showing him videos of how to make bouquets from flowers from grocery shops and he just ignores them. he doesn’t really like going out to dinner because he says he doesn’t want to pay for the bus or uber to go there, and the same with any dates out really. i can barely get him to go on a walk with me, all he’s interested in is smoking weed, getting drunk, playing video games, and having sex. 

not only that, but when he gets money, spending it on me is the last thing he thinks of. recently he received £100 from a bank sign up bonus and spent it on sending his friend beer and a cart. like come on now. i’ve been showering this man with presents (got him some high quality art supplies because he likes to paint that he HASN’T USED, lego’s, clothes etc) and he can barely buy me a drink when we’re at the club. 

i dont know how to communicate any of this without sounding like a bit of a brat. i dont even want him to spend loads on me i just want some quality time together. like 10 minutes ago i asked him if he wanted to go and get coffee and he said he wasn’t up for it because he was eating fruit… like. i genuinely dont know what to do. i enjoy getting high and video games but not every single day. sometimes i just want to get hot chocolate and walk around and talk. how do i get this across to him and let him know how serious it is without sounding entitled and spoiled?",2,1763737403.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False
1p30wyi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p30wyi,AIO my fiance jokingly pushed me during a small argument and I expressed to him that it upset me,"My fiancé and I had a small argument outside our front door last night. He told me I was having an attitude towards him around our friend and I told him I was annoyed because he was trying to push my buttons. 

For context, he’s been working insane hours the last few weeks and hasn’t had a day off. He gets up at 7am and isn’t home til 11pm. I have a lot of sympathy for how stressed and busy he is, but it impacts me too. I miss him and I’m afraid to tell him that too often because it stresses him out when he feels like he’s not doing enough for me. In my defense, he doesn’t seem to be focused on me at all. Work is consuming him and any drop of affection seems like a chore to him. 

Back to last night. He came home from work around 11:30pm and he has a friend in town that I was trying to entertain all day until he got home. I was exhausted and really just wanted to go to bed, but he wanted to stay up late to talk to his friend. Totally understandable. The first thing that rubbed me the wrong way was my fiancé completely interrupting and dismissing me in a conversation so I gave him a funny look and he said “what’s your problem??”. I was taken aback and shook my head and walked away. Then he said something about “don’t ever get a girlfriend, stay single forever!” jokingly to his friend about something else as a cut to me, I think about how I took time away from their gaming when we first started dating. I kind of turned off my social battery at that point and went outside to take the trash out. I was walking back up the stairs when he came outside and told me stop having an attitude. I told him how he made me feel and he mocked me and proceeded to bend over and shove me with one hand. I fell back off the bottom two steps but he grabbed my arm before I actually fell to the ground. I looked at him in shock and he walked away laughing. I was over it and went to get ready for bed. I texted him the video of him pushing me to reiterate that I wasn’t cool with it, and maybe watching it back would help him understand how I felt. I won’t show the video for privacy reasons but it’s  as I described. He mocks me, shoves me with one hand, I fall, he grabs me with the other arm, and I stand there looking at him saying “wtf that’s not cool” and he walks away cackling and goes back inside.

He apologized over text while he was in the other room and that made me feel better. But then he came to our room and told me he couldn’t believe how dramatic I was being and I pushed back. I stood my ground and told him it hurt my feelings and just wanted a genuine apology and he continued to make me feel like I was insane. He shut the conversation down completely and said “nah nah nah I’m done, this is bullshit and I’m not gonna have you act like I’m abusing you”. I told him again that I wasn’t acting that way or accusing him of anything more than what happened, but he refused to hear me out and walked away to hang out with our friend.

The argument continued this morning when he got ready for work without acknowledging me and I felt sad. He asked me what was wrong, I told him I missed him and I’m sad that we spent our time arguing. He essentially told me I was being dramatic and embarrassing him and he left with our friend. 

It just hurts to feel so dismissed and like I’m insane for having any feelings. This is fairly common with us. I don’t feel safe expressing myself because he always takes it as an attack. It also sucks knowing that he stayed home 30 min later than usual because our friend was taking a shower before they went to get coffee. Normally he’ll rush out of the house and barely give me a second thought. I’m just feeling extra lonely and like I’m not a priority. It hurts and I definitely get emotional but I don’t know if he’s right and I’m handling this poorly and should just suck it up while he has other things to worry about.",1,1763737398.0,AmIOverreacting,13,1.0,False

*Date, Standardized Terran Time; December 25th, 2078, 5:00 AM USEST*

I woke up with a giddy excitement i hadn't felt since forever. I loved Christmas, one of the only times of year when families actually got together and made something out of the hell hole many of us call home. I slowly got up, seeing many of my squad mates and brothers in arms already up, sharing what little supplies of hot cocoa and coffee we had left, waiting for everyone to get up. The Arxur fleet left the night prior, so we started celebrating our beloved holiday. I made my way over to Sarah, who was just waking up herself. ""Hey."" She said with a yawn, myself giving her a nod as I sat next to her, shivering a little. ""Kinda cold today."" I commented, making Sarah laugh. ""Yeah, it kinda is. It fits, tough. At least with us."" She said, sitting up on her cot. She and I have been friends since we were five, and didn't want to ruin it with the population program, of which all persons must either have a partner or they will be assigned one. 

The only ones exempt from this mandatory drive were servicemembers, since the focus was family building, not just population, so it was up to the people holding the guns if they wanted to have a kid before fighting a Terminator. Sarah and I definitely didn't want that, so we joined who would take us based on our skills. I wanted to be a diplomat, but I had to give up my education on the matter to serve. Sarah wanted to be a scientist, and more or less got her wish by joining the Research and Hacking Division, she just works a lot with computers now.

I nudge her and gesture to the main tree near the city center. Nearly all of us had smaller trees with other presents, but those were for different divisions, squads, and ranks. The big tree is for everyone. Sarah and I made our way over, along with most others as everyone was awake by now. Kam and Tarva were also nearby, wanting to observe our traditions, no doubt. Our logistics guys got to the front and it became like mail call. Service was spotty on Earth, so many still wrote letters to loved ones in different cities and on the field. Packages were handed to patient recipients, and sometimes people were given more than one from under the big tree. I, personally had 3 presents from different people, Sarah having 4. Sarge had 2, but he seemed content. I mosied my way over to my squads tree, most of them already being there or were getting settled.

""Hey, ya fackin' wanka, ya wrapped this thing horribly, mate."" Said Robert Hardwin, part of the Australian Republican Army. He was like if an Italian New Yorker had a baby with an Australian from Queensland, and it got both accents plus slamg from both. But he was funnier than fuck, so I wanted to give him a joke book. I did run out of wrapping paper when getting to his, though, so the word 'Joke' was clearly seen. ""Hey, man, it's the thought that counts."" Said the third American in the squad, Hobart Jackson. He was a chill guy, but he was a beast in the field. Considering he had a Machine Gun most of the time, it made sense, but he was still cool all the same.

The other four were my friends and squad mates, too, Ivan, Red Army Remnants, Gunter, German Imperial Army, Bull, His Majesty's Royal Resistance Movement, and Hoang, Viet Mihn. And, of course, Sarge, US Army, like myself. Once everything was settled, we all began unwrapping. I did notice Tarva nearby, but i didn't pay her looking any mind. I first pulled out something from Hardwin, A book on 'mental self improvement'. I gave him a dirty look as he snickered, grabbing the next present from Sarge. It was a coffee mug with the word *I like to STEAL*, and next to each letter was a set of words that said, Strategically Transfer Equipment to Alternate Location. I chuckled, because I *did* sometimes steal stuff for the squad, by either swindling some poor lodgi guy or just up and taking it. He chuckled warmly as he unwrapped a helmet that said 'Best NCO ever'.

Ivan got me 2000 proof Vodka, saying that he'd had gotten better if there was better stuff in stock. I thanked him regardless. He also expressed gratitude after i gave him Moonshine of thr same caliber. Bull got me a hard cover of 1984, saying he had an extra copy and heard me mention wanting to read it. I high fived him, since I got him one of the few Harry Potter books I could get my hands on. Jackson gave me a new Smartphone, expressing that newer phones were dainty and easily breakable. I thanked him and smiled when he got excited over the gun cleaning kit I got him. Hoang have me an actual, honest to God *Mango*. I damn near jumped for joy as I whipped out my knife and began cutting, taking a bite out of the fresh fruit. Real Fruit was a rarity, especially since most agricultural fields were burned by Skynet to starve us, so a fruit like this must have cost hom a pretty penny. He seemed satisfied with the new machete I got him, but it seemed like it got the better gift.

I opened Sarah's next, finding a badass laptop that had a few games on it. I pumped my fist in the air, knowing she'd like the 'Code Genius' book i got her. Now it was down to Gunter's present. It was small and rectangular. I almost frowned, thinking it was just a protein brick. I unwrapped the gift paper and nearly dropped it. ""Gunter..."" I began, just as he was beginning to open the pack of history themed playing cards I got him. ""Ja?"" He replied, making a pleasantly surprised sound at the cards. ""Is this... *real*?"" I ask in disbelief, hands shaking as I held an actual chocolate bar. ""Ja, it is. Mein mutter owns eins of the final few schokolade factories in ze welt."" He said smiling, my friends going wide eyed as they looked at the bar. Chocolate was nigh impossible to find, and those who did have it, were *beyond rich*. Chocolate cannot be made in any sort of large capacity anymore because of the near nonexistent nature of Natural Sugar and Cocoa Beans. He essentially just gave me fucking gold for Christmas. If I sold this bar, I would be set for fifteen generations of wealth. I quickly stowed it in my coat, baffled, yet not wanting anyone else to see it. 

I looked behind me and saw Tarva, who seemed to be confused. ""Was that thing important?"" She asked, Jackson stepping in for me. ""Y-yeah, it was. Candy is near nonexistent because of how fucked our agriculture is. Just to create a single bar like that now? It would cost millions just to make."" He said, the Venlil seeming surprised. ""But... why?"" She asked, making me speak up. ""Skynet. They destroyed our agricultural system to starve us. We're barely getting by on our BRs."" I said, making her make a weird face. I began to elaborate. ""Brick Rations. The white bricks you see us eat? That's what most humans eat. Normal food is in such short supply, only the wealthy, lucky, and government get it. Regular Joe's like us get the bricks."" I explained, making Tarva seemed horrified. I'd be horrified too if the roles were reversed. She stepped closer and hugged me, taking me by surprise. ""No one should go through that. Not even Predators like you."" She said, my uniform shirt muffling her.

Kam was nearby and went to pull her off me, but she let go after a moment. ""S-sorry. It's just... i can't imagine..."" she began, only for Hobart to snort. ""Oh yeh, no food and loosing friends to the machines every day fucks up yer moral system. 'S why we aren't real emotional anymore. No more tears to give."" He said, causing nearly all of us to look at him, the guy putting up his hands. ""Can't puss out when facts are involved."" He said before I sighed. He wasn't wrong, but hopefully, with this truce with Legion, maybe we can be better, like how we used to.",9,1763737385.0,NatureofPredators,1,1.0,False

I stayed at Hotel B during a trip to Lima, and it’s one of those rare places that quietly stays with you.

Not because it’s flashy or overly designed,  but because everything feels considered.

The hotel is set in a restored Belle Époque mansion, once a private residence, now reimagined as a small art hotel. The building itself is a work of art: tall doors, soft light through stained glass, and a sense of time that moves slower than the city outside.

The first thing you notice isn’t the lobby or the rooms…It’s the art. The hotel collaborates with local galleries and collectors, so each corridor feels like a curated exhibition. You could easily spend an afternoon just walking the halls, discovering photography, sculpture, and pieces by Peruvian artists you probably haven’t heard of yet.

Rooms are spacious, elegant without excess. Think hardwood floors, crisp linens, freestanding tubs, and balconies shaded by jacarandas. The minibar is stocked with pisco and chocolate from the Andes.

The restaurant downstairs, El Restaurante, is worth a visit even if you’re not staying there. Mornings start with coffee and fresh fruit under sunlight filtered through linen curtains; evenings are for pisco sours and quiet conversation.

Barranco itself is the perfect neighborhood for this kind of stay. Full of galleries, cafés, and a creative calm that contrasts with Miraflores’ buzz. From Hotel B, you can walk to MATE (Mario Testino’s photography museum), MAC Lima, or the Puente de los Suspiros at sunset.

Hotel B isn’t the kind of luxury that tries to impress you. It’s the kind that lets you slow down, notice details, and feel like you’re inhabiting a story.

Would I stay again? Absolutely. It’s one of the few hotels where “boutique” still means something.

Let's be real. We've all been there: You like someone. You want to ask them out. But then your brain turns into a thesaurus trying to find a word for ""date"" that sounds less terrifying. ""Hangout""? ""Vibe-","**STOP OVERTHINKING IT:**

Let's be real. We've all been there: You like someone. You want to ask them out. But then your brain turns into a thesaurus trying to find a word for ""date"" that sounds less terrifying. ""Hangout""? ""Vibe-check""? ""Casual meeting of two humans in the same location to exchange atoms and feelings?""

STOP. That's the **Absurd Aloofness** trap. It's why we waste weeks sending mixed signals only to end up disappointed.

Here is the brutal, simple, and effective wisdom from people who've actually done this right. This approach is about achieving clarity, confidence, and zero drama when you take that step.

# The Single Most Important Word: DATE (Seriously, Use It)

Forget the ambiguity. Ambiguity doesn't protect you; it just guarantees a confusing, lukewarm experience.

If your intent is a date, use the word **""date.""** Instead of: *""Hey, want to hang out sometime?""* try: *""Hey, I enjoy talking to you. Would you like to go on a* ***date*** *with me? I'm free this Saturday afternoon for burgers.""*

A specific, low-key suggestion (like burgers, coffee, or a chill activity) makes it easy to say yes. It shows you're spontaneous, not desperate.

# The Pre-Date Vibe Check: Don't Be a Tinder Stalker

We've been lied to by 30 years of Rom-Coms. You don't need a three-act play of intense, witty banter before you ask someone out. But you also can't walk up to a stranger and demand they follow you into the woods.

A few **relaxed, non-committal chats** are your **minimum due diligence**. The goal is simple: Do you share interests? Are they *not* immediately setting off emergency sirens? Great. That's all you need. If you know they love a specific activity (hiking, a band, a local café), use that to craft the *specific* date proposal. It shows genuine interest, not just a desperate fishing expedition.

# Graceful Deflection: The 'No Chance' Jedi Mind Trick

Rejection is the bogeyman, but here's the secret: It only *kills* the interaction if **YOU** freak out.

If they say, *""Aww, that's sweet, but no thanks,""* the winning script is: *""No problem at all! Thanks for letting me know.""* (Then change the subject or politely wrap up the conversation.)

The Vicious Truth: Insisting, pleading, or getting visibly upset is the *only* thing that makes the interaction truly awkward and guarantees they tell all their friends. When you accept the 'no' instantly, you keep your **dignity** and your **Blue Peter Badge**. You win.

# Clarity is Your Confidence Superpower

Why does being direct feel less awkward? Because it takes away the guessing game that everyone hates.

|| || |\*\*The Old Way (Awkward)**|**The New Way (Confident)\*\*| |Pondering their mixed signals.|Knowing exactly where you stand.| |Focusing on the fear of rejection.|Focusing on the clarity of your intent.|

The worst possible outcome is a single, one-syllable word that you will forget by next week. The better outcome is a date. You literally have nothing to lose except the crushing weight of ""What If.""

1p30qx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1p30qx3/venting_marriage_crisis_advise_anyone/,Venting: marriage crisis advise anyone?,"So, I (34 F) have been married to my husband (34 M) for four years now, but I think I might not want to be with him anymore and it's related to issues I knew he had in the first place.

  
We met in college and have been together for 11 years now (I know it has been a long time to realize the aspects of him I hate now). We started dating on Valentine's day; he took me to a nice restaurant and he used to be all sweet and plan small gestures.

  
I've always had important days in mind whenever I had no money to buy a present for him (broke ass college student) I would make something for him (like a book with good wishes from all of his friends for his birthday), I always put a lot of thought into what I do for him and it excites me to see the joy on someone else's eyes when they are being honored. 

  
As time went by he got annoyed whenever I gave him something for an especial occasion. I know this because he explicitly said so. He didn't like the restaurant I chose, I forgot to invite someone he cared about. The thing is this: when I got him presents for our anniversary he usually was uncomfortable because he didn't get me or planned anything and i did this wonderfulthing (he would still complain about) for him. He looked so sad that I felt even sorry for him. I used to brush it off since I have a lot of issues putting my feelings first.

But on 2019 I consistently asked him what were we doing for our anniversary, he stated he had no money AND that I had no time (this last part was so true, I had a job and I was in the middle of my masters degree and no matter how much I tried I found no way to buy or create something to celebrate us). I left it to him and he picked me up from my classes that night and suggested to go to the supermarket and buy crackers and tuna and eat at my place (I lived with my aunt and cousins back then). I was heartbroken. I mean once he had offered me a date going for an evening picnic in a colonial town close to my home and then going to a theater to see a play (this had a total cost of about 10 dollars-he had 10 dollars to spare btw), why nothing at all? 

I started crying and told him that he knew I really wanted to do something that day or around that date anyways, and although my expectations were so low he still manage to disappoint me. He asked why I didn't do something myself since I'm the one who always plans, pays and execute our anniversary dates and only then I realized not only that, but also that it always came with the cost of him complaining about the smallest inconvenience and spoiling the mood.

I answered that he had more time to spare this year and I was studying, taking classes and busy with work. 

He played stupid (not knowing what to do for anniversaries, not understanding what I liked, not being able to figure out my schedule) and I spared him. I babied him and explained in detail every step of a date (literally I wrote it down with instructions as a message) because poor him so socially awkward.

Next year he proposed on our anniversary (I told him I was NOT going to put in any effort into anything anymore). I felt in my gut that this was a poor attempt to overcompensate in the moment, but brushed off my feelings as usual.

After our wedding he barely spent time home (he had a very difficult schedule at that time), and when at home he refused to interact with me (he sat to watch TV and got annoyed if I dare to even touch him). Sex was great throughout all the relationship, but after we got married he sort of treated me as a rubber doll? He refused my advances and whenever he felt like he came on to me and did his business in less than 3 minutes so I was left confused,  he refused to cuddle or even talk to me afterwards. That went on for a month or two until I snapped and told him next time I was charging him in advance for the services. I honestly was considering to end it by that point, he was also using a tone whenever he addressed me and was visibly annoyed if I talked to him about anything. ​

Unfortunately, I got diagnosed with cancer that year (this stopped me worrying about my relationship and concentrating on healing) it was not a complicated tumor and surgery spare me from needing any additional treatment, but I had to go through some therapy after surgery. I got pregnant right after that.

We now have a beautiful 2 yo son and I noticed him trying to put his emotions and feelings over our son's needs. That is a limit for me. I'm a doormat because my family used to overstep within my boundaries, but that is an absolute no for my child.

He's been all sullen since because I don't pay him as much attention as before after we had our child. Also, because of all the things going on with my health I let him off the grid with the topic about our anniversaries ever since my diagnosis (I'm completely recovered by now). I've booked stays at hotels and resorts and bought presents for him, but not a single effort has been payed on his part. Also he starts guilt tripping me on how hard his life is with his type of work or his relationship with his family (don't even get me started on that topic).

The last big thing that happened (small things happen everyday) was my birthday this year. I booked a resort for us three, there he went shopping for some things he needed, he asked me if I wanted anything from the shop and as soon as I said he said it was too expensive and I didn't need it anyways (I agreed since I wasn't expecting him to buy me anything) he overspent on that shop and on our way back I asked him to stop for a coffee he said that only if I was the one to pay for it. I bought the coffee and something for him, but he knew he was in the wrong and refuse to take it (and a mini drama to gaslight me, that I did him the favor to point out and he ate the damn thing). 

Then he went on and bought an expensive $$$ pillow for himself, but refused to buy one for me. That's when I realized that I other than a congratulations I hadn't received anything from him through this whole weekend. And this hotel is more that 500 per person per night and is the 3rd I payed for is this year (he earns more than double than me and he pays for 50% of the bills at home).

There is more than a thousand stories like these, but I think you get the message. 

I'm annoyed, but it's not about the money. It's about the effort. I think I'm telling him we get couples therapy (I'm willing to try for the sake of our child, on the know that it harms him to be around a cheap dad all the time) AND he is the one who must pay.

PS: Obviously he's got good traits too, but

Coffee has officially replaced sleep as my main emotional support. My chair is my therapist. My stapler is judging me. And yet somehow, I’m expected to be productive.

For the past 3 years, we've been a members only studio, and have made zero dollars, but do it out of love. This year, we wanted to expand the offering to classes and hopefully pay some of our bills and have enough money for coffee, so we introduced 3 wheel courses open to the community. 

For the first round of classes, teachers insisted on students firing unlimited work. This meant we fired the kiln over 8 times (4 bisque, 4 glaze) with just student work. We the owners do not get paid, so this was extra time we had to spend at the studio doing it. Our costs also skyrocketed due to the extra firings. And while both of those things are manageable, we just felt bad - we were firing rough, untrimmed work that was bound to get thrown away. Pieces that had cracks or holes, that lacked any sort of use. It all just felt wasteful. 

So, for the next session, we asked our wheel instructors to keep it to 6 pieces per student for free (the class is 6 sessions). After that, students could pay for more firings ($50 per cubic foot). We thought this was fair because it kept both costs in check, but it also taught students what was worthwhile firing and what wasn't. Every piece does not deserve to get fired. 

The other studios in this area all charge for firings in their wheel classes, usually per cubic inch. We want to be generous and have people feel good about their work made, and have that be included in the class, but we feel that unlimited firings are a bit unreasonable. 

That said, it's only our third month doing classes, so we don't know what we don't know. This is why I wanted to ask this community if you could share your experiences and let us know what is reasonable. ",10,1763736766.0,Pottery,20,0.92,False

My Delonghi Dedica is now 12 years old. Throughout the years I have upgraded it with unpressurized IMS baskets. I use a K6 KinGrinder.

Drinks I make/usage:
Mainly americano’s (95%) and sometimes milk drinks (Flat White) for family and friends. Because the steamwand on the Dedica sucks and in the rare occasion I make milk drinks I have to make multiple at once, I use a french press to manually froth a large amount of milk which works surprisingly well!

Beans: Specialty coffee, mostly medium roast. Sometimes a light roast if I’m feeling adventurous.

Budget and location: €400 in Europe

Why do I want to upgrade:
I want something with better thermal stability to get better extraction. I’m reading alot about the benefits of a boiler compared to thermoblock (like the Dedica). Better/more pressure control would be great too. Also with my Dedica pushing 12 years now the thermoblock isn’t functioning at full capacity anymore. Quite sure about that.

Size: I don’t have a big kitchen, which is why I love the Dedica. Would like something with a similar small footprint. I consider machines like Sage Barista Express too big and bulky.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

A lot of stufy dates and we usually eat lunch together.

Okay so the dynamic is like this: The class are composed of mostly girls and I'm quite literally the only straight guy there, the other ones are a bunch of gay dudes and transwomen.

So on the most recent ""date"" we're on a long lunch because we finished finished an activity early, she asked me if she looks fat in her uniform, she doesn't of course but she's worried that her new jersey won't fit her because she gained a few pounds, she asked me to look at her thighs but I said they look fine, I thought it looked sexy but I held off even though I could tell that she wants me to call her hot right ?? Was that a *Social Cue*™ ????

She then showed me a bunch of older pics where she was super skinny, and I told her my honest opinion, she looks better now with a wee bit of fat

STORY FULL GENRES: Dark Fantasy, Psychological Realism, Psychological Fiction, Science Fantasy, Dark Comedy, Horror, Period Piece, Historical Fantasy, Action, Adventure, Cosmic Horror, Grimdark, Tragedy, Coming-of-Age, Prison Drama, Grimdark Fantasy

Nyko's Path is a unique and highly complex dark cosmology with a combination of vintage, realism, dark fantasy and light fantasy alongside offering multiple comedic elements all 4 at the same time taking place in France,

it based on Nyko, a captured Mythical Creature with the appearance of a black fluffy wolf, a pup that evolves very quickly and escaped from the hands of Aaron also known as Gunnar within the story, the Phoenix a divine being 300 million years ago having the powers of omnipotence, omnipresence and omniscience was ambushed by the soldiers of darkness

extremely strong beings that were made along with the existence at the very start, allowing themselves to have resistance to reality-warping and existence erasure, they look almost robotic as you can see the multiverses through them

attacked by every single one existing and so was forced to run into the Reality-Crystal also known as the Crystal of Life he created to hold the whole infinite existence together from being ripped apart

destroying that changed the whole reality and existence, the Phoenix was so massive that when he did this he died and all his blood flew all around the existence, as it destroyed together, allowing himself for reincarnation or at the very least giving up his powers or a fraction of them to someone needed

the blood fell on animals too, mutating them into cosmic+ beings with never seen before powers, the blood that didn't fall on animals or beings, found other drops of blood and created abominations of creatures

over time Humans on earth grew a hate on the creatures, their powers...their abilities and appearance, were...evil in their eyes, due to this, an scientist named ""Rick Morgan"" created a machine in 1778 called the XV9 which allowed humans to become powerful enough to take down a fraction of the creatures

and sold a book of how to make one with the needed tools and everything to other companies, illegal and legal companies were raised, multiple one of them rivaling the other, legal ones wanted to take down those beings while the illegal ones wanted to tell or use them for ritual purposes

John Silverman a man who was 49 years old at the time takes the role of a Mythical Creature hunter wanting to take down those beasts, the cute and harmless ones included, if they look different, they die,

John soon becomes a champion in one of the legal companies named ""MORGAN'S HUNTING COMPANY"" that was also one of the most popular ones, the hunters were praised for their well done job and most of them became famous, John included who soon became one of the most popular champions there,

Morgan soon got killed in 1792 by an electrical creature that shocked him to death at night, who sneaked through hunters into the building, his death was confirmed on July 19 at 11:42PM,

hunter swore that they heard screams they never did before and pleadings but he quickly was found dead, the company didn't stop though, his legacy followed and this one company became even more popular after this on the newspapers, John took the job in 1965 and left in 1969 wanting peace with his family,

he never took the job again and had a fun time with his family...till his wife died, suicided when a illegal huge group of Cultists kept terrorizing their family because of John past of being a champion wanting him to join, after this, he moved towns and got in a forest close to Domme, barricading himself and his only son in the forest

Morgan's body was also stolen at his funeral, hunters went on a mission to find him and they found his body, it was confirmed, abused and played with by creatures, everyone was shocked and their hate for creatures grew,

both kinds hating the other and so life continued with hatred and fights, other people especially the high-ranked champions took Morgan's role, then another one took their role at their death and so on in continue, each one met at the brutal death of a mythical creature, with no mercy as most mythical creatures hated them

About the mythical creatures, each one varies from peak human level to absolute infinite power and omnipotence, there are quadrillions of mythical creatures but only a few hundred millions were discovered and identified, Mythical Creatures varies from whole species about the same one to there being only one

* The cosmology is infinite, with a infinite number of dimensions, from demonic ones to paradises that allow everyone to be happy in there or even ones that are just a massive flower field
* Protagonists: Nyko and James are the 2 protagonists of the story, Nyko the cute wolf pup that just starts to understand life and other things as a young pup, James the son of John
* who keep getting yelled at, abused by his father, drinks to cope and tries hard to seem cool or at least like everyone else, he gave on life at this point...that till Nyko came and all changed

of course for our universe to not get destroyed, a large portion of the phoenix blood made a shield of blood around our universe, so no matter how strong an attack is, earth or our universe won't suffer, other universes weren't so luckily however",1,1763735920.0,worldbuilding,0,0.6,False

\--

Hey guys it’s your man OneManOps again. It’s been months since my last post but man, life has been busy! Things finally slowed down a bit as we head toward the end of the year, so I resumed my hidden-gem-hunting trip throughout Guangzhou.

So I got a bit of a craving for a really good dessert tonight after finishing dinner at home. I’m looking for a NOT-so-Instagrammy type of **real, authentic dessert shop** and found one that just opened last month! Checked the ratings on Dianping: 4.6/5. Ok cool, I’m going!

**Where it is:** It’s near the Wuyangcun 五羊邨 subway station, so if you’re around the area, or if you are in Zhujiang New Town, this is within 10 minutes if you take a cab. Or, if you’re like me who’s a PRO e-bike rider, this is like a 5-minute pleasant late-autumn night ride from home.

The owner is a super sweet girl. As it’s 30 minutes before closing there aren’t many things left. She welcomed me and recommended the tiramisu. Oh boy, it tasted good! As you know, the highest compliment from an Asian person on dessert is “not so sweet.” Same here: it’s not that sweet, but it has everything it needs to fill my dessert cravings, and you can tell that they used top-grade ingredients.

I talked a bit with the owner Keru（可茹）. Turns out she was a pastry chef who designed one of the most famous cakes at GAGA. I’m sure you’ve tried her work if you’ve ever been to GAGA (which most expats probably do). She always had her dream of opening her own dessert shop, and the rent in Zhujiang New Town is way too high for her, so she decided to settle here in Wuyang New Town, which is not that far away.

Wuyang New Town is a very interesting neighborhood. If you are somewhat experienced as an expat and wanna explore the more local side of Guangzhou, I highly recommend you come over. This area was mainly developed between the mid-90s and early 2000s, when a lot of the buildings were mimicking HongKong–style residential buildings. For the past few years, this has become one of the “hidden gem” spots for locals because a lot of boutique shops have opened here. I rode around and spotted at least 20–30 craft beer, bread, dessert, cocktail, coffee… places. I have a LOT to explore.

Attaching some of the photos I took inside this lovely dessert shop. My phone is a bit outdated so pardon the quality, especially considering it was late at night. The owner did say they recommend you come during the day, especially in the afternoon, when the beautiful sunshine will be dropping inside the shop, creating this beautiful shadow while you enjoy the top-notch desserts.

Most of these places are easy to reach and don’t feel like a touristy. Here is the list that I breakdown,

1. Blueberry’s Grill: About 1.3 miles from the Opry. Takes maybe 3 minutes by car or around 20 minutes walking. Good spot for brunch, food’s always fresh and the people working there are nice. They’ve got good parking too, even that time it’s busy.
2. Lulu’s Cafe: About 6 miles away, roughly a 20-minute drive. Classic beach diner, small place with good coffee and nice people working there.
3. Johnny D’s Waffles: Around 5 miles from the Opry. They’re known for waffles (red velvet the favorite). It’s usually busy, but service moves fast.
4. Eggs Up Grill: About 4.9 miles. Simple food, clean place, and always quick. Perfect if you just want eggs, bacon, and coffee without a wait.
5. Mammy’s Kitchen: About 6.9 miles out, closer to the main strip. They do a breakfast buffet. Food’s fine, but it’s more about quantity than flavor. Parking can be tight on weekends.

If you want something close and actually worth it, Blueberry’s Grill is the easy choice. It’s the closest, has real food made from scratch, and the staff’s always friendly. The servers there are honestly some of the nicest around, always polite, quick, and make you feel welcome every time you visit.",2,1763735865.0,restaurants,1,1.0,False

Want honest feedback on the idea + whether this is something you’d actually use.

I’ve tried every productivity app / planner / calendar I could find.

The problem for me:
	•	Linear calendars and to-do lists feel abstract
	•	I constantly overbook myself because I can’t see my day
	•	Time-blocking works… until it doesn’t, because it’s annoying to maintain

So I started building a little side project called Timely – basically a:

“Revolutionary Circular Time-Blocking Planner That Turns Your Day Into a Visual Clock.”

Core idea:
	I’m building a visual time-blocking app where your day lives on a circular layout instead of a traditional list or grid. The goal is to make it insanely easy to see how your time is allocated, stay aware of how “full” your day is at a glance, and get small hits of progress as you move through your blocks—without any heavyweight project-management clutter.

Genuinely want to validate whether this type of visual time-blocking / circular planner is something people want, or if I’m just weirdly obsessed with clocks. 

If you have a sec, I’d love honest answers to any of these:
	1.	Would you ever use a circular “visual clock” planner instead of a normal calendar app? Why / why not?
	2.	What’s the most annoying thing about your current planner or time-blocking setup?
	3.	If this existed and actually worked well, would you expect it to be:
	•	One-time purchase
	•	Low monthly sub (like the price of a coffee)
	4.	What’s the one feature it would absolutely need for you to switch?

Might set up a waitlist but right now I’m trying to figure out if this solves a real problem for people before I go too deep.

If this sounds like something you’d want to try, tell me what you’d need from it (or just say “I’d join a waitlist for this” so I know I’m not crazy 😅).

Happy to share more details in the comments if that’s allowed in the sub.

I try to support her, but it’s overwhelming. Last week, I finally snapped. She called me sobbing because the grocery store was out of her favorite coffee creamer. I gently told her I couldn’t take calls like that anymore, especially not during work, and that she needed to find healthier ways to process her emotions.

For such an ambitious dream, the country is needing of more liberal incentives to boost private endeavours into entrepreneurship and business.

The Turkish economy has already put a foot in for the liberalisation with the founding of the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey(IDBT). However, to truly attract private investment, whether domestic or international, demands a much greater effort. Hence the Ministry of Finance, as well as the Ministry of Industry, has proposed a plan for such efforts, and agreed to by Celâl Bayar, the man which is mainly in charge for spearheading Turkish economic liberalisation reforms.

The IDBT is no doubt, a large player in this proposal, hence, the shareholders of the bank has agreed to opening up a larger commercial branch of services of the bank, which is the same as the industrial services offered, but to private commercial enterprises, both domestic and international. From now on, the bank will play as Turkey’s top investment partner for private endeavours, both for industry and commerce.

However, the shareholders still recognise the vitality of private capital to the founding of private industry. Therefore the Turkish government would supply $13,000,000 worth of capital over 5 months to the IDBT to help fund more expansive projects. The Turkish government will also be supplying $120,000 to the industrial side of the IDBT every year by loans until it is legally overturned by the larger shareholders or terminated by the IDBT itself. Such measures ensures the expansion of the bank to handle more capacity for larger private industries to boost our industrial sector through private means and reduce state inteference in the economy.

As for commercial endeavours, commerce for the economy is just as important as industry. Hence, the Turkish government will supply $3,870,000 worth of capital over 4 months to start up the commercial side if things for the bank, and if results show an increase in private commerce, the government is ready to provide $12,000,000 for the commercial branch of the bank, provided the initial start-up fund does not run dry after 8 months. The Turkish government will also be supplying $100,000 to the commercial side of the IDBT every year by loans, which can be similarly be ceased by ways mentioned above.

**GENERAL REDUCTION OF TAXATION FOR PRIVATE BUSINESSES**

As aforementioned before, the Turkish government has received an almost eye-watering aid from our American friends. Such aid calls for a reduction from taxation from private businesses to liberalise the economy. Although any corporate tax reduction leads to hurting Turkey’s budget, it will be offset by American aid for a long time. Hence, corporate tax cuts will be as such;

| Business type                                  | Old Tax(%)              | New Tax(%) |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------:|
| Non-Financial Sector Enterprises                      | 25% | 23.75%              |
| Financial Sector Enterprises except Banks | 30% | 29.25%              |
| Banks                              | 30% | 28.2%              |

Non-Financial Sector businesses will receive a very generous 5% tax cut, financial sector enterprises excluding banks get a 2.5% tax cut, and banks get the highest cut of all, at 6%. Such tax cuts is sure to boost private incentives for entrepreneurship in Turkey, especially in urban areas. This would be a step in the direction of a liberalised economy, as the reduction of taxation means a more open market economy with less restrictions theoretically.

**PRIVATISATION OF STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES**

Privatisation of state-owned enterprises is what many economists take into account when measuring economic liberalism. DP officials took into note that the statist policies for the economy during the RPP times led to a great mass of state owned enterprises which could fare better if it were privatised. The list includes many state-owned factories and mines throughout Turkey. However, the most notable privatisations are listed below. Some state-owned corporations will be fully privatised while some will be partially privatised.;

**Sümerbank**

Sümerbank was established in 1933 to manage Turkey’s state textile industry. Sümerbank is not a bank in the contemporary sense, rather a state-owned conglomeration of industrial facilities. Sümerbank’s industries are mainly cotton weaving, carpets, as well as leather and shoes. The conglomeration has 29,227 workers, 41 factories and 468 stores throughout Turkey.

**Etibank**

Etibank was established in 1935 to finance and manage Turkey’s state-owned natural resource extraction, However, the bank also now finances some Turkish energy operations, and has dabbled into commercial banking. The bank could be considered as a state-owned conglomeration, employing around 38,000 miners through the ownership of six mining companies.

**Halkbank**

Halkbank was established in 1933 as a state-owned bank, but started offering services in 1938 as a credit union providing for tradesmen and artisans to promote economic growth. However, the bank now privides services to ordinary folk as well in 1950.

**Tekel A.Ş.**

Tekel A.Ş. was established in 1925, however has its foundations as 2 former French tobacco companies founded in 1862 to exploit on Turkish tobacco. The company in republican times has expanded its fields to alcohol, salt, explosives, gunpowder, matches and tea and coffee.

The privatisation of Tekel A.Ş. will be in phases by its different products. Alcohol and matches will be first privatised.

1p3038h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1p3038h/update_appropriate_time_after_an_intern_leaves_to/,UPDATE - Appropriate time after an intern leaves to ask them out?,"Hi guys! Popping in with an update on my post from the other day asking about when it seemed cool to ask out an intern from work. Thanks for all your helpful thoughts. And then those guys who read *way* too much into this and were convinced that this was some sort of sexual extortion plot to get a good work reference...guys, I hope your cynicism doesn't blind you from noticing when a guy is throwing obvious green lights your way. I decided to stop overthinking (a million people meet their partners at work), be friendlier and more chatty with the intern (let's call him Matt), and then give him my number on his last day if things went well.   

Then, yesterday afternoon we had an early Thanksgiving potluck at work. While everyone else was getting hammered, me, Matt and my work wife L were chatting. We got on the subject of why we weren't drinking. Matt mentioned he's a health nut, L is pregnant, and I said how I used to drink a lot with an ex-boyfriend, and I don't like what alcohol does to me. At the mention of ""ex-boyfriend"" BAM, he lit up and got a little flustered and shy for a second. It was really sweet. And then he found a couple excuses to keep touching me (like, hand on the shoulder, ""hey, I'm getting another soda, want one?""). L picked up on this and kept trying not to laugh.

L finally suggested we go to the coffee shop around the corner for a snack away from our drunk coworkers. But when we got there she suddenly decided she should get home to her husband and left me and Matt alone. We ended up getting some coffee and chatting for a while. Just really fun and laid-back, sparks flying. He even brought up looking for me on Grindr. I told him I don't use it much (I skipped the convo about how I just find Grindr dehumanizing and location-based apps fucking creepy in general). 

We talked about hanging out soon. He asked about this weekend but I have a few volleyball events (that I could technically not go to, but my instinct here is to not rush into things). He's leaving on Monday to travel for the week of thanksgiving, so we landed on a hike or something when he gets back. We swapped numbers and had a really quick hug and peck on the lips out on the sidewalk before we parted ways. 

Today I'm WFH. We exchanged a couple of ""really fun hanging out with you!"" texts, but I'm not the type of person to have all-day convos on text. Like I said, we're going to not rush into things. Realistically with time off for the holidays and when he leaves for the semester, we're only working together maybe nother two weeks. He graduates in a year, and I was thinking like ""I should tell our boss if Matt decides to interview here"" or whatever. But that's very much putting the cart before the horse, and who knows what'll happen then. Right now it's just fun to explore a connection and see where it goes.

Normally I sleep hugging the power plushie, but since I had to clean her (because some coffee spilled) and she was still slightly damp,  I decided to just put her on the stand and have her watch over me. Oh what a horrible decision that was. I turned off the nightlight and slept normally, hugging the extra pillow instead and had a pretty normal weird dream that you can't remember but still know it was a fun little experience. Then a giant eye appeared in the sky/ceiling and I looked around and realized it was suddenly all dark, can't see anything further than arms length other than the glowing eye which doesn't blink and when it did I woke up sweating 2ish hours after I went to bed, which was weird because my fan was on and it was relatively cold outside (I like sleeping in the cold don't judge) Looked back to my nighstand to turn the light on and where power is and she was just sitting there watching me with her red crosshair eyes and a huge-ass grin with some moonlight going around the curtains slightly on her in the dark. Until I turned the light on which didn't make her as scary.

I hate to think this through, but I am really having a hard time right now understanding her. 

She is a full time housewife - at a very young age. Hindi ko maikakaila that she did everything for us when we were kids. Why is she spoiled? Spoiled kasi she never experienced earning money, and she is getting all our financial needs to my Dad and Lolas. 



Now that we are all working, is it really our responsibility to replace my Dad and Lolas Financially? We are all contributing to our home and it is quite an amount, I would say, but I think it will never be enough for her. Hindi naman kami sa nagdadamot, pero bakit hindi kayang magtipid? Hindi kayang bawasan ng onti? Why are we masasamang Kids just because it was not enough? 



Last 2-3 months ago nga I was heartbroken by her din. I am almost 30 years old and I do have a long time boyfriend. To be honest we were both caught up with our families kaya somehow hindi kami maka-move forward. Para sa akin and sa BF ko it is not in our plans to have Kids yet at this time, kasi feeling namin we wanted to enjoy life muna and spoil ourselves. But then out of nowhere my mom told me like “ alam mo wag na kayo mag anak”. I cried that night with my bf hahaha kasi it was always been in my head to become a mom - just not now. Pero I am always looking up to her and saying na pag ako nag kaanak I will do the same as to what she did to us. Tapos nung narinig ko yon sa kanya naalala ko ung quote sa HIMYM, yung nalaman ni Robin na hindi talaga sya pwede magka baby. “It’s one thing not to want something; it's another to be told you can't have it.” 



Bakit nung panahon nila, their parents supported them sa kasal nila, pag baby and all. Bakit sa generation namin, I am told to not have a baby kasi magastos - hindi ko daw kakayanin, plus kailangan pa namin sila intindihin? Bakit noon their parents supported them, bakit kami we needed to support them 100% to the point na kailangan na namin tipirin sarili namin? Are they spoiled? 



I honestly hate thinking this way, I hate hating my parents - kasi hindi dapat. We are thought to respect them, pero bakit habang tumatanda tayo we are slowly being an adult just like them and it seems like ngayon lang natin nakikita how imperfect they are. I chose to stay here with them - kasi alam ko in the future iiwan nila kami, I wanted to spend time with them, grow old with them. Pero bakit ung pagstay sa side nila requires sacrifices? to the point na hindi namin pwede ienjoy ang sarili naming pera - because they needed it din, yung may bibilin kami pero need pa namin ipaalam sa kanya na “hindi ma, mura lang to”. Bakit kami pa din yung masama? Are we really that bad?



I wanted to be more, I wanted to do things for myself, gusto kong mag birthday manlang when I turned 30, pero bawal - hindi sila masaya about it. I wanted to study ulit, mag ipon, mag coffee with friends. pero Kapag gumagala kami, sinasama naman siya pero mostly ayaw nya kasi nga mas gusto nalang nya na pera nalang. Nasanay ba sya na laging may hawak ng pera that it triggers her pag wala? 



And when she needs money, shes asking for it in a demanded way (like it was truly our responsibility to give) Why is it pag nagtanong ka, sisigawan ka agad? Ang Frustrating. Bilang babeng anak hindi ko alam kung ang pinaka tamang decision nalang is to move out? Kasi pakiramdam ko mas lalala ang situation namin If I stayed a bit longer? 



Ayokong isipin lahat ng mga sinabi ko dito, hindi ba pwedeng maging tulad nalang kami ng dati? Kaso wala ehh we were in a situation na kinausap nya pa kaming magkakapatid that what we are giving is not enough. That we are no use, na wala kaming kwentang anak, that we do not care for her. It breaks my heart to hear that, kasi out of everyone from us na magkakapatid ako lagi nag eeffort to make her birthday more special, every mother’s day. MInsan kinakausap ko pa ung isang kapatid ko para di sila mag away. Pero iba talaga ang tampo nya if you didn’t give her the amount of money that she asks. But still we were called as walang kwenta.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

So I grew up in the Middle East , where I spend my childhood having outdoor BBQs, perfecting my shakshuka recipe & being the nerd in school haha 

Ever since then , it’s been a soul searching journey to find out who I am first and what do I truly like. ( I love slow walks discovering new places, having tea at 5pm, going to bookstores to collect their old books, visiting museums & art shows ( even though I am horrible at art myself lol ), binge watching cooking videos and playing tennis, among others )

I wanted to love my work and life before being with someone, soooo  I didn’t have any relationships so far , but hey, good news is that I don’t have any ex-baggage lol

I am pretty adaptable and open to trying out new things constantly ( running marathons, learning pottery, coffee making courses, watching European movies ) so would love to meet someone who is also kind, sweet and kinda introverted like me lol 

I am a quiet tea shop in the mountains kind of guy, mixed with excited puppy energy, who would love to be with someone who I can go on chaotic adventures with!

Coffee first date, went really well. Went to dinner, long walk after, third date at her house. She asked me to go away with her for three days. We had only kissed a few times at this point. Drive 6 hours away to a small resort. Her plan was to drive in her adventure van, she would bring her dog and stay in van with dog unless we felt good and she would stay in my room. I told her I would think about it. We did another date and I am really vibing well with her.

We go on trip together, she has a pet sitter so no dog. I will say I am really comfortable and excited to be with this woman. We really get along and I am totally open with her which is unusual.

She wants to sleep in bed with me. I got a room with two beds. In the morning she initiates sex, it was fantastic. We hang out all day, go to hot springs, dinner, talking all day. Back at the room we watch a show and spoon all night. Have sex again in the morning. Get cleaned up and pack up to drive home. This was our fourth date in ten days. We barely left each others side for three whole days and had very deep conversations.

In our conversations we are talking about trips next year, big life choices and all kinds of things in between. Next date she wants to spend the day together and have fun, plus a little help around her house. Sounds great, I ask what do you want to do for fun? She wants to walk the dog. Ok. She asks me what I want- I say I would like to walk the dog and then you put on that outfit you wore day two of our getaway and lets go to your room. She was completely turned off by this and says you cannot expect to have sex with me or tell me what to wear. She says that was meaningless hotel sex. I am totally confused and thought we had a great connection, thought we were building a relationship. Is this normal? Am I expecting too much? ",0,1763734748.0,dating_advice,10,0.17,False

1p2zsz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1p2zsz8/bff_app_experience_as_a_woman/,BFF app experience as a woman,"I’ve been using the BFF app for a while and wanted to share my experience and see if anyone felt the same. I’m a 36 yo straight woman for reference.

1. Most people on there are flakes. You chat for a little, set up a coffee, then they ghost you. Some reply weeks or months later

2. Many openly gay women who are clearly not looking for friendship but something else

3. Went for a coffee with this one girl, she was being super weird and intense, asking about expectations and stuff. Like girl, chill, I’m just looking for someone to do fun activities with, not a relationship. I ask her if she wants to hang out in a couple of weeks and she says no, let’s hang out in a month. I’m like ok but I’m looking for friends who are more available. She ghosts me for months, MONTHS then reaches out again. I say good luck with everything but I don’t think we can be friends. She gets upset and is all like why and bla bla. Well, you’re clearly not available to hang out or text so wth! Weird af

4. The worst one: I become friends with this one girl, we hang out every week, we’re both foodies so that’s the main activity we share etc. Fast forward 6 months, I break up with my boyfriend and she’s there to support me but she starts becoming more and more intense saying things that sound like love declarations. But she’s dating men and has only ever dated men so even though I’m weirded out by her intensity, I dismiss it as immaturity. 3 months later she tells me she’s in love with me and blames me because I was uncomfortable with her and says I should have said something (I did, I had told her to stop acting like we’re a couple)

In conclusion, BFF seems to be full of openly gay or closeted folks. I’m just so confused. I’m gonna turn to Meetup for group social activities instead because at this point I’ve gotten super uncomfortable with 1:1 friendships.",10,1763734736.0,Bumble,11,0.86,False
