#MODIFIERS

[[TD2] News - Year 6 Season 3: Burden of Truth - 1.Y6S3 Modifiers](//staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/3zA868SWO3pAN8Fo3NZs4W/accdd4cd3df08f55fadb8ec1537bd16a/1.Y6S3_Modifiers.jpg)

##Global Modifier

**Rogue Momentum** is all about skill, bending the rules, and using dirty tactics to dominate in high-risk, high-reward combat. The more enemies you eliminate, the more Momentum you build---but keeping it is just as crucial as gaining it.

Momentum builds up through combat actions, with different kills granting different amounts. Standard enemies give a small boost, while headshots, skill-based eliminations, multi-kills, and explosive takedowns provide even bigger gains.

Elite targets offer even greater Momentum, making them high-priority threats. As you take down enemies, your **Momentum Meter** fills, pushing you through different Tiers---each unlocking powerful combat bonuses.

### Momentum Tiers & Bonuses

Higher tiers mean faster movement, better reload speed, increased weapon and skill damage, and even faster rate of fire. At the top tier, you gain Skill Overcharge, letting you use abilities more often.

Tier 1  
""Calculated""

Tier 2  
""Swift""

Tier 3  
""Ruthless""

Tier 4  
""Savage""

  
""Unstoppable""

Skill Overcharge

Yes

However, Momentum doesn't stack. You only benefit from the tier you're currently at, and if you lose Momentum, you drop to a lower tier. 

### Momentum Decay

Momentum slowly fades over time, both in and out of combat. Taking damage also slows down how quickly you can earn more Momentum.

To slow down decay, stay active! Sprinting for at least 2 seconds slows the decay rate, and using Pulse stops it entirely for 5 seconds.

### Blacklisted Enemies

Keep an eye out for Blacklisted enemies — randomly marked foes with a slashed icon. Taking them down gives a huge Momentum boost:

*   Standard Blacklisted Enemy → +7% Momentum
*   Elite Blacklisted Enemy → +10% Momentum

As a bonus, eliminating a Blacklisted enemy grant Energized, a 15-second buff that increases weapon handling and critical hit chance by 10%.

But be careful — if you don't take them out quickly, they can drain your Momentum fast, so make them your top priority and eliminate them as soon as possible.


##Active Modifiers

The active modifiers enhance the aggressive playstyle and high-stakes theme, where performing well grants powerful bonuses, while failure might even lead to reductions in Armor and health.

*   **Overdrive**: Instantly maxes out Momentum to 100%, granting powerful combat bonuses for a limited time. After wearing off, Momentum is gained at a rate of -70% for 150 seconds.
*   **Vendetta**: Activating Vendetta marks several enemies. Killing these enemies using primary, secondary, skill, or pistol grants stacking tank bonuses. Failure to eliminate them imposes armor and health reduction penalties.
*   **Tactical Supremacy**: Doubles the effects of all equipped Passive Modifiers for a limited time. While active, Momentum gain from Passive Modifiers is frozen, but it also prevents Blacklisted enemies from draining your Momentum.

##Passive Modifiers

Players can choose from **12 Passive Modifiers**, divided into skill-specific and general modifiers. Up to 3 can be equipped at any time.

*   **Explosive Amp:** Seeker Mine deals 100% more damage against Blacklisted enemies.
*   **Critical Recovery:** Performing a critical hit restores 5% of your maximum armor.
*   **Critical Momentum:** Critical hits have a 50% chance to grant 1% Momentum.
*   **Momentum Surge:** Kills with skills double Momentum gain.
*   **Explosive Expertise:** Explosive skill kills reduce the cooldown of that skill by 30% if you score a multi-kill.
*   **Reaper Scan:** Enemies scanned with the Pulse have a 25% chance to receive a Blacklist Mark.
*   **Aggressive Drone:** Increases the Striker Drone's damage by 50%, but reduces its duration by 40%.
*   **Fortified Shield:** Strengthen any equipped Shield base health by 100%, allowing you to stay on the front lines longer.
*   **Reactive Reinforcement:** Heals 5% of your maximum armor when your Shield takes damage (cooldown: 10 seconds).
*   **Overclocked Projector:** The Decoy emits a bright flash when destroyed or deactivated, Blinding up to 2 enemies targeting it. Receive 5% bonus Momentum for every affected hostile.
*   **Microwave Coils:** Up to 4 enemies affected by Pulse have a 50% chance to receive a Burn status effect. Receive 5% bonus Momentum for every affected hostile.
*   **Rigged Battery:** Drones that are destroyed or dismantled applies Shock to 2 nearby enemies. Receive 5% bonus Momentum for every affected hostile.

##Hostile Countermeasures

Enemies push back against Momentum with **Frenzy**:

*   **Enemy Frenzy**: enemies gain rate of fire, movement speed, and armor/health regen.
*   **Enemy Frenzy Scaling**: the number of enemies and the amount of Rage applied scales as players progress though the Season Chapters.

We have 20 mugs but this one just feels the best to me and it's a bit sentimental. He used it this morning and I asked him again to please use one of the other mugs. He got defensive and flat out said no, he'll use the cup if he wants and I'm weird for having a favorite and we should share everything bc we're married. He said I should put it in a different place if I don't want him to use it. I said, that's fine but then you'll have to remember to put it there when you unload the dishwasher. He didn't agree to doing that. 

I just had a simple request to let me have a cup that is mine bc I like it the best. That's really not that weird is it? He said he'd never do that to me and I told him I wouldn't care if he did. 

He even called me on his way to work to talk more and really double down on how weird I am and that I shouldn't ask this of him. He even suggested we GO TO MARRIAGE COUNSELING OVER THIS. (We've gone in the past but have been doing well lately)

It's all been a bit of a personal learning curve so I'm curious, what do you think makes a venue child-friendly? What do you look for and and how do you know where to take your little ones?

My wife and I took our 3-month old little girl out the other day for some fresh air and a nice day out. As often is the case with a baby, we soon needed to grab a coffee somewhere to change our little one so we popped in some place and asked if they had a changing table, with intention of grabbing a drink there too. 

I won't name the venue but honestly by their reaction you'd have thought we asked them to change the dirty nappy for us! 😂 I said we'd have bought something but wanted to check they had the changing facilities first otherwise it would have been pointless buying a drink there as we wouldn’t be able to finish it. They didn’t have one so we decided to leave.

We went literally right next door to another venue with the same ask and the difference in reaction was stark - they couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating, guiding us to the bathroom, putting the table and fresh papers down for us, getting new bin bags, the lot. It's still narking me now how different the experience was, from being treated like a hindrance, to being totally accommodated and appreciated. They were so nice we ended up grabbing dinner there too as well as drinks - their understanding really made that much of a difference.

I'm sure everyone with a little one has found that going out can be stressful and anxiety inducing with constantly having to think 5 steps ahead; is there room for a pram? Can I even fit the pram through the doors? Are there stairs to tackle? Where's the nearest exit route in case they have a full on tantrum? 🤣 I’ve found it so anxiety inducing - something neither my wife or I expected when becoming new parents!

So it's got me wondering, what do other parents do in this instance? What do you typically look for and how do you find good places to take your family? We’ve got friends who are new parents too and they typically go to the same places, but my wife and I like trying new places as we think being out and about is good for our daughter. 

Any tips or advice would be much appreciated! ",3,1740419795.0,UKParenting,11,1.0,False
1ix8878,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1ix8878/micro_roasting_business/,Micro roasting business,"Background: I am based in eastern europe (Hungary) and half time working for a small coffee roastery as a roaster. We work on a fluid bed machine and selling about 400-600 kg a month.

I am wondering how I could start my own business. My idea is since I have a near empty basement with an unused chimney, I could set up an aillio bullet relatively easily. My plan would be to roast and sell locally about 80 - 100 kg per month as a side job.



**Cost calculation example:**

Green coffee expense with vat: 7€/kg - 700€/month

Property: free

Webshop monthly fee: 40€

Packaging: 1€/kg - 100€/month

Monthly fees and permission cost: 100€/month

Marketing: self made, so around 10€/month for ads.

Starter investment refund: 100€/month

***Total monthly investment:*** around 1100€/month

***Monthly income:*** for this particular coffee I would be looking at 2000€/100kg with tax deducted.

  
My question would be: is this at least near real calculation or did I miss something major? 

My plan is to start my business like this and later on I would like to expand it with a bigger roaster. I think it would be a good way to start, learn the marketing business and start making a brand now then expand later. 

Of course I would make a much more detailed business plan before I start, I just want to get the hang of it if it is even possible.

I matched with a girl I think is very pretty and interesting and I honestly would love to go on a date. However we exchange messages like once every 3 days. I usually respond in a few hours when I see the message. I totally understand that people are busy and may only respond when they check the app. Given that she is still responding I'm assuming there is some level of interest there.

From her profile she seems really interesting but seeing as we've only sent each other like 3 messages each (haven't really gotten to know each other past a discussion about one of her prompts) I'm wondering how to go about at least dropping my number. Should I just say ""Hey you seem really cool, we should text if you're comfortable, no pressure if you still want to chat on the app"" and drop my number (then if she never texts it's whatever).

It just feels a bit early in the convo to straight up ask her out for coffee or drinks but I also don't know if there's different expectations on here.

Our volunteers do all kinds of amazing work, and Green Crab Monitoring is one of the projects I’m most excited about.

You'll learn about how big of a threat these crabs are, what’s being done to stop them, and—if you're interested—how you can get involved. Zero pressure, just good info. Honestly, the more people who know about European Green Crabs, the better.

I’d love a quick RSVP (email me at [**leshell@dungenessrivercenter.org**](mailto:leshell@dungenessrivercenter.org)) so I know how many chairs to set up and how much coffee to brew. But if you decide last minute to swing by, that's cool too.

I am 21 he is 25. Tonight I went through his phone for the first time in a while and saw these texts between him and his coworker. My heart immediately sunk to my stomach. We’ve been having really bad fights lately and I have tried breaking up so many times but fail to go through with it due to my depression and loneliness. He doesn’t want to break up and begs me everyday to let him fix things and prove to me he can be what I need. He also deleted all his messages with her before Thursday, the morning after one of our big fights. After seeing these texts he is trying to convince me that they are not flirting whatsoever and that this is not what the beginning of a talking stage looks like.

For background, we have our fights about a couple of things - Last year he had downloaded a dating app to flirt with women behind my back and when I found out I was devastated. He promised he would change and nothing like this would ever happen again. Since then he has texted a handful of girls (coworkers, classmates) in ways that I am not comfortable with because it is always clear to me that he is subtly flirting with them. I pick fights over my jealousy, the fact that he cannot provide financially whatsoever, cannot clean up after himself in our tiny apartment, is chronically late, and nothing ever changes despite him telling me everyday that he loves me and wants to fix things. I feel so heartbroken and let down by our relationship but in the back of my mind I just want him here. I have nobody else. ",12,1740419460.0,AmIOverreacting,29,1.0,False

# 🌊 Chennai: Where the Sun Never Sets... and Neither Does Your Sweat ☀️

1. Chennai isn’t just hot. It’s so hot even **Minecraft lava takes notes**. You dig three blocks down in survival mode and hit **pure Chennai weather**. No Nether portal needed.
2. Rain in Chennai is like **an Ender Dragon fight**. Rare, chaotic, and **destroys everything you’ve built in seconds**. One drizzle and suddenly, your entire street becomes **Waterworld 2.0**—except Kevin Costner isn’t coming to save you.
3. Bangalore has unpredictable weather. Chennai has no weather. It’s just **permanent oven mode**. Chennai people look at ""seasons"" the way **Bangalore looks at roads without potholes**—**pure myth**.

# 🚗 Auto Rickshaws: The Real Boss Mobs of Chennai

1. Chennai autos don’t have meters because **the price is based on the driver’s mood, the planetary alignment, and whether you look like a tourist**. Bargaining with them is like trading with a **Minecraft villager**, except instead of emeralds, you lose your dignity.
2. Auto drivers in Chennai **don’t drive**—they **speedrun GTA 5**. One moment, you’re in Alwarpet, next thing you know, you’re respawning in Tambaram.

# 🍛 Culture So Rich, Yet Your Wallet Stays Poor

1. Chennai is a city where people will **judge your Tamil more than your morals**. You could commit tax fraud, but if you pronounce ‘Sambar’ wrong, **you are DONE**.
2. ""Our food is world-famous!"" Bro, why is every single dish just **rice with a different emotional backstory**? Sambar rice, curd rice, rasam rice—**how many ways can you emotionally manipulate me with carbs?**
3. The only thing spicier than the **chutney at Saravana Bhavan** is the judgment from that one **Mylapore mami** when you say you don’t like Rajinikanth movies. **Better pack your bags, you’re exiled now.**

# 🏖️ Marina Beach: The Biggest Scam of the Century

1. ""Marina Beach is the longest urban beach in India!"" **Yeah, and also the longest walk to touch water.** You start walking at sunrise, and by the time you reach the sea, **it’s sunset**.
2. Ever tried swimming at Marina Beach? **Congratulations, you now have a PhD in Microplastic Consumption**. Free **bonus tetanus shots** included.

# 🎭 Bangalore vs Chennai: The Ultimate Feud

1. Bangalore has **co-working spaces**. Chennai has **power cuts**. Work-from-home? **Try work-from-inverter.**
2. ""Bangalore traffic is bad!"" Bro, in Chennai, **you see a road sign and that’s the last time you see it clearly.** Because the next second, **it’s covered in political posters, movie ads, and lost dog notices.**
3. Chennai is so humid, even **Bangalore techies start sweating when they visit**. Your **iPhone will get water damage** just from the **moisture in the air**.

# 🏏 Bonus: CSK vs Everything Else

1. Chennai people say they don’t believe in violence, yet **put them in an IPL argument, and suddenly, it’s WWE Royal Rumble.**
2. **Dhoni is their god.** Criticize CSK in Chennai, and you’ll be **hunted down faster than a dropped dosa on the floor.**

# 💀 Final Thoughts

1. Chennai isn’t just a city. It’s **a survival game set to Hardcore Mode.** You either **adapt or evaporate.**
2. Chennai summers are so hot, **even the Sun files a complaint.** NASA once took temperature readings here and thought **they landed on Mercury.**
3. The only real AC in Chennai is **standing near the freezer in a Saravana Stores**.

**Chennai: Come for the culture, stay because the sweat has glued you to the chair.** 🔥🔥🔥

Grew up without friends, mom is an angel that taught me to live life with a smile on my face, dad is a self-made businessman (and acts like one). I work with him. Never been a good student. Never been the soul of the party. But I've learned so much and took risks. I've been a great friend and I am loved. Not good at relationships. Independence is a priority.

I grew up with metalheads. Went to jazz cafes. Learned to do a radio show. Went raving. Did drugs. Stopped doing drugs. Did art. Explored all types of art. Became a designer. Learned how to build things - websites, platforms, apps. Worked as a carpenter, salesman, ceramicist, graphic producer, marketer. Volunteered for years on end in migration related activities and organizations. Developed too many interests to list.

Right now, I'm sitting after the end of the workday in my dad's factory. Just finished up producing 35 sets of samples of a product we sell. Replying to some e-mail. After this, I'm going home to design some packaging solutions for an artisanal chocolate manufacturer and then I'm having a meeting with a friend with whom I'm creating a design agency. Then I'll have a cup of coffee with a friend after dinner. 

But tomorrow nothing will be much different.

I have a growing will in my heart that tells me that I should read poetry. That I should go to Iran and study architecture. That I should meet farmers from Morocco and businessmen from the Netherlands. That I should sell everything I have to buy Merino wool, just so I don't smell bad throughout the days when I'm homeless. That I should organize a festival in someplace I've never been. That I should learn the languages that no one can talk. That I should visit oil refineries, syntethic greenhouses, cellars of giant barrels of wine.

Compared to this, my life feels like nothing - just daily living. Eating, being aware and trying to be a good person if I can be one. Maybe once a year I'll get interested in someone. There's just so much out there that I want to explore.

But a fear that to do this I'll need to leave everyone behind feels so close to home. I feel like I'll be leaving my father behind when he created something for me to succeed. I feel like my mother will miss me and resent me for not having our daily conversation while cooking. I feel like my sisters won't have anyone to talk about the problems they're having. I feel like my friends will move on, as they should, and that our friendship won't be the same if I take a leap of faith in myself. I fear that once I return, I won't want to stay home.

I want to take my savings and go away. Not to run away. But to experience something that's not ""here"". And I don't know how to do it.

If something runs through your mind after reading this, share it. Would love to get an opinion from someone who's finding this relatable and took the leap of faith.

Moving in New York City can be a challenging experience, and hiring professional movers helps make the process smoother and more efficient. While moving companies charge for their services, tipping is a customary way to show appreciation for the hard work movers put in to ensure a successful relocation. Understanding how much to tip movers in NYC can be confusing, as several factors influence the amount. This guide provides insights into standard tipping practices, factors to consider, and best practices for rewarding movers fairly.

# How Much Should You Tip Movers in NYC?

The general rule of thumb for tipping movers in NYC is to tip each mover between $4 to $5 per hour per person. For a half-day move (4 hours), a tip of $15 to $25 per mover is appropriate, while a full-day move (8 hours or more) warrants a tip of $30 to $50 per mover. If the move involves extensive labor, such as carrying heavy furniture up multiple flights of stairs or handling fragile items with extra care, consider tipping on the higher end of the scale. Some customers prefer to tip as a percentage of the total moving cost, typically around 10-20% divided among the movers. **For more:** [**how much to tip movers NYC**](https://www.allaroundmoving.com/moving-tips-how-much-to-tip-movers-in-nyc/)

# Factors That Affect How Much to Tip Movers

Several factors influence how much you should tip your movers in NYC. The complexity of the move plays a major role—if movers handle large, bulky furniture, navigate narrow hallways, or manage a long-distance move, they deserve a more generous tip. The quality of service is another key consideration; movers who are punctual, professional, and efficient should be rewarded accordingly. Additionally, the weather conditions on the day of the move can be a factor—working in extreme heat, cold, or rain may warrant a higher tip as a token of appreciation for their effort.

# Best Practices for Tipping Movers

When tipping movers, it’s best to do so in cash, as it ensures they receive the gratuity directly. Handing the tip individually to each mover is a great way to personally acknowledge their hard work. If you prefer, you can also give the tip to the team leader and request that it be distributed equally. In some cases, moving companies may allow tipping via credit card or check, so it’s worth checking in advance. Offering refreshments, such as water, coffee, or snacks, is also a thoughtful way to show gratitude to the movers during the job.

# Conclusion

Tipping movers in NYC is an important way to show appreciation for their hard work and dedication. While there is no fixed rule, the standard tipping range is $4 to $5 per hour per mover or 10-20% of the total moving cost. Factors such as service quality, move complexity, and weather conditions should be taken into account when determining the tip amount. By tipping fairly and following best practices, you ensure that the movers feel valued for their efforts, leading to a more positive moving experience for everyone involved.

1ix7qfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/juryduty/comments/1ix7qfh/my_federal_court_jury_duty_experience_southern_ny/,My Federal Court Jury Duty Experience - Southern NY District,"I was just recently part of a potential juror pool for a federal criminal case. It was my first time ever going to a court for jury duty, and compared to what I heard from other potential jurors about their prior experiences, it was quite a bit more intense. So I thought it may be helpful to share my experience and some tips, which for the most part would apply to any federal court process. 



1. Electronic Devices - Be prepared with some form of non-electronic entertainment. The first day, I brought nothing with me and thankfully the court had some magazines and books in the jury assembly room. However, there was no such community literature available in the courtroom itself. This resulted in me sitting for many consecutive hours basically just staring at the wall or out the window. 

a) The court collects all electronic devices upon entry, no exceptions. In my case, it was a tag and locker system. We could collect our electronics during lunch breaks and at the end of the day. The court website was unclear about what could be brought into the court building, or what could be kept on your person, so I wasn't expecting the process they use. You can bring anything you want into the building, but once you get through security, it will be collected. You cannot have any electronics in the jury assembly room, court room, or any other interior spaces. (Not sure if this is federal practice or just for the specific court I went to, so YMMV).

b) Technically, according to the court officer, there are no periodicals allowed (magazines, newspapers, etc.) anything that may contain information about the court's ongoing legal proceedings, because it may affect the impartiality of potential jurors. They didn't get strict about this until we got into voir dire. This includes crossword puzzles, sudoku puzzles, etc. that may be contained within a publication that could contain information about current events.

  
2. Travel - The court will reimburse travel expenses, in addition to the daily base pay for jury duty. This is typically done according to a flat rate depending on how far your home is from the courthouse. In my case, because I lived in a county farther away from the courthouse, there was an additional reimbursement available for tolls and parking. However, all of my receipts needed to be postmarked within 3 days of my last day of service, so they had to be collected and mailed out ASAP. This was a problem with EZpass because the transactions did not get posted to my account until the day after, so I was already a day behind. To be safe, use cash if possible and get a receipt on the spot. 

a) I noted this information in the juror orientation, but they did not emphasize it very well - if you get excused on your first day, you do not receive this reimbursement. At least that's how I understood it. So, don't go parking in any expensive garages on day 1 thinking you'll definitely get that money back, because you might not. 

  
3. Food and drink - The only item allowed in every room was water, and it had to be something with a closing lid (e.g. a plastic water bottle with a pop top or twist top, metal water bottle with a screw on lid, etc.) The jury assembly room had a small break room space with vending machines and coffee machines, but the selection was limited, and this was the only place we could consume anything but water. And our group had some extended periods of time inside the court room, so we couldn't even utilize the break room during this time anyway. Bring water, and take advantage of your non-courtroom time to eat or drink anything you think you might want because you could get called up to the courtroom with little notice and be stuck for hours without a snack or drink. 

a) We had a lunch break each day, but it never came when they said it would. Sometimes as late as 1:45PM. Thankfully they gave us plenty of time, usually more than an hour to go out and get lunch. But after the electronic device pickup process, and re-entry through security on the way back in, it was really only 30 minutes of actual break time. 

  
4. Bathrooms - Use it when you can because during certain proceedings in the courtroom, you will not be allowed to leave and use the restroom. This may be down to the individual judge, court clerk, or court officer, but they were strict about this with our group. 

  
5. Timeline - Every piece of information I saw, both on the website and on paper in the actual courthouse, said to expect a term of about 1-2 weeks, with the chance of being on a case that went longer. Do not take this at face value. This is where I went wrong. 

a) I had already postponed jury service and did not want to get stuck with a ""Must Serve"" summons at an inopportune time, so I figured I would serve this one and be done in a couple of weeks. The issue I had is that I didn't even get called in until the week after the date on my summons, so there was one week gone already. 

b) I had a significant work trip scheduled almost exactly a month after the first day I went into the court, so I thought even with a case of 2-3 weeks, I would be okay. Until meeting with the judge and learning that the case would take about 4-6 weeks (by their estimation). The judge could not care less about the work trip. 

c) By the court's timeline, once the jury had been finalized, they were expecting to begin the trial 2-3 days after the day I was called in. So there was essentially another week gone.

d) In short, what they call 2 weeks in the court information could become as long as 2 months very easily, especially with a high-profile case. If you have ANY CONCERNS WHATSOEVER about missing something that is important to you, best to request a postponement or figure a way to be excused before you ever show up and get forced through meeting the judge and counsel, and voir dire. It's an emotionally draining process. 

  
7. Schedule - At least in my case, things never began when the court said they would. 8:30AM arrival on day 1, and then it was 10:30 before there was any movement. Same thing for day 2. Day 3 into the defense's juror questionnaire was when things finally kept to a stricter timeline. All of this to say, don't be late, but don't kill yourself trying to get there early. If they say 9AM and you're walking in at 8:55AM, you'll be fine. In our case, because there was a chance of the trial starting on the last day of jury selection, there were members of the public arriving and gumming up the security line. Take this into consideration depending on where you are in the jury selection process.

  
6. The Process 

a) On day one (which again was the week after the initial date on my summons) there were 120 total potential jurors called for 8:30AM. The jury clerk provided an orientation to everyone in the jury assembly room at about 9-9:30AM, and then they called the first crop of 60 jurors up to the courtroom to meet the judge and counsel one by one. In the afternoon, the second crop of 60 got called up. Each group of 60 would wait in the courtroom, while potential jurors would go back into the jury deliberation room one by one to meet the judge, defendants, and state's attorneys. After a brief description of the case, each juror would have the opportunity to indicate any potential conflicts. When I say brief, I mean \*BRIEF\*. After a full day of doing nothing but sitting around, and not having anything to occupy myself in the courtroom, I was fried and remember almost nothing that the judge said, or that I said in response. Try your absolute hardest to pay attention, and take notes and ask clarifying questions. Ultimately, you could be in it for the long haul and someone's future could depend on you, so treat it with the gravity it demands. 

b) Day two, any remaining potential jurors (about 70-80) reported directly to the courtroom and their names were placed in a lottery machine (literally). Potential jurors were randomly assigned to 39 juror pool seats. I was not a part of this initial selection. The judge, with all attorneys present, provided a more detailed description of the case, the charges issued against the defendant, all parties involved, etc. The judge named each defendant and their affiliations, each individual attorney and their affiliations, and any other people, businesses, or entities that were concerned in the case (such as potential witnesses). The judge would ask the jury pool a series of questions, including having been the victim or perpetrator of particular crimes, having court or law enforcement involvement, etc. And after each question or series of questions, potential jurors would have the opportunity to indicate a possible conflict of interest or anything that might affect their ability to be fair and impartial in the case. Sometimes this was done in the open with jurors from their seats answering the judge on the bench, sometimes this was done in sidebar, and sometimes it was done in the judge's chambers. In the latter cases, all of the attorneys would gather around to be able to make notes on juror's responses, make challenges, etc. If you ever get into this situation, it can be incredibly uncomfortable. Nobody ever wants to have to talk to a judge and group of lawyers. Just remember that the judge's job is to uphold the law, which means providing a fair and impartial jury. Anything you might have going on in your life that has no bearing on that fact, it isn't the judge's job to care. Don't take it personally. In the end, many potential jurors were excused during this process based on potential conflicts, and I was called to rotate into the pool of 39 potential jurors. 

c) Day three, each juror received a questionnaire and had to stand in the presence of the court room (including the judge, all attorneys, defendants, and all other jurors) and respond to the questions. These were more geared at getting to know the people themselves, such as family construction, living situations, jobs, hobbies, etc. All 39 potential jurors had to provide their responses. At this point there were not many remaining potential jurors aside from the pool of 39, maybe 5-7 at most. And according to the court officer, if the attorneys could not agree on a finalized jury, they would call more new potential jurors from the jury assembly room (a new 50 had reported that morning) to start the process all over again. As with every other step, the questionnaire was a long process, and culminated in the attorneys deliberating to agree on the final jury selection (in our case, 12 plus 4 alternates for a total of 16). I was ultimately not a part of this 16, and so was excused at the end of my third day. 

  
If you are anything like me, having a more detailed account like this will help you know what to expect and hopefully put you at ease a bit. Hope this is helpful, and I will try my best to respond to questions in the comments. ",5,1740418453.0,juryduty,1,1.0,False

We only know now, and whatever we don’t know outside of now, we fear. So, existence is literally us constantly trying to find some semblance of footing in the face of that unbeatable fear; some comfort, some security, some cope, some distraction - some extent of peace in the midst of never ending unease. 

Those of us who are lucky manage to latch onto some semblance of peace and comfort that lasts more than just thriving day to day. When that happens, what occurs? We become bored. We crave experience, creation, variety. That’s why you see a lot of rich powerful people who, despite being made forever, are still out there doing the most in the world. Problem appears to go hand in hand with existence; subconsciously it is almost like we WANT these problems, the same way we want a good show or story to have drama in order for it to be interesting.

If you are rid of all your problems that currently binds you, you can experience an immense feeling of peace. And even joy. Yes, but what next? You will not be happy just drinking good coffee, eating good food, listening to good music, and laying in clean sheets everyday. You will want to Do something. To Create. To Experience. To have Progress. And following up with progress, Achievement. You will want to interact with this world, in a way where you feel that sense of connection. Problem with all these things is it comes with destruction; creation and destruction go hand in hand, it is the inevitable law of our dualistic world. We don’t know why it is, but it is all the same.

If it isn’t clear by now, we are not here to stay. We are to be here temporarily. The only real “legacy” that is true and legitimate and means anything at all, is how consciousness progresses as a whole in this world. How the world changes and evolves as a whole through time, that is the only real legacy there is. So if you read and gather enough about the history so far, and you can believe that we have been, and are still largely rooted in so much ignorance, which causes so much unnecessary pain and suffering - drop your attachments. Drop your expectations. Drop what you believe you NEED to do on this earth. Drop your grievances. Even if it doesn’t stop consequences of ignorances that precede you from playing out, it also is the solution to prevent further suffering and hurt. For everybody. And if somebody earlier in your generation actually learned this, they could have prevented you from suffering - at all. For whatever reason, it had to be you. So do it. Take the blue pill, as they say. You may not be able to ever know all the reasons why, but confront the whys anyway; face it head on, rather than finding another cope, addiction or distraction.

She didn't mention anything like oh I think she does like you or anything like that, so I don't know what I should make of this...

I thought this was more than a reasonable split, even quite generous, but agreed to it. Today he sent the the chats he has lined up, and he has one scheduled mid day for wednesday, chats scheduled from 10a-4p on thursday, one at 12 p on friday and is still waiting to schedule three confirmed but unscheduled chats. We were planning to fly in early wednesday morning and fly out late friday night. 
Looking at the schedule admittedly made me a little frustrated with the situation because to me, this would have been our last trip together in college and all I asked for was 3 days. I do understand that getting a job is EXTREMELY important but I had hoped he would be a little more understanding of why this is important to me. I told him that I unfortunately don’t think that I am willing to spend $500+ on a trip when I don’t think I will be able to spend it well and think that he should go alone. He said okay and said “im sorry”. I don’t know what to do here, I don’t know if I made the right decision. what can I do instead? I cannot fly out any different days because the flight tickets are really expensive .",2,1740417949.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False
1ix7imw,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_kitchen/comments/1ix7imw/why_white_coffee_is_the_new_super_drink_for_your/,Why White Coffee Is the New Super Drink for Your Health,"White coffee is gaining popularity as a new super drink that offers impressive health benefits. Unlike traditional coffee, white coffee is roasted at a lower temperature, which helps preserve more nutrients and natural compounds. This makes it a healthier alternative for coffee lovers who want a smoother, less acidic, and more energizing beverage. In this article, we’ll explore why white coffee is considered a super drink and how it can benefit your health.

# What Is White Coffee?

White coffee is made from the same coffee beans as regular coffee, but the roasting process is different. The beans are roasted at a lower temperature (around 325°F) compared to regular coffee, which is typically roasted at 450°F or higher. This lighter roasting process results in a pale, beige-colored coffee with a nutty and slightly sweet flavor.

# Why Is White Coffee a Super Drink?

White coffee is considered a super drink because it retains more nutrients, antioxidants, and caffeine compared to regular coffee. The lower roasting temperature prevents the loss of essential compounds that provide numerous health benefits.

# Health Benefits of White Coffee

# 1. Higher Antioxidant Content

White coffee contains more antioxidants than regular coffee because the lighter roasting process preserves chlorogenic acid, a powerful antioxidant. Antioxidants help protect your cells from damage caused by free radicals, reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.

# 2. Boosts Energy and Focus

White coffee has a higher caffeine content than traditional coffee, which makes it a great option for those who need an extra energy boost. The increased caffeine level enhances mental alertness, improves concentration, and helps fight fatigue.

# 3. Supports Heart Health

Drinking white coffee in moderation may promote heart health. The antioxidants in white coffee help reduce inflammation, lower bad cholesterol levels, and improve blood circulation. These benefits can help lower the risk of heart disease and stroke.

# 4. Aids in Weight Management

White coffee can be a helpful addition to a weight loss plan. The high caffeine content boosts metabolism, increases fat burning, and suppresses appetite, making it easier to control calorie intake.

# 5. Gentle on the Stomach

One of the major benefits of white coffee is its lower acidity. Many people experience acid reflux, heartburn, or stomach irritation after drinking regular coffee. White coffee is milder and easier on the stomach, making it a better choice for those with digestive issues.

# 6. Rich in Essential Nutrients

Since white coffee undergoes minimal roasting, it retains more essential nutrients such as magnesium, potassium, and B vitamins. These nutrients support overall health, improve muscle function, and boost the immune system.

# 7. Helps Reduce the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

White coffee contains chlorogenic acid, which has been shown to help regulate blood sugar levels. Drinking white coffee may improve insulin sensitivity and lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

# 8. Enhances Brain Function and Reduces Risk of Neurodegenerative Diseases

The high caffeine and antioxidant content in white coffee support brain health. Regular consumption may help reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s by protecting brain cells from damage.

# 9. Promotes Liver Health

Studies suggest that coffee drinkers have a lower risk of liver diseases, including fatty liver and cirrhosis. White coffee, with its high antioxidant levels, can further support liver function and detoxification.

# 10. Improves Mood and Reduces Stress

Caffeine stimulates the release of dopamine and serotonin, the brain’s feel-good chemicals. This can help improve mood, reduce stress, and lower the risk of depression.

# How to Brew White Coffee

Brewing white coffee requires a slightly different method due to its hard and dense texture. Here’s how to prepare a perfect cup:

1. **Grind the Beans Properly** – White coffee beans are harder than regular coffee beans, so they require a special grinder. You can also buy pre-ground white coffee.

2. **Use an Espresso Machine or French Press** – White coffee is best brewed using an espresso machine or a French press. It may not work well with a traditional drip coffee maker.

3. **Experiment with Ratios** – White coffee has a strong, nutty flavor. You can adjust the coffee-to-water ratio to suit your taste.

4. **Add Your Favorite Extras** – White coffee pairs well with milk, honey, or cinnamon for extra flavor and health benefits.

# Where to Buy White Coffee

White coffee is becoming more widely available, and you can find it at specialty coffee shops, online retailers, and health-focused stores. Look for high-quality, organic white coffee for the best flavor and health benefits.

# Final Thoughts

White coffee is not just another trendy drink—it’s a powerful, nutrient-rich beverage with multiple health benefits. From boosting energy and metabolism to improving heart and brain health, white coffee offers a unique and healthy alternative to traditional coffee. If you’re looking for a super drink that combines great taste with health benefits, white coffee is definitely worth trying!

The corporation that laid me off paid for a career coach to help me find my next role, and the coach has been telling me to build my network on LinkedIn by reaching out to people in my industry. 

Last week I messaged a woman who had some mutual connections, and she said she might have some freelance work for me at her ""marketing"" company. We met for coffee and she was saying stuff about how she's a millionaire and it's such a shame they don't teach anything about personal finance in school. Alarm bells were going off but she wanted to introduce me to her business partner and talk about how I could fit into their company, and I figured I could use the interview experience. 

Well, prior to the meeting she sent me some reading to discuss about their ""business model"" and it was just a chapter from a book by Robert Kiyosaki, the Rich Dad Poor Dad guy! I immediately canceled the meeting and blocked her. I just re-listened to the Rich Dad Poor Dad episode and realized this woman's whole philosophy was based on Kiyosaki's grift. 

I'm mad that I spent any of my time talking to her, but I'm so glad I didn't waste any more time listening to an MLM pitch thanks to Michael and Peter. In the episode Michael talks about the book Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry, and I just got it from the library.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

When I was a kid, I was always super boyish—I hung out with the boys, played like the boys, but I didn’t mind being called a girl or anything. I also wore a lot of girly clothes, but that was mostly because (1) hand-me-downs, and (2) I just didn’t care that much at the time. Then, as I got older and realized I was (at the time) a lesbian, I felt this weird pressure to go ultra-feminine—partly because I grew up in a small conservative town, and blending in as straight felt safer. I think I mistook that safety for authenticity, if that makes sense?

So yeah, for years I leaned heavily into feminine fashion, but recently I had this realization that maybe that was never really me. It all kind of spiraled from one small thing: changing my name. I’ve always wanted to, and I finally picked something more gender-neutral. And suddenly, BOOM—identity crisis unlocked. People started they/them-ing me more, which felt right. Then, someone referred to me as my roommate’s “hot older brother,” and I don’t know why, but that sent me into a full existential moment. Like, wait… do I actually want to be perceived that way? Turns out, yeah, kinda.

Then I started thinking—if I could just respawn in a different body, what would I look like? And the answer was very specific: hot, hipster white (because I am white) Jesus with a beard, long hair in a half-up man bun, and the general energy of someone who owns too many rings and is really passionate about coffee and steak. Problem is… that’s not what I look like. At all. My body is super feminine—hourglass shape, soft round face—and on top of that, I have body dysmorphia, which makes trying to dress more masculine so complicated. If I wear oversized, baggy clothes to hide my curves, I just feel huge, and that messes with me in a different way. So now I’m attempting to go for an emo boy aesthetic instead, which I also vibe with, and at least that feels like a happy medium.

The weird part? I don’t actually feel dysphoria about my body when I’m alone. It’s more about how other people see me. I don’t want to change my body, I don’t think I’d ever want hormones, but I do want to be perceived as more masculine. And now I’m staring at my closet full of extremely feminine clothes like, “well, shit.” 

Also, I’m even wondering if it’s even safe to come out right now since I’m in America — perfect time for a gender crisis, right?

Anyway, does anyone else relate to this kind of experience? Trying to figure out how to be true to yourself without feeling like you’re forcing something that doesn’t fit? Also, if anyone has tips on dressing more androgynous without feeling like a literal blob, I’m all ears.

Based on the title, alam kong some of you would understand already yung nangyari. pero tangina sobrang sakit lang kasi. 

For context, we’re live-in almost our entire relationship. Totoo nga na makikilala mo ang tao pag nakasama mo sa iisang bubong. Pero hindi ko inasahan na ganito. 

Yesterday, sasamahan ko dapat syang magpaship ng mga item nya from his business. Bago kami bumangon, I asked him if he could make me coffee with matching pabebe. Tangina sagot ba naman sakin, “ibibili na lang kita kesa ipagtimpla kita” he thought he ate 💀 grabe yung epekto sakin, nadown ako nang sobra. Like, in my head, “ganun ba ako nakakatamad na pag effortan”. Hindi ko alam pero talagang nalungkot ako nung narinig ko yun. And this is not the first time that this kind of scenario happened. But hearing those words, nakakalungkot sobra. 

Imagine, partner mo yun hahaha tapos ganun sasabihin mo. Usually sa mga partner natin we like to do things that would make them smile/happy di ba? Idk i cant explain it fully. 

For instance, ako gusto ko syang sinasamahan sa mga lakad nya minsan knowing na wala syang friends na sasama sa kanya. And he would always talk about how nice it is na may kaibigang naaaya ganun. So I always asks him na samahan ko sya sa ganito ganyan nya kung gusto nya or okay lang sa kanya. But sometimes, namimisinterpret pa nya yon hahahahah. 

I will not go into details kasi masyado na tong mahaba.

Went today (around 10A) and for the first time (in months) it was a quiet monday working crowd. 
Seats were still available, no one was holding council/meetings on speaker phone, no one was loud, music was at a decent volume, playlist was a chill youtube studybeats vibe, matcha was perfect temp & taste.

*And all of a sudden i hear this agitating, grating voice*

A french couple with a toddler comes in talking at the top of their lungs, followed by several hipsters, some futurama looking homeless guy lingering out front, the wifi goes out & then a bitcoin bro with an ear piece enters left talking about stocks.

The peace is ruined at this establishment. 
Im aware in the afternoons/evenings, this place is more casual and lax but at this point, they dont even wait till noon.

What other niche, QUIET coffee shops have yall found in the Houston area?
Particularly near downtown areas, midtown/montrose or even washington street?

Screaming filled the cavern, none of it human. Echoes filled the air until a constant, hungry roar resounded across the Rock.

When the alarm went up, the people of the city were already either armed, or barricaded inside. All of it happened in orderly fashion.

“What are they saying?” Vergil grabbed a soldier’s wrist as the woman ran past him in the narrow street. “What are those alarms?”

“Invasion.” The soldier wrenched her arm free and sprinted away.

The other soldiers joined her at a quick trot, not sparing more of their time.

“You’re going in the wrong direction,” Vergil called after them, but none seemed to have heard him.

Alarms and whistles now screamed across the city. Shouts. Calls to action. Orders. How anyone could operate in that chaos of noise was beyond him.

Sil leaned against a wall, staining it red with her blood. She held her arm tight against her chest, only slivers of her shirt covering the bloody mess that remained of the limb. With gritted teeth, she tried to speak. Only hiccuped and cringed in pain.

There was almost no skin left on her arm, just raw, bleeding muscle. Vergil shuddered imagining the pain.

She’d handled her goddess’s aid back in Grefe. Why was the effect so bad here?

“Can I help somehow?” he asked, approaching. “Luna can you—”

He wanted to ask the spider to bind the wound. There would be no binding that damage. It looked liked Sil was doing everything she could to keep flesh from slouching off bone, one hand gripping desperately on the exposed muscle. The spider shifted on his back.

“This one does not know how to help. I require Knowing. This one can offer venom to ease the pain.”

Sil shook her head mutely, tears streaming down her face. Luna’s bite would render her unconscious, but that would sever the tether to the helmet. They needed the dwarf’s strength.

A soldier flashed by and nearly knocked her down before Vergil could intervene. Sil screamed in agony, her voice a mewling wail.

He could try and get her to the ward up there, but with the chaos down here it was hard to imagine how he’d manage.

* *Leave the wench.*
* *Fight! Go fight!*
* *Quit lulling aboot an’ go an’ fight!*
* *Move yer damn feet, sprig!*
* *There’s killin’ afoot.*

He itched to go fight. But Tallah was up at the fortress, not here to take charge. Did she even know this was happening?

Every heartbeat of indecision was more blood lost by Sil. Her cries stopped but she still couldn’t speak for the pain.

He would do what he’d been tasked to do.

The soldiers could handle whatever it was that slithered out of that hole. He was to guard Sil. Tallah had never relieved him of that duty, and he’d never disappoint her.

“This will hurt. I’m sorry.”

Sil’s pride would sting, but that was a later consideration. She already hated being carried and… well, there was no other way to get a healer to her quickly enough. Vergil scooped her up into his arms and ran, aware at every moment of the spreading puddle of warmth against his chest, cooling as it ran down his stomach and legs.

He’d been covered in Sil’s blood often enough to hate the feeling of it anywhere near him.

She shuddered in his arms. They were far from the stairs. And the way there would be contested. While he ran, she kept trying to call forth the goddess’s aid. Only managed fragments of words.

Vergil’s growing anger lent him wings.

*Bloody machine spirit. Sent a nuke through her. We’re not all monsters like Tallah.*

It was an uncharitable thought, but how otherwise would Sil’s wounds be explained? Panacea had given her the ability to destroy monsters with a touch, but how much power did that require? Someone like Tallah could channel that. He’d seen her chasing after the dragon. Sil? He was certain she didn’t have even a quarter of the sorceress’s raw power.

What was Panacea even thinking at this? Was she?

“Vergil!”

He skidded to a halt a the sound of his name, looking wildly about. Sil’s good hand gripped his shoulder with desperate strength.

Arin came jogging from a side street, waving. The soldier was half-dressed, as if he’d been woken by the alarm. He had his shield though, but was missing a sword.

Whatever he came to ask died on his lips as he took in the burden Vergil carried.

“The ward?” Arin asked simply.

Vergil nodded shortly.

“I’ll lead.” His tone brokered no argument.

Arin drew his sword from Vergil’s scabbard and ran on ahead, shield up, opening the way through the people moving about in the street.

“Luna, run alongside him. Warn us of danger.”

The spider leapt off his back.

Vergil took off after him, the run easier now that he didn’t need to worry about knocking everyone out of his way. A wave of relief helped him find his good cheer.

“We’ll get you fixed in no time, Sil,” he said, trying to sound encouraging. “You did good back there. We would’ve died if you hadn’t used that ray thing.”

She shuddered in his arms, her good hand making a fist and knocking against his shoulder. She was still with him, conscious. Still, no words.

Arin turned down a jutting side street and Vergil followed. It wasn’t the direct way to the stairs up into the fortress proper, but he trusted the soldier had a better understanding of the city’s layout.

And he was right. Without Arin he would’ve never found his way through the twisting maze that followed. The way was narrow, barely enough for a man to cross it running. Vergil had to slither sideways not to bang Sil’s head against the encroaching walls.

“It’s a tight squeeze, but it’s quicker,” Arin said as he stopped and looked out into an intersecting street, sword held at the ready. “Careful of the murder holes.”

“The what?” Only then did Vergil see the gaps in the stone.

Small windows, the size of a palm at best, just enough for a spear to pass through. One opened right next to Vergil’s head and a pair of eyes regarded him for a heartbeat. He thought the person behind that nodded at him.

Any monster following would find themselves in quite a bind.

* *Human coward!*
* *Arse licker.*
* *Dry shite!*

Horvath was clearly unhappy being denied the fight. Vergil did his best to ignore him even if he also itched for a fight. No, that wasn’t for now. That was the soldiers’ work, even if he and Sil were the reason the invasion even began.

*I’m being daft. The dwarf’s messing with me.*

Several intersection later, and down a couple blind alleys that ultimately opened up into secretive corridors, they emerged into the main thoroughfare leading to the Rock’s central fountain.

Luna let out a warning cry just before they stepped out into the light.

A goatman rammed into Arin from the side as he emerged. It was testament to the soldier’s reflexes that the caught the goring blow on his shield rather than his shoulder. The sword swung with amazing speed and precision. He buried it into the goatman’s neck. Black blood spurted. A kick sent the writhing creature down the steps.

“They got in deep,” the soldier huffed. He looked around. “Who warned us?” Luna kept out of sight.

Looking over the city, Vergil could spy fighting clusters all throughout. Were there more holes like the one they’d found? Maybe. Or… maybe there was something else at play?

“Come, come,” Arin urged him.

He didn’t head down to kill the beastman but left it screaming in agony. It would draw more of its brethren probably.

Vergil obeyed and began climbing the wide stairs. He didn’t know this way, their access normally done through a side route, Tallah’s route leading directly into the tavern.

Arin put his fingers to his lips and whistled out a long, shrill note. Several moments later, several similar tunes answered. Vergil didn’t know what those meant.

Bellows and howls also answered the call, creatures erupting out from hiding places. The first, a wolfman carrying a large, rusted sword, came bounding at them. Vergil prepared to turn and ram his shoulder into the creature’s gaping maw. An arrow split the wolf-like head mid-leap. A corpse crashed to the ground for Vergil to leap over. Sil let out a pained cry at the jolt.

“I’m sorry. We’re almost there. Hang on.” He gritted his teeth. “We’re almost there, Sil. You’ll be fine. I promise.”

Her fist knocked into his shoulder again, strength fleeing waning.

Every surprise attacker was met by arrows. They had guardians up there, all focused on Arin as he took the stairs two at a time, stopping from time to time to wait for Vergil.

He was beginning to tire when a mob of beastmen charged from the wrong end of the stairs. They were coming down from the courtyard above, weapons glinting in the torchlight, fangs bared.

How? Wasn’t Tallah up there?

The first one, Arin met on his shield. Impossibly fast, he smashed the creature in the chest, lifted it off the ground and slammed it to the floor. His sword stabbed down as he held the body down with a foot. The one that attacked next was skewered through the eyeball by an arrow.

Again, the full might of the Rock’s soldiers was on display here. He heard no cussing, just whistling and terse orders.

Arin cut a path for him upward, drawing the attackers to him like moths to a flame.

“Go. Go,” he ordered in a huff. “Get her to safety, then come help.”

Vergil didn’t need telling twice. All Hell was breaking loose in the Rock and somehow he didn’t think it had all to do with the hole they’d discovered, despite Horvath needling him. Sil whimpered in his arms, face gone deathly pale with blood loss. The helmet’s strength had begun waning, as if the tether was fading. If she still had resources, it was taking all her strength now to keep him powered.

A familiar weight landed on his back.

He sprinted the final set, desperate energy lending him wings. He missed the final one. Stumbled. Kept running. There was the ward, just ahead through a cacophony of fighting.

* *Watch above!*
* *More vermin be comin’ down.*

The sky darkened and Vergil slipped to a halt on the churned mud. He backtracked desperately as a ball of bodies dropped crashed just paces away from him. They were being flung over the wall again, though the chaos looked to be contained. Tallah wasn’t fighting yet, or she was somewhere farther up on the wall.

He didn’t wait around for the monsters to gather their wits. Neither did the soldiers. They flung down weighted nets. Others with spears struck the creatures while they were still entangled. Silver shone in the light of the Mother moon.

Vergil ran past them all, jumped over the odd corpse in his way, and reached the ward. Relief flooded his veins as he crossed the threshold.

Adella was there, working on the wounded in the main ward. He recognized her in an instant, and she his burden. She rushed over from the soldier she’d been sewing.

“Was she bit by something?” she asked.

“No. Hard to explain. Arm. Bad.”

Sil couldn’t lift her arm, though she tried. She couldn’t pull it away from her chest when Vergil set her down on a spare pail. The girl ran off, calling for anyone with allotment left.

Vergil’s heart thundered in his ears, the toll of a bell that ominously ticked down Sil’s life. His mind raced.

Why did it feel like tonight was some sort of turning point? What was happening? Were the daemons in a panic over the discovery? Or was something else afoot?

He gripped Sil’s good hand, refusing to look over at her mangled one. Her gripping back centred him.

“I’m here, Sil. Your girl’s bringing help. Hold on a little longer.” Blood pooled on the pail of straw and dripped to the floor. He thought he could make out every *drip drip drip* sound as more of the healer’s vitality drained away. Her lips had gone the pale colour of paper.

*She didn’t hesitate for a moment.*

The scene of her raising the already hurt arm and taking aim, as if the pain meant nothing, replayed in his mind. He’d never forget it. Was that courage? Or insanity?

“Hang on, Sil,” he whispered, squeezing her fingers. “After tonight, we’ll talk. I need you to tell me what hurts. Ok?”

He also remembered Bront’s words in the tavern, that it looked like she had some stuff to work through. Was something wrong that she wasn’t telling him or Tallah?

Every time he’d fallen, she’d dragged him back up. Sometimes literally kicked him upright. Maybe it was time he did the same?

For now, the waiting was driving him ragged. There was a rush of bodies coming and going. Soldiers limping away to rejoin the fight. Healers carrying bandages. The stink of blood mixing in with disinfectant. The maddening *drip drip drip* sound.

More blood coated his fingers. He wouldn’t have noticed if not for the warmth. It brought him out of his stupor. Sil’s arm—the good one!—was drenched in blood, the sleeve of her shirt almost black. He’d seen this before, back in Grefe.

Panacea?

He rolled up the sleeve and peered at the words carving themselves into Sil’s flesh.

“Do not abuse. Fatal. Can’t see you. Keep this hidden. More to come.” He read the tiny words written in Earth Standard and quickly pulled down the sleeve.

Luna climbed off his back and nestled itself next to Sil, turning the colour of the pail. “This one bite?”

Vergil shook his head. Sil would be healed. Then she would want to get to work. She’d be furious with him if he allowed her to be knocked out entirely. The squeeze of her hand on his said as much.

Finally, the girl returned with another one, yanking her forward through the crowd at near a run as could be managed in the tight space. It spoke of their long, unpleasant practice that they asked no questions. The new girl set her hand on Sil’s chest and finally spoke the words Vergil longed to hear.

“*I require this one be mended.”*

White light embalmed Sil. Her back arched. Her teeth gritted together so hard that they screeched like nails on steel. She shuddered once. Twice. Then dropped heavily on the bed, breath quick and shallow.

The scary girl pulled the cork off a vial with her teeth. She spat it away then turned to the other girl. “Get back to your work, Castien. I have her.” The other one nodded twice, hesitated for a moment, then left to see about some other wounded.

The healer slipped her hand under Sil’s head and raised it slightly. “Open her mouth,” she ordered.

Vergil did. Together, they poured the bloodberry tonic down her throat. It worked quickly.

Sil’s eyes fluttered open. She took one look about then tried to rise. Vergil had to restrain her.

“You need… you need to rest, Sil.”

“Bugger off.” She shrugged free of him and managed to rise into a sitting position. Then she turned to the girl. “Adella, how many wounded tonight?”

“Baker’s dozen in the critical ward,” she answered crisply, offering her arm to help Sil rise. “Could use your allotment, lady Iluna. If you’re up for it.”

Sil tried to find her feet. Her arm had regrown skin and looked like a writhing mess of scar tissue just barely holding together. It shook violently as she tried to press weight on it.

“I need another bloodberry. Coffee. Dissolve iron-leaf in it for me. Do you have?”

“Yes, lady Iluna.”

“Get me that.”

Vergil helped her rise, then held her up. For a time, she allowed it. “Had to use one of my prayers earlier. I’ll see to the worst cases. Vergil, get me there.”

Adella rushed away to get what she’d demanded. Vergil leaned into Sil’s ear and whispered, “There was a message. From the goddess.”

Sil flinched slightly at that. “Felt it. Fine bloody time she chose. What did it say?”

He told her and she nodded. “Figures. Gave me a weapon to kill myself with. Story of my bloody life.”

She shuddered and shook free of him before entering the critical ward, the first few steps awkward and unsteady. When he tried to help again, she waved him off. Instead, she turned to Luna and, with a tap on her shoulder, invited the spider to join her.

“Lost my bloody staff,” Sil complained. Then she seemed to remember Vergil was still there. “Stop gaping like an idiot and go help.” Her voice was back to her usual whip-like quality of when she worked, like a switch had been turned in her head. All fatigue forgotten. All pain ignored. “I’m surrounded by my kind. I daresay I’ll survive just fine here. Get going.”

For emphasis, she drew out a bag of ink nettle dust and inhaled it all in a single breath.

Vergil reassessed his impression of Sil. She was every bit as monstrous as Tallah, just in a different way. “How far can I range?” he asked, hand gripping his axe.

“I can manage it all the way to the end of the city. See that you seal that hole.” When he didn’t immediately move, she snapped at him angrily. “Go, boy. We’ve both work to do.”

He nodded once and took off at a run from the infirmary. Sil knew her business. Now, he knew his.

A soldier called to him by name as he bolted towards the stairs. Violet. She was the captain’s aide from the previous day. She threw him a silver sword. “Take care of it. I want it back,” she called as he snatched the scabbard out of the air. She was already moving up onto the wall, heedless of the raining bodies.

* *Finally grew a spine.*

“Fuck off,” Vergil grunted. “I know my priorities.”

* *Get yer arse back t’ th’ hole.*
* *All o’ this is shite.*

The dwarf radiated fury like never before. He kept talking as Vergil walked.

* *This be how Lang was taken.*
* *This be how they buggered us.*
* *This be how I fell!*
* *Pay attention sprig and mark mah words.*
* *I will not allow it again!*

Vergil could feel the presence in his head straining against Argia’s bondage, every psychic fibre of Horvath yearning for this fight. *Well, tough luck! This is my fight. You get to watch, dwarf.*

Vergil ran down the stairs, leapt off the final dozen, and plunged down onto a beastman’s shoulders, sword stabbing down through the collar bone. Horvath’s skill or his own, it made very little difference just then as the monster thrashed under his weight. The soldiers it had been fighting wasted no time in skewering the beast.

Arin was there, blood spattered, sword red with gore. He gave a nod and turned to head down into the melee several steps below. From the stairs they could see the main plaza of the city, with the Ascendi shard spinning in place there. Daemons roiled around it.

Smoke and ash coiled in the air. Flames bellowed out of some windows. There was a pulsing cacophony of chaotic noise echoing maddeningly. The stench of fire and death gagged the senses.

Chaos was in full bloom here, and it needed to be contained.

Vergil grabbed the soldier’s arm and pointed with the sword towards the far end of the cavern.

“There’s a hole over there, by the gardens.” He looked out better then swung his sword in the opposite direction. “Wrong way. I think that’s where they’re coming from.”

Arin took no time in reacting. He whistled and all of a sudden Vergil was surrounded by an entire squad of soldiers.

“There’s a breach,” Arin explained. “We fight our way to it. We seal it. Everything else is now of secondary concern.”

Everyone turned and stared at Vergil, the weight of expectant eyes falling onto his shoulders. It took several heartbeats for him to stammer out his response. “At the gardens. With the berries. There’s a very strong daemon there. There may be more. We killed three.”

Again, everyone just stared. Didn’t they believe him?

Thoughts?,"I stay home with our two kids, (6m and 4yo.) my husband works full time, has a business, and we own 2 investment properties. My husband makes a fair amount of money, and I honestly don’t even know where it goes. He’s not gambling and likely saves a lot of it but I have no way of knowing if that’s $5k or $50k. 

If something gets refunded, I have no way of knowing if it processed or not. Half the time he turns off cards so I can’t even use them. I am not using them frivolously - I’m talking for things like gas and groceries or necessities for kids. I can’t even count the number of times I’ve asked it to be unlocked, gone to check out, only to be told the card won’t process. It’s humiliating. 

I get $300/month ‘allowance’ that usually goes towards any self care things (like makeup or if I need shampoo etc) and the rest I end up spending on things for the kids that are non-necessities.

We are not struggling financially. I’m not out spending hoards of money on anything. I feel like I should be fine to buy the occasional ‘coffee syrup’ or whatever from Amazon or Walmart without having to ask for a card to be turned on. He’ll turn it on for a short period and then randomly turn it off again. (Turned off today because I bought raspberry syrup to make dirty soda when my mom visits.) 

I’ve requested access multiple times. He said he was adding me as a user and did not. He said he would give me statements and does not. He’s super frugal, so I’m not worried about him being in mountains of debt or anything it’s just the ‘controlling af’ aspect of it that drives me up a wall. 

He does help with cleaning/vacuuming, and occasionally cooks. I get 40-60minutes/day without the kids and I’m obviously struggling with it. I love him, and this is only one aspect of our relationship but right now it’s really grating and making me resent him. Am I losing it or is that normal for SAHP?

I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this question, but I'll fire away anyway in the hope that someone can provide guidance...

At the weekend we flew with a group of others from the UK to Ireland for a birthday celebration.

On the short outbound flight, I ordered a coffee and was given some milk sachets. I added the milk but the the plastic lid split when trying to replace it. I asked the cabin attendant for a new lid but rather than handing me one she tried to fit the lid herself, same result. On the second attempt she leaned over with the lid and knocked a carton of cigarettes into the cup, which subsequently spilt all over me, badly scalding my stomach.

I was initially given cooling gel but this didn't have much effect, so the cabin crew offered to arrange for paramedics to attend upon arrival. After the other passengers had left the paramedic boarded the plane and spent around 20 minutes treating me.

I asked the crew for an accident form and they said that everything was handled on line now and I should just raise a case there. I'm guessing I was still in shock as I didn't take any further details such as names etc but assimg that Ryanair would be able to check.

So... I've raised my complaint today, and I'm just wondering if I can expect any recompense from Ryanair? Whilst it was an accident it had a major effect on our weekend as I was in a lot of pain.

Do I just follow the complaints process (which can apparently take 8 weeks for a response) or look at other options?

One last point, a friend who was also on the flight heard the cabin crew lead talking of getting stories straight before we landed, so ultimately it could be a case of my / our word against theirs as to who was at fault.

Any thoughts great appreciated, thanks in advance.

I recently had an amazing breakfast at a spot in Muswell Hill, it wasn’t marked as anything special on the menu or anything. It got me thinking: how could I share these kinds of discoveries with people who’d also appreciate them? I love finding hidden gems in the city: standout dishes on a menu, great happy hour deals, or limited-time specials that aren’t obvious from generic Google maps reviews.

I have some time on my hands and enjoy building apps, so I’m thinking of creating a platform where users can share and discover local gems. The idea:

- Users post about something exceptional, like “This coffee at Café so and so is unreal” or “This bar has 2-for-1 Negronis every Thursday.”
- Others can agree, comment, or call out if something’s overhyped.
- Businesses can post too, but the community keeps them accountable.
- You can follow specific areas and get notified about new posts near you.
- The focus is on quality, not just discounts. I'm not interested in promo spam.

However, on the weekends, i typically don't drink soda - I primary drink water & if I go out to eat or grab pickup I typically don't get soda, though occasionally I do. 

So during the week I'm usually getting at least 40-50mg (& up to about 100mg) of caffeine a day, & on the weekends it's typically 0.

Something I've noticed is that my weekends (3 days, i work 4x10s), I feel... Bad is a strong word, worse than normal? I have almost no motivation or energy do a lot and often don't feel well, at least like i do during the week.

1ix6z63,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1ix6z63/miraval_arizona_review/,Miraval Arizona Review,"Background: 

This is the second US all inclusive sans alcohol resort I have stayed at. I used points to pay for both stays (at Alila Ventana Big Sur  and Miraval Tucson). I have not stayed at any international resorts in Mexico or the Caribbeans. Since I use Reddit to read reviews of these stays, I wanted to pay it forward to anyone considering a stay.

\_\_\_\_\_

Perspective: 

I am in my 30s based in Northern California and food is the primary reason for travel. I enjoy eating food, and while I do not particularly enjoy Michelin restaurants, I can appreciate the service when it is experienced. Something about wrapping a napkin while I am in the restroom or scraping all the crumbs between tastings feels unnatural to me. I am happy eating at hole in the wall restaurants and can handle rude service, especially if the meal is tasty. As a reference, my favorite city to travel to is Tokyo, and I enjoy eating relatively affordable (everywhere is affordable compared to Bay Area) sushi, ramen, and Japanese curry.

\_\_\_\_\_

Prior experience at Big Sur Ventana:

I stayed at Alila Ventana Big Sur (VBS) with my partner in 2022. My understanding at the time was that it was after lifting COVID restrictions, so we were able to eat at the restaurant. It was also before the $10 room service surcharge that was recently added for each room service order (found out through friends that recently stayed at VBS). Our stay at VBS was in a hot tub suite, and it was booked before the category of VBS went up. Personally, I feel that the points required now at VBS are a bit unreasonable, but that’s how the game goes.

2022 VBS was great. The restaurant food was amazing - the courses were limited, but room service took care of that and the room service food was arguably just as good as the restaurant as it came from the same kitchen and traveled over to the rooms via golf carts. There weren’t a lot of free activities. We ended up walking around the property and hanging out in the pool during our stay. Since we had a hot tub in our suite, we did not use the pools. The staff service was amazing, with the exception of our one waitstaff in particular at the restaurant. Unfortunately, we had the same server at the restaurant on both nights during our stay and we felt she was relatively apathetic borderline rude to us compared to all the other staff during our stay. We did not see this particular server treat other groups the way they treated us during dinner service. It was possibly due to our ethnicity or our age, but that is an assumption that we made based on conjecture.

\_\_\_

Stay at Miraval Arizona:

We recently stayed at Miraval Tucson for 2 nights. I researched and found some Reddit threads and the general consensus was that Austin was better, to sign up for activities to fill your schedule, and use the resort credit for the cook for me dinner.

Miraval Tucson’s staff customer service was impeccable. Miraval had a private car waiting for us at the airport. The staff were friendly, and every request was enthusiastically filled. We could order as much as we wanted at the restaurant, and the smoothie/coffee bar was a frequent stop throughout our day.

The free activities at Miraval were enjoyable. We went on the on-site 2 hour guided hike, took some classes, and my partner got a massage. She had a relaxing experience at the spa, and the classes were dependent on the teacher. We unexpectedly enjoyed the photography class due to our classmates having a fun sense of humor.

It could be the Californian perspective, but for a wellness resort that advertised wellness, health, and meat free options, the lack of composting and recycling bins was peculiar. The food source also wasn’t clearly documented on the menus, which coming from California, seems to be a standard that I have come to appreciate and immediately notice when it’s not communicated.

The Just Cook For Me class was $189, and it was enjoyable interacting with the chef and watching them cook. We were able to ask questions or watch them cook, but we also could have easily kicked back and relaxed. The menu was mostly plant based with a wine tasting to go along with each course. The mostly plant based menu felt unsubstantial, but we can order food from the restaurant or bar afterwards if we wanted more food. It also would have been nice to know where the ingredients were sourced from, but that might be the California influence creating bias that may not apply to everyone.

We felt the food at Miraval wasn’t as impressive as VBS, but the activities and classes made Miraval enjoyable. It allowed more interactions with other guests and staff, while BSV allowed you to disconnect and you rarely saw other guests on the property.

The room at Miraval Arizona was also not as nice at VBS. The bed was very soft and the floors felt loose and creaked. It would be unfair to compare it to a suite at VBS, but I can imagine the regular room at BSV would be nicer.

The free water bottle provided at VBS was also a lot nicer than the free one at Miraval. By no means a dealbreaker, but something to keep in mind.

\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR: if both VBS and Miraval Tucson costed the same amount, we would have picked BSV. Miraval food options were not particularly impressive, the food at VBS was more memorable. The resort credit and scheduled activities at Miraval were fun, and it helped keep the day interesting with an itinerary planned.

For context, I train 4-5 days a week with a push/pull/legs split with a mix of compound and isolation movements.

Push: Incline barbell/dumbbell press, machine chest press & flys, lateral raises, triceps pushdowns.
Pull: Deadlifts, weighted pull-ups, lat pulldowns, barbell rows, bicep curls, rear delt flys.
Legs: Squats, Romanian deadlifts, leg press/extensions, hip thrusts, calf raises. 

My diet is mostly clean:
Pre-workout: Black coffee and bananas
Breakfast: Whey (though I’ve recently had to scale back a bit) with milk, oatmeal topped with dry fruits
Lunch: A couple of chapatis with dry sabzi and a 2-egg omelette
Dinner: Either 200g roasted chicken breast with rice (with sauces) or paneer with rice

Perfect! Authentic branding is the secret sauce that turns you from a “manager with a nameplate” into a “leader with a legacy.”

Let’s break this down step by step—minus the jargon and with a few laughs along the way.

1. Own Your Story (No Edits, No Filters)

Your story is your brand’s foundation. People connect with people, not perfect resumes. Did you start your career with a door slammed in your face? Did you accidentally spill coffee on your boss on Day One? Perfect! Share it.

Why it works: Authenticity isn’t about being flawless—it’s about being real. Your setbacks wins, and lessons shape the “why” behind what you do.

Example: Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx, openly talks about how she failed the LSAT twice and sold fax machines door-to-door before hitting gold. That rawness made her relatable and gave her brand a human touch.

Action Step: Write down three pivotal moments in your life that shaped your leadership style. Share them in speeches, blogs, or social media posts. (But no Photoshop-ing your past to look cooler!)

2. Consistency is Amazing

Imagine if The Coca-Cola Company changed its logo every three months. Confusing, right? The same goes for personal branding. You can’t be a “quirky entrepreneur” on LinkedIn, a “strict boss” in team meetings, and a “wannabe comedian” in your keynotes. People trust what’s consistent.

Why it works: Consistency creates predictability, and predictability builds trust. People should know what to expect from you—whether it’s your values, your voice, or your favorite blazer color.

Example: Oprah. You know you’re getting empathy, empowerment, and maybe a book recommendation. Oprah’s always Oprah, whether she’s interviewing a celebrity or launching her wellness line.

Action Step: Pick three core values (like empathy, creativity, or innovation) and ensure your actions, posts, and conversations align with them. Think of these as your personal branding GPS.

3. Be Vulnerable (But Don’t Overdo It)

Vulnerability is powerful, but oversharing can turn into a cringe-fest. There’s a fine line between “Here’s how I overcame my struggles” and “I cried in the bathroom three times last week, and here’s why…”

Why it works: When you show you’re human, people see themselves in you. They think, “If this person can rise above challenges, so can I.”

Example: Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson often shares moments of struggle, like his mental health battles or career roadblocks. But he balances vulnerability with positivity, keeping the focus on overcoming, not wallowing.

Action Step: Share a professional challenge you’ve faced and how you solved it. End it with a takeaway for your audience. Vulnerability isn’t about dumping your baggage; it’s about showing growth.

4. Walk the Talk

Here’s the thing: You can slap “integrity” and “teamwork” all over your website, but if you’re screaming at interns over coffee spills, guess what? People will see through you faster than a cheap umbrella in a thunderstorm.

Why it works: Your actions are your loudest branding statement. If you claim to value innovation, show it—experiment, fail, learn, and share the journey.

Example: Elon Musk doesn’t just preach innovation—he risks it. From launching rockets that sometimes crash to sleeping at Tesla factories during crunch time, his actions reinforce his brand as a relentless innovator.

Action Step: Write down your top three leadership values. Now, check if your day-to-day actions align with those values. If not, start making small changes. Remember, credibility is earned, not declared.

5. Show Up and Engage (Beyond the Spotlight)

Leaders who hide behind their titles are about as inspiring as a blank wall. Get out there. Talk to your team. Respond to comments. Speak at events. Authentic branding thrives on connection.

Why it works: Engagement shows you’re approachable, and approachability builds trust. People don’t just want a boss—they want someone who’s in the trenches with them.

Example: Richard Branson is known for his hands-on leadership style. He doesn’t just sit in boardrooms; he’s out there kite-surfing with employees or listening to customer feedback. This accessibility makes his brand magnetic.

Action Step: Spend 15 minutes daily engaging with your audience—reply to comments, share meaningful posts, or even ask your team for input on a project. It’s the small interactions that build the biggest bridges.

Branding is a Marathon, Not a Sprint

Authentic branding isn’t about slapping on a new persona or reciting leadership buzzwords. It’s about digging deep, owning your story, and living your values—every single day.

And hey, it’s not rocket science (thank goodness, because who has time for that?). Start with small, consistent steps. Soon, you’ll build a brand so authentic that people won’t just follow you—they’ll champion you.

And it’s not just because I love coffee, I mean we all do, right?



It’s because I was a part of one of the leading coffee businesses in the UK for years. We tested coffee types, machines, brew methods, recipes…you name it. 



Thing is, you can get cafe-quality coffee at home for a fraction of the cost per cup (if you divide the number of cups you make with the amount you invest in coffee machines.) whenever you want it. 



Now, there are three coffee machines on my radar that are amazing if you’re just starting out your journey with espresso machines, [Chefwave Espresso Machine](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B07S2T5NZV), [Casabrews Espresso Machine with Grinder](https://new-releases.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B0C533HGCS) and [Casabrews Espresso Machine Without Grinder. ](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B0D53126XJ)



Getting a machine with a grinder is always good if you love to grind your beans fresh. But it also takes a bit more time, so that decision’s totally on you.

# My Final Thoughts

✔ **Best Overall**: Casabrews (Without Grinder) – If you have a good grinder (like the Encore), this is **the best choice** for **amazing espresso**.

✔ **Best All-in-One**: Casabrews (With Grinder) – A **convenient** choice for those who **don’t want to buy a separate grinder**.

✔ **Best Budget Option**: Chefwave – **Cheaper, smaller, decent** for beginners but **not as high-end** as Casabrews.

                          Finding Blossom

Blossom never thought she'd leave everything behind. Her family, her home, the life she had once known—it was all in the past now. She told herself it was for happiness, for love, for something that made her feel alive. But as she sat in her small apartment, the flickering screen of her camera reflecting back at her, she wondered if she had made the right choice.
Growing up, Blossom has always felt very misunderstood by her schoolmates and also family. They were overbearing, constantly needing her for everything while disregarding her emotions. She learned at an early age to be alone, to rely on herself because no one else truly saw her. She was never close to either side of her family, so when the time came, leaving was easier than she expected. But the damage had already been done. Her escape had always been alcohol—something that allowed her to leave her life behind, even if only for a few hours.
She had started vlogging out of loneliness, recording her morning coffee rituals, her long walks through the city, the moments that made her feel like she was still present in the world. Her viewers became her only real connection, strangers offering support and advice she struggled to take for herself. But she still felt lost. She still reached for the bottle at the end of each night, drowning out the ache of uncertainty. Days would pass where she wouldn’t even change her clothes, too caught up in her haze to pick up the camera, to create anything, to face herself. The only thing that kept her going was the vague idea that one day, things would change.
One afternoon, while editing at a coffee shop, she met Malcolm. He was confident, charming, the kind of man who walked into a room and owned it without even trying. He noticed her struggling with her footage and struck up a conversation. What started as a polite exchange turned into an effortless connection. He saw through her defenses, saw the person she was trying so hard to piece together.
Over time, Malcolm became a steady presence in her life, encouraging her to see herself beyond the camera lens. But as their bond deepened, so did her self-doubt. The whispers in her mind grew louder: He could do better than you. You’re broken. You’ll never be enough. Her drinking worsened. She ignored the messages from her family, the people she had once left behind. She felt like a fraud, an unfinished puzzle with too many missing pieces. She tried to quit, tried to find new ways to fill the emptiness—reading, journaling, standing in front of the mirror and trying to appreciate her own beauty. But nothing ever stuck, and the bottle always found its way back into her hands.
Then, she lost her grandmother. The only person who had ever shown her unconditional love was gone. The grief swallowed her whole, making her question everything. She wasn’t just mourning her grandmother; she was mourning her old self, the girl who had once believed she could escape, who had thought that leaving would bring her peace.
One night, after one too many drinks, she found herself calling Malcolm in tears. ""I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know who I am without this... without this feeling."" He didn’t hesitate. He came, held her through the storm, and when she collapsed, he made sure she got help.
Waking up in a hospital bed was a sobering reality. The world outside kept moving, but she had been stuck, drowning in her own misery. And yet, as she looked at Malcolm, the only person who had stayed, she realized something important: her journey wasn’t about having all the answers. It was about believing she was worth finding them.
As she recovered, her vlogs changed. Now, she used them not just to connect, but to help others going through the same struggles. She shared her story—the highs and the lows, the setbacks and victories. She still didn’t have it all figured out, but that was okay. She found joy in the small things—sunsets, laughter, the smell of coffee in the morning. She was still Blossom, still uncertain, but no longer afraid of the unknown. And for the first time, she was sure of one thing: she didn’t need to be perfect to be happy. She just needed to keep moving forward.

I’m part Chinese but don’t speak or understand Mandarin so there is a language barrier for me. My aunt brought me to a TCM practitioner in a very busy, but sketchy office. It was crowded but there was absolutely no privacy amongst other patients (it was a small, crowded room where everyone could hear everything) and my “appointment” was less than 5 mins. I’m looking for help in trying to decipher what my diagnosis means. 

The TCM practitioner took my pulse only yelled “frozen heart!” to me. He said my heart was very cold and that I was a high risk to have a heart attack. I was shocked and confused. Aside from anxiety (I used to take meds over 10 years ago but nothing recent), I don’t have any heart issues, problems or symptoms I know about. All my regular checkups at the GP have been fine, no ongoing health issues or illnesses. I rarely get sick, got sick once this year and before that it was Covid in 2021. 

All he would tell me was to stop eating salads, cold food, cold drinks, absolutely no fruits, little meat - and when I asked him to clarify, he basically mocked me and embarrassed me in front of the room, everyone laughed who could understand. It was such a humiliating experience. My aunt later gave me this list of typical TCM diet related restrictions while taking the herbal medicine, such as warm foods only, avoiding spicy foods, no coffee/tea, eating simple meals: green leafy vegetables, congee, rice, whole grains. 

Is anyone familiar with what a cold heart means and how that can lead to a heart attack? I am so confused because this is not what I expected (he didn’t ask me for any background information or why I was even coming) and this came out of no where. I’d love to do some research of my own but my google searches aren’t leading me to anywhere that matches what my current dietary restrictions now are. How do fruits come into play? What kind of search terms should I be using? 

I thought my diet was relatively healthy as I usually just eat a protein (chicken breast, turkey, eggs, rarely beef, etc) on top of a bed of greens (salad or roasted vegetables). I love my smoothies and protein shakes, hummus with raw veggies, avocado toast, keep to a dairy-free except for Greek yogurt, and mostly gluten-free diet, and rarely eat rice except for sushi. I have only drank alcohol once in over a year, and only have non-caffeinated teas and decaf coffee. 

My background: 34F, underwent major surgery in the summer to remove a rapidly growing tumour on my ovary (also lost the ovary). I’ve been going through IVF treatments before and after this surgery with no success in banking eggs for fertility reasons. Though I feel much better than when I first had surgery, I still feel pain especially when expecting a bowel movement or if I’m about to urinate. I feel intense pressure, kind of like cramps. My doctors did tell me that it could be up to a year for the scar tissue to repair itself which could contribute to the pain. Again, it’s not as bad as it once was and I’m starting pelvic floor physiotherapy. My period has been normal and nothing out of the ordinary throughout so I don’t have any concerns. I am unable to exercise like I used to (HIIT and Peloton) and get very easily winded when running. I am also always constantly exhausted or get exhausted easily. I did fertility acupuncture with a clinic for 6 months prior to my surgery who spoke English, but it didn’t make any difference in my IVF results. They were focused on blood flow to the pelvic region. So goes to say, fertility and my slow recovery from surgery was my main reason to seek TCM.

3. Commissions are calculated by this: Sales revenue - overhead rate - direct costs = profit. Commission for sales person generated sales (door knocking etc) paid at 50% of profits. For company provided sales (website or call ins, etc) are paid at 15% or 25% (we haven't decided this number yet.   
\*\*note\*\* Our overhead rate is looking like it is about 15% right now, but I think we will be able to drop that to 10% for Q2 depending on sales. We we will only adjust our overhead rate quarterly for the first two years, then yearly after that.

4. Goal bonus are awarded if you reach your prior month sales goals. 80k in sales revenue = $400 gas card, 120k in sales revenue = $400 gas card + $500.

5. Profit sharing will be considered and calculated each quarter. If the company is profitable, the owners will determine how much can be paid in profit sharing, bonuses will be paid out proportional to sales totals, paid by the end of the month. We will also provide a meal each quarter to disclose the prior quarter financials to the team.

6. Other: Shirts, hoodies, hats, jackets, decals for cars, are provided by the company. Sales people are onsite for installation to provide water, coffee, donuts, pizza whatever to customer & installing team. 

I think that is about the sum total of the policies we are working with so far. We are open to suggestions! We officially started in September, had our first sale in November, and sales #2 & 3 last week, being installed this week. The company is already profitable at this point and we have a number of strong prospects as we are not just chasing insurance, but offering financing and working on getting commercial started in 2026.

I have an autoimmune disease, severe migraines triggered by certain foods and hormones and multiple food allergies and need a suitable coffee creamer substitute as I need to replace my normal dairy one. I am accustomed to the creaminess and neutral flavor of milk based half and half, if that helps.

It needs to just be (preferably) coconut based and preferably JUST coconut or minimal ingredients as possible. It has to be gluten free, free of peanuts, free of OATS (spikes my blood sugar and triggers migraines), free of soy, free of other nuts and seeds, and preferably sugar, sugar substitutes and other additives free.

Ideas I have so far come up with so far: coconut milk from a can (can be hit or miss in terms of texture and taste, but they all seem to contain additives or be lacking in one area or the other) but I am open if you have good recommendations! Dried coconut powder (seems to lack creaminess and taste from reviews but I have never tried, personally) and have also read that MCT oil powder can be good but I have never tried it.

It's more helpful to list specific product name recommendations and your experience with them if possible! And sorry to be so complicated here.

Anyway, my husband and I have been heavily considering EO for a while now. My husband has been studying it for the last two years (he’s more of the brains and I’m more of the spiritual but together we balance each other well). I only became serious about it when I saw that he truly was, about 6-7 months ago. We’ve watched countless videos, even catechumen videos on YouTube, and have been doing the orthodox study Bible readings and prayers. We come from what I would say, a more Protestant background. We both have always felt something was missing in the Protestant church and didn’t agree with a lot of the things they do (and don’t do) etc. 

All this to say, yesterday we went to our first liturgy together (he went once a year ago I stayed home with our newborn), and idk if we built it up to much in our heads or maybe from our Protestant background, but it just felt flat and.. weird? Definitely uncomfortable, but I expected that. It just felt weird for lack of better words. It was a super small place, I’m talking smaller than most people’s kitchen. Everyone was super nice afterwards and interested in our story and came up and introduced themselves and we left while they were starting coffee time and eating. 

We definitely plan to keep going and we know it is a culture shock. But when we read our morning and evening prayers, and watch videos about it and study, we feel so at peace and that it is the true church but then when we went we felt so uneasy? Has anyone else had this experience? 
Like I said, we’re not going to let it scare us away but we both just didn’t expect to feel that way after. I think we thought it was finally solidify that we want to start the catechumen process but we left feeling more confused than when we went in. 

Please pray for our journeys and for peace of mind, let us know if anyone else has felt this way during their process as well. Thank you in advance! ",4,1740415501.0,OrthodoxChristianity,5,0.84,False

Just when I feel like I have a break Easter and Mother’s Day’s are right around the corner. The last couple days were particularly rough very cold, rainy and dreary. Dreary days always make me more depressed bc there’s nothing to do outside and I used to call my mom on those days and talk for hours or go meet her at a cozy coffee shop. Yesterday night was really cold and rainy when the neighbors cat which they left behind when they were evicted, started climbing our screen door. She’s a little skittish, but we’ve been feeding her, so we thought maybe she’s hungry again. She didn’t eat the food though. She then went around and started climbing our window screen in the rain. I opened the door and this time she came running in, she normally doesn’t come in bc she’s wary of us and we have three indoor cats that she growls at from the door. She started rubbing against us and if anyone left the living room she’d follow that person around until they settled back in the living room. She was behaving so oddly I figured she might be in labor, her belly had been growing since she was abandoned. I fixed her a spot in the bathtub and at 4 am I woke up to squeaky meowing. She had three kittens! I woke my kids up in time to watch the birth of number five and they were thrilled. I smiled and felt joy for the first time in a long time. I thanked god even though I don’t know what I’m going to do with all of them but I just know it’s a blessing and my mom is smiling down at us right now. She loved cats and I haven’t had any kittens born since I was little bc we always spay or neuter strays or adopted cats that come our way. I forgot what a joy little squeaky kittens are. Maybe this Mother’s Day won’t be so terrible, I feel like this is a gift from god and my mom bc they knew I needed it. Here’s a picture of the good mama and her babies.

Years ago when I didn’t have steady work, I decided to move 4 hours away and work and live with my aunt and work at her mom n pop restaurant that she owned. It was a small place with about 10 tables. It was often very busy and I often worked 10-13 hour days with little to no break. As a us army veteran, I was trained to be unselfish and that mission always came first. So I treated the restaurant like my unit and pushed myself hard every day for my aunts place. Unfortunately unlike the army, some co workers didn’t rally behind me. In fact, they sought to take advantage of my willingness to work hard. 

My cousin (aunts son) also worked there as a server like me. I worked on a consistent schedule and only took Fridays off. My cousin on the other hand, was a bit more free form and would come into work and take days off at random with little to no warning. He’d often show up hours late and leave early. The only exception to this was Fridays when he knew I wasn’t scheduled to come in. It would be Fridays that he’d actually show up on time and stay until closing because he didn’t want to be hounded by his mom. Of course, he’d do whatever he wanted whenever I was at work cause his mom wouldn’t hound him. Why? Cause I was busting my ass doing the jobs of 2-3 people at times. This went on for several years and I started to grow tired of my cousins constant random work shifts. 

My cousin is a closeted shopaholic and loves to go shopping. Obviously for the many years I was working at the restaurant this meant he couldn’t go out on Black Friday since I was always scheduled off. However, during one particularly busy Thanksgiving weekend, my aunt asked me if I would forgo my one day off and come in on Friday as we were already short staffed. Remembering how busy Thursday was with it just being me, I decide to do the unselfish thing and agree to come in on a Friday. We already had a stacked schedule for Friday with tons of catering orders and a full dining room so I wanted to be a team player. 

Friday morning rolls around and I head into work. My cousin isn’t there yet but about 30 minutes in, I see him pull into the parking lot in his car. As I’m taking the order from a nearby table, I see him walk towards the restaurant, open the door, spots me, stops dead in his tracks, turns around and walks away. I catch this all as I’m taking the tables order. I figured he forgot something out of his car. But a moment later, I see the car leave. Again I figured he forgot something or wants to get a coffee first. 

Well an hour later and he doesn’t come back. And by then the restaurant is at full capacity. I’m frantically running around taking orders, bussing tables, answering phones, running the register, cleaning spills, and preparing drinks all while wondering where he ran off to. 5 hours into my shift and I assume he’s not coming back. I’m wondering if he suddenly got ill. We close at 9 pm and I’m a total wreck. Completely exhausted and sitting down to my first real break of the day. As I’m mopping the floor, who comes in now but my cousin. He brings in tons of bags from different stores and starts bringing out all the crap he bought while out Black Friday shopping. 

“Man there were so many great sales today!” He says as he pulls out a random shirt from H&M. His mom comes out and I think expected her to give him a tongue lashing for not showing up on such a busy day. But instead she starts going through the bags of merchandise and starts to comment on the items completely ignoring the fact that he gave himself the day off and left me to fend of a hellish Friday alone. I felt so dejected. I didn’t take a day off because I was asked to come in to help the very same cousin who was scheduled to work alone. But instead, he saw me at work unexpectedly and decided to take advantage and take the day off. Of course, his mom didn’t complain cause I busted my ass and didn’t take a piss all day to cover his lazy ass. 

I felt angry. But I also felt sad. I felt like I was worthless. I felt like I was only on this earth to make life easier for other people. I felt like I didn’t matter. I had no friends in the area. All I was a server. Someone that people saw when they were hungry. To some, I wasn’t even human. I was a servant. I was scum. I hated this situation and I had enough. I wanted to show my cousin and aunt exactly how they drove me to this with their selfish behavior. So I sent a mass text to 3 friends telling them I was going to k*ll myself. I looked for some bleach in the janitors closet and thought it might be painless if I mixed it with lemonade. I was in tears at home staring at the bottle of bleach and gallon of lemonade I was planning to mix it with. That’s when my friend Deena called me. 

She spent the next 2 hours talking to me and she eventually convinced me to not k*ll myself. Deena also lived about an hour away and said she would personally drive there that night to make sure I didn’t do anything crazy. To this day, I’m thankful for her for saving me that night. 

For the next several months, I started to take better care of myself. I asked for a second day off on my schedule which my cousin naturally hated. He started to complain that I was getting lazy but I also was secretly planning to quit and move back home closer to my mom and sister. One day, I told both my aunt and cousin that I was moving back home but I’d stay on for 2 more months so I can help train a replacement. My cousin, being more pissed that his ticket to an easy job was leaving, told me “why fuckin wait 2 months. If you don’t want to be here, then leave. We don’t need your ass so get the fuck out!”

With that, I packed my bags and moved back home. At first my aunt thought this was just temporary and I was just bowing off some steam. She said I can return to work whenever I’m ready but I took a chance and applied for an engineering job, which was my major in college. I got hired and I’ve been happily working as an engineer now for years. I’m making far more than I ever did at my aunts restaurant and I have way more time off. My cousin had the “you’ll come crawling back attitude” but the restaurant actually closed 2 years ago. My aunt said it was cause she wanted to retire but several regular customers whom I kept in touch with say it was more likely due to business going down after I left as once word got out how poorly they treated me, most people didn’t want to give them their business. 

So here I am today. I haven’t spoken with my cousin since he told me to leave and I don’t know what he does now but I do know that night he ditched work to go Black Friday shopping was a dark time for me but I’m glad I managed to turn it into a positive. If this has taught me anything, it’s that no amount of money is worth your mental health. Yes in the army, we were asked to do some crazy things but the army was a team and I shouldn’t expect civilians to have the same mindset as me. 

I’d love to hear some thoughts and comments about my story and again if anyone is ever having thoughts of “unaliving” themselves then to please seek help. I’m pretty sure at least one person out there cares.

I was about to buy the Brazata Encore ESP when I saw some reviews/comments stating manual grinders would be better if I wanted to keep the same price range. I keep seeing the X Ultra and K Ultra mentioned as really good all around grinders so I figured I come to the experts here and see if I should go manual or stay electric.

Some relevant notes:

\- I make primarily French press. 1-2x a day using a 1L press (so \~50g coffee per single run). So the coarser grind is important and being able to grind a ""larger"" volume of coffee in one go without it taking a really long time or being exhausting.

\- I am looking at buying an espresso machine (probably a Bambino or something similar in that price range) in the next few months and do not want to have to have two grinders. So having the range to go from coarse to really fine is important and the ease of being able to dial between multiple settings without spending a lot of time trying to figure out exactly what the setting was/wasting beans checking would be ideal.

TL;DR: Is there a 1zespresso grinder that is useful in my case or should I stick with electric (at least for the time being)?",1,1740415218.0,1zpresso,1,1.0,False

1ix6cn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1ix6cn7/espresso_training/,Espresso Training,"Hi yall! 

My boss has asked me to make an espresso best practices sheet for our cafe after noticing some habits of my coworkers who haven’t worked specialty before (things like: pulling shots before anything else, using the tamp to settle grounds by hitting the portafilter, not watching shot times, etc). I am absolutely getting an hourly raise as well as paid a bonus for making this sheet. I would love some input from your beautiful barista brains on what you would put in a document like this. 

Some things I would like to include are things like: milk science, shot weight (grounds and completed shots), rag designations and reasons (don’t wipe the counter with a steam rag), a suggested order of operations, level tamping, ice last for cold drinks, mise en place, a couple other things… But I feel like there’s more than that that I’m thinking of when I’m on bar that leaves my brain the second I walk out the door after my shift. 

I would love some insight into what you all would like to see in something like this as well as things you would add into it in this situation. 

For context: we live in a pretty small city where specialty coffee doesn’t *really* exist. So my amazing and talented coworkers have experience and a really solid foundation, but haven’t really had an opportunity to streamline and elevate that skill set. The goal is to uplift them and encourage them while also providing a consistent flow and drink quality. ",5,1740415136.0,barista,6,0.86,False

This visit to Japan cemented the direction my collection is going with urushi pens getting their own drawer (at least). 

The plate in the first slide is from Kiso Artech which is another Kyoto store I highly recommend. My understanding is they are mainly an interiors store with flooring that is to die for. They also have lots of unique urushi dishes that I knew I wanted after my first visit in 2023. 

This visit to Kiso Artech I met @chiro.rumi.coco and she was a wealth of knowledge and kindness, guiding me towards Kyoto experiences I would never have known about otherwise.

Hey there! I’m Danny, a 30-year-old marketing professional who’s equal parts creative, curious, and driven. I’m looking for someone special to share life’s little joys, big adventures, and everything in between. If you love witty banter, deep conversations, and laughing until your cheeks hurt, we might just click.

What It’s Like Dating Me

	•	The Fun Factor: Whether it’s spontaneous road trips, movie marathons, or an absurdly competitive board game night, life with me is never boring.
	•	Master of Chill Plans: I’m just as happy with cozy nights in, great food, and even better company.
	•	Storytime Pro: My life has been full of ridiculous, hilarious, and unforgettable moments—I promise you won’t be bored.
	•	Life’s Little Perks: From finding hidden gems to knowing the best restaurants, I have a knack for making life feel just a little more exciting.
	•	Your Steady Companion: I’m calm under pressure, dependable, and will always have your back (and your favorite snack).

A Bit About Me


I find joy in creativity, adventure, and great storytelling. Whether I’m exploring a new city, diving into an engrossing book, or losing track of time in a deep conversation, I’m always looking to experience life to the fullest.

Travel is a huge part of who I am—I’ve been to Canada, the USA, Colombia, the Bahamas, and Mexico, and I’m far from done. Bonus: I speak Spanish, so we can plan trips to some incredible places!

When I’m not traveling, you’ll find me immersed in art, music, and film. I love discovering new songs, checking out art exhibits, and getting into philosophical debates over coffee. If you appreciate a mix of thoughtful conversation and playful energy, we’ll get along great.

What I’m Looking For


I’m open to meeting women from all walks of life—what matters most is that we bring out the best in each other. Here’s what I value:

	•	Laughter and Fun: A great sense of humor and a willingness to embrace life’s quirks.
	•	Kind and Open-Minded: Someone who’s genuine, grounded, and up for new experiences.
	•	Emotionally Intelligent: Communication, empathy, and loyalty are key to a strong connection.
	•	A Playful Spirit: Life’s too short to take too seriously—let’s have fun!

Why You Should Message Me


If you’re looking for someone who sees life as an adventure, values deep connections, and brings positivity to every moment, I might just be your guy. Whether it’s finding a new favorite spot, enjoying a lazy Sunday morning, or planning a spontaneous getaway, I’m all in for making memories together.

Let’s Make Memories

The best relationships are built on shared experiences, meaningful conversations, and lots of laughter. Whether it’s exploring a quirky art exhibit, hitting the road for a last-minute trip, or staying in for a movie night, I’m looking for someone who’s excited about the journey.

Final Thoughts

Distance isn’t a dealbreaker if we vibe—it’s about building something real. If you’re adventurous, grounded, and ready for a connection that’s both fun and meaningful, let’s chat.

Tell me your favorite travel memory, dream destination, or the last thing that made you laugh—I’d love to hear it.",1,1740414862.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

1ix66vs,https://www.reddit.com/r/firedfeds/comments/1ix66vs/the_purge_doge/,The Purge: DOGE,"*“In a nation obsessed with efficiency, one night a week, the red tape snaps—and the reapers of reform come calling.”*

It began with a tweet. A single, cryptic post from the top: “Big gov bloated. Time to trim fat. DOGE to Mars!” Then the email came. A bland, Arial-font directive from the newly minted Department of Government Efficiency—DOGE—signed with a seal of a guillotine slicing through a W-4. “Waste is the enemy,” it read. “Tonight, we purge.” No one took it seriously at first—another round of cuts, maybe a hiring freeze. But when the clock struck midnight on February 28, 2025, the sirens shrieked across D.C., and the truth sank in: The Purge: DOGE wasn’t a metaphor. It was a reckoning.

The rules were simple, broadcast in a cold, robotic voice: “For the next 12 hours, all federal employment is subject to termination—with extreme prejudice. Efficiency is law. Survival is optional.” The streets erupted in chaos as the DOGE Enforcers—faceless operatives in black suits and mirrored sunglasses—flooded the city. They weren’t auditors with clipboards; they were hunters armed with shredders, tasers, and a mandate to “streamline” the workforce by any means necessary.

In the EPA’s crumbling headquarters, Linda, a water quality specialist, barricaded herself in a supply closet, clutching a flask of Potomac samples. She’d laughed off the rumors—DOGE was just teenagers and Elon, right? Until she saw her supervisor’s head roll past the window, a termination notice stapled to his forehead. Outside, Enforcers chanted their mantra: “Cut the fat, save the nation!” A drone buzzed overhead, its speaker blaring, “Your position has been deemed redundant,” before unloading a hail of pink slips sharp as shrapnel.

Meanwhile, at the IRS, Tom, a tax fraud investigator, fought back. He’d spent decades chasing cheats; now he was the prey. Armed with a chair leg, he took down three Enforcers before they cornered him in the break room. “Numbers don’t lie!” he roared, hurling a laptop as a last act of defiance. But the DOGE commander, a towering figure in a pinstripe exosuit, simply smirked. “Your cost-benefit ratio is negative,” he said, pressing a button that erased Tom’s existence—digital and otherwise—from the system.

The night stretched on, a symphony of screams and shredders. Postal workers fled in mail trucks, only to be run down by DOGE’s fleet of matte-black Cybertrucks. Park rangers hid in the woods, but thermal scanners found them, deeming their bear and fire safety pamphlets “non-essential.” By dawn, the National Mall was a graveyard of cubicles, littered with coffee-stained memos and the husks of pension plans. The Enforcers vanished as the sirens faded, leaving behind a single message etched into the Lincoln Memorial: “DOGE WAS HERE.”

The survivors stumbled into the light, shell-shocked. The news called it “a bold reform,” but the whispers told a darker story. DOGE wasn’t done. Next week, they’d come for the states—DMVs, school boards, anyone with a desk and a paycheck. Efficiency had a price, and it was paid in blood. In this new order, you weren’t a citizen—you were a line item. And the ledger was always balanced.",11,1740414736.0,firedfeds,0,0.72,False

1ix65lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1ix65lk/does_the_best_wireless_earbuds_samsung_galaxy/,Does the best wireless earbuds Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro live up to the hype? A review,"Using the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro over several weeks, I’ve come to appreciate their strengths and notice a few weaknesses. These earbuds are packed with features that cater to tech enthusiasts, but they also have room for improvement. Here’s my take on their performance in daily life.

**Sound Quality & Performance**  
The first time I popped these earbuds in, the sound quality made an immediate impression. The integration of SSC HiFi and UHQ audio codecs ensures a crisp, immersive listening experience. Whether I was streaming music, binging on podcasts, or watching movies, the 24bit/96KHz high-resolution audio delivered with sharp clarity. The bass feels deep without overwhelming other frequencies, and the mids and highs were just as pleasing. I tested the 360 Audio feature with my Galaxy device, and it provided a surround-sound-like experience. However, while this feature shines with Samsung phones, it’s not as dynamic with other brands.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The sleek, compact design caught my eye right away. The silver finish gives a modern touch, but it’s the stemless build that really stands out. The earbuds are lightweight, and despite their plastic material, they feel fairly solid in hand. However, I’ve seen better build quality in competing products. They fit snugly in the ear, but the glossy finish makes them a bit slippery when my hands are sweaty. A small gripe, but worth mentioning.

**Fit & Comfort**  
I spent hours wearing these earbuds, and they’re generally comfortable. The package includes small, medium, and large ear tips, making it easy to find the perfect fit. While they stayed securely in place during workouts, I did experience slight discomfort during extended use. If you have smaller ears, you might find that they press against your ear canal a bit too much.

**Features**  
Samsung packed these buds with features that cater to modern needs. I used the real-time language translation tool while chatting with a Spanish-speaking friend, and it worked surprisingly well. The touch controls are intuitive—tapping to play/pause and swiping to control volume worked like a charm. However, I noticed the touch-sensitive area is a tad too sensitive at times, resulting in accidental commands.

**Durability & Water Resistance**  
With an IPX7 water resistance rating, these earbuds handled my sweaty gym sessions without a problem. One day, I even got caught in a drizzle while jogging, and they performed flawlessly. It’s comforting knowing they can withstand such conditions, but I wouldn’t recommend submerging them in water.

**Noise Cancellation & Ambient Mode**  
The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is impressive. It blocks out a significant amount of background noise, whether it’s the hum of an air conditioner or chatter in a coffee shop. I found the Ambient Mode handy when walking outdoors since it allowed me to stay aware of my surroundings. That said, I did notice a faint hissing sound in one earbud while using ANC in very quiet environments, which can be slightly annoying.

**Battery Life & Charging**  
Battery life is a mixed bag. With ANC enabled, I got about 5-6 hours of continuous use, and the charging case extended it to roughly 18 hours. The fast-charging feature is a lifesaver when you’re in a pinch—10 minutes of charging gave me over an hour of playtime. However, battery life could be better, especially compared to some competitors that last longer on a single charge.

**Warranty**  
The international model doesn’t come with a domestic warranty, which could be a concern for some. I’ve had no issues so far, but it’s something to keep in mind if you prefer having a safety net.

**Advantages**

* Immersive sound quality with hi-fi audio codecs
* Comfortable fit with multiple ear tip sizes
* Effective ANC and responsive Ambient Mode
* Water-resistant design for outdoor and gym use

**Drawbacks**

* Slight hissing noise with ANC in silent settings
* Build quality feels a bit cheap for the price
* Limited battery life compared to other premium earbuds

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing these to the Sony WF-1000XM5, I’d say the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro has better integration with Samsung devices, especially with the Galaxy-exclusive features. However, Sony’s earbuds offer superior noise cancellation and a more polished design. Apple’s AirPods Pro 2 also compete closely, delivering exceptional seamlessness within the Apple ecosystem, though they fall short in water resistance compared to Samsung’s offering.

**True Value**  
Given the features and sound quality, these earbuds offer great value, especially for Samsung users who can unlock their full potential. If you’re outside the Samsung ecosystem, you might not get the same level of functionality, which could make pricier competitors more appealing.

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

If marathon work sessions leave you dragging your feet, here’s something that could totally change the game: microbreaks! 🕒✨

Imagine this: instead of forcing yourself through endless hours at your desk, you *actually* take tiny pauses—not your average coffee runs, but intentional breaks that revitalize your mind and body. Sounds dreamy, right?

**Here’s why microbreaks are your new best friend:**

- **Boost Creativity and Focus:** Just a **60-second dance-off** in your living room can shake up those brain cells. I mean, who doesn’t want some Beyoncé vibes midday? 💃🕺

- **Reduce Stress:** Those quick mental vacations, like a minute of deep breathing or that stretch you’ve neglected (yeah, I’m talking to you, your tight shoulders), can bring down that cortisol like magic.

- **Improve Physical Health:** Your body will thank you for these mini pauses. Seriously, stretch those legs! A little movement ensures you’re not morphing into a pretzel by day’s end.

- **Restore Motivation:** Sometimes, all it takes is stepping away for a breath of fresh air to come back with more ideas than there are Marvel movies. So step outside, inhale that fresh air, and *wow*, you’re practically a new person!

**Wondering how to squeeze these in without disrupting your flow? Here’s what works for me:**

1. **Set a Timer**: Every 25 minutes, the alarm nudges me, “Time to get up!” It’s my friendly reminder to step away before I’m glued to the chair. 📱

2. **Micro Activities:** Grab a glass of water, do some jumping jacks, or check in with a coworker or friend for a quick laugh. It’s amazing how a little human interaction can lift your spirits.

3. **Mindfulness Minute**: Close your eyes and just breathe. Focusing on your breath for a minute can reset your brain and clear away that mental clutter.

Remember, we’re not machines. We’re human beings with energy limits. These tiny breaks aren’t just pauses; they’re power-ups! 💡

So, next time you catch yourself bulldozing through your tasks like it’s all or nothing, try carving out some time for microbreaks. They might just be the secret sauce you didn’t know your day needed.

-horror movies, comedies, action, fantasy etc. 
- discover new cuisines, coffee shops or cute bakeries etc 
-playing Pokémon go (usually do that with my partner but I'd love to play with friends as well) 
- I play video games here and there when I can. Mostly story driven games. I'm soulsborne player, love those games.

1ix60kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/campfirecreeps/comments/1ix60kr/ooze_of_the_heart_pt_1/,Ooze of the Heart (pt 1),"""Cupid? And that's your real name?"" Hedge Rayland asked his newest patient, Devlin Cupid, a newly married man age 24, Tall, Average build, curly red hair, and seeking help with self-control. At least that's what it said on his patient application form he filled out a week prior.

Chuckling Devlin responded ""Yeah, it's real. I get that a lot. People just think I'm messing with em' given the hair and all."" He looked down at the oak coffee table at a half-drank cup of coffee that separated the two men as he finished his sentence.

Dr. Rayland's office had a warm venerable aspect to it, from the Victorian-style furniture to the posh lighting fixtures adorning the burgundy and emerald walls. Seeming out of time for the modern 1980s world they lived in. Rayland looked a man far out of his own age, only 33 he carried himself very properly with combed-back brown hair and a tidy mustache, a vest with a black blazer and an antique pipe he would puff on occasionally throughout his appointments. However the addition of Rayland's light Bostonian accent made for a contrasting persona, the voice not matching the face and all that. Devlin didn't quite know what to make of the man. 

""A fine name son, no worries of it, now what I like to do for first appointments is break the ice a little. I tell you something about me, you tell me something about you, so on and so forth. For instance, crosswords, I adore a good crossword in the morning, really gets the brain moving, y'know what I mean?"" Hedge said, giving Devlin a calming gaze, sitting in anticipation. 

Nothing, Devlin just sat there giving a blank-faced open mouth stare at the Dr.

With a wide-eyed grimace, Rayland leaned forward and gave a gesture of ""Okay now you go"" 

The red haired man's gears finally started cranking as he fumbled with his words ""Oh ugh yeah, I ugh, football, I like watching football"" 

""Ah, football very nice! A big sports fan!"" Rayland exclaimed, internally thinking ""Wow this guy is the real deal, a true bonafide dullard""

""Okay so you're a sports guy, I'm a words guy. How about you tell me what you do for work?"" Rayland inquired not wanting to drag this appointment out longer than he needed.

""I work down at Hemms, you know the chemical disposal plant near the Commonwealth flats, I ugh. Well you know I take out the old barrels and ugh. I put em in the trucks and the guys, they ugh they take em away."" Devlin stuttered out

""Oh disposal work, keeping the earth clean, very noble work my friend"" Rayland kept a very professional front but could not get this over with faster, he had spent the night prior with a slim, dark hair 25 year old he met down at Muse. Up until 3am, barely a drop of sleep and a hangover that could put a bear into early hibernation.

Wanting to get on with the appointment Rayland asks ""So I see you're having issues with impulse control? What exactly are these impulses of yours?""

Nervously Devlin responds ""Well you see doc, I ugh. Now haha now this is gonna sound just so out there, but it's about my ugh. My wife ya see."" Devlin pauses

""Your wife? Is there some kind of overzealousness you have with your wife in a sexual manner? You know that's pretty normal for newlyweds Mr. Cupid."" Rayland rebutted 

""Oh no no haha no it's nothing like that at all doc, I ugh ha we don't exactly do that"" visible uncomfortable Devlin adjusts himself in his chair.

""Hmm okay well what is it then?"" Rayland becoming more impatient with every interaction with Devlin and he fears his frustration is starting to show.

""Well you see, I want to kill my wife."" Devlin stated in a cool and collected time ""I want to cut her open and pull her heart right out of her chest."" The man's tone changed on a dime.

A chill runs up Rayland's spine as he stares at the coffee cup in front of him, wide-eyed, not quite sure if he should make eye contact, he just lets Devlin continue.

""I just love her so much doctor, I can't stand to see anyone even look at her, I want to take her away from this gawking world. Take her heart and put it in my pocket."" Devlin says, grasping at something invisible with his hand.

Finally looking up to the man Rayland finds his cold gray eyes staring directly at him. Another chill runs up his spine and into his head, rattling his brain with a shiver. A primeval desire to get the hell out of this room right now almost overtakes him. 

""N-now, why would you want to go and do that, Devlin?"" Stammered Rayland.

""Mr. Cupid if you don't mind, doctor."" Devlin stated plainly

""Oh, ugh, of course, sorry Mr. Cupid."" it seemed Rayland had the roles reversed on him and he felt like the scared bumbling idiot now. 

""Didn't you hear me before doctor? I love her."" A smirk crept up on Devlin's face as he spoke.

""That's what I'm not understanding here. Mr. Cupid, if you loved her, well why on earth would you want to take her life?"" Questioned Rayland.

""Wouldn't you do anything for the ones you love, doctor? She made vows to me, not to this vile world, not to these sick people. To me. I need to take her away from it all before it's too late.""
Again another overwhelming urge to flee washed over Rayland, fighting it back with all his will he sat planted and tried to keep his composure.

""But, why tell me any of this?"" Not knowing if he wanted the answer to that question or not

""Well, cause you killed your wife too, Dr. Wayland. Isn't that right?"" Asked Devlin ""You smothered her to death in her sleep, you're just like me"" giving a devilish grin.

""DONG"" The antique clock rang off signaling an end to the appointment.

""Well, that's our time!"" Rayland shot up and quickly hurried to rush Devlin out of the door.

""Oh, uh, oh already doc?"" Devlin's previous demeanor returned as the act of Rayland grabbing and rushing the man out.

""I am afraid so lad, all the time we have today"" hastened Rayland. 

""Oh uh, okay doc I uh I guess same time next week huh?"" Asked Devlin.

""Yes yes lad, same time, best be off now."" Rayland rushed 

""Okay bye d...."" Rayland slammed the door on Devlin before he could finish his sentence.

Turning quick the doctor rushed over to his cupboard and poured a stiff glass of gin, dowing the floral liquor Rayland took a deep gasping breath ""Fucking madman, crazy fucking psychotic madman!"" 

""You smothered your wife in her sleep."" The words rang in his mind. 
""Did I hear him right? Rayland? No Wayland!"" Rayland shouted. ""He got me confused for Duluth Wayland!"" Another practicing therapist Wayland had been in the news recently but only by name. Remembering the still active case from earlier in the year, the police suspected murder and Wayland was high up in the list of possible suspects.  

""I just got roped into some maniac's murderous delusion over mistaken identity!!!"" Rayland bent over with the anticipation of vomiting. 

""BZZZZZ!!"" The buzzer to Rayland's office went off and the door swung open, Chelsea Valenta, Rayland's 24 year old receptionist. Chelsea had been working for Rayland for the better part of three years now screening clients and collecting payments. She came marching in over to Rayland with a deeply concerned look on her pale face, her blue eyes peeking through her soft blonde hair with worry. 

""Okay that guy, what the hell is up with him? He just walked past and gave me the craziest stare down I've ever seen."" She said in a whispered yell.

""I need you to get the police on the line now, that guy can't be allowed to go home to his wife."" Rayland said, adjusting his coat in an attempt to compose himself. 

________________________________________________

""His wife?"" The Boston police officer asked 

""Yes, he said he wanted to cut her open!  I really don't think we should take a chance with this guy."" Rayland said as he poured himself another glass of gin

""And he just up and told you all this, for no reason?"" Questioned the officer 

""No, I think he thought I was Duluth Wayland, similar names, same job. I think he just got me confused with that guy and he thought I would relate to him?"" Rayland knew how it sounded and could tell he wasn't exactly getting through to the cop in front of him.

""Look, can you just go and check up on him? Make sure nothing is going on?"" Rayland pleaded 

""As soon as you called in we went to the guy's apartment but no one was home, we'll try his work tomorrow to see if we can catch him there and take him in for evaluation. You said the Hemms plant right?"" The officer gave a reassuring gesture to the disheveled man.

""Yes that's correct, just please find this guy. In all my years I've never seen a man so resolute in his own bullshit."" Rayland said, speaking through lighting his pipe.

""We'll be on it, Doc. I promise. Look you've had a rough day, just go home and try to get some rest, we'll keep you updated okay?"" The cop put his coat back on and slipped out of the office. 

""Yes, very good, thank you officer. I'll be hearing from you"" Rayland waved the cop off and closed up his office for the night. Laying in bed after nearly a whole bottle of 80 proof gin, Rayland tossed and turned trying to get some shut eye but knew none would come to him this night, or any night soon. His hands trembled by the day's happenings and opted to do some late night reading. He decided to finally finish off Lightning by Dean Koontz, he'd been a sucker for a good horror novel since he was a boy growing up in midtown. They had an oddly soothing effect on him, often sending him off to his own dream world before he could finish a chapter. Tonight was no different, a mere 10 words away from the chapter's end Hedge Rayland was in a restless slumber.

1ix5za5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ix5za5/noob_story_about_best_and_worst_espresso_shot/,Noob story about best and worst espresso shot,"Hi everyone, I've just started my espresso journey so wanted to share my experience. I also have one general coffee question in the end.

I tried moka pot, filter coffee with Chemex, Nespresso capsule machine and I was always unhappy with how my coffee tastes.  
So I recently started looking into espresso machines. I quickly realized it could quickly become a rabbit hole and I really didn't want another hobby (I have the same inner struggle with everything). Finally decided to go with the Ninja Luxe machine since I found in reviews that it can produce decent results with a reasonable amount of involvement.

1. I've started with medium roast controlled origin. Succeed to dial in 1:2 18g->36g, 25-35 seconds. Right after brewed, acidity was a little higher than I like it, but after it cooled down it was great!
2. Then I decided to try cheaper coffee and bought Lavazza Rosa. I brewed it the same way as I did the previous coffee. Well, that was the worst cup of coffee in my entire life! I had burnt wood aftertaste in my mouth the rest of the day! I haven't given up yet... I recall that I've raised temp to Hi setting for previous coffee because it was a lighter roast in an attempt to lower acidity. When I put it to Med it was already much better but still too bitter. (also couldn't get consistent brew times probably because of channeling issues) Then I found that the puck screen could improve even extraction, after I added it was even better,... long story short - then I also added a paper filter on the bottom of the portafilter, and a shot exit 18:36, for 30 sec... and oh my god! This was the BEST espresso cup of coffee I've ever tried in my life! It was so good I didn't want to pollute it with milk. So I guess this is my educational tale - There is a very small step between the worst and best cup of coffee! Even on almost automatic machine there is a lot that can be done to improve. I also order WDT tool but it didn't arrive yet. (About my hobby issues - I already spent the weekend designing and printing a puck stand and box for coffee filters with cap for perforating circle for bottom of my portafilter since there was no suitable paper size in the store so I need to trim it down to the right size ...)

Noob question: I notice that, controlled origin arabica coffee I tried so far have higher acidity right after brewed, but as it gets cooled down, the taste is becoming more and more balanced, and fully cooled it is the best in my opinion.  
On the other hand this Lavazza Rosa has the most balanced taste right after it is brewed - so while it is hot. When it cools down it gets more bitter. My question is why is this happening? Is this maybe caused by the robusta mix in Lavazza Rosa? Or darker roast?",1,1740414216.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1ix5yy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1ix5yy9/the_habit_loop_understand_it_to_break_bad_habits/,The Habit Loop: Understand It to Break Bad Habits for Good,"**Hey folks! 🌀 Ever find yourself stuck in a loop you can’t break free from?** You know the one—I’m talking about those pesky habits that sneak up on you like an unexpected email on a Friday afternoon. We've all been there, wrestling with the habit loop, but I’ve got some insights today that might just *free* you once and for all.

**First off, what even is the Habit Loop?** Picture it like a never-ending merry-go-round with three main components: *Cue, Routine,* and *Reward.* 😮🎠

1. **Cue:** This is the trigger that sets everything into motion. Maybe it’s that clock hitting 3 PM and suddenly, *bingo*, your brain screams ""coffee break!"" 
   
2. **Routine:** This is the habit itself. No judgment here, but maybe it’s the afternoon coffee or that cheeky chocolate bar because, you know, life’s short.

3. **Reward:** Ah, the sweet dopamine rush! It’s what keeps you coming back for more. It could be that jolt of energy, the comfort of a little treat, or just the pleasure of stepping away from your desk for a moment. 😊

**So how do we break free?** It's like trying to leave a party before your favorite song comes on—not easy, but totally doable!

- **Identify the Culprit:** Next time you find yourself reaching for that snack or scrolling mindlessly, pause for a sec. What was your cue? Keep a little journal—*yes, those still exist*—and jot down the trigger.
  
- **Mix Up Your Routine:** Once you’ve got the cue nailed down, experiment with replacing the routine. Instead of a snack, try a brisk walk or a quick catch-up with a friend. Your initial habit might throw a tantrum, but you’ll be dancing to a whole new groove before you know it.

- **Choose a Better Reward:** Can you reward yourself differently? If your habit is about taking breaks, maybe the reward becomes a quick meditation or just basking in the glory of completing a task. 🌟

**But hang tight!** Breaking habits isn’t as easy as breaking a pencil. It takes time and a bit of self-love, like learning to whistle while trying not to drool on your chin. 🤭

Would love to hear how you guys tackle your habit loops or any small victories you've had! Got any bizarre cues or rewards that keep life interesting?

Remember, we’re all in this together, one loop, one hilarious misstep at a time. Keep pushing forward, and let’s ride this merry-go-round to somewhere amazing! 🎡✨",1,1740414193.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1ix5yc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/1ix5yc6/trip_report_ponce/,Trip Report - Ponce,"Hi all, I just spent five days in Ponce (it was supposed to be three in Ponce and three in Boqueron but the hotel in Boqueron sucked, lol) and thought I'd report back here, as there's not much info on this sub about Ponce and much of it is outdated.

  
**Overview**

Ponce is one of the largest cities in Puerto Rico and also one of the most historically significant. During the Spanish colonial era, Ponce was the wealthiest and most important city on the island. After the US invaded, Ponce began a slow decline for many reasons - natural disasters, closure of certain markets, agricultural consolidation, the movement of capital and jobs to San Juan, US repression of the Nationalist movement, and more. The end result is a city that looks and feels like it was rich and important in the past, but is no longer, similar to many towns in Europe that were trading or commerce hubs at one point and then faded.

Most of the information on this sub regarding Ponce suggests that it's not worth seeing or that there's not much worth seeing because the 2020 earthquake devastated everything. That's not totally wrong--many of the museums have closed or have very limited hours, for instance, the most egregious example being the Ponce Massacre Museum being in total disrepair (likely because the Ponce Massacre is not the sort of history that people with money and power want to remember)--but it's not the whole story, and I think it does a disservice to a pleasant, charming city, albeit one that is still struggling to get back on its feet. Ponce wouldn't be the place I would prioritize on a first or even a second trip to Puerto Rico, but if you, like me, have been to the island a few times and want a new perspective, it's a great spot in its own right and a good home base for southern Puerto Rico.

I stayed as long as I did in part because I'm currently traveling while working remotely; I've been in Puerto Rico for three weeks, most of it in Vieques and San Juan. I stayed Tuesday to Friday and worked during the day, and stayed Saturday to Monday without working. Were I not working, I think a full weekend - Friday night through Monday morning - would be an ideal amount of time to spend in the city.

  
**Accommodation**

I stayed at the Ponce Plaza Hotel and Casino, which seemed to be consistently the highest-rated hotel in the city itself. The hotel is clean and comfortable, reasonably priced, and staff are friendly. I only had two issues: First, in the ""new building"" where most of the rooms are located, first-floor rooms are only about eight feet above the road level, meaning that you can hear traffic noise in the room, particularly during the morning rush hour. Second, in the second room I stayed in (Room 102, the accessible room, which was the only one left when I booked last minute to get out of my crappy Boqueron hotel) seems to be between two internet repeaters, so the wifi doesn't work very well and I've spent this morning working from the hotel's cafe. I otherwise liked the hotel quite a bit; I would recommend calling when you book to request an upper-floor room, and avoiding the accessible room unless you have a need for it. The casino, like most small casinos, is pretty much just depressing--a bunch of older people pressing buttons that make their savings disappear--but I did win $80 when I played a slot on a whim, so YMMV.

  
**Activities**

In addition to just sort of wandering, I did the following activities during my stay:

\* A walking tour booked through Airbnb Experiences (title is ""Explore Ponce's historic neighborhood,"" host is Melina). This was an excellent tour. The guide took us around the historic downtown, pointed out some of the significant architecture, talked about Ponce's history and culture, took us to the cultural center, and offered recommendations about the city. It's a good way to get oriented and I really enjoyed it.

\* Don Q rum tour at Castillo Serrales. I'd say this is the second-best rum-related activity on the island (behind the Ron del Barrilito distillery tour and tasting, and well ahead of Bacardi). Like many such tours, it's in part an ad for the rum brand, but it's in a neat mansion, you get to taste rum straight from the cask and make a couple other drinks, and there are great views from the mansion and gardens.

\* Cabo Rojo Las Salinas Interpretive Center and Faro Los Morrillos lighthouse. I'm a bird guy and this was a great place to see birds. In a few hours of hiking, I saw a mangrove cuckoo, a grassquit, a Puerto Rican mango, a Venezuelan troupial, a Puerto Rican flycatcher, and various terns, frigatebirds, and egrets. It's also just a lovely area. Be warned that it gets very hot and shade is limited so bring water and sunscreen. 

\* Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center. The ruins aren't massive, but it's still cool to see some of the earliest man-made objects in the Caribbean. The interpretive center has some good artifacts and explanations. 

\* ""Yaucromatic."" This is a neat street art installation (or series of installations) in Yauco. I wouldn't go way out of my way to see it, but it's an easy stop if you're heading west and worth a look.

\* Guanica State Forest. Good hiking trails and nice views. For a good hour-ish hike I'd recommend parking at the visitors center (Google Maps destination point) and walking out the Lluveras trail to the El Vigia viewpoint, then back on the Granados trail. Fewer birds but a pleasant walk; if you're familiar with hiking in the Western US, this will feel similar, as the vegetation and climate is a lot like southern California or the Salt Lake foothills. Again, bring water and sunscreen.

\* Sunday night concert. Every Sunday for over 125 years, the Ponce Municipal Band has put on a free open-air concert in the Plaza Las Delicias, either in front of the city hall or the Parque de Bombas. Locals bring folding chairs and refreshments. It's a lovely time.

\*La Guancha. The boardwalk area still hasn't been rebuilt since the earthquakes, so it's basically a strip of fried food and beer places and a waterfront park. Not a great beach--a small strip of sand and lots of sea grass--but a nice park area with lots of shady spots for picnics. More like a beach at Lake Tahoe than what you think of as a Caribbean beach.

  
**Restaurants and Nightlife**

Many of the posts about Ponce emphasize that the nightlife here is not comparable to San Juan. That's 100% true. However, I'm more of a ""sit in a quiet bar and read"" kind of guy than a ""dance till 4 AM"" kind of guy, so it wasn't a problem for me. There are some nightclubs on Friday and Saturday on Calle Atocha; I can't speak to how good they are in part because I don't know much about clubs and in part because the crowd going in and out appeared to be in their late teens and early 20s and I figured a 37-year-old nerd would probably kill the vibe. Places I did go:

\* Vistas. Food and drinks are decent, but the real draw is the view. The patio fills up around sunset for good reason; it's a lovely place to sit.

\*Velada Jazz Bar. Good food and excellent cocktails. I went on a Thursday and it was pretty dead, but on Saturday I went again and there was live jazz and a great vibe.

\*Diverso. Fine dining restaurant near the plaza. I got croquettes and sea bass; the croquettes were good but not great, but the sea bass was maybe the best fish I've had in PR so far, and I've eaten a LOT of fish over the last few weeks.

\*Papa Rupe Brewing Co. Craft beers on tap (both house beers and other PR microbrews) and smash burgers. Everything I had here was good, the one house beer they had on tap (Finca El Frio) was my favorite. Chill vibes also.

\* Gallo Espresso. Breakfast and lunch place on the plaza. Food and coffee were quite good, but when it gets crowded service is insanely slow. I went on Sunday at 10ish AM, there was a long line, and it took me 45 minutes to get my breakfast burrito. When I went on Monday at 8:30 it was much more reasonable, probably a ten-minute wait from ordering to eating.

\* King's Cream. Ice cream place on the plaza. Delicious. Highly recommend the guanabana (soursop) ice cream.

\* Lola Eclectic Cuisine. The house restaurant for Ponce Plaza Hotel. A perfectly adequate hotel restaurant. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if you can't get in at Velada or Diverso and you're not in the mood for burgers it's solid. Good cocktails too.

\*Melao. House cafe for Ponce Plaza Hotel. If you get a room which has breakfast and coffee included, it's worth eating; otherwise the only reason to come here is for the wifi.

**Practical Tips**

\* You'll want to have a car. Many of the activities are driving distance and there's not really any public transit. Cabs and Ubers are available but can be hit or miss--I was totally unable to get an Uber up to Castillo Serrales for my tour but luckily happened to see a cab drive by, but on the way back I got an Uber in 5 minutes. I'm normally a walk everywhere kind of guy, but between the heat and the distance (as well as the occasional pack of stray dogs) I wouldn't recommend walking outside of the historic city center.

\* Most people who work in the service industry speak at least some English, but it's less of a guarantee than in San Juan. I speak a bit of Spanish and got around fine.

\*Some of the roads in the forest or nature reserves are a bit rough. That said, I have a two-wheel drive sedan and was fine.

**Suggested Itinerary**

If I were visiting just to do tourism and not working part of the day, I'd go for a full weekend (Friday night - Sunday morning) and go roughly as follows:

Friday night: Drive down from San Juan, stop at Lechonera Los Pinos in Cayey. Check in to PPHC, go to Vistas for happy hour cocktails at the sunset, then go to Papa Rupe for beers and burgers.

Saturday: Breakfast at Gallo Espresso if you get up early or Melao if you get it free with your room. Take the walking tour at 10:30. Go to the Don Q rum tour at 1 (for English) or 3:30 (for Spanish). Check out the gardens, have an extra drink there if you're so inclined, then either go to La Guancha if you're feeling like a little fried food pick-me-up and a walk, or take a nap. Later in the evening, go to Velada for drinks and dinner.

Sunday: Same breakfast plan, then go out on an excursion - Las Salinas if you're into birds, Guanica State Forest if you want to hike, Hacienda Buena Vista if you are interested in coffee or colonial history (I didn't go but I hear good things), Tibes if you're interested in indigenous history, or one of the beaches near Cabo Rojo if that's your vibe. Most people will be able to do at least a couple of these in a full day, plus a stop at Yaucromatic. Personally, if I come back I'll probably go back to Las Salinas and then check out Hacienda Buena Vista in the afternoon. When you get back, shower then go get some ice cream at King's Cream and listen to the Municipal Band in the Plaza (starts around 6), then go to Diverso for dinner.
