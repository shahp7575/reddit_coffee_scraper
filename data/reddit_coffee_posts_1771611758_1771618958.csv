Do I need to do more?,"I (20f) have had a class last and this semester with a guy (21m). We’ve bantered a LOT in class and I decided to make my move on him, but I don’t know if he understood. For context, I’ve only been with women and so I don’t really know how to navigate men romantically, and all my friends are gay or girls, so I need an objective opinion of what I should do. I asked him after class if he would ever want to get coffee, and he said “I’m going to get coffee after class, you can join me.” We went and had coffee, continuing the banter. He had a class 30 minutes later, so he had to leave quickly. He hasn’t made any contact since (it’s only been a day but still) and I’m not sure if he actually understood that I was asking him in a romantic context. Do I need to do a more direct way of it? Or was he just being nice and it was a friend thing. He didn’t pay for my coffee, but he did hold a door open for me. I’ve seen him on dating apps, so I know he’s single.

Lately I’ve realised how easy it is to get stuck in the same routine and social circle, so I’m hoping to meet some new people around me who are open to building real, lasting connections.
I enjoy going out for walks, random late-night conversations, or just stepping out for a smoke and unwinding after a long day. I’m also into music, films and creative projects

Ideally looking for people nearby who’d be down to hang out sometime go on walks, grab chai/coffee, or just vibe. Totally open to starting online and seeing where it goes.

1ra4ejr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1ra4ejr/recently_single_after_2year_relationship_ended/,"Recently single after 2-year relationship ended – struggling with moving on, looking for guys' real advice on getting back out there","Hey everyone. I'm 24M and my ex (23F) and I were together for about 2 years. We met through mutual friends in college. We clicked right away and things were pretty great for the first year and a half. We shared hobbies, trips, met each other's families and talked about the future. But over the last few months she started distancing herself. She said she felt like she was growing in different directions. No major drama or cheating as far as I know. She just said her feelings had changed and it wasn't fair to stay if she wasn't all in. We broke up amicably but it's been a rough few weeks for me. I miss the connection. I keep second guessing what went wrong and nights are the worst when everything feels quiet.  
  
I've been trying the standard stuff. Gym, friends, hobbies. It's helping a bit during the day but the emotional side still hits hard. From talking to buddies who've been through breakups and from my own past shorter ones I've been thinking about ways to actually move forward instead of just waiting for time to fix it.  
  
One thing that's helped before is shifting perspective. Reminding myself there are tons of people out there who could be a great fit. Maybe even better in some ways. It's easy to idealize what we had but it wasn't perfect and focusing on that helps me feel less stuck.  
  
The approach I'm leaning toward now is getting back into dating sooner rather than later to help rebuild that sense of connection with someone new. Self improvement is important but in the past just grinding solo didn't fully let the feelings fade. I'd stay busy then crash. So this time I'm planning to be more proactive with meeting people.  
  
I'm starting with dating apps and committing to swiping around 100 times a day to get some momentum. It feels basic but putting real effort into photos (clear good lighting showing who I am and what I like doing) and profile seems to make a difference. As a guy I know it's more competitive so I've asked female friends for feedback and checked out Tinder from a girl's perspective stuff online. A lot of profiles out there are basic so improving mine gives an edge. I even looked for celebs with a similar vibe to mine and took inspiration from their clean confident photos to level up mine without copying exactly. Got premium on the main ones (Hinge Tinder Bumble) for better visibility and I do my swipes first thing in the morning as a routine.  
  
When matches happen I keep openers simple. A hey or quick comment on something in their profile. Nothing over the top. Then chat normally and set up low key dates. Coffee if it's cool out or ice cream when it's nice. Keeps it relaxed cheap no big expectations and lets things flow naturally without pressure.  
  
I'm hoping this helps shift my focus outward and makes the past feel less heavy. In the past consistent dates helped me move on quicker and feel excited again.

University life isn’t lived only in lecture halls.

It’s lived in the spaces in between.

For me, that includes morning walks through Pelaw Woods, spontaneous pancake stops after lectures, and quiet café corners where deadlines somehow feel manageable.

# Pelaw Woods: Reset Space

There’s something grounding about green space during university life.

Walking through Pelaw Woods before exams clears mental clutter. The calm helps when assignments feel overwhelming. It’s a reminder that productivity doesn’t always come from sitting longer at a desk — sometimes it comes from stepping away.

Living close enough to campus to reach places like this easily makes exploration part of routine rather than a planned event.

# Pancake Breaks

There’s always that one café you associate with comfort.

For me, it’s the pancake spot that becomes:

* Post-exam celebration venue.
* Sunday brunch location.
* Catch-up space with friends.

These small rituals create emotional stability.

When your accommodation is well-connected to campus and city spots, you’re more likely to explore without overthinking transport or time.

# Productivity Corners

Some cafés feel like unofficial study hubs. Background noise, coffee refills, and shared focus energy.

But the ability to step out and return quickly matters. Living nearby means you can experiment with different productivity environments without losing hours commuting.

# Why Location Shapes Lifestyle

Accommodation location doesn’t just affect convenience. It shapes your daily experience.

When everything feels accessible — campus, green spaces, cafés — university life feels balanced rather than rushed.",1,1771614468.0,u_Low-Astronaut3147,0,1.0,False

1ra4cir,https://www.reddit.com/r/askAGP/comments/1ra4cir/is_agp_always_rooted_in_sexual_desirefetish/,Is AGP always rooted in sexual desire/fetish?,"I'm a person in their early 20s questioning their gender and until now I exclusively interacted with the trans subs/egg narrative. Yesterday I started exploring the ""other"" side and came across [this article](https://sillyolme.wordpress.com/2014/02/14/a-clinical-view/). What caught my eye was what it lists under group 3.

*""Group Three (G3) is composed of natal males who identify as female but who act and appear normally male.
///
To add to their confusion, and counter to behavior typically reported in openly gender dysphoric boys, many cloistered boys actually preferred solo play with boys’ toys and had little or no interest in girls’ toys. For example I have heard more than one long-time post-op male-to-female transsexual speak fondly of having spent countless hours playing with an Erector Set or a Lionel model train set-up that their father had helped them build. Others described of designing and making detailed model airplanes, race cars and sailing ships. The more academic of this group report little or no interest in sports and rough and tumble play. To avoid castigation from their peers, they report spending a lot of time reading and studying.""*

I absolutely relate to this. I don't have the ""female core"". I appear as a cis, straight man. I've had a relatively normal childhood, I played with lego, toy trains, toy planes, marble runs, technical toys with lots of moving parts etc. I didn't ever like guns though and I hated sports. I cannot catch a ball to this day. I did to theatre and music but I wasn't ever seen as gay/feminine, just a bit different I guess. I had both male and female friends throughout my childhood but I didn't ever truly fit in with either group which became more apparent around the age of 14 when basically all of my friends got in other friend groups but I didn't manage to find a new crowd to this day. I have people I can go grab a coffee with once a month or so, but that's it. No close friends.

So, I fit the G3/AGP narrative pretty well. Except that there's one problem: I don't have sexual fantasies about me in a women's body. I don't even think about the sexual aspect when questioning my gender. I have only crossdressed a few times and never got aroused from that.

I have secretly wished I were a girl years before puberty started and after it did and I started socialising mainly with girls, I was sad I'll never be able to have the same level of connection as they had between themselves. I never felt or acted as one of the girls, I was just a normal acting male who hung out with them. I kind of envied feminine gays who were able to be fully included in female friend groups. I didn't actively question my gender until much later (a few months ago, really) - but if you offered me the magic button I'd still press it when I was about 6 years old. Girls were prettier and cooler after all.

Now, sexual desire: up till I was 15 or so, I thought I was straight. Then I realised that I was romantically exclusively attracted to feminine-presenting individuals, but sexually to men as well. Maybe even more than women. Some might call it a psuedo-bisexuality, but there's a small problem, again: I started experiencing this way before I questioned my gender.
I don't think I experience attraction the same way most cis men do though: while I might notice a pretty girl and fantasise about hugging/kissing her, I never fantasise about sexual intercourse. The sexual attraction is just not there when I see or interact with anyone, really. But I still do have sexual desires, they just seem to be separate from romantic ones. Interestingly, I always hated the fact that the man must assume the active role during sex. Looking back, it's just a continuation of something I felt earlier: when I was a kid and my parents first explained where babies came from, I was disappointed when I learnt how small the role of a man is when conceiving a child and kind of envied women for the ability to have children. Maybe this was simply [womb envy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Womb_envy), I don't know. It's funny that I cared about this as a kid since later, as a teen, I realised I didn't want children, something I still stand firmly behind, to the disappointment of my parents.
It'd probably be good to mention that I have never been in a romantic relationship with a person of any gender. Ever since my mid teens, I've had problems forming connections, be it platonic or romantic. I think I might have an anxious-avoidant attachment style.

In the last few years I've also been dealing with pretty severe brain fog and derealisation. I never feel present and am disconnected from the world around me (which makes forming relationships even harder as I appear distant to people) but don't exhibit any other dissociative symptoms. This could be gender dysphoria or any number of other undiagnosed mental health conditions.

Now, the possibility of being trans: as stated, I'd prefer to have been born a girl. I do experience various forms of dysphoria but at the same time I don't think I could ever feel like a woman. If I tried transitioning, I'm pretty sure I'd be experiencing anxiety 24/7 as being a woman would never feel natural for me. Again, I don't have that ""gay/female core.""

So, is this just a manifestation of symptoms that has the same result as AGP, but different origins? Or what? I'll appreciate any insight.",6,1771614361.0,askAGP,3,1.0,False

I asked ""Am I the asshole if I ice my roommate out?""
In the post I complained about her lack of cleanliness and her selfishness leading me to no other choice than ""icing her out"". For how big of an issue it was, I merely described it as filth. That was too kind. When I said ""ecosystem in my sink"" I literally found some sort of parasitic worm growing in our sink after she thawed a bunch of deer meat using coffee mugs and then never cleaning them and leaving them covered in blood in the sink. When I said ""piles in every corner of our shared spaces"" I would attempt to clean up these piles and then humongous spiders would scitter out because this crap had been sitting there so long that creepy crawlies would make it their home. I still cannot believe I put up with that. I did move out, maybe about a month or so after that original post. What I couldn't see at the time and thus, failed to mention, was that she was quite literally a bad person. I even mean that with no malice. It wasn't even the cleanliness issue that broke the camel's back. A high-schooler she worked with got kicked out for a night and she mentioned he'd be crashing on our couch. I was sympathetic at first and said it was alright for the night. I asked his age and she said he was 18. Him being kicked out for a night turned into ""oh he's coming over tonight to play uno"" where she would then provide him with enough alcohol and weed to incapacitate a horse. This persisted for a couple days throughout the week, for about 2 weeks. I obviously took issue with this. I told her I was worried about 1.) Giving drugs to someone underage,  highly illegal 2.) His parents out looking for him and breaking down our door and 3.) HE IS STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL THIS IS WILDY INNAPROPROATE, I was met with ""You're bf comes over all the time with no warning I don't see the problem"" (obviously paraphrasing). Mind you, my boyfriend is my age and the apartment was so dirty I was ashamed to have him hangout with me anywhere but my room. On top of the high-schooler situation, she would bring in pets without my permission. First a cat,  which I (regrettably) didn't mind since they're pretty independent. On my part, it set a bad precedent. Two years later she ambushed me with a large dog. This poor guy was so lonely. He would crap everywhere because she wouldn't take him out enough. She got tired of  him doing that, so she would lock him in her room when she was gone. When he would crap all over her room and chew up things that smelled like her since he missed her, she would just get angry. When he ate a hole in the wall trying to escape her room, that's when she got a crate. This poor dog lived in a crate while she was out working or drinking or smoking weed. Once she got the dog, she hated the cat for not liking the dog. She would  yell and stomp at him. The whole time she had that cat she only changed the litter box like once every 3 months. I would often try to help these animals but there was also this war inside me that screamed it wasn't my responsibility or my job to finish what she started. I guess my update is that she was much worse than I even let myself realize, and that I am in an immensely better place now. My friend (best friend) that let me move into his spare room was wonderful and showed me how a roommate is really supposed to be. The best part, my bf and I ended up applying to and renting the apartment right below him and we get to visit and play DND with all our friends easy peasy.

I'm 38 male and I've been a digital nomad in the last 3-4 years, primarily in Europe. Typically moving every 3-6 months.

Initially I did some freelancing here and there but for at least 1 year now I've been working solo bootstrapping something on my own, while living off my savings.

However I am suspicious I might be a bit depressed. I don't lay in bed the whole day, but days feel mundane and I just grind through them. Typically I just start working from home, then go to some coffee shop to continue work for 3-4 hours, then get back home, play a bit Nintendo and sleep. Sometimes might hit the gym.

In the past I'd go to meetups but I've given up now, since they seem always like sausage fest with not any interesting going on.  I also did photography, roller skating, longboarding, but I don't have any of these with me, and my body can't take it as hard nowadays. So I end up staying at home and playing Nintendo on my free time. But of course it would be more fun with others.

I've also tried dating apps, but they are hit and miss. In most Mediterranean countries they don't work for an introvert like me. Had better luck in places like London.

Anyone in the same situation? Any tips?

I also don't feel like I have a homebase anymore.. due to moving around for at least 10-20 years in my life, I don't have steady friends anywhere and no place where I feel I belong.

In light of an influx of posts that don’t fit the sub, I would like to clarify how we on the newish ModSquad are filtering what does and doesn’t count as girl dinner.  ☺️

There’s also been an influx of disputes on post removals in the ModMail, many of which communicate to us that some users are interpreting “girl dinner” based purely on effort and gender of the poster, or on money spent or presentation prettiness.

So here’s Rule 4! Recently revamped for clarity and also expounded upon in the wiki✨ Take a gander there for more examples of real dinner vs. girl dinner, plus other recently revamped rules.

As always, we love all ya lil gremlins, and hope you know we are also following your culinary prowess in cooking/recipe subs, and being inspired by your tips & tricks in meal prepping/diet subs. Just gotta direct those types of meals to those types of subs, despite our glowing pride. 😘MWUAH!

——————————————————

Rules Sidebar:

# Rule 4

***Meals must be edible, gathered, improvised, and chaotic.***

Girl dinner ≠ any dinner made by a girl.

In short, girl dinner is:

* **edible** (not just drinks, meds, smokes, etc.)
* **gathered** (a hodgepodge grouping, not one item)
* **improvised** (no high-effort kitchen wizardry, no low-effort takeout)
* **chaotic** (a whacky flavor combo, cultural mashup, goblinesque presentation, etc.)
* **not a meat-n-three plate** (doesn’t fit the entree + coordinating sides format)

👉🏻 I have just updated our auto comment for removals to better reflect how we’re modding and this rule! Sorry for previous confusion on removals! 👈🏻



In wiki:

# What is ""Girl Dinner""?

A girl dinner defies a “proper meal” in every respect.

* Girl Dinner is **not a “meat-n-three” plate**, meaning it is not organized as a main entree (usually a meat) plus the typical 2-3 sides of veggies or starches. It can be a lot of one thing, littler bits of lots of things, all meats, no meats, all sides, no sides… but it is definitely a feral kinda layout.\*
* Girl Dinner is **gathered**. It is scrounged for and cobbled together with the creativity of our highs or on the last dregs of our lows. It’s not just a coffee + a banana wolfed down between shifts, and it’s not just takeout. While drive-thru service is about the outcome, Girl Dinner is about the experience. ✨
* Girl Dinner is **improvised**. It’s not as low-effort as ordering out, but it’s not a high-effort culinary showcase either.\* Girl Dinner usually requires no more than some slicing, boiling, or microwaving. But probably not all those things, and not for all items on your plate. Overall, it’s quick, it’s easy, it’s pretty much unplanned.
* Girl Dinner has **an element of chaos**. It’s about unhinged flavor pairings, disregard for culinary concepts like “style” and “theme”, and a goblinesque attitude toward servingware. It’s also about mixing effort levels and formality levels. For Girl Dinner, you either artfully plate your sour patch kids, beef jerky, and cheese cubes, or eat air fried salmon with your fingers straight out of its aluminum foil “bowl” with shots of whipped cream straight into your mouth for dessert. Or maybe you pair one higher-effort assembly like a veggie egg scramble with raccoony finds like an apple sauce cup and rice cakes dipped in PB. Above all, we keep it chaotic.

 

**\*KEEP IN MIND:**

* Typical vs. feral layout is subjective culture-to-culture. The feral layouts we're looking for would not include a Cajun seafood boil dumped directly onto the table, nor Asian hot pots surrounded by an array of raw dippers. These are typical layouts for balanced meals in their native contexts, though not “normal” to most white North Americans.
* High vs. low effort is also subjective person-to-person.
* Safely preparing most meats goes beyond the simple slicing & microwaving of feral food prep, but meat does have its place in Girl Dinner!
* Some multistep, time-consuming homemade dishes ALSO come in readymade versions from the grocery. Think dolma or bao.
* Some classic r/girldinner staples take more prep work than other more commonly critiqued items! Think deviled eggs vs. salmon filet (which can just be dropped frozen into the air fryer).

Mods will take such caveats into consideration enforcing Rule 4, so specify your methods and readymade products if you're unsure. Plus, the gals & pals here will be grateful to know where you get your goods!",120,1771614220.0,GirlDinner,37,0.92,False

We’re starting something different in Bangalore — slow, thoughtful social meetups designed especially for introverts, geeks, curious minds, and people who prefer real conversations over small talk.

What is this?

A small, curated morning walk + coffee/brunch social.  

No loud music. No pressure. No cringe games.

Think:

• Slow walks in Cubbon Park / calm green spaces  

• Conversation prompts (not forced icebreakers)  

• Small balanced groups (around 12–20 people)  

• Genuine connections — friendships or dating, both welcome

Who is this for?

• Introverts / soft-spoken folks  

• Techies, creatives, readers, thinkers  

• People who prefer calm, respectful social settings  

• Age range roughly late 20s–30s (flexible)

What this is NOT:

• Not a party scene  

• Not a hookup event  

• Not a massive crowd meetup

We’re currently looking for:

👉 Early participants who resonate with the vibe  

👉 People comfortable helping co-host future walks (optional)

If this sounds like your kind of Sunday morning, comment or DM with:

1) A short intro about you  

2) What kind of social spaces you enjoy  

3) Whether you’re more interested in joining or helping organize

🎿 Skiing

🌲 Exploring nature with friends

📷 Photography

🍖Trying great food (especially Italian & Chinese)

Always down for coffee chats, outdoor adventures, or just casual hangouts. I’d also love to connect with people in Vancouver’s finance space, whether that’s banking, audit, consulting, etc. I currently work in corporate FP&A

We had been to Nashik before this trip which was for a day and visited Goda Aarti, Sita Gufa,Mtdc boat club in the afternoon to kill sometime, got some kondaji chivda. 

This one was 3 days 2 Nights. For some context we got an Airbnb.Same one as previous, the host was superb and i personally do reccommend to check out Airbnb. Last time around Uber was a hassle to book and we kept getting rejected for rides and one of the best decisions to go with was Zoomcar. Mind you their policies aren't the most equal on consumers but luckily we got great hosts throughout. 

This time around this is how our 3 days looked like

1st day we covered Sinnar.Very beautiful windmills to see. And ofcourse gondeshwar temple. We took our time and sunset near the windmills was great. 

2nd day we went to Trimbakeshwar Jyotirling. This was our main purpose. Something's to keep in mind. Go on a weekday if you can. Get the online pass for darshan if you wish to for 200rs per person. It makes the process a bit easier. We reached by 8am and got done with darshan by 8.25am. Super effortless. Pay and park is available.Post to that we went to Grape Embassy for Misal. Very worth the hype. Atleast we loved it. Not sure if there are better places but this was great. Post to which we went to a super underrated flower field near Peruchi Wadi road. A local family was very open to host us for sometime to see around.  These are local people's properties so kindly ensure there's no tresspassing and permission from them before entering.They were very kind to let us even feed their cow and also gave away bunch of flowers to us. Super moving,we almost didn't want to leave for 2 hours. 
We also ended up going to Kashyapi Dam. Again very serene and calm. Very less crowded.Then we went to Mtdc boat club. the sunset cruise views were magnificient but we ended up having a shitty driver unfortunately who ruined our experience and was fighting with everyone on the cruise. 

3rd day was a coffe plantation visit & a boutique vineyard . 100% reccommended if you're into knowing how coffee works from A to Z. The one we visited was Silver Oak coffe plantation. Post that was Grape Berry vineyard, again we were quite impressed with the service and the host. Extremely informative. Has a great sunset view and less crowded and nearer compared to Nipha. 


Also shoutout to Healthy Meals Gangapur. We were on a mission to eat clean as much as we can and they made it so much tastier and affordable. All our meals were picked from here. Very clean,gut friendly and interesting meals.

The people in Nashik are super duper nice. Would love to visit again!

I was wondering about the **pricing model**  
If a café used a digital loyalty system that replaces stamp cards, would it make more sense to:  
• Pay a fixed monthly fee for the service?  
• Or pay a small bonus only when a full loyalty card is completed ( when repeat visits actually happen)

Personally, Ithink that the bonus model suits better, since you only earn if the system actually proves it’s driving repeat visits.",2,1771613644.0,Coffee_Shop,0,1.0,False
1ra3z00,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1ra3z00/im_building_the_thing_everyone_told_me_not_to/,I'm building the thing everyone told me not to build. Here's why I'm doing it anyway.,"Every single person I've spoken to has told me the AI agent space is too crowded. And yeah, they're right. There are hundreds of tools out there. VC backed teams with 50 engineers. New launches every week.

But here's what none of them can explain to me. If the space is so crowded, why does every business owner I talk to still say the same thing?

""I know AI can help me. I just can't get it to actually work.""

The tools either need a developer to set up, or they demo beautifully and fall apart the moment your workflow has more than three steps. And almost every single one forces your data onto their servers. No transparency. No control. If you're in finance, healthcare, legal, or honestly any business that gives a damn about their data, that's a dealbreaker before you even start.

So I'm building the thing I wish already existed.

A no code AI agent platform where you build visually, connect to your real tools, and self host on your own infrastructure if you want to. Your data stays yours. Period.

But the platform is just the starting point. Here's what gets me out of bed in the morning.

Imagine an agent that watches your inbox overnight, triages every support ticket by urgency, drafts responses for the easy ones, and wakes up your team only when something actually needs a human. An agent that runs vulnerability scans across your entire infrastructure at 3am and your security team has a full report before their first coffee. One that handles every new employee's onboarding, sets up permissions, generates compliance docs, and nobody had to chase a single person. A sales agent that researches every prospect on your list, enriches your CRM, and has personalised follow ups queued before your sales team even opens their laptop.

No developer needed. No data leaving your servers. And when something breaks at step 7 in the chain, you can see exactly what happened, why it happened, and fix it in minutes.

I'm a few weeks into the MVP and building this whole thing in public because sitting in silence for 6 months and launching to crickets isn't a strategy.

Three things I've already learned that surprised me:

The AI is the easy part. Keeping agents reliable when you chain 10 different tools together is where everyone falls apart. Every competitor demos the happy path. Nobody shows you what happens when things go wrong. That's the gap.

Talking to potential users before having anything to show felt uncomfortable. But it already completely changed what I'm prioritising. Features I was convinced were essential turned out to be irrelevant. Problems I hadn't even thought about turned out to be the whole reason someone would pay.

The ""crowded market"" thing falls apart fast when you actually use the existing tools. Most are overengineered for developers or too fragile for anything real. The bar is genuinely lower than it looks from the outside.

If you've tried using AI agents in your business and hit walls, tell me what went wrong. Seriously. That's worth more to me right now than any feature request.",2,1771613569.0,SaaS,2,1.0,False

So basically, it's totally justified to right-hook a 77 year old man just because he complained about service. But why? Because, you'll see ignorant human being, he was a sex offender! It's even great he didn't even get any jail time, he did a great job ?

But that's something that is known AFTERWARDS; this dangerously nervous for society prick didn't know that, then, it's totally illogical to think it's something to be proud of. In fact, It could have been your very own grumpy but relatively harmless grandpa; What if he had taken the sucker punch instead? Would you be proud of it? This guy could have killed any old head over a fucking coffee, and acting like that isn't sickening is a problem. Reducing reality to an specific case and of an actual inherently violent nature is.

And, then, do you think a guy that without knowing any additional info of someone, (except knowing its a DAMN OLD man, but guess his brain its not brainy) can kill him is going to care after any kind of info is revealed afterwards?

I guess one of today's fashion is to glorify the people that kill this bastards due to, in great part, the Epstein case, but now it has turned into a dogmatic cult blind-faith-like bullshit that people use to justify the hate that evokes from them. And no, I don't care they are bastards, you can't just start to kill anybody because guess, you aren't a fucking FBI member from a famous TV show that knows procedure and that whose intelect is by far superior than yours; you are just a regular keyboard warrior that is blinded by the first emotional response .

In your presence,

Under your gloomy ray,

All my despair and sorrow

Seems to fade away.

When your meek, luminous gaze

Met with mine languid eyes,

It felt the same as if

I was staring in the dreamy skies.


Oh my precious, gentle muse,

I wish for both of us to fuse

Full of mirth, with not the slightest mire,

Both of us will blow into the zephyr.

As lovebirds we two will sing,

Of every of our life's bling.

And young lovers of the country shire,

Our every song they would admire.


We would travel accross the countryside,

The beauteous mountains where we would glide,

The mickle and hilly beverageous estates,

Taste some coffee, and some tea,

There you would dance with me.

We will have a blissful time,

We will sing a melodious rhyme.

Our whole life will bear witness

To all the love in this world combined.


Then we will travel across the bohemian sands of rajasthan,

You, My Sultana, and I, your Sultan.

Seek the glorious tales of the Rajputs,

Swing through the palace of winds.

You, before me, and I, after you,

To the whispering dunes - we bid adieu.


And now to the mughlai gates of Delhi,

The sun warm, the people bizarre,

The air whimsical, and the moon gloomy.

Romance in the streets, and in the bazaar,

Precious You - with an appearance bloomy.

I stand in the moonlight square,

Oh, why do I stare in the sky?

When my beauteaous moon is here!


When old folks would sit down

In evenings with their young shoots,

They would tell them of our tale,

The young fellows would relate without fail.

Oh, I wish this fantasy would come true.

Oh, rather take me to rot in jail,

Than to leave me with this life I rue.",2,1771613305.0,Poems,0,1.0,False

Our first child is 14 months old. I am 5'4 and in good shape. Of course I'm bigger now being in my 3rd trimester, but for being 3rd trimester AND having a 14 month old, I think I look pretty good.

I completely forget how it came up, but my husband told me one of his friends pointed out awhile back that I was not his type, so he was curious what made me the one. I asked my husband what he meant by me not being his type. He said it was because he normally dated very tall and very slender women prior to me. He (my husband) said he told him that most of the women he dated before me liked to drink and go out to clubs. He said he liked the fact that I didn't drink and preferred hiking and going to quiet restaurants and coffee shops with friends. My husband said he feels a level of trust and connection with me that he never experienced with anyone else before and that mattered above all else.

As much as I appreciate him saying that, I am also pissed off. I am not an unattractive woman. I don't think I'm a 10, but I'm confident that the general consensus would be 7-8 for me. Also, I am damn proud of how I look considering that I'm 33 weeks pregnant with our second child considering that our first is only 14 months old. His comments make me feel like he and his friend consider me a step down appearance wise, but it's okay because I'm trustworthy. Of course, I told my husband this and he went on to tell me how beautiful I am and that none of that was for me to be taken as seeming unattractive. Still though, that's exactly how it feels and being 3rd trimester pregnant with insomnia is hard enough.

I don’t know how to pray but I said to myself if I struggle with fasting one thing I owe to myself is to use this time to learn how to pray. My concerns when it comes to fasting is that I would literally never tell a soul I believe in Islam, that’s hard for some people to grasp but my entire family and friends we literally have never grew up around Islam or known any Muslims it’s quite a foreign idea to us and honestly people would think I’ve lost my mind. Another concern is work because I am a coffee and nicotine junkie I find it extremely hard to have motivation throughout the day without either or the two and I’m sure a lot of people can relate. 

I told myself today I will fast for one hour and see how I go well I fasted the whole day until Maghreb which was extremely hard without caffeine or nicotine. I am happy and proud of myself and I wouldn’t have been able to do it without remembering God. I have let myself down as when I broken my fast I went and bought a vape despite me adamantly throwing my vape away last night. I really want to try give up my vape permanently but it is so hard. I am also going to try my absolute hardest to not drink during Ramadan.

1ra3qrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ra3qrj/hm_the_politics_of_concrete/,[HM] The Politics of Concrete,"Johnny Faucet and Billy Sink—not their given names—were deep in the bowels of a concrete processing plant at a time when no one was supposed to be deep in the bowels of anything. Johnny, who fancied himself the brains, lit a cigarette beneath a smoke detector he had bashed with a borrowed sledgehammer. Billy had his ear to an inexplicably large vault and his palm on a small dial.

“Listen, all I’m saying is it would be a great idea. We buy the rights to Terminator off some shlub for pennies on the dollar and turn it into a kid’s program. People are going to love it.” Johnny’s voice had taken on the frantic, crispy tone he often got after several cups of coffee, accompanying cigarettes, and good old-fashioned breaking and entering.

“Uh huh.” Billy was doing his best to feign interest while also listening to the delicate clicks of the lock.

“We’d make millions. Think of the little T-shirts that say: ‘I’ll be back’. Parents would eat that shit up.” Johnny paced, each footstep kicking up small plumes of concrete dust. “Fuck, I wish I had pen and paper for this gold.”

“Uh huh.” Billy twisted the dial and heard a satisfying click. One of the vault’s three locks popped open. “One down, two to go.” He took his palm off the dial and wiped the sweat on his pants.

“Are you even listening to me, man?” asked Johnny.

Billy stood, leaving thoughts of the vault behind for a moment. He had a loaded gun in the back of his waistband. Shooting Johnny would certainly solve a lot of problems, but at the end of the day, he was fun at parties. “Johnny, no, I’m not listening to you. Why are we here?”

Johnny spluttered. “You’re not—”

“Why are we here?” Billy repeated calmly.

Johnny took a long drag off his cigarette. “To prove our government is putting 5G receivers in sidewalks near schools to control the minds of our kids.”

Billy nodded. “And what’s in the vault?”

“Evidence,” answered Johnny.

Billy let out a breath. *So he had been paying attention.* “Yes. Evidence we spent the last five years searching for.”

“Hard years.”

“Hard years,” agreed Billy.

Johnny was still pacing. “You lost your wife.”

Billy grimaced. “Yes, I did.” Billy’s wife had been less of a critical thinker than he was. When their daughter came out, she accepted it without question. Meanwhile, Billy saw the pattern. There were certain districts where kids just acted funny. Football players took up drama, young conservatives started reading Vonnegut, the list went on. Billy bought a 5G detector, his wife and daughter moved out. *Pretty soon they’ll understand.*

Johnny stopped moving. “I’m talking too much again, aren’t I?” The twinge of shame was only slightly outweighed by the manic whites of his eyes.

Billy brushed off the memories. “Yes, you are. I can barely hear the lock. At this point, we’re going to be here until morning. What happens in the morning?”

“People get here.”

“Right.”

“So, I should shut up?”

“Yes.”

“Well alright then.”

Billy turned back to the vault. He could feel it. They were close. The research, the work, the isolation, it was finally going to pay off.

“But Billy.”

Billy spun around, two breaths away from putting a bullet in Johnny and dumping him in a cement mixer. “Yes, Johnny?”

“Do you think my idea was good?”

Billy looked at him, all seriousness in the world. “If we get the evidence, I bet they’ll give you the rights to Terminator for free.”

Johnny’s widened even further. “Bet your right.”

“Now, Johnny, do your job and keep watch. Pull a gun out or something, make it look like you’re trying.”

Johnny saluted and pulled his comically large revolver from its holster. Its chrome shone in the dim light, almost making Johnny look like a movie star—aside from the balding, scarred arms from nervous picking, and tobacco-stained teeth.

Billy saluted back. He didn’t have any military experience and frankly didn’t believe in organized governments with firearms, but it felt right. Billy returned his attention to the vault. Without Johnny’s incessant yapping, the second lock was much smoother. Titan locks were flashier than they were secure. For most people, a vault that looked uncrackable was more important.

The second lock clicked.

“How’s it going?” asked Johnny.

Billy blew out a breath and held it. “Fine, Johnny.”

“Oh good. You think we could get Linda Hamilton to guest star?”

Why on earth had he brought Johnny along? *He’s dumb as bricks, but he’ll keep a secret.* At the end of the day, Billy needed someone who could shut up and look intimidating holding a gun. One out of two wasn’t bad. “You want Linda Hamilton on your children’s show about Terminator?”

Johnny nodded, the crazy flare back in his eyes.

“I’d watch that, but you know what you should watch instead?” asked Billy.

“Landman?”

“No, the damned perimeter.” It took all his effort not to shout.

“Right, right, the perimeter, right. I’ve got this.”

Billy tuned out Johnny’s relentless pacing and focused on the vault again. He liked locks. They were predictable. With each minute turn, gears spun and tiny mechanisms fell into place. It was orderly and reminded him of a time when things were simpler, when concrete was concrete, and he didn’t have to worry about what lay beneath. He spun the dial a final time. The lock clicked.

Billy stepped back, looking at the massive wheel to open the vault. “You ready Johnny?”

Johnny approached. “How long we been dreaming of this?”

“Too long.”

“Abigail is going to be so happy when she hears about this.”

Billy’s anger flared. The government would pay for what they did to his daughter. “A whole lot of people are going to be angry. This is the first domino in the revolution, brother.”

Johnny clapped him on the back. “Amen to that.”

Billy spun the vault’s wheel and pulled the heavy door. It swung open with ease.

The vault was the size of a small office. Its walls were lined with filing cabinets and stacked wooden crates. Sitting in the middle, tied up to a chair, was a gagged woman in a tattered suit.

“Holy shit, they have hostages,"" said Johnny.

The woman squinted out at them. She tried to speak, but it only came out as muffled cries.

“Help her,” said Billy. “I’ll check the files. If they have hostages, we might be in deeper shit than we thought.”

Johnny put his revolver away and hurried to the woman, untying her gag.

Billy went to the filing cabinets and started leafing through papers. Anything kept in a vault was worth reading, but they needed to be quick. He skimmed, looking for any mention of 5G or plans for the school district. What he found instead were names of powerful politicians, business owners, and billionaires.

The muffled cries turned into words as Johnny removed the woman’s gag. “Oh, thank God you’re here. I don’t know how long I’ve been in here, but I was starting to lose hope.”

“Those bastards. Here, let’s get you untied,” said Johnny. “Don’t worry, we’re here to expose these bad men for what they’ve done.”

Billy continued leafing through the files. Not a damned mention of 5G in the bunch. Then, he pulled a file with a name that stopped him cold. The salacious details of the paper were clear in an instant. All familiar anger flared again.

“That’s what I was trying to do,” said the woman. “I’m a journalist. These men are covering up a ped—”

“Put her gag back in.” Billy put the file away and turned around.

“What?” said Johnny.

“Yeah, what?!” shouted the woman.

Billy approached her. “I thought I recognized you. Johnny, gag her and check her pockets.”

“But Billy.”

“Now.”

“I thought you wanted to—” the woman was cut off as the gag went in her mouth.

Johnny searched her pockets. “Sorry, ma’am. I’m sure this is all a misunderstanding.”

“It ain’t,” said Billy.

Johnny pulled out a small press ID badge. “Oh shit,” he said.

“Told you,” said Billy.

Johnny showed Billy the badge. “She’s one of them!”

Billy nodded.

“What’s in the files?”

“Propaganda she wanted us to find. Best you don’t look. Their forgeries are getting better every day.”

The journalist screamed through her gag.

“Oh save it. We know they’ll be by to let you out as soon as we leave.”

Johnny looked at the woman with genuine hurt in his eyes. “I can’t believe I trusted you.”

“Come on Johnny, let’s get out of here.”

Johnny looked around the vault and stepped out. “It’s a damned shame.”

The woman looked a them, a single tear rolling down one cheek.

Without a word, Billy left and shut the vault’s door. He spun the wheel backwards and listened to the three locks click.

“No 5G in the concrete, huh?” asked Johnny.

“Guess not.”

“Think it’s in the water?”

Billy shrugged. “The fluoride would mess with the signal.”

“Damn, you’re right.”

Billy clapped Johnny on the back. “Don’t worry, we’ll get them.”

Johnny smiled. “You really think so?”

“Finding this vault means we were close.”

“What about that brick laying company? Schools have a lot of bricks.”

1ra3och,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1ra3och/my_puppy_isreally_good/,My puppy is…really good???,"Don’t get me wrong, this is not a complaint or a pain point. I’m just very confused.

My puppy has been very well behaved from the very get go. I got her at eight weeks, she is now about to be 14 weeks, and she has just been a dream.

The very first week, as she took to the crate just fine, a little bit of crying but nothing too crazy. I think we got up one or two times for a wee. I think by day four, she was sleeping all the way through the night in the crate.

We also had a major thunderstorm on the third or fourth day that I got her, thunder shaking the house, the loudest rain I’ve ever heard, she didn’t make a peep. I was more scared than her!

By 10 weeks, she had almost completely stopped biting our ankles and pant legs, and I don’t remember the last time she got overtired, feral, zoomy and bitey. She plays independently next to me with her toys, scoots around outside in my eye line, and then put herself down for a nap when she’s ready.

She’s also just started taking to crate naps very well, sometimes up to 2 1/2 hours at a time.

I leave her at home with complete confidence, and when I get home she is sitting on the couch, clearly just been asleep, and looks up at me as if to say “Oh. You’re home. Cool.”

I take her to so many places with me, she is a celebrity at our local coffee shop, and is so brave and loving meeting new people. Whenever someone comes to the door at our house, she jumps up to them, tail wagging, no biting at all and no barking, and flops on her back for a belly rub. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever really heard her bark, she’s not reactive to sounds outside, sirens, or thunderstorms as per above.

She’s been great at potty training, the only time she really has accidents is when I miss her cues, so it’s not her fault.

I also started lease training very early on, and she now walks completely loose leash on a harness around my backyard and up and down the driveway. Will report back if it’s a different story on a real walk once she’s fully vaccinated! That might be a little more exciting for her.

I feel I must say though – I am very strict with my training. Any time she has had a wobble in the crate and screamed for an hour, I was very stubborn and never gave in. Every time she bit my pant legs or my ankles, I ignored her every single time and she quickly realised that the fun ends when she does something wrong. And – naps are a complete game changer, as soon as they get enough sleep the behavioural difference is night and day.

I know pups are quick learners, they are little sponges, but this dog has just been amazing. Just wanted to get that out.

This will be long, so thank you to whoever reads it.","I (24M) have been dating this girl (22F) for about 6 months. We have had a couple little arguments, but nothing crazy. She is from another country, and that country is very different culturally. She had never had a boyfriend or experienced anything relationship wise before. Her communication honestly sucks, but I have always tried to give her the benefit of the doubt because she is new here and like I said, never been in a relationship before. We have always worked through these things and once I explained to her how certain things worked in relationships, most of the time she was receptive. 
However, this past week has been very hard. A couple days before Valentine’s Day, we had woken up together, had a great morning and throughout the day she was texting me saying very sweet things and making me feel very loved. It was awesome. Later that night, I asked when we could see each other on Valentine’s Day, because I know that she had something important to do that day, (protest for her home country) more important than Valentine’s Day, but figured even if it was for a few minutes to exchange gifts and things like that, we could do that. She told me that she wouldn’t be able to because she would be getting home late and we could the next day. Valentine’s Day also happened to be our 6 month anniversary. I got a little upset, and told her that I support her fully in what she was doing but the fact that she couldn’t make time later in the day upset me. I realized that I was being a bit selfish, and immediately apologized for it before she even read the previous message. That didn’t matter, and she immediately got cold and shut down. Didn’t talk to me all day the next day, which was normal for her to be able to cool off and gather her thoughts. She texted me around 6pm that day, and said she would let that go because she loves me. We were good, but I could tell she was still a bit upset. Which was also normal for her. Come Valentine’s Day, we exchanged heartfelt messages in the morning and it felt like everything was back to normal. 
I wasn’t expecting to see her that day, and I was okay with that because what she was doing and how she was feeling about that was much more important than Valentine’s Day. But she got back around 5pm, was with her friend and her friends mom and said she would be home around 7:30pm if I wanted to see her, and she would be able to make time. I got excited and got ready, and then around 7pm she texts me saying that she was actually going to stay over there tonight and she will see me tomorrow. (I know she is not cheating, I know this friend and it’s a girl, the only family connection she has from her home country) I did get a little annoyed, but I wasn’t mad and just liked her message. I did not mean to, but I fell asleep watching a movie later on and didn’t text her goodnight. The next day, we both had work, and we didn’t talk all day. Just walking by each other and barely even looking at each other. I asked her if we could talk on her break, and she said that we can talk when we both get off of work later that night. We did, and she immediately broke up with me. Saying that we don’t understand each other, when she had just told me literal days before that she feels like I understand her more than anyone. This was the day after Valentine’s Day, and we didn’t talk up until yesterday when I just asked her if we could have a conversation about everything, and now tomorrow we are going to have coffee and talk before work. My question is, how do I go about this? It feels like her feelings for me just switched off like a light switch and I have been going absolutely crazy trying to understand how she can do that. Because like I said, we were doing so so good for probably 2 months straight before that. And the day it started, she was telling me the sweetest things before it went bad. Didn’t have one argument, and really started to feel like we were growing together. I was the first person to *do anything* with her if you get what I’m saying, and I just don’t understand how she can look past all of that, and all of the good because of this one thing. It doesn’t make sense to me. How should I approach this conversation with her? I don’t want to seem desperate, but I really fell so hard for this girl in such a short amount of time and I don’t want it to end over something that could be so easily fixed. My heart hurts, and for the past 5 days she has seemed so cold and shut off towards me and I just really cannot understand how she can turn her feelings off for me like a light switch. Anything would help. Thank you

1ra3gvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Low-Astronaut3147/comments/1ra3gvp/international_student_brain_moments_budget_math/,"International Student Brain Moments: Budget Math, Weather Confusion, and Other Realities No One Warns You About","# 

There is a very specific kind of logic that develops when you become an international student in the UK.

It’s not regular logic.

It’s survival logic.

It’s converting every pound into your home currency while simultaneously pretending you’re not doing that. It’s calling a meal deal “luxury dining.” It’s checking the weather five times before stepping outside — and still being wrong.

Here are some international student brain moments that make complete sense when you live them… and no sense when you try to explain them.

# The Budget Math That Makes No Sense

When I first moved, every purchase required mental gymnastics.

A coffee costs £3.50.

My brain:  
“That’s reasonable.”  
Also my brain:  
“Wait, convert it.”

You do the math.  
You gasp.  
You reconsider your life choices.

International students develop two financial personalities:

Version 1:  
“It’s fine. It’s just a few pounds.”

Version 2:  
“That’s three meals back home.”

The contradiction is constant.

You celebrate small financial victories:

* Finding discounted groceries
* Splitting costs with friends
* Discovering which supermarket is cheaper
* Realising utilities are included in rent

And then you question why basic necessities feel like strategic decisions.

Budgeting abroad teaches you restraint, prioritisation, and the art of distinguishing between “need” and “impulse.”

# The Weather Obsession

Before moving, I knew the UK had unpredictable weather.

What I didn’t expect was how often I would check it.

Sunny at 10 AM.  
Cloudy at 12 PM.  
Rain at 2 PM.  
Clear skies at 4 PM.

International student brain logic:  
Carry an umbrella.  
Wear layers.  
Regret both choices simultaneously.

You slowly build a wardrobe based on survival rather than aesthetics:

* Practical coat
* Waterproof shoes
* Neutral sweaters
* Layers for all seasons in one day

And somehow, you still complain.

# The Accent Processing Phase

In the first few weeks, understanding accents feels like solving a puzzle.

You nod.  
You smile.  
You process what was said five seconds later.

Then one day, you realise something subtle — you understood everything instantly.

That’s when you know you’re adapting.

But until then, international student brain works overtime.

# Grocery Store Reality Check

Your first grocery run abroad is humbling.

You don’t know:

* Which brand is affordable
* What sizes are normal
* What’s actually good quality

You pick items randomly.  
You overspend.  
You forget essentials.

Then gradually, you become strategic.

You know:

* Which store has student discounts
* Which aisle has reduced items
* What meal combinations are cost-efficient

Survival budgeting becomes a skill.

# The “Walk Everywhere” Lifestyle

Back home, you may have relied on cars.

In the UK, especially in student cities, walking becomes normal.

You calculate distance differently:  
“Is it under 20 minutes? I’ll walk.”

Cold wind? Walk.  
Light rain? Walk.  
Heavy rain? Still walk, but complain.

Public transport becomes backup, not default.

And strangely, walking clears your head. It becomes part of your routine.

# The Social Adjustment

International student brain also overthinks social situations.

Should I introduce myself first?  
Are they forming groups already?  
Is everyone more confident than me?

Reality: most people are equally unsure.

The difference is consistency. The more you attend classes, societies, and events, the more familiar faces become familiar conversations.

Friendships abroad aren’t instant. They’re built through repeated interaction.

# The Emotional Highs and Lows

Some days you feel proud:  
You navigated the city alone.  
You handled a seminar discussion confidently.  
You cooked a proper meal.

Other days feel small:  
You miss home.  
You feel tired.  
You question your decisions.

Both can exist at the same time.

International student life isn’t dramatic every day. It’s ordinary most days. And that’s what makes it real.

# Country-Specific Student Life in the UK

There are patterns you’ll notice:

* Students live close to campus when possible because convenience matters.
* Shared kitchens become unexpected social spaces.
* Libraries are full during exam season, no matter the weather.
* Student discounts feel like financial blessings.

Over time, the city stops feeling foreign and starts feeling familiar.

# The Growth You Don’t Notice

All these small, slightly chaotic moments add up.

You become better at:

* Managing money
* Navigating uncertainty
* Adjusting quickly
* Making decisions independently

The “budget math that makes no sense” eventually turns into financial awareness.

The weather obsession turns into preparation.

The accent confusion turns into confidence.

# Final Thought

International student brain feels chaotic at first.

But underneath the overthinking, conversions, and grocery confusion, something powerful is happening.

You’re learning how to function independently in a new system.

And one day, you’ll catch yourself advising someone else on budgeting, housing, or surviving UK weather.

That’s when you realise: the confusion phase was just the beginning of growth.

I’ve been single for 14 months because I refuse to settle for hookup culture. It’s been lonely, but I wanted something real. One day, I was in a hotel lobby in Mumbai and a beautiful white retriever and his owner walked up to me  That’s how I met him . We had a minimal conversation and I got to know he’s from New York and was visiting for work.he instantly asked me do you wanna have a glass of champagne. I said I don't drink alcohol but a coffee works and we exchanged numbers.But i know he was just visiting and that confused me to the core .
​When he asked me out, I was very honest. I told him I don’t do hookups . He didn't mind at all. He told me he was ""hooked"" and just wanted to get to know me. For three months, he was amazing. He was so gentle, he never pressured me to do anything physical, and he gave me all the time I needed to feel comfortable. He genuinely just loved my company and, of course, I loved spending time with him and his dog.
​When he went back to New York, I was worried because he’s so handsome and the 10.5-hour time difference is huge. But he stayed so loyal. He was always on calls with me and remembered every little detail I told him. He eventually came back to India, and we traveled abroad to a lot of countries together.
​In Malaysia, he asked me to be his girlfriend in a beautiful setup .He gave a long ass speech about what I mean to him .This is exactly what I waited over a year for, but I froze. I couldn't say yes. He just started a new job with a lot of pressure, and I’m so scared of how we will manage the distance while we both work. Now he is very upset because he feels he has done everything right, but I am just stuck in my head worrying about the future. Am I being unfair for being this scared?

Back at the castle.
SMG4 (quiet):
Right…
SMG3:
Seriously? You didn’t notice?
SMG4:
It’s been years since I retired… I didn’t even realize they were gone.
What’s wrong with me?
Tari:
There’s nothing wrong with you.
Luigi:
Yeah! You’ve just had a lot on your mind.
SMG4:

He walks away and closes his door.
Bob:
Well. That was a waste of time.
Saiko:
I can’t believe I sat here for that.
SMG3:
If anyone needs me, I’ll be working on my coffee.
Melony:
Guys… we should be here for him.
Boopkins:
Yeah. He’s been sad ever since he ended the channel.
SMG3:
That was ten years ago. And it was his idea.
Tari and Luigi exchange looks — they get an idea.
Cut to apartment — Mario and Meggy
A phone rings.
Meggy:
Red… can you grab that? I’m tired.
Mario:
Okie dokie!
Mario:
Hello?
Tari (phone):
Hi Mario! Is Meggy there? Luigi and I need to talk to you both.
Luigi:
Hey bro! Long time no see!
Mario:
Sure has!
Meggy:
What’s up, guys?
Tari:
Can you come back to the castle?
Mario:
Really?
Luigi:
Something came up. We could use your help.
Meggy:
We’d love to… but we’re traveling the world right now.
Tari:
I know… but it’s about SMG4.
Mario (serious):
…Really?
Luigi:
He’s depressed. He won’t talk about it.
Tari (pleading):
Please. It feels like our group is falling apart.
Mario and Meggy look at each other.
Meggy:
We’re coming.
Castle doors burst open.
Everyone:
MARIO! MEGGY!
Meggy:
Hey guys! We came as fast as we could!
Tari:
It’s really good to see you again.
Mario:
Of course! So what’ve you guys been up to while we were gone?
Luigi:
Well, Saiko became a rockstar.
Boopkins and Bob started a business.
SMG3’s still running his coffee shop.
Tari’s a game champion.
Melony’s the best manga artist in town…
…and I run the best restaurant in the city!
Meggy:
Whoa… sounds like you’ve all been busy!
SMG3:
We sure have. What about you two?
Mario:
Me and Meggy? We’ve been everywhere. Paris, Brazil… you name it.
Mario:
So… where’s SMG4?
Tari:
He already left.
Meggy:
Really?
Luigi:
Yeah. He said he was excited to go somewhere.
Mario:
That’s suspicious.
Melony:
He didn’t give us details. Just said it would change his life forever.
Bob:
I’m telling you — he’s gonna get scammed. I should know.
Meggy:
Okay guys. It’s clear SMG4 needs us. We’re his friends, no matter what.
Mario:
Exactly! No matter how much time passes, we stick together. And it’s our job to make sure SMG4 knows we’re by his side.
Meggy:
Right. Here’s the plan — I’ll go find him. Red, you stay here in case he comes back.
Mario:
Wait… why only you?
Ohhh, I get it. You don’t think I can do it?
Meggy:
What? No, wait— Red!
Mario runs off. Meggy chases him.
Saiko:
Heh. Good to see them arguing again.
SMG3:
Yeah… it really is.

I have tried just about every stimulant except Vyvanse, and some of them have worked but have aggravated a stomach disorder I have.

My doctor wanted to try 30mg Vyvanse and I took my first dose this morning at 6:30, I ate a small bowl of cereal and had a (large) cup of coffee at 7:00, and by 8:00 I was bouncin off the walls at work. Coffee usually doesn't have an effect on me, I drink it because I enjoy the flavor and experience. It's like the Vyvanse made my body react to coffee how a normal person would if they drank 3 cups.

I'm starting to wonder if having coffee this morning was a bad idea! I'm pretty jittery and my thoughts are a bit more scattered than they already typically are. I figured since it was in my routine to drink that I shouldn't change that for a new med so I could see what it did. Coming up on lunch time now, the coffee has started to finish its course so I'm feeling a somewhat better, just a bit shakey. Definitely less ""Go! Go! Go!"" than I was this morning.

I think I'll skip the coffee tomorrow and see how that goes, but I was curious to know if you guys have similar experiences or if you guys are still able to have caffeine with your meds?",1,1771612185.0,adhdwomen,10,1.0,False

Well, what I got was ground espresso, not the beans. It looks like they were roasted 07/25 with a 2 year shelf life. Amazon will replace them, with beans, like I ordered. We will see how fresh they are. But I went ahead and made a double shot latte and it is definitely smoother than the Lavazza. You really need to use the scale to get the right amount.

It sucks, and you know that the other person completely did you dirty. They might have manipulated you, stabbed you in the back, got with your friends, cheated on you, and after all you have done for them, they took you for granted and left you.

I've been there and it sucks.

Now, your trying to move on. Your looking at the chess board and thinking whats the best next move to do. You think to yourself, ""Maybe I should text them"", or ""Maybe I should fully go ghost and lock in and just improve myself so much and become a millionaire and then they will regret leaving me and I will move on"". The cold hard truth is that no matter what path you go down, whether its trying to fix things with them, or go all into your work, you will still feel hurt inside. Contrary to what people on the internet tell you, ""working on yourself"" (while super beneficial) will not help you ACTUALLY get over them, and you'll just burn yourself out fast and then fall back into your old habits. 

  
""Well what what should I do?"" you might ask yourself. After being in multiple relationships myself (with over 10 women) in the past 3 years, and after trying out all different types of heartbreak tactics to try and move on, here is what I found works for me and for my friends to get over your EX as FAST and efficiently as possible. So in this short guide I hope to share some of the things that helped me and that can help you.

  
**First of all, let's talk about mindset.** If this person was your first partner, or someone you spent a ton of time with, you will naturally feel super connected to them. When you break up, your brain tricks you into thinking you'll never find someone like them ever again. This is a terrible, terrible mindset to have. The truth is, there are 8 billion people on this planet. Assuming you're straight, that's 4 BILLION potential partners out there waiting. You've probably heard 'there's plenty of fish in the sea' a million times and wanted to smack whoever said it but that's literally the simple truth. You found one person, got attached, and now you're acting like they're the only human you'll ever meet who could click with you. Reality check: there are SOOO many options, and wayyy more people who would actually love to be with you and treat you right. Now let me hit you with the even harsher part: if this person wanted to get with someone else, they simply didn't like you enough. Full stop. And no matter what excuses or stories you hear, the reason they didn't like you enough always comes down to exactly 2 things, and it's ALWAYS these two, I don't care what anyone else tries to tell you. It's either

1. You weren't wealthy enough and they found someone who can spoil them more, or
2. You weren't sexually attractive enough and they found someone better looking than you.

That's the TRUTH. Do whatever you want with it, cope, cry, get angry, level up, your call, but it always boils down to those two reasons. You can hit me with 'but we had a massive argument, that's why we broke up' all you want. Okay cool, if you were someone like Drake or Beyoncé, do you really think that person would leave you over an argument? OF COURSE NOT. Those celebrities usually have multiple partners orbiting them, and those partners don't give a single care about the other people in the picture. Why? Because as long as they're getting the attention, the lifestyle, the status, they stay loyal with all their heart. Not because of the celebrity's perfect actions or personality, but because of the looks, the money, and the status. Now the truth is, you and I (probably) aren't celebrities with hordes of people begging to get with us. But this simple mindset shift should make you realize something huge: if you had way more options, status, looks, or money in the equation, you wouldn't be sitting here feeling sad, desperate, or broken over one person walking away. You'd see them for what they are just one option that didn't work out and you'd keep it moving.

  
**Now, how do you ACTUALLY get over them.** And I will go over 2 scenarios that you can peruse depending on the situation. One of the scenarios you will likely fall into.

The first scenario is **IF** the breakup happened less than 48 hours ago and the other partner **DIDN'T** cheat on you or get with someone else in that timeframe, (contrary what people on the internet might say) I think its fine for you to go back to them and try and talk things through. You guys had a big argument and needed a little bit of time to cool down, but as long as the other partner didnt cheat, its honestly fine to go back to them.

If your EX did cheat, and its been over 48 hours, for your dignity and respect for yourself, leave them in the dust and never go back. They simply don't care for you and you have to move on.

Now to start moving on, the first thing you must realize is that the only way you will get over this person is that you must get attached to someone else. There are certain qualities you liked in your EX that you got attached to, and in the next person you meet you will see other qualities in them that might be different, that you will like too.

NOW, the first thing you must do to actually move on is to use dating apps and swipe one hundred times a day on them. I know this sounds cliché, but if you use dating apps and actually put effort into swiping as well as taking professional photos and looking your best, then you will get matches. If you are a girl, you will most likely naturally get tons of likes on your profile. This is great since you immediately have a large selection of men to choose from, and from there you should start going on multiple dates to sift through guys and figure out who is best for you. Speaking to the men now, you must work on your profile. If you do not have a good profile, there is zero point to using dating apps, since women are much more selective when choosing men than men are when choosing women. To make a good profile, first look at things from a woman's perspective of what she sees when swiping. You can do this by asking a female friend or by looking up ""Tinder from a girl's perspective"" online. What you will see is your competition, and you will realize that most men's profiles are terrible, which is actually great for you. Now, depending on how you look, find a celebrity lookalike of yourself and basically start copying their Instagram vibe. This will depend heavily on your appearance and personality, but aim to find someone who could be seen as a better version of you on Instagram and try to recreate their photos as closely as possible. That is it. Then, you must get the premium versions of the apps so that your messages can go to the top and your profile is shown more often. I want you to swipe one hundred times a day per dating app. Hinge, Tinder, and Bumble are your best options. To be honest, I would swipe one hundred times a day per app every morning right after waking up.

If you have a solid profile and you look somewhat good, you don't need to overcomplicate the messages you send. A simple ""hey"" will be fine, no need to write any jokes or weird messages. Act normally and I swear you will be flooded with dates.

Then comes the actual date. Here’s what I recommend: Don’t go splurging or trying to impress with fancy stuff. Skip the expensive restaurants, long drawn-out activities, or anything that screams “I’m desperate to win you over.” Keep it simple and low-pressure, a quick coffee spot if it’s cold out, or an ice cream place in the summer. That’s it. Chill vibe, low commitment, cheap as hell. Plus, you’re not setting the bar sky-high right away, so they don’t start expecting bougie dates every time or think you’re some baller who’s gonna drop stacks forever. Play it smart, start basic, build from there.

From this moment onwards, you should be meeting new people and going on so many dates that you have fully forgotten about the other person by now. And thats it! Thats exactly how to move on!! Congratulations if you followed my exact steps and mentality, you will have found at least someone else you like within a month.

Yeah I know a little late. I have never done much finishing and I am a little nervous about what type to choose. After doing alot of reading, I am leaning toward using a hard wax oil finish. Also, what should I use something to clean the surfaces before applying the finish? Mineral spirits?",4,1771611869.0,finishing,5,1.0,False

We spend more time deciding where to eat than actually eating.

Group chats. Yelp scrolling. “Where do you wanna go?” loops.

So I built SilverSpoon AI — an app that removes decision fatigue around food.

Instead of searching endlessly, you:

• pick your vibe (date night, brunch, coffee, etc.)

• swipe restaurants with friends together

• vote on a winner

• get AI suggestions on what to order

• plan trips around food

It basically acts like a dining concierge.

Still early — would love honest feedback from Reddit.

Tear it apart if you want.

1ra35sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nagpur/comments/1ra35sb/connecting_people_making_new_friends/,Connecting People. Making New friends.,"Hey folks,
22M here. Spent the last 3 years in Nagpur during my undergrad. Had a big circle back then… though with time I realized most of them were more acquaintances than real friends.

Moved out for research recently, but Nagpur still feels like home in a weird way. The chai tapris, random late-night talks, Seminary Hills sunsets, that slow but comforting vibe — kinda miss it all.

I’ll be back in the city for my convocation soon and thought, why not meet new people this time around? No labels, no pressure — just good conversations and genuine vibes. Age and gender don’t matter, energy does.

If you’re someone who enjoys meaningful chats, random walks, ideas about life/tech/research, or just chilling over coffee — I’m up for it.
