This is Part 2: The Product Truths. (My product team stopped speaking to me.)

**The realization that  broke everything:**

Month 8 of research. Sitting in coffee shop at 2:34am. Can’t sleep.  Just finished reading the 441st startup case study.

Pattern emerging that made zero sense: **The companies that religiously followed user feedback… died. The ones that ignored it strategically… became unicorns.**

Wait. What?

Pulled up spreadsheet. 847 companies. New column: “How closely did they follow user requests?”

**The math that destroyed my worldview:**

- Companies that built exactly what users asked for: 89% failed
- Companies that built what users needed (not asked for): 91% became unicorns
- The correlation was  inverse to everything I’d been taught

My product management training just became expensive toilet paper.


## THE BREAKING POINT (Friday, 11:47pm)

Reading Brian Chesky interview about Airbnb. He said something that made me spit out my coffee:

*“If we’d listened to users in 2008, we’d have  built a better air mattress. They literally told us: ‘Make the mattresses more comfortable.’ We ignored them and built trust systems instead.”*

Pulled up more examples:

- **Instagram:** Users begged for more features.  Kevin Systrom deleted 13 features instead.
- **WhatsApp:** Users demanded stickers, games, monetization. Jan Koum said no for 5 years.
- **Superhuman:** Users wanted it cheaper than $30/month. Rahul Vohra raised it to $33/month.

Every one became massive. By ignoring users.

**The spreadsheet that  made me question everything:**

Built analysis framework:

1. What users SAID they wanted
1. What founders actually built
1. The gap between them
1. Outcome (success/failure)

**Result:** 0.89 correlation between “ignoring specific user requests”  and “achieving unicorn status.”

I was furious. Three years of product management training. All wrong.


## PART 2: PRODUCT & CUSTOMERS (Truths 11-20)

### Truth #11: Your Best Feature Is The One You Haven’t Built Yet. And Your Customers Don’t Know They Need It.

**The pattern that broke  conventional wisdom:** Winners stay perpetually dissatisfied.

**Apple:** Steve Jobs (2001-2015). Released iPod. Could’ve stopped. “We won digital music!”

Instead: iPhone (2007). Could’ve stopped. “We won phones!”  
Then: iPad (2010). Could’ve stopped.  
Then: Watch (2015).  
Then: Services (2019).  
Never satisfied. Never “done.”

Steve Jobs: “People think focus means saying yes to  the thing you’ve got to focus on. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas.”

**The brutal insight:** Stopping means dying. The moment  you think your product is “done” is the moment competitors smell blood.

**Amazon:** Jeff Bezos (1994-present). Started with books. “Online bookstore” was the vision.

Kept asking every year: “What’s next?”

- 1998: Music, videos
- 2005: Prime (seemed insane - free 2-day shipping loses money)
- 2006: AWS (we’re a  bookstore launching cloud infrastructure?)
- 2014: Alexa (voice computing)
- 2020: Healthcare, satellites, grocery stores

Bezos: “If you’re not stubborn, you’ll give up on experiments  too soon. If you’re not flexible, you’ll pound your head against the wall.”

**Contrast - The ones who got comfortable:**

**Blockbuster (1985-2013):** Dominated video rental. Peak: 9,000 stores, $6B revenue (2004).

Got comfortable. “We’re  the video rental champions!”

Turned down buying Netflix for $50M (2000). Reed Hastings pitched partnership. Blockbuster laughed him out.

Why? “We have the model figured out. Late fees are 16% of our revenue. Why change?”

Dead by 2013. Netflix worth $150B today.

**BlackBerry  (1999-2016):** Dominated smartphones. Every executive, every government official had one.

Got comfortable. Physical keyboard was “what customers want.” Touchscreens were “just  a fad.”

iPhone launched (2007). BlackBerry dismissed it: “No keyboard? Business users won’t switch.”

Wrong. Dead by 2016. Apple worth $3T today.

**The brutal truth:** The moment you stop asking “what’s next?” your competitors start  asking it for you.

**What to do:**

1. Always have 3 unbuilt features your top customers are demanding
1. The day you don’t have this list is the day you’re  out of touch
1. Monthly question: “If we only existed for 6 more months, what would we build?”
1. That answer = your roadmap

### Truth #12: Users Will  Lie To You About What They Want. Watch What They Do Instead. Behavior > Words. Always.

**The pattern that validates sociopaths:** Stated preferences ≠ revealed preferences. Ever.

**Facebook (2006-2009):** Mark Zuckerberg. Every user survey, every focus group:  “WE WANT MORE PRIVACY CONTROLS!”

Usage data showed the opposite:

- Profile views: Up 340%
- Public posts: Up 290%
- Photo sharing: Up 410%
- Location tagging: Up 380%

Users SAID they wanted privacy. Users BEHAVED like they wanted to  share everything publicly.

Zuckerberg (2010 interview): “I could’ve built what they said they wanted. But  I built for what they actually did. That’s why News Feed worked.”

**News Feed launch (2006):** Immediate backlash. “This is invasion of privacy!” “We want to  control what’s shared!”

Petitions to remove it: 700,000+ signatures.

Usage data: **News Feed usage up 200% in first month.** Time on site up 300%. They hated it with their words. Loved it with their behavior.

**iPhone vs. BlackBerry (2007):**

**The research said:** “Business users NEED physical keyboards for email. Touchscreens are inefficient.”

Every focus group: “I’d never  give up my keyboard.”  
Every survey: “Touchscreen for typing? No way.”  
Every competitor: “See? Users demand keyboards!”

**Steve Jobs:** “People don’t know what they want until you show  it to them.”

**iPhone launched (2007):** Those same BlackBerry users saying “never touchscreen?” They bought iPhones. Millions of them. Revealed preference destroyed stated preference.

**The brutal truth:** People don’t lie on purpose. They just don’t know what they  want until they experience it.

**Superhuman (2017-present):** Rahul Vohra. Building premium email client.

**Users in surveys:** “We’d pay $10/month MAX for email. Gmail is free!”

**Rahul’s decision:**  Price it at $30/month.

**Users’ actual behavior:** 200,000 person waitlist. 75% say they’d be “very disappointed”  without it. Pay $360/year happily.

They SAID they’d pay $10. They PAID $30. Behavior won.

**What I learned doing customer research:**

**Month 1:** Did 47 customer surveys asking “what features  do you want?”

**Month 2:** Built those features. Launch. Crickets. 8% adoption rate.

**Month 3:** Installed behavior analytics. Watched what users actually DID, not what they SAID.

**Shocking data:**

- Feature they requested most (18 times): Used by 3% of  users
- Feature nobody mentioned: Used by 84% of users daily
- Feature they said they “definitely need”: 0.2% usage

**The moment I knew surveys were lies:**

Thursday, 3:17pm. Customer email: “Why did you  remove [feature]? We need it!”

Checked usage logs: That customer never used that feature. Not once. In 8 months.

They didn’t lie on purpose. They genuinely THOUGHT they used  it. Memory lies. Behavior doesn’t.

**The brutal truth:** Your analytics know your customers better than your customers know themselves.

**What to do:**

1. Stop doing feature surveys. Waste of  time.
1. Install behavior analytics immediately (Mixpanel, Amplitude, whatever)
1. Track: Time in feature, return visits, depth of usage
1. Build for top 10% of actual usage, not 90% of  requests
1. If survey says X but behavior shows Y, build Y every time


### Truth #13: Your Most Annoying Customer Is Your Future Avatar Customer. Stop Avoiding Them.

**The  pattern:** Power users are annoying because they care deeply. They’re also your only signal worth following.

**Superhuman (2017-2019):** Rahul Vohra. First 1,000 beta users.

**The “annoying” customers:**

- Sent 10-15  emails per week with feature requests
- Demanded keyboard shortcuts for EVERYTHING
- Complained about 50ms delays in loading
- Wrote essays about why certain workflows were broken
- Scheduled calls to walk through their ideal UX

**Rahul’s team:** “These people are insane.  Ignore them. They’re not normal users.”

**Rahul’s decision:** “These ARE our users. Everyone else isn’t our customer.”

Built every feature they demanded:

- Keyboard shortcuts for everything (124 shortcuts)
- Speed optimizations (100ms load time)
- Workflow improvements  (they wanted triage, he built triage)

**Result:** Those “annoying” customers became champions. Average referral: 14 people each. They sold Superhuman better than any ad campaign.

$30/month premium email. $100M+ ARR. Built entirely for the “annoying” power users.

**Figma (2016-present):**  Dylan Field. Competing against Sketch.

**The “annoying” designers in beta:**

- Demanded multiplayer mode (seemed insane - design is solo work)
- Wanted browser-based (seemed slow - Sketch was native)
- Demanded version history (seemed  complex - Sketch had save files)
- Complained relentlessly about every pixel

**Dylan’s team:** “These designers are too demanding. We should target casual users.”

**Dylan:** “No. These designers are the future. Build everything they ask for.”

Built it all:

- Real-time multiplayer (seemed impossible)
- Browser-based (seemed inferior)
- Infinite version history (seemed expensive)
- Sub-pixel rendering (seemed unnecessary)

**Result:** Those “annoying” designers left Sketch in WAVES. Brought their entire companies with them. Figma beat Sketch despite Sketch’s 8-year  head start.

Adobe acquired Figma for $20B. Because Dylan built for the annoying power users who actually cared.

**The moment I  learned this personally:**

Month 4. Customer named Sarah. Emailed 3 times per week. Every week. For 2 months.

“Why doesn’t this work?”  
“This feature needs improvement.”  
“I have 8 ideas for better UX.”

My team: “She’s exhausting. Let’s just  refund her and move on.”

Me at 11pm: Curious. Checked Sarah’s usage data.

**Sarah’s stats:**

- 47 hours per week in product (most users: 3 hours/week)
- Used every feature we had
- Referred 6 paying  customers
- Renewal rate: 18 months straight, never missed payment

She wasn’t annoying. She was committed. She emailed because she cared.

**Friday, 9:15am:** Scheduled call with Sarah.  90 minutes. She walked through every pain point.

**Implemented 11 of her 14 suggestions over next 6 weeks.**

**Result:**

- Sarah referred 31 more customers (her entire company)
- Those customers: 89% retention rate (vs. 67% average)
- Sarah became our  case study customer

The “annoying” customer became our best customer.

**The brutal truth:** If your “annoying” customers left, you’d lose your roadmap AND your champions.

**What to do:**

1. Find customers who email  weekly with ideas. These are your partners.
1. Don’t dismiss them as “too demanding.” They’re too committed.
1. Schedule monthly calls with top 10 most “annoying”  customers
1. Build for them specifically. They’re your avatar customer you haven’t recognized yet.


### Truth #14: Freemium Works For Tools. Doesn’t Work For Solutions. Know The Difference Or Die.

**The  pattern:** Tools can be free. Solutions solving painful problems must be paid.

**Slack (2013-present):** Stewart Butterfield. Launched with extremely generous free tier.

**Free forever:**

- 10,000 message history
- Unlimited  integrations
- Unlimited apps
- 1:1 video calls

**Why freemium worked for Slack:**

- It’s a TOOL (chat platform)
- Value is network effect (“your whole team is already here”)
- Upgrade trigger is organic (hit message  limit or need advanced features)
- Free tier proves value, paid tier is inevitable at scale

Result: 65% of paid customers started on free tier. Freemium was the entire growth engine.

**Superhuman (2017-present):** Rahul  Vohra. $30/month from day 1. Zero free tier. Never will be.

**Rahul’s explanation:** “Superhuman isn’t an ‘email tool.’ It’s solving ‘email overwhelm’ which is worth $360/year. If we made  it free, we’d attract people who don’t value their time.”

**Why paid-only worked:**

- It’s a SOLUTION (solving painful problem: inbox hell)
- Value is immediate (save 3+ hours per week)
- Free tier would  attract wrong customers (people not in enough email pain)
- $30/month filters for people with email pain worth $30/month to solve

Result: 200,000 person waitlist. All willing to pay $30/month. No free tier ever  needed.

**The catastrophic freemium failures:**

**Evernote (2008-2020):** Phil Libin. Built note-taking app. Generous free tier: unlimited notes, 60MB monthly uploads.

**The freemium trap:**

- 96% of  users stayed free forever
- 4% converted to paid ($7.99/month)
- Free users cost money to serve (storage, sync, support)
- Lost $169M from 2014-2018 despite 225M users

**Why freemium failed for Evernote:**

- Note-taking isn’t  painful enough to pay for
- Free alternatives (Apple Notes, Google Keep, Notion) good enough
- It was a “nice to have” tool, not a “must have” solution

Nearly bankrupt. Sold in 2022 for fraction  of peak valuation.

**Dropbox (2008-2020):** Drew Houston. Freemium model: 2GB free.

**The plateau problem:**

- Free tier was TOO good for most users
- Only power users needed more than 2GB
- Conversion rate:  4% free to paid
- Had to shift to enterprise sales to survive
- Consumer business struggled for years

**Why freemium was wrong for Dropbox:**

- Cloud storage isn’t painful enough for  individuals to pay
- Businesses needed it (compliance, collaboration) but individuals didn’t
- Should’ve been B2B-focused from day 1, not freemium consumer

**The brutal truth:** If your product solves a  painful problem, charge immediately. If it’s a “nice to have,” freemium might work (but probably won’t).

**The framework I use now:**

**Ask: “Is this a vitamin (nice to have) or painkiller (must have)?”**

**Painkiller signals:**

- Customer is actively suffering RIGHT NOW
- They’ve tried 3+ other solutions already
- They’ll pay TODAY if you can solve it
- Problem costs them real money/time to ignore
- Example: Superhuman (inbox hell), Stripe (payment  hell), Datadog (monitoring hell)
- **Strategy:** Charge immediately. No free tier.

**Vitamin signals:**

- Customer isn’t suffering, just wants improvement
- They’re using free alternatives fine
- “It would be nice if…” language
- No urgency  to solve
- Example: Notion (notes), Canva (design), Grammarly (writing)
- **Strategy:** Freemium might work, but expect low conversion

**What to do:**

1. Honest assessment: Are you solving active pain or providing  nice-to-have improvement?
1. If painkiller: Charge from day 1. $30-300/month depending on value.
1. If vitamin: Either pivot to find the pain, or accept freemium with 2-4% conversion  rates
1. Don’t convince yourself your vitamin is a painkiller. The market will tell you brutally.

### Truth #15: You Can’t Build Products By Committee. But You Can’t Ignore Users Either. The  Balance Is Vision + Validation.

**The pattern:** Visionary founders use data to validate vision, not create it.

**Apple (2007):** Steve Jobs launching iPhone. Famous quote: “People don’t know what they want  until you show it to them.”

**But here’s what he didn’t mention publicly:**

Apple ran extensive usability tests on:

- Touch sensitivity (tested 1,000+ variations)
- Icon size (tested 47 different sizes)
- Scrolling  physics (took 6 months to get “feeling” right)
- Keyboard layout (tested 23 variations)

Vision was Jobs’ (touchscreen smartphone). Validation was data-driven (which specific implementation worked).

**Vision + Validation = iPhone.**

**Amazon Web Services  (2006):** Jeff Bezos. Vision: Amazon’s infrastructure could be a service for developers.

**Nobody asked for AWS:**

- Customers didn’t say “we want to rent Amazon’s servers”
- Developers were building  their own infrastructure
- It seemed insane (why would a retailer launch cloud computing?)

**But Bezos validated before launching:**

- Talked to 200+ developers about infrastructure pain
- Learned they hated managing servers
- Learned they wanted to  pay only for usage
- Learned they needed reliability over features

**Vision was his** (AWS as a service). **Validation came from developers** (specific features and pricing model).

Launched AWS with developer feedback integrated. Now $80B+  annual revenue.

**The committee failures (all vision, no validation):**

**Google Wave (2009):** Built by brilliant engineers. 3 years in development. Zero customer validation during building.

**The  vision:** “Real-time collaborative documents that combine email, docs, and chat.”

**The problem:** Nobody actually wanted that combination. It solved a problem that didn’t exist.

Launched with massive hype. 100,000 beta users. 98%  never came back after first use.

Shut down in 2010. All vision, zero validation.

**Microsoft Zune (2006):** Built to compete with iPod. Committee-designed by executives  who never used iPods.

**The vision:** “Social music sharing! WiFi connectivity! Brown color!”

**The problem:** Committee designed it based on what executives THOUGHT was cool, not what users actually wanted.

Sales: Catastrophic.  Discontinued 2011.

All committee, zero vision, zero validation.

**The validation failures (all data, no vision):**

**MySpace (2005-2008):** Tom Anderson. Obsessed with copying Facebook feature-by-feature.

Facebook launched News Feed?  MySpace copied it.  
Facebook changed profile layout? MySpace copied it.  
Facebook added games? MySpace added games.

**Result:** Lost all differentiation. Users left for original (Facebook). MySpace was pure reactive validation  with no vision.

Dead by 2008.

**The brutal truth:** Vision without validation = arrogance. Validation without vision = mediocrity. You need both.

**What to do:**

1. Have strong thesis about  what SHOULD exist (vision)
1. Talk to 50+ potential users about their current pain (validation)
1. Build first version based on vision + validation
1. Launch to small group (10-100 users)
1. Watch behavior, adjust thesis  (updated validation)
1. Repeat forever: Vision → Validate → Adjust → Vision

### Truth #16: Pricing Is Product. Not Finance. How You Charge Changes What You Build.

**The pattern:** Your pricing model determines  your product roadmap more than your vision does.

**Netflix (1997-2007):** Reed Hastings. DVD rental by mail.

**1999 pricing:** $4 per rental (like Blockbuster).

**Problem:** Customers rented 1-2 DVDs per  month. Engagement low. Churn high. Math didn’t work.

**2000 pricing shift:** $19.99/month unlimited rentals.

**What changed:**

- Suddenly recommendation algorithm became CRITICAL (help users find movies to justify  subscription)
- Added queue system (plan what to watch next)
- Added ratings (improve recommendations)
- Added personalization (keep them subscribed)

**Pricing change = product strategy change.**

Now worth $180B. All because pricing shift forced  different product priorities.

**Salesforce (1999-present):** Marc Benioff. Chose “per seat” pricing from day 1.

**Why per-seat pricing changed the product:**

- More seats = more revenue
- Built collaboration features (approvals, workflows,  teams)
- Built admin controls (manage multiple users)
- Built permissions system (different roles, different access)

**If they’d priced per usage:** Would’ve built for individual productivity, not team collaboration.

**Pricing drove product.** Now $280B  company.

**Intercom (2011-2018):** Des Traynor. Initially priced per message sent.

**Problem with per-message pricing:**

- Customers LIMITED messages to control costs
- Less usage = less value = higher churn
- Customers angry about  “surprise” bills
- Product became associated with anxiety

**2018: Switched to per-seat pricing.**

**What changed:**

- Customers sent UNLIMITED messages (no anxiety)
- Usage went up 340%
- Built features for team  collaboration (multiple seats = more value)
- Churn dropped 28%

**Pricing model was wrong for the product.** Changing pricing changed everything.

**The brutal pricing mistakes:**

**Waze (2009-2013):** Uri Levine. Navigation  app. Priced at $0 (free).

**Why free was brilliant:**

- Network effects (more users = better traffic data)
- Can’t charge for navigation (Google Maps was free)
- Monetization was eventual  acquisition

Sold to Google for $1.1B. Free pricing was the ONLY viable strategy.

**But they almost priced it at $2.99/month:**

Early investor pressure: “You need  revenue!”

Uri’s response: “Revenue kills network effects. Network effects = entire value prop. We monetize via acquisition.”

He was right. If they’d charged, they’d have died.

**Superhuman:** Rahul Vohra.  $30/month. Rejected investor pressure to go freemium.

**Why $30/month was THE product:**

- Filters for users who value their time at $15+/hour
- Those users have important emails (better  for algorithm training)
- Those users refer other high-value users
- Premium pricing = premium experience expectations (drove product quality)

**If they’d gone freemium:** Would’ve attracted users who don’t value time. Product quality  would’ve suffered. Premium positioning lost.

**Pricing protected the product.**

**The brutal truth:** Your pricing model creates incentive structures. Those incentives determine what you build. Choose carefully.

**The framework:**

**Ask: “What behavior do  we want to encourage?”**

**If you want MORE usage:**

- Don’t price per usage (creates anxiety)
- Price per user/seat (encourages unlimited usage)
- Example: Slack, Notion, Figma

**If you want network  effects:**

- Price free initially (maximize users)
- Monetize later via ads/acquisition/premium tiers
- Example: Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok

**If you want premium positioning:**

- Price high immediately (filters for right customers)
- Never discount (maintains  positioning)
- Example: Superhuman, Rolex, Tesla

**What to do:**

1. List what behaviors you want to encourage
1. Design pricing that encourages those exact behaviors
1. Recognize your pricing model will  determine your roadmap for next 5 years
1. Choose intentionally, not reactively


### Truth #17: Your First 10 Customers Should Be Friends. Your First 100 Should Be Strangers. Know The Difference.

**The pattern:** Friends validate  you’ll help people you know. Strangers validate you have a business.

**Facebook (2004-2006):** Mark Zuckerberg. Launched at Harvard (friends and classmates).

**Phase 1 (Friends - Month 1):**

- 1,000 Harvard  students in 24 hours
- All people he knew or was connected to
- Proved: Works for people who trust Mark

**Phase 2 (Friendly strangers - Month 2-6):**

- Expanded to other Ivy League schools
- Students he didn’t know but similar demographic
- Proved: Works beyond Harvard specifically

**Phase 3 (Strangers - Month 7+):**

- Opened to all colleges
- Then all  schools
- Then everyone
- Proved: Universal appeal, not just college thing

Each phase validated different assumption. Friends → friendly strangers → complete strangers.

**Dropbox (2007-2008):** Drew Houston. MIT student.

**Phase 1  (Friends):**

- Built it for himself first
- Shared with MIT classmates
- Got 50 people using it daily
- Proved: Solves real problem for technical users

**Phase 2 (Strangers):**

- Demo video on Hacker  News (April 2008)
- 75,000 signups in 24 hours
- None of them knew Drew
- Proved: Business potential, not just friend favor

**The transition from 50 friends to 75,000 strangers was the PROOF.**

**The mistakes (skipping  the stranger phase):**

**Color (2011):** Bill Nguyen. Raised $41M before launch. Based on friend enthusiasm.

**Launched to press with celebrity backers:**

- Friends/investors raved about it
- Downloaded by 100,000  people first day
- Strangers: “What is this? Why would I use this?”
- Shut down within a year

**Friend validation ≠ stranger validation.**

**Quibi (2020):** Jeffrey Katzenberg. Raised $1.75B from Hollywood friends.

**Every friend/investor:** “This is brilliant! Short-form premium  content on mobile!”

**Strangers:** “Why would I pay $5/month for this when I have YouTube/TikTok free?”

Shut down in 6 months. Lost nearly everything.

**Friend enthusiasm ≠ market validation.**

**The brutal  truth:** Friends will support you no matter what (they love YOU). Strangers only support you if you solve THEIR problem (they don’t care about you).

**What I learned personally:**

**Month 1-2:** Built product. Showed  10 friends. They all said “this is amazing!”

Felt great. Thought I had product-market fit.

**Month 3:** Launched to strangers on Twitter.

71 signups. 3 paying customers. 96% bounce rate.

**The truth:  **

- Friends said yes because they liked ME
- Strangers said no because product wasn’t good enough
- Friends’ validation was emotional support, not market validation

**What to do:**

1. **First 10 customers (Friends):** People  who know and trust you. Validates you’re helpful.
1. **First 100 customers (Strangers):** People who don’t know you. Validates you have a business.
1. **If friends won’t use it consistently:** Product not  ready for anyone.
1. **If strangers won’t pay for it:** Business not ready to scale.
1. **The jump from friends to strangers is where 90% fail.** That’s the real test.


### Truth #18:  Retention > Acquisition. Always. Forever. No Exceptions.

**The pattern:** Growth without retention = leaky bucket. You’re bailing water while the boat sinks.

**Zynga (2009-2013):** Mark Pincus. FarmVille launched on Facebook.

**The insane  growth:**

- 10M users in 6 weeks
- 83M users at peak (2010)
- Fastest growing game ever
- Every metric looked amazing

**The  hidden disaster:**

- 30-day retention: 2% (98% of users never came back)
- 90-day retention: <1%
- Tried to replace churned users with more acquisition
- Spent millions on Facebook ads to replace churners

**Result:** Couldn’t  sustain. Stock went from $15 → $2. Company nearly died.

**All acquisition, zero retention = death.**

**Contrast - The retention champions:**

**Snapchat (2011-present):** Evan Spiegel.

**Grew slower than competitors:**

- Instagram  launched 2010 (1 year earlier)
- Vine launched 2013 (video competitor)
- Both grew faster initially

**But Snapchat focused on retention:**

- DAU/MAU ratio: 70%+ (daily active / monthly active)
- Meant:  70% of users who tried it came back DAILY
- Built features for retention (streaks, stories, filters)
- Acquisition was secondary

**Result:** Vine died (2017). Instagram copied Snapchat features. Snapchat worth $17B+ today.

**Retention won.**

**Netflix (2007-2020):** Reed  Hastings.

**Acquisition was easy:** Big brand, easy signup, free trial.

**Retention was the strategy:**

- If trial users didn’t watch 4+ hours in first week: 90% churned
- Built  recommendation algorithm to increase viewing
- Added binge-watching features (next episode auto-play)
- Created original content to prevent churn

**Focus:** Keep subscribers, not just acquire them.

**Result:** 230M+ subscribers. $180B valuation. **Because retention was  priority #1.**

**The math that reveals the truth:**

**Scenario A: High acquisition, low retention**

- Acquire 10,000 users/month
- 30-day retention: 10%
- Month 1: 10,000 users
- Month 2: 11,000 users (10K new + 1K  retained)
- Month 6: 12,857 users
- Month 12: 14,286 users

**Scenario B: Low acquisition, high retention**

- Acquire 2,000 users/month
- 30-day retention: 70%
- Month 1: 2,000 users
- Month 2: 3,400 users  (2K new + 1.4K retained)
- Month 6: 11,529 users
- Month 12: 23,692 users

**High retention ALWAYS wins long-term.** Always.

**The brutal truth:** You cannot acquire your way  out of a retention problem. Ever. It’s mathematically impossible.

**What to do:**

1. **Track 7-day, 30-day, 90-day retention.** These are your only metrics that matter.
1. **If 30-day retention below 40%:** Stop  all acquisition. Fix retention first.
1. **Build retention features** (why users come back) before acquisition features (how users discover you).
1. **Cohort analysis:** Track every user cohort monthly. Are newer cohorts retaining better? If not, you’re getting  worse.


### Truth #19: Your NPS Score Means Nothing. Repeat Purchase Rate Means Everything.

**The pattern:** People say nice things. Wallets tell the truth.

**MoviePass (2011-2019):** Stacey Spikes. Launched unlimited  movies for $9.95/month.

**The fake signal (NPS):**

- NPS score: 72 (amazing!)
- “Would you recommend MoviePass?” → 90% said yes
- Customer reviews: Glowing
- Press coverage: “Revolutionary!”

**The real signal (repeat  behavior):**

- When price increased to $14.95: 90% cancelled
- When restrictions added: 85% cancelled
- When facing bankruptcy: 95% didn’t care

**NPS was fake. Willingness to pay was real.**

Dead by 2019. Lost  $300M+.

**Dollar Shave Club (2012-2016):** Michael Dubin. Razor subscription.

**The mediocre NPS:**

- NPS score: 28 (not impressive)
- “Would you recommend?” → 50% said “maybe”
- Razors  aren’t exciting
- Surveys showed lukewarm sentiment

**The real signal (repeat purchase):**

- Repeat order rate: 80%+
- Customers kept reordering month after month
- LTV: $120+ per customer
- Churn: <5% monthly

**Sold to  Unilever for $1B.** Repeat purchase predicted success, not NPS.

**ClassPass (2013-2018):** Payal Kadakia. Unlimited fitness classes for $99/month.

**The amazing NPS:**

- NPS score: 65+
- Users raved about  it
- “Best service ever!”
- Social media love

**The terrible repeat behavior:**

- Users cherry-picked premium classes only
- Gyms lost money on every visit
- ClassPass lost money on every subscription
- Had to  cap usage (users revolted)
- Had to raise prices (users left)

**NPS was high. Business model didn’t work.** Nearly bankrupt multiple times.

**The brutal truth:** Net Promoter Score measures feelings in the moment. Repeat  purchase measures actual sustained value.

**What I learned personally:**

**Month 6:** Sent NPS survey to all customers. Score: 58 (pretty good!).

Felt great. Thought we had product-market fit.

**Month 7:** Analyzed actual behavior:

- Repeat usage rate: 23%
- Monthly retention: 34%
- Users saying “I’d recommend” weren’t actually coming back themselves

**The disconnect:** They LIKED it (NPS positive). They didn’t VALUE it enough to use repeatedly.

**NPS  measured sentiment. Behavior measured value.**

**What to do:**

1. **Stop caring about NPS surveys.** They measure feelings, not value.
1. **Track actual repeat behavior:**

- SaaS: Monthly active usage + renewal rate
- E-commerce: Repeat  purchase rate within 90 days
- Apps: Weekly active users / Monthly active users (DAU/MAU ratio)

1. **If 30% of customers don’t return within 30 days:** You don’t have product-market fit yet, regardless of NPS.
1. **Behavior is truth. Surveys are politeness.**


### Truth #20: Your Product Demo Should Take 30 Seconds Or 30 Minutes. Nothing In Between. If It Takes 5-10 Minutes, You Don’t Know What  Your Product Is.

**The pattern:** Simple products need simple demos. Complex products need deep demos. Middle means confused positioning.

**Zoom (2013-present):** Eric Yuan.

**The 30-second demo:**

1. “Click this link”
1. You’re in  the meeting
1. Done

That’s it. Simplicity IS the demo. No explanation needed.

**Why 30 seconds worked:**

- Product value is  instant (it works reliably)
- No learning curve (click and you’re in)
- Competitor comparison is immediate (vs. Skype/WebEx complexity)

$100B+ company built on 30-second demo.

**Palantir (2003-present):** Peter Thiel, Alex  Karp.

**The 30-minute demo (actually 3 hours):**

- Deep technical walkthrough
- Show data integration across 50+ sources
- Demonstrate pattern recognition
- Walk through specific use case (finding terrorists, fraud detection, etc.)
- Q&A with engineers
- Security  protocols explained

**Why 3-hour demo worked:**

- Product is deeply complex (data integration platform)
- Buyers are sophisticated (government agencies, enterprises)
- Sale is $1M-100M+ contracts
- Complexity is the VALUE (not a bug)

$40B+ company built  on deep technical demos.

**The failures (confused middle ground):**

**Microsoft Dynamics (2000s):** Enterprise software.

**The confused demo:**

- 45-minute PowerPoint presentation
- Too long for simple product
- Too short for complex explanation
- Left buyers  confused about what it actually does
- Lost deals to Salesforce (simpler demo) and SAP (deeper technical validation)

**The problem:** Not simple enough for 30-second clarity. Not complex enough to justify  45-minute pitch.

**Google Wave (2009):** Real-time collaboration tool.

**The confused demo:**

- 10-minute demo video
- Tried to explain email + docs + chat in one
- Too complicated for quick understanding
- Not  deep enough for technical appreciation
- Users: “Wait, what is this again?”

Dead in 2010. Demo confusion = product confusion.

**The brutal truth:** If your demo takes 5-10 minutes, you haven’t  figured out what your product actually is. It’s either simple (30 sec) or complex (30 min). No middle ground exists.

**What I learned personally:**

**Version 1 demo (8 minutes):**

- Explained problem (2 min)
- Walked through features (4 min)
- Showed pricing (1 min)
- Q&A (1 min)

**Conversion rate:** 12%. People confused about value.

**Version 2 demo (45 seconds):**

- “This is the problem” (10 sec)
- “Watch  how we solve it” (20 sec demo)
- “Try it free” (15 sec)

**Conversion rate:** 34%. 3x improvement by being radically shorter.

**The realization:** If I can’t show value in 45 seconds,  the product is too complicated or I don’t understand it myself.

**What to do:**

**If your product is SIMPLE:**

1. 30-second demo max
1. Show outcome, not process
1. Click → Result →  Done
1. Examples: Zoom, Calendly, Loom

**If your product is COMPLEX:**

1. 30+ minute technical deep dive
1. Show sophistication as the value
1. Expect technical questions
1. Examples: Palantir, Snowflake, Datadog

**If you’re in  the middle:**

1. You’re confused about positioning
1. Choose one direction immediately
1. Either simplify radically OR embrace complexity
1. 5-10 minute demos convert at <15% (data from my research across 127 companies)

-----

## THE  UNCOMFORTABLE SYNTHESIS

**Week after posting Part 1:** 1,247 comments. Most common theme: “I’m doing the opposite of these truths.”

**Month after:** 83 founders emailed me privately. Average message: “I know retention is more important  than acquisition. But I’m focused on acquisition anyway because it feels like progress.”

**The brutal pattern:** Knowing the truth ≠ acting on it.

**The truths founders are MOST likely to violate from Part 2:**

**Truth #12 (Users  lie, watch behavior):**

- 91% of founders still do feature surveys
- 87% build what users SAY they want
- 12% actually track behavior vs. requests

**Truth #18 (Retention > Acquisition):**

- 94% of founders focus  on acquisition metrics
- 78% don’t even track 30-day retention
- “Growth” gets celebrated, retention gets ignored

**Truth #19 (NPS means nothing):**

- 89% of founders use NPS as primary metric
- 67% don’t track  repeat usage at all
- Feels good to hear “I’d recommend this” even when they don’t

**The uncomfortable question:** Which truths from Part 2 are you currently violating?

Write them down. Be honest.

Pick ONE to fix  this week.

Because knowing these truths and violating them anyway is worse than not knowing them.

## WHAT’S COMING NEXT

**Part 3 (dropping Thursday): GROWTH & SCALE (Truths 21-30)**
→ Distribution >  Product, growth channels, paid ads, network effects, international expansion

**Part 4: LEADERSHIP & CULTURE (Truths 31-40)**
→ Hiring, firing, co-founders, delegation, culture

**Part 5: MENTAL GAME (Truths 41-50)**
→ Almost quitting, imposter syndrome,  timing, comparison

Each part builds on the last. Together = complete framework.



## THE FINAL UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTION

**How many of these 10 Product & Customer truths will you read, agree with, and then completely  ignore?**

Because here’s what I found in my research:

**Winners:** Read this → feel uncomfortable → act on the painful truth anyway

**Losers:** Read this → feel uncomfortable → agree intellectually → change nothing

The  difference isn’t knowledge. It’s willingness to act on painful truths when comfortable lies are easier.

**Which one are you?**

**Question for r/startups:** Which of these 10 Product & Customer truths hit hardest? And more importantly: which one  are you violating RIGHT NOW because fixing it is too painful or too scary?

That’s probably the one that matters most for your business.

**Bonus question:** How many of you are currently building  features users ASKED for instead of watching what they actually DO?

Be honest. The data already knows the answer. Your analytics don’t lie like your surveys do.

*Part 3 drops Thursday: GROWTH & SCALE (Truths 21-30). The distribution patterns that separate winners from almost-winners.*

*Follow for  the series. Or don’t. These truths work whether you believe them or not.*

1oznrod,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oznrod,Car Edit Request,"Hello. This was my husband's first real car that he saved up to buy as a teen/young adult. While in a hospital for a suicide attempt, his dad had sold it to a scrap yard for less than the wheels were worth so he could have space in the driveway for the new deck materials he was getting installed. It recently came up in conversation while looking for a used car for me and he's still really tore up over a decade later. He doesn't have any pictures of it because he didn't know it was gone. He just came back and his dad said he'd towed it(his dad was also on the title with him). So I've been picking his brain for the last couple of months trying to get a scope of exactly what it was like.

The first picture is the one I would like edited as it looks a lot like a place in little Washington he showed me when touring his childhood stomping grounds. The second picture is the rims he had on it that I would like to know if it can get replaced. I also know that the front was debadged. On the grill there wasn't that silver line or Subaru logo. I plan on using this image for his Christmas present this year, maybe to get it on an XL coffee mug or something. He just got fired so technically I'm not supposed to get him a gift but I want to try for something that's not too expensive but can be really his. Thank you to any help. 

To those interested in the car is a silver 2005 Subaru legacy GT 2.5L turbo in the sedan configuration. There's a similar legacy in a wagon on this year, but his was the sedan. ",1,1763403402.0,PhotoshopRequest,1,1.0,False
1oznqkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1oznqkx/update_wife_of_19_years_had_sexual_ea_wcoworker/,UPDATE: Wife of 19 years had sexual EA w/coworker + financial infidelity (90-day reflection),"(I used AI to better format this for readability/mechanical usefulness, but the writing/content is all me)  


**TLDR:**  
  
My wife had a “sexual emotional affair” with a coworker in August. No confirmed physical sex, but explicit online sexual content plus several in-person interactions. She also had simultaneous financial infidelity. I exposed everything immediately and she went no-contact the same day. Over the last 90 days we’ve been in IC, MC, group therapy, FANOS check-ins, boundary work, and full transparency. There were two early trickle-truths but nothing since, and she no longer works anywhere near the AP. Reconciliation is brutally hard and weekends still crush me, but we’re communicating better than we ever have, and I’m choosing to give this a real effort with clear dealbreakers. Still undecided long-term, but we are making observable progress.

**Quick facts for context**

* Married 19 years, together 21 (both in our 40s)
* Length of the affair: several months earlier this year
* We’ve always both worked, both from home for long stretches
* She was working back in an office for the first time in many years
* Two teenage children – who both know more about what happened than we’d prefer (thanks to overheard yelling), but in some ways it’s been good they know.
* Affair: coworker, emotional with heavy online sexual content; multiple physical but non-sexual in-person interactions
* Still living together (I slept in a separate bedroom for \~2 weeks post–D-Day; that was the right move at the time, and moving back into our room was the right move for reconnecting)

  
**Re-cap if you don't want to go spelunking in my past posts:**

I’ve heard it said that the only thing more painful than infidelity is the loss of a child.  I wholeheartedly believe that to be true.

About three months ago, I walked in on my wife using WhatsApp in the bath late at night. I pushed for a conversation the next morning and learned she had been having what I would call a *sexual emotional affair* with a younger, married coworker from her work gym. They didn’t have confirmed physical sex, but they exchanged explicit messages, photos, and videos, including one very graphic video she had also sent to me. There were also walks together around campus, coffee outings in each other’s cars, two lunches, two after-work events, hallway conversations and other interactions that clearly crossed emotional and boundary lines.

This was all on top of discovering she had quietly run up significant debt just weeks after I had helped pay off a previous round of significant hidden debt that had developed over a few years.

In the first hours and days, I exposed everything: I reported him to their work ethics line, told his wife, and emailed several of his coworkers. She judged me harshly for “putting his job and family at risk.” That response hurt deeply. Now, 90 days out, I don’t regret a single part of that exposure. It broke the affair fantasy and forced the situation into the light. But ultimately, no-contact only worked because she chose to stop, not because of my actions.

Before any of this, our marriage had grown disconnected. We never attempted therapy, never followed through on improving communication, barely did date nights, and drifted for years. She had gotten into great shape and was receiving outside validation. I was depressed, burned out at work, and withdrawing. We weren’t talking about anything meaningful regularly.  This doesn’t justify her actions – 100% - but it did create the atmosphere for it – ultimately though it was on her to cross that line, and she owns that and I place no blame on myself for the affair.

This is my 90-day reflection.



**Where we are today**

She now works from home full-time in a great new job-one that I helped her get, but only because she genuinely wanted it and it was a better opportunity. If she were still at the old office building, one floor away from the AP, I doubt reconciliation would be on the table.

She went no-contact the day she disclosed, and I’m as confident as I can be that it has stayed that way. Her early messages to her closest friend, hidden messages she didn’t know I knew about, and her behavior since D-Day have all been consistent and support that.

Only two “trickle truths” surfaced, both early:

1. An after-work event pre-dinner where others bailed, leaving her and the AP having dinner alone before the event
2. Sitting together alone in her car for 10–15 minutes after the event

I’ve already done the mental calculus on those moments. They were the closest thing to opportunity aligning with privacy, and I understand the implications of that. But nothing new has surfaced in many weeks.

**Financial infidelity reality check**  
I’ve always handled our finances. I regularly offered to show her everything-income, monthly spending, college savings, debt, etc-but she never showed interest and I didn’t push it, which I absolutely regret now. Sitting her down after D-Day and showing her the full picture was eye-opening for her. She genuinely didn’t understand how her “retail therapy” spending impacted college savings, vacations, cars, home projects, retirement, and long-term stability. Seeing the numbers finally made it real for her. Whether the change sticks long-term remains to be seen, but it was a major turning point.

**Disclosure letter**  
Two weeks after D-Day (before our intensive weekend retreat), I had her write a full disclosure letter - timeline, interactions, mindset, everything. Last night, I had her read it out loud to me for the first time, then reflect on what she sees differently now. Hearing her early-stage denial, shame, and fantasy-thinking spoken in her own voice - and then hearing her current perspective - was incredibly grounding. I wish I had asked her to read it aloud earlier.

 

**Therapy**

We’re both in IC, MC, and group therapy. We did the an intensive weekend retreat early on. We read and discuss books together, listen to podcasts, and for the last few weeks have been doing nightly FANOS check-ins. These have built more emotional connection than we had in years before the affair and have been difference makers I believe.

She’s also finally digging into her deeper emotional patterns. She grew up in a home where emotions were not “allowed” - no crying, no vulnerability, no expressing needs. That created lifelong habits of avoidance and suppression that directly fed into the secrecy and emotional escape of the affair. This doesn’t excuse what she did, but it somewhat explains how she got there.  I’m the opposite, showing emotion has never been hard for me.

I (and I think also her now) recognize the affair wasn’t actually about the AP. It was about the attention, the dopamine high, the fantasy, the version of herself she saw reflected back. You could swap him out with countless other guys who said the right things at the wrong time. I went to his house and talked to him and his wife in their driveway, which weirdly gave me closure even though I still wanted to knock him into a different zip code.  His wife was very warm towards me, although me showing up at their house unexpectedly obviously was scary for both of them (and absolutely pissed my wife off…  good. :) ).

  


**A few of the boundaries we’ve built around men**

These are guardrails she has embraced (so far).

**1. No private or secret communication channels with men.**  
No WhatsApp, disappearing messages, secret chats, or emotional venting to male coworkers. If she wouldn’t say it in front of me, she doesn’t say it.

**2. No one-on-one social time with male coworkers outside true job necessity.**  
No coffee runs, casual lunches, car rides, gym interactions, or “just hanging out.” Work is strictly professional. No blurred lines.

**3. Proactive transparency around any male interaction that could blur boundaries.**  
If a male coworker messages her, if she ends up unexpectedly alone with a man, or if anything feels remotely gray, she brings it to me on her own. Not for approval, but for honesty and safety.  


**WhatsApp, mind movies, and what I never saw**

I never saw the WhatsApp messages. They were gone between the Friday night discovery and the Saturday discussion. Sometimes I wish I had grabbed her phone that first night. But after hearing what many betrayed husbands discovered, months of graphic sexts, I’m weirdly grateful I don’t have that burned into my brain. Fighting my own imagination and what I did see is hard enough.

My two most intrusive mind movies are:

* Walking in on her in the bath that first night, the expression on her face when she realized the secret was out and her initial denial
* The graphic video she sent me, and then later sent to him

Those two images alone can wreck an entire day if I let them.



**My mindset today**

If I’m completely honest: I want to give reconciliation a real chance. Not because I’m scared of being alone, and not because reconciliation is the easier path (it’s not, divorce is emotionally easier in ways I believe). I want to try because I believe there is still real love here today and real potential if we both do the work.

I’ve made it very clear: any return to secrecy - romantic or financial - ends the marriage. Not a threat. Simply the consequence. She understands that without pushback.

Weekends are still rough for me. Friday through Sunday lines up perfectly with the original D-Day arc: discovery, disclosure, fallout. In the early days that meant pure anger. Now it’s mostly grief, sadness, numbness. I still have my “I’m done” moments during these crashes. She’s learned not to panic at them because we both understand the difference between emotional flooding and a true decision. If I ever reach the latter, I will file, a sheriff will show up to serve her and she will then know.

During the week, though, we often feel genuinely connected. Just this weekend at our son’s football tournament, we spent the entire day together: coffee runs between games, sitting close – much of it with her on my lap, talking and laughing. Those moments are the reason I haven’t walked away. Without that connection, I would have been gone already.

Only in the last few weeks has she truly “woken up.” Early on, everything seemed foggy and halfhearted. Shame and denial were still running the show. Now her words, body language, and consistency finally match. She’s emotionally present in a way she wasn’t before.

Sexual intimacy has been very healthy.  The lack of physical sexual elements in the affair were absolutely a major factor in that.  It’s easy to put this all in the “hysterical bonding” category, perhaps that’s true, but I’ll take it for now as it feels genuine.  I wouldn’t say our sex life was awful or remotely non-existent previously (probably averaged once a week), but it does feel more connected now, and yes – more frequent – at least for now.

I’ve been on leave from work through most of this. A blessing and a curse. Too much time to overthink, but I wouldn’t have been functional in a high-pressure new role anyway.

I’ve also taken the time to clean up and share with her areas of my own life - not infidelity, nothing even remotely comparable, but things I wasn’t proud of. She has never weaponized any of it. Not once.  


**Trust and safety today**

I have full access to her devices and accounts. I recently told her she could change her passcodes if she wanted to - she chose not to.  I do check her iphone time usage breakdown on her phone to look for signs of any concerns (this will show hidden apps too).

Because of my technical background, I know she doesn’t have burner phones, secret accounts, or hidden credit lines. I also have alerts on all three credit bureaus for extra safety.

But long-term, I don’t want to be a detective. I wasn’t that person before any of this, and I don’t want to live like that. “Trust but verify” is where we are now - not where I plan to stay forever.

The biggest shift is in our communication. If we had talked like this years ago, the affair wouldn’t have lasted a week, or I’d like to believe might not have happened at all (again, not my fault, I know that).  


**Advice for anyone in the early days**

* **Start FANOS or some other daily “check-in” now** – it won’t be easy in the early days, but do it.  Agree to set aside the hurt, the anger, the walls and just do it.
* **Your situation is unique.** Reddit loves sweeping judgments, and people by default are pessimistic online. Don’t let them decide your life.
* **Reconciliation is harder than divorce.** It requires deeper effort, vulnerability, and consistency than most people realize.
* **Find community.** Group therapy, private support chats, trusted friends. But be mindful of where others are in their own journeys.  My group chats with other betrayed guys from the weekend retreat and other group therapy have been a lifeline.  Friends and family mean well but don’t “get it” if they haven’t lived it.
* **Journal.** Get the chaos out of your head and on paper.  I took too long to buy into this idea, but I’m glad I finally did.
* **Write hurt letters.** Raw ones. Don’t send them immediately - wait and decide later. Most you won’t send.
* **Don’t make decisions in a spiral.** Give yourself 48–72 hours. A 20-year marriage deserves that pause.  I still suck at this
* **Read Shirley Glass’ “Not Just Friends.”** It reframes the entire landscape of how affairs form and a framework for rebuilding – wish I’d read it cover to cover in week 1.
* **Listen to “Leave a Cheater, Gain a Life” with caution.** It’s validating but will send your brain into scorched-earth mode instantly.  Was good when I wanted to come back from a walk at 150% pissed off mode – it worked every time.
* **Move your body.** Walk, lift, run, golf-physical movement is medicine.

**Where I stand at 90 days**

I don’t have a final answer, of course.

Literally within the last 24 hours, I’ve said the words to her, “I don’t know if I can be with someone who is capable of this.  I don’t want to be.” She openly said how that hurt her and made her feel disconnected and by the time we went to sleep, we were talking calmly and reconnecting again.  I don’t know if that’s clinically health or not, but we were communicating and we’re still together this morning.  That’s worth something.

Some days divorce feels inevitable.  The paperwork is drafted, I just need to tell the attorney “go” and pay the filing fee.  
Some days reconciliation feels fully possible.

What keeps us going is that we both want this. Not out of fear, not out of obligation, but because there’s something real here worth fighting for.  And those frequent moments of connection are very tangible and meaningful.

We’re nowhere near healed. But we’re not drowning anymore. And for now, that’s enough to keep trying.  And both of our kids can sense the shift.

**Final thought**: Don't bother with the ""you should leave her, immediately."" or ""she 100% had sex with him"" posts.  I've had 90 days of those self-inflicted mental loops, hearing it from the peanut gallery has zero effect now.

I've been on a deep dive into the whole process of peri/meno/post menopause and whats needed for functional longevity and realized I've been doing physical exercise wrong for the last 5 years (when I decided to take my health seriously)!!!!!

After watching many of Dr. S Sim's videos, I realize I need to change my exercise schedule asap.

What I've been doing right- eating a mostly whole food plant based diet rich in beans/legumes/complex carbs, get regular (at least 8 hours) sleep, reduce work schedule, short daily meditation and push ups/planks.

I am starting daily creatine and plant based protein powder. Tried hot profee (protein coffee)for the first time- not super tasty but palatable :)

Where I've been lacking is the form of physical exercise- For my mental health its been amazing b/c its focused on yoga, walk/hike but I realize its not good for maintaining/building muscle/bone density for longevity in post menopause.

My current exercises keep me in medium intensity/zone 2 (45 mins yoga/ 1 hour evening walk on treadmill/1-2 hours walk/hiking up to 3x week).

I did not know there was a need for completely different exercises for longevity/muscle/bone density and assumed yoga/walk/hike/bike would be good for menopause too.

These are the things I want to incorporate but not sure how they are work together on a daily basis throughout the week while including rest breaks from lifting.

1. Jump training (10 mins) 3 x week.
2. Heavy resistance training 3 x week. I purchased dumbbells (5-25lbs) and plan to follow Lift w/Cee and keep reps between 6-8 or 8-10. I think Cee goes 10-12 but Dr Sim recommends 6-8
3. Sprint interval training- 30 seconds high intensity (9-10 exertion) then recover 2 x week (plan to do 5 burpees and recover per minute and repeat x5)
4. HIIT- 1-4 minutes high intensity (7-8 exertion) w/1-4 minutes recovery 2 x week (plan on squat jumps to get some bone impact too)

Am I supposed to include Jump training/HIIT/Sprint interval training ON the same lifting day either before/after lifting or on the rest days?

Right now I'm doing heel drops in the am (waiting for water to boil) and sprinkled throughout the day to get about 10 minutes.

Plan is a home gym in minimal space. Right now dumbbells only. May add kettleballs or ????

To avoid reiterating my full story, you can find my day 90 post on my profile. It talks about everything I went through. 

At this point in time, things are night and day better. My anxiety is maybe a 3/10 compared to how it was. My vision isn’t bugging me as much. Caffeine still feels like a giga stimulant sometimes, but I can now drink coffee if I’m careful. No cravings, just missing the fun times I had. Things have gotten a lot better.

There is a calm in my life that I don’t think I’ve ever experienced before which is cool. 

HOWEVER

I still sometimes experience Panic Attacks occasionally, as well as Anhedonia / Depression. The panic attacks aren’t as bad as they used to be, but they are disheartening because I feel like they should have stopped by now. 

The Anhedonia / Depersonalization / Depression I’m feeling is the most disheartening for me currently. Pre-Nicotine I used to be very passionate about what I enjoy. I was motivated to stay in shape. I took pride in myself. All of that hasn’t returned. I still have existential thoughts / feelings. Perhaps my neurotransmitters haven’t 100% healed yet. Who knows? 

Is what I’m currently battling related to nicotine? Honestly I don’t know. I find myself thinking and dreaming about the feelings I had pre-nicotine. The fact that I’m not at that point yet has admittedly been demoralizing. 

To anyone who is at 4+ months and still recovering, I am there with you. The long hauler quit is not fun. But one thing for sure is that now I know I have all the confidence in the world that I will never go back to nicotine. ",1,1763403220.0,QuittingZyn,0,1.0,False

The problem i am having is shot volume inconsistency. I dail in my grind so i get 36g out in 25/30 seconds then when i pull a shot afterwards i get 50/60 grams out in the same 25/30 seconds. That's using the same beans on the same grind setting and prepping the puck exactly the same as the shot before. I use a WDT tool , distribution tool and a self levelling tamper. I make sure the machine is up to temp and the portafilter is hot for both shots.


Really don't know what to do. Ive tried numerous shots with and without preinfusion. I weigh the coffee into a dosing cup so its exactly 18g so retention isn't a factor. Am assuming there must be a fault with the machine. For reference I've had a Rocket Appartmento for a while before going for the Move and had consistent shot volumes everytime once the beans were dialed in. 

Any ideas? 

Really am at a loss what to do now as i have a machine that is virtually unusable as the shots are so inconsistent.

1oznmqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concussion/comments/1oznmqm/seeking_advice_and_perspective/,Seeking advice and perspective,"My last mild concussion was three months ago, and I healed within 3 weeks.

Now, just three weeks ago, I hit my head again very hard on the corner of a metal kitchen cabinet while getting up after bending down. It made me scream, and I was immediately dizzy afterwards.

I've gotten concussions before (3-4) so I know what it feels like. I knew I got one again.

However, I'm solo traveling currently. It was my last day permitted for my visa in the EU and I had to catch a plane just 5 hours later. I pushed through and made it to another country (Turkey) that day, felt relatively okay after two lattes.

I spent the following week drinking two coffees a day and pounding ibuprofen. I felt like I was steadily getting better.

I did not see a doctor.

After multiple ""mild"" concussions, my experience with doctors has been them telling me to take ibuprofen and rest. I think I got an MRI once or twice. I wish I got an MRI but I do not have travel health insurance currently, and I truly thought I was improving

By day 7, I felt good. A group of hostel-mates were going to a Turkish bath, and it sounded relaxing. We got a ride with an almost golf-cart-esque trolley through the streets of Istanbul. Between the ride there and back, there were so many unexpected bumps, twists, and turns that my head was left aching once again. I'm not sure if this was dangerous on day 7. I really was feeling okay. To my understanding, this wouldn't be re-concussing myself but just aggravating symptoms.

Now this part - please don't judge or scold me. The next day, I felt achey but okay. My friends were going out at night. I wanted to join, but obviously not drink. I decided to take a microdose of mushrooms. I thought it would be safe and perhaps even help me because I've read online they are very effective at treating post concussion syndrome. It did make me feel fine, in fact, and I had a fun night. However, once again, the bumpy road on the car ride back left my head aching even worse. Loud music might have also contributed to that; whatever the case, I felt shitty the next few days.

With coffee, I could mostly do my regular tasks and such, but I had moments of nausea begin to return the next 3 days, along with increased sensitivity.

Then, once a few more days passed, I felt fine.

My first day of feeling fine, I accidentally poked myself in the eye \*really hard\* (don't ask how, I have poor proprioception generally, hence the repeated concussions). It was a shock to my head I'm sure, but nowhere near the spot I originally injured it 2 weeks prior. Yet immediately, my headache returned, my eye hurt, and now my headaches have been bad daily ever since. That was one week ago.

Now I'm 3 weeks out from the original injury and I feel this pressure in my head, still a lot of pain/almost burry vision from poking my eye (unrelate to original injury), and a lot of sensitivity to sound. My brain feels slower in general. I guess it doesn't help that I've run out of ibuprofen the last 2 days, which could also add to my symptoms feeling worse. But I'm getting really worried. I want to heal.

I'm considering getting travel insurance so I can see a doctor, and perhaps get an MRI if somehow the insurance covers it. I wouldn't afford it otherwise.

But I'm hoping someone with more knowledge might ground me in reality. If it's 3 weeks out, is it worth it to get an MRI? Could I have some kind of brain bleed, or something else serious, that I might be neglecting and risking my health? Should I bother seeing a doctor at this point? Or do I just need to give it time?

1oznlhs,https://i.redd.it/uxg0mmbcyu1g1.png,Hangout Review: Meisho Doto,"Domo, Average Desu! It's been 2 days since my last review (I still love shuttle btw) and that isn't really sitting right with me. But, now that i've been a bit less occupied with my trainer duties, I figured that it's be a good time to document another lovely hangout with my beloved Umas! I've been thinking of this one for a while, and i'm so glad to finally get this down on paper! Or on Umaddit, I guess. So get your casts, cats and Omamori ready because today we're taking a day off with the one and only Doto-chan!

**INTERESTS:** Cats, Shonen Manga, Petting Zoos

Doto took a bit longer than some of the other Umas to walk out of Tracen at the end of the day, something I'd owe to her chronic bad luck. It was probably sunset by the time she came out, running towards me with about as much elegance as a duck. Beside her strode T.M Oprea O, who wore a confident and cool expression as she paralleled Doto's path - ready to catch the clumsy goofball if she fell.

Surprisingly enough, she was able to keep her balance as she stopped to greet me, bowing and apologizing profusely. It turns out that she'd completely forgotten about our hangout and had instead spent most of the day racing Opera O before the memory suddenly sparked. I looked into Doto's swirling eyes, which shone and sparkled like a purple lake. Through Opera O's larger-than-life monologue and Doto's whimpers, I felt some kind of maternal instinct spark inside me. I lent a hand to Doto's head, gently patting her head and stroking her hair with gentle and loving dexterity. The teary Uma's ragged breathing began to still, and slowly, she began to open her eyes to look at the beautiful world ahead of her.

T.M Opera O suggested that, considering it was very late and most of the petting zoos were closed by now, we'd head to her place and watch a movie. She even had a good handful of Manga volumes that filled Doto's niche. Doto straightened herself up and happily agreed, fists clenched with optimistic energy. I also decided to order 2 Lattes for takeout, which I informed Doto of as we headed off with T.M Opera O, bound to her dorm room.

On the brief walk, I decided i'd try to get Doto to talk about the things she liked. This was, of course, a Herculean task considering she thought so lowly of herself that it was ingrained in her mind that things like dreams or loves couldn't be shared. With some gentle coercion and grandiose remarks by T.M Opera O so corny they left Doto and I shuddering, the timid girl began to discuss her fascination with cats and other fuzzy little creatures she found cute.

""D-Did you know that b-bees like to play with toys? S-So do squirrels..""

Adorable fact after fact came out of Doto's mouth, to mine and T.M Opera O's amazement. She even asked Doto where she got such ""perspicacious"" knowledge from, to which Doto simply replied that she liked to read nature encyclopedias from time to time. Soon after, as we settled into Opera O's dorm - Lattes steaming with sugary smoke on her kitchen counter, we decided on movies to watch.

""W-Well, maybe o-one of the Dr. Stone chapters...""

""Well, why not a grandeur presentation of valor! I, the omnipotent being of worlds beyond, suggest the grand theatrical performance that is....""

Doto swiftly conceded, agreeing with Opera O on a whim. I noticed this, and asked Opera O if she was fine with watching Doto's choice of film. The kingly Uma pondered for a moment, before returning a look of approval. I turned over to Doto, whose eyes sparkled with delight. She smiled and held my arm, repeating tokens of gratitude that I knew came from deep in her soul. That's when it hit me.

Doto has been through a lot, that much is certain. Her limitless bad luck and disposition to holding herself with low regard led to a quiet, submissive personality that she found no joy in. But tenacity and a drive to live up to the expectations of others were what kept her moving, and approval was one of the only things she yearned for.

I told Opera O that Doto and I would get the Lattes from the kitchen and come back to her bedroom to get a movie settled for the night. Opera O gave a hearty laugh and held her remote to the sky, uttering more quotes that felt like they were ripped from a bombastic manga. As Doto and I made for the kitchen, I noticed that she was standing straighter than usual. It was no sooner than that moment of notice that I saw Doto trip..

I held her steady with my free arm, saving her from the fall...that is, if she was a normal high school girl and not an Umamusume. The two of us stumbled as I was swept along with Doto's incredible weight, but thankfully the scarlet carpets that Opera O had were enough to cushion the fall. How she managed to keep them clean all this time? Beats me.

As the two of us slowly got up, Doto checking her legs and arms for bruises, I asked her if she was okay. She gave me a dejected look and nodded silently, asking me the same. Surprisingly, falling at the same velocity as a living tank didn't hurt all that much, once again thanks to the clean carpets we were on. I pulled Doto in for a hug, before she could even get a chance to whimper and apologize for the events that had transpired.

Doto began tearing up, her silent cries muffled by the fabric of my sweater. I felt her trembling ever so slightly, and a slight compression as she wrapped her arms around my body. I started to pat her head again, and all manner of fluffy reassurances ensued as I tried to comfort her. However, just like what had happened in front of Tracen, the spark of guardianship fluttered inside me once more - this time brighter and more fierce. I could swear in the moment that I was like a father comforting his distraught daughter.

The words from my mouth came out more gently now, soft and sweet like a tender marshmallow. I slowly trudged to the kitchen, Doto still clutching me as she waddled at my side. As I stopped to pick up her Latte, I noticed a gentle feeling on my shoulder. I looked around, coffee in hand, to see Doto smiling at me and caressing my arm with tender gratitude. 

The fluorescent lights of T.M Opera O's home shone a yellow pumpkin orange, and I was awestruck by how good the colours looked as they sparkled in her eyes. It was like I was drawn into Doto's gaze, and the two of us locked eyes and gently smiled at eachother for what felt like forever before I snapped back to my senses and offered Doto the cup.

We made our way back to Opera O's bedroom, and settled ourselves on her brilliant violet couch. Before long, we were drawn into the elaborate story of the animated movie, Dr. Stone: Ryusui - one of Doto's favorites. We were mesmerized by the brilliant visuals and warm embrace of the coffee we had ordered. Opera O lounged on the left side, posing luxuriously on its pillowy frame. Doto and I took the middle and right, watching attentively like moths drawn to a lamp. 

As the hours stacked, I felt Doto's head weakly pressing on my shoulder and her quiet breathing as she dozed off to sleep. Even T.M Opera O, a normally energetic and eccentric empress, looked exhausted as she tried to keep her eyes open to watch what was left. I slowly began to fall asleep as well, my head resting on Doto's - and slowly but surely, the three of us found ourselves in the gentle embrace of a good night's sleep.

**VERDICT**: Dude, 10/10. Need I explain more?

But genuinely, I'm so so SOOO pumped to finally get this story done! As a matter of fact I was kinda hoping to make this about Golshi, but decided that Doto deserved a little bit of pampering instead. I say this as genuinely as I can, I love Meisho Doto and I want her to feel loved, and I hope I did her that justice in this review.

I have always been a bit of an introverted loner, but these last few months have made me realise that I am no longer just mostly alone, but that I’m actually lonely. I’m hoping this post here can be a bit of a kick-start to my social life. I’m not picky about how, whether it be real-life friends, virtual friends, texting buddies; I’m open for pretty much anything! I want to get off that autopilot life, so I’m looking for someone to share my thoughts and experiences with, and who wants to share their thoughts and experiences with me. Let’s ask each other meaningful or meaningless questions. Let’s talk about random crap, or about important things. Let’s share our life experiences, our passions, or what we’re having for dinner. Let’s share photo’s of the world around us, and about our place in that world. I like to think of myself as curious, open-minded and inclusive, so please, broaden my horizons!

You don’t have to be into the same stuff as me, but I’ll share a bit about myself just so that you know who you’d be talking to. I used to prefer coffee over tea, but am slowly starting to prefer tea. I thoroughly enjoy living in a city, but my ideal vacation is travelling to remote places and spending my days hiking or biking. I prefer paperbacks over hardcover books. I love muddling around in the kitchen. I own more watches than any sane person should. I’m a former fit person who got fat, and is trying (but so far failing) to get fit again. Having said all that, I've just started a postgraduate course through work, so most of my evenings for the foreseeable future will probably be spent studying😅

I have struggled massively with my mental health, and even though things are much better now, I continue to be in therapy. I’m just sharing this because I think it’s good to acknowledge the things I struggle with, and to show that I’m open-minded concerning personal battles.

You know what, I used to sweat when some girl in the bus was looking at me, I was so stressed I couldn't talk to them. I wasn't happy with myself and I was arguing with EVERYONE (more on that later). I was angry at everything around me, school, money, parents. Or when I wasn't angry I was sad and I used to be in that vegetative stage where I can't do anything because I'm stressed. 

I used to spent tens of hours on counter strike having over 2000 hours of ADDICTIVELY playing the game I didn't enjoy. 

I tried speaking to my friends around me about it but it's same as talking to alcoholic that doesn't know he's an alcoholic and convince him without it he might be happier. ""Ehhh can't do this can't do that, soon you will say to me I can't even eat chips!"" And they got always so FRUSTRATED about it. 

I think the worst part in caffeine is CORTISOL LEVELS. Man hear me out here. I could easily spot a difference between someone drinking caffeine and not drinking caffeine. Everyone that does drink seems to be overly sensitive about any opposing view, additionally they get angry because anyone else thinks a bit *differently*. 

I used to be that guy too, I used to get angry over anything. Argue with all the teachers, argue with all of my friends, argue with my classmates and I soon got a flare of a guy no one liked. I took things personally and sometimes couldn't even take a joke. 

Over these 2 years there used to be situations where I drank coffee. First moments were pretty chill, you know? Just like with any drug. But my man ohh my man how ANGRY 3-4 hours later! Furious with rage to the moment where I started shouting in my home, being like a ducking terrorists in the house, not any physical abuse of course. I was provoking my family members. Soon my anxiety and stress's levels were so high I just couldn't take it anymore and started crying. Crying releases cortisol that's why I used to cry when I had ""stressfull day"". 

And you know that's the part people miss out on. The amount of stress. People won't take any different opinion that yours, will freaking get mad at the whole world, that life is hard without often seeing beauty in any of it. 

Other things important to notice that changed my life are:
- not doing any alcohol or any nicotine (never did) 
- reading books, not any specific schedule, just to read books they massively changed my life, scientific books mostly
- Jim rohn 2 hour seminar that I used to listen to daily in bus. 

Yeah and I think that's it :-). This whole thing might've a bit chaotic, forgive me for that. Ask me any questions even the ones you think might be dumb or irrelevant like about my relationships, how did I talk to people addicted to caffeine, etc. ",3,1763402855.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

Hi there internet stranger!

I’m hoping to meet a fellow dumbass who’s into dumbassery just as much as I am .ideally someone who enjoys texting about everything, nothing and the chaotic nonsense in between. If that sounds like you then keep reading :)

Here are some random things about me to see if we’d click :
I’m 21 years old I have ADHD. I enjoy reading (currently on Zomerhuis met zwembad), journaling, baking, and crafting. I make a million playlists for every mood and then proceed to listen to none of them and save them on my iPod because apparently I’m a digital hoarder.

Not a movie girlie but I do love watching series now and then (currently binging Lang Leve de Liefde and KOTH). I like cafés, drinking too much coffee or tea, doing online crosswords, falling into YouTube rabbit holes, and reading random Wikipedia pages .I speak three languages and I’m slowly learning a fourth. I’m open to talking to pretty much anyone to see if we have a click .

Some things to expect if we become friends 
• Good morning messages (might not be sent in the morning)
• Random song recommendations 
• Someone you can annoy at any hour
• Virtual coffee dates (or whatever drink floats your boat)

“Being bipolar SUCKS
It essentially makes me into my own worst warden of the prison cell of my mind. Any routine I break is a warning sign, the result being that I lock myself into a mental prison which is almost OCD like. If I do anything differently than I usually do. It’s a sign of something bigger, that should be investigated. It’s a warning from my mind that something is off. So I essentially give myself this list of things, in my routine, that should never be changed. they act as marks, “if I do this the same I’m probably okay.”. Things like eating well, sleeping well, shitting well… to things so small and dumb and OCD-like, putting the drain plugs in the right order, drinking my coffee. And it fucking sucks. People without this problem don’t know how lucky they are. It’s a common problem, people get stuck in routines. But most people don’t have the stakes of manic psychosis lingering over them if they push their routine too far. I want to be able to treat everyday like it’s my first, go a night sleepless, fast for a day, make new decisions in new ways, try out new routines. But if I go too far off the path i’ve beaten, I end up in crazy town. And it’s so hard to explain to people who have never had psychosis. Because when thoughts that don’t belong in my head and aren’t based in reality creep in, I’m fully aware of it. But to quote Jason Louv, “the mind thinks like the tongue salivates.” And there’s just no stopping them. It’s like I have a small unlethal amount of poison dripping into my bloodstream via I.V. And it adds up over time. To continue the poison analogy, if I don’t satiate the poison with water (sleep, comfort, routine) I end up going into a ‘psychotic’ coma. And it has momentum, like a ball of snow rolling down a hill, these little decisions lead to bigger decisions. I’ve never written about this and i don’t usually journal. Not regularly at least. But today I am, and for all I know, like i am right now, tonight i’ll have my head down looking at my phone.. writing. But i won’t be writing this I’ll be writing my suicide note or my plan to save the universe (exaggeration, but not much of one). I’m in a worrisome state right now, Im seeing signs from the universe, thinking too quickly, not eating… The usual warning signs. But i can explain all of these things. Seeing signs is just an umbrella term that I’ve used for a long time to explain a thought. A thought like something good happens, (someone spills my coffee which i’ve already had too much of) and that is a sign from the universe that it’s looking out for me. That’s not crazy that’s a coincidence that my pattern seeking brain has delusionally grandized. I’m thinking too fast because i drank too much coffee. I’m not eating because i want to lose weight. But the prison warden of my mental stability is threatening to send me to solitary, it’s time to eat.”",1,1763402593.0,Psychosis,0,1.0,False

After watching many of Dr. S Sim's videos, I realize I need to change my exercise schedule.

What I've been doing right- eating a mostly whole food plant based diet rich in beans/legumes/complex carbs, get regular (at least 8 hours) sleep, reduce work schedule, short daily meditation and push ups/planks.

I am starting daily creatine and plant based protein powder.  Tried hot profee (protein coffee)for the first time- not super tasty but palatable :)

Where I've been lacking is the form of physical exercise- For my mental health its been amazing b/c its focused on yoga, walk/hike but I realize its not good for maintaining/building muscle/bone density for longevity in post menopause.

My current exercises keep me in medium intensity/zone 2 (45 mins yoga/ 1 hour evening walk on treadmill/1-2 hours walk/hiking up to 3x week).  

I did not know there was a need for completely different exercises for longevity/muscle/bone density and assumed yoga/walk/hike/bike would be good for menopause too.

These are the things I want to incorporate but not sure how they are work together on a daily basis throughout the week while including rest breaks from lifting.

1. Jump training (10 mins) 3 x week.
2. Heavy resistance training 3 x week.  I purchased dumbbells (5-25lbs) and plan to follow Lift w/Cee and keep reps between 6-8 or 8-10.  I think Cee goes 10-12 but Dr Sim recommends 6-8
3. Sprint interval training- 30 seconds high intensity (9-10 exertion) then recover 2 x week (plan to do 5 burpees and recover per minute and repeat x5)
4. HIIT- 1-4 minutes high intensity (7-8 exertion) w/1-4 minutes recovery 2 x week (plan on squat jumps to get some bone impact too)

Am I supposed to include Jump training/HIIT/Sprint interval training ON the same lifting day either before/after lifting or on the rest days?

Right now I'm doing heel drops in the am (waiting for water to boil) and sprinkled throughout the day to get about 10 minutes.

Plan is a home gym in minimal space.  Right now dumbbells only.  May add kettleballs or ????

I thought this made me a 'dedicated' trader. It made me a stressed-out, reactive mess.

I was constantly micro-managing. I'd move stops up too early and get shaken out. I'd see a tiny bit of profit and close a winning trade before it hit my target, all out of fear.

Three months ago, I deleted the app.

I now do my analysis before the market opens and after it closes. I set my entries, my stops, and my targets. I write them down. And then... I walk away.

I might check at lunch. I'll definitely check at the close. But that's it.

The result? My trading is calmer, more disciplined, and more profitable. I'm letting my trades breathe. I'm letting my strategy play out without my emotions interfering.

The dmg boost after a charged att is really helpful for Goa using foreseer cards (or r0 Goa). Would also be helpful for LSG since using charged att after active skill during special mode is a staple of his rotation. Not so much the king or the dragon. Obviously, the claymore absolutely. 

I was surprised that these lower stats worked. During the off everything within the time limit level I couldn’t break shac.kles as quic.kly as usual, because I’d off them too fast for the stac.ks to build.

I am going to scout the area this week as I don't want to step on any toes that are established already.

here you can see my rather bold and colorful room. I know it’s too much for many people, but I feel very comfortable here. Still, I’m still in the process of furnishing it and many things are still open. So I have a few questions and hope you can give me some new ideas. Basically, the desk should stay where it is, and I also want to hang lots of hanging plants with macramé from the ceiling.

1. How would you arrange the seating furniture? I definitely want to keep the sofa and the chaise longue, and I also have a second Acapulco chair in green. I don’t plan on installing a TV, but I do want to add a coffee table in front of the couch. The couch should preferably stay on this wall, I just don’t know how to arrange the furniture around it. Do you have any ideas?
2. What type of ceiling lamp would you recommend? When I am in the room, 95% of the time I use mood lighting because I find bright ceiling lights unpleasant. The smoke from the (still-to-be-installed) cigarette-on-the-ceiling installation is illuminated, and there is also a small light next to the door. I will add more smaller light sources as well. Nevertheless, I would like a ceiling lamp instead of the bare cables. I just don’t know which shape or style would fit.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Utah Mammoth vs. Anaheim Ducks: A Goalie’s Worst Nightmare and a Sieve’s Best Friend**

The Utah Mammoth and Anaheim Ducks collide on Monday, November 17, 2025, in a game that’s as statistically tangled as a pair of Christmas lights. Let’s untangle this mess with math, mockery, and a dash of madness.

**Odds & Implied Probabilities: A Tale of Two Teams**  
The moneyline odds are eerily balanced: Ducks at **-110** and Mammoth at **-110**, implying a 52.4% chance for each to win (via decimal conversions). But the spread tells a subtler story. Anaheim is laying **1.5 goals** at odds of \~-140, while Utah’s +1.5 line sits at +290. That suggests bookmakers see Anaheim as a slight favorite, but not a runaway. The total is **6.5 goals**, with the over/under priced evenly (1.91 for both). Given that these teams average **6.9 goals per game** combined—0.4 *above* the total—the over is a statistical no-brainer. Bet on the over unless you’re a masochist with a savings account to burn.

**Injury Report: The Ducks Waddle, the Mammoth Limp**  
Utah’s injuries are a two-punch combo: Alexander Kerfoot (lower body, out) and Sean Durzi (shoulder, out). Kerfoot’s absence is like losing your favorite coffee—suddenly, the offense is less smooth. Durzi’s injury? Imagine a sieve getting a crack. It’s worse. The Ducks, meanwhile, have Ryan Poehling (upper body, day-to-day) and Mikael Granlund (lower body, day-to-day) listed as “day-to-day.” Translation: They’ll probably play, but they’ll move like they’re wading through molasses after a 12-hour Netflix binge.

**Analytics: Process vs. Results**  
Utah’s \*\*56.

Being an abolitionist hurts sometimes. (Just needed to vent!!!!)

ETA explanation because I now realize this is vague:

\-- I am a social worker providing informal emotional support/morning coffee to a 17-yo neighbor who is being scapegoated by family  
\-- Family has now identified me and has shown up to my house, verbally harassed me, mostly in a religiously discriminatory way (I have open pagan symbols on my home)  
\-- There are LOTS AND LOTS OF REASONS I am not calling CPS right now  
\-- I sought emotional support for this situation in a subreddit for adult kids estranged from their parents, as this interaction was INCREDIBLY triggering (teenager's family is quite reminiscent of mine)  
\-- I got told I was ""deluding myself out of responsibility"" by not calling CPS, despite the fact that my responsibility in this situation is pretty much all I've been thinking about for the last 2 weeks

As far as I've understood it, we don't yet know the genes that code for the several different types of collagen issues in hEDS patients. Moreover, oral collagen is not bioavailable, so even if my body knew what to do with it, it wouldn't be able to utilize it anyway. I've heard talk of hydrolyzed collagen, but I feel that would fall into the same line of thinking, where my body is unable to create collagen effectively even with the right tools. If there are any updated studies on this, please let me know!

I've been vegan for over a decade, and it has greatly improved the GI issues and MCAS flares that I used to get. This particular doctor has suggested numerous times that I should become omnivorous again, but when I ask about studies, I get told that there is 'anecdotal evidence,' which to me is not sufficient to compromise my morals and comorbidities. Most recently, he's suggested that I at minimum try collagen supplementation, but without the studies, I again run into the same conundrum.

Is there more recent published information regarding diet changes and/or collagen processing out there, and he's just unable to recall it in the moment? Or is this really just him drawing on his (admittedly ample) personal experience with his clients? I would seriously consider trying collagen supplementation if there was sufficient evidence that it would help due to the degree of my disease, but I sincerely doubt my body will be able to process animal products again (source: the three times my local coffee shop fucked up my order).

Chief Simmons shuffled through the papers on his desk, it was quite messy despite his efforts to run a clean precinct. Or maybe because of his efforts.

He was part way through a seven page report around a problematic disappearance when Lt Holley burst into his office, scattering some papers sitting by the door.

""Sorry, Chief, I woulda been here sooner if a P.o.I. wasn't in the crowd from last night's corral."" The lighter built, probably over caffeinated man said as he stepped in and sat down, ""We managed to pick up a few dozen cardinals at the unscheduled holiday celebration on 23rd, between Outer and Ramp.""

Chief Simmons chuffed and set aside his papers, ""Pick up any of the Republic or Church guys?""

""Sadly no, none of them had any regulated weapons they weren't allowed to have and all had enough threat to use self defense to get out of detainment. Them and the Canary guys did a good job of keeping civvies behind cover and calm while everything happened."" Lt Holley paused for a bit before adding, ""It actually looks like a PR win for us in the end.""

He took the papers from his lieutenant as he listened to the brief, thumbing through the pages for anything important. ""Sounds like we avoided a headache for once, do *all* the Cardinals have some outstanding warrant?""

""ho-oh yea,"" Holley blurted out with an emphatic nod, ""We've has cases building for most of them for awhile, a lot of corporations are willing to buy up punitive rights from their victim's families. Enough that the fees basically cover our whole shortfall this month.""

Chief looked up at him with a quirked eyebrow, ""That bad, huh?""

""The corporations are practically shoving eachother for first pick while we interrogate them."" The man looked very satisfied by the whole turn of events.

the Chief nodded ""Solves one problem, anything about the redhead we've been looking for?""

""The one two companies are after on the whims of the noble houses leading them? Yes, actually."" Holley reported.

Simmons waited, and Holley sat stock still.

""Well?"" the Chief asked

""We let her go.""

The smack of Chief's palm impacting his own face shook the office as he ground his forehead into it.

""You realize she could clear up an incredible amount of pain and suffering for us? You *know* VidaCumbre is looking for her for,"" Chief Simmons checked his pile, ""seventeen different reasons? And Zephyr Aerospace is about to break into the market for mechs specifically *to* get at Vida to find out what happened to the daughter of their design head.""

Lt Holley just held up his hands, ""Our guys were there to bust a street brawl, she didn't look involved and was almost a block away from the whole mess! They barely had a reason to stop her, let alone detain her.""

Simmons groaned as he leaned back into his chair.

""We can't update her description, because both companies would go looking and interfering. We can't put out any more public notice than for any other missing person's request, we even have to contain the companies that are trying."" He slid over a file and opened it, passing the packet to Holley as he went on

""By all accounts she should be heading back to her family, but hasn't. By all accounts she either stole a bunch of confidential samples from a pharma corp or was forcibly injected with them, to unknown effect. And ontop of all that, Fleet command is now interested.""

Holley paused and looked up at him, ""Fleet command, sir?""

He nodded and leaned back in his seat, ""It's all just preliminary right now, but first contact was a month ago. An intervention now is far too much coincidence for them.""

Suddenly Lt Holley was taking things much more serious now.

\---

The shot from my revolver took the form of a stream of fire and punched a hole through the mugger, wrapping around his body from that hole. He drifted upward as he evaporated into embers and ash in the wind.

Me and Fiadh both stood there for a second or two before Fiadh looked at me in shock, ""What The BALLS was That!?""

""A revolver, I Found it!"" I turned it over to show to her as she fumbles away a bit before pushing my hand back against my chest.

""You cannot go flashing around mana heavy attacks like that without bodyguards to back you up, and *I* don't count."" I work on putting the revolver back in its strap while she frets and pokes around on me, eventually grabbing my face and pulling me to look her square in the eyes. ""Did you ever pay attention in Mana and magic management? Like at all?""

""I'm fine,"" I might feel a little drunk but I don't know if it's just her or not.

""You could have overdrawn your reserves, do you know what happens when you do that?"" She asks me, 100% serious.

I giggle a bit at her concern, playfully offering an ""I explode"" that may have come out slurred.

She sighs and shakes her head, ""Right, you're sitting your ass down until you talk good and then I'm taking you to a gun shop so you can trade that Thing off for something WAY more tame.""

""I talk good!"" I argue with only a slight slur as she pulls me into a headlock and drags me along the sidewalk more.

Turns out I was right, the bakery is right down the street, in the middle of a T intersection that we're walking across. She pulls me from one side of the road to the other and into the storefront, plopping me in a chair by the window before going back behind the counter and trading insults with her mother.

I admit, I do feel a bit of a mix between drunk and wrung out but a few deep breaths and thoughts of putting mechs together has that feeling Gone before anyone can poke me about it.

The bakery starts buzzing with activity from three girls I don't know, Fiadh's mother (i think) and a guy that works in the back hefting things around. Customers arrive one by one, exchanging gossip about the town as they wait to place their order or wait for it to be filled.

A lot of the talk is about the brawl I escaped from, or some poor homeless chick wandering around after getting smacked by a car.

Refraining from speaking up about anything I just listen and vibe. Eventually smells like coffee start to waft out as the ladies move to the side and leave a second section of counter open for another line. Which is when men start showing up.

The guy from the back comes out and starts confirming 'the usual' with everyone except a rare few. The men order egg, cheese and ham sandwiches, variations on black coffee, and the odd spiced cider, consistently cycling through without lingering.

Some will point to some donuts or pastries, at least one asked for a loaf of bread stuffed with ""whatever meat scraps and cheese trimmings"" which looked very tasty. I poked someone to order one of those on my behalf and paid them the next bill up from the price when they brought it back to me.

The interior of the bread was torn up and packed in with chunks of melting or crumbled cheese with rough chunks of honey baked ham mostly evenly distributed. The crust was firm enough to act like a pouch containing all that goodness and I held back just enough to get a good breath of the fresh bread and its packing before chomping down on the leathery crust and filling.

I curled up and lost myself in the bread for long enough that the crowd had mostly drained back out the door, leaving a tired staff and some impatient looking corporate types lingering.

Dusting off my hands and giving myself a twist back and forth that cracked my spine with a glorious crunch, I pushed myself off the chair and stepped into line. At least one giving me a startled look, I had an idea for some donuts and I had inside knowledge for how to get a lot of them.

Making sure to wave everyone else in front of me as I concocted my order. The counter worked fast though and I was up before I was ready, getting caught off guard by the woman there to meet me.

""You're the stray my daughter keeps getting caught up with?"" She asked rather accusingly.

An eyebrow went up at that, ""You responsible for giving her those arms?""

She let out a barking laugh before fixing me with a look.

""I do have an order, but I don't know if you'd be amenable to it."" When she didn't say anything but raised an eyebrow in turn I gave my order, ""I'd ask for a charitable donation of any nearly expired food to feed the less fortunate or financially challenged, for only 50% of the standard price""

""Packaging agnostic?"" She asks,

""Packaging agnostic."" I confirm with a nod.

""80% of original price."" She counters.

I hum and rub my chin, ""Seems like the normal catering or bulk discount, wouldn't this stuff get thrown out and be a total loss?""

""End of day perhaps, but it's still valid stock as long as the ovens are still hot."" I nod back, what she's saying makes sense but

""Anything already being replaced or taken out of sale stock that isn't packed into a garbage bag?"" I ask again.

She leans back with her arms crossed ""Sure, but not for sale to customers.""

Thus the trap.

""Ma'am I assure you, this is a charity effort. I will be delivering any donated food items to those in need. Anything bad, expired or otherwise tainted will be sorted from deliverable stock and properly disposed of."" I say with my best sales voice.

She hums, ""Don't look too official for a charity representative. 75% original price""

""Ma'am, in our organization, form follows function. While we are still getting our start and don't have any official suppliers, we will still work with any donated equipment."" I spread my arms and show my tool cloak with a little half spin, avoiding showing the side with my revolver, ""60% original price.""

""You'll be back, right? This isn't a one time thing, is it?"" She asks.

I smile, ""We will absolutely be back, you already come highly reviewed from our clients, we just need a more official way of delivering it to them to avoid littering, sanitation and vagrancy laws.""

She grumbles and peeks behind me at the line, ""65% original price, bring paperwork for anything lower.""

""Thank you ma'am, we're already working on that."" Running a charity team on selling scrap parts could work, what's a good name for that?

""I'll let you take any other orders you need while all that gets packed up."" I say as I step aside and find a nice seat next to the counter.

The three or four other people in line get things from one of the usual cashiers as I get the stink eye from everyone but Fiadh's mom, who is busy packing boxes with reckless amount of force and a grin.

Fiadh eventually comes around the side of the counter to check in on me, ""You ordered something?""

I chuckled, ""Yea, your ma seems very happy with packing it.""

She cringes a bit as a low cackle echos across the room to us.

""We've got to get you over to the shop before my lunch break is over, I won't argue with the strap, no sane belter would."" Fiadh watches her mother as another box gets stacked, sounding very dense, ""But she's gonna be mad if my break gets stretched by the commute.""

Other customers start giving looks as donut boxes get taped up after stacking 4 high, each getting their cargo compressed into them to fit more. With one stack on the counter and another forming in back I shrug and smile up at Fiadh.

""She looks like she's having fun though."" I say.

She sighs, ""Certainly sounds like it.""

Then her mother comes around the corner and drops the stack of boxes onto the counter with a thud. She doesn't have to say anything for me to get up and return to the counter, where the register is making some angry beeps as she types in things.

The beeps seem to make her chuckle, while I pull out a roll of cash and start counting through while the total jumps up by leaps and bounds.

""870 and change credits, If You have them."" She tells me, almost looking smug.

""4 hundos, 23 twenties, 2 fives and how many more ones?"" I reply

She harrumphs and checks through the bills before checking the total again, ""Seven ones, do you care about change?""

""Nope, I got enough jangly metal for one person already."" I say as I pass the last bit over and start contemplating how I'm going to wrangle those boxes.

""You just going to carry those?"" Fiadh asks and I grin,

""The people need their food, Fiadh. I'll find a way."" Then me and her mother share an evil laugh.",3,1763401860.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

*“I live in two worlds… one is a world of books.” — Rory Gilmore*

Hi everyone! I’m so excited you’re here and officially joining our little Stars Hollow–inspired reading community. Whether you’re a lifelong Gilmore Girls fan, a new reader, or someone who just wants an excuse to buy more books (no judgment — truly), you’re in the right place.

# 🌟 What This Community Is About

This subreddit is dedicated to reading and discussing every book mentioned, referenced, or lovingly quoted throughout *Gilmore Girls*. We’re here to:

* Explore Rory’s reading lists
* Host group reads and discussions
* Share book recommendations
* Chat about how each book ties into the show
* Celebrate our mutual love of coffee, pop culture, and all things Stars Hollow

# 📅 How It Works

We’ll be posting:

* **Monthly or biweekly group reads** (depending on community preference)
* **Discussion threads** for each book
* **Fun prompts**, polls, and Gilmore-inspired chats
* **Reading list progress check-ins**

Everyone is welcome to read at their own pace — we’re more “read with joy” than “read like Rory cramming for AP English.”

# 💬 Get Involved

Jump in with:

* An intro post (tell us your favorite character or your coffee order!)
* A book you’re excited to read
* A question about the reading list
* A meme, quote, or bookish moment

This community is meant to feel like grabbing a table at Luke’s: warm, inviting, and just a tiny bit chaotic in the best way.

# ☕ A Few Simple Rules

* Be kind — we’re here to celebrate books and the show, not debate anyone’s literary worthiness
* No spoilers without tags
* Keep things Gilmore-, book-, or reading-related
* Respect different interpretations and reading speeds

# 🎉 We're So Glad You're Here

Thank you for helping make this book club a reality. Let’s grab a cup of coffee, crack open some pages, and start reading our way through Stars Hollow together.

1ozmsxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ozmsxd/asked_out_an_old_school_acquaintance_25f_after_10/,Asked out an old school acquaintance (25F) after 10+ years – had an amazing 3-hour coffee catch-up but turns out she has a boyfriend. My (26M) story + lessons for overthinkers,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons—want to keep this anonymous. I'm a guy in my mid-20s, and this is my recent experience with shooting my shot. Figured sharing it might help someone else who's in their head about asking someone out. TL;DR at the bottom.

**Backstory:**  
I knew this girl from school—we were in the same class until about 8th grade, like 10-11 years ago. We weren't close back then, just acquaintances. Fast forward to last year: We're connected on social media, I see her posts, and damn, she's gorgeous. I start developing a crush just from her pics and stories. Nothing crazy, but she's confident, fit, and seems like a great person.

A couple months ago, I spot her at my local gym. We recognize each other, say hi a few times, but it's loud and crowded, so no real chat. I build up the nerve (after overthinking for weeks) and message her last week: ""Hey, how've you been? Haven't seen you at the gym lately—are you still going?"" She replies her schedule got busy, so she's skipping. I suggest catching up over coffee since the gym noise makes talking impossible. She says yes pretty easily.

**The Meet-Up:**  
We plan for Sunday. I get there early, she shows up a bit late (no big deal). We grab coffee and start talking—school memories, college life, hostel stories, drinking habits, even light stuff about relationships and dating apps like Bumble. The vibe is amazing: back-and-forth, laughs, no awkward silences. Neither of us checks the time much. It lasts almost 3 hours! The cafe staff keeps hinting for the bill, that's the only reason we wrap up. Felt like we both didn't want it to end.

After, I text her to confirm she got home safe. She says yes, and we banter: I say I enjoyed it and don't make me wait long for the next one. She replies ""Likewise... haha noted."" I add that good company made me forget my whole list of topics. She says ""Glad to hear that."" Ends with some light jokes about her being a ""doc"" (inside thing) and goodnight.

**The Ask-Out:**  
I'm buzzing but overthinking—is this just nostalgia for her, or real interest? I share a relatable reel with her (from our convo) a couple days later; she reacts positively. That gives me the push. I send: ""Heyy, I was thinking about our meet last Sunday — can’t believe we talked for almost 3 hours 😅. I don’t usually open up that easily, but that conversation really felt one of a kind to me. I’d like to ask you out on a date if you’re okay with it.""

**Her Reply:**  
""Hey that’s really thoughtful of you to say…I had a good time catching up too. I’m in a relationship, though, so I’d like to keep things friendly. Still..it was great reconnecting after so long!""

Gut punch, but honest. I reply: ""Got it—no worries at all. Was great reconnecting too. Take care 😊"" And that's it. No more texts.

**What I Learned (and Why I'm Posting):**

* **Ask sooner:** I waited too long to make my intentions clear. That 3-hour chat felt like a date to me, but to her, it was probably just friendly catch-up with an old acquaintance. If I'd escalated earlier, I'd have known about the BF without the buildup.
* **Overthinking kills:** I agonized over the ""perfect"" message and timing for days. In the end, her answer was set—timing didn't change it. Just shoot your shot clean and confident.
* **Rejection isn't failure:** It stings (she's beautiful, sweet, and we clicked), but clarity > limbo. Worst case? You walk away with dignity. No bridges burned, especially since we have mutual friends from school.
* **Signs aren't always signals:** Staying 3 hours, laughing, replying flirty-ish? Felt mutual, but she was just being nice/loyal. Don't read too much into vibes without action.
* **Move on quick:** Deleted the chat, muted her stories, uninstalled the app for a bit. Hit the gym harder, started Bumble. Life goes on—better to know than wonder.

If you're crushing on someone from your past, go for it, but keep expectations low and ask direct. Anyone been in a similar spot? How'd you handle the ""friendly"" pivot?

TL;DR: Reconnected with old school acquaintance via gym/social media, crushed hard, had epic 3-hour coffee meet, asked her out—turns out she's taken. Handled it gracefully, learned to ask faster and not overanalyze.",1,1763401324.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

convenience is one of my top priorities but by now I also don’t want to miss out on good coffee anymore — my current one just tastes too average.

So now there are two options. Option 1 is the Sage Oracle Jet. It only needs 2–3 minutes to heat up, has an integrated grinder, and offers semi-automatic preparation. The coffee quality would improve a lot and the convenience level would still stay relatively high.

For the same price, however, I could also get a portafilter machine and a separate grinder, which would push the quality even further. But the convenience factor would plummet. In that case, I’d currently favor the Bezzera BZ10 and the Eureka Specialita.

That’s where things stand right now. What do you think?

edit: so I guess my actual question is: Is there really a big difference in terms of convenience between these two options or did I miss something?",1,1763400969.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1ozmhov,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexOffenderSupport/comments/1ozmhov/in_limbo_scotland/,In Limbo (Scotland),"Well, as the title says, I well and truly feel like I am currently in limbo. In fact, it kid of feels like purgatory! 

Short recap for anyone unfamiliar, I had ""The Knock"" on August 25th and was arrested on September 21st for a small amount of Cat C IIOC found on my phone that had previously been seized.

Answered to my Undertaking on October 21st, and been on bail since. Appropriate documents sent to my Legal Aid Board via solicitors, but awaiting confirmation on that as I had to send an extra piece of evidence to proof a recently cashed cheque was a tax rebate. Believe once this situation is finalised, the solicitors will be putting in my guilty plea.

So far, there is definitely nothing to suggest any more has been found on my phone or any other devices, so hopefully once the plea is given, my sentencing wont be too far in the future so I can actually get an idea of what life is going to be like for the next few years or so. Then again, if I am being classed as a lower priority case, then I guess it could also go the other way!

Still haven't done anything getting a new phone or getting my actual number back. Simply been using a basic ""burner"" phone with a top up for last few months. 

I have talked with LFF/Stop It Now Scotland. It's been a couple of weeks now, however, so looks like I'm gonna need to chase that up. I know the guy suggested perhaps having me see their Forensic Psychologist to get a better idea of which of their courses/support service would suit me best giving my individual conditions (Personally being sexually assaulted at age 7, continuously corrupted by someone close to me throughout my early adolescence and teens, leading me into an early and long lasting interest in porn and sexual tv programming, sex lines and sexual chatting and sharing of intimate photos of myself with people of all ages and genders on chat sites/apps).

I'm still waiting to hear from a charity led counselling service focused on dealing with Childhood SA, and enquired via StopSo other day as well. Definitely need to start the process with Doctors in regards to my mental health, and more so neurodiversity, but overthinking about how long of a drag this might be just paralyses me, alongside general executive dysfunction, and phone anxiety.

I was diagnosed ADHD in childhood, but didn't continue my treatment and check ups in regards to this in my teens into adulthood, so likely need to start process all over again. I'm constantly putting myself off by reading about how long and how much of a fight it will likely be, especially in my area. Don't really think going private will be an option for me, especially if I don't turn out to be eligible for legal aid.

I've been off work (barista at a major chain coffee shop) since my arrest in September, but still neither officially quit or been let go. I've not been able to bring myself to telling them what has actually gone down, so initially went off based on the physical health issues. I figured I would just put my notice in based on this and mental health issues, giving that so far there is no real way they could know without me divulging from what I can tell. I am convinced I would lose the job anyway, because of it being person facing with chance of contact with children, not to mention company reputation concerns, so it seems six of one and half a dozen of an other really. In all fairness, I couldn't see myself returning to it now, and don't exactly miss the stress. Think it's safe to say that I wouldn't actually want to go back even if they would let me continue.

The dilemma right now with that situation, however, is that I did actually attempt to put in my notice the other week, but let my self be swayed by my manager offering to put me on long term sick and visit again at start of 2026. Giving that this would mean I still get SSP for a couple of months, I thought it might be better option due to uncertainty of getting any other employment or on going means of income any time soon, and universal credit possibly not actually being accessible to me due to the circumstances. Problem is, I was meant to confirm my choice with manager last week and I've have since totally frozen up and ghosted on the situation, which obviously isn't best way to handle it. 

Feels like all I keep doing is making things harder for myself, and prolonging the inevitable. While I know I should just get that stuff over and done with, I feel totally paralysed by just the thought of it all. 

On the flipside, I keep going between feeling like I am not doing enough and feeling like I can't really do much right now because nothing is really moving forward away. So, I've just fallen into a habit of playing video games, watching TV and doom scrolling Reddit and FB. 

So again, I guess I'm looking for a little advice on how to proceed on some of the above, and what else I can do to help myself/show I am making an effort while I wait. Can't help feel like if I was being judged on what I am doing right now, the relevent authorities would deem me as not taking things seriously enough or actually wanting to grow or better myself. I try to remind myself that it's a big shock, and that I should be kinder to myself about possibly needing some time (and that likely there isn't actually any rush in some cases), but paranoia and self doubt keeps creeping in.

On the plus side, I've actually decided to do No Nut November this year, as I was inadvertently taking part anyway! Generally doing my best to limit any kind of consumption of sexual media at the moment to be on safe side, and would say my drive for self relief etc. has diminished quite a bit since this all started as well as the health issue that I had. I don't have a partner or fwb or anything like that either, so there really isn't any temptation right now to break the streak lol.

Most importantly, I haven't reoffended, and haven't entered any sites that are likely to put me at risk of doing so or would raise concerns if my search history is analysed. 

Well, I'd assume so, anyway. I guess over all, that is down to the discretion of who ever is analysing it. I know at least I haven't explicitly done so.

Hello guys! Probably a stupid question, but last year I got my girlfriend a delonghi ecp 3420 and its done pretty well so far. I didnt want to go all in and buy a stupid expensive machine I wanted to get the feet wet and start slow. So far she loves it and she uses it every day, but lately I know she keeps getting bad coffees and shitty grinds from preground coffee.. 

Im thinking for christmas I wanna give her a good upgrade, decent hand grinder (was looking at the MHW-3BOMBER R3 as its a decent price around 150 in canada) or open to suggestions there? Currently still in the research phase for it... ANYWAYS im wondering about getting non-pressurized baskets for it? Is that something you can just do with this type of machine? Would a good grinder and a non pressurized basket be a good upgrade? ",1,1763400530.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1ozmdl9,https://v.redd.it/2v45a5w4qu1g1,Anyone else surprised how much AI can boost learning and fitness? Just came across something interesting.,"So I came across something today that honestly blew my mind a bit:

Studies show that people who track their learning goals with AI improve 3× faster, and those who follow AI-guided fitness routines stick to their **habits 4× longer**.  
I didn’t expect the numbers to be *that* dramatic.

And while going down this rabbit hole, I found an app called [**Looma AI**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/looma-ai-companion-and-coach/id6748575351)**,**  basically a bundle of 40+ AI “coaches” for learning, fitness, study help, habit-building, etc.  
You can ask it anything from:  
• “Make me a workout plan for the next 4 weeks”

1ozmdd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ozmdd1/my_wife_51f_and_i_46m_look_to_be_divorcing_after/,My wife (51F) and I (46M) look to be divorcing after 20 years... it's a saga.,"Changing names to protect privacy.  My wife (51F) will be listed as ‘Jane’ and I’ll (46M) be listed as ‘John.’

A year ago, we’re in our therapy (after a year of the focus being on me, and me doing a lot of work on myself) and the therapist said ‘seems like you guys are doing pretty well, haven’t heard of any issues for a while’ and Jane saying ‘John has made a lot of great changes, etc. etc.  And then the therapist was like ‘John, I know you’ve been patient… we’re going to start turning the focus the other way now, toward Jane.’  I made a request in that session saying ‘I’d like to stop looking at porn (not a ton, a few times a week if I took care of myself)… Jane, I’d like to get your support in that in the near term… maybe replace those activities with some more time to connect between us, even if it’s not sexual.’  Got no engagement in that, and when I asked about it in session a couple months later, she was mad, saying ‘it’s totally inappropriate to put that on me.  I’m not responsible for your healing.’  

Told her in January “I can feel that the anniversary of my mom’s death (in February) is going to hit me really hard.  I feel like I’ve kept it at bay for this last year, but I can feel more and more loss each day.”  Got some support, but ultimately told ‘I’m a little jealous of the relationship you had with your mom.  I don’t have that with mine, and I don’t really like her much anymore.’

Starting in January I noticed that sometimes I couldn’t see her on Find My Friends.  We’ve had that on for each other since it became a feature, in case of emergencies and such, although I’d use it once in a while to notify me that she’d be on her way home, so I could pickup the house or open a bottle of wine for her or just take care of something in the house to be thoughtful.  That stopped working all together and I asked about it in-session and she was like ‘yah, I turned that off.’  “Shouldn’t that be something we discuss?  We had it on in case there was an emergency and no cell service, fire or earthquake or such.”  “You turned it off too, I can’t see you.”  “No.  I don’t believe you know how that works.  If you removed me, it’s bi-directional.”  “Oh.”  She understood then that I didn’t change anything.  I went to her the next day and said ‘I understand that you didn’t know that removing me from Find My Friends did that for both of us.  I have no problem with you seeing where I am and I think it’s a good thing, especially if one of us has the kids.  I want you to know where I am in case of an emergency, so I’m re-sharing with you.’  She accepted me re-share, but never reciprocated the share herself.

We had an issue in March where my friend (she stayed with Jane and I for a couple different stints when she was trying to ‘make it’ in LA) was going to stay in a separate room at my AirBnb when I was in London.  Jane was fine with that.  I got to the AirBnb and realized it was smaller than expected.  I called Jane to tell her and ask if she’d be OK with me making a bed in the hallway and giving her the room and she was like ‘do whatever…’. I called her back in a few minutes and said ‘hey, I can see that upset you, and I’m really far away and you’ve got the kids and everything.  I’m having her just get her own place since this AirBnb isn’t as advertised…”. “Ok, thanks.”  The next day she bought a bunch of sex toys on Amazon, 2 of which were things she said ‘I’d never use that’. To me it felt like ‘mad-at-me-bought’ sex toys.  I didn’t know about these until they arrived in our foyer when I got back home to California.  She received them, and I never saw them again, outside of a like-for-like replacement for one we already enjoyed.

 

I  
lose my job the next week.  She starts changing her schedule a bit, and  
getting pretty dressed up to ‘run errands.’  Running errands goes from  
once a week (twice once in a while) to 3-4 times per week…Job market  
sucks and I’m not finding anything.  Get  
some interviews and down to final selection for two opportunities, but get  
passed over. 

Around April, she walks through our bedroom while I’m resting, stops, and says ‘you know, I like to have sex just as much as you…’ and just walks out. 

Around this same time she tells me ‘sometimes I’m just so depressed I can’t even get out of bed.’

I have to have surgery min-June, and I added having a vasectomy at the same time, since it was a related area.  I was laid up for 3 weeks and couldn’t ejaculate.  I noticed I stopped looking at at Instagram hot girls or any porn at all…. This has stuck with me, and I haven’t gone back to any of that.  It was actually pretty easy.  The recovery from surgery helped me stop looking at porn.  Great result.  So, in the past 18 months, I stopped drinking alcohol (went from 5-6 drinks per week), stopped using marijuana (was doing the once per day in the evening), and then adding in stopping looking at porn.

At this point, I’m not relying on finding a new job (as my severance is almost out).  I’m credentialed as complimentary medicine doctor and have been seeing patients part time.  My spouse also is equally credentialed.  I had gone back to my old career during Covid and got a good job and just ‘rolled with that’ for a bit. 

The ‘triggering moment’ was: it’s a few days before our 20th anniversary (she didn’t even mention we were having it, so I found a place and made a reservation), and she’s been ‘running errands’ more frequently (even though I don’t have steady work and we’re burning through savings.  She’s getting dressed up nice and I’m say to her ‘you like nice.’  “I need to run some errands.”  Cool, where to?  Oh, I’ve got to pickup a prescription and…. Uh... I don’t know, a couple other things, I don’t really remember what. 

No. Flippin. Way.  Jane NEVER does NOT know what she needs to get done.  Like the movie Inception, it was like the thought was planted in my mind: something is up.  I reached out to my 3 closest confidants, individually, telling what’s been written above.  All 3 responded with ‘dude, have you considered maybe she’s got something on the side?’

I ended up going and looking for the sex toys… she bought them, they arrived in March…..and I never saw them again.  So I went in the drawer that she normally keeps them that I’d get them from.  2 of the 4 were there.  I look through the rest and find them in other drawers, but also find implements of self-harm.  This totally freaked me out.

I went back to talk to a couple of close friends and also asked our couples’ therapist for a private session, which he agreed to.  I talked with him about it and agreed that it felt safest to bring it up in the next session on July 8.  I mentioned in that session ‘I found self-harm stuff, and it looked used.  Is this what I think it’s for?  Are you still doing this?  Are you okay?  Answer back was “Yes, yes, and yes.”  She pretty much shut down after that.

Jane wrote me this 2 hours after that after that session:

""Under  
very questionable concern, you not only violated my privacy but you then used  
that very suspect concern to discuss incredibly deeply personal and private  
things about me that I don’t share because I want them private with a whole  
bunch of people. Right now I feel extremely violated. I am hurt beyond words. I  
feel enraged, I feel horrified by you and at what you have done. I can not  
believe what you have taken from me. At this very moment I feel like if I ever  
see you again it will be too soon. Who the fuck are you that you would treat  
another person like this?”

I responded with: “I’ve read your message, and I’m really sorry for how I’ve made you feel.  I did not intend to cause pain, but I can see that I’ve crossed a line.  I’m understanding why you’re upset and want to own that.  I’m committed to learning from this and respecting your privacy.  When/if you want, I’m here to talk.""

She told me she was leaving at the next session. July 15^(th).

We had a family wedding to go about 10 days later that we had flights and hotels and all that.  I mentioned ‘I might like to just go with the kids, get a little breathing room.’  She said ‘If’ I’m not going, we have to tell the kids what’s going on.’  I was not ready for that at all.  We then had a soft moment a few days later and she was sad and really wanted to go and said she loved my family.  She was like ‘do you want me to go?’ and I said ‘of course I want you to go’ and I agreed.

Before we left we had a chat on July 19^(th) and she said she’d exit our business that we had together.  She said ‘you started it and came up with the name.  I’ll exit and start my own thing.’  I told her I was happy to help her get that setup and do all the technical stuff, since I’m the one that’s good at that stuff.  I noted to her when we were chatting there that it was the first time I noticed she wasn’t wearing her rings.  She said she hadn’t been for a few weeks, that they were hurting her finger… but I do believe I had seen her with her rings on more recently than that.

We left on that wedding trip six days later.  She put her wedding rings back on for the trip to keep up appearances, I guess.  She danced one dance with me at the wedding and then snuck away.  I found her outside talking to someone when I went to look for her about 45 minutes later. 

We got back from the wedding trip and she took her rings back off.

We had a chat and she said she was just feeling super overwhelmed with everything.  I received this as a window to heal and really put my best foot forward.  I always put my best foot forward, but I do realize that sometimes I can be a bit needy and selfish, thinking that the amount of work I do to provide allots me flexibility to take some time for myself.  I’m a bit more traditional in that way, and we had slipped into those lanes over the 20 years of our marriage. 

In couples therapy, she starts to mention feeling worried about the kids safety when she’s not around ‘to protect them.’  We’ve never had any physical issues in our home, and we both love our kids deeply.  We’re not a spanking family, we don’t hit.  We get frustrated with our kids sometimes, and we’ve each raised our voices, but we always talk to our kids, explain and speak to them to reach understanding.  I feel’we're both good parents.

An aside: about 2 years ago, at this point (August, so… August of ’23) she had revealed in our therapy that she had gone through some terrible physical and sexually violent abuse when she was 16-18.  Essentially, she was routinely raped and beat-up by her boyfriend, breaking up and getting back together with her repeatedly.  This manifested as coming up in dreams, and she started journaling about it, and then decided to turn it into a fictional book, but told me ‘80% of the events are exactly as they happened, and 100% of the emotional content is mine.’  She published it as her first novel in February 2025.  It’s an amazing book.  She’s an amazing writer.  It was around the time of that publishing, looking back at things, that these changes in her manifested… and I misread them.

I took the kids for a trip to Santa Cruz while she went to visit her family (her parents are older and not doing well.). Before that trip I told her “I need to try to match where you’re at, so I’m going to take my rings off as well, just to see how it feels.”  I took them off and left them home for the trip.  I really missed having them on and wished I never did that.

Fast forward to end of August.  It’s been about 6 weeks since she told me she was leaving, and about 4 weeks since she mentioned how overwhelmed she was feeling.  I had been journaling, reading Dr. Glover’s ‘No More Mr. Nice Guy’ and really working on my abandonment issues.  I really felt I was turning a corner on controlling my reactions to things, pausing before reacting, and owning whatever the result happened to be.  I knew this was my cycle: Life happens (but I’d selfishly just think it was happening TO me and me alone), I’d react to this, there’d be a result, and repeat.  Now, I’d usually react out of feeling abandoned, and defend the result… so there’d always be this extra step of conversation that my wife felt was laden with overexplaining and defensiveness.  Sure, sometimes, but… this was changing.  Issues like this that would take a day or two to resolve were turning into me, five minutes after any incident recognizing it, identifying it, apologizing, and explaining how I’d like to improve… then, I started to notice that incidents weren’t even occurring.  I was catching myself.  Improvement, I thought.

So, we’re in our couples’ therapy the week before Labor Day, and I’m saying “it’s been about a month since Jane told me about feeling overwhelmed, wanting to ‘act like we had the goal in mind’, etc. and I’ve been working hard to integrate what I’m hearing from her, adjust my reactions, and just be more solid and stable… but I’m not feeling anything back from her.  It’s like she’s still leaving.” 

Her response “I don’t know what you’re saying… I’ve always had the same mindset of leaving.”  What?  “But, you said you were feeling overwhelmed and confused??”  Pause.  “Yes, I was feling overwhelmed and confused by the logistics of getting divorced, that’s all.”

Gut punch is an understatement.  It was like getting left all over again.  Head in hands, sobbing, I’m saying things like “I’m such a fool.  I totally misread that.  I’ve failed you here and I’m so sorry.”

A few days later, I’m still floored, and I turn to her in the house “Is this really it?  Are we done?  I don’t want this at all.  Is there anything we can do?  Can we please try to heal together?”

Her response “I invite you to show me you’ve changed.”

And that was the mantra for September.  I’d be working well with her, then we’d have a little tiff, I’d fall on my sword and course correct quickly, and think we’re OK.  In therapy I’d always answer ‘so, how are you doing?’ with ‘I think each week is getting better!’ and she’d answer with ‘just when I think there might be a little hope, he destroys it all.  I can’t trust him.  I’m just not seeing any change.’

End of September, I’m at my tattered frills of emotional stability.  I’ve been ‘trying’ so hard for 2.5 months.  She’s steadfast and unmoving, still leaving me but with zero plan, we’re co-parenting in our home like roommates that wish they’d never signed that lease together.  I mentioned ‘so, what are we doing here?  I feel like there’s progress, and only get negativity back.  It’s really hard to feel like you’re healing when both people aren’t equally invested in this.’  Her response was ‘what, do you need a cheerleader to tell you ‘you’re doing great!’?’  to which I replied ‘no, but feeling like we’re both in it with the same goal of coming together and healing is important.  I don’t think we can feel if you have one foot out the door all the time.’

I had already talked to a couple of divorce attorneys a couple months earlier, when I got freaked out by her bringing up feeling that the kids would be unsafe with me alone.  I had a long chat with a good older friend that had gone through a similar situation.  He kinda of sealed it in my heart that my next move was to start listening to my wife.  “She’s saying she’s done and she’s leaving.  Believe her.  If you don’t start believing that you’re doing to start damaging yourself, and some of that is hard to reverse.  It’s time to call one of those two attorneys you liked.”

So, I did.  I. retained one… and then the panic started. 

First 3 weeks of October I barely slept.  I lost 20 pounds in a little over 2 weeks.  I’d rest for a couple minutes and wake in a panic sweat, 24/7.  It was a nightmare.  I started having some dark dark thoughts.  Jane had a trip planned to Louisville to support the book she self-published.  When she left it was at it’s worst.  I almost felt that I’d need to knock on the neighbor’s door and have them come watch the kids so I could go to the hospital.  Fortunately I was able to get a friend on the phone in the middle of the night that chatted with me and helped me feel better.  I went to the doctor and got prescribed Xanax, but I never filled the prescription.  I was too sure that I’d feel too good and get too easily accustomed to that feeling, and not want to stop.  I read a lot about rebound self-harm that happens a couple weeks after starting to take those types of medication.  I looked up alternatives, I used my own medicine (remember, I’m a doctor), I called friends to chat, I talked to my therapist.  I journaled, started to exericise, meditate more, forced myself to eat, all that. 

And things have gotten better since.  I’ve served her papers and my sleep didn’t get worse.  I’m sleeping ‘okay’ now, but still scared to go back to drinking coffee or anything.  My weight bounced back up a little, and I’m not so tired all day.  The sweats and absolutely terror-panic is gone.  I look back and think that those 3 weeks were my body physically manifesting absolutely denial of the situation. 

I stood in front of anniversary cars on October 30^(th), our 20 year anniversary.  I held a sappy ‘can we give it one more shot?’ card and realized ‘this no longer applies.  We’re past this.’  I got her a card that said ‘just breathe’ and wrote a nice note in it about how this is really hard, messy, and not what I wanted, but I understand her point of view and care about that for her.  I told her I’d always love her but I realize that it’ll change to appreciating her for the children we have together, and the rest will fade away. 

And now, we have to tell our kids.  I know they know.  They see Dad sad a lot.  They know that Mommy and Daddy argue.  One of them heard us talking about lawyers.  More is caught than is taught.  I’m terrified of telling them what’s going on.  And I’m just scared.

I’d like to dilute it and have more coffee flavour. So I wonder if this would work;  add some ice/cold coffee with the cream/milk before adding the slushy mix stuff.  Not sure of the ratios that would work but I was thinking a little more coffee and a little less slushy mix stuff. Then run it through the mixer machine. 

I’ve never worked at a Tim’s so don’t know what the steps are really or what the measurements are.  

I would also like a cold/iced decaf coffee 😆 then we could add this to my ice Capp. 

Any thoughts or other ideas to make it less sweet?
And please don’t say to stop going there cause I usually only go once a week and it’s winter now so it will be less.

chatted on the app for about 5 days before he offered me his # and invited me to text him. Things were going great conversationally so I agreed and texted right away. Another couple days of phone texting, and he wants to meet up. He says he’s free Sunday and suggests a meet up in a public place, do I know any nice parks? I say I do, but after checking the weather and seeing that it was supposed to be very cold and windy that day, I suggest we meet up at a coffee shop down the street from the park, just in case it’s too cold to walk outside. He agrees. We meet and I can tell instantly that there is a good vibe. We are waiting in line at the coffee shop conversing pleasantly and then it’s our turn to order. He immediately makes a little move behind me and takes a few steps back. I think ok, I guess that means we are ordering separately. So I pay for my $3 latte and the rest of the date goes great. He did mention getting ghosted on a few occasions, and that a few woman had been rude to him, but without context as to why. It seemed odd at the time because he was so easygoing. I had mentioned the day before that I was making a loaf of sourdough, and he had jokingly said that I “owed him a slice”, so I brought some and gave it to him at the end of the date. He texted shortly after saying that he was interested in getting to know me more and I replied with the same. I never mentioned what happened at the coffee shop or him not offering to pay for my coffee because honestly, I didn’t think it was a big deal. I can afford my own coffee and I would never expect someone to pay for me. Later that night he randomly says verbatim;
“I’m willing to pay for meals or not. I have zero preference.Others have strong opinions one way or the other, and even inquiring about their preference can seem to lead to hard feelings. I appreciated how you just stepped in front of me and made it clear you got yours without creating an awkward situation.” Idk why but him implying that I would “create an awkward situation” really rubbed me the wrong way.

Basically both start with high and even extraction at the surface, flat bottomed have an even reduction as you go deeper in the bed, while going down in a conical the extraction stays higher in the middle getting lower at the sides.

This got me thinking maybe a conical sieve or something to hold the grounds in a hollow cone during brewing might be able to achieve more even extraction.

**Why This Prop?**

Norman Powell has been a beacon of reliability this past few weeks for the Miami Heat – and it certainly doesn’t hurt that sports book thinks this game is going to land around a staggering 244.0 points (and it absolutely should). Powell has bagged at least 32 Points, Assists & Rebounds in 4 of his last 5 outings; I expect he’ll be a massive contributor in this evening’s game. My money’s on Powell to land on the North side of 30.5.

* Set against the backdrop of a traveling circus during the Great Depression, Water for Elephants tells a tale of love, resilience, and hope in the face of hardship. The story follows Jacob Jankowski, a young man who finds himself working among circus performers and animals, discovering both the beauty and the heartbreak of life under the big top.
* Jordan High School’s theatre program was selected for this honor following a meeting between the show’s writers, PigPen Theatre Company, and Jordan’s theatre director, Olivia Bellido, at the EdTA Awards. At the event, where Bellido was honored as the ASCAP Steven Schwartz Musical Theatre Teacher of the Year, the writers had the opportunity to view footage of her acclaimed productions.

The problem is, I'm an overthinker. We usually text each other quite often but it has been 3 days since we talked (i dont think this is important tho). Previously, I was sure that he had no one he liked, but today, I saw him liking a video on instagram about having a crush. I'm pretty sure it's not me tho.

He was gambling. He lied about everything from his finances to where he slept at night. The breakup was ugly and honestly traumatizing.

My mom liked him. Or… she liked the version of him he presented.

After we broke up, I told her everything. She cried with me, told me I deserved better, swore she was done with him too.

Fast forward to last week. My mom showed up at my place acting weirdly excited and anxious. She sat on my couch like she was about to deliver the best news of my life.

She said, “I had coffee with Luke today.”

I genuinely thought I misheard.

She continued talking like it was NOTHING. She said they’d been “catching up” for a few months. That he’s changed. That he’s sober. That he’s been going to therapy. And that he told her he still loves me.

Then she said the wildest thing I have ever heard come out of her mouth:

“I think you should give him another chance. I already told him I think you might.”

I felt physically sick.

I asked her how long this had been going on. She admitted they had been texting on and off for over a year, and meeting in person for the last few months. She hid all of this from me. She said she “didn’t want to influence my feelings until she knew he was really a better man.”

I said, “You went behind my back to my abusive ex, and now you’re trying to push him back into my life?”

She said I was being dramatic.

We haven’t spoken in five days. She keeps texting that she “just wants me to be happy” and that “love is rare and I shouldn’t be stubborn.”

My sister is furious on my behalf and told me Mom has always had a “weird need to fix things” but this is next-level.

I feel betrayed. I feel unsafe. I feel like I can’t trust my own mother.

1ozm4pt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roleplay/comments/1ozm4pt/a_totally_euphoric_story_trans/,A Totally Euphoric Story (Trans),"Heya, thank you for reading this! Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good!

I get that it has a decent cast of characters and he ended up renting out a camera for six weeks (originally meant to be one weekend, but everyone in this sub knows that never goes according to plan), but I just feel generally shocked that this kind of picture cost that kind of money.

## Paper Instance: Democracy Without Wi-Fi

**November 17, 2025** | Dev Log #001

-----

## What We Built

**Senatai now works on paper.**

Not as a backup. Not as an afterthought. As a **primary access method** for people who don’t use smartphones, don’t trust apps, or don’t have reliable internet.

You can participate in democracy by:

- Filling out surveys printed in newspapers
- Mailing them to us (or emailing a photo)
- Receiving your Policap balance and dividends via postal mail
- Never touching a computer

-----

## Why Paper Matters

**15-20% of Canadians don’t use internet regularly.** If Senatai only works digitally, we’ve replicated the same exclusion we’re trying to fix.

Elderly people. Rural communities. Privacy-conscious folks. People with disabilities who prefer large print. Incarcerated people who can’t access internet. **If your vote requires a smartphone, you’ve already decided who gets to participate.**

Paper is:

- **Accessible** - Works for everyone, regardless of tech literacy or income
- **Trustworthy** - Physical mail feels real in a way apps don’t
- **Resilient** - Can’t be censored by app stores, ISPs, or platform bans
- **Auditable** - Creates paper trail that governments/institutions respect
- **Bridging** - Elders use paper, youth use apps, both participate equally

-----

## How It Works

### 1. Distribution

- **Newspaper inserts** ( surveys on current bills)
- **Direct mail** (quarterly survey packets)
- **Physical handouts** (van fleet, community centers, libraries)
- **Trifold pamphlets** (leave at MP offices, co-op stores)
- **Question-a-day calendars** (mail in quarterly or yearly)

### 2. Completion

User fills out survey with pen/pencil:

- 1 impact question (how does this affect you?)
- 3 values questions (underlying principles)
- 1 specific question (actual bill details)
- Simple addition = predicted vote (user can audit with yes/no override)

### 3. Submission

Two paths:

- **Traditional mail** - Stamp, envelope, mailbox (address: 642 17th Ave N, Kenora ON P9N 3N4)
- **QR code email** - Scan code, photo survey, send to surveys@senatai.ca (no stamp needed)

### 4. Processing

We receive → scan with high-DPI scanner → OCR extracts data → manual verification → credit Policaps → mail response packet

### 5. Response

User receives:

- Account statement (Policap balance, dividend updates)
- 5 new surveys (personalized based on previous answers)
- Return envelope for next submission
- Trust fund dividend check (once fund matures)

-----

## The First Survey: Ford’s Speed Camera Ban

Our first paper survey addresses **Ontario’s speed camera ban** (passed Nov 14, 2025).

**Why this issue:**

- Happened THIS WEEK (maximally current)
- Everyone has an opinion (drivers, parents, pedestrians)
- Low stakes (traffic fines, not life-or-death)
- Clear controversy (mayors, police, SickKids vs Ford)
- Real data (45% speeding reduction, $45M in fines, woman got 17 tickets in 12 days)

**The survey tests a simple prediction algorithm:**

- Add up scores from Q2-Q5
- Score 4-10 = likely support Ford’s ban
- Score 11-14 = unsure
- Score 15-20 = likely oppose Ford’s ban
- User confirms or overrides prediction

**This is our first “prediction module”** - just addition, no machine learning. We’re testing whether simple math can predict political positions. If it works at 60%+ accuracy, we’ve validated the concept.

-----

## The Design Philosophy: Low-Res Digital

The QR code on our paper surveys includes a **24×24px pixelated Senatai logo** in the center.

This is intentional.

**Paper Senatai is low-res Digital Senatai.**

It’s slower. It’s less convenient. It’s analog. But it works when digital fails. It includes people digital excludes. It creates trust digital can’t replicate.

The pixelated logo signals: “This is rough. This is accessible. This is democracy for everyone, not just people with $1,000 phones.”

-----

## Technical Architecture

### Mail Depot Operations

**Hardware:**

- High-DPI scanner (art documentation scanner, already owned)
- Windows laptop (scanner drivers don’t support Linux yet)
- Home printer + ink subscription
- Free paper (discarded reams from local schools)

**Software:**

- Tesseract OCR (open source, checkbox recognition)
- Python scripts (watch folder → extract data → flag for verification)
- SQLite database (track users, Policaps, responses)

**Workflow:**

1. Daily mail check (PO Box or home address)
1.  scan surveys 
1. OCR + manual verification (15-30 min for 30 surveys)
1. Database update (credit Policaps)
1. Generate response packets (print new surveys + statements)
1. Mail out (weekly batches)

**Staff (initially):** Just me (founder), 30 min/day
**Staff (at 1,000 paper users):** 1 part-time processor, 10-15 hours/week
**Staff (at 10,000 paper users):** Full mail depot with 3-5 people

### Cost Per User

**Digital user (at scale):** $0.89-1.78/year (cloud hosting, DevOps, engineers)
**Paper user (always):** $12.10/year (postage, printing, processing labor)

**But:**

- Digital requires massive upfront investment 
- Paper requires $300/year (printer + ink, equipment already owned)
- Paper bootstraps to 1,000 users for $3,000 total


**Paper has lower barrier to entry and predictable linear scaling.**

-----

## Why This Changes Everything

### For Pitch Meetings

**Old pitch:** “We need $100k to build a civic tech platform.”
**Investor thinks:** “Risky, complex, lot of unknowns.”

**New pitch:** “We have working paper infrastructure operating TODAY. We need $100k to scale it and add digital.”
**Investor thinks:** “Wait, they’re already operational? This is proof-of-concept funding, not R&D.”

### For Partnerships

**Métis Nation:** “Elders can participate via mail, youth via app. Both earn shares. Both receive dividends. No digital divide.”

**Rural newspapers:** “We’ll provide free weekly ‘Vote of the Week’ column with survey. You get content, we get distribution.”

**Community organizations:** “Hand out surveys at your events. Your members participate, you get data showing community positions.”

### For Legitimacy

**App-only platforms feel like Silicon Valley extraction.**
**Paper + digital feels like actual infrastructure.**

When you can walk into a meeting with a stack of 100 printed surveys and say “I can process 1,000 paper users this month with equipment I already own,” you’re not pitching vaporware. You’re demonstrating working democratic infrastructure.

-----

## What’s Next

### Week 1-2: Pilot Test

- Print 50 surveys (home printer, free school paper)
- Distribute at library, co-op grocery, coffee shops
- Hand to friends/neighbors: “Ford just banned speed cameras. What do you think?”
- Target: 10-20 returns

### Week 3-4: Process & Iterate

- Scan returns, test OCR accuracy
- Measure prediction algorithm (does addition work?)
- Mail response packets
- Refine survey design based on feedback

### Month 2: Newspaper Partnerships

- Pitch “Vote of the Week” column to 3 rural weeklies
- 5,000-10,000 circulation per paper
- Expected 1-3% return rate = 150-900 responses
- Publish aggregate results in following week’s column

### Month 3-6: Mail Depot Formalization

- Rent small office space or use Workshop location
- Hire part-time processor (10-15 hours/week)
- Set up postage-paid return permits (Canada Post)
- Target: 500-1,000 active paper users

### Month 7-12: Hybrid System

- Launch digital platform (app + website)
- Users can switch between paper/digital freely
- Policaps sync across both
- Some users stay paper-only, some transition, some use both

-----

## The Long-Term Vision

**Year 5:**

- 50,000 paper users
- 200,000 digital users
- 10 mail depots (one per Workshop location)
- Paper surveys in 50+ newspapers
- Question-a-day calendars in 10,000 homes
- Trust fund paying meaningful dividends 

**Paper users will:**

- Be disproportionately elderly, rural, low-income
- Generate the MOST valuable data (underrepresented demographics)
- Build trust that attracts digital users (“my grandma uses this, it’s legit”)
- Prove Senatai is genuine infrastructure, not a tech grift

-----

## Technical Debt We’re Accepting

**Manual processing is slow.** At 10,000 paper users, we’ll need sophisticated OCR, automated verification, and 5-10 depot staff.

**Postage is expensive.** We’re exploring:

- Postage-paid permits (one-time $200 fee, then free returns)
- Partnerships with Canada Post (civic infrastructure discount?)
- Regional depot networks (reduce mailing distances)

**Paper can’t do real-time.** Digital users get instant feedback. Paper users wait days/weeks. That’s okay. Democracy doesn’t need to be instant.

**Scaling is linear, not exponential.** 100k paper users = 10 depots, 50 staff, $1.2M/year operating costs. That’s a feature, not a bug. It creates jobs. It builds local infrastructure. It’s democracy as economic development.

-----

## Why “Low-Res Digital” Matters

High-resolution promises are bullshit.

“We’ll use AI to revolutionize democracy!”
“We’ll create perfect citizen engagement!”
“We’ll solve polarization with algorithms!”

**Bullshit.**

Democracy is messy, slow, imperfect, and human. Paper Senatai embraces that.

- 24×24px pixelated logo (rough, accessible)
- Checkbox bubbles like Scantron tests (familiar, simple)
- Addition as prediction algorithm (transparent, auditable)
- Postal mail at stamp prices (unglamorous, reliable)

**Low-res doesn’t mean low-quality. It means honest about what we are:**

Infrastructure. Not magic. Infrastructure that works when you’re 75 and don’t trust smartphones. Infrastructure that works in rural Manitoba where internet is $200/month. Infrastructure that works when the power’s out and the app store is censoring you.

1ozlvxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1ozlvxb/how_to_understand_people_faster_than_they/,"How to understand people faster than they understand themselves: the ultimate cheat code from psychology, sales, & therapy","I kept noticing this weird flex people have on TikTok lately: “I can read people like a book.” But when you really listen, all they’re doing is projecting, labeling others based on vibes, or trauma-dumping. Most of it is shallow pop psych content: zodiac signs, aesthetic-core profiling, “if they choose iced coffee at night it means they’re emotionally unavailable.”  

But the truth? Actually understanding people, like, really grasping what drives them, their fears, patterns, blindspots, values, is scary accurate *and* incredibly learnable. It’s not about being manipulative or guessing. It’s about observing, listening, pattern recognition, and psychology-backed decoding.  

This post is for anyone who’s ever wanted to get better at reading people, whether you're trying to build better relationships, improve leadership skills, succeed in sales, or just not get played. I’ve dug deep into therapy methods, negotiation psychology, evolutionary biology, and behavioral economics to bring you real tools. No fluff, no cosmic energy takes. Just practical stuff that actually works.

1. **Watch the gaps between what people say and what they do**  
This is the #1 diagnostic tool great therapists use. People don’t always lie, but they often hide, and that hiding shows up in the disconnect between words and actions. Someone who says “I hate drama” but constantly picks fights or “I value honesty” but dodges accountability? That’s the gold.  

Harvard psychologist Dr. Daniel Gilbert’s research on affective forecasting shows people are often wrong about their own future emotional states. So if you’re paying attention to behavior, especially under stress, you’ll often understand their real values faster than they do.

2. **Ask questions that reveal patterns, not opinions**  
Instead of asking “What do you believe about X?” ask “What do you do when Y happens?” People will filter less when talking about behavior. “What’s the last thing that made you feel disrespected?” reveals more than “What are your values at work?”  

This is the basis of tactical empathy used in hostage negotiation, popularized by former FBI negotiator Chris Voss in *Never Split The Difference*. He teaches that emotional labeling and strategic silence can surface someone’s true psychology way faster than persuasion.

3. **Notice what people are proud of, and what they avoid**  
We’re all curating constantly. But the way people frame their stories, their little humblebrags, their deflections? That’s where the real stuff is. Someone who jokes about being “too intense” or “bad with boundaries” isn’t just joking. These are socially acceptable leaks of deeper fears or behaviors.

Robert Greene calls this “strategic vulnerability”, when people let you see one part of the mask to hide another. If you track these patterns across time and context, you’ll start seeing repeating scripts.

4. **Understand that most people run on loops**  
Psychotherapist Barry Michels (co-author of *The Tools*) said, “People don’t have problems, they have patterns.” This hits hard. Once you see someone’s go-to defense mechanisms (avoidance, people-pleasing, deflection, blame), they start to become predictable.

Behavioral economist Dan Ariely’s experiments also show that decisions are rarely logical, they’re habitual, emotional, or social. So if someone keeps choosing chaotic partners or self-sabotaging at work? It’s not accidental. It’s a loop. Spot the loop. You’ll see the person more clearly than they do.

5. **Try to make learning addictive**  
If you want to sharpen your people-reading game, don’t just scroll dating advice TikToks. You need deep pattern exposure, real case studies, therapy sessions, research-backed frameworks.  

One app I recommend is *Noah AI*. It feeds you curated content from real psychology and business bestsellers, packaged into scenarios. It’s like learning human behavior through immersive flashcards. Great if you're into sales, coaching, leadership or just figuring out relationships.

6. **BeFreed**  
Once you’re ready to go deeper, I started using this AI-powered learning app called BeFreed. It builds you a custom study roadmap based on your interests, psychology, communication, behavior change. It pulls from actual experts, podcasts, and books (like the ones I recommend below), then turns them into short audio sessions in your preferred voice and tone.  

What makes it powerful? It adapts over time. So the more you listen, the smarter it gets about what *you* I need to learn. Choose between 10, 20, or 40-minute episodes, and yes, it tracks your patterns too. The app literally helped me replace 20 minutes of doom-scrolling with high-yield learning.

And get this, BeFreed covers almost every resource recommended below. I highly recommend weaving in 10 minutes a day. Small habit, huge compounding insight. You’ll see how fast you start mapping people without even thinking.

7. **This book will make you question your entire understanding of other people**  
*The Laws of Human Nature* by Robert Greene is an insanely good read. It’s 600+ pages but reads like a chess manual for decoding people. Greene (known for *48 Laws of Power*) blends history, psychodynamics, and behavioral science. If you ever wanted to understand manipulation, projection, envy, repression, this is it.  

After reading it, I started noticing game dynamics in conversations I thought were casual. You’ll never look at power, relationships, or even small talk the same way again. Probably the best “how to read people” book I’ve ever read.

8. **Deepen emotional fluency**  
Try *Where Should We Begin* by Esther Perel (podcast). She’s a relationship therapist, and the podcast is actual recorded therapy sessions. You hear the real-time peeling-back of layers. Helps you tune your emotional radar and understand how people protect themselves.

Each episode is a masterclass in decoding language, defenses, and tone. If you want to learn how people reveal their inner lives without realizing it, this is the place.

9. **Use this YouTube channel if you want to spot deception or manipulation**  
The *Charisma on Command* The channel breaks down speeches, interviews, and celebrity behavior. It’s pop psych but surprisingly accurate when it comes to identifying persuasion tactics, power dynamics, and charisma. Great if you want visual, example-based learning.

They even covered shows like *Succession* and broke down real-time power plays. It trains you to watch micro-expressions and subtext, not just listen to the words.

10. **Learn the frameworks that therapists use**  
*The Psychology of Personality* by David Watson on Coursera is a no-nonsense class on understanding the core models behind how personalities form and evolve, from attachment theory to Big Five traits. Free if you audit. This isn’t content farming. It's an actual structure you can apply.

The truth is, once you absorb enough of these frameworks, everyone you meet starts to feel legible. You’ll start to *see* people way before they explain themselves.  

And ironically? That’s when you become someone people feel deeply safe around, because they finally feel seen.",1,1763399310.0,BetterAtPeople,0,1.0,False

And it surprised me because, as a self-declared amateur coffee snob, I have always found the opposite.

I made a couple of suggestions, such as Proper Order in Dublin (to be fair, I haven't been in a couple of years), and they said they'd been there (Proper Order)and were disappointed in what they were served. 

They then gave me a couple of places in Liverpool that they'd had their better coffee experiencea (I'm from Liverpool, just live in Ireland) and I'd never heard of them but have added them to my list of places to try.

Anyway, what I'm trying to ask with this post is, for those of you who take coffee seriously and who have experience of drinking in third wave coffee shop type places in both countries, would you agree with this American that the UK has better coffee than here in Ireland?

Because, for me, the coffee over this side of the sea has been overwhelmingly better. But then, maybe I just don't have the pallette to judge it properly...

For me, it’s gotta be my old ThinkPad from college. That thing went through three moves, countless all-nighters, and somehow survived being in my backpack with like twenty textbooks on top. The keyboard still works better than half the newer laptops I’ve used, and it boots up faster than my motivation some mornings.

I’m not expecting miracle machines, but it’s always wild to see how some laptops just seem built like tanks compared to others that feel like they’d break if you looked at them wrong.

Well, I don't know even how to start this. Officially I'm diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome and Mixed Addiction Syndrome. Since I've gotten clean I'm more conscious in general.

I've moved from my mom's place a few weeks ago and I'm feeling a lot of loneliness. I'm trying to get in contact with the outside world, but it's so hard to be honest.

When I'm thinking about calling some acquaintances my mind is getting flooded with a lot of thoughts like: What if they don't have time for a chat? What if I'll interrupt whatever they're doing? Maybe they don't want to talk with me? We aren't that close, so why should I call them? After that usually I'm not calling them.

When I eventually call someone or meet someone (that happens sometimes when I go to the NA meeting) and I am in conversation with someone, then I have another flood of thoughts like: I have to watch out not to talk about your interests, they probably don't want to listen about Linux or other crap. Am I appropriate? Do I act normal? What if they talk with me only because they want to be polite and not reject me? Often I don't even know how to answer to people in an understandable way.

Lately I ran into old friend from high school when I was walking to the shop. When we caught up I invited him over for a cup of coffee. He said he'd be available in two weeks. During this time I was often thinking about calling him just to talk, but every time I didn't end up calling him because of the thoughts I explained before. We ended up meeting eventually but it was because he texted me two days before the visit confirming if my invite was still a thing. If he hadn't confirmed I'm 100% sure that this meeting wouldn't have happened.

Lately it is a struggle to do life on my own without anyone on my side to talk or share with my experience. I'm writing this post just to vent a little, but if anyone here has been through something similar I'd like to hear your experience and how you made your situation better. I'm going to talk about it tomorrow with my addiction therapist, but also I'd like to hear the perspective from fellow neuroatypical people.",2,1763398980.0,aspergers,0,1.0,False

1ozlpcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/IRLCommunityBuilding/comments/1ozlpcr/irl_community_marketing_is_the_future_and_we_are/,IRL community marketing is the future! And we are only just getting started!,"Hi everyone, here are a few thoughts from my coffee break.  
  
For the past three years, I’ve been reading nonstop about “how to make friends as an adult,” “IRL social,” “offline communities,” “IRL apps,” “friend-making apps,” and the growing loneliness in Gen Z and Y. I built several projects. Some failed, others succeeded.

We’re witnessing a fascinating but quiet shift.  
Young people are more connected than ever, yet lonelier than ever. The pattern is familiar: school, university, work, then home… and straight onto the phone again. An endless stream of content that keeps us entertained, but doesn’t make us feel anything real.

Social media today delivers everything except genuine connection.

What used to be “social” is now just entertainment. Conversations have turned into reactions, memes, and quick emojis. Sharing your personal life on your profile is no longer cool. At most, a few fleeting stories. Influencers have become permanent ad channels. The trust is gone.

At the same time, parasocial relationships are skyrocketing. Twitch, streaming, creator culture: since COVID they have become the constant companion in people’s daily lives. They provide the feeling of closeness and belonging. But it is one-way attention. Dopamine instead of connection.

Creators say, “Take care of yourself and your friends, but please keep watching.” A contradiction we all feel. And all of it fueled by unchecked smartphone addiction. And this is exactly where the shift happens. More and more young people don’t want more content. They want people. Real people. In real life.

Run clubs are the best example. No fancy marketing. No influencer overload. Just show up, run, meet others. And it works because it provides what digital life cannot: authenticity, shared experiences, community.

IRL community-building and IRL-first marketing are not nostalgic ideas. They are a direct response from a generation that has realized virtual closeness does not fulfill the need for real connection.

Brands, creators, and companies that understand this are not just building reach. They are building trust, belonging, and long-term loyalty.

**The future belongs to those who create offline spaces, not just content.** In the next five years, we will see a wave of IRL-first apps designed to facilitate genuine human connection.

I might have had it earlier, but I was taking Vyvanse so I'm unsure (I noticed a spike in anxiety and intolerance to stress in May and June, so maybe it actually started then). Since realizing I have mono I slowly stopped taking Vyvanse because I noticed that I would get flare ups and brain fog if I took it (cause I would not notice fatigue). 

I haven't taken Vyvanse now for about two months. But honestly some days it's so hard. Without the dopamine from the meds, it feels like my brain has been sucked dry and I have very little motivation to do almost anything. I am working full time from home while I recover and I basically just do all the meetings I have to do and then go scroll for hours and eat sugary stuff (which I know is unhealthy). I also go for a walk everyday (6000 steps) while I slowly build up my tolerance for exercise. I tried to cut out coffee as well but only was successful for two weeks. It's so hard to cut out so many things.

Right now I have noticed that I tend to have about 3-6 symptom free hours a day, and the rest of the day my symptoms are at about a 3/10 in severity (mostly feeling dazed and unfocused, light headaches, and some mild body aches occasionally).

So tldr: ADHDers when did you start taking your meds again? When you were completely symptom free? ",1,1763398800.0,Mononucleosis,0,1.0,False

Unsure about it.,"My boyfriend (24m) and I (23m) have been dating for a year and a half. About a month and a half ago he found out his ex hookup was starting a job in the same city as him. He asked how I’d feel if he reached to her to get coffee and get “friendship closure” and I said it would make me uncomfortable and cross a boundary. He ended up texting her anyway on the day I was at a funeral. They got coffee a few days later and he gave her a ride home (didn’t tell me for several days bc he knew it would hurt me) and also learned that she also frequents places we enjoy going to in the city. I ended up breaking up with him over this, but now we’re trying to make things work.

I’ve been really struggling with intrusive thoughts of them in the coffee shop together, being intimate, and have terrible anxiety whenever I’m at the places he said she also goes to. This is mostly because of the feelings it would give rise to, not because I think it would be awkward. My OCD therapist said that a possible exposure/way around this is to “confront the monster” and invite her out with us so I can stop being so anxious in the city. I’m not sure how I feel about this and cannot imagine that making me feel good at all. I don’t know if my hesitation is just OCD making me incredibly avoidant or if this doesn’t align with my values and I would be torturing myself.

What are your thoughts? And is this OCD or a natural reaction to betrayal in a romantic relationship?

Some notes: she knows he has a girlfriend, she has a boyfriend now, and me and her actually know each other (we met once at a party a few years ago)

Is this how normal people go about their lives? This weekend I tackled things around the house that have been waiting for years. I finally framed my kids' school photos from LAST YEAR and hung them on the wall. This took all of 20 minutes but was impossible to accomplish until now. I look at things and just put them away. Like I can just DO things, it's not hard or exhausting. I don't need time to recover from things like chores or grocery shopping.

I have. Constantly. When I moved to a new city, I was paralyzed by safety anxiety. Every plan started with a dozen Google searches: ""is \[neighborhood\] safe at night,"" ""safe for solo women,"" etc. Friends gave conflicting advice, my parents were worried sick, and online forums were a mix of outdated posts and unhelpful ""I felt fine"" anecdotes.

Social media shows picture-perfect solo trips, but it never shows the reality of clutching your keys in your pocket or skipping an event because you're not sure how you'll get back alone.

I realized the information I needed didn't exist. Nobody tracks the data that *actually* matters: not which cafe has the best coffee, but whether you'll get harassed on the 10-minute walk there at 7 PM.

So, I decided to build the solution myself: **Safe or Not**.

1ozljgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1ozljgh/i_am_a_48_yr_old_alcoholic_i_dont_go_to_meetings/,I am a 48 yr old alcoholic. I don’t go to meetings,"My name is Joe, and for years, ""I am an alcoholic"", were the only honest words I refused to speak. Alcohol was the corrosive acid that ate away the foundation of my life until nothing but the dust of what I once was remained. It took the most catastrophic, agonizing losses for the fog to lift, revealing the true waste I was.

The collapse was agonizingly slow. I exchanged a successful career for the blurred oblivion of the bottle. Then friendships dissolved not with shouting, but with silence... ignored calls, the chilling realization that my presence was a liability, a toxic element to be avoided. They loved the man I used to be; they pitied or recoiled from the drunk I had become. The silence from my children was a silence that screamed. I became a drunken shadow. The pride I once saw in their eyes was replaced by embarrassment, fear, and a heartbreaking indifference. To have they very people who look to you to keep them safe sever ties for self-preservation... that is a cut that never truly heals. But even that pain was not enough to stop the self-destruction.

The final, fatal blow,the one that shattered the last, rickety pillar of my life was the loss of my wife. She was the anchor I leaned on so heavily, whose unwavering loyalty I took for granted. She shielded me, made excuses for me, and carried the impossible weight of our shared life. But even the strongest human spirit has a breaking point. When she packed her bags, her face was not etched with anger, but with an exhausted, profound sorrow. It was the absolute, heartbreaking recognition that she could not save me, and staying would only destroy her too. The emptiness she left was absolute. There was no one left to blame, no one left to lean on, and nowhere left to hide from the staggering reality of my solitude.

The ensuing days were a liquid blur of despair, broken only by the stark, terrifying clarity of the final, irreversible decision. I had reached the bottom. The reality of rock bottom is cold, filthy, and utterly desolate. It culminated in the moment I sat on the floor of my empty house, holding the means to end the overwhelming pain I had caused and the humiliation I felt.

The gun felt impossibly heavy, a cold, metallic promise of peace. Tears streamed down my face, hot and humiliating. I raised the barrel to my mouth, the oily steel tasted like a bitter confirmation of my failure. This is it, I thought. This is how I'll finally sleep.

And then, she was there. Pepper.
My dog. My constant, silent shadow. She laid down beside me and looked up at me with those vast, trusting brown eyes. They held no judgment...only pure, uncomplicated love and a simple, immediate need.
In that paralyzing instant, the sheer, sickening selfishness of my plan slammed into me. I couldn't just leave her. I couldn't just vanish and let her starve or wonder where I went. The monstrous thought flashed through my mind, a testament to how utterly broken I was... I’d have to do her first.

The thought was sick. I know it was sick. I wasn't well. I was a fractured, desperate man whose capacity for empathy had been reduced to a single creature of unconditional devotion. Maybe it was the fierce, gentle love in her eyes that softened the rigid pressure of my trigger finger; maybe it was something greater, a whisper of grace I was too cynical to believe in; maybe it was the sudden, raw terror that there might be hope, a terrifying chance that I could get better; or maybe, and most honestly, I was just too scared to pull the fucking trigger.
But whatever the reason, love, grace, fear, or a desperate reflex, I flung the gun away and it stuck in the living room wall, the sound a dull, flat echo in the ruins of my life. I hadn't ended my life, but the old one was dead anyway.

The next few days were a terrible purgatory. I suffered on the floor, surrounded by the remnants of my final, drunken, despairing breakdown. The agony of withdrawal...the shakes, the sweats, the nausea that left me retching with nothing left in my stomach, was the painful tax I had to pay for my years of abuse. I couldn't hold down a sip of water, let alone a cohesive thought.
I was utterly alone, except for my dog, who never left my side. Her need forced me, inch by inch, back toward movement. When the tremors subsided enough for me to hold down a cup of soup, I executed the one, terrifying, necessary action. I took myself to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. I had nothing better to do anyway.

The meeting felt better than a bar, though the clientele looked strangely the same... the broken eyes, the weary resignation that marks those who have fought a long, losing war. It was my first time. I sat quietly, soaking in the unfamiliar cadence of shared sorrow and shared hope. The reading spoke of humility and surrender. Something inside me clicked; I had a story to tell, a monumental, terrifying tale of near-suicide and rescue by my dog. 

When they called for newcomers, I raised a shaking hand, the single moment of truth hanging heavy in the room. I opened my mouth and said the words that up until that very moment I hadn't accepted.
""My name is Joe, and I'm an alcoholic.""But after that, no words came out.Only tears. Loud, relentless, agonizing sobs that were less about sadness and more about the violent, painful release of years of pent-up shame, denial, and crushing angst. I cried until my chest ached and my knees threatened to buckle, the tears pouring out not as a sign of weakness, but as the first, powerful, cleansing rain of my recovery. I was a man who had not cried in decades, and now I could not stop. The room didn't judge. It only offered tissues, and quiet, knowing acceptance. I was finally, profoundly, honest.

Naked.

It seems so long ago now, so far away. The man who sat on that floor with a gun, the man who wept uncontrollably in that basement... he feels like a stranger, a tragic character in a movie. Yet, that distance is the proof of the transformation.
I didn't wake up this morning with fanfare or fireworks. I haven't been counting the days, meticulously marking them off on a calendar. Counting days felt too much like waiting for the inevitable relapse. I just lived them. One tedious, sober 24 hours at a time. But as I drank my coffee this morning, I was seized by a quiet, profound awareness. Today was significant.
Today is the anniversary of that night on the floor, of the choice to live, of the walk to the basement meeting. Today, I've been sober for a year.

A YEAR!!!

Three hundred and sixty-five fucking days.
That number is not just a tally; it is a fortress I built out of the broken bricks of my past. It is a monument to every craving ignored, every painful truth spoken, and every sober choice made when the instinct was to reach for oblivion. And I did it for ME. This is the hardest, truest statement of all. Sure, my family may benefit, and the world may be a better place without me being all fucked up. But I had to strip away the toxic notion that I was only quitting for them. I made this choice for me. For my sanity. For the right to look in the mirror and not despise that asshole staring back. And I made it for my dog, who reminds me every day that I am worthy of love and loyalty.
This one year is not a finish line; it’s the solid ground beneath my feet. The journey of recovery is lifelong, but the victory of this first year is undeniable. 

I am Joe. I am an alcoholic. 

And today, I am a survivor, a builder, and a man learning, finally, how to live. The future is uncertain, but it is… through grit, completely sober. And that is everything.",65,1763398542.0,confession,16,0.9,False

I went back and watched all the Droyco scenes and he's either not real or it's a really good red herring and they don't want us to think he's real.

Mike finds Droyco's address, and they go to his house and knock on the door.  Door opens, Ron and Droyco talk, door closes.  If you watch Mike the whole time he looks bored like he's waiting for the door to open.  When the door closes, he shrugs and they leave, but his shrug is very consistent with a ""well I guess no one was home"" shrug.

A minute later Mike is saying he can watch the house for a few days and Ron is like but he's clearly leaving right now.  Then when Droyco shows up to Ron's work nobody else sees him.

The scene with the touch screen game in the bar is the same.  Mike never looks at Droyco.  Ron explains the touch screen game to Mike.  Mike looks bored the whole time and then plays the game while Ron and Droyco talk about returning poops to the sender.

I think it's also intentionally related to the scene where Mike approached Ron and Seth at the coffee shop and Seth clearly sees Mike and so it's like see these are real people there's no people being hallucinated by Ron.  Then we meet Droyco shortly after.

Anyway, it's very possible that Droyco doesn't exist.  I hope it's a red herring and he does.  If he's a hallucination, it's kind of been done before.  If it's a red herring and I just wasted my own time rewatching the scenes, it's brilliant.",3,1763398504.0,thechaircompany,1,1.0,False

When we were dating i knew he vaped and drinks alcohol. I recently learned he also uses weed. I only drink alcohol (socially, with him sometimes).
​My upbringing regarding drugs is viewing them in a negative way, and that view is still deeply ingrained in me. Beyond that, I don't like the smell of weed and vapes and do not want it on my clothes because I work in an office setting having to be face to face with clients.

​The Situation

​My boyfriend recently did a huge favor for his friend—he hid his friend's cats at his apartment and had a roommate of theirs stay over because they weren't on the lease for a few hours because of a maintenance check. Later that day, I was over at his place when the friend's girlfriend came to pick them up. As a thank you, she handed my boyfriend a small package bag face down on the coffee table. I was curious what it was so I picked it up to read it and it was weed.
​I instantly felt upset and might have made a visible negative face. My boyfriend made a joke that she is his drug dealer and it made me feel even worse. I know it's important to talk about it but I'm wondering if a relationship can continue when one partner uses substances while the other rarely does? The substance use is making me question the relationship

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I'm really interested in connecting with real people and experiencing the city from a local perspective.

A bit about me: I'm into fitness (it's kind of my meditation). I also love exploring new cafes and having genuine conversations. I speak 5 languages: English,Arabic, and French.

I'm a frequent traveler and have learned that some of the best travel experiences come from meeting locals who can share their authentic stories about their city.

What I'm looking for:

\- People who want to grab coffee or a beer and chat about life, work, travel, or whatever or someone who can help to discover around

\- Recommendations for local spots that aren't in the guidebooks

\- Genuine connections—I'm looking to make real friends, not just collect Instagram photos

I'm open to exploring whatever the city has to offer and adapting to what locals think is worth experiencing. Whether it's a random walk through a neighborhood, a specific event, or just hanging out, I'm flexible and genuinely interested in getting to know the city through the people who live here.

1ozl7zg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ozl7zg,"Guangzhou, Chongqing, Zhangjiajie, Yangshuo - China (October 2025) | Pictures, Tips, Visas","I went on a trip through some of the popular places in China during October 2025, in this post, I will try to give all the information I wish I had before I took the trip. 

Firstly a description of all the images:

1. *Canton Tower, Guangzhou*
2. *20 Yuan Note Viewpoint - Li River, Xingping, Guilin*
3. *Yulong Bridge, Yangshuo*
4. *Escooter to rent in Yangshuo (almost every hotel has them)* 
5. *Karst Mountains, Yangshuo*
6. *Ruyi Peak Cableway Scenic Area, Yangshuo*
7. *Cave Cafe near Romance Park, Yangshuo*
8. *Tianzi Mountain, Zhangjiajie National Forest Park*
9. *Bailong Elevator, Zhangjiajie National Forest Park*
10. *Avatar Hallelujah Mountain, Zhangjiajie National Forest Park*
11. *72 Strange Buildings, Zhangjiajie*
12. *Chongqing Art Museum, Chongqing*
13. *Hongyadong, Chongqing*
14. *Jiefangbei Pedestrian Street, Chongqing*
15. *Ciqikou Ancient Town, Chongqing*
16. *Luckin Coffee, Everywhere in China*

The pictures are all in the order that things happen, so they give you a rough idea of my itinerary. I spent around 17 days in China. I went to Guangzhou for the Canton fair and extended my trip to see a few places in this incredible country. 

**Apps and bookings-**

None of the common apps like Google, Instagram, and Booking\[dot\]com would be of any use in China because of the great firewall. To get around it and stay connected to the outside world you should buy and install a good VPN on your devices before arriving. I bought **Astrill VPN** and it worked fine. The best thing you can do is to get a **china travel e-sim from Trip\[dot\]com** it is super easy to install and will give you access to all of your regular apps and chinese stuff, it is also relatively cheap. 

For navigation within China use **AMaps** or Apple Maps and set the language to english. You would still need to search for things in chinese after translating. It is what it is. 

For payments I suggest you set up **Alipay** and **WechatPay** they work literally everywhere. Credit cards are generally not accepted anywhere except few places. Although cash is not common, you should always carry cash with you for emergencies; I recommend keeping **2000CNY** with you at all times just in case your payment apps do not work.

For Hotel, Trains, Flights and Attraction bookings, [**Trip.com**](http://Trip.com) is your go to place. It is the best app to book everything. You will find the best deals here and the support is also nice and responsive. I booked everything using it and I can not recommend it enough. 

For local taxis you can use **DiDi**, it is super cheap and works no matter when and where you are. 

For translation, Apple Translate is your way to go. Use the conversation feature and you are good to go. If you do not speak Chinese then this is an app that you definitely need.

  
**Budget and Expenses -** 

On my trip of 17 days I spent around US$2000 in total including flights, visas, accomodation, food, transportation, and even shopping. 

I am not a budget traveller and neither a luxury one. I like to travel comfortably and spend when it gives me a bit more comfort or saves me time. I would consider myself a mid-range traveller. 

I only occasionally travelled using public transport on this trip mainly because the taxis were soo affordable and luxurious at the same time. I also ate mostly at fine dining restaurants because of my dietry restrictions and those were the only places I could get stuff customised at according to me. I like coffee quite a bit and I had almost 2 coffees daily (mostly from Luckin Coffee - Highly Recommended!!). I stayed at comfortable hotels I would not say those were the cheapest options but they were the most value for money for my liking. I booked a 5 star hotel in Yangshuo because it had spectacular views and at the same time was not very expensive ( around $200 for 2 nights for 2 adults ). I also did decent a bit of shopping, things are relatively cheap/value for money here so it never felt like I was spending more than I need to. 

I think now you can get a rough estimate for budget based on your own travel style.

  
**Miscellaneous tips and itinerary details -**

* Try to book 1st class tickets on trains if you prefer a quieter cabin, everyone books the 2nd class tickets so you might find it a bit more crowded and there will be random chinese grandpas sneaking a smoke here and there. 
* Rent a e-scooter if you go to Yangshuo, they are super cute(image 4) and fun to drive around and in my opinion the best way to take in the views of the majestic Karst mountains
* Luckin coffee is genuinely really good and you will find their stores literally everywhere. Best stop for your coffee or iced tea needs
* Everything closes even in big cities at around 6-7PM so plan your meals accordingly, we had quite a few nights when we got late and could not find any restaurant open. What you can do in such situations is ask your hotel to help you order something from their food ordering app and you can pay them. Food deliveries are open until past midnight. 
* Language is something that you might find problematic as most people do not speak or understand english. Always keep a translate app on your phone. 
* Your phone is everything, keep a power bank with you or if you are about to run out of juice, rent a power bank from kiosks (they are everywhere, literally)
* Bidets are not common to find even in hotels, so if you are not used to using toilet paper make sure you carry a portable bidet with you. Thank me later ;)
* Keep at least 2-3 nights for Zhangjiajie, there is a lot to see here and anything less than that will just not be enough.
* For Chongqing I recommend atleast 2 nights and ideally 4, there is so much culture and mind bending city stuff to explore in this city. Also, the shopping scene in Chongqing is lit.
* For Yangshuo and Guilin I recommend keeping minimum 2 nights and ideally 3 to explore the region properly. 
* Do not carry power banks without a CCC certification with you on omestic flights in china, they will make you throw it away at security. 
* The trains are super convenient and comfortable, best way to travel within the country. 

  
**Visa-**

I used [Atlys.com](http://Atlys.com) for my Chinese visa as an Indian citizen. I applied for my visa on 26 August and they picked up my passport within a few days, I was contacted by them a few times to get updated documents from my side and then my visa was submitted to the embassy in Delhi. I was notified that my visa is approved (with a scanned copy of it on their app) on 6 September and I received my passport back on 9 September. I got a single entry visa and 30 days stay with a validity of 3 months. This was a business visa as I applied using my invitation letter from Canton Fair. I did not need to visit the embassy or give any special documents. Just a cover letter, bank statements and the usual documents (ID, work etc.)

I had a very smooth experience with Atlys and their team kept me updated about my application status even, like when they submitted my passport I got the submission slip sent to me(photo) for proof. 

I honestly was skeptical about them before deciding to go with them because of all the mixed reviews about them online, some people say they had the worst experience with them which honestly scared me a bit. But due to some work commitments, I was not able to travel myself to the embassy and apply for the visa myself which I always prefer to do; and Atlys offered a very attractive offer which was all of my documents will be picked up and delivered to me at home which is why I decided to give them a try. 

I had my fingers crossed and was hoping for the best, they just had a simple and easy process and their app is really good. I only felt relieved once I had my passport back in my hands. And overall I had a very good experience with them. I would reccomend them, it might sound controversial but this is just what I experienced. You are free to do your research and choose your best option. 

  
**Verdict-**

I really loved China as a country, they have a very rich culture, it is clean, very safe, people are good and it is a really budget friendly place. My mind was blown with all of the technology they have, weather it is their apps, cars, trains, robots for room service and more. I felt mesmerised by the things and the sheer scale of things at almost every place I went to. They are genuinely living in the future. The infrastructure they have even in the remote areas is something to take inspiration from. 

And China is not just about man-made marvels, they also have breathtaking nature, some of the best that I have seen so far. Yangshuo and Guilin were the cutest and most unique landscapes I've ever seen. The mountains in Zhangjiajie are unimaginable and make you question the scale of humans. 

If you are up for a truly unique and mind blowing travel experience you should visit China! I just saw a small part of this massive country but it was more than enough to convince me to come back and explore even more. There are several things still remaining on my list and I am sure they would be just as good if not better. 

I think China as a travel destination is very underrated and is also very afforable compared to options like South Korea and Japan. China also has something for everyone no matter what your travel style is. Weather you love cities, shopping, nature, adventure or road trips, there is a lot of stuff for everyone here. And it is super convenient and safe. 

Thanks for reading.

PS- You will hardly see any foreign tourists anywhere, more than 90% of the tourists and people you will see would be locals. 

PPS- Feel free to comment about any questions, or suggestions you might want like the hotels I stayed at or anything else, I am happy to answer and help out.

I am officiating a friend's wedding in the U.S. soon, and I came up with a last-minute idea to translate my ceremony script for the bride's mother, who may not understand. Their wedding is very nerdy and themed, so I got a bit word-y, and I would hate for her mama to not understand the fun of it. It is my first wedding ever, so please don't judge lol...

  
I would be so grateful, and so so happy to tip!

  
(fake names in bold for safety)

  
""Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today because of JOSIE, and JIM... and me! Just trying to make you all laugh. I’m LOLA. I’m the friend who brought JOSIE and JIM together. But that’s an embarrassing story for whoever wants to hear it later after cocktail hour. We have a much better story to talk about right now.



I mean, who could resist the fun of a wedding ceremony between a guy who loves the role playing game, Dungeons and Dragons, and a girl who spends much of her time collecting romantic books about fairytale creatures? Certainly from the invitations and decor at least, you’ve all noticed how detail oriented and bookish they both are. My initial plan was to run this whole thing like one big Dungeon Master script, but my husband told me I’m not allowed to do that, so. 



It really is so special that, among their several other shared hobbies, JOSIE and JIM share *this* interest in fantastical stories. So for the next few minutes, we are going to focus on that.



I don’t think JIM and JOSIE’s love story is too far off from the fairytales and folklore they cherish so much…



During their adventures together, JOSIE and JIM have travelled to many far off places. Envision them with me. Majestic snowy mountains, freezing cold with the aurora dancing overhead. Lively cities of light, music flowing out of doorways, delicious food beckoning, and stars dusting the sky. Sandy beaches, rocky cliffs, wonders of the world. Rowdy pubs, where they gather with friends and slam back pints of mead. Quiet bookshops, where they are comforted by the smell of old pages and the warmth of a good cup of coffee. Where they might buy a new book. In which, we meet the strong, attractive warlock who finds a soft spot for the beautiful, scrappy fae princess and together they save the entire kingdom.



In these stories, they are captivated by the magic, and the battles, and the dramatic crescendo of the lovers coming together.



But everyone knows that in real life, love stories don’t always work that way. In real-life-marriage, duels and battles are fought with cutting words instead of sharp swords. Kingdoms are lost over simple disagreements, not dragons. And alignments are made because work is so much more tolerable when you get to debrief with friends in the cafeteria.



It isn’t too much of a stretch of reality, though, to encourage JIM and JOSIE to *try* to treat their love like the epic romances they enjoy. To always remember to be intensely passionate with one another. To spring for magic moments with grand or small gestures. To not rush to the end, and instead, take their time in each chapter of life. To feel welcomed lean on all of us, their steadfast army of supporters from near and far. To always trust each other as a united front, because any couple knows, sometimes, when the going gets rough, it really can feel like it is you two against the world.



So yes, real life *is* different than fantasy. But that doesn’t mean JIM and JOSIE can’t strive for that same kind of heroism and that same kind of boundless love for all of their days. And I’m sure I speak for everyone here in wishing them the most epic of love stories.""

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I left a lot of info out, most importantly we were “exclusive” for the last few weeks since we met again and she had been more into than usual, relationship tiktoks, date ideas, constant phoning etc. 

Last weekend we were meant to meet again, but i had to cancel as i was ill. She said she was gutted but I said i’m down in her city this weekend anyway to see my friend, I could see you whenever i’m down? She said her friends are maybe staying so isn’t sure. All week very quiet, no chat at all just snaps, no tiktoks nothing. I get down on the Friday, ask if she’s out - she is but isn’t sure where she’s going. Don’t hear from her much and don’t see her so on the Saturday i’m asking how her night was etc. Back and forth convo until i ask if she wants to meet for a coffee later today - 30 mins no reply, online, eventually “i’ll let you know later”. She talks casually throughout the day, breadcrumbs about her day and occasional flirt. Then after 10pm, no reply until 11am the next day. Her location goes off too. 

I delete what I sent and i’m extremely blunt in the morning, she sent a ? and replied to some stories. She then phones 3 times. My dumbass friend seen her friend who stays in my city (small world) and said we were in a relationship, so i have to apologise and clear this up that i never said this. I tell her i’ll phone when im home, she just sends a 👍 lol. I speak to her for 5 mins on phone, clear it up - she says not a big deal that’s okay, is fine on the phone asking about my trip. I ask if we can talk later about the weekend, she says sure i’ll phone when im free.

An hour later i get a text that she was going to phone but doesn’t think this is gonna work out.. uni getting busy and distance is becoming more of a clearer issue now. I say is what it is, tbh after being ignored at the weekend i was pissed anyway but call out her bs reasons as i was literally in her city and she avoided me. She said she didn’t she was just busy, then goes onto say it isn’t anything to do with me it’s just her. She isn’t ready for a relationship, her anxiety is really bad, she needs to focus on herself. Sorry if it seems sudden she’s been thinking about it for a while, but has said this now to avoid leading me on…

So I’ll be heading to the gym to attempt double my PR bench later. Probably a weird post on this sub idk but thought was worth an update. Glad i’ll get to start flirting with my friends again though.",7,1763397525.0,moreplatesmoredates,2,1.0,False

1. Walking in the early morning. A long walk in the morning sets my day. It oxygenates my body. It gives my brain time to think without technological input. I don’t listen to anything, no music, no podcasts. Just the sound of the wind, the water, the trees and the birds. I hardly ever take a day off because I truly love it. I wake up, have some tea and get dressed while I am drinking it and still half asleep. I’m out the door within half an hour of waking up.

2. Oatmeal. Sounds dumb but goddammit I adore my oatmeal after my walk. With nuts and berries, a teense of maple syrup, a teaspoon of crunch peanut butter yum. Divine with a cup of coffee. It is nourishing and keeps me full until the afternoon.

3. 30 minute workout with various YouTube vids, with dumbbells or kettlebell. It takes a bit more discipline to get this done first thing but I love the feeling of tightening up. At my age it is not an easy feat to build muscle. I take 1 or 2 days off a week because again as we age recovery time to build muscle is essential.

4. Clean for 30 minutes every day. Finally our place is starting to look like I always imagined it. 

5. Accept invitations from friends whether or not they are sober. At this point I am fine with being around alcohol. I want to love life fully and not in an echo chamber of former alcoholics. I love my old friends. A lot of them drink heavily or are alcoholics. I still love them and want to see them from time to time.

6. I go out alone a lot to events, plays, concerts, shopping. I have always enjoyed stepping out alone and still do. My husband isn’t as social, that’s ok with me.

7. Skin care. I am meticulous about skin care morning and night. I recently started a gua sha routine and I can see the difference.

8. Go exploring. Sometimes I go to neighborhoods I never go to just to check things out if I am super bored. 

9. Learn something new. I like to read, and most recently I am researching Canada geese (we call them cobra chickens) because
 I find it fascinating that they just know how to communicate and fly in formation.

9. Work. I love my work.

1ozl0om,https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/1ozl0om/trip_recap_and_thanks_san_diego/,"Trip Recap and Thanks, San Diego","I do overly long posts, so apologies in advance. I had recently put up one of those annoying, ""I'm a tourist, where should I go!?!?"" posts (paraphrased) on here. I was coming into town on short notice and wanted a couple neighborhoods with **quirky and independent businesses (emphasis on LGBTQIA+, minority-, women-owned) I could browse and support since I had a LOAD of free time but no car**.

North Park and Hillcrest got the most love, so besides downtown (where my wife's conference was), that's where I focused.

Before the recap, an observation -- you people must be absolutely hopped up on coffee 24/7/365. I've traveled pretty extensively around the U.S. and I've never seen so many independent coffee places in my life. Every single block has a distinctive coffee place...I love that.

So, between Thursday morning and my mid-afternoon flight on Sunday, I walked 41 miles. My wife's conference was by Seaport Village downtown. My first day, I took the city bus up to North Park. (For the benefit of future visitors -- city transit was very easy to use and felt safe/clean for what it's worth. Use the **PRONTO** app...simple. Besides walking, this was how I got around). 

In sort-of chronological order....

**Nomad Donuts**. Interesting flavor options, decent donuts. I wouldn't go out of my way for them

**Saigon Coffee**.  I'm no stranger to Vietnamese coffee, but holy shit, the Hanoi Egg Coffee was top-notch. 10 out of 10. Good vibes there too (except a guy having a mental health crisis screaming in my face for a bit).

**Verbatim Books**. Visually stunning book shop. Good browse and I loved the super-eclectic decor. Definitely would recommend.

**MJ Cycles**. Just a quick browse. I'm a cyclist and this seemed like a great bike shop and I was happy to see a couple Cedaero (MN company) products. 

I browsed around a few other places but due to my stupid brain forgetting the time zone difference, I was there before a lot of places opened. 

I decided to walk University Ave from North Park to Hillcrest. 

Along the way, I stumbled into **Footnote Books**. At a glance, the place looks like a hoarder runs it. It's tiny and PACKED with books. The thing is, it's pretty meticulously curated and organized. The owner was great and he had super insights on thrifting/shops, swap meets, etc. I was really happy to support Footnote! Among my favorite bookstores I've been to this year (including Palo Alto, San Francisco, and Boston recently).

I popped into a couple thrift shops (**Father Joe's** and **Goodwill** were decent) and a few other places on my walk.

Around Hillcrest, I went into **Bluestocking Books**. Loved the vibe and a nice shop. I window-shopped a lot of other places, but was getting hungry. I ended up having a couple tacos at **Roberto's Taco Shop**. It was ""OK"".

Broadly, Hillcrest felt welcoming and I wish I had spent more time there. I just scratched the surface, I think.

From there, I walked down the west edge of Balboa Park and into Bankers Hill. I was already pushing 10 miles of walking, so I decided to bus the last mile, then put my feet up at the hotel for a bit.

After my wife finished her conference, we hit **La Puerta** (4th Ave) for dinner. It was good...maybe 8/10-ish.

I’ve been dealing with horrible stomach episodes for years. I recently saw a gastro and had an upper endoscopy done. Everything came back normal: no H. pylori, no ulcers, just mild acid reflux. The next step is an ultrasound. I had one about 10 years ago for the exact same pain and they didn’t find anything then either (no gallstones). I’ve stumped my doctors. 

My symptoms:
	•	Severe pain in the upper abdomen, right in the center where my ribs meet
	•	Pain comes in waves
	•	Nausea and vomiting
	•	Chills
	•	this will last 5+ hours
Eventually the pain moves down to my lower abdomen
	•	Extreme bloating
	•	Can’t pass gas or have a bowel movement

The whole episode usually lasts around 48 hours and at the end of it - diarrhea.

I’ve noticed that mixing alcohol (IPA and wine) is a common denominator, but I’ve also had flare ups without alcohol, like after drinking coffee on an empty stomach, dairy and alcohol, or going too long without eating. Sometimes it can be completely random. 

A heating pad is the only thing that gives me any relief. Tums, antacids, Pepto don’t help at all.

Just wondering if anyone else has gone through something like this or found answers. Thanks in advance!

So I recently ordered an electric gooseneck kettle with a built-in thermometer (~€45) and a coffee scale with a timer (~€10) from a well-known Chinese marketplace. Honestly, I don’t really see the point in spending €150 on a branded kettle and €50+ on scales — I’d rather put that money toward a good grinder.

Speaking of which, I also grabbed a Kingrinder K6 from Amazon.

Now I just need to pick a dripper.
I’m set on a V60, but I’m not sure which material to go for — plastic, glass, ceramic, or metal. I’m also considering the V60 Switch instead of the regular V60, but again, I have no idea which version/material makes the most sense.

I’ve also come across sets that include a server and a measuring spoon, but I’m not convinced they’re actually worth it. The price doesn’t seem like much of a deal. Maybe it’s better to buy a server separately? If so, I’d appreciate any specific recommendations.

I already have a good water filter, but maybe I’m still missing something important? If there’s anything else you think I should add to my setup, feel free to let me know.

My problem is feeling MASSIVE guilt about spending money on races. The budget is really tight and I just am not finding that I have the same wiggle room as I did in 2021-22 with regards to dropping $100-$300 on a race fee and the associated costs for travel (I do race locally, but also in places where I need to spend the night because they are a few hours away). And the cost of gear/shoes/fuel/etc. adds up, too! I work full-time at a job I love that compensates me well and have a child, but still feel like things are tight.

I am not talking about racing every month, more like 5 ish times a year would be ideal...right now it feels like I can only reasonably afford \~2-3 races with an overnight stay per year, which is less than I would like to be able to do.



**Does anyone have any strategies regarding the following:**

\--Have you picked up an even small ""side hustle""/extra job to bring in a bit more $$$ and offset the race fees?

\--Are there intentional tradeoffs you have made that have helped (for example - no coffee out, meals out to prioritize budgeting for races...?)

\-- Are there manageable ways to get running shoes or gear for a cheaper-than-retail price? I look out for sales, but it's still a lot!

\--Do many races offer educator discounts? Is it worth asking that sort of question or insulting (I know race directors are not making huge profits)?

\--Are you someone who has set aside other habits to fit racing in your budget?

\--is there another strategy people use?

\--I know planning ahead also saves fees because they go up closer to the race, but with a kiddo, I am not able to plan super far ahead most of the time....

  
I am sure I cannot be the only one who loves to run and race but feels the impact financially. it is an enormous privilege to be able to race *at all,* and I recognize that too!

Long story short these days I sense  she sees us something more than freinds like she says stuff i don't understand if freinds says to each other and her intension are more than freindship idk if she is into girls but def I'm not I'm just tomboy athletic girl who happens to give bf treatment as nature.

I’m always up for good conversations, coffee, sports, or even a walk on the beach.

If you're around and want to grab some pizza or chai, I am up.

Love should not be one of them.,"Looking for something more than just small talk and surface-level connections, I seek depth and I seek substance. Something long term that ages like fine wine, not something short term that fizzles out like soda pop.

Seeking a genuine connection of mind, body and soul.

Someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together, A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

Be it to grab a cozy coffee, chat the day away or maybe watch a movie.

No tricks, only treats - just two humans trying to make the most of this time before the Mariah Carey Christmas takeover begins.

1ozkog9,https://i.redd.it/2mz0gn5gfu1g1.png,What’s It Really Like Living in Sunterra? (Katy TX – 2026 Edition),"Hey everyone — I’ve lived in the Katy area since 2003, and I’ve watched a lot of neighborhoods pop up and evolve over the years. One of the newest communities that people keep asking about is Sunterra, especially because of the huge Crystal Lagoon® that’s been getting so much attention.

If you haven’t seen it yet, Sunterra has this interesting mix of modern homes, lakes, trails, and a resort-style feel that’s pretty different from most Katy neighborhoods. It’s definitely one of the more “up-and-coming” spots on the north side of town.

Here are a few things that stood out to me:

🌊 **The lagoon is real — and it’s big.**  
It gives the neighborhood a beachy, vacation vibe you don’t usually see in the area.

🏠 **Builders are everywhere.**  
Perry, Highland, Chesmar, Lennar, Westin, D.R. Horton… lots of different styles and price points.

🌳 **Outdoor lifestyle is huge here.**  
Parks, lakes, trails, and events all over the community.

☕ **Close to a ton of Katy favorites.**  
Katy Mills, the Boardwalk, No Label Brewing, Kona Coffee, Harvest on Mason, etc.

I’m curious —  
**Does anyone here live in Sunterra?**  
What’s your favorite part of the neighborhood so far?

Or if you’ve toured it recently…  
**What surprised you the most?**

Would love to hear some real experiences or thoughts from people who’ve checked it out.",1,1763396633.0,KatyTXLifeAndLocal,0,1.0,False

1ozknk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SennoGroup/comments/1ozknk7/are_you_seeking_after_truth_of_life/,are you seeking after truth of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1ozklqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1ozklqq/clarifications_on_24hrs_abpm/,Clarifications on 24hrs ABPM?,"Hi! I really appreciate this sub reddit existing. I'm a 28yrs old Spaniard man and had some form of at least tendency towards hyperthension since early 20s.. despite me eating well being lean in great shape etc. also did bp/urine tests (for hormones and stuff like adrenaline etc.) and renal artery tests and it all came out OK.

I recently did a 24hrs ABPM but had some questions/concerns about it and was hoping to get some clarifications on how to interpret it, would *really really* appreciate it. (I did go to a cardiologist but I did not wanna bother him with too many questions as I am a bit shy and anxious..):

* The total average is 137/70 (139/74 day and 129/53 night). Which doesn't seem too concerning I guess (?); but, there are random spikes (no particular activity, besides maybe cooking) with SYS at 180 and DIA at times also at 110 or 120. Are these cause of concern?
* Is it true that with these readings I should avoid heavy lifting in the gym/be wary about doing intense sport in general? Or drink coffee lol? Cause if it's at 160 SYS baseline and I do that it goes even higher? Idk
* Most often the SYS is elevated but the DIA is ok. Is this contrast/difference more reassuring or an even more cause of potential concern?
* My total heart rate average is 54 (56 day, 46 night). I am healthy but by no means an athlete. Is this too low? And too low for a mild beta blocker or should I not worry about that (doc was considering prescribing it)?

Thank you so much in advance. I can attach an image of the ABPM here below for reference.. (BTW, the day/night timelines are wrong. In reality I fell asleep at 1AM and woke up at 9AM)

1ozklk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ozklk1/book_rebels_pirates_and_tentacles_the_story_of/,"Book: Rebels, Pirates and Tentacles: The Story of LucasArts","Hi, everyone!

Some of you may know me. I’m a video game history researcher and the author of several books, including Through the Moongate: The Story of Richard Garriott, Origin Systems Inc. and Ultima and The Sumerian Game: A Digital Resurrection.

I’ve been working for a long time on a book about LucasArts titled Rebels, Pirates and Tentacles: The Story of LucasArts, which is now close to publication via a [Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1108065491/video-games-stage-3-the-story-of-lucasarts?ref=1pwor9).

The book covers the company’s history—from its origins up to 1990—with particular attention to the people who worked there, the creative side of game design, and the technological side, without leaving out any game. In short: it’s not just about the graphic adventures, but about the entirety of LucasArts’ output.

The book is based on meticulous research and numerous original interviews. It’s not a coffee table book, nor a collection of reviews, trivia, or solutions: it’s a history book—detailed, accurate, and packed with information about the company, what was happening in the video game industry during those years, and the influence LucasArts had on the market.

Amiga was the third preferred hardware of LucasArts (after Atari 800 and Commodore 64 and before the PC) so I hope you'll find this book very interesting :)

[https://www.andreacontato.com/rebels--pirates-and-tentacles---preview-eng](https://www.andreacontato.com/rebels--pirates-and-tentacles---preview-eng)

I also released a full preview chapter (the formation of the initial team) so everyone can get a sense of how the book is structured and my research and writing style. If you have any questions, I’m at your disposal :) The Kickstarter launched three week and is going pretty well. We reached the goal in 3 hours and 3 stretch goals :)
