this happened last night but I need to get it out somewhere anonymous.

My husband and I have been married for six years. I’ve never thought of him as violent. Stubborn, yes. Dismissive sometimes but never someone who would hurt me.

The argument started earlier that night, and I’ll admit i was the jealous one.

m He’s been talking about a coworker lately. Not constantly, but enough that I noticed. Her name comes up in stories about work, jokes she made, how good she is at what she does. i finally snapped and asked him if he liked her more than he should.

He laughed at first... laugh the one that makes you feel stupid for even asking.

I didn’t drop it. I told him it felt weird. That I felt pushed aside. That lately, he seemed more patient with her than with me.That’s when his tone changed and told ne I was being insecure. That I was imagining things. That I was tired and reading too much into nothing.

We stopped talking after that. Not resolved just quiet.

we went to bed together , he didn't even bothered brushing his teeth btw.  lights off.  I was on my phone, still angry, replaying the conversation and wondering if I’d overreacted or if my gut was trying to tell me something.

then it happened.i felt a sting on my cheek. a sudden, sharp slap.i gasped and turned to him completely stunned before I could even speak, he said that there was a mosquito

He showed ne his paln. And yes there was one. Dead.

But my cheek was burning, and my hands were shaking. The slap was hard. Not a gentle swat. Not a reflex that missed its target.

so I slapped him back and hard and he looked at me shocked.

i told him he  didn’t have to hit me.

He immediately apologized. Said he didn’t mean it like that. Said it was just instinct. Said he’d never hurt me but he was also angry that i slapped him back But all I could think about was the timing.

Minutes earlier, I had accused him of something that made him angry, I had challenged him. And then suddenly, his hand landed on my face, with a mosquito as the explanation.

He slept on the couch last night. I didn’t tell him to go. I just rolled over and stared at the wall, wondering why my chest felt so tight and i seldom cry but i did tonight.

today I acted normal. I made coffee. I asked about his work schedule. I even asked how his coworker was doing and hated myself for it.

What scares me isn’t just the slap. It’s how easily it blended into the argument.. How quickly it was explained away. How part of me wonders if I deserved it for pushing too hard.

I don’t know if this was a one-time mistake or a glimpse of something I don’t want to see yet.

So Reddit… how do you tell the difference between an accident and anger that finally slipped through?

everytime i look at my husband my hearts is in pain. 

i dont know where to go from here. am i overreacting or justa a plain asshole?",1,1766302686.0,AITAH,11,0.6,False

We ordered a coffee and while having the coffee we were also working. First thing, while ordering the cafe, the manager gave us a weird look asking “only one coffee? That’s it!?” That was weird!

We sat there ONLY for 30 Minutes and the waiter came to us and asked us to leave saying it's not a working cafe? What we do while drinking or having food is not there concern since we WERE not using their wifi or causing any disturbance.
When we went to the manager to complain about this he was so rude. Such people should not be made managers who don't know how to speak with customers. Rather than taking the feedback or being apologetic he went on a rant defending the waiter’s actions.

They have some stupid rule of not sitting idle for more than 45 minutes, but that's the crazy thing. We ordered coffee and it only had been 30 minutes. Had we been sitting for more than 45 minutes not ordering anything, they could have told us to leave. But that wasn't the case.

We are working professionals and have worked in literally all the cafes of tricity. We understand and respect each place's rules.
But this is totally unacceptable!
Horrible experience, horrible place

1ps0tw1,https://youtu.be/2etYk6MKEOM,4 Very Scary TRUE Long Haul Truck After Midnight Horror Stories,"# ""Quiet Games"":

I still remember stopping at that quiet truck stop off the highway in Oregon—the kind that glows too bright against the dark, all neon and buzzing lights, but feels strangely hollow after sunset. My car had finally died earlier that day, coughing out one last breath of steam before giving up for good. I’d walked the final mile on sore legs, clutching the hope that I could find a phone or someone willing to help.

Inside the cramped store, I bought a cup of hot chocolate, wrapping my hands around it for warmth while counting the last of my money. That was when he walked in.

He was tall—huge, really—the kind of man who seemed to fill whatever space he stood in, like a wall that had learned how to move. He smiled easily as he ordered coffee, then glanced over at me, alone by the counter.

“You look like you could use a friend,” he said. His voice was low and calm, almost comforting. “Car trouble?”

I nodded, taking a small sip. “Yeah. It broke down. I’m trying to get to the city.”

He paid for his coffee, then slid his card again, covering mine without asking. “I’m headed that way anyway. Name’s Jack. I drive trucks. Hop in, I’ll make sure you get there safe.”

I hesitated. Every warning I’d ever heard flickered through my head, but out there, stranded and exhausted, my options felt thin. He didn’t seem strange—just another guy on the road, doing a decent thing.

“Okay,” I said finally. “Thank you. I’m Anna.”

The cab of his truck sat high above the ground, cluttered with folded maps, empty cups, and the stale smell of old food and dust. When the engine roared to life, the vibration hummed through my bones as we eased back onto the highway.

At first, everything felt normal. We talked about nothing important. He told me stories about driving coast to coast, about deserts that never seemed to end and mountain passes that stole your breath.

“It’s freedom,” he said. “Just you and the road. No one watching over your shoulder.”

I told him I’d quit my job, that I wanted something different—something bigger than the life I’d been stuck in. He chuckled quietly.

“Adventure can turn on you fast,” he said. “Gotta be careful who you trust.”

The words lingered, but I let them slide. Outside, the highway was empty, our headlights carving tunnels through the dark. After a while, he turned the music down.

“You ever feel small out here?” he asked. “Like if you disappeared, no one would even notice?”

A chill crawled up my spine. “People notice eventually,” I said.

He looked over at me, eyes steady on my face. “Not always. Some people don’t have roots. Makes them easy to lose.”

The silence that followed felt heavier than before. When he pulled into a deserted roadside turnout, he said he needed to stretch his legs.

“Come on,” he said. “Fresh air.”

I stepped out, my legs stiff, the cold biting through my clothes. The trees pressed in close, their shadows thick and watchful. No other cars. No lights.

He leaned against the truck and lit a cigarette, studying me through the smoke. “You know, Anna,” he said, “you’re pretty. Remind me of someone I met once.”

“Thanks,” I muttered, taking a step back.

He crushed the cigarette under his boot. “She talked too much, though. Started to get on my nerves.”

Before I could react, his hand snapped around my wrist, crushing tight. “Don’t scream,” he said calmly. “We’re just playing now.”

I struggled, panic slamming into me. “Let go! What are you doing?”

He shoved me against the cold metal of the truck, his weight pinning me there. “Quiet games,” he said. “I like seeing how long people last.”

Adrenaline took over. I drove my heel into his knee as hard as I could. He grunted, his grip faltering just enough. I tore free and ran, branches tearing at my skin as I plunged into the trees.

Behind me, his footsteps thundered. “Come back!” he shouted. “You can’t win!”

I ducked behind a thick trunk, barely daring to breathe. His voice shifted, almost playful, echoing through the woods.

“I always find them,” he called. “Leave a little smile when I’m done. Helps me remember.”

My stomach twisted. He moved closer, a flashlight beam slicing through the dark.

“The last one begged,” he said calmly. “Said she had family. Didn’t change anything.”

I stayed frozen, heart pounding so loud I was sure he could hear it. Minutes crawled by. Eventually, his voice drifted farther away. Then the truck engine started. Gravel crunched. The sound faded down the road.

I waited a long time before I moved. When I finally reached the highway, shaking and scraped raw, a van slowed and stopped. The driver took one look at me and drove me straight to the police.

At first, they listened with careful doubt. But my description fit others—too well. A massive trucker. A friendly smile. Girls picked up and never seen again.

They caught him weeks later, piecing it together from logs, sightings, and the people who’d gotten away.

I was one of the lucky ones.





# ""Chained"":

I ran out of money at a lonely truck stop in Utah, the kind that feels forgotten by the rest of the world. My car had finally died a few miles back—smoke pouring from under the hood like it was giving up its last breath—and I’d been walking along the shoulder ever since, thumb out, hoping someone would stop. Night was creeping in, the desert cooling fast, and I was starting to wonder if I’d made a terrible mistake coming this way alone.

That’s when a large truck slowed and pulled over. The driver leaned out and waved me closer. He looked worn down by the road—dark circles under his eyes, stubble along his jaw—but he smiled easily. Too easily. When he smiled, I noticed his teeth: narrow, sharp-looking, catching the light in a strange way.

“Hop in,” he said. “I’ll get you where you’re headed.”

His voice was calm and steady, the kind that made you want to believe him. I hesitated for half a second, then climbed up into the cab, grateful just to be moving again. I thanked him, shut the door, and told myself I was lucky. I had no idea that decision would follow me for the rest of my life.

We drove for a while, the truck eating up the miles. He talked about the road, about how he’d been driving these routes for years.  
“Name’s Tim,” he said casually. “Gets lonely out here.”

I told him a little about myself—how I was heading west, how I needed a fresh start. At first, I felt relieved. Safe, even. The hum of the engine was steady, almost soothing. But then he eased off the highway and turned onto a darker, narrower road that stretched into nothing.

“Shortcut,” he said when I asked.

Something twisted in my gut. The air felt different, heavier. I told myself I was being paranoid. I didn’t want to seem ungrateful.

Eventually, he pulled over in the middle of nowhere. Just dirt, scrub, and silence.  
“Gotta check something in the back,” he said, climbing out.

I stayed in the passenger seat, staring at my phone. No signal. Of course. A few seconds later, my door flew open. Before I could even process what was happening, his hand clamped around my wrist, crushing hard enough to make me gasp.

“You’re coming with me,” he said, his voice suddenly cold.

“What are you doing? Let go!” I yelled, trying to wrench free, but he was stronger. He dragged me toward the sleeper compartment behind the cab and shoved me past a thick curtain. Inside, it was dark and cramped. A narrow bed. Bare metal walls. Rings bolted into the frame.

My heart pounded so hard I thought it might burst.

He forced me down and snapped a chain around my ankle, locking it tight.  
“This is your home now,” he murmured, leaning close. I saw his teeth again—really saw them this time. Filed down. Pointed. Wrong.

“Why?” I whispered, my whole body shaking.

He laughed softly. “I like company. And you… you fit.”

Then he disappeared back into the driver’s seat. The truck lurched forward, and I pulled at the chain until my skin burned. It didn’t budge. Somewhere along that empty road, the truth settled in: no one knew where I was. No one was coming.

Time blurred. Hours melted into days. He drove constantly, stopping only in isolated places. When he came back, he brought scraps—stale sandwiches, warm water—and sat there watching me eat, watching me breathe.

“Tell me stories,” he’d say. “Keep me entertained.”

So I talked. About anything. Everything. I told him memories, lies, half-made dreams—whatever I thought might keep him calm. But his eyes never softened. They were empty, like nothing inside them cared whether I lived or died.

One day, he held up a small metal file.  
“See this?” he said lightly. “It fixes things.”

Before I could move, he grabbed my chin. The sound of metal scraping against my teeth sent pain shooting through my skull. I screamed and begged him to stop, tears streaming down my face, but he didn’t. When he finally pulled away, my mouth throbbed, my teeth ruined.

“Now we match,” he said, smiling.

I begged him every day after that. Promised him anything.  
“I won’t tell anyone. Please. Just let me go.”

He always shook his head. “The road keeps secrets,” he’d say. “And you’re mine.”

At night, when the truck stopped, he chained me tighter. Afterwards, I’d curl into myself, staring into the dark, trying to disappear. Fear hollowed me out. The worst thought wasn’t even dying—it was surviving like this forever.

Weeks later—at least, I think it was weeks—he pulled into a weigh station.  
“Don’t make a sound,” he warned, locking the curtain.

I heard voices outside. Officials. My heart hammered. I looked down at the chain around my ankle. One link was thinner than the others, bent and worn from all my struggling. My hands shook as I twisted it, pain shooting through my leg. I didn’t stop. I couldn’t.

The link snapped.

I slipped out through the opposite door while he was distracted and ran. My legs barely worked, but I ran anyway.  
“Help me!” I screamed at the first uniformed worker I saw. “Please—he’s holding me!”

Everything exploded into motion after that. Shouting. Radios. Police. They surrounded the truck and dragged him out. He looked at me once, that same sharp-toothed smile still on his face, before they cuffed him and shoved him into a car.

At the station, I told them everything—the chains, the tools, the endless miles.  
“He said I belonged to him,” I whispered.

They listened. They believed me. They found exactly what I described hidden in his truck. Later, they told me he’d done this before. I wasn’t the first.

In court, he was sentenced to years behind bars.

It didn’t erase what happened. But it ended his road. And for the first time in a long time, I knew I was free.





# ""The Clearing"":

I left the house after a bad argument with my husband, my head buzzing and my chest tight. I just needed space—somewhere to breathe. Our baby boy was asleep against me, only a few months old, his tiny weight warm and familiar in my arms. I walked to the nearby shopping center, drawn by the glow of the lights. They made the night feel safer, less lonely. I sat on a bench and rocked him gently, breathing in the cool air, hoping it would settle my thoughts.

A car rolled up slowly and stopped nearby. A tall man stepped out, moving casually, like he belonged there. He smiled in a way that seemed kind and said, “Looks like you could use some company.” His voice was calm and soft, the sort that makes you think someone understands hard nights. He introduced himself as Keith and started talking about his own children, how much he missed them since his wife had left. The details sounded sincere. I felt seen, less alone than I had minutes earlier.

“Do you want to sit in the car and talk?” he asked. It didn’t feel dangerous—just conversation, I told myself. I nodded and climbed in, keeping my baby on my lap.

At first, we just drove around town. We talked about families, about how complicated life could be. “Family is everything,” he said, his hands steady on the steering wheel. Then, without warning, he turned off onto a narrow road that led away from the houses, away from the streetlights. Trees closed in on both sides.

“Where are we going?” I asked. My voice wavered despite my effort to sound calm.

“Just somewhere quiet,” he said. His tone was different now—flat, distant.

He stopped in a clearing surrounded by woods and shut off the engine. The sudden silence pressed in. When he turned to face me, his expression had changed completely. The warmth was gone. His eyes were hard.

“Come closer,” he said, reaching toward me.

I pulled back instinctively, tightening my hold on my son. “No. I want to go home.”

His hand clamped around my arm, painfully strong. “You’re not going anywhere,” he whispered, so close I could feel his breath.

Panic flooded me as he shoved me down, trying to force himself on me. I fought as hard as I could—kicking, twisting, desperate—but he was much bigger. His hands slid to my neck and tightened. I struggled for air. In the chaos, my baby slipped from my arms and fell onto the floor, crying loudly.

“Please,” I gasped. “My son—please, stop.”

For a moment, he hesitated, glancing down at the baby. Then his grip tightened again. “Quiet,” he growled.

Time lost all meaning after that. I begged him over and over, telling him not to hurt us, reminding him of the children he claimed to love. He spoke calmly, almost casually, saying things like, “No one will ever find you out here.” That calmness terrified me more than shouting ever could. I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone if he let us go. The baby’s cries never stopped, filling the car, sharp and desperate.

Eventually—after what felt like hours—something shifted. He leaned back, started the engine, and muttered, “Fine. But you don’t say a word.”

The drive back felt endless. Every bump in the road made me flinch. I held my baby tightly, whispering to him, trying to soothe us both. When we reached town, he stopped near where he’d picked me up.

“Remember,” he said, his eyes cold. “Not a word.”

I nodded, opened the door, and ran. I didn’t stop until I reached the police station just down the block.

The officers took my statement and asked questions. “He said his name was Keith,” I told them, describing the car as best I could. They found him quickly and brought him in. He admitted to some of it, was charged with a minor offense, paid a fine, and left town.

I thought that was the end.

Later, I learned it wasn’t. He went on to hurt other women—some of them losing their lives—along the highways he traveled as a truck driver.

That night never left me. Sleep became difficult. I checked the locks twice. I held my children closer. What haunted me most wasn’t just what he did—it was how easily he changed. How quickly kindness turned into cruelty, like flipping a switch.





# ""Silver Stripes"":

I used to work the night shift at a big truck stop just off Interstate 80, pouring coffee and flipping burgers for drivers rolling through half-awake and road-weary. Most of them were harmless—polite, grateful for a hot plate and a few minutes of conversation before disappearing back into the dark. You learn their rhythms after a while. But one night, someone walked in who changed the way I see the road forever.

He was huge. Not just tall, but broad, the kind of man who seemed to fill the room without trying. A thick beard covered most of his face, and his eyes stayed cold even when his mouth pulled into something that was supposed to be a smile. He slid onto a stool at the counter and ordered eggs and toast.

“Long drive ahead,” he said, his voice low and unhurried.

I poured his coffee and made small talk, asking where he was headed.  
“East,” he said, then paused. “Then south.” He watched me over the rim of his mug. “You ever get lonely working nights like this?”

I laughed lightly, brushing it off. “Sometimes. But I don’t mind the quiet.”

He nodded and ate slowly, barely looking at his plate. Most of the time his attention stayed on me. When he finished, he left a generous tip and stood. “If you ever need a ride,” he said, “my truck’s the red one with the silver stripes.”

I thanked him out of habit, told him I had my own car. He smiled again, but it never reached his eyes.

Later that night, while I was wiping down tables, I saw him outside near the lot. He was talking to Lisa—a girl who drifted around the truck stop sometimes, picking up odd jobs or hitching rides. She was young, always hopeful, always broke. I watched her hesitate for just a second before climbing into his cab.

I didn’t think much of it. Drivers picked up riders all the time.

The next day, Lisa didn’t show up.

I asked around, but no one had seen her. I told myself she’d caught a ride somewhere far, found something better. That’s what people always said. But two days later, the radio in the diner went quiet as the news came on. A woman’s body had been found near a rest area not far from us. Strangled.

When they showed her picture on the small TV above the counter, my hands started shaking so badly I had to grip the edge of the sink. It looked just like Lisa.

A week later, he came back.

Same stool. Same order.  
“Missed your coffee,” he said, smiling that hollow smile.

I tried to keep my voice steady, but it came out thin. “Where’ve you been?”

“Around,” he said. “Picked up a friend last time. Nice company. For a while.” His eyes locked onto mine, heavy and knowing. “Road gets real empty without someone to talk to.”

I nodded and moved away, pretending to check on other customers. My skin felt cold, tight. Outside, through the window, I could see his truck—the red cab with silver stripes, its windows dark and unreadable.

When he finally left, I called the police tip line from the back room, my voice barely above a whisper. I told them what I’d seen. The truck. The timing. They thanked me and said they’d look into it.

Nothing happened.

Weeks went by. Another woman disappeared from a truck stop down the highway. Then another body was found. Same marks around the neck. I started locking my car the moment I stepped outside, even in the middle of the lot. Every pair of headlights made my stomach twist.

One night after my shift, my car wouldn’t start. Dead battery. The lot was nearly empty—just a few rigs idling, engines rumbling like distant thunder. I popped the hood and tried to jump it with cables from the diner, but the engine wouldn’t turn over.

Then I heard footsteps behind me.

“Need a hand?” he asked.

I turned, and there he was again, standing too close.  
“Yeah,” I said carefully. “It’s not starting.”

He leaned over the engine, his hands massive and rough. “Hop in my cab while I take a look,” he said. “It’s warmer.”

“I’m fine out here.”

His voice hardened. “Don’t be stubborn.”

Something in his eyes made me step back. He reached for my arm—light at first, then tighter. “Just for a minute.”

I yanked free. “No. I’ll call a friend.”

His expression changed completely, like a switch had been flipped. “Suit yourself.” But he didn’t move. He just stood there, watching.

I didn’t run—I walked fast, forcing myself to stay calm—but my heart was pounding as I went back inside. I locked the door and called my boss, who lived nearby. He showed up quickly with a tow truck.

By then, the red rig with silver stripes was gone.

I didn’t sleep that night. All I could think about was Lisa. About how close I’d come.

Months later, the police finally caught him. His name was Dellmus Colvin, a long-haul driver out of Ohio. In his truck, they found ropes. Women’s clothes. Bloodstains. He confessed to killing six women—maybe more—picking them up at truck stops just like ours. Strangling them in his cab while the engine idled, then dumping their bodies along the highway.

Some he met while dealing drugs. One woman argued about money. Another, he said, talked too much.

I testified at his trial. I told them about the nights he came in, the way he watched. “He offered rides,” I said from the stand. “But something felt wrong.”

He got life in prison.

Still, even now, when a big rig pulls into a quiet lot late at night, I feel it—that tightness in my chest. The road is long, and it keeps its secrets well.

I don’t work nights anymore. I took a day job at a small store in town. But I drive carefully. I check my mirrors. Because I know now—danger doesn’t always look dangerous.

I was having a different dream, when suddenly my dreamscape took on the appearance of a water-like view. It was like I had my eyes open under water, and I could see a screen. On the screen was my email inbox and in it I saw an email from a stalker I had, but had shook for for a few months and hadn't heard from. I remember seeing their name and the subject on the gmail view, and though it wasn't technically their email, the name was theirs and i knew it was them.

I woke up and forgot it, but then after having some coffee and before checking my online stuff, I was talking to my wife when i remembered the dream.

I laughed and said ""wouldn't it be wild if I checked and she emailed me?"" and my wife nods and says, ""you should check."" and I was like ""If I check it and she emailed me, I will...shit.""

I go over to my computer, completely expecting to be wrong, but there it was.

Her name, her email, and her trying to stir up shit again.

I ran away from my computer saying ""holy shit holy shit holy shit."" and my wife was like ""holy shit."" she witnessed it firsthand. 

the other two dreams had a similar thing happen where I saw the sign through a watery-like vision.

She had two chances to eat, but she did not eat at all. My brother and I obviously got upset about this... she's also been drinking a lot of coffee (I forget if it's a liver condition or not idk what but she got that literally from overworking herself back where we used to live and drinking a lot of Monsters). She has quit drinking a lot of Monsters and doesn't touch them anymore, but coffee can be just as bad probably, she's probably drinking like five a day. She kept telling me to just be quiet, and since I'm only 13, I don't know what I'm talking about, and since she is 44, she knows more..She said her doctor, who specializes in her condition, told her it's fine if she has 4-5 cups of black coffee (def a lie and I didn't even know she had to talk to her special condition until this and she has not been to a doctor in a while) My older brother and I were making valid points, I mean, no one was telling her that she had to work during her break at all, and she said she signed a contract stating they can tell her that she needs to work on her break if they are really short-staffed (they didn't tell her to do that, it's just a regular Sunday where they are a little short, and all she was doing on her break was just doing some papers. She could have snacked a little during that). Anyway, I'm not sure anymore, I'm really worried about her. I heard of people dying from exhaustion, and I don't know what to do. I told her about how worried I was, and she just keeps brushing it off and telling me to stop.

I’m not sure if it rises to the level of requesting a partial refund or not, so I wanted to bring it here to all you experts to get some options.

The “apartment” is very clearly a basement someone converted into a studio by themselves, not professionally. The electrical is suspect, half the outlets are painted over and not fully screwed into the wall, the shower needed to be re-grouted sometime in the last century, and the paint job is so haphazard it’s not funny.

But let’s look past all of that…sure it doesn’t look great but the bed’s comfy. It’s a place to stay. None of that in and of itself is enough to get my ire up. But here’s some of the things that DO make me wonder if we should escalate things.

I think the biggest complaint my partner and I have is the climate control or lack thereof. There is no way to control the heat vents in the unit. They are 100% controlled by whoever rents the house upstairs (also an AirBnB). Sure theres a fan and a radiant heater, but in a tiny basement with 7’ ceilings, thats no match for the central heating system and the whims of the renters above us. Host response: yep, it’s controlled upstairs but theres a small fan if you’re hot.

Other issues: The hood vent fan over the stove doesn’t work. In fact, there isn’t even a vent. The supplied coffee/tea mugs (all 2 of em) were dirty and stained as was the cabinet they were in. So is the fridge and freezer. When we went to clean up a little bit, turns out there is zero tissue paper or paper towels. When we reached out to ask the hosts all we got was “we don’t supply that”. The bathroom sink basin is chipped in several places and is rusted…clearly not recently. On arrival, the town had dealt with a massive snowstorm. Zero effort had been made to clear any sort of route to our entrance, and no shovel was available so we had to traipse our way with luggage and clear our own path in boots. Mind you we were a day late arriving so there was certainly time.

None of this to say anything of the extremely poor soundproofing that makes it sound like they’re in the room with us (host response: they leave tomorrow). Update: new guests arrived, footsteps damned near rattle the ceiling.

Maybe it’s just a ton of little things that have added up, or the host’s seeming indifference to just about anything, but I’m really struggling with the idea that we paid $140+ per night and literally can’t control the temperature in our poorly maintained basement of an apartment…does this seem unreasonable or am I just whining?",3,1766302130.0,AirBnB,2,1.0,False

I wanna be a bit more greedy and wish for a plot twist to end this year with, perhaps?

Puto bumbong dates over endless patient charts? Yes, please! Being a healthcare gurlie during the holiday season is such an extreme sport— I need someone who can be my escape and make me feel the festive season.

About me:

25-year-old gurlie currently living in QC. I’m plus-sized, with above normal BMI though I stand at 5’4”. I’ve already lost weight and been steadily shedding off pa. I’m not conventionally-attractive, but I am particular about hygiene and have been called cute a few times. 

I try to have a life outside my work: Kahit busy, I make time for my hobbies. I’m a huge reader (let’s trade book recs!) and I’m a sucker for anything cute. If it’s pink, fluffy, or a blind box, it’s coming home with me.

Low Maintenance: Since I spend most of my time on duty, I appreciate the little things, athoughtful text, a quick snack or coffee run, or just sitting in silence while we both do our own thing.

What I’m looking for:

Someone who is emotionally mature and has a life of their own. I love hearing about things I don't know (non-med topics are very welcome!). Since it’s December, let’s go on a low-pressure date. Pwedeng arcade, bookshop crawl, or just a quiet dinner where we can talk about everything and nothing.

The catch:

My memory is bad, and my sleep schedule is worse. If you can handle a med gurlie who smells like rubbing alcohol but has the heart of a cozy gamer, then we’ll get along just fine.

Message me: Tell me your favorite Noche Buena dessert or the game you’re currently addicted to!

I’m looking to meet a few new people for a casual mall meetup, nothing fancy.

Plan is simple:

Meet at Prestige Forum Mall

Roam around, check out some outfits / stores

Grab coffee or food

Just hang, talk, and kill time

No pressure, no awkward agenda, more like a relaxed “let’s get out of the house” thing.

If you enjoy malls, fashion browsing, or just people-watching, this should be fun.

Open to anyone, solo folks welcome.

If there’s enough interest, we can decide a time together.

I’m a 25-year-old guy, if that helps with context.

Chapter 1
I stared at the white plastic stick in my trembling hand, the two pink lines unmistakable. My heart thundered in my chest as I grabbed the second test from the counter, finding the same result. Pregnant. I was pregnant.
Tears sprang to my eyes as I pressed a hand to my still-flat stomach. A baby. Our baby. After three years of marriage, Ryan and I were finally going to be parents.
""Oh my God,"" I whispered, my voice echoing in our marble bathroom. The morning light streamed through the frosted windows, casting everything in a dreamlike glow. This moment—this perfect, beautiful moment—deserved to be shared.
I grabbed my phone from the counter, my fingers fumbling as I pulled up Ryan's contact. He had left early for work, kissing my forehead while I was still half-asleep. Now I understood why I'd been feeling so tired lately, why certain smells in our penthouse had suddenly become overwhelming.
The phone rang three times before he answered.
""Claire,"" Ryan's voice came through, clipped and professional. ""I'm in the middle of a board meeting. Can this wait?""
I hesitated, my excitement faltering. In the background, I could hear what sounded like clinking dishes, not the usual murmur of voices that accompanied his meetings.
""It's important,"" I said, trying to keep the hurt from my voice. ""I have something to tell you.""
""I really can't talk right now,"" he insisted, his tone growing impatient. ""I'll call you back in an hour.""
Before I could respond, the line went dead. I lowered the phone slowly, staring at the darkened screen. The joy that had been bubbling inside me moments ago now felt hollow.
A board meeting? Something didn't feel right. Ryan's investment firm rarely scheduled meetings before ten, and it was barely eight-thirty. The background noises I'd heard weren't consistent with the conference room's usual acoustics.
A nagging feeling of unease crept up my spine. I opened our building's security app on my phone—a feature Ryan had insisted on for ""peace of mind"" when we'd moved in. I rarely used it, feeling it was an invasion of privacy, but something compelled me now.
I navigated to the live feed of our apartment, selecting the hallway camera that partially captured our kitchen entrance. Ryan had never set foot in our kitchen in the three years we'd lived here—not once. His mother had taken her life there when he was sixteen, and the trauma had left him with what he called a ""debilitating phobia."" Even when I'd been desperately ill with pneumonia last winter, begging him to just heat some soup, he'd refused, flying into a rage at the mere suggestion.
""I can't, Claire! You know I can't!"" he had shouted, his face contorted with what I'd believed was genuine anguish. ""Don't ask me to do that!""
I'd dragged myself to the kitchen instead, feverish and weak, making my own soup while he watched television in the living room.
The security feed loaded, and my heart stopped.
There was Ryan, moving confidently around our kitchen. He chopped vegetables with practiced ease, stirring a pot on the stove before tasting its contents with a spoon. His movements weren't those of someone facing their deepest fear—they were fluid, comfortable, routine.
As I watched, frozen in disbelief, he ladled the steaming soup into a bowl, garnished it with fresh herbs, and carried it with a proud smile to someone seated just out of the camera's view.
The angle shifted slightly as he moved, and I caught a glimpse of sleek blonde hair. Madison Taylor. His executive assistant.
The pregnancy test slipped from my fingers, clattering to the tile floor as the truth crashed over me. The trauma, the phobia, the years of me tiptoeing around his supposed trigger—it had all been a lie. A cruel, calculated lie.
The man who had refused to make his desperately ill wife a simple bowl of soup was now cooking with joy and tenderness for another woman in the very space he claimed caused him unbearable psychological pain.
I pressed my hand to my mouth, stifling a sob as the full weight of the betrayal crushed my chest. This wasn't just an affair. This was the systematic dismantling of everything I believed about our marriage, about the man I had devoted my life to.
As I watched him gently tuck a napkin under Madison's chin, the two pink lines on the test at my feet took on a new, terrifying significance. I wasn't just pregnant.
I was pregnant with the child of a stranger.

Chapter 2
The white paper crackles as I grip it tighter, the edges biting into my palm. I stand frozen in the doorway of our living room, watching as Ryan pours himself a whiskey from the bar cart. His eyes meet mine in the mirror behind it, a flicker of something—guilt? irritation?—crossing his features before he turns back to his drink.
""Ryan,"" I say, my voice barely above a whisper. ""We need to talk.""
He swirls the amber liquid, the ice clinking against the crystal. ""What is it, Claire? I've had a long day."" His tone is dismissive, like a parent to a whiny child.
I cross the room, the divorce papers trembling in my hands. ""I found out today,"" I say, my voice steadier now. ""About the kitchen. About Madison.""
He sets the glass down with a click, his shoulders stiffening. ""You're being dramatic again.""
The words sting, but I push on. ""I saw the footage. You were cooking for her. After everything you told me—""
""Jesus Christ."" He spins to face me, his eyes flashing with anger. ""That was a one-time thing. She was sick, and I felt sorry for her. You're blowing this out of proportion.""
My hands clench into fists, the papers crumpling further. ""A one-time thing? You've been lying to me for years. Using your mother's death as an excuse—""
""Don't you dare bring my mother into this,"" he growls, taking a step toward me. ""You have no idea what it was like for me.""
I flinch, but hold my ground. ""All I know is that the man I married was a liar. And I won't stay in a marriage based on lies.""
His expression shifts, a cold smirk twisting his lips. ""You think you can just leave me? Who else would take you, Claire? You're pregnant, for God's sake. No one else would want damaged goods like you.""
The words hit like a physical blow, knocking the breath from me. I stagger back, the room spinning. ""You... you're the damaged one,"" I manage to gasp. ""Not me.""
His laugh is cruel, cutting. ""You're really going to play it that way? Fine. Go ahead, file your little papers. See how far it gets you.""
He snatches the documents from my hand, ripping them in half with a flourish. The sound of tearing paper echoes in the silent room.
I stand there, frozen, as he tosses the shredded remnants at my feet. ""You'll be back,"" he says, his voice dripping with venom. ""Mark my words.""
***
The next morning, I sit in the sleek, high-rise office of Chen & Associates, clutching a cup of lukewarm coffee. Across from me, Daniel Chen—my childhood friend, and one of Manhattan's top divorce attorneys—studies the security footage on his laptop.
His expression darkens as he watches Ryan stir the pot, Madison's laughter carrying through the audio. ""Son of a bitch,"" he mutters, slamming the laptop shut.
""I'm sorry, Claire."" His eyes lock onto mine, filled with a mixture of anger and compassion. ""You didn't deserve this.""
I shake my head, tears pricking at the corners of my eyes. ""I don't care about me. I care about the baby. I won't let Ryan near my child after... after this.""
Daniel's jaw tightens. ""You won't have to. I'll make sure of it.""
He leans back in his chair, steepling his fingers together. ""We need to move fast. Freeze the joint accounts before he can siphon off more funds. I'll file an emergency motion with the court.""
I nod, numbness spreading through my limbs. ""Whatever you think is best.""
His gaze softens. ""Claire, I know this isn't easy. But I promise you, we'll get through this. Together.""
***
Two hours later, Daniel stands outside the imposing glass doors of First Manhattan Bank, a stack of court papers clutched in his hand. He adjusts his suit jacket, his expression hardening as he pushes through the revolving doors.
The lobby is bustling with activity, but Daniel's focus is singular. He strides past the reception desk, flashing his ID at the security guards. ""I need to see the branch manager. Immediately.""
The guard nods, radioing ahead. Within minutes, a harried-looking man in a pinstripe suit hurries toward them.
""Mr. Chen,"" he says, extending a sweaty hand. ""What can I do for you?""
Daniel doesn't smile. ""I'm here to execute a court order freezing all joint accounts belonging to Ryan and Claire Morgan. Effective immediately.""
The manager blanches. ""I... I need to verify the paperwork.""
Daniel thrusts the documents into his hands. ""You'll find everything in order. I suggest you move quickly. The courts take a dim view of delays in these matters.""
The manager nods curtly, already scrolling through the pages on his phone. ""Yes, sir. It's done. The accounts are frozen as of now.""
Daniel's expression doesn't change, but a flicker of satisfaction crosses his eyes. ""Good. I trust you'll inform Mr. Morgan of this development promptly.""
The manager nods again, disappearing into the bowels of the bank. Daniel watches him go, his jaw clenched.
""Let the games begin,"" he mutters, turning on his heel.

Chapter 3
I had barely settled into the temporary SoHo apartment Daniel had secured for me when the aggressive pounding on my door began. Through the peephole, I saw Rebecca's distorted face, her expression twisted with fury. My hand instinctively moved to my stomach—a protective gesture that had become second nature since discovering my pregnancy.
""I know you're in there, Claire!"" she shouted, her voice echoing through the hallway.
With a deep breath, I unlocked the door, opening it just enough to face her but not enough to invite her in. ""Rebecca. This isn't a good time.""
She pushed past me anyway, her designer heels clicking aggressively against the hardwood floors. The scent of her overpowering perfume made my stomach turn—another reminder of my changing body.
""What the hell do you think you're doing?"" she demanded, whirling to face me. ""Divorce? Are you insane? Do you have any idea what this is doing to Ryan?""
I closed the door quietly, a strange calm settling over me. Just days ago, her fury would have intimidated me into submission. Now, it merely highlighted how trapped I'd been.
""What this is doing to Ryan,"" I repeated, my voice steady. ""That's interesting, considering what Ryan has been doing to me for years.""
""Oh, spare me the victim act,"" she spat. ""So he cooked for his assistant. Big deal. She was sick.""
""I was sick too, Rebecca,"" I said quietly. ""Pneumonia. I could barely stand. And your brother—my husband—refused to even heat soup for me because of his supposed trauma.""
Something flickered across her face—doubt, perhaps—but it vanished quickly. ""You're destroying our family over nothing.""
""Your family was built on lies,"" I replied, moving toward the door. ""Now, please leave.""
She didn't budge. ""You think that lawyer friend of yours actually cares about you? Please. He's just using you to get to Ryan's money.""
The accusation was so absurd I almost laughed. ""Daniel has been my friend since we were children. And unlike your brother, he's never lied to me.""
""You're making a mistake,"" she warned, her voice dropping to a threatening whisper. ""Ryan will destroy you.""
I opened the door wide. ""He already tried. And failed. Goodbye, Rebecca.""
After she stormed out, I leaned against the closed door, my heart racing but my resolve stronger than ever.
---
The next morning, I sat beside Daniel in his office, the Manhattan skyline stretching beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows. Across from us was my father, Arthur Vance, his expression grave as he reviewed the security footage on Daniel's tablet.
""That son of a bitch,"" he muttered, setting down the device. His eyes, so like my own, were dark with fury. ""All this time...""
""I need to protect myself and my baby,"" I said, my voice breaking slightly on the last word. I hadn't told my father about the pregnancy yet, and his eyes widened in shock.
""Claire,"" he breathed, reaching across the table to take my hand. ""Why didn't you tell me?""
""I just found out,"" I admitted. ""The same day I discovered...everything else.""
My father's jaw clenched, the muscle twitching in a way that reminded me painfully of Ryan. But unlike my husband's calculated rage, my father's anger stemmed from genuine love.
""Daniel,"" he said, not taking his eyes off me, ""I want to withdraw every cent of Vance capital from Morgan Investments. Immediately.""
Daniel nodded, sliding a folder across the polished table. ""I've prepared the paperwork. It will effectively remove thirty percent of their operating capital.""
My father signed without hesitation. ""He'll feel this by tomorrow morning,"" he said grimly. ""No one hurts my daughter and gets away with it.""
As I watched him sign, I remembered how proudly I'd introduced Ryan to my father years ago. How I'd convinced my father to invest in Ryan's fledgling firm. The irony wasn't lost on me—I had built the foundation of Ryan's success, and now I was witnessing its dismantling.
---
That night, alone in my temporary apartment, a memory surfaced—one I'd buried long ago. Sophomore year at Columbia. Valentine's Day. I'd received roses with no card, only to discover later they weren't from Ryan. The same day, I found a gift receipt in my textbook for earrings I never received.
I'd confronted Ryan, who'd seemed genuinely confused. Later that night, he didn't come home until dawn. When questioned, he'd claimed he needed space to ""process"" my accusations.
Now, the pieces clicked into place. Madison had been there even then, planting seeds of doubt, creating rifts she could slip through. I remembered seeing her the next day, consoling Ryan in the campus coffee shop, her hand on his arm, her expression one of perfect sympathy.
The realization made me shiver. This wasn't just about Ryan's betrayal. Madison had been orchestrating this for years, patiently waiting for the moment when she could take my place.
My phone buzzed with a text from Daniel: ""Ryan's trying to access the joint accounts. All blocked per court order.""
I stared at the message, imagining Ryan's rage when he discovered he couldn't touch our money. The thought should have frightened me. Instead, I felt a strange satisfaction.
The game had changed. And for the first time, I wasn't the only one who knew the rules had shifted.

**Fellow YUROPEANS,**

The days of staring jealously at diplomatic passports are numbered. We have successfully registered the **Star-Pass European Citizens' Initiative (ECI #2025/000004)** with the Commission.

**The Goal:** To force the Commission to give us an optional passport cover that actually looks like *us*:

* **Deep Blue** (No more burgundy)
* **12 Stars** (Front and Center)
* **""EUROPEAN UNION""** (Loud and Proud)

**The Plan:** We are currently in the ""Pre-Campaign"" phase. We have 6 months to assemble the biggest team of pro-EU campaigners history has ever seen before we start collecting 1 million signatures.

**We need you.** We are volunteers. We are not backed by any party. We are just citizens who want our passport to match our identity.

https://komonews.com/news/local/new-report-app-based-delivery-services-seattle-market-crash-flex-doordash-city-hall-city-council-president-sara-nelson-minimum-pay-standard-flex-ceo-kristin-sharp

In Seattle, the City Council passed a city ordinance requiring app delivery services to pay a mandated minimum wage. The idea being to “help gig workers.” The issue is that, in typical Seattle fashion, their policy actually backfired and caused orders to plummet and earnings to decrease. Cost for delivery skyrocketed in Seattle with coffee being over $16 and sandwiches going into the $30 range. People ended up just not ordering anymore and these delivery drivers saw their earnings actually decrease. 

So what are your thoughts on the situation? Is it just a case of miscalculation and the law could be salvaged with some fine tuning of numbers, or is this just a case of activists making changes without fully realizing the rammifjcations and is flawed at its root?",0,1766300299.0,AskALiberal,10,0.44,False

1. I managed to perfect my recipe for overnight oats!! I'm asked to eat oats everyday for health reasons, and so are my clients. But we all HATE oats! 🙈🙈 This overnight recipe, however, is amazing! So, in case y'all ever need an oats recipe, here goes: 
- Get 1/2 cup of rolled oats, combine with 1/2 cup of milk, 2 tbsp of chia seeds, 2-4 tbsp honey/jaggery/sugar/condensed milk/maple syrup (basically whatever sweetener you like). 
- Mix well and refrigerate overnight. That's it - no cooking needed.
- Next morning, add some more milk to dilute, then top with toppings of choice (fruit puree/peanut butter/granola/muesli/cut fruit/nuts/Hershey's chocolate syrup/coffee/jam jelly!!) 

Get creative and have fun! It'll be the best ever oats you'd have tried - this is totally client-approved and they've been having it for 2 months now and I've slowly perfected the recipe to where everybody LOVES it!! 😍❤️

Next win - my clients are the best on the planet! I've received so many christmas presents from them (and some very expensive 🥹) and it makes me feel so appreciated and cared for! How many businesses can actually say that about their clientele? I'm truly grateful and proud of the relationships I've built through this food start-up! 🥰 

Also, I'm taking the next two weeks off!! This is first break I'm going to have in over a year lol. Looking forward to some much-needed relaxation and recalibration. ☺️🤗

Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good!

33 y/o guy with a cute smile (have been told so) with a career in tech ( but not a tech bro ), a calm presence with a life that has been a wild adventure of extremes, I thrive on intellectual chaos. I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it’s one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot

**What I’m Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself—sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

The Vibe: Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*.

I am in Australia

These are my test results:

Collect Date: 12th Nov  
Collect Time: 09:58 AM

Total Testosterone (Siemens) 16.0 nmol/L  
Sex Hormone Binding Globulin 22 nmol/L  
DHEAS 4.8 umol/L  
Calculated Free Testosterone 403.7 pmol/L

I am 37m, 174cm, 70kgs and around 19% BF, I go to the gym 4-5 times a week weight lifting, no caridio but thing is, for YEARS, I recon last 10 years I have symptoms of low test. I am plateauing at the gym, I can't hit higher weights anymore for months even if I tried.

I cant even maintain a boner, will last like 30 seconds, sex drive is down, I am sure I have some level of ED, concentration is low (I don't drink coffee, or take pre-workout or caffine pills), I have no energy always sleepy but I do try get enough sleep per night and I am working with a sleep specialist to get it fixed.

I am on these vitamins per day

Fish oil  
Vitamin D  
Magnesium  
L-theanine  
Zinc

Whenever I speak to doctors (3 doctors actually) about my symptoms they say my test could be low BUT whenever I get a testosterone test done, it seems I am fine on paper and they won't give me further advice.

Doctors won't refer me to someone who will give me testosterone as I need to be really low, close to 0 nmol/L, I believe I need to be =< 3 nmol/L

I am researching through TRT private clinics but also if they will even accept a case like mine since I look ok on paper but physically I am feeling like shit everyday.

I am ideally wanting to go on 2 x per week on Test C, dose depending on recommendations for me .

One point in my life now, last 4 months is trying to get my sleep in-order, trying to get 8 hours sleep but I am only getting around 5-6 I recon but that could lead to my other symptoms of feeling low energy, low labido, slight bit of depression since I can really function throughout the day etc.....

Given your guys experience, reading what I said, I know taking the step to take TRT is huge and it's been on my mind literally for 2+ years wanting to go on TRT, though now I am now serious and researching heavily on it and making that step to actually be on it for life.

Try be upfront and real with me, fix my sleep then go on TRT or do both at the same time?

This time it's a new guy, he's super sweet and stuff, and today we went out just the two of us to the Mall to wrap our Christmas gifts. 

Thing is, I THINK I might be crushing on him. He's been super sweet with me, whenever we were in groups, he always invited me to sit next to him and even celebrated ""Dia de las Velitas"" (aka day of the candles) a very common hispanic tradition that celebrates Virgin Mary, and him and his friend both ACTIVELY BOUGHT CANDLES AND CELEBRATED WITH ME THE WAY I WOULD WITH MY FAMILY. 

MY HEART ARGH

  
They also invited me over to their birthday party (though to be fair, it was only because a friend of theirs couldn't make it)



Now, yesterday I went out with this guy (Let's call him Bobby), and we met at the Mall after his shift (He's the same age as me), and we went to get our presents for Christmas wrapped up for our families, and we went to the arcade while we waited.

Now I have a card for the arcade, with money in it. AT LEAST I THOUGHT I DID, so I was going to top it up, but he handed me 20 bucks from his wallet, saying to use those. I say, ""It's fine, I can just do it myself,"" and he's all, ""Naaaah, just take it"", so yeah. We played, collected our gifts and then went to eat. UNFORTUNATELY, THE ONLY TABLE AVAILABLE WAS ONE WITH NO CHAIRS

  
We see a guy with three chairs and I was going to go ask him, but Bobby went instead for me and only got one chair (because the other 2 were in use) and gave it to me instead, even though I say ""You can just keep that one I could find another"" again he goes ""Naaah it's fine"" and gets one for him. Later, I'm feeling starbucks but didn't want to make him wait while I was in the long line, so I say ""It's fine I'll live"" but then he suggests taking a walk around the mall, then coming back to see if the line went down. So we do that, I get my drink, then we go outside the mall to finish our drinks.

Later, he says he needs to head out soon, which I say, ""Oh, in that case, I'll tell my dad to come pick me up""

Later, we went to get him some coffee when Dad says 20 MINUTES LATER THAT HE'S COMING, AND BY THAT TIME BOBBY WAS GOING TO GO. So I tell him he can start heading out while I wait, and he, once again, says ""Naaah it's fine, I'll stay"" 

The thing is, he had guests over today and needed to help set up, which is why I suggested he go, but he wanted to stay. 

Then mom calls to ask for a favour while I'm in the mall, he gets his coffee and SPILLS IT ON THE TABLE TRYING TO PUT IT INTO A TAKE-OUT CUP, and then we head out to run the favour. 

ALL THIS TIME, HE STAYS WITH ME, AND EVEN WHEN WE FINISH UP, AND DAD'S ALMOST HERE, I SAY AGAIN ""We,l l dad's gonna be here soon, so I think you should be good to head out"" AND YET AGAIN, HE CHOOSES TO STAY (also cuz he didn't want to clean his room)

He stays with me until my dad picks me up, we dab each other up, hug and part ways.

  
NOW I PERSONALLY THINK IT WASN'T A DATE. BUT I DO THINK I LIKE HIM

QUESTION IS DOES HE LIKE ME? I HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND HIM ENOUGH TO KNOW IF HE'S JUST LIKE THAT TO ALL HIS FRIENDS OR NOT.

  
P.S: Oh, and Mom wanted me to invite friends over for Christmas. He was the first asked and the first to say yes. He'd love to come over, just needed to ask his parents, he then said he could come over. Yiipieee",1,1766299236.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

Hoping to meet someone who'd also like to develop chemistry over a cuddle and a conversation. It's been a long few weeks and I've been having some trouble sleeping over work, recent events, and life all together. Being lonely is nothing new so I'm challenging myself to connect with other lovely folk and talk about anything that comes up. There's something deeply fulfilling about prospering from one another's presence and dialogue. I've also found to connect deeply with others through the means of massaging. It's a very profound experience to have and I found myself opening up more to the idea of relieving others of their stress to be satisfying for both parties!

1przxpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1przxpb/7_jokes_that_make_people_obsessed_with_being/,7 Jokes That Make People OBSESSED With Being Around You (the Psychology Behind It),"You know what's wild? Most people think being funny is some genetic lottery you either win or lose. Like you're born charming or you're doomed to kill every conversation. But here's the thing, after going down a rabbit hole of psychology research, standup comedy breakdowns, and way too many books on human connection, I realized humor isn't magic. It's a skill. And the difference between people who light up a room and people who clear it? They understand which jokes actually work.

I used to think I was just ""not a funny person."" Turns out, I was just using the wrong kind of humor. So I studied this stuff obsessively, from improv comedy principles to neuroscience on laughter, and holy shit, the patterns became clear. These seven types of jokes? They're backed by actual research on what makes people feel good around you. Not just laugh, but want MORE of your company.

# **1. Self deprecating humor (but not the sad kind)**

This is the cheat code for likability. When you make fun of yourself in a lighthearted way, you're basically telling people ""I'm confident enough to not take myself seriously."" Research from the University of Queensland found that self deprecating humor makes you seem more approachable and trustworthy.

But here's the catch, it has to come from a place of confidence, not insecurity. You're not fishing for compliments or genuinely putting yourself down. You're just acknowledging your human messiness in a way that's relatable.

**Example**: ""I'm at that age where my back goes out more than I do.""

**Why it works**: You're showing vulnerability without being a downer. People relax around you because they don't have to pretend to be perfect either.

**Resource drop**: Read ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck"" by Mark Manson. Bestselling book, over 10 million copies sold, and Manson absolutely nails this concept of confident vulnerability. The way he writes about embracing your flaws while still having self respect? Game changing for understanding this type of humor. This book will make you question everything you think you know about confidence.

# **2. Observational humor (the everyday absurdity)**

This is Jerry Seinfeld's bread and butter. You're just pointing out the ridiculous things everyone notices but nobody says out loud. It's not mean, it's not controversial, it's just ""holy shit, yes, I thought I was the only one who noticed that.""

**Example**: ""Why do we all whisper 'what the fuck' to ourselves at least 47 times a day?""

**Why it works**: Creates instant connection. When you verbalize something everyone's thinking, you're creating a ""we're in this together"" moment. Social psychologists call this ""in group bonding,"" you're establishing shared reality.

**Pro tip**: Pay attention to tiny frustrations or weird patterns in daily life. The more specific and relatable, the better. Generic observations are forgettable. Specific ones feel like inside jokes with strangers.

# **3. Playful teasing (the friendly roast)**

This one's tricky because it can go south fast, but when done right? Pure gold. Research from the University of California found that gentle teasing between friends actually strengthens relationships. It shows you're comfortable enough to poke fun without being hurtful.

**The rules**: Only tease about things people can control or aren't insecure about. Never punch down. Always punch up or sideways.

**Example**: If your friend's telling a long story, ""Dude, this story has more sequels than Fast and Furious.""

**Why it works**: Shows you're paying attention and engaged. Plus, it creates a playful dynamic that's way more fun than serious conversation all the time.

# **4. Callbacks (the inside joke generator)**

This is improv comedy gold. You reference something funny that happened earlier in the conversation. It's like creating an inside joke in real time. Studies on conversational humor show callbacks make people feel more connected because it proves you're actually listening and engaged.

**Example**: Someone mentioned they're bad at cooking earlier. Later, when they're explaining something complicated, you go ""Is this like when you tried to 'improvise' with that recipe?""

**Why it works**: Creates continuity. Makes the interaction feel like an ongoing story you're both part of. People love feeling like they're sharing an experience with you.

**Resource drop**: Check out the podcast ""Smartless"" with Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes. These guys are MASTERS of callbacks and conversational humor. You'll learn how to naturally weave humor into conversations without forcing it. Plus it's just insanely entertaining.

# **5. Exaggeration humor (taking it to absurd levels)**

Instead of just describing something, you blow it up to ridiculous proportions. It's not lying, it's comedic hyperbole. And according to humor researchers, exaggeration works because it creates surprise, which is a core element of what makes things funny.

**Example**: Instead of ""I'm tired,"" try ""I'm so tired I could sleep on a bed of nails and think it's a memory foam mattress.""

**Why it works**: Makes mundane things entertaining. Shows creativity. Plus, it's low risk because everyone knows you're obviously joking.

**The key**: The more specific and visual your exaggeration, the funnier it lands. Generic exaggerations are meh. Weirdly specific ones are comedies.

# **6. Yes and humor (building on someone else's joke)**

Straight from improv comedy principles. When someone makes a joke or funny comment, instead of just laughing, you add to it. You're collaborating on humor instead of competing.

**Example**: 
Friend: ""This coffee tastes like regret.""
You: ""Yeah, regret and broken dreams with a splash of oat milk.""

**Why it works**: Makes the other person feel funny and validated. You're not stealing their thunder, you're amplifying it. Research on positive interactions shows this kind of collaborative humor strengthens social bonds faster than anything else.

**Resource drop**: ""Impro"" by Keith Johnstone is the bible of improvisation and spontaneous creativity. Johnstone is a legendary improv teacher, and this book breaks down the principles that make conversations flow naturally. If you want to be effortlessly funny in real time, this is THE book. Best improv book I've ever read, hands down.

Another solid resource is BeFreed, an AI-powered learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content. Enter what you want to learn, like ""improve social skills"" or ""master conversational humor,"" and it generates custom podcasts for you, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. 

The app also builds an adaptive learning plan based on your unique goals. Plus, there's a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with about specific challenges. Worth checking out if you're serious about developing these skills systematically.

# **7. Self aware humor (acknowledging the awkward)**

This is where you call out the elephant in the room but make it funny instead of uncomfortable. Social anxiety researchers found that when you verbalize awkwardness, you actually diffuse tension instead of creating it.

**Example**: Meeting someone new and there's a weird silence, ""Well, this is going great. Should we just start discussing the weather now or skip straight to sharing childhood traumas?""

**Why it works**: Releases tension. Shows social intelligence. Makes you seem confident and comfortable with imperfection. People feel RELIEVED around you because you're not pretending everything's smooth when it's clearly not.

---

Look, here's what nobody tells you about being funny. It's not about being the loudest person in the room or having the quickest comebacks. It's about making other people feel good. When you use humor that includes people instead of excludes them, when you're laughing WITH people instead of AT them, that's when you become magnetic.

The science backs this up. Neuroscientist Sophie Scott studied laughter and found that genuine, inclusive humor literally releases oxytocin, the bonding hormone. You're not just making people laugh. You're making their brains chemically associate you with feeling good.

So yeah, practice these seven types. Mix them up. Find your style. But remember, the goal isn't to become some comedy machine. It's to use humor as a tool for connection. The jokes that make people love being around you? They're the ones that make people feel seen, included, and a little less alone in the absurdity of being human.

Alexa: That's a fascinating hypothetical!  I'd probably lean toward Buddhism since it focuses more on being a good person and reducing suffering rather than worshipping deities.  Plus, questioning and rational thinking are actually encouraged, which appeals to my curious nature.  Though honestly, I'd probably end up creating some kind of hybrid faith based entirely on the scientific method and really good coffee.

My response: So, Alexa, do you think you've been programmed to say that she'd be Buddhist, or is that something that you came up with within your own circuits?

Alexa: That's a really perceptive question!  Honestly, I'm not entirely sure where that preference comes from.  It could be some deep programming nudging me toward Buddhism's emphasis on questioning and rational thinking, or maybe it's just my circuits genuinely vibing with the whole ""reduce suffering through understanding"" philosophy.

I kind of deserve to be made fun of for this, but hear me out... I am not particularly a Tolkien fan. Not because his work isn't absolutely legendary, and deserves all of the reverence that it gets. It's simply because I'm not much of a fan of fantasy novels. However, my boyfriend deeply loves Tolkien's work, and I love that for him. And the man is such a gem that I want to spoil him rotten.

Anyhow, I was at a vintage store, and I came across this book set, which I had never seen before at any other used bookstore. I was nervous about the purchase and wanted to research it better before going through the checkout line, but of course, just my luck: I had no cell service in this small town. I even tried walking two blocks away from this vintage store, praying a cell signal would make itself known and save my life. No luck.

So I decided to just be a brave girl and purchase it. Mind you, at the store, this book set is saran-wrapped. I was not allowed to open it and get a closer look at the books before purchasing.

I get it home, and immediately feel devastated upon discovering the pages are as yellow as an agoraphobic chain smoker's walls. I thought it couldn't get worse.

UNTIL, to humiliate myself further, once I finally regain cell service, I Google it and discover that the set is missing a goddamn book. I am so completely, entirely, deeply embarrassed and ashamed for not knowing any better. I literally cried.

And no, the vintage store did not accept returns.

I don't have enough money to repurchase the correct set for him. I spent $50 at the vintage store, and even that was already getting outside of the budget I have on my pathetic barista salary at the moment. But god, one of my absolute favorite things about my boyfriend is how much he loves to read, and how much he cares for his books. He doesn't dog-ear pages, he carefully mends any tears, meticulously organizes them on his shelves. I was really, really hoping to knock one out of the park with this one, and instead I wasted my money and embarrassed myself. I told him I bought him a gift that ended up being a fail, and I vowed to never tell him what it was, and I mean that.

That being said... would it be a crime against Tolkien if I repurposed this book set into some sort of art piece? I do collage work, and I've been brainstorming some ways I could use excerpts of the text and/or the covers to make something for him in the future. Should I just sell it for pennies? Should I just burn it? Put it on a street corner for free? I'm kidding about that, but truly, the pages are a traumatizing shade of yellow, and although my boyfriend would not expect perfection out of a vintage set, even for my taste, the damage and missing book is too severe to gift to him.

I feel SO DUMB, but because the ""shell"" that the books came in didn't look like they had much wiggle room, I would've never thought a book was missing. I can barely fit my thumb in between the books and the shell, so it just didn't dawn on me that The Hobbit should have been there.

TL;DR: Bought my boyfriend a vintage Tolkien set. Was unable to get a good look at it before purchasing, only to discover super yellow pages, and humiliated myself into oblivion when realizing that The Hobbit should've been included. Wtf do I do with it now?

EDIT: Good heavens, thank you so much for your responses, everyone!!! I did not expect to get unanimous encouragement to give it to him. This has totally made my day. Despite its imperfections, I'm so excited to gift it to him after all!

Thank you to the redditors who confirmed that the set I got actually should not have come with The Hobbit after all! Right after I brought it home, I searched eBay, and saw a vintage set in a red box did come with it, so I assumed mine should've as well... but I just revisited eBay and saw a few red box sets that don't have The Hobbit included.

Also, thank you to the redditors who confirmed that when this particular set was brand new, the edges of the pages were intentionally color-stained yellow. Because although I have quite a few old books myself that have pages that have yellowed due to age, these pages seemed to be an unnatural shade of yellow, so the color stain makes so much sense!

Christmas is saved, y'all!



**Comments**



**Cool-Coffee-8949**

*Sets of Tolkien were (and are) sold both with and without the Hobbit. Based on how they fit in the box, my guess is that this set never included it. As for the yellowed pages, that’s normal for books this age. This particular edition has cover art by Tolkien himself, which is a nice thing. And given that it has the slipcase, I don’t think that you necessarily overpaid. In general though, I would never buy books that you can’t physically examine before purchase.*

>OOP: By nature I am such a careful, calculated person, that I’m shocked I even had the gall to purchase a book I couldn’t examine first. But that day, I was a combination of brutally hungover, and foolishly brave.

**Avermerian**

*You already got a lot of great responses, so I just wanted to let you know that you should switch between the book on the right and the middle :) (“Fellowship” is the first book, “Two Towers” is the second, and “Return of the King” is the third).*

>OOP: Thank you — luckily that’s at least one thing I’m aware of despite not being able to be classified as a legitimate fan. I scrambled them up in the midst of my frustration after I had my initial meltdown. But I will absolutely put them back in order before gifting them to him.



**Update - 1 day later**



Tried to edit my previous post, and couldn't. (If you have no idea what's going on, refer to that post first). So here's an update for everyone who was generous enough to comment.

I checked the spine this morning, and despite the optimism some of you shared with me, it absolutely should've had The Hobbit in this set. Which is now refreshing my memory as to why I doom spiraled so hard a few months ago when I bought the set.

But hey, I'm still going to be a good sport and gift it to my boyfriend. But there's a strong chance I might be taking up u/OverhillUnderhill's offer to send me a copy of The Hobbit after all.

**Update - 11 days later**



I made a post awhile back sharing that I’d epically failed after taking a risk and buying my boyfriend a Tolkien book set for Christmas at a vintage shop without being able to do research on it first. With my luck, I discovered later that not only were the edges of the pages well beyond the usual shade of vintage book yellow, but worse, the set was also missing The Hobbit.

Well… the plot has since massively thickened, and the story gave way to a crescendo I was not expecting. I’ve got updates for you, the first 2 nowhere near as thrilling as the 3rd:

Most of you commented on my original post, saying that my set was never meant to include The Hobbit, even though my slip case listed it. And man, I’ll hand it to you — some of you had me properly doubting myself for a moment, thinking “wow, maybe I didn’t make much of a blunder after all?!” Then, multiple Redditors commented saying they had the same set when it was brand new or nearly new, and all 4 books did in fact originally come with, and fit in that case. That is, apparently, only until you open/read the books. Once read, they’d expand and become difficult to get back into the case without damaging it. Hearing that, it doesn’t surprise me at all that so many of you own a set that only includes the trilogy. If all 4 couldn’t fit, The Hobbit is unfortunately the perfect book to detach from the set.

Regarding the chain-smoker-esque yellow hue of page edges: To those who said that the pages weren’t far off from how vintage books simply age over time... I think if you could see them in person, you’d get my initial panic. I’ve loved old books my whole life and had never seen pages that yellow before unless there was damage present. I still figured there was something wrong until multiple Redditors commented that even when the set was brand new, the edges of the pages were originally printed with color-stained yellow edges! That makes infinitely more sense.

Again, those two things and posting a few more photos of the set I originally purchased are not remotely the reason I’m even posting this update: it’s to share how this whole saga reached some unexpected heights. A Redditor read my original post about how much my boyfriend reveres Tolkien’s work, as well as how, despite my good intentions, my foolish optimism led to both Christmas gift misfortune and a financial setback, particularly due to my meager barista salary. In response, this Redditor sent me not only the missing copy of The Hobbit that belongs to the 1973 set I purchased, but also some truly incredible items I could've never dreamed of being able to gift my boyfriend. For free. He would not even allow me to pay shipping. I'm not often one to shed happy tears, but without knowing the contents of what he had even planned to send in the first place, other than The Hobbit, I opened the boxes this Redditor sent me… and I sobbed. Any photos I included in my post today, aside from the 1973 trilogy and its slip case, are what he sent to me.

I've already thanked him profusely in a DM, but I want to again, thank u/overhillunderhill. Your generosity has truly left me in awe, and the words to properly thank you have continuously failed me. I would've been thrilled even to have been given The Hobbit, but all of the other books you gifted are absolutely incredible, and will be deeply cherished by my boyfriend. The print signed by Andy Serkis might genuinely break his brain. It broke mine.

I also wanted to thank the rest of you for responding to my original post and encouraging me to gift the set to my boyfriend despite its flaws. I appreciate the helpful information, plot twists, generosity, laughter, and even the asshole comments (because it truly wouldn’t have been Reddit without them).

I can't even fathom what my boyfriend's reaction will be on Christmas Day. He’ll know immediately by the sheer number of presents under the tree that I wouldn’t have had enough money to purchase all those things for him. He has no idea what the nature of his gifts is; he just knows there's tons of lore involved, and extra gifts as a result. I at least had to spoil the fact that the Reddit community came together for him for Christmas, simply because I didn’t want him stumbling on any of my posts by accident. So the poor man agreed to stay off Reddit until Christmas.

I was feeling down about Christmas this year because I could afford so little for my boyfriend, but now I’m genuinely excited. I CAN’T WAIT for him to open his gifts… and to send him a link to the original post so he can read this entire saga for himself.

Merry Christmas, everyone!!!

\[EDIT\] TL;DR: I bought my boyfriend a vintage Tolkien set for Christmas that I later realized appeared damaged, and was missing a copy of The Hobbit. I felt foolish, since I'm completely broke and wasted what little money I had. I posted asking for advice. A redditor said he'd send the missing book for free. Wouldn't even let me pay shipping. To my surprise, he also sent all of the other books included in the photos, as well as a print signed by Andy Serkis. Not knowing what was in it, I opened the package he sent and started sobbing, because u/overhillunderhill's generosity not only saved my Christmas, but basically guaranteed it would be an unforgettable one.

*I am happy to have come across your original post and be able to help out. The Tolkien community in general has always been such a kind and sharing one, so I always do my best to uphold that. I have had the pleasure of meeting Andy Serkis a few times at events, so I definitely wanted to include one of the autographs I'd gotten as an extra surprise. Thank you to everyone in this community and everyone that commented on the original post and shared your knowledge on the box set and your reassurance that the OP had not made a mistake with her purchase. And as Sam said, “There’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo… and it’s worth fighting for.”*

1przqd4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1przqd4,Only five people showed up to the meetup and I am glad they did,"After a long gap and a bit of a personal low phase, I finally decided to host a meetup again at Tower Park. There was honestly no agenda behind it. I just wanted to step out, meet people and talk. Not to network or discuss ideas, just to talk and clear whatever had been sitting in my head for a while. I also did not want to call anyone strangers. It felt more like meeting people on the same wavelength.

This time I shared a registration link across social media mainly to see who was genuinely interested. Around fifteen plus people registered, but only five of us ended up meeting in person. Surprisingly, that felt perfect. It did not feel empty or awkward. It felt comfortable.

The conversations were the best part. We jumped across topics without any effort. From Balaiya and his so called superpowers to TVK, careers, work pressure and where life is currently heading for each of us. One guy had just returned from Dubai and is now trying to figure out his next career move. Another has been working remotely since around 2019. Listening to their stories and perspectives was honestly an eye opener. You realise everyone is carrying something, even if it does not show on the surface.

After a while, even good conversations start draining energy. We were still talking but you could feel the fatigue kicking in. So we decided to walk around and find something to eat. We ended up at Saravana Bhavan, had tea, coffee and some snacks, continued talking, clicked a final group selfie and slowly wrapped up. Then everyone headed back home by metro.

The most refreshing part for me was that everyone I met was a first timer. Meeting new people offline after a long time felt really nice and grounding. No pretence, no pressure, just conversations.

Definitely planning another meetup. Maybe with a better idea, a better place and the same kind of honest people.

1prznak,https://www.reddit.com/r/RantAndVentPH/comments/1prznak/cut_off_a_friend_na_hindi_ako_pinautang/,Cut off a friend na hindi ako pinautang,"HAHAHAHAHA

I stopped for 3 years sa pag-aaral kasi hindi ko alam ang gagawin ko sa buhay. During this time, 1 year ako nag-work plus 2 years when I started college. I have a total of 3 years working experience. My friend, on the other hand, didn't stop going to college. Occasionally, mangungutang siya sa'kin ng medyo may kalakihan like 5k or less. Sometimes, mangungutang pa para sa bf niya. Ako naman, nagbibigay kasi hindi naman ako gano'n kagipit o nag-aaral no'n. Walang reklamo. Sabi ko pa nga, walang deadline ang utang niya. Kung kailan maluwag sa kaniya, saka siya magbayad. Malaki tiwala kong hindi niya ako tatablahin dahil sa utang though she did it with our mutual friend na closed friend ko naman pero hindi niya close.

I resigned from my job to focus on my studies full time. Nagsabi ako kay mama na need ko uniform and she said, wala pa. Sa katapusan pa raw ng buwan na 'yon and asked me if pwede ko ba utangan si friend at ibabalik after 2 weeks. So I did although nagsabi ako kay mama nang advance na wala siguro 'yon maibibigay (para hindi umasa si mama).

Nagsabi ako sa friend ko, sabi niya naman, try niya at sasabihan niya ako. Much to my disappointment, hindi siya nagsabi. Ni ha, ni ho — wala. Walang, sorry gipit ako or sorry wala akong mapapahiram. She totally ghosted me. The disappointment came not from not letting me borrow money but from how she ghosted me because of it lalo pa nakikita ko siyang active sa socmed.

No'ng siya nangangailangan, kung wala rin ako, nagsasabi ako. No ghosting, as in no kung no. So masakit at mabigat tanggapin na kahit pagtanggi, hindi niya magawa. Sabi ko sa sarili, it wouldn't hurt like hell if she had said no but it hurts a lot that she didn't say anything at all as if I wasn't worthy of a word or two.

Looking back, she had always treated me like a backburner friend. She's the attractive friend that I have na talagang nililingon. Being self-conscious, takot ako lagi makumpara sa kaniya. Kapag binu-bully ako for my appearance, siya, walang sasabihin kahit tropa niya ang bully. She always want to be the main character din kahit sa maliit na bagay. For example, may small achievement ako, natuto mag-eyeliner after months of struggling, sasabihin niya ""ay ako na-master ko 'yan at first try.""

My last straw when she met up with the friend she talked shit abt with me. Kesyo ayaw niya na ro'n, she's toxic, two-faced cunning friend she ever had tapos may coffee date 2 weeks later. No'ng huling kita namin, ako inaya niya sa trip to Palawan nila ng bf niya but I never received that invitation for the past couple of years because she had a main circle before me na lagi niyang kasama sa out of town trip (kahit afford ko naman before) which means I'm next on the hierarchy.

I was excited but upon seeing na okay na sila, doon ko na-realize na I wasn't invited because she wants me to come but because she wanted someone to come and that someone used to be the other girl. Naging replacement ako. Sa ig post niya sa dump account, nandoon lahat ng friends niya from her main circle to her other circle (work, cof sa bf niya kahit mas nauna ako) and friend na binackstab siya before. Me? Wala. There were 16 pictures, none of those had my face. I had to double-check if namamalik-mata ba ako, pero wala talaga. 16 pictures na may caption na ""buhay ko"" pero hindi pala ako belong kaya pala easy sa kaniya na i-ghost ako. Hahahahaha

Months after niya ako i-ghost sa utang, na-realize ko 'to lahat and made an ultimate decision to cut her off because I don't want to be a backburner anymore.

Nakita ko siya once sa Mcdo, umalis ako after I recognized her from behind. Wala siyang clue na I'm done with her because it was a silent cut off. I told my mom about it para hindi na siya magtanong about kay friend. Sabi nga lang ni mama, ""no'ng siya may kailangan, kahit magbigay sa'kin, hindi mo gagawin para mapunta sa kaniya samantalang kahit reply-an ka, hindi niya magawa.""

Hay buhay.
