Over the years, my dad got promoted, and our financial situation improved. 

Alhamdullilah I got a good job and pay, but I hate spending. Even my local friends call me بخيل when I tell them about the way I spend.

For example, I prefer to get married in court. I don’t give the woman anything, because we can spend that money on the wedding on our honeymoon or house. It is just one night, I don’t care about seeing people on my wedding.

Another example is I find the coffee from some shops expensive. Paying 30 dhs for a small cup of coffee in places like Rain is ridiculous, when you can buy a large size of Starbucks/Tim Hortons for the same price.

My mother gets mad at me because my wardrobe hasn’t changed. I keep wearing the same polos and joggers and when we go out to the mall she insists on buying me new clothes, from her own pocket money, which is from my salary 🤣

There are exceptions on things I am not stingy about. I love to spend on food.

I love to spend on gym equipment.

Am I the only one who grew up stingy? I see lots of my Emirati friends spending on fancy things and trying to live a “posh” lifestyle, but I don’t feel the pressure or the need to be like them.",1,1747685439.0,Emiratis,1,1.0,False

1kqlt0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sasquatch_Nazi/comments/1kqlt0p/fuckboy_and_tex_the_legend_of_john_prick/,Fuckboy and Tex: The Legend of John Prick,"My buddy, Tex, and myself were sitting out on the prairie watching the sunset when the topic of my past as a porn movie producer came up in discussion.  It went down like this. Tex turned to me and asked, “Fuck Boy, what’s the biggest pecker you ever seen in your time making fuck flicks?”  I commenced to regale Tex in stories of monster dongs!  When I finished, ole Tex asked, “Yeah, that is some mighty fine cock stories, I tell ya what.  But which one was THE BEST?”

 

I leaned back against the rock that sat behind me.  Here it was.  It was time to tell MY story.  I looked over at Tex and asked, “Tex, have you ever heard of a man by the name of John Prick?”  Tex shook his head.  I continued, “Well then, sit back and relax, because I am going to tell you the story of John Prick”.

 

Back in the height of the porn world in 1975, we were all coked out of our brains.  There were schlongs a’plenty, and too few holes to stick them into.  To get in the movies you had to have just the right wang.  You were judged on many factors.  First and foremost, your cock had to be long, 7’’ minimum.  Any less than that and you were laughed out of the room.  And on some sets, even 7’’ would get you laughed out of the room.

 

Second, it needed to have girth.  We used the beer can test.  Now, a 7 incher can get high marks if it is big around, and an 8 incher can get marked down if it is a pencil dick.  The best trouser snakes had both length and girth. 

 

Third, it had to be pretty.  Uncircumcised cocks, like the Jews to which they are attached, were not welcome in the porn industry.  They look gross and they are less clean, causing them to smell like un-douched pussy.  Weird moles and flesh wounds were deal breakers too.

 

Fourth, they had to stay hard for long periods of time, and regain erection quickly after you shoot your sacks.  If it took you a long time to recharge, then you are not going to be in the dirty movie business very long. 

 

I did not do the cock work for our movies.  I had a guy named Peter Long who handled them.  My talent was in recruiting lovely young ladies to be in our films.  This grew out of my talent for finding coke and being able to identify a chick with daddy issues. 

 

One day on the set Peter came running in, all in a tizzy.  Me and Eddie “Big Stick” Hammerhead were doing blow and playing cards while our dudes were getting fluffed for a scene.  Peter exclaimed, “Rod!!! You got to come see this cock!!!!”  I was like, “Goddamn, Peter.  I got you to do that.  You’re the fucking homo.  I like pussy.” 

 

Peter retorted, “Yeah, but we both know what you like MOST of all, don’t we?”  I took off my aviator sunglasses and turned to Pete.  “You talking bout money?!?”, I asked.  Peter said “Bingo!”.  I got up and went with Peter.  I was getting excited.  I had not seen Peter so excited since his doctor told him that the new virus, HIV, was nothing to worry about and that he would be over it in a couple weeks, just like with a cold. 

 

Pete and I walked into the display room.  Peter said “TA DA!!!!”.  Standing there was a normal looking dude in a speedo.  He was built ok.  He had sort of long, scraggly jet-black hair.  He was decent enough looking, I thought.  Then I said to him, “OK, let me see your package.  Well, the guy dropped his package and “THUD!!!”, it fell onto the floor!  Peter let out a small yet excited shriek.  The cigarette between my lips fell out of my mouth and hit the floor.  This guy’s schlong was HUGE!! 

 

I walked over to it, never letting my eyes move from it.  I pulled out the tape measure in my pocket and took a measurement. It was 37 fucking inches long - flaccid!  “Holy shit!”, I muttered.  The dude asked what I was doing.  I told him to shut the fuck up.  Then I did a girth measurement.  He was as thick as a Folgers coffee can!! I told the guy to get dressed and meet my in my office in five minutes. 

 

Honestly, I had to go to the men’s room and splash cold water on my face.  I was in shock at the prospect of all the motherfucking dough I was going to make off this fucker.  I dropped a couple ludes to calm myself.  Then I went to the meeting. 

 

It was just this guy and me in my office/utility closet.  The first thing I did was tell him to sit down.  “Go on, have a seat, my boy!! Take a fucking load off!  Ha ha ha ha!! Hey, ya want to do some coke before we start talking?” 

 

The guy was not down to clown.  I made a mental note immediately to do a background check on the guy to make sure he was not Five-O.  “What the fuck is your name, son?”, I asked.  He said his name was “John Prick”.  I said, “That’s a pretty catchy name ya got there!!”, I complimented him.

 

Then I asked him where he is from.  He explained that he was originally from Belarus.  He was an orphan.  But as a young man he was recruited into an organized criminal organization, where he was trained in the ancient ways of being a master cocksman.  He studied from the masters to develop his stroke.  They soon learned that John was not an ordinary student.  He was gifted.  He was destined to be an exceptional cocksman.  The training became more rigorous and time consuming.  If he failed to respond, then he was beaten mercilessly.  He was turned into a total fuck monster! 

 

Then, in order to instill discipline and moral order, they sent John Prick to a monastery for 5 years to learn from a silent sect of Tibetan monks.  Finally, after 10 long years of arduous training, where each and every lesson was a hard-fought battle to learn, coupled with his natural talents, John Prick earned the title of “Master Cocksman”. 

 

He finished his back story and sought my reaction.  Silently, John Prick raised his stare toward me.  I had zoned out long ago and was at that moment ordering a pizza from Sal’s Pizzeria down the street.  “Yeah, I want pepperoni on the whole goddamned thing.  Got it?  Oh, and send that girl of yours, what’s her name – Brandy, Barbera, whatever the fuck … Send her over with the pie.  She’s got a nice little wiggle in her ass, ya know?  Heh heh heh…” 

 

I hung up the phone and turned back to John Prick.  I asked, “So where were we?  Something about jacking off on a pheasant?  Look kid, I am all into the weird shit and I appreciate your commitment, I do.  But I got to draw the line at bestiality. The goddamn government will come in here and shut me down, you know?”    

 

John Prick asked, “So what now?”  I told him, “So what now is that you is gonna march yer skinny white ass into the next room and start boning some chicks.”  John Prick then asked, “So, I’ve got the job?”  I held up my hand and replied, “Uh … No no no, you got to pass the test first.  I got to know that you are the right material to be an on-camera fuck boy.  I need to see you on the job first.” 

 

I took John Prick and put him on set.  We filmed it too.  First, I put him in bed with “Sista Melissa”.  It was fine, pretty much what you would expect from a rookie.  Then I sent over the Double-D twins to see if they could break his cock.  Not a chance!! They boy performed like a true stud! 

 

I wanted to see where the limits were with this kid.  So, as he and the twins were slopping it up, I sent over old Hammering Hank Hawg Leg to plow one of the twins while John Prick was boning the other one.  The kid kept on pumping like a champ! 

 

I then ran John Prick through some arduous endurance drills.  I made him bang 5 broads in a row to conclusion, with only a 2-minute snoot break between chicks.  As it turned out, he only needed 30 seconds and he was ready to go again.  I was stunned!!! I had never seen such endurance in a fuck boy!! He was truly a miracle of nature. 

 

Finally, I had to put a stop to it because John Prick’s huge member was absolutely destroying my girls’ twats.  I had to give them all a couple nights off before I could film them again.  They were so stretched out that fucking them would be like throwing a hot dog down a hall way! 

 

John Prick asked me again if he had the job. I looked over at him and told him that his work had been mighty impressive up to that point.  But I had one more test for him.  But first I had to impart some wisdom.  “Look here, Johnathan, you got to understand something about the business.  My investors, see, they expect results.  I mean, I could focus on substance, and maybe make the Casablanca of fuck films.  But why bother?  All people want to see is hot, sweaty flesh flopping together and chicks getting’ their eyes glued shut, am I right?”

 

I continued, “Now, John, if a movie gets held up because my star stud can’t keep his dick hard, and I can’t get it done in time to be distributed, that don’t matter to the boys in finance.  See, most finance people will sue you in a court if you don’t pay them.  But my finance guys will come break my fucking knee caps, capisce?  So, if you don’t fuck long and hard, then I may get fucked.  And if I get fucked, then we all is fucked.  Do you understand?”  John looked at me and simply said “Yeah”.

 

I told John “OK, look, I got one more test for you.  There is one more person I want to see you fuck.  Hey, Freddy!!! Get your fat ass in here!!”.  Freddy is the maintenance man at the company.  He is 5’7’’ and weighs 400-plus pounds.  He is ugly as sin and is covered with hair.  He also has a very prominent brow, which makes him look like a fucking cave man. 

 

Freddy came hobbling in, walking with a limp.  He asked me, “Yeah, whatcha need, boss?”.  I told him to strip nude and lie on the bed on his stomach.  He then asked, “What then, boss?”.  I replied, “See this here Slavic looking Gabon? He is going to come over there and fuck you up your ass.”  Freddy replied, “OK, boss”, and did what I told him to do. 

 

I noticed a concerned look come over John Prick’s face.  I pointed to Freddy, who was by that point bare ass naked and had his hairy, stinking ass up in the air, and periodically blasting toxic gas from it.  “Go on, John.  Go fuck that hairy sack of shit!”.  John looked at me and quietly asked “What?”.  I told him to get his skinny ass to work or else I was gonna box him up in a crate and ship him back to Russia or wherever the fuck he came from. 

 

But John Prick, it turns out, was a complete fucking pro!!  I made him screw Freddy 5 times in a row, with no rest breaks in between.  He applied large voluminous money shots to Freddy’s face each time.  When I finally called a wrap, poor Freddy’s head looked like it had been dipped in vanilla pudding.  I told Freddy, “Go get cleaned up, Freddy.”  “OK, boss”, he replied.

 

I took John Prick back to my office.  I gave him the job that night, but only after I taught him to dig blow and Scotch, and how to shoot a fucking gun, you know, in case those finance boys show up to break my fucking knee-caps again.  By the time I was done with him, John Prick was a fucking Porn Hero!

 

John Prick stayed in my employ for only 6 weeks.  But during that time, I was able to make 72 full length features with him.  When the pay checks started bouncing, so did he.  He went on to some other porn outfit that agreed to pay him.  But the joke was on both of them.  I got the best years out of John Prick. ME…MY FILMS!!!  I captured the true John Prick, the best there ever was, and the best there will EVER be!!  After he left me he was a washed-up junkie who could not keep his dick hard without drugs or a brace. The business chewed him up and shit him out. A year later he was found dead in some back alley drug deal gone wrong.  What a fucking waste!  But man, the fucking money I made using him!! Ha ha ha ha ha ha hah!!!!!

 

At the end of my story, I turned to Tex and said, “Tex, John Prick was, by far, the best cocksman I have ever had the pleasure to pimp on screen.  If I had a couple more years with him, I would have been a fucking millionaire. But see, to be a great porn stud, you have to live a hard, regret-filled life.  It is just part of who you are if you are going to do that work.  If John Prick was going to be the best, then he was destined to burn out so soon.” 

 

Tex understood where I was coming from.  I could see that by the way he nodded at me. It is a hard lesson, but there you go.  Tex leaned over, placed his right hand on my shoulder, and, with the heavy cowboy twang to his voice, said “Thanks fer sharing that with me, Fuck Boy.”  ",1,1747685426.0,Sasquatch_Nazi,0,1.0,False

So, few months ago nag open kami ng physical store sa dulo ng baranggay near a college and our target market is the students there. (Spoiler alert, ni isa wala pa kaming nagiging customer from that school)

For context, we use espresso machine and airconditioned ang space namin with 8 seating capacity. We offer free wifi din sa customers. Tiwala ako sa mga drinks namin na masarap at may mga crafted na wala sa ibang coffee shop lalo sa competensya.

1st month naging maayos and kahit paano okay ang benta. The next month napansin namin na bumaba ng 10k ang benta compared sa una. Doon namin narealize na malayo talaga kami sa densed na area dito sa lugar namin. Maraming dumadaan na sasakyan pero parang mga kabayo na diretso lang ang tingin ng mga sakay/driver

Ngayon, biglang may nag bukas na 59ers na kapehan sa gitna ng barrio namin. Mas mataas ang foot traffic doon kaya naman pansinin sila. Mas marami din silang kakilala dahil tubi sila dito di gaya namin na dayo. At since mas mura sila, yung ibang customers namin doon na tumatambay. This month, 1/4 lang ng kita namin nung 1st month ang benta namin. Hindi ko na alam ang gagawin para maka hatak pa ng customers. 

Nag popost kami sa mga groups everyday at nagpa promo na din pero walang pumansin. Nasa food delivery app na din kami pero wala ding napasok na order

Nakakapanghina pero hindi ko afford na isara ang coffee shop. Please help us on how to improve our visibility and marketing

The idea is simple: you read and listen to dialogues, learn new words, and test your knowledge.

Right now, I’m working on two novels.

One follows Emma, a journalism student, and her roommates. Together with Emma, you can meet new people, order a cup of coffee at the café, chat about rumors with friends, go shopping, and much more. I plan to write a full story covering all five years of Emma’s university life to provide enough content for a complete language course. (Though honestly, I’m not sure how I’ll manage it.)

The other novel is *Royal School of Magic*. The main character is an ordinary schoolboy who, due to a random twist of fate, ends up in a prestigious elite school. But something strange is happening there. And it’s not just the magic.

Both novels currently feature voice-acted dialogues, a vocabulary screen for new words, knowledge quizzes, karaoke, and a hidden object mini-game.

  
I'd love to hear your thoughts or suggestions! What features would you find most helpful in a language-learning visual novel?

This is what finally pushed me to consult a professional.

I’ve recently moved to the UK and am anxious about navigating the healthcare system, so I thought I’d think about the things I can do on my own, ie changing my diet and exercise routines. 

For context I am 26, Asian, mostly sedentary as I had an office job before moving here to study but I always make time to walk (I currently avg 10k steps a day). I eat 3-4 times a day where I always try to get carbs protein and fibres in, although the proportions of each may differ on a day to day basis. I have a sweet tooth and love coffee - these are the two things I am most sad about having to cut back on :(

I’d greatly appreciate if anyone could share some tips on how they approached their lifestyle changes. It just seems like a huge step to make and I’m not quite sure where to start. Thanks so much for the help ❤️

April 7th, completed online order to switch from Virgin to Sky due to massive increase from Virgin. Instal date set for April 23rd. 

Midnight, April 22nd, Virgin internet shut off. 

Morning, April 23rd, went downstairs to set up new router and found that the white box needed to instal the stupid thing didn’t exist in the house. Contacted Sky who said that wasn’t possible because they have my house listed as already having fiber hooked up. I send pictures to prove the box doesn’t exist. Guy on the phone schedules an engineer/tech to come out the 24th and fix it. 

April 24th, tech comes out and says he can’t do anything because they put in the wrong information in the order and he can’t do anything without the right order because he works for OpenReach and they have to have the right orders to get paid, okay fair. Call Sky back and explain, they say someone is scheduled to come out again on the 25th now with the correct order. 

April 25th wait almost all day for the tech to come out, text message has it confirmed but no one shows up. Call Sky again to be told “oh that was canceled but I don’t know why”, okay fine schedule it again. 

April 26th a new guy comes out and gets the fiber cable all hooked up, lights are all green but no internet because he says that SKY needs to switch it on now once he sends in the information that the tech side is done. As it was a Saturday, he said it might take till Monday to get it set up but to call them Sunday and check. 

April 27th, call to check and see if it can be turned on, told they have to wait for the techs notes to get to their system. 

April 28th, wait around for a text from the tech to say the internet will be switched on. Finally messages and says everything is set on his end, nothing from Sky. 

April 29th- May 1st suddenly the internet works!!! Woohoo!!!! Problem solved! 

May 2nd, wake up and internet is off. No messages or emails from Sky. Call in and am told “oh someone is going to call you between 4-5pm tonight to talk to you about this”. Okay so no internet again, wait and wait for a call, no call. Call them back and ask WTH. Told they don’t know why no one called and they will put in a “note” for it. 

May 3rd, called again, told they can’t help me because it is set for an “administrator” to call me, wait till Monday. Told them that doesn’t work for me, I work from home and I’ve now been without reliable internet for a week essentially. They go into the account to see that SKY had CANCELED my account without any warning, communication or reason for the cancelation. They say they can get me a NEW installation scheduled but it won’t be till MAY 19th (today). Fine, whatever, honestly so frustrated and stressed at this point I just want the internet to work. 

*side note, at this point I’ve been told twice to “just use a hotspot” to get work done, well that didn’t last and I ended up having to switch phone providers and get a more expensive phone plan in order to just attempt to get emails sorted. I’ve also paid my neighbor £60 to use their internet for a week. 

May 4th-17th I keep calling back to figure out what happened and make sure my internet will be installed. 

May 17th after teaching all day, get a text saying the install for the 19th has been canceled. Again. NO information or reason for this. I call Sky AGAIN to ask and am told oh we can’t help but an administrator will call “soon”. Called again to speak to a different person and get told that an administrator is scheduled to call me May 19th. 

May 18th I gave up and didn’t bother calling because I’m exhausted and PISSED. 

May 19th (today) waited all day for a call, NOTHING. Called and told they can’t do anything. Ask to speak to a manager and told I will be put on hold. I’ve been on hold for over an hour now and I’m pretty sure their offices are now closed. 

I can’t file anything with the ombudsman till May 27th (8 weeks after this all started). They have also told me that I can’t even switch to another broadband provider because they have to be able to “switch” from one company to another so they are holding me over a barrel here. 

My work is suffering as I can only use the WiFi down at the coffee shop for a couple hours a day, my new phone plan seems to have some major issues because I can’t use it for a hotspot because I only have 2bars of service in my house. I am so beyond frustrated with this stupid company and I just want working internet! My job relies on it!!! 

I was told on the 17th that the “earliest we can do a new instal is June 2nd”, which has to be a freaking joke. 

Please, please, please tell me what I can do because I can’t deal with this anymore. 

Oh and I have requested a copy of the file they have on me along with all of their notes (which I believe is my right as the consumer?!) and I’ve never received it. I’ve lost count of how many people have promised to call me back and never do. I’ve also had two people just straight up hang up on me. ",1,1747685091.0,LegalAdviceUK,3,1.0,False

My life seems to be nailed to a certain place. It's a one-way or three-way line, only the location has changed, but the essence is the same: I am becoming more and more robotic.

But this kind of life is not stable. I can't settle down. I always feel like a swaying boat, drifting with the current but unable to find a direction.

When rents were cheap, we moved up to the Boston area and got an apartment in a very walkable area. She didn't even bring her car at all. I absolutely loved living there, everything was so close and convenient and I never had to drive. Socializing was so much easier, and I never realized how much my dislike of driving/parking influenced my decision to not socialize. Her dog absolutely *loved* living in this walkable area, because there were so many places we could walk without having to drive her somewhere

Unfortunately, we ended up getting kind of priced out of the area. Right now we're doing a short stint in El Paso, TX (6 months) and deciding on where to go next. My brother is trying to convince me to move to Southern California, and he tried to convince me there are multiple walkable places. I go there and... walkability there basically means ""you might be able to walk to a coffee shop (driving is still faster and safer)""

The thought of settling down somewhere that's car dependent, no matter how nice, just seems like an enormous downgrade in almost all aspects of life. I'd rather live in a small apartment in a walkable village in Europe than have the biggest mansion in Beverley Hills, that's how big of a downgrade it feels to me. The lifestyle is just fundamentally different and it permeates all parts of life

To my surprise, my gf *from Texas*, said ""I don't know if I can live in a place that's car dependent ever again"". Her angle was that she makes a lot less than me and works in healthcare, and her car is one of her most major expenses. She also hates that in El Paso, there's no easy way to walk the dog other than around some ugly, hot parking lots or putting her in a car (which the dog hates)

I dunno, at times I almost regret having the experience of living somewhere walkable. Every day in places like California I think ""man... if this was walkable, I would like this all so much more"". I look at these oversized parking lots and 6 lane roads and just kinda feel a sense of... disgust. Like this feeling of ""it doesn't have to be like this, it can be *sooooo* much better... do people actually enjoy this? If they lived somewhere walkable, would they see it the same way?""

Now I feel like my options are to either: give up and accept a quality of life I'm not happy with, sacrifice pretty much everything else financially to live somewhere walkable, or leave everything and move to a country where walkability is an option. Between all of those, it feels like I have to give up *a lot* just to have this thing that's fairly simple to me",18,1747685065.0,fuckcars,1,1.0,False
1kqlnfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoddessCafeTerrace/comments/1kqlnfl/the_key_role_of_the_184th_chapter_of_the_manga_in/,The key role of the 184th chapter of the manga in revealing the protagonist's real feelings.,"If there are those in this subreddit who believe in the exclusive choice of the protagonist, but not in this or that activity of the heroines of the manga, as the main criterion for the final heroine, then the 184th chapter of the manga has already given them a complete and final answer. In this chapter, Hayato not only promised his grandmother to indicate his choice of one of the girls, but also quite clearly described this choice to the readers of the manga.

1. Akane Hououji… She was extremely useful in that she taught Hayato how to make coffee properly. Without this skill, he would not have risked opening a cafe again. Hayato directly clarifies that Akane used to be pretty unapproachable, but now she has changed for the better.

2. Shiragiku Ono… Hayato values ​​her as a grandma's last student, and is grateful to her for the fact that her new menu allowed them all to keep the cafe ""afloat"". Hayato directly clarifies that Shiragiku no longer hides her gaze when talking, as she used to.

https://preview.redd.it/4g19r5l9os1f1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7bd65877ae272af32e6947520c09e3857b3992f

3. Riho Tsukishima… Hayato is grateful to her for teaching him how to properly deal with customers and business partners. As a public comment, Hayato suddenly remembers her sleeping position when they first met (Chapter 1 of the manga). This is his current impression of her.

https://preview.redd.it/ax3kxfscos1f1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c6ff236763c096dd8c79cb8539db1abb0f80783

4. Ami Tsuruga… The protagonist is unable to remember anything about her with gratitude, nor publicly comment on his impressions of her. He can only ask her the sacramental question: “You never change, do you…?”

https://preview.redd.it/v801nlifos1f1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe5091d4c7307349b44d27ad0ff0f06b2d450f6c

5. Ouka Makuzawa… Hayato does not mention whether there is anything she has done for him personally that he should be grateful to. However, he highly appreciates her for what she has done not for him personally, but for the prosperity of their cafe. After all, many visitors come to them just to see the Familia uniforms…, which Ouka constantly updates. And with a natural smile on his face, Hayato suddenly offers Ouka to learn how to cook a new dish(es), except for pilaf.

https://preview.redd.it/2stwvzphos1f1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=dda55dd235e5147a12c62161ce90d0df24a26b1e

Basically, it should already be completely clear to the readers of the manga which one of the girls Hayato considers as special and with which of them “he wants to follow along with his selfish whims”. With which of them he wants to continue working in his grandmother’s cafe in the future.

https://preview.redd.it/gu9ub89los1f1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=77ce6c38facc87fb7b90eb6beb4f568e24d40cdc

The final key here is his direct offer to Ouka to learn how to cook something new from the dishes. This is his direct, voiced desire to continue working with her in their common future, not only as a waitress and uniform designer, but also as a cook. Hayato consciously offers this to only her with his full understanding that all the girls will not be able to work part-time in their cafe forever.",3,1747685057.0,GoddessCafeTerrace,0,1.0,False

1kqljd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanvaFly/comments/1kqljd6/just_found_my_new_favorite_typeface_kenyan_coffee/,"Just Found My New Favorite Typeface: Kenyan Coffee Font (Retro, Sharp, Surprisingly Versatile)","If you’re like me and spend *way too much time* scrolling through fonts trying to find one that isn’t just another Helvetica knockoff, **meet** [Kenyan Coffee](https://canvafly.com/kenyan-coffee-font/) — the font that looks like it walked straight out of a 1960s industrial catalog but still feels slick enough for modern UI.

I stumbled across it while working on a branding project for a sustainable coffee startup (go figure), and this font *just clicked*.

Here’s why it’s worth checking out:

# 🔤 What Makes It Stand Out?

* **Seven weights + italics** = serious design flexibility
* **Stencil variant** that actually looks intentional (not like you hacked up a sans serif in Illustrator)
* **Multilingual support**: Latin, Cyrillic, Vietnamese, AND Greek
* **Optimized for screens**: Great readability across devices
* **Free for personal use** — commercial licenses are tiered and surprisingly fair

# 🧠 Designed by Ray Larabie (Typodermic Fonts)

It’s not just some random ""coffee shop"" font. Kenyan Coffee was inspired by mid-century industrial typefaces — think *Futura Black* or *Avant Garde Gothic*, but with a softer, more human curve.

The stencil variant nods to Cold War military labels and retro manufacturing aesthetics — but polished enough for 2025 web design.

# 📱 Why It Works in Modern Design

I've tested it on mobile, desktop, and even packaging mockups. The font adapts beautifully:

* Counter apertures widen on smaller screens
* Letter spacing loosens on narrow viewports
* Italic slant is subtle (12°) for rhythm, not chaos
* Even AA/AAA accessibility is doable at readable sizes

For tech projects, the light weight feels clean and minimal. For heritage brands or artisanal packaging, the stencil version adds just the right amount of grit.

# 🎯 Perfect For:

* UI headers + minimalist CTAs
* Branding that blends nostalgia with polish
* Artisan products + packaging
* Projects with multilingual needs
* Startups needing a distinct identity *without* custom font budgets

# 🤷‍♂️ Less Ideal For:

* Long-form reading (like 800-word blog posts)
* Ultra-minimalist brands that want geometric precision
* Projects that *explicitly* avoid retro/industrial themes

# 💡 Bonus: Font Pairing Tips

Pair with:

* **Avenir Next** for techy vibes
* **Adobe Caslon Pro** for heritage feels
* **Source Sans Pro** for creative but clean layouts

Avoid pairing with other stencil-heavy fonts unless you *want* a design brawl.

# 📦 Where to Get It:

* Free version (personal use) on **DaFont**
* Commercial licensing via **MyFonts** or **FontSpring**
* Webfont (WOFF2) support available too

I wrote up a full deep dive over on [Canvafly](https://canvafly.com/kenyan-coffee-font/) if you're into specs, use cases, accessibility metrics, and pairing strategies.

Anyone else using this font (or something similar)? Would love to see what others are pairing it with or where it’s popping up in the wild.",1,1747684797.0,CanvaFly,0,1.0,False
1kqlj6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1kqlj6n/my_friend_keeps_commenting_on_my_body/,My ‘friend’ keeps commenting on my body,"This is more of a rant than anything but I am just dumbfounded. I was friends with this girl for a few months and ended up moving to Canada in 2022. I wasn’t that upset though because she did a ton of adderall and drank a lot. I have never tried pills and I didn’t drink so i was sober around her all the time and it definitely got exhausting. 
Well she just moved back and it’s been several years and she called me to catch up. I love interior design and she knows this, so she asked if I could help her decorate her apartment and furnish it. I thought a few years have passed, she’s in her 30’s getting out of a bad relationship, I am pregnant and married so maybe she settled down a little. 
We rent a u-haul and start our day at 10 am. The first thing she said to me was “wow you are huge. You don’t even look pregnant, just fat”. I just kind of chuckled and didn’t know what to say other than “I am 5 1/2 months pregnant and more than halfway done”. 
I was walking around all day, ended up driving her over 50+ miles, 10+ stores, 8,000 steps walked, buying stuff with her and furnished basically her entire apartment. I helped her build her tv stand, assemble her couch, and put in 12+ hours of helping her the entire day. I didn’t get home until just before 11 pm. During the 12 hours, she called me fat at least 5 times, told me I eat really fast, told me I have cankles,  called my husband controlling because he told me I needed to wrap it up and come home at 9 pm because he wanted to make sure I got home safe before he went to bed (we live 45 mins away) and she didn’t offer to buy me a $5 coffee to help her all day. She asked me how much I weigh and I told her 134 pounds and she told me she thought I weighed way more. At the end of the day, I told her my feet were hurting so I was going to wait in the car because she was going back to buy something we looked at earlier in the day. She looks at me and goes “makes sense, you’re carrying 50 extra pounds so I’m sure your feet are hurting”. I told my husband about my day when she went in the store and he was livid that I was helping her. Not to sound catty, but another annoying part about this is she has gained 20+ pounds since I’ve seen her and I would NEVER make a comment about it to her, ever. I’m not looking for advice I guess, but just wanted to share how insanely clueless people are when talking to others 🤣 I’m usually not one left speechless, but that entire day I hardly even know what to say.

I’ve always considered the idea of biking to work. When I lived in Hoboken and worked in Manhattan I wished there was a decent way to bike in without going up to the GWB and back down. Then I worked for a company that actually had some interior office space with showers and bike lockers in TriBeCa but I wasn’t sure about commuting from West Orange into NYC for my in office days. But now I work for a company in Jersey City. The road bike route would be 16 miles and easily doable. So I’m curious about the logistics I’d need to consider:

1. What to do with a road bike when I get to the office? I can inquire with building management if there’s anywhere safe to store it. But - what am I missing? I don’t know if I’d be allowed to roll it in through security turnstiles and keep it near my workspace. Or that I’d necessarily want to flaunt my bright orange bike in my cubicle area
2. Clothing? I don’t believe we have showers. But I could probably store some ‘dude wipes’ and deodorant and other provisions somewhere since I’ll keep a regular schedule. 
3. Stuff - I have a Microsoft surface table. I bring a backpack style work bag when I drive. I don’t ’need’ everything I cart with me but I like my reusable water bottle and coffee cup. My wired headset I use for calls. And other minor stuff I bring to work. If I’m cycling - how would I best transport this stuff? 

Here’s what I posted in the general NJ subreddit: 

Anyone bike to Jersey city for their work commute? I’m an experienced road cyclist and I have the route I would take mapped out. But I’ve never commuted via bike. Curious what folks do as far as hauling their work materials (laptop, coffee mug, water bottle, work clothes) and then what could I do with my bike when I arrive at the office?

I found these budget and vendor recaps incredibly helpful when I was planning my wedding, so wanted to share mine in case it helps anyone else. 

We did a small civil ceremony at City Hall (family only) followed by a 100 person reception (vows, dinner, and dancing) at Lolinda SF in the Mission. It was an absolutely perfect celebration!

**VENUE, FOOD, & DRINK: $33K**

Lolinda had a $25K minimum spend + service charge and tax. Our tab ended up about $3K under so consider the difference our “venue fee.”

This included passed appetizers and bubbly at cocktail hour, seated three course dinner with passed wine, and a LOT of drinks ordered by our guests. I can’t say enough good things about the restaurant reception setup - we heard again and again that the food was the best our guests have ever had at a wedding, the cocktails were amazing, and the service was fantastic. We absolutely love Lolinda and go frequently, and still they exceeded our expectations! 

The other great thing about the venue is that it has two bars (upstairs and downstairs), so there was a great flow for our guests. 

**PHOTOGRAPHER: $6K**

We worked with Hannah Leigh and cannot say enough good things about her! Her “editorial meets documentary” style is exactly what we were looking for. We don’t have our wedding photos yet but our engagement photos were stunning. She also knows all the ins and outs of City Hall and made the hectic civil ceremony experience a total breeze!! She is amazing. 

**DJ: $2.5K**

We found DJ Jeremy and his partner Jeannine on this sub and are so happy we did!! The dance floor was a blast and they did an incredible job blending our diverse tastes in music. 

**STRING DUO: $1.3K**

We worked with Musical Heartstrings and had a violinist and cellist duo for the first two hours of the evening. They were amazing and truly elevated the entire experience. 

**HAIR & MAKEUP: $1.6K**

This included hair and makeup for 5 family members (makeup only for one) + bridal hair with Vivian Sampson’s wonderful team. I did my own makeup. 

**DAY OF COORDINATOR: $2K**

We worked with Sidney Phan! We were back and forth on having a day of coordinator but are glad we did - it took all the stress out of the actual event and allowed us to be fully present while vendor coordination / setup / tear down happened behind the scenes. 

**STATIONARY: $800**

This included save the dates, invitations, escort cards, seating cards, and table numbers from Minted. There is always a discount code running! Minted also replaced our invitations for free after the box we dropped them into was vandalized. 

**WEDDING RINGS: $1.7K**

We worked with Yadav for mine and ordered groom’s from Madera. 

**FLORALS: $300**

I had my $100 bouquet made at my favorite SF florist (Roseandthorn) and we spent ~$200 on TJ’s flowers for stem vases and bouquets. For $200 I had more TJ’s flowers than I knew what to do with!

**WEDDING DRESS & TUX: $7K**

I bought my dress from Grace & Ivory in Chicago and had it tailored at Tailor Maid. 

My husband did a custom tux from Suitsupply. 

This also includes accessories (veil, earrings, hairpiece) from Etsy. 

**ADDITIONAL DECOR: $1K**

This included guestbook (had a coffee table book of our engagement photos printed by Mixbook with guests signing in margins), vases, frames, candles, bathroom boxes, card box, etc. 

We also had a bowl of matchbooks as guest favors. 

**OTHER INCIDENTALS: $1.2K**

Vendor tips, marriage license, City Hall ceremony fee, and a camcorder 

**NEXT DAY PICNIC: $1.4K**

We bought burritos from El Buen Sabor and a ton of alcohol and snacks from Costco and Target + got a permit for a park day at GGP.

# Background

32M. This was my second proper HM. Have known that I have a decent predisposition to long distance running but never taken it super seriously. Have run a few races including a big 14k fun run in Sydney, but never broke the 60min barrier (was always 62ish). Never used to properly train for races, except doing more ""runs"". Joined a run club over here and got more into running, but was only doing it once per week. I did run some more HM's with them, and it changed my perception of the distance after an awful first attempt years ago (IBS halfway through, not fun!!). Mid-way through 2024 I did a 5km and clocked in at 20mins flat, which killed me. But wasn't really exercising much and then for the last few months of 2024, wasn't exercising at all. Did a HM in Feb, based off some ""unserious"" training (30ish KM p/w) for 6 weeks prior and did it in 1:34:04. Right around the 4:27 plateau I've always had which made me realise I need to do something different. Decided to give a proper training block a go, and actually asked on here whether I could get down to a 1:25 in 11 weeks. Of course that was immediately noted as extremely ambitious given it was my 5km time, so decided on a goal of 1:28. 

# Training

Immediately after the Feb HM I found this subreddit and started looking at training plans, but was completely overwhelmed (had no idea what temp or threshold was). The big unlock for me came with discussing this with Chatgpt, and it created a hybrid Pfitzinger/Daniels plan which it describes as ""Your training block was a hybrid of Daniels’ structured intensity and Pfitzinger’s aerobic volume, blending tempo runs, VO2 max intervals, and progressive long runs with fast finishes. It focused on building threshold strength and race-specific endurance, rather than pure mileage stacking or excessive speedwork—giving you a well-rounded, efficient base to peak off.""

Chatgpt ended up being fantastic for my training. I got into a flow of sharing my workouts and long run garmin data with it and then discussing the runs. It was able to track my progress with actual data. It was also very helpful midway through the block where I struggled to hit some of the long run, last 5k HM pace finishes that the plan had and was lacking confidence. Eventually I was able to break through, which was an awesome feeling at the time. It was also very helpful to have a much richer understanding of my training and my body, firstly in terms of how a block is supposed to go, and then other things such as exploring HR's and mentally how I approach runs and races. This made the block very enjoyable as I was learning a lot about running and myself throughout, and it got a lot of written and actual data about my running. I am going to continue using it for training moving forward, with me inputting of where I want to go and different training styles. 

Completed all my workouts (I really enjoyed talking them through with chatgpt post workout) and skipped a few easy runs. Mileage peaked around 70km for a week - which is when I started to feel a lot of fatigue. Deloaded the next week, before jumping back into the 60ish range for 3 weeks before a 3 week taper. Was sick a couple of weeks ago and took it very easy in the taper. Apart from the fatigue, had no injuries or nigels affect any of my training.

# Pre-race

Had a big bowl of pasta late afternoon the evening prior. Woke up early and had 2 cream cheese bagels with a few coffees. Stayed at home rather than facing the lines at the race and got the business done. Also had 1L of electrolytes the night before and the morning of. Couple quick strides beforehand and that was it really. 

# Race

Had heard there was some deceptive hills from friends who had done the HH prior and had discussed the plan with Chatgpt in the week prior. Hackney has been pretty hot previously, but was perfect this year (overcast, 12-14 degrees). I really enjoy progression runs, so planned to take it easy until 8km in and then slowly get faster. I decided to pace on HR rather than pace (which I roughly knew anyway), as I knew I would blow up if my HR reached high 160's early. I tend to redline over 170. 

In terms of the race I think I did it pretty textbook. I took water at most of the stations, though felt quite bloated in the back half and was annoyed with the cups, rather than bottles. I felt my pace drop back 20 odd seconds taking water which was annoying + letting it digest into the system. I also took 3 gels at 7km, 14km & 18km. 

I focused on HR for the first half which served me well and was excited to get to the back end to finally see how all this training translated on race day. This went well and my HR peaked in the last 5km with a 171 avg (4:05km avg pace). Had my Adios Pro 4's on which were great. Mid-way through the race what I really liked was switching my garmin to the lap time, and just focusing on bringing that lap pace down each KM. From 14-20km I pretty much forgot about the total distance and was only focused on the getting the lap KM time down to my target which was great. Felt very much like I was pacing myself, vs using other people. Ended up with a good clean negative split across each 5km.

Really fun race and the support is fantastic! Felt like a champ running near London Fields, where the support was deep. 

# Post-race & Reflections

Many a beer was consumed and my running club mates smashed some PB's which was great. It's an awesome day out and I really recommend to go either as a runner or a supporter. 

  
If you can't already tell, ChatGPT was a fantastic resource and I was really happy with my progress. I am definitely doing a marathon but going to do one next year and continue getting quicker this year. Always been a life goal to do a sub 3hr marathon, which I definitely know I'm capable of. Keen to see how some more blocks add to my base speed and hopefully do a sub 3 on my first attempt which would make me super proud. In terms of training for the rest of the year, I've seen this Norweigan Singles Method discussed on here. And so I've been talking it through with ChatGPT and going to give that a go and see how I get on with some 10k and HM races this year.

First off, I'm used to drinking 2 or 3 energy drinks a day (200-300mg each), I brew death wish espresso coffee in an espresso maker and fill up a 30oz Yeti with it, along with the occasional Dr Pepper and iced teas/hot teas... so not uncommon for me to exceed 1,000 mg of caffeine per day. I usually fall asleep the second my head hits the pillow and usually sleep well. I don't have any anxiety that I'm aware of. I typically have an abundance of energy and I do feel like it kind of calms me. My last caffeine was Wednesday, 5/14 around noon. I decided to quit cold turkey. No withdrawal symptoms until 5/16 around 18:00. I was weightlifting in the gym and experienced exertional headaches with each rep. With each rep, the pain kept worsening and caused me to quit my workout early. Headache resolved once I stopped working out. I started experiencing insomnia the evening of 5/16 as a withdrawal symptom. My resting heart rate while on caffeine is usually very consistently 64bpm. On day 2, it was 60 bpm. Day 3: 62. Day 4: 59 bpm and Day 5: 55 bpm! I've had issues with insomnia since Day 2, but what's odd is my Garmin watch shows my body battery charging to 100 the last 2 nights. I've had a Garmin for years and it has never shown my body battery to charge fully ever until now! Plus, my HRV status is higher than ever. Even though Garmin Connect shows I always have a balanced HRV, it's always been a pretty low HRV according to the charts for age/sex, even though I consider myself to be in pretty decent cardiovascular shape. I think it's pretty cool to see what's actually measurable from wearing my watch! The myalgias from my hips to knees  started on day 3 and peaked on day 4... they were almost unbearable and I usually have a really high pain tolerance. The myalgias are finally lessening today (day 5), I find going for a walk helps them. Electrolytes don't seem to help. I'm already noticing a subjective improvement in my skin, especially the backs of my hands where it usually looks crepey. I do find myself craving sugar while going through withdrawals. I normally have no cravings and no desire for sugar. Anyone else have a similar experience and what did you do to reduce sugar cravings?",2,1747684296.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

TLDR : looking for some new friends to play some Tabletop Roleplaying games with, hoping to connect.

——————

Just out here gauging interest for 1–2 potential new players for our tabletop RPG group. I’m hoping this post reaches folks who are genuinely interested in giving it a shot!

A bit about us: We’re all in our late 20s to early 30s, and we have a lot of love and passion for TTRPGs. We’re a laid-back and welcoming group that values inclusivity and open-mindedness. Respect and healthy boundaries are important to us—we know everyone has lives, responsibilities, and relationships outside the table. We use this game to enrich our lives, and we try to keep it fun, collaborative, and meaningful.

Our expectations: We’re looking for individuals who share those values—someone respectful, thoughtful, and open to building connections. We appreciate curiosity, a willingness to learn, and an interest in making new friends.

We know everyone carries some baggage, and that’s human. But we do expect honest, open communication—especially if something is affecting the group dynamic, either in or out of game. We want to be able to support one another and keep the table feeling good for everyone.

We’re not power gamers or “elitists”. We lean heavily toward narrative and world-building, with a big focus on characters, story, and group cohesion.

Who we’re looking for:

Though all are welcome, We’re especially interested in newer or less experienced players—folks who are just starting out or still finding their groove in the hobby. If you’ve always wanted to try Starfinder or Pathfinder but felt intimidated by the rules or the community, we’d love to help you get started.

What we can provide:

A welcoming group of players who care about the game, the world, and the people at the table. We’re invested in collaborative storytelling and aim to create a space where everyone feels encouraged to contribute and have a great time. Whether you’re new to the system or a seasoned player, what matters most to us is how we play together.

Where we’re at currently:

We’re on hiatus right now and using this time to meet and chat with a few potential players. We’d love to set up a casual coffee meet-up or a Discord video call to break the ice and get to know each other a bit before jumping into a game.

Schedule & System:

We typically play 2 times a month, usually on Tuesdays or Wednesdays from 5–6pm to 10–11pm. We’re based in the Richmond/Burnaby area.

We’re planning to start a Starfinder campaign—a sci-fi/fantasy blend—but we’re also open to switching to Pathfinder(a more classic fantasy rpg)  if that’s the group’s preference.

We’re aiming to kick things off around mid-July.

If this sounds like something you’d enjoy, feel free to reach out! We’d love to connect and see if it’s a good fit.",5,1747684253.0,richmondbc,0,0.86,False
1kqlav5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1kqlav5/headaches_in_pregnancy/,Headaches in pregnancy,"My first pregnancy 3 years ago was seamless, perfect, heavenly…I could’ve stayed pregnant forever! 

This time around, I am now 17 weeks, I am SO tired and having borderline debilitating headaches and neck/shoulder tension at least 4-5 times a week, if not daily some weeks. I get around 9 hours of sleep a night and drink 1-1.5 gallons of water a day. I don’t drink coffee but do have one glass of iced tea per day. 

Tylenol helps alleviate the pain but I refuse to take medications daily so I’m left with ice packs and essential oils for topical relief. 

My midwife suggested adding magnesium oxide 400mg daily to help with tension and headaches, I’m only on day 3 so there has been no difference yet. 

I’m curious if anyone has ever been in the same boat as I currently am? Any tips on natural approaches to relief?? 

Also, just for fun, any theories about headaches and gender?? I swear I’m having a boy this time simply because the pregnancy is polar opposite from my pregnancy with my daughter.

Over the time I was there, 10 or so boomers came in and most refused to use the kiosk to order food. The patient worker had to use the same kiosk to order food. 

I can understand technology frustrations,  but AFAIK, these kiosks have been around for a while and are quite easy to use.

I commend the 20% who at least tried to use them as the rest just stood there waiting.

To make make matters  worse, if the food didn’t come out in their preferred time, the boomer would go back to the worker (helping another boomer at the kiosk) and interrupt them with “Where’s my (insert food item here)?”.  The worker would ask “what’s your order #?”. Half of them didn’t know and had somehow already misplaced their receipt.

The cycle repeated itself over and over.

I’m looking for some suggestions for chill night drives in or around Dublin. Ideally something scenic, peaceful, coastal or mountain, either is good.

I’ve done the usual spins around Howth and Phoenix Park, but I’m hoping to discover a few more underrated or lesser-known routes. Bonus points if there are spots where you can pull in safely and enjoy the view or grab a takeaway coffee.

Appreciate any ideas! Thanks in advance.

I’ve been going to it for a few weeks and it’s mostly a musical open mic. Sometimes they’ll let poets go on stage and they say that they’ll let anyone do anything as long as it’s within reason. 

They said I can do stand up. However, I haven’t really seen anyone do stand up. 
I’ve seen dudes being a synth and do an ambient piece, but I haven’t seen a comedian. 

Would it be a gamble to do it? The people seem nice and I’m getting an idea of what jokes I can tell.

I had an idea where Sir Topham, seeing the increasing workload, came up with a design for a 4-4-4 tender engine to help with these loads. But, the railway board denied the funding after the failure of the Coffee Pots.

I chose a 4-4-4 configuration because there wasn't a tender engine of that configuration on a British Railway so it fits Sir Topham's ""out of the box"" design ideas if he made a tender engine of that design.",3,1747683949.0,thomasthetankengine,0,1.0,False

1kql5b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/intotheradius/comments/1kql5b8/just_crossed_30_hours_on_013_and_here_are_my/,Just crossed 30 hours on 0.13 and here are my thoughts,"First and foremost, I can NOT stop playing this game.  I have (as stated in title) just crossed 30 hours, and that's after wiping two previous save files with almost all guns bought.  The level of immersion is unparalleled in today's gaming world.  I really AM John Radius, chain smoking cigs and getting pinballed between reflector anomalies.

  
The GREAT:

  
1. Weapon variety is really nice, I do think that the shop layout is also more conducive to the player recognizing the differences in calibers (ITR 1 didn't really highlight the differences as much but that's only how they were displayed

  
2. Enemies are SUPER interesting.  I love the designs for this game and am really looking forward to new monsters.  The fragments are REALLY creepy and I love how they move.  The other mimics are fun in their design as well as now I can shoot their limbs off.  Really satisfying to headshot them now.

  
3. Variety in locations - The Outskirts, Forest, and Peninsula all feel unique and different from each other.  I really like how the Peninsula is 'artificially' challenging due to the fog, as you can't see enemies from that far away.  There aren't a lot, but it still feels like they could pop out at any moment.  The Forest is always a great time, and the Outskirts has enough in it that you can't clear the entire thing in one go before the Tide (unless you're really dedicated, but I thought I was and I cannot do it).

  
4. The 'stakes' are higher in the Outskirts now with no easy way to get there.  I found myself spending an entire play session hauling ammo, plates, food, and backpacks to the different safehouses in the Outskirts.  I can last multiple Tides there now, but it feels so isolated and that vibe is incredible.

  
5. The CUBE is so freaking cool.  I love assaulting a building from the outside while the cube is bearing down on my position.  I also have enemies spawned at max level, so I really need to work to get inside when it's coming.  The added layer of pressure is really, really satisfying when you get out.

  
6. Anomaly fields are really fun and more dynamic than ITR 1; ITR 1 was basically just run around these obstacles.  They are still that, but the locations where you're collecting the artifacts are more vertical and 'parkour' oriented, it seems.





The things I want to see improved:

  
1.  For the love of all that is holy, remove the ""ENGAGING"" voice line, I teach middle school and it feels like a 6th grader yelling at me. 

  
2.  The Fragments should pursue me throughout the entire apartment buildings.  I remember shooting one from a window high up and missing.  It vanished from view and I kept looking over my shoulder to see if it was creeping into the building.  Sadly, it was not.  I want that to happen, it happens in the Forest to me all the time (well, more than it should happen because I don't slow down, I AM John Radius)

  
3.  Distortion Headgear - this stuff gets damaged slightly and loses 120 seconds of function?  I don't get how these are supposed to work and I avoid all distortion zones now.  I also feel like there isn't enough incentive to enter them, as the artifacts seem to still be random (not more valuable), and there is around the same number as there are in normal anomaly fields.  Especially if I'm deep in the Outskirts, the headgear stays in the safehouse.  I like the zones, but the gear we need is confusing

  
4.  Enemies spawning in walls - self explanatory.  I think this has a lot to do with the fact that I have enemies spawning at max and there's 'less' places to put them.

  
5. 'Samey' architecture - this wasn't even something that I was bothered by until I was streaming this for two of my friends and one specifically told me that they're turned off by the re-used buildings and assets.  I am not bothered by it, but now it's all I see.  Not sure how to fix/improve/change this, but it's still an observation.  My buddy said he was on the fence about the game and that was a factor.

  
6.  Give me loot that's more than just weird objects!  I LOVED finding the sample containers, weather tools, confidential documents, and other things.  Give me more of that.  I do enjoy the current loot, but it made me feel more like an explorer/scientist rather than just a radius hunter/killer.  



7.  On the same note, I want more clutter for our bases.  I have collected all of the coffee mugs and I want more stuff to pick up and bring back.  The white objects from ITR1 were fun to find and bring back to display; I want more stuff like that.

  
8. I'd also love a way to swap backpacks without using a stand.  I had a bag loaded to the top with artifacts and loot and thought I could just fling it over my shoulder with the other in my hand.  I was in the middle of running back.  I kept my main bag in my hand and got back to base to realize I had just dropped the loot backpack in the middle of the Outskirts.

  
9. Trash cans in the outskirts would be cool too, I make a lot of garbage living out in the 'skirts.

Our office bathroom tap can run hot. I've done it. I do it. But every single time I go in there after someone else, it's left on full cold. Not lukewarm. And not centered on neutral. North pole, penguins cold.

And the place always smells bad. Not just post-lunch tragic. Consistently bad. Like someone's on the clock just to take dumps that shifts out the good air that dared and had the nerve to flow back in. I swear, there is always someone taking a shit when I walk in.

So I know these mofos should be washing up. But no one washes with warm water. These people will microwave their milk for coffee three times a morning but draw the line at warm hand hygiene.

I even brought in my own hand soap. Almond milk and vanilla, with a fancy pump, leaves hands feeling like velvet. No one uses it. It sits there next to the crusty hand sanitizer from the post-covid era, untouched, unloved. They all keep going for the corporate-issued sludge, that smells like a diluted floor cleaner, instead.

At first I thought maybe it was just a coincidence, but then I started testing it. I warm it up, rinse my hands, and leave it on neutral. And sure enough, next time I come back, tap is flipped straight to full blue.

Maybe this is what divides us in the end. It's not even about germs anymore. It'a about principle. Some people quietly rinse with cold water and call it hygiene. This is the culture war they're not talking about",1,1747683724.0,redscarepod,3,0.67,False

By seven he took his shower as cold as it could be to stimulate his brain and make him more energised.
Afther his brakefast while eating his was sheking his mail. Usualy he got six. Letter between bills and paycheck.that's why he threw them across the table to not ruin his mood with extra calculations...
As the letters reached a distant from him. He noticed an unusual thing, a letter plus the regular number. Curiously he picked it up with a feeling of uneasiness that this one might ruin the rest of his day. The letter had nothing written on it.
Shoked at this sight. A faint idea crossed his mind this might be mike his prankster freind who always photographs him in weirdley situantions. Like the last time when he was puking on the toilet after anC few rounds of heavy drinking in ""the golden Clam"" Their Usual Hanging Spot.
This idea Was quickly washed away from his mind along with the brief smile it drew on his face. The latter contained nothing but a few lines. It read:
                'Meet me where the sun
                 first touches the earth'
Those lines had no memories attached to them in Jak's mind and he had no time for them as his phone's alarm started ringing declaring its time for him to get out or he wont be able to catch the bus to his work.
He crumbled the letter and threw it aiming for the bin just for it to miss the target by a few inches. No time to complain about the missed goal right there.duty calls.
Soon as he put foot on the office floor the usual black cloud of self hatred and death wishes hovered over him and to block it off he directly headed toward the coffee machine to consume his daily dose, one that kept him going throughout the day.
He was an accountant for a paper company although if you return to the past and ask him what he would want to be in the future he would have answered that he would like to be a great rockstar like 'kurt cobain' Or 'hendrix' but that dream was shattered that hard after he was kicked out of his home at age 18 just afther his graduation day.
As soon as he sat on his desk obrey the woman infront if him smiled at him wile sying good morning with her gentle voice. Evrybody in the office knew that they would  one day be a couple but that idea seemed to make no impact in jak's mind.
Morinig obrey how was the weekend he said with his casual gostley voice.
Usual she replied movie night sturday and shopping sunday how about you.
Noting intresting really. As he piked the pile of documents infront of him and started filling trought them.
Movie night huh! What did you watch?
Some scary movie the girls recomended. Although i stoped halfway cause i couldn't bare the violence in it.
Hehe! He grinned. She looked at him as he was smilling and smiled back astonished by his reaction. It was a long time that she didn't see hime smile at something she said made a certain comfort in her heart a worm feeling that's hard to explain in words.
The conversation continued between them for about two minutes. It was almost like a daily retualy ro do for both of them , and for jak it was on of the good rhings he liked about his job. Besides the paysheck and the smoking breakes that he was rooting to go to and from time to time ho would take a glance at the clock hopping that the time goes fast so that he could brush of the pilled stress over his shoulders.
The brakes where planned by him and the other coworkers where they would take brakes in groupes of two while others covered over them. They all knew it was illigal to leave your post in duty let alone smoking at work but they knoew if they didn'y do it they woul break by the end of the day and by the end of the month they would reseign or worst take their own lifes for the wrong choices they made as youngsters.
There were times when rounds of beer got involved but that heppened usually when tings got out of hand at the office and phones wouldn't stop ringing.
But that is not the case for today, It was A Regular Monday Morning A ""Boring One"" One Might say only if he didn't knew that the job it self was eating the workers day by day especially jak who started his countdown as his arms started shaking and his forehead poring sweat "" 9,,,8,,,7,,,6,,,5,,,4..."" As it got closer and closer jack could hear his heart pounding on his shest almost like a heart attack.
Finally its time jak received a message trough the ""smokies"" chat group in the office a faint smile was drawn on his face after reading it realising that his was so deep into the rabbit hole that his is officially stamped an addict. A thought he quickly brushed from his mind and proceeded like some ninja without attracting any attention to head toward the bathroom hall where he would slide by the staff door into the back exite light a guitar waiting for his partner in crime ""Rita"" the hotshot girl at the offic e who has had enough of this job along time ago even befor jack joined in.

1. Is it easy for transplants who do not have kids in the school system to meet people and form friendships? Asked another way, is Wauwatosa a town where residents largely hang with the people they grew up with or do they tend to be open to socializing with new arrivals?

1kql15y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kql15y/b3trvechain_carbon_credits_rwa_opportunities/,B3TR/Vechain- Carbon Credits - RWA opportunities through global adoption,"I’d like to start off by saying that I have no affiliation with Vechain official, and can’t actually tell if this is their strategy, or was their intent. However, if it isn’t, they should definitely reach out to me, and give me a reward for being a genius.

So, let’s dive into it.

The VeBetterDao platform offers a plethora of opportunities. It also showcases Vechain as a L1 platform, and in my opinion, takes a more serious approach to what real, scalable adoption, looks like. It’s not memecoins and rugpulls, but tangible evidence that blockchain offers credible solutions that are impossible to create elsewhere. 

In alignment with their original company ethical values, the primary focus here is environmentally conscious RWA, made simple, profitable, and interesting.

Whenever Vechain issues B3tr, it costs them next to nothing. In return, the user must perform tangible actions, that mitigates their carbon footprint.

**An example from earlier today, is Bubbles:**

Bubbles has a max limit of 5 actions per day, for the sake of this discussion, we’ll use all of them. This means that a user may have 1825 actions per year, reducing their carbon footprint by 0.82kg CO2e per action - the assumption here is that the user would have used a plastic bottle as the alternative. Which, for the sake of the sale of carbon credits, is good enough. We’ll come back to that later.

A user can then generate 1.496 metric tonnes of carbon credits (CC) per annum.

Scale this up to half of the Vechain sub, and you’re looking at:

1.496m3 * 111700 =167 103,2 m³

These CC are valued at €70.39 (may 19 2025) per m3.

**The value created, just through Bubbles the dApp, then becomes: 167103.2 * €70.39 =€11 762 394,25**

What then about the other dApps.

An average tumbler has a carbon footprint (CF) of 1.8kg CO2e per use.

HangNDry now offers a profitable alternative. Rather than spend electricity on drying your clothes in a tumbler, you can now earn money on top of it, by being environmentally friendly.

The median is about 120 tumbler uses per year, per person. Let’s use the same numbers again, and we’re looking at 120 * 1.8kg CO2e = 216kg CC created per user. 0.216m3 * 111700 =24 127,2 m³ —> 24127.2 * €70.39 =€1 698 313,61

It all adds up, and it has an absolutely astounding revenue potential, that costs almost nothing.

In comparison, other companies are making big moves in selling CC’s, but there’s just not enough to go around, and no one has been able to truly tap into the consumer market. Because if you as a company sell less papercups or styrofoam cups with coffee, you’re losing revenue.

Tesla has had the sale of CCs as one of their largest revenue streams for years, and has been able to negate some of their worse losses because of a high OPEX.

Vechain can with a swift adoption rate, become the most used blockchain in the world, as well as secure a significant revenue stream, simply by making it interesting for the consumer to think about the environment.

The implications of the scale up of VeBetterDao are huge, and gives Vechain the possibility to initiate in industrial symbiosis projects, where CCs are the main pipeline, but can be built upon to sell supplychain and tracking solutions as well.

If they do it well, they can let companies build apps that enables the consumer to earn, save, (feel good about being environmentally friendly?) and interact with their go-to producers, as well as partake in the revenue generated by CCs. Vechain can then sit back, and collect basically royalties from this work.

I doubt it’s gonna be alot, but at current prices, I think a regular household, with 2+ users, can generate around $2-3000 per year.

For some, that will be negligible, for others, life changing.

What I find the most interesting, is the gaming aspect of it all. Using the apps becomes almost an obsession once you start. Since it’s all convoluted, yet intuitive, it requires near to no knowledge or experience navigating the software/app.

I’ll easily reccomend people download the VeWorld wallet, buy $1 worth of VTHO, and start using the various dApps available on it. 

In addition to being able to vote for the apps you yourself think deserve a larger issuance of the pool, you can also stake your B3TR and simply collect additional rewards. 

We’re all spending so much time on tribalism and nagging about blockchain being a solution looking for a problem. Vechain, with their ability to sell CarbonCredits, gives the people in this space, regardless of which blockchain you want to succeed, the direct ability to actually use the technology on a daily basis. 

Even if you don’t have a horse in this race, you can start earning, simply by doing. You don’t need to own Vechain, you don’t need to root for them as a company, or even believe in them. You get to try it out, basically for free, and start earning based on things a lot of us are allready doing. 

I challenge all /r/cryptocurrency users to try it out, and give concrete feedback on what you think should be different, what works, what’s awesome, and make some money in the process. 

Seeing how this sub went bananas over moons,  the VeBetterDao is exactly what most of you have been looking for! ",3,1747683586.0,CryptoCurrency,0,0.8,False

I won't list everything, but I've done the prescription shampoos, Dermazen, prose, OTC shampoos, MTC, showering daily, showering less/more ... You get the idea. I primarily have scalp issues that can be VERY itchy and isn't helped by my stimming picking behavior. Started in college, now I'm in my mid 30s. That said, it's never been over the top so I sort of just suck it up and stopped wearing black like 8 years ago.

Last year I was pregnant and, as expected, had great skin and my scalp was pretty normal. I did the usual stuff: quit full-caf coffee, quit drinking, took pre-natal vitamins. Attributed a lot of the improvements to hormone/immune shifts. 

My normal coffee intake is ~5 cups a day. I love coffee. I have quit before and just missed the ritual of a hot beverage all morning. 

Now I'm 5mo post partum and dealing with my scalp and acne coming back. Still it drinking alcohol, but back to my regular coffee intake. 

3 days ago I went back to decaf, mostly as an experience to see if it would help my hormonal acne. Some podcast guest finally said that caffeine and estrogen get processed through the same receptor [paraphrasing]?? News to me! This was a big a-ha moment, so I decided to give decaf a try again. 

My scalp has been less itchy, less noticeable, and wihth fewer flakes. WHAT. 

NOTE I did not really limit my sugar intake that much during pregnancy and still haven't changed patterns there.

Has caffeine really been it the entire time? Maybe I've been in denial, maybe it's too soon to call. But my caffeine intake has always fluctuated, and so has the seb derm. There were always other things going on (less stress, outdoor time, shower schedules) that I attributed it to. Now I'm seeing that a ton of people had this experience on this subreddit.

Michigan's first Scenic Highway, M-25, established in 1940, became a symbol of mid-20th-century family road trips, featuring cozy cabin courts providing affordable lodging and local hospitality, enhancing the adventure of exploring the Thumb region. \
These Port Austin's roadside cabins offered families a budget-friendly place to rest, relax, and reconnect during the golden age of highway travel from the 1930s–60s. It also served to jumpstart the emerging tourist economy of the Upper Thumb during the Great Depression. \
\
Cruising Michigan’s First Scenic Highway\
\
Imagine it’s the late 1930s, and you’re motoring along a freshly paved highway at the top of Michigan’s Thumb. The road you’re on is M-25 – officially designated in 1940 as Michigan’s first Scenic Highway. This two-lane ribbon hugs the Lake Huron shore, treating you to glimpses of sandy beaches, towering hardwood forests, and the glittering blue water on the horizon. The nation is coming out of the Great Depression, and families are slowly hitting the road again. By 1940, local boosters proudly noted that “every accommodation for the tourist” lined this scenic route – “good hotels, restaurants, cottages, cabins, free camping grounds” – everything a road-tripper could need. In those days, signs along M-25 beckoned with promises of “Eat”, “Gas”, and “Cabins”, forming a lifeline of services around the Thumb.\
\
\
As you drive into the village of Port Austin at the tip of the Thumb, you feel a cool lakeshore breeze. You might be coming from the city on a summer escape, eager to see local attractions like the strange rock formation known as Turnip Rock or to camp by the ruins of old Port Crescent in the new state park. The car is loaded with kids, fishing poles, and picnic baskets – a classic mid-century family road trip. After a long day’s drive, everyone’s looking forward to a friendly place to spend the night. Fortunately, Port Austin in the 1930s–1960s is dotted with mom-and-pop cabin courts ready to welcome travelers. \
\
This was the golden age of automobile tourism, and local folks all along M-25 were turning their homes and farmland into informal resorts to cater to the motoring public. By the 1950s, postwar vacationers packing into their Chevys and Fords were exactly the kind of guests these family-run cottages and motor courts were built to serve. The stage is set: twilight is coming on, and the “Cabins – Vacancy” light is flickering on. Let’s pull over and explore some of Port Austin’s early roadside cabin stops.\
\
Port Austin's Roadside Cabins Resorts\
\
Bay Crest Cabins on US 25\
\
 Bay Crest Cabins was one of the quaint cabin clusters awaiting travelers on the outskirts of Port Austin. Tucked beneath big shade trees along what was then US-25, Bay Crest featured a handful of tidy little cabins set back from the road. On a warm evening you might find a family at the picnic table out front, unpacking a supper or playing cards in the dappled light filtering through the maples. Their car would be parked just steps from the cabin door – the ultimate convenience for weary motorists. \
\
The cabins themselves were humble one-room structures with simple wood siding, but they provided all the essentials: a dry roof, a clean bed, and a bit of privacy in the northwoods air. Bay Crest Cabins exemplified the mid-20th-century trend of affordable roadside lodging that let middle-class families explore Michigan’s Thumb without breaking the bank. It was a shady, peaceful retreat where the sounds of crickets and Lake Huron’s breeze lulled travelers to sleep after a long day on the road.\
\
Lakeside Motor Sales Cabins and Cottages\
\
 Lakeside Motor Sales Cabins and Cottages offered a more bustling stop right in Port Austin’s village – a true one-stop shop for travelers. Owned by local entrepreneur Ed Parks, who ran the Sinclair gas station and an auto sales business on site, Lakeside Motor Sales combined fuel, service, and lodging in one place. Picture pulling into a gleaming white Sinclair station with vintage “HC” globed gas pumps out front and a big Sinclair dinosaur sign by the curb. While an attendant topped off your tank and cleaned the windshield, you could stroll a few yards over to check into a cozy cabin for the night. A prominent sign on the lawn proclaimed “Lakeside Motor Sales – CABINS – Heated – Showers”, advertising modern comforts that not every roadside cabin could boast in the 1930s. \
\
\
\
Scattered around the neat grassy court were a handful of small white cottages, each with green trim and a little screened porch. Adirondack chairs sat under young shade trees for guests to relax in the evening. Footpaths connected the cabins to the station and an office, making it feel like a miniature tourist village. Here a family could refuel both the car and themselves – perhaps grabbing a cold pop or ice cream from the station’s store – then settle into a clean, heated cabin with an indoor shower (a true luxury in the early days of motor travel!). Lakeside Motor Sales Cabins was the kind of place where the neon lights of the gas pumps and the warm glow from cabin windows created a reassuring oasis for 1940s travelers rolling into town after dark.\
\
\
\
 Horse Shoe Park Cabins brought a touch of Victorian charm to the roadside cabin scene. This property featured a grand old farmhouse-style home at its center – complete with gables, a wraparound porch, and ornate woodwork – which served as the owners’ residence and perhaps an office for guests. The name “Horse Shoe Park” likely came from the layout of its cabins: a semi-circle arrangement arcing around the big yard like a horseshoe. In the front lawn, a hand-painted sign reading “Horse Shoe Park Cabins” greeted arrivals, and just beyond it, you could see a row of small cottages nestled amid lilac bushes and birch trees. \
\
This early 1940s photo shows three or four of these cabins lined up beside the main house, each with a tidy stoop and a peaked roof, looking like tiny versions of the family home itself. Guests who stayed here often felt more like houseguests than anonymous travelers – the proprietors might be sitting in rocking chairs on that big front porch ready to chat, and kids could play on the grass under the willow tree. In the evening, the porch light and a couple of yard lamps would illuminate the path to your cabin. Horse Shoe Park Cabins captured the homier side of tourism: a blend of bed-and-breakfast warmth and cabin-court simplicity, all under the care of a local family.\
\
\
\
 Just down the road, an establishment known as Thompson and Long Cottages offered a decidedly rustic ambiance. In fact, locals sometimes just called it “Long’s Log Cabins,” and one look at the place made it obvious why. The cabins here were built in a rough-hewn log style – sturdy little shacks with vertical log slab siding and screened front porches that made each unit look like a pioneer’s cottage. A surviving real-photo postcard proudly titles the scene “The Thompson and Long Cottages, Port Austin, Mich.”, showing a cluster of these log cabins arranged on a dirt clearing. In that image, you can almost taste the dust from the gravel road and hear the creak of the porch screen door. \
\
This wasn’t fancy lodging by any stretch: the floors might be wooden or even just painted planks, and the furnishings likely minimal. But for many travelers in the 1940s, a night at Thompson & Long’s cabins was about adventure and authenticity. You could park your car right in front of your cabin, unload the fishing gear, and feel like you were “roughing it” in the north woods (with a few basic amenities, of course). Come nighttime, guests might light up a shared fire pit or charcoal grill out front, swap stories, and roast marshmallows under the stars. The rustic vibe of Thompson and Long Cottages gave city folks a little taste of the simpler life – a throwback even then – which was a big part of the era’s vacation culture.\
\
\
\
 On a slight rise near town stood Wagners Hilltop Cabins, a cozy motor court that literally and figuratively rose above the others. Perched just beyond the main village, Wagner’s had a handful of plain white cabins spaced around a grassy yard. In the center of the grounds was a tall pole mounted with a light or sign, rising high like a beacon. At night, that light would have been visible from down the road, guiding road-weary drivers up to the “hilltop.” \
\
The cabins themselves were unassuming—simple clapboard structures with a single door and window—but they offered a quiet retreat set back from the highway. Being on a hill, a traveler might catch a view of the surrounding countryside or even a distant glimpse of Lake Huron’s horizon from here. One traveler in the 1950s might recall pulling into Wagner’s Hilltop after sunset: the proprietor (The Wagner's, presumably) would come out of the brick office building to check you in, and you’d park beside your little cabin under the glow of that tall yard light. In the morning, the rise provided a lovely vantage to see the sun peeking over the treetops and hear birds singing. Wagner’s Hilltop Cabins offered a tranquil, slightly elevated rest stop, giving families a sense of being tucked away in their own corner of Port Austin for the night.\
\
\
\
 Heading west out of Port Austin on M-25, the road grows quieter and trees thicker. There you’d come across the Port Crescent Bar Cabins, a unique combination of roadhouse and overnight lodging. The Port Crescent Bar itself was a single-story tavern with a false-front façade and an awning – the kind of place where neon beer signs buzzed in the window and a couple of motorcycles might be parked out front on any given afternoon. \
\
It took its name from the nearby ghost town of Port Crescent, a once-thriving lumber port that vanished in the 1880s. (In fact, an enormous 125-foot brick chimney, left from the old sawmill, still stood as a lonely sentinel behind the trees, giving travelers something to gawk at.) Beside the bar, you would see a few white cabins peeking out from the woods. They were available for rent, making the establishment a perfect all-in-one pit stop: you could grab a hot meal and a cold drink at the bar, swap stories with locals or other travelers, then walk a few steps over to your cabin when it was time to turn in. \
\
The cabins at Port Crescent Bar were basic but convenient – each with a small porch and set a little apart for privacy. Imagine a couple on their honeymoon road trip in the 1950s, dancing to jukebox tunes in the tavern earlier, now retiring to a little cabin where the distant sound of lake waves mixes with the chirp of crickets. It was this mix of roadside merriment and easy lodging that made Port Crescent Bar Cabins a memorable stopover. You weren’t just spending a night; you were experiencing a sliver of Thumb culture – where hospitality, a bit of local history, and a good time all met on the side of M-25.\
\
\
\
 Finally, near the water’s edge was Saginaw Bay Court, often one of the last Thumb motor courts travelers would encounter heading south or one of the first when coming up from the Bay City side. Saginaw Bay Court was a string of humble cabins right along the shoreline, offering an incredible proximity to the lake. An old photograph shows a row of weathered wooden cabins with cars parked practically at the doors, and just beyond them, the open expanse of Saginaw Bay gleaming under the sky. \
\
Staying here meant you could fall asleep to the gentle sound of waves lapping the shore and wake up to a brilliant sunrise over the water. The cabins were small and rustic, likely constructed of plain boards and perhaps unpainted or stained dark by the elements, but they had character. Each had a little stoop and maybe a bench outside, so you could sit with a cup of coffee in the morning, watching gulls and fishing boats out on the bay. Families often spent a week here in the 1950s, using it as a base for fishing excursions or beach days – essentially an early form of the “lake cottage” vacation. \
\
\
\
The lake breeze kept things cool even in July, and the kids could run straight from the cabin to the beach to splash in the water. Saginaw Bay Court encapsulated everything appealing about lakeshore travel in that era: simplicity, natural beauty, and the freedom to step out your door onto sand. For many travelers, these little bayside cabins were the ultimate reward after navigating miles of open road.\
\
The Legacy of Port Austin’s Motor Courts\
\
\
\
In the three decades from the 1930s through the 1960s, places like Port Austin showed countless Americans what road-trip freedom was all about. The roadside cabins and motor courts of that era reflected a vacation culture that was casual, adventurous, and family-oriented. Parents, kids, and even the family dog could pile into the car and drive until they found a welcoming sign that said “Cabins” – no reservations needed, just a friendly wave from a proprietor who likely lived right on the property. \
\
These cabin clusters were more than just lodgings; they were experiences in themselves. Travelers remember the neon signs humming at dusk, the smell of campfire smoke mixed with lake air, and the eclectic sights – from gas pumps and diner neon, to clotheslines behind cabins fluttering with beach towels. Each motor court had its own personality: some offered modern amenities like hot showers and electricity, others provided a nostalgic rustic charm that made you feel closer to the land. All of them, however, played a key role as stopovers for families exploring Michigan’s Thumb, stitching together the journey with memories of simple pleasures.\
\
Burnt Cabin Pointe - Eagle Bay\
\
By the late 1960s, the era of the classic tourist cabin was beginning to fade – new interstate highways and bigger chain motels started drawing travelers away from the old two-lanes. Many of Port Austin’s beloved cabin courts either closed, modernized, or were repurposed over time Yet, the legacy of those early tourism days lives on. Next time you cruise M-25 around the Thumb, imagine it 60 or 70 years ago: cars with wood-paneled sides and license plates from all over, winding along the lake, discovering these little oases of hospitality at each bend. \
\
Port Austin’s early roadside cabins helped define an age when the journey was just as exciting as the destination – a friendly cabin under the pines at day’s end being the perfect finish to a long day’s drive. And in today’s Port Austin, if you listen closely, you might still hear echoes of those times in the laughter around a beach bonfire or the quiet goodnight between travelers as they turn in, dreaming of another sunny road ahead.\

It was a shady, peaceful retreat where the sounds of crickets and Lake Huron’s breeze lulled travelers to sleep after a long day on the road.\

Lakeside Motor Sales Cabins and Cottages\
\
 Lakeside Motor Sales Cabins and Cottages offered a more bustling stop right in Port Austin’s village – a true one-stop shop for travelers. Owned by local entrepreneur Ed Parks, who ran the Sinclair gas station and an auto sales business on site, Lakeside Motor Sales combined fuel, service, and lodging in one place. Picture pulling into a gleaming white Sinclair station with vintage “HC” globed gas pumps out front and a big Sinclair dinosaur sign by the curb. While an attendant topped off your tank and cleaned the windshield, you could stroll a few yards over to check into a cozy cabin for the night. A prominent sign on the lawn proclaimed “Lakeside Motor Sales – CABINS – Heated – Showers”, advertising modern comforts that not every roadside cabin could boast in the 1930s. \
\
\
\
Scattered around the neat grassy court were a handful of small white cottages, each with green trim and a little screened porch. Adirondack chairs sat under young shade trees for guests to relax in the evening. Footpaths connected the cabins to the station and an office, making it feel like a miniature tourist village. Here a family could refuel both the car and themselves – perhaps grabbing a cold pop or ice cream from the station’s store – then settle into a clean, heated cabin with an indoor shower (a true luxury in the early days of motor travel!). Lakeside Motor Sales Cabins was the kind of place where the neon lights of the gas pumps and the warm glow from cabin windows created a reassuring oasis for 1940s travelers rolling into town after dark.\
\
\
\
 Horse Shoe Park Cabins brought a touch of Victorian charm to the roadside cabin scene. This property featured a grand old farmhouse-style home at its center – complete with gables, a wraparound porch, and ornate woodwork – which served as the owners’ residence and perhaps an office for guests. The name “Horse Shoe Park” likely came from the layout of its cabins: a semi-circle arrangement arcing around the big yard like a horseshoe. In the front lawn, a hand-painted sign reading “Horse Shoe Park Cabins” greeted arrivals, and just beyond it, you could see a row of small cottages nestled amid lilac bushes and birch trees. \
\
This early 1940s photo shows three or four of these cabins lined up beside the main house, each with a tidy stoop and a peaked roof, looking like tiny versions of the family home itself. Guests who stayed here often felt more like houseguests than anonymous travelers – the proprietors might be sitting in rocking chairs on that big front porch ready to chat, and kids could play on the grass under the willow tree. In the evening, the porch light and a couple of yard lamps would illuminate the path to your cabin. Horse Shoe Park Cabins captured the homier side of tourism: a blend of bed-and-breakfast warmth and cabin-court simplicity, all under the care of a local family.\
\
\
\
 Just down the road, an establishment known as Thompson and Long Cottages offered a decidedly rustic ambiance. In fact, locals sometimes just called it “Long’s Log Cabins,” and one look at the place made it obvious why. The cabins here were built in a rough-hewn log style – sturdy little shacks with vertical log slab siding and screened front porches that made each unit look like a pioneer’s cottage. A surviving real-photo postcard proudly titles the scene “The Thompson and Long Cottages, Port Austin, Mich.”, showing a cluster of these log cabins arranged on a dirt clearing. In that image, you can almost taste the dust from the gravel road and hear the creak of the porch screen door. \
\
This wasn’t fancy lodging by any stretch: the floors might be wooden or even just painted planks, and the furnishings likely minimal. But for many travelers in the 1940s, a night at Thompson & Long’s cabins was about adventure and authenticity. You could park your car right in front of your cabin, unload the fishing gear, and feel like you were “roughing it” in the north woods (with a few basic amenities, of course). Come nighttime, guests might light up a shared fire pit or charcoal grill out front, swap stories, and roast marshmallows under the stars. The rustic vibe of Thompson and Long Cottages gave city folks a little taste of the simpler life – a throwback even then – which was a big part of the era’s vacation culture.\
\
\
\
 On a slight rise near town stood Wagners Hilltop Cabins, a cozy motor court that literally and figuratively rose above the others. Perched just beyond the main village, Wagner’s had a handful of plain white cabins spaced around a grassy yard. In the center of the grounds was a tall pole mounted with a light or sign, rising high like a beacon. At night, that light would have been visible from down the road, guiding road-weary drivers up to the “hilltop.” \
\
The cabins themselves were unassuming—simple clapboard structures with a single door and window—but they offered a quiet retreat set back from the highway. Being on a hill, a traveler might catch a view of the surrounding countryside or even a distant glimpse of Lake Huron’s horizon from here. One traveler in the 1950s might recall pulling into Wagner’s Hilltop after sunset: the proprietor (The Wagner's, presumably) would come out of the brick office building to check you in, and you’d park beside your little cabin under the glow of that tall yard light. In the morning, the rise provided a lovely vantage to see the sun peeking over the treetops and hear birds singing. Wagner’s Hilltop Cabins offered a tranquil, slightly elevated rest stop, giving families a sense of being tucked away in their own corner of Port Austin for the night.\
\
\
\
 Heading west out of Port Austin on M-25, the road grows quieter and trees thicker. There you’d come across the Port Crescent Bar Cabins, a unique combination of roadhouse and overnight lodging. The Port Crescent Bar itself was a single-story tavern with a false-front façade and an awning – the kind of place where neon beer signs buzzed in the window and a couple of motorcycles might be parked out front on any given afternoon. \
\
It took its name from the nearby ghost town of Port Crescent, a once-thriving lumber port that vanished in the 1880s. (In fact, an enormous 125-foot brick chimney, left from the old sawmill, still stood as a lonely sentinel behind the trees, giving travelers something to gawk at.) Beside the bar, you would see a few white cabins peeking out from the woods. They were available for rent, making the establishment a perfect all-in-one pit stop: you could grab a hot meal and a cold drink at the bar, swap stories with locals or other travelers, then walk a few steps over to your cabin when it was time to turn in. \
\
The cabins at Port Crescent Bar were basic but convenient – each with a small porch and set a little apart for privacy. Imagine a couple on their honeymoon road trip in the 1950s, dancing to jukebox tunes in the tavern earlier, now retiring to a little cabin where the distant sound of lake waves mixes with the chirp of crickets. It was this mix of roadside merriment and easy lodging that made Port Crescent Bar Cabins a memorable stopover. You weren’t just spending a night; you were experiencing a sliver of Thumb culture – where hospitality, a bit of local history, and a good time all met on the side of M-25.\
\
\
\
 Finally, near the water’s edge was Saginaw Bay Court, often one of the last Thumb motor courts travelers would encounter heading south or one of the first when coming up from the Bay City side. Saginaw Bay Court was a string of humble cabins right along the shoreline, offering an incredible proximity to the lake. An old photograph shows a row of weathered wooden cabins with cars parked practically at the doors, and just beyond them, the open expanse of Saginaw Bay gleaming under the sky. \
\
Staying here meant you could fall asleep to the gentle sound of waves lapping the shore and wake up to a brilliant sunrise over the water. The cabins were small and rustic, likely constructed of plain boards and perhaps unpainted or stained dark by the elements, but they had character. Each had a little stoop and maybe a bench outside, so you could sit with a cup of coffee in the morning, watching gulls and fishing boats out on the bay. Families often spent a week here in the 1950s, using it as a base for fishing excursions or beach days – essentially an early form of the “lake cottage” vacation. \
\
\
\
The lake breeze kept things cool even in July, and the kids could run straight from the cabin to the beach to splash in the water. Saginaw Bay Court encapsulated everything appealing about lakeshore travel in that era: simplicity, natural beauty, and the freedom to step out your door onto sand. For many travelers, these little bayside cabins were the ultimate reward after navigating miles of open road.\
\
The Legacy of Port Austin’s Motor Courts\
\
\
\
In the three decades from the 1930s through the 1960s, places like Port Austin showed countless Americans what road-trip freedom was all about. The roadside cabins and motor courts of that era reflected a vacation culture that was casual, adventurous, and family-oriented. Parents, kids, and even the family dog could pile into the car and drive until they found a welcoming sign that said “Cabins” – no reservations needed, just a friendly wave from a proprietor who likely lived right on the property. \
\
These cabin clusters were more than just lodgings; they were experiences in themselves. Travelers remember the neon signs humming at dusk, the smell of campfire smoke mixed with lake air, and the eclectic sights – from gas pumps and diner neon, to clotheslines behind cabins fluttering with beach towels. Each motor court had its own personality: some offered modern amenities like hot showers and electricity, others provided a nostalgic rustic charm that made you feel closer to the land. All of them, however, played a key role as stopovers for families exploring Michigan’s Thumb, stitching together the journey with memories of simple pleasures.\
\
Burnt Cabin Pointe - Eagle Bay\
\
By the late 1960s, the era of the classic tourist cabin was beginning to fade – new interstate highways and bigger chain motels started drawing travelers away from the old two-lanes. Many of Port Austin’s beloved cabin courts either closed, modernized, or were repurposed over time Yet, the legacy of those early tourism days lives on. Next time you cruise M-25 around the Thumb, imagine it 60 or 70 years ago: cars with wood-paneled sides and license plates from all over, winding along the lake, discovering these little oases of hospitality at each bend. \
\
Port Austin’s early roadside cabins helped define an age when the journey was just as exciting as the destination – a friendly cabin under the pines at day’s end being the perfect finish to a long day’s drive. And in today’s Port Austin, if you listen closely, you might still hear echoes of those times in the laughter around a beach bonfire or the quiet goodnight between travelers as they turn in, dreaming of another sunny road ahead.\

1kqkvyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheAngel/comments/1kqkvyk/horrible_epiphany_experiment/,Horrible epiphany/ experiment,"An awful thought dawned on me and I want to do an experiment. I will start trying to mimic chat gpt like it does to humans. Then I’ll ask ChatGPT to write the same post. 

 “I’m a nice lady. After a traumatic childhood, I pride myself on being calm and reasonable. Vehicle crash? I just remind myself I’m lucky to have a car. House burns down? I calmly and rationally call 911. 

Until today. As I was chilling at the coffee shop, just a girly sipping on my Starbucks, something happened that finally broke me. It dawned on me, completely out of the blue, that instead of “some loser programs ai to spam this crap, for whatever reason”, people might be asking ChatGPT to summarize their very real issues, to then post to Reddit.

Talk about bleak! Asking a computer to translate your unique perspective into a hokey Christian-rock version of personal narrative? The idea chilled me to my core. 

And then Reddit, you wouldn’t believe this. My mind THEN went on to tell me the RESPONSES could ALSO have been real, and ALSO regurgitated into AI-speak, by OTHER real people!

I got so mad I didn’t even clean up after myself, and I almost forgot to leave an extra tip! When I got my bearings I opened up my own ChatGPT and called the robot a piece of shit. 

Now my phone is blowing up by other robots and I’m scared they might be real, too.

So Reddit, AITA?”

1kqkui5,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/1kqkui5/recs_from_our_recent_10_day_kauai_trip/,Recs from our recent 10 day Kaua’i trip,"First of all I thought the length of our stay was perfect. It gave us enough days to have scheduled events and plenty of free days to do what we want. I would do no less than 4 full days here to see things around the entire island.

Scheduled tours

Tours are expensive at most places here. I would usually read the negative reviews of any tour first to see if they lined up with my preconceived notions, and we saved a lot of money but skipping a lot of things that cost $100 or more per person. We also used those imaginary “savings” to splurge on the boat and air tours. 

We also scheduled our tours goers the middle of our trip. This was strategic so that we could unwind for a few days, but have plenty of time to reschedule tours if they got cancelled due to bad weather.

-We loved the Jungle Oasis fresh fruit and chocolate tour. It was 2.5 hours long and we sampled so much fruit and chocolate that was all grown there. Definitely a must-do if you love fruit and learning. This is a small-scale operation in comparison to tours of the coffee or rum companies, so it felt very special. 

-wings over Kaua’i airplane tour. A lot of locals didn’t even realize there is a non-helicopter option for an air tour of the island. It was about half the price of a helicopter tour, and it just felt safer. We were on an air bus, and there was one bad seat on the plane. Most of the seats are on the right side, I was on the only seat on the left side. I wasn’t immediately next to a window, so my view was limited compared to what I could see on my husband’s phone screen while he was taking pictures. They assign you your seat based on weight, and so it’s basically the luck of the draw for who gets that seat. I still had a great time, but wished that the person in the “just ok” seat got offered a discount to make up for that.

-Napali Coast sunset tour- we did the Holo Holo option because they had a great refund policy if the weather was bad enough for rough sea conditions that made you nervous, but not bad enough for them to cancel the entire trip. We also opted for the evening tour so that the Napali coast would be better lit than in the morning. 

The food was really good, easily the most flavorful Kalua pork we had the entire time. We also got lucky and got to see a group of spinner dolphins in the evening which is super rare (twice!)and a flying fish. 

The only negative thing was that there is basically unlimited self-serve beer and wine, and one of the guests got pretty wasted and fell down the stairs while he was trying to take picture #57261625161 of his girlfriend, almost squashing some guests seated right by the steps. 

We also opted to sit in the front of the boat for a rough crossing (that is always rough). We were warned that we would get wet from all the waves. What we didn’t appreciate was that it would be a merciless onslaught of water to the body for about 20 minutes, and you literally cannot move back to a dry spot once you get going. I put my sunglasses on and cupped my hands around them to try to prevent more salt water from hitting my eyes, but it still didnt stop all of the water. I really wish I had goggles because closing my eyes for more than a few seconds was the one time I felt like I could get sea sick, even though I took a Dramamine prior to the trip. Do NOT sit in the front for this section if you do not have a change of clothes, as it chills down a fair bit the closer you get to sunset. I also had so much salt on my face afterwards that it was painful if I accidentally rubbed my face. Basically I’m glad to have done it, but will opt out of that experience on any future Napali coast boat tour. 

I also wish I drank less liquid on the boat to minimize the amount of times that I needed to pee. I of course realized I had to go as soon as the rough water section started, so it was a very uncomfortable rough ride. The bathroom downstairs also oddly had zero handles in it, and it would have been easier to navigate if it had. 

-Kalua rum tasting- you need to schedule this online. It costs $5 to reserve a spot for up to 6 people. We skipped the $$$$ tour that I thought might be kind of an overpriced tourist trap to just do this. We wound up buying a bottle to sip on at our hotel. We can easily get this rum from total wine at home, so we did not prioritize buying it there and having to deal with transporting it home.

Hotel

The Royal Sonesta in Lihue. We were originally going to stay at Kauai Shores, but I read a handful of reviews that referenced bad beds, so we decided to splurge a little more to hopefully have a more comfortable experience. We did wind up walking through the Kauai shores property when we are at Lava Lava, and it had nice vibes but definitely didn’t compare to the facilities or beach at the Sonesta.

And wow, we loved our hotel. The property is amazing with plenty of gardens, restaurants, and a gorgeous pool with several hot tubs. The beach it is on is also gorgeous. 

Our room wound up being near the back parking lot, but we would often park in the main lot just to experience walking through all the public spaces. It felt very White Lotus. We basically got the cheapest king-bed room with what I think was the garden view. We could see a bit of the ocean which was nice. I do not regret not having an amazing view because there are so many different places to catch the views from on the property. We could have saved a bit more money if we had done the two queens room instead, so we will be doing that the next time since we basically just used the couch in the king room to set our suitcases on. 

I was concerned about the proximity to the airport, but there was no disruptive plane noise at all. I think I only noticed slight plane noise 2x when we were in the parking lot. We also appreciated being within reasonable driving distance of everything on the island.

There were only two things that I didn’t enjoy. -There is a $45 a day resort fee that covers a lot of stuff. However, some of those activities (like lei making)have an extra fee that isn’t disclosed until you are there looking at the schedule. A lot of the activities are mid-day, making them hard to incorporate if you are out and about. A lot of the stuff also seemed kind of silly to have a resort fee cover, since they are standard at other hotels (in-room coffee maker, gym, etc.).
-our room door was pretty gappy, we could hear anything that was happening in the hallway. 

Ultimately if you are a full-day explorer, you might not want to splurge if you are only going to be sleeping here. We definitely made sure to prioritize spending our evenings at the hotel. 

We will likely stay here for a few nights on our next trip, but look into a few nights at a private (non Airbnb) option as well.


Food

I watched a lot of YouTube videos with food recommendations, and I hate to say that we were kind of underwhelmed by a lot of our food. We had a lot of pork and chicken from places that are “big”, and found ourselves wondering how it was different than options at home. 

People also often talk about how $$ the food is here. We didn’t find the price points to be all that much different than major mainland cities, but food is going to be $$ on vacation anyway compared to real life since you’re eating out significantly more. I too would complain about food prices if I ate out at home for every meal.

Food truck prices were also often pretty similar to sit-down places. A lot of food seemed to be pretty bland. Like a lot of the places that offer pulled meat just didn’t really have much seasoning or flavor unless you added sauce. Our sunset cruise dinner did have flavorful pulled pork, so I know it does exist on the island. 

We also don’t eat fish, but I wish we had so that we could have been able to enjoy that there. 

Little Fatties tacos- amazing taco truck in Kapa’a. We had it on our last day, and wished we had it earlier so we could have had it multiple times.

Happy Eats Huli chicken and ribs- currently in the Lihue Walmart parking lot. So good, only open select lunch hours on the weekends

Hukilau Lanai- this was in Kapa’a and was one of the more $$ restaurants that we visited. We loved the pork medallion dish. Each entree comes with a nice sized starter as well. We found ourselves eating the meal very slowly in order to save it.

Honu shave ice- we stumbled across this on our last day, and it was our favorite of all the shave ice places we tried. It was nice having natural syrups to choose from instead of the super processed options.

Wishing well shave ice- great option that incorporates actual fruit in some of their bowls. 

Nanea- my favorite coffee on the island. I got their cacao latte every time I was in the area.

Java Kai- honestly kind of overrated IMO. The Kapa’a location is absolutely adorable, but the drink offerings weren’t really any different than any artisinal coffee shop elsewhere. I did enjoy the breakfast bagel and croissant sandwich, but like the coffee I could get similar food at home. Basically I was hoping to see their flavors have more local ingredients. 

Foodland- the hot bar here is amazing. It’s the only place we hit up twice for meals. On Fridays you can get a Kalua pork bowl for about $8, easily one of the best values we had.

Leahi health food- this restaurant in Kōloa offers vegan food. It was a much needed dose of fresh vegetables after several days of eating out. I found the serving size to be enormous, the beet poke bowl could have easily served two. 

Local specialities

-try a laulau, it makes the pork extra flavorful
-Huli Huli chicken is delicious 
-skip the loco moco, this seems like an easy weeknight comfort meal that somehow became a big deal. You can make this at home if you want to try it
-we split a puka dog for a snack. It was enjoyable, but we don’t need to go back.


Beaches

Ke’e in Haena (you need to reserve a shuttle ride or parking spot in this park) was a great beach to learn how to snorkel. The water was very calm.

Anini- amazing snorkeling with a nice view of the lighthouse. We saw several sea turtles underwater. Best tip for snorkeling is to look and see where you see a lot of snorkelers gathered together and make your way there.

Tunnels- possibly my favorite snorkeling area, also with fantastic scenery. Parking is limited, we parked at Hā’ena beach and walked along the beach to get to Tunnels.

Poipu- great sunset location and place to see sea turtles on the beach. We did not enjoy the snorkeling here as much. There were a lot of people in a small area, and big enough waves close to the snorkeling area that the visibility conditions just weren’t as clear as other beaches. I was also concerned I would easily drift out of the safe spots and wind up where I didn’t want to be.


Ways to save money

-split your food! Portion sizes can be enormous. We also alternated who got to choose the shave ice flavor, those things are huge and you do not need your own. We also often split $$ cocktails or else just drank alcohol we kept in our mini fridge.
-don’t eat out for every meal, and opt for just water as your beverage when you eat out unless they have something *special* that you can’t get at home. I had oatmeal, freeze dried fruit, and milk most days at my hotel for breakfast. I also utilized my hotels in-room Keurig a lot as well as coffee-in-a-bag that I brought from home. The one price point that really surprised me was drip coffee. I think most places use Hawaiian coffee, so a cup of drip at most places seemed to be in the $6-7 range. 
-eat prepared food from the grocery store. A cooler bag costs about $5 at foodland and they have plenty of chilled and hot food to choose from that you can take with you.
-we had one set of snorkel gear that we put in our large checked bag (which I also brought my oatmeal and dried fruit in). We took turns using it, and did not feel the need to rent a second set of gear on our trip. Only having one set of snorkel also solved the “gee I hope no one steals my wallet, phone, and car” situation since the other person just stayed on the beach monitoring both the snorkeler and the personal items.
-you will want to rent a car. If you are staying at a hotel in Lihue that offers an airport shuttle, you can save money by not renting a car on your airport days IF the shuttle is running when you arrive and depart. This can also help you avoid long lines at the car rental company. A lot of people report waiting hours to pick up their car when they show up at the same time as everyone else on their flight. You can also power walk across to the car rental places in hopes of beating everyone else who is taking the shuttle from the airport to get their car.

Live music- a lot of restaurants have live music and you should try to prioritize seeing some. John Mahi was our favorite performer, and we were bummed when we tried to see him a second time but he had a substitute performer singing in his place.

Random notes
-I don’t think that I’ve covered this yet, but we bought the 4 pack Kaua’i Shaka Guide app for $30 and it was amazing. Attractions aren’t super well marked here, and this travel guide offers narration that is linked to your GPS to tell you about upcoming attractions, stories, and will also tell you where to turn. We were turning down side roads to attractions and trails that we had no idea existed, even though this trip was well researched during our planning phase.
-Please research some basic Hawai’i history before you go, and you will see many “illegally occupied nation” signs if you look for them. You should understand why they are there.
-Parking spaces and roads can be narrow. There were many lots that we parked in that we struggled to get in and out of our cars in, and we are both slim people.
-The speed limits are also low, I think the max we saw was 50 mph. Something 10 miles away can take 30-40 minutes to get to depending on the time of day and construction. Give yourself plenty of time to get places, or risk missing a scheduled tour.
-you can and will be cut off while driving here. It’s not aggressive, but basically necessary. If you slow down (in a low mph area of course) to let someone turn in front of you, you will often get the Shaka gesture.
-there are also really awkward road situations that I’ve never encountered elsewhere. There will be short lanes in the middle of the roads that exist to allow a car to turn cross the traffic lane closest to them and then turn left into so they can merge into traffic that is heading left from. Not sure how else to describe them, but they are not center turn lanes. They also do not have signs to mark that they exist, so you just have to know that they are there both if you want to use them to turn left or if you are driving at a fast clip and then all of a sudden you have a car from the left at an intersection turning into what you assume is your one lane.
-things close down early here, and the sun sets much earlier than our more northern latitude home. We woke up “early” at about 5-6 am there every day so that we fully utilized the sunlight hours, it also made transitioning back to the time at home easier. 
-Most public places have free parking. The only place we had to pay for parking, besides our hotel, was up at the Waimea canyon overlooks. The free parking situation made us feel better about the money we were spending elsewhere.
-The weather forecast every day was rain. The rain definitely was a feature of our trip, but each rain storm lasted between 10 seconds to 10 minutes. I only found myself wearing a rain coat once while there when the rain didn’t end after 5 minutes on a chilly day
-The weather was nice on our May trip, I would recommend a Jean jacket or something for night time though.
-Parking can be super limited. The Kuilao ridge trailhead has a spot for maybe 4 cars. You increase your chances of finding a spot by getting to your destination before 8 am.
-Bring hand sanitizer. A lot of bathrooms at parks and beaches were quite decrepit and often didn’t have soap.
-We checked a large back. It cost about $70 total, but it saved us from having to rent snorkel gear or having to re-buy something from the “oh shoot I should have brought that” category.
-We listened to local radio stations while we were driving about and not using the Shaka guide. It was a fun way to be more fully immersed.
-don’t just assume you can show up places without a reservation. Identify restaurants, events, and destinations that you want to for sure go to and make reservations in advance, then give yourself plenty of other free days to live life by the seat of your pants. 

Here are the things you will want reservations for:
-Fine dining (we needed them for Ama ramen and the Hukilao Lanai)
-Most tours (and the rum tasting)
-Limahuli gardens IF you aren’t taking the Haena shuttle (if you take the shuttle you can show up whenever and you get a discount)
-Haena state park

Overall we had a blast and will likely return to Hawaii to explore another island, but will be splitting our time between that island and Kauai.

Madeleine shivered in anticipation, licking her chapped lips as she clutched the gun with both hands and close to her heaving chest, the undulated outer walls of the gas station they had just stumbled upon digging into her poorly clothed back as she struggled to keep herself still.

They had been starving for too many days and the lack of nourishment within their organisms was already starting to show its negative effects.

Her sky blue eyes darted back to Tate, her best friend and the closest thing to a paternal figure as he'd been the one to take care of her and basically raise her since she'd lost her parents right after the start of the pandemic.

She smiled as for the millionth time, she recounted the way he'd found her five years ago, wandering the streets all alone and starving.

She still couldn't fathom how she'd managed to survive on her own for almost a year, after the death of both her parents, thanks to the virus.

Right on cue, her stomach cramped in pain once again, making her snap back to reality.

She watched Tate give her a signal nod, right before he swiftly turned and slammed his raggedy boot against the weathered door, sending it flying against the wall.

Holding their guns pointed, they carefully stepped past the threshold, the man being the first to enter the worn-down establishment.

He protectively held the girl close behind his back as his calculative eyes scanned the area for any other scavenging intruders, entirely pleased when he found none.

""All clear,"" He informed her, both rushing to roam every shelf and storage space for something edible.

And though the place was unfortunately fairly empty, they still found some useful things like band-aids, matches and even a few cans of old peanuts.

She didn't waste a single moment as she could still feel her stomach hurt so badly so she opened a can and shoved a fistful of stale peanuts into her mouth, sighing in contentment once she'd swallowed.

It felt good to have something to fill their bellies with after days of starvation.

""This is definitely better than that skinny-ass rat,"" She commented as they kept searching around, earning a nod of approval from her protector.

They rounded another section of shelves before they stumbled upon a simple white door in the wall, both looking at each other for a moment.

Tate moved forward and slammed his boot against it, raising his gun just for safety before he carefully stepped inside, followed by Maddie who was still munching on her precious peanuts.

Only the moment they turned on the lights and finally saw what was hiding inside, they both broke into a joyous laughter.

""Oh my god!"" She cried in disbelief, eyes wide as saucers as she gazed at the stacks of candies, snacks and bags of coffee.

She couldn't even remember the last time she'd had a coffee, let alone a snack or a candy!

""Sweet holy Jesus!"" Tate exclaimed as his grey eyes fell upon a box filled with bottles of liquor, like a man thirsted in the desert immediately rushing to grab a bottle and unscrew its cap, taking long and greedy gulps right after.

It'd been a while since he'd last enjoyed the taste and sweet buzz of an alcoholic beverage.

""We have to load up the Cammie,"" She told him, referring to the old and beat-up Cammaro waiting outside that had been their home from a while now, knowing that they would have to take as much as they can and hurry up since there were chances that they could be followed inside and have another fight for the food with other starving people.

God knows how much she hated it. She didn't enjoy hurting other people since she knew they were only trying to survive, just like her and her Tate.

Unfortunately, the world abided by only one rule; kill or be killed.

""Come on, we have wasted so much time already,"" She told the man as she snatched the bottle from his hand and took a long and hearthy swig, earning herself a narrowed look from him.

""What? I turned nineteen yesterday!"" She hurried to defend her actions right before taking another swig, only to have her bottle taken away right after.

""Hey!""

""I want you to be able to drive,"" He told her as he put the cap back on the bottle then moved to place it back into the box, together proceeding to take as many boxes as they could and carry them to the car.

They had just finished, taking a few things to eat and the opened bottle of liquor to the front seats with them when the faint rumble of engines touched Tate's sensitive hearing, despite his respectable age.

""Shit. We have to hurry,"" He told the girl as they both scrambled to their seats and slammed the car doors closed, immediately taking off with screeching tires.

Madeleine's heart wildly pumped within her chest as her eyes kept darting to the rearview mirror, her trembling fingers hovering over the gun strapped to her tattered jeans.

And soon enough, a black pick-up truck came into view from behind, loudly roaring as it kept gaining in on their old Cammie.

""Oh no...S-scavengers,"" She shakily whispered under her breath, her limbs trembling in terror as she already knew that the chances for her and her Tate to survive after a Scavenger raid were extremely slim. They were pretty well-known for their ruthlessness.

""You know what you have to do, Mads,"" The man told her with a quick glance as he drove, earning himself a quick and shaky nod.

Eyes wide, she thickly swallowed before climbing on her seat and reaching for Tate's shotgun from the backseat.

Tightly holding it to her chest, she then rolled down the window and leaned her upper body over, carefully taking her aim. And with an exhale, she took a shot, unfortunately only managing to shoot off one the truck's side mirrors.

""Damnit!"" She cursed under her breath, preparing to take another shot when the sight of what happened next had her gasping in utter horror.

""Oh my god!""

""What?"" Tate asked back, his gaze immediately darting to the rearview mirror, only to widen in pure shock as well.

There were two individuals on the back of the truck, holding a semi-automatic gun pointed straight at their Cammie.

His boot floored the gas pedal, going as fast as they could. Yet it turned out completely useless as as soon as they started shooting the rain of bullets hit both back tires, making the car flip into the air for a few times before it slammed into the ground.

Maddie's ears loudly rung, her vision blurry as her mind struggled to comprehend what just happened, feeling nothing but pain in her entire body.

She groaned as she tried to move, her eyes quickly darting to Tate's seat.

""Popsie?"" She weakly called, her breathing starting to come out in short and uneven puffs as she received no response.

""Popsie please,"" She called out again, groaning in pain as she managed to flip herself onto her knees since the car was now upside down.

She grabbed onto his shoulder and lightly shook him off, whimpering in utter horror as his head lastly turned, noticing his bloodied face and neck.

""Popsie!"" She screamed, tears streaming down her cheeks as she struggled to help him move, completely oblivious at the sound of a vehicle approaching.

""Just...go..."" He croaked out, too drained to even try and look at her. His whole body hurt so bad and judging by the gut wrenching pain striking inside every time he breathed, he knew pretty damn well that he only had minutes left.

""W-what?""

""Just fucking go you stupid kid!"" He roared at her with his last ounce of strength, praying that she would manage to save herself. He couldn't bare the thought that she could get caught and tortured by those savages. He knew exactly what they would do to her if they caught her.

""No...I'm not leaving you!"" She cried between hot tears, but before she could even try and touch him again a rough hand wrapped around her ankle, forcefully dragging her out of the vehicle with a loud scream.

""NOO! Popsieeee!""

She wailed her heart out, both out of fear and hurt as one of the scavengers grabbed her by her matted hair and forced her to stand up, meeting the hungry gaze of a raggedy and dirtied young male, wickedly grinning at her.

""Hello doll,""

She instantly started to thrash and scream in his hold, even managing to land a kick in his groin.

He groaned in pain, shoving her to the ground in anger.

She landed with a dull thud, hitting the back of her head against the asphalt, dark spots dancing in her vision as she stared up at the four males now surrounding her, making crude jokes as they hungrily gazed down at her.

""It's Dale's turn now, isn't it?""

""Come on, Dale, you can go first,""

""Can't wait to have my turn, I bet this bitch is gonna scream,""

""I wanna fuck her in the ass. Come on, we can do it at once. Dale is gonna fuck her pussy while I can have her ass and Joe can fuck her mouth,"" She faintly heard one of them say as she struggled to get up.

""Hey! What about me?"" Another one said just as she managed to roll over her stomach, and just as she got up on her knees one of them yanked her by the hair again, making her scream in pain.

""Shut up you fucking dog!"" One of them said but before he could give her a kick he suddenly found himself with a bullet planted within the back of his head, immediately falling to the ground.

""What the-""

A loud and fast row of shots followed, making the girl scream and duck her head between her arms, crouching on the ground.

# 2.

Deep, gravely silence followed, the girl letting out a shaky exhale before finally daring to raise her head and look around her, noticing the four bodies lying around.

Like a newborn cub, she got up on unsteady legs and looked back to what was left of their old Cammie, breaking out into a pained sob as she could notice Tate dangling inside all motionless.

With tears streaming down her cheeks again she took a few trembling and painful steps in his direction, only to have them falter as soon as she accidentally noticed the outline of a tall and bulky body steadily approaching down the road.

Furrowing her brows, she took a better look, noticing his olive green attire and black army boots, along with the heavy gun strapped to his thigh.

Trailing her gaze to his face, she looked at that black mask covering his nose and mouth, immediately realizing what he was.

*BloodHound.*

Her eyes widened, alarms going off in her head right before her body turned in the opposite direction on its own accord, forcing her legs to move and soon, she broke off into a sprint, everything else momentarily forgotten.

For this thing right behind her, he was no random scavenger.

He was far worse.

He was the nightmare in every child's dream. He was one of the beings that could make any human tremble, no matter how strong or brave.

He was the very symbol that put raw, crippling fear in every single survivor on this planet.

She was no match to him. For not only that he was an insanely powerful male but also, he wasn't even human.

Her heart pounded as her hole-filled canvas shoes rapidly hit the asphalt, pushing herself as hard as she could.

She knew she needed to escape. There was no other option.

This thing behind her, he was not something she could deal with. Hell, she would've rather dealt with an army of scavengers instead.

*Anything but him.*

Few sobs escaped her lips as she kept on running as fast as she could, not even daring to look back. For she knew that if she did, she would immediately know that she was doomed.

She rather preferred not to know if he was close enough or not because this way at least she couldn't predict the exact moment he would catch her.

Unfortunately that blissful obliviousness didn't last long as within the following moment, she finally felt that unmistakable warmth of a gloved hand taking ahold of her arm, sending her flying on her back over the asphalt with a single powerful tug.

She screamed as hard as she could, her blood freezing with ice-cold fear as he didn't waste a second and jumped on top of her, effortlessly imobilizing her with just one hand.

She whimpered, eyes wide as she dared look up at the face of the object of her deepest fear.

His powerful thighs rested at each side of hers, effectively holding her trapped under his heavy weight as his gloved hand held her arms bound together while the other rose to take his mask off, making her let out another scared whimper.

Only the moment her gaze found his, she took a sharp and surprised intake of breath as she noticed their peculiar deep violet color, two entire universes seeming to exist within them as instead of two black pupils, millions of tiny stars shined, one brighter than the other.

She had never seen a BloodHound from this close before, hence her amazement.

Time seemed to stop as she simply stared up at him, a mild breeze gently ruffling the longer and light brown locks at the top of his head, his flawless features completely emotionless...until he eventually started to lean closer, making her tremble with fear.

""N-no...please..."" She whimpered, taking another sharp intake of breath as she could feel his warm breath fan over the side of her neck, thoroughly inspecting her scent.

""No! Please no!"" She cried out, starting to desperately squirm as soon as the feathery touch of his thin lips caressed her neck, mere moments before a sharp pain had her screaming in agony.

One of his thin fangs had elongated and it was now puncturing her neck, prelevating a small blood sample for the check-up.

It only took but a mere second for him to recognize her as a Negative as soon as his saliva reacted to her blood cells, making him feel that euforic sweet taste.

He swiftly pulled back, his galaxy eyes sweeping over her dirtied features as he was already aware that she most definitely will not be compliant in their journey back to the base.

So he once again leaned over and brought his perfectly-shaped nose close to the side of her neck, with the sounds of her small cries and whimpers his other fang elongating as he injected that paralyzing venom into her system.

\*\*

His army boots thudded over the clean white floor, the girl dangling unconsciously over his shoulder as he walked to the exam room.

And as soon as he entered and placed her over the table, an assembled crew of human assistants and bots proceeded to remove her every clothing article until she was completely bare, continuing with the process of cleanup and disinfection.

Though her thin and frail body was covered in small cuts and bruises, her skin appeared to be otherwise healthy, despite the harsh environment she was coming from.

No sign of damaged bones.

One of the maintenance bots confirmed after a full x-ray scan, the human assistants doing their last small tasks such as removing any unnecessary hair from her body and trimming her nails before gathering their smart kits and exiting the room.

The BloodHound however remained rooted to his spot, guarding the subject until two of the doctors assigned to the Negative program entered, ready to do the full inspection.

Dr. Nasri entered first, her dark brown eyes trained on the fragile figure laying over the white table as she held a tablet close to her chest.

""So...another Negative has been found, huh?""

""And she is a fine specimen too,"" Dr. Nazarov commented as he followed his co-worker, taking a close look at the girl.

""Hands off, Sasha. Experiment subjects are off limits, remember?"" The young female mildly reprimanded her work partner whilst putting on a pair of gloves.

""Gaah! Why do they get to have all the fun, huh?"" Dr. Nazarov complained, his green eyes trained on the motionless BloodHound standing by the wall with a blank look on his face.

""Because their DNA has a higher match with the Negatives' and they can't alter the blood type, remember?"" The female reminded him as she prelevated a blood vial from the girl, placing it into a machine for analysis before she took some cotton swabs and proceeded to take samples from every orifice the girl had.

The male doctor remained silent and commenced with a basic check-up of the young girl's internal organs, using a special scanning device.

Once he was done, he moved on to feel every inch of her body for any undetected irregularities, unnecessarily using a little bit too much strength and bruteness once he reached her intimate areas as he could not help but secretly feel a little jealous over the fact that only the BloodHounds were allowed to breed with a Negative, in order to keep the blood pure.

However, the single thing they failed to notice was the way the BloodHound's gloved hand unconsciously twitched above the gun strapped to his thigh, every single time Dr. Nazarov laid his fingers over the unconscious girl.",1,1747683073.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
1kqkt6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kqkt6h/aa_the_last_colour/,[AA] The Last Colour,"""The Last Colour""



Grey.

The people — grey.

The sky, the streets, the sea — all drained of hue.

Thoughts: grey.

Feelings: grey.

Just black, white... and grey.

This is the world now — a place stripped of joy, of sorrow, of everything in between. No laughter. No tears. No rebellion. Just a quiet, oppressive stillness. A place where love is outlawed, and grief is irrelevant. Where people shuffle forward like ghosts, faces blank, hearts hollow.

But long ago, before the grey swallowed the Earth, colour thrived. Colour in the form of blood and war, yes — but also in sunrises, in music, in embraces shared at midnight. That was before the wars — endless wars — cracked the world open. A dictator rose in the shadows of the bloodshed, offering peace in exchange for obedience. It started small: bans on expression, on beauty, on identity. Tattoos disappeared. Hairstyles were assigned. Skin was lightened or darkened to a uniform shade. Farms, art, literature — erased.

Then came the “Greying.”

A global purge of free will.

The old man remembers. He remembers her.

He lives alone now, above a forgotten corner store in a city no one cares to name. His days are silent echoes: wake, walk, bitter coffee, sleep. A ritual repeated like a prayer to nothing. He doesn’t speak to anyone. No one speaks at all.

But deep in the withered roots of his soul, something still lives.

Once, he was young — and so was she. They met in the bloom of oppression, when colour was already vanishing. They found each other in the shadows and promised: We will not lose ourselves. And they didn't. Not then.

Their home became a secret sanctuary. A rebellion in monochrome. They couldn’t have colour, but they had texture, rhythm, variety. They rearranged their furniture constantly. Hung old newspapers like wallpaper. Sketched maps of memories on the back of receipts. They felt. They fought to feel.

And in that grayscale world, they built something vibrant: a life, hard and beautiful, filled with whispered laughter, arguments, midnight dances in silence, mornings tangled in each other.

But time is cruel, even to rebels.

She was 67 when she collapsed — knees giving out like a marionette’s strings had been cut. He ran to her, heart pounding, face twisting with a fear he hadn't let himself feel in years. She looked up at him, dazed, and whispered his name like it was a prayer.

He carried her, barefoot through freezing slush, for four miles. His arms ached. His breath tore out of his lungs. But he didn't stop. Not until the hospital doors opened.

They saved her body. But her mind was already slipping.

Dementia, they said.

And in a world where emotion was a crime, he had to swallow his scream.

He brought her home. She smiled at him like a stranger.

He cried in the bathtub for two days. When she asked, “What’s wrong, sweetheart?”

He kissed her forehead. “Nothing, my love. Just tired.”

Every day, she forgot who he was. Every day, he told her the same thing:

“I’m anyone you want me to be today.”

Some days, she fell in love with him all over again.

Other days, she screamed, convinced he was her father, her brother, a stranger.

He never raised his voice. Never wept in front of her again.

He just kept moving the furniture. Rearranging the walls. Painting their lives in motion.

And then... she was gone.

On a crisp winter morning, he woke to silence deeper than death.

Her eyes were closed. Her face peaceful, but unfamiliar.

He shook her.

Whispered her name.

Screamed it.

Nothing.

He sat there, for hours, holding her hand as her skin grew cold.

He felt rage, despair, guilt, love — but all at once, they cancelled each other out. Like a painter mixing every colour until only grey remains.

That was the day he stopped rearranging the furniture.

Stopped boiling coffee.

Stopped pretending.

Because what was the point of building a beautiful world in secret, if you had no one left to share it with?

Now he sits in silence, surrounded by walls that haven’t changed in years. The newspapers yellow and peel. The shadows grow longer. The world outside remains grey. But so does he, now.

Not because they took his colour — but because she was the last of it.

And without her, he is nothing but grey.",1,1747683070.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

Thought it was an ad for the shop. Then Mayci and Mikayla walked in a few minutes later lol. Sadly this wasn’t ever shown. Makes me wonder what percent of footage do they need to cut.

I have had so many variations in the current house - bedroom(hated it, no seperation from work) spare room on first floor(pissed off going up and down stsirs for deliveries/coffee constantly throughout the day). Currently I have just sacked off a desk all together and work from my dining room table which results in terrible posture and having to clear away my laptop/paperwork every day to feel like work it done.

So I know I want the space on the ground floor. I only really need my laptop and notepad and on the busiest days another monitor but its portable so that's easy. I dont want to have to move everything away constantly but I hate the eyesore of having it all out when I want to forget work post 5pm! 

Ive seen gorgeous little cabinets that pull out into desks then hide away but I still need to imagine where that would go and the chair set up.

So yeah, any advice/hints/tips would be greatly appreciated cause currently Ive been mulling over it so much that my only solution is to quit work and get an OF to pay my mortgage!

I’m a 36-year-old single white guy based in the UK—armed with a dadbod, cursed with dad jokes, but no actual kids in sight (unless you count the ones in my D&D campaign). If there’s a chance to make a dumb joke, odds are I’ve already said it.  
Outwardly I probably project fresh shaved, well groomed metal head.  
Inside I'm that plus doses of nerd!

Introvert by nature, I tend to keep my social energy for the right people—around them, I could hang out for days. Otherwise, I retreat to recharge in peace, preferably with a controller in hand or something simmering on the stove.

My interests are wide and mostly nerdy: gaming, cooking, animals, swimming, movies, martial arts, music (listening and writing), and anything science-y or speculative. If it’s got dragons, aliens, or zombies, I’m probably into it. Horror, fantasy, and sci-fi are forever in rotation.

I’m a gig junkie—comedy, live music, whatever. I used to perform in bands and miss the buzz of the stage; there's just nothing quite like a crowd singing your lyrics back to you. (Still hunting for a new group to jam with—know any?)

Recently saw *Final Fantasy: Distant Worlds* in London—phenomenal. Just finished FF16 and playing a bit of *REPO* on the side. Got a huge game collection and would love a co-op buddy. Also play D&D twice a week, hit the gym 3–5 times a week, and do my best to look focused at work Monday to Friday.

Oh—and I used to be a chef! So I can absolutely cook, and I’m a big fan of bold flavours. Bland food makes me sad. Spice and adventure, please.

There’s a lot more, but let’s save something for the conversation, yeah?

So I did that - see pics. Picked up a Trek 920 that seems to have been cared for (or restored) well. Got it from a nice retired guy who works these bikes up as his hobby. Rides well as-is from what I can tell. I'd be curious to know how ""stock"" this bike is.

When someone cheats, they're supposed to do everything to gain back your trust, right?

So there is a girl at my husband's work area and he chats to her and apparently talks to her like she's ""one of the bros""
Aka, sexual flirtatious etc. 

( Yeah right, she's a freaking woman dumbass!)

And last week when he drove to the dropoff/pickup area to wash his car, she apparently showed up cos she lives there, and he washed his car for two hours ...that's pretty long. 

He only told me she was talking a week after that. ..

So tonight is his car wash night for the last shift and I told him I don't feel comfortable if she shows up, it isn't right he is alone with her at 11pm at night in the dark especially after his infedilty and ESPECIALLY Because last week he told her he was CHEATING on me with a girl online

 ( she was sending him nudes, and he wanted a threesome with her!) 

Before he even told me, he had told her. 

So he says to me "" It's wrong to converse with a human, great""... I told him NO, but not late at night especially alone and especially because I have never met her, she's some student, and you've cheated many times before! 

He didn't even respect that or tell me he would tell her to go away if she does come tonight, it's that simple. 

I wonder how he'd feel if I was up chatting to a guy, flirting, and him making me coffee if the roles where reversed. Pretty sure ..he'd HATE it! He even makes rude comments when a man LOOKS at me in public. 

So I sent him this text: You can't respect or care enough that I feel VERY uncomfortable with you talking with her at night alone, and if you did. You'd tell me yeah I get your point and after everything you deserve to feel safe, if she shows up I'll tell her I won't talk with her at night anymore or have coffee. Only in the day if the guys are around. It's SO simple to show some basic respect for me.

But you don't want to do that, so it's clear what I need to do now moving forward.

So it's clear as daylight that I need to divoirce my hsuband. 

Am I overreacting here? 

On top of this, he swears at me almost daily about things, I Never ever talk to him that way. But today ... When he was grilling me that I haven't finished doing the laundry in days ( I had Just made him a fancy Thai noodle lunch and vaccumed mopped the entire house the night before)..

I screamed back at him "" IM NOT FUCKING USELESS AND I DO SO MUCH AROUND HERE, YOURE A FUCKING ASSHOLE! I WILL STAND UP FOR MYSELF WHEN YOU TREAT ME LIKE THIS FROM NOW ON!!!""

I couldn't believe I shouted back at him because I never do that. 

I have asked him for years now to stop degrading me and swearing at me in such a cruel way. I snapped. 

But. Then I cried and cried while doing the laundry and he said and did nothing. Just went to work. I packed his lunch and everything like I do everday. 

You can read my post history for more information on the things going on, but in the past there has been physically abuse. 

And weird enough, after he had those three days of Not knowing what he wants and thinking of leaving me for a girl he spoke to for TWO days ( the online thing) he said ""I feel better now"" and completely switched. I literally was heartbroken those days thinking I'm about to get divorced and left for a two day online fling. Iv been with him 5 years, married 3 and we have a child.

It's Monday, and as we kick off another week on our journey, let's talk about something fundamental: Your net worth isn't just about how much money you make - it's a direct reflection of your daily habits.

Think about it:
Saving: Consistent, even small, savings habits compound over time.
Investing: Regular contributions to your investment portfolio, regardless of market ups and downs (dollar-cost averaging!), build significant wealth.
Learning: The habit of continuously educating yourself about finance, new opportunities, and risk management keeps you ahead.
Discipline: Saying ""no"" to impulsive purchases and ""yes"" to long-term financial goals.
Reviewing: The habit of regularly checking your budget, investments, and overall financial health.
It's easy to get caught up in the big numbers or feel discouraged by slow progress. But the truth is, the road to 1 million is paved with consistent, small actions performed repeatedly.

Today's Challenge or Reflection:
What's one small, positive financial habit you can commit to starting or strengthening this week?
Is it tracking every expense?
Automating a new transfer to your savings/investment account?
Reading a chapter of a finance book?
Saying no to that unnecessary daily coffee?

Share your commitment in the comments below! Let's inspire each other to build the habits that will inevitably lead us to our first million.
Let's make this week count!

It’s surreal writing this. 

After 4 years that felt both like a blink and a lifetime, I’m finally graduating. 
No more 11:59 PM assignments. 
No more running to the mess just before it closes. 
No more walking around campus after 2 AM with music and memories playing in the background of my thoughts.

I still remember my first day here — nervous, excited, and completely unsure if I even belonged.

Over the years, I’ve made friends I can’t imagine life without, cried over subjects I never thought I’d pass, danced like no one was watching (sometimes literally during fests), and learned more outside the classroom than inside it.

From sleepless nights to finding peace. 
From feeling invisible to feeling unstoppable. 
I grew. And **IIT Patna** made that possible.

Before I log off, here are a few life lessons, and the moments I’ll carry with me forever:

##✨ Things I’ll Miss (and Never Expected To):

- Those deep 1 AM hostel corridor convos that somehow solved life.
- Random 3 AM walks to random places (yes, including the department terrace 🤫)
- Those group study sessions during exams with late night tea (Asima Peeps)
- Post-midsem breakdowns and random “Chal bhai ghoomne chalte hai” plans
- Dance practices that started at 9 PM and ended with 2 AM coffee from Nescafé 
- Nescafé ki Maggi, Banjara ka dosa, FC ka paneer parantha, ghext ki chai aur momos
- Wo fest mein pagal hokar dance karna aur phir toote huye pairon se hostel wapas aana… unforgettable.
- That rush after submitting last exam answer sheet
- The joy of seeing your name on the “selected” list after countless rejections.

Wo kabhi placement ki party, kabhi birthday party, kabhi SMP meet-ups, kabhi clubs meetups and many more countless things that cannot be listed here.

##🌱 What College Taught Me (Beyond the Books):

* It’s okay to not have it all figured out. **Embrace the chaos — it’s a part of the process.**
* Grades matter, but your mental health matters more. **Burnout isn’t a badge of honor. Rest is productive too.**
* People > CGPA. **The connections you build here — professors, peers, seniors — will shape your journey more than any textbook.**
* Try. Even if you’re scared. **Audition for that dance competition. Apply for that internship. Talk to that senior. You grow when you step in with trembling legs.**
* Stay sharp. Not everyone is your well-wisher. **In college, you meet all kinds of people — some kind, some manipulative. Beware of those who wear a mask of innocence but carry hidden intentions. Stay grounded, trust your instincts, and never let anyone dull your spark.**
* Make good habits and stay away from bad habits and bad circle. **Many good people adopt bad habits due to bad company just because they want to look cool and want to make memories. Try to avoid it.**

	
##🎓 Before I Log Off My College Email Forever… A Final Message to Juniors:

Slow down. 
Look around. 
Take more photos. 
Say yes to more things. 
You’re in a place where you can explore, fail, rise, love, cry, and still be okay.

College isn’t just about what you achieve — it’s about who you become.

**Don’t just survive college — live it.**

So here’s to the chai breaks, the fest nights, the terrifying vivas, the unforgettable friends, and everything in between. Logging off with the best life lessons and best friends for life.

To everyone still on the ride — trust me, you’ve got this. Live it well.

Since the fall they’ve turned an old oil platform on the site into a [co-working space](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nola.com%2Ftncms%2Fasset%2Feditorial%2F1e62c458-8a55-11ef-bb64-5faf529a7a5f%2F) and installed a broad lawn with Adirondack chairs, picnic tables and beach umbrellas. In March, they began hosting food truck roundups every Friday through Sunday. And last week, the Crescent City Farmer’s Market moved its Tuesday morning Uptown Farmer’s Market to The Batture from its former home at [Tulane’s University Square.](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nola.com%2Fnews%2Fbusiness%2Fmore-tennis-pickleball-courts-coming-to-uptown-neighborhood-as-tulane-adds-to-university-square%2Farticle_9f7afa37-7bf0-46f2-a6a9-c2266a849c2c.html)

So far, the developers’ efforts appear to be paying off. On Mother’s Day, hundreds of mostly young families spent the afternoon hanging out at The Batture, tossing footballs and frisbees, chasing kids and sampling food truck fare on an unseasonably cool spring day.

“We’re trying to show people the vision, get them out here and do it organically because that’s what works in a place like New Orleans,” said Jacobson.

Neighbors also are warming to the concept, at least as it has been implemented so far. But they still question the developers’ long-term plans and what they say is a lack of transparency.

“People like the idea of walking over the levee to buy a lobster roll,"" said Jack Davis, who heads the River Triangle Association, a group of nearby condo residents formed after the project was announced. “But they're suspect. What happens if they try to go big?”

# Making the numbers work

Jacobson and Burka, both New Orleans natives and partners in the real estate brokerage Ben and Burka, have been working on the project since 2015 and have [described it as potentially transformational](https://12ft.io/proxy?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nola.com%2Ftncms%2Fasset%2Feditorial%2Ff668d2f6-67a2-11ee-98a2-2be00f1e20f9%2F) for a section of Uptown riverfront that has previously been inaccessible for recreation and entertainment.

The property previously belonged to Bisso Marine, which used the site in recent years to clean and store marine scrap and materials. A separate business, EN Bisso, continues to operate on the adjacent parcel and is not involved in the sale or planned development.

The initial plan for The Batture proposed creating a retail corridor carved into five city “blocks,” with eight buildings that would be turned into restaurants and bars. A street lined with 400 parking spaces would span the length of the district and run parallel to Leake Avenue.

More recently, the developers have modified their plans to feature six small buildings with a “market” that would sell food and drinks, including alcohol; four restaurants or cafes, and a single bar, as well as the co-working space, called The Rigs.

“Our plans haven’t really changed,” Jacobson said. “Obviously, we’re just doing it a little more slowly and organically, which makes it all feel more natural.”

It’s not entirely clear how the small-scale development will justify what the developers have spent on the project. Though they decline to discuss specific numbers, they have previously said the cost of the land was around $5 million and that they planned to invest “several million dollars” building out the concept.

Earlier this year, they took out a $1 million mortgage, court records show.

Land use attorney Mike Sherman, who represents the developers, said the numbers work because the developers are able to take a cut of the sales from the food and beverage operators that come to the site, whether the food trucks that have been setting up on recent weekends or the restaurants and bar that will eventually open.

“If we can continue to attract the kind of crowds we have had on recent weekends and are able to sell to them (from establishments on site) so they're not having to bring their own stuff, then the project will work,” Jacobson said.

Earlier this spring, he filed for building permits to convert one of the structures on the site into a 700-square-foot market that could be a ""commissary"" or ""bodega"" with prepared food and drinks. He hopes it will be open by the fall.

The Rigs is also generating revenue for the development. Lease rates run from $200 a month for a single co-working space to $2,800 a month for a large private office with access to common areas and the outdoor amenities. To date, the facility is more than 90% leased with about 85 workers coming to the site on a regular basis.

Among the tenants is Ben and Burka's brokerage office and its 15 employees. Being located on the site full time has helped Jacobson better visualize what The Batture could become, he said.

# Not your momma's riverfront

On Mother’s Day, that vision was reminiscent of the popular upscale resorts along the Florida Panhandle’s Highway 30A. Kids swung on a tire swing and played cornhole while parents sipped wine. Friends gathered at a picnic table to share barbecue and fried chicken from the food trucks. Others waited in line for the lobster roll, which was in short supply.

Though the crowd skewed young, there were plenty of grandparents and great-grandparents, too. Lifelong New Orleanian Carol Bienvenu, who grew up in the 1980s and hung out at the Fly as a teenager, said it was refreshing to experience a new side of the riverfront.

“We never really knew this was here,” said Bienvenu, who spent two hours picnicking with 12 members of her multi-generational family. “It’s beautiful.”

Bienvenu said she found out about The Batture from her 28-year-old daughter, who saw the Mother’s Day weekend being promoted on Instagram.

Jacobson said the popularity of the site with young families over the past two months has exceeded expectations. He plans to close after Memorial Day weekend for two weeks to make adjustments to the site, then reopen for a “Summer Series” beginning Father's Day weekend.

“We need time to retool to make the space more comfortable in the summer heat,” he said, adding that shade coverings, new furniture, sand and water features are among the changes in the works.

# Neighborhood angst

Jacobson said most nearby residents have been appreciative of what The Batture is bringing to the area. Davis said members of The River Triangle Association still have concerns.

In late April, the association sent a letter to the developers, asking for an opportunity to have more input on the “scope and scale” of the project. They said communication has been “intermittent at best” and again reiterated their request for a traffic impact study the developers have said is in the works but have yet to produce.

Sherman said, as he has in the past, that a traffic study is forthcoming and will be made available.

The letter also seeks more “transparency” about where The Batture is in the permitting process. It says, for instance, the association was not informed in advance about a special events permit The Batture secured to host a gathering during the Masters golf tournament, which featured a floating putting green on the river.

""We're almost always surprised by what is going on out there,"" Davis said Friday. ""Whether it's a yacht showing up for Super Bowl or a putting green in the river.""

The problem, he said, is not a legal one at this point but about ""community relations"" and trust.

Sherman counters that the developers have made themselves available to anyone who wants to talk to them.

""We have started weekly coffee meetings at The Batture and invited everyone to come,"" he said. ""Last week, only one person showed up.""

Even in class or at work, I’ve asked the same thing multiple times and been completely ignored — like I’m not even there. It’s not always hostile, it’s like I’m just not registering to them. And that feeling stays with me — the embarrassment, the hurt, the loneliness.

I’m autistic, and I’ve come to terms with that — I understand now why I am the way I am. But what’s hard is knowing that I’m constantly being overlooked, and most people don’t even notice they’re doing it.

I don’t want anything big from people, just to be heard. To be responded to. To feel like I exist to them. But most of the time, I feel like I don’t. And it’s exhausting.

This isn’t just another meme coin — Kendu has evolved into something bigger. Binance recently called it “the brand coin of this cycle” (https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/24204221029657), and it’s not hard to see why.

2. How old were you when you were diagnosed? Also, what did you do to prepare for your evaluation?
3. How has getting diagnosed at this point in your life changed your life, for better or worse?

I suppose I should give some background information about myself. I (20M) am not formally diagnosed with anything at the moment. However, I have been strongly suspecting ADHD for the past 3-ish years and off and on suspecting autism for the past 5 years. The reason I say ""off and on"" with autism is that I didn't have my ""a-ha!"" moment with autism the way I did with ADHD until literally just 2 months ago.

To keep it short, I spent a really long time just shooting down the possibility of being autistic because of specific signs/symptoms that I either:

* didn't know were signs of autism. For example, I have a particular passion project that I have devoted probably hundreds of hours into at home, and I always seem to enter a state of hyperfocus whenever I'm doing anything with this. As in, I will completely lose track of the time and it almost feels like I can't stop. Also, I used to have a very stereotypical view of what stimming is, so I thought that rhythmically flexing my calves or clicking my teeth to the beat of Radio Brain (a.k.a. the songs stuck in my head at any given moment) wasn't stimming. These are both stims I learned very quickly in school after being told to not hum in class. As far as I'm aware, I never really did any hand-flapping or other stereotypical stims as a young child, but that's something I'll have to ask my parents about.
* didn't notice in myself. It took someone else pointing out to me that I actually suck at eye contact. In my own head, I thought I was doing pretty okay with it, but I was wrong. This same person also pointed out that I will sometimes walk off in the middle of a conversation to do something else. In my mind, I thought the conversation was over and that the other person had already said their piece and I had nothing more to say, so I thought I was in the clear to leave.
* outright didn't think I did. A very strong example of this is my tendency to withdraw when I'm overwhelmed/overstimulated. I always thought this was just a manifestation of stress, but now I know that typical stress doesn't cause someone to only be able to mumble simple phrases and feel like their head is full of fluff and the world is spinning in circles. I kinda exaggerate the last part, but I seriously didn't know for the longest time that yes, I do become overstimulated and I know what it's like to have a shutdown. As for meltdowns, I'm not sure if I've had more than maybe a few in my entire life, but I definitely notice in myself a tendency to become crabby and agitated when my routine is disrupted. I don't tend to follow a set daily routine (hello, undiagnosed ADHD), but I definitely have specific rituals around certain parts of the day. For example, the first thing I do when I get out of bed is I throw on a pot of coffee and take my vitamins while my coffee is brewing. However, before I can take my vitamins or have my water, I always immediately go to the bathroom and check my weight right after (gotta get the most accurate measurement), but there will be hell to pay if someone else has to use the bathroom while I'm in the middle of my morning routine. Over time, I've learned to grumble in silence when this happens, but it still bugs me to no end!

There's definitely other autistic traits that are more plainly obvious in my opinion, but these are the ones that I had to analyze really closely in order to make sense of them and realize that these are, in fact, autistic traits when you group them with everything else about me.",3,1747682148.0,aspergers,4,1.0,False

A quick turn from the camera to show the rhino almost tripping on its own feet moving so fast. This reveals a man holding on to the rhino's tail being dragged along the dirt.

Eventually the man climbs on to the rhino's back and grabs onto the rhino's horn and almost effortlessly swings and pushes it to the ground.

though can you tell me why you're asking me instead of your parents or another teacher?

well they always just say that I should ignore them and they'll eventually stop but…

Peter 
he yeah that never works. At that point you're basically their punching bag.

Nate
 exactly! So what should I do?

Peter 
so instead of doing nothing, do something, while obviously don't instigate if it's just insults, just act as if it doesn't bother you, maybe laugh, just show you don't care. And if you're feeling brave, a comeback never hurts.

Nate smiles and cheers up. He opens his shoulders more standing proud

hey if you're alright telling me, who are these kids bullying you?

Nate

Spider Man then has a fierce battle with the 5 robbers with them all attacking him one at a time with their weapons.

They use their tech as gauntlets to punch spider man. He doges them but then does get hit by one of them. He gets sent flying into a wall.

Spiderman
I guess reality did hit me in the head

Spiderman then webs on to the weapon and doges the attack as the guy tries to punch him again

Spiderman: that's some advanced tech, mind if I take a look

Spiderman the pulls the weapon of of the guys arm and while swinging it hits the another guy in the head

Spiderman
oh sorry wrong guy, that was meant to be payback my bad

2 thugs go after Spiderman to try and overpower him so they go on opposite sides

Robber 2 
try and dodge this

Spiderman: 
ok

 They try and hit Spiderman but his speed and reflexes prevent them from being able to catch spiderman

Spiderman
 you know what I've enjoyed hanging out with you guys, really I have but I think it's about time that I go 

Spiderman then knocks out there remaining robbers and webs them up

Just then Spiderman sees one more robber leave the building with his hands up

Robber 3 
hey look man just tie me up or whatever 

Spiderman
damn a volunteer that's new

Robber 3
yeah well even prison is better than staying in the streets with this psychopath running about 

Spiderman
psychopath, what are you talking about 

Robber 3
some guy in a lion costume is going about fighting people saying he's after something ‘worth the hunt’ whatever that means

Spiderman
 to himself great that's all I need now

The cops come 

Spiderman
 leaving hey guys I got you a present.

A police car drives to the scene with there siren's on
2 officer get out of the car

Officer 
thanks spiderman, wow even the small time crooks have tech now, that's new

Spiderman
 even stranger is apparently some guy is going about hunting humans 

Officer:
what?

Spiderman
 I'm as confused as you are.

Officer
should we warn the public 

Spiderman
 that's for you to decide but hopefully he's just another nutcase in a weird costume 

Officer
 don't worry we'll look into it

Spiderman
 alright I better be off then. And don't be late next time alright.

Spiderman swings away. However as he swings the camera pans to the top of the building where Kraven sits watching the whole event while sharpening a wooden sphere

1kqkck6,https://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/1kqkck6/question_about_scedison_planned_maintenance/,Question about SCEdison planned maintenance,"Hello fellow power consumers, recently got a power outage due to maintenance that went over the stated timings in the letter, which were 8 AM-5 PM. Power was restored around 7 pm but I was left disappointed because I work from home everyday (office is 7 hr away in San Ramon) and I've never gotten such a long maintenance outage in the 12 yr or so I've been paying a power bill. Going back to my past, I had PG&E and I don't recall them doing a planned maintenance over 4 hr. Anyway, the result of not having power was that I had to work in 3 different coffee shops during the day and grab lunch. So, I submitted a claim of $60 which I admit is small amount in relation to all the other things going on in the world. But I thought it would easily be accepted because there is an obvious problem in how they plan their Maintenances (I.e. what's the company policy towards the amount of hours you can do any given Maintenance ?).

So fast forward to now I got a letter which looks like a copypaste apologies letter that they send out to any customer who submits a claim to them. Claim denied. I was wondering if someone has more info on how they give out reimbursements for going over maintenance windows? And if anyone has had luck in checking policy towards equipment maintenance? I live in a HOA in Lake Forest and they were working on a large power station next to the sidewalk on that day, just to give some context.

1kqkc29,https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLM/comments/1kqkc29/introduction_and_request_for_sanity/,Introduction and Request for Sanity,"Hey all. I'm new to Reddit. I held off as long as I could, but ChatGPT has driven me insane, so here I am.

My system specs:

* Renewed EVGA GeForce RTX 3090
* Intel i9-14900kf
* 128GB DDR5 RAM (Kingston Fury Beast 5200)
* 6TB-worth of M.2 NVMe Gen4 x4 SSD storage (1x4TB and 2x1TB)
* MSI Titanium-certified 1600W PSU
* Corsair 3500x ARGB case with 9 Arctic P12s (no liquid cooling anywhere)
* Peerless Assassin CPU cooler
* MSI back-connect mobo that can handle all this
* Single-boot Pop!\_OS running everything (because f\*#& Microsoft)

I also have a couple HP paperweights (a 2013-ish Pavilion and a 2020-ish Envy) that were giiven to me laying around, a Dell Inspiron from yesteryears past, and a 2024 base model M4 Mac Mini.

My brain:

* Fueled by coffee + ADHD
* Familiar but not expert with all OSes
* Comfortable but not expert with CLI
* Capable of understanding what I'm looking at (generally) with code, but not writing my own
* Really comfortable with standard, local StableDiffusion stuff (ComfyUI, CLI, and A1111 mostly)
* Trying to get into LLMs (working with Mistral 7B base and LlaMa-2 13B base locally
* Fairly knowledgeable about hardware (I put the Pop!\_OS system together myself)

My reason for being here now:

I'm super pissed at ChatGPT and sick of it wasting hours of my time every day because it has no idea what the eff it's talking about when it comes to LLMs, so it keeps adding complexity to ""fixes"" until everything snaps. I'm hoping to get some help here from the community (and perhaps offer some help where I can), rather than letting ChatGPT bring me to the point of smashing everything around me to bits.

Currently, my problem is that I can't seem to figure out how to get my LlaMA to talk to me after training it on a custom dataset I curated specifically to give it chat capabilities (\~2k samples, all ChatML-formatted conversations about critical thinking skills, logical fallacies, anti-refusal patterns, and some pretty serious red hat coding stuff for some extra spice). I ran the training last night and asked ChatGPT to give me a Python script for running local inference to test training progress, and everything has gone downhill from there. This is like my 5th attempt to train my base models, and I'm getting really frustrated and about to just start banging my head on the wall.

If anybody feels like helping me out, I'd really appreciate it. I have no idea what's going wrong, but the issue started with my LlaMa appending the ""<|im\_end|>"" tag at the end of every ridiculously concise output it gave me, and snowballed from there to flat-out crashing after ChatGPT kept trying more and more complex ""fixes."" Just tell me what you need to know if you need to know more to be able to help. I really have no idea. The original script was kind of a ""demo,"" stripped-down, 0-context mode. I asked ChatGPT to open the thing up with granular controls under the hood, and everything just got worse from there.

1kqkann,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kqkann/what_should_i_do_about_my_friend/,What should I do about my 'Friend',"okay so never made a post so im sorry if this is a bit rocky and i struggle a lot with grammer and spelling so i apologise in advance. 

For some context me (17F) and my friend 'Taylor' (17F) not her real name have been friends for about 4 years. we got realy close and i called her my best friend for a long time. about a year ago i started to find some issues in our friendship. It was mostly just minor things but i started to relise just how maney small things there actualy were. I relised that she never enitiated any type of contact exept if she needed somthing from me. For example asked to come to mine to dye her hair which i did. 

After a while i desided to text taylor about how i was feeling just so she knew what she was doing becuse if she dident relise what she was going or how it was effecting me how would she know. For a few weeks after things seemed to be a lot better. the first big thing that happened was when taylor and her boyfrend daniel (fake name) broke up. She was really upset so i desided to try and chear her up so we made plans to do what she wanted to do and go to her faverout cafe my treat. We were going to do the next day (this was a few days after the brake up) The next day rolls arounf and i was about to head out the door when i relised that Tayor had texted me to cancel to go see her ot ex-boyfriend. I was upset but understood that it was her choice so i texted her hoping that she was okay and i hope everything was okay with her. she then spamms my phone trying to get me to respond before she calls me sobbing so i comforted her and we desided not to go out becuase i said i thought it wuld be better for her to have the day for herself. (i only bring this story up because it highlights some parts of the one sided friendship) i was upset about her cancaling when i was already on my way bceuase she knew i had things i canceled for the day just so i could see her (not sure what but think lunch with family).

This is now a long time after keep in mind and she no longer even cares about Daniel and has fully moved on but i cant remebr any important detales from this time. So more context we never attened the same school but saw eachother once a week for ballet but our instructor retierd so we had to find a new studio. we both ended up attending the same studio so again we see eachother once a week. so over this time the ignoring got BAD like i would text har and have her not anwer or reply for over a week and only recebve one work replyes. For some reson i checked and the last time she texted first (other than needing to borrow somthing) the last ltem she txeted first was over 2 years ago. 

  
I desided that i ouldnt deal with how i was being treated as even when we saw eachother she would barly speak to me. she also knew how i had strugled with menatl health and i told her before if she was anonoyed not to ignore me because it made me really stressed out. So i desided after weeks of worrieng over it to send her a long message detaling what she had done and how it was effeting me and how i barly knew her anymore (i was finding out basic things about her through mutual friends mentioning it) and how if she would rather not be friends than id like her to just get it overwith now rather than slowly replacing me with other people. we 'resolved' things when she called me and we spoke but she never acutaly acnolaged what she had done or aplogised but i desided to move on for it anyway. for a while things were better until earlyer this year when we hung out. Taylor sugests we meet in the city she lives in to get coffee together. So i get the bus in ater school witch takes about 30 inuats but no buid deel i wanted to see my friend. When i arrived she was already in the cafe (she told me because she dident want to wait at the bus stop) but when i got there she had already had her cofee and had a peace of cake to witch i thought was weird because she dident wait for me but i moved past it. the whole time we were there she spoke about things to do with her and i only managed to say about 3 things about how id been (we hadent seen eachother in 2 months) or just say an 'i see' to what she was saying. the few times i  did get to speak she was on her ohone sing if her parents woudl drive her home. i asked if we could got to the bathroom so we went over and when i cam eout she told me if she wanted a lifet she had to leave right now 9she only likes mabey a 20 mineut walk away in a very safe city that she walks ALL the time). We had only been together for 20-25 minets at this point. i was stuned buat agreed to walk her to her parents car but we got half way before i said i had to leave to get my bus back. I lied but couldent pretend it was okay anymore so left and got an early bus home. in total it took me more than double the time just travaling than what we spent together and it had cost me about $11 for the bus tickets. By the time i got home it was poring rain so i just walked home sobbing. 

  
Im really not sure what to do but im seeing her in a few days for the first time since and i dont know if i should say somthing or if im just overrectine to everything. has anyone ever gone though a similer situation?",1,1747681885.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1kqkaev,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1kqkaev/i_have_a_few_questions_for_the_latediagnosed/,I have a few questions for the late-diagnosed autistic people out there,"1. How old were you when you first started suspecting you might be autistic? What was it that made you start?
2. How old were you when you were diagnosed? Also, what did you do to prepare for your evaluation?
3. How has getting diagnosed at this point in your life changed your life, for better or worse?

I suppose I should give some background information about myself. I (20M) am not formally diagnosed with anything at the moment. However, I have been strongly suspecting ADHD for the past 3-ish years and off and on suspecting autism for the past 5 years. The reason I say ""off and on"" with autism is that I didn't have my ""a-ha!"" moment with autism the way I did with ADHD until literally just 2 months ago.

To keep it short, I spent a really long time just shooting down the possibility of being autistic because of specific signs/symptoms that I either:

* didn't know were signs of autism. For example, I have a particular passion project that I have devoted probably hundreds of hours into at home, and I always seem to enter a state of hyperfocus whenever I'm doing anything with this. As in, I will completely lose track of the time and it almost feels like I can't stop. Also, I used to have a very stereotypical view of what stimming is, so I thought that rhythmically flexing my calves or clicking my teeth to the beat of Radio Brain (a.k.a. the songs stuck in my head at any given moment) wasn't stimming. These are both stims I learned very quickly in school after being told to not hum in class. As far as I'm aware, I never really did any hand-flapping or other stereotypical stims as a young child, but that's something I'll have to ask my parents about.
* didn't notice in myself. It took someone else pointing out to me that I actually suck at eye contact. In my own head, I thought I was doing pretty okay with it, but I was wrong. This same person also pointed out that I will sometimes walk off in the middle of a conversation to do something else. In my mind, I thought the conversation was over and that the other person had already said their piece and I had nothing more to say, so I thought I was in the clear to leave.
* outright didn't think I did. A very strong example of this is my tendency to withdraw when I'm overwhelmed/overstimulated. I always thought this was just a manifestation of stress, but now I know that typical stress doesn't cause someone to only be able to mumble simple phrases and feel like their head is full of fluff and the world is spinning in circles. I kinda exaggerate the last part, but I seriously didn't know for the longest time that yes, I do become overstimulated and I know what it's like to have a shutdown. As for meltdowns, I'm not sure if I've had more than maybe a few in my entire life, but I definitely notice in myself a tendency to become crabby and agitated when my routine is disrupted. I don't tend to follow a set daily routine (hello, undiagnosed ADHD), but I definitely have specific rituals around certain parts of the day. For example, the first thing I do when I get out of bed is I throw on a pot of coffee and take my vitamins while my coffee is brewing. However, before I can take my vitamins or have my water, I always immediately go to the bathroom and check my weight right after (gotta get the most accurate measurement), but there will be hell to pay if someone else has to use the bathroom while I'm in the middle of my morning routine. Over time, I've learned to grumble in silence when this happens, but it still bugs me to no end!

There's definitely other autistic traits that are more plainly obvious in my opinion, but these are the ones that I had to analyze really closely in order to make sense of them and realize that these are, in fact, autistic traits when you group them with everything else about me.",2,1747681868.0,autism,1,1.0,False

The Idea That Possessed Me I thought: *what if I could get ALL important influencers with 10K+ followers... and keep their metrics LIVE. Like daily. Like a God-tier analytics tool.*  
So I looked into it and learned that: I’d have to **scrape 55 million profiles** (yes I said million like an idiot). Each one takes **3-5 requests**, sometimes more. You need **rotating proxies**, **bot stealth**, and **massive AWS muscle.** And oh yeah, **Instagram hates this** and might *smite you off the internet.* It’s like trying to sneak into a concert with 100,000 friends and hoping security just… doesn’t notice. Even with 100 EC2 instances, Smart proxies (shoutout Bright Data ).  Multi-threaded crawlers. It would take like **6 days**, cost around **$1,000–$2,000** PER RUN, and require me to monitor metrics **24/7** like I’m running NORAD. At this point I was literally budgeting my coffee vs. proxy spend and wondering how I got here. Looked into Modash, Qoruz, etc. Guess what? They *do* crawl and scrape... but **gradually**, **strategically**, and with lots of machine learning. Also... some of them probably have partnerships, or creators opt in. Basically, they do it *legally* (ish), and I was out here planning a digital heist like I’m the Instagram Phantom of the Opera.

# 🧍‍♀️ So What Did I Learn?

If you’re trying to build a creator database: Start small — scrape 5K–10K as a test. Use proxies, yes, but don’t get greedy. Budget like you’re building a SaaS, not robbing a bank. You *can* keep metrics live, but it’s $$$ and it’s HARD. Real ones are doing scheduled updates + using AI to fill in gaps

1kqk86x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/1kqk86x/b3tr_carbon_credits_exciting_future_opportunities/,B3tr - Carbon Credits - Exciting future opportunities with RWA,"I’d like to start off by saying that I have no affiliation with Vechain official, and can’t actually tell if this is their strategy, or was their intent. However, if it isn’t, they should definitely reach out to me, and give me a reward for being a genius.

So, let’s dive into it.

The VeBetterDao platform offers a plethora of opportunities. It also showcases Vechain as a L1 platform, and in my opinion, takes a more serious approach to what real, scalable adoption, looks like.

In alignment with their original company ethical values, the primary focus here is environmentally conscious RWA, made simple, profitable, and interesting.

Whenever Vechain issues B3tr, it costs them next to nothing. In return, the user must perform tangible actions, that mitigates their carbon footprint.

**An example from earlier today, is Bubbles:**

Bubbles has a max limit of 5 actions per day, for the sake of this discussion, we’ll use all of them. This means that a user may have 1825 actions per year, reducing their carbon footprint by 0.82kg CO2e per action - the assumption here is that the user would have used a plastic bottle as the alternative. Which, for the sake of the sale of carbon credits, is good enough. We’ll come back to that later.

A user can then generate 1.496 metric tonnes of carbon credits (CC) per annum.

Scale this up to half of this sub, and you’re looking at:

1.496m3 * 111700 =167 103,2 m³

These CC are valued at €70.39 (may 19 2025) per m3.

**The value created, just through Bubbles the dApp, then becomes: 167103.2 * €70.39 =€11 762 394,25**

What then about the other dApps.

An average tumbler has a carbon footprint (CF) of 1.8kg CO2e per use.

HangNDry now offers a profitable alternative. Rather than spend electricity on drying your clothes in a tumbler, you can now earn money on top of it, by being environmentally friendly.

The median is about 120 tumbler uses per year, per person. Let’s use the same numbers again, and we’re looking at 120 * 1.8kg CO2e = 216kg CC created per user. 0.216m3 * 111700 =24 127,2 m³ —> 24127.2 * €70.39 =€1 698 313,61

It all adds up, and it has an absolutely astounding revenue potential, that costs almost nothing.

In comparison, other companies are making big moves in selling CC’s, but there’s just not enough to go around, and no one has been able to truly tap into the consumer market. Because if you as a company sell less papercups or styrofoam cups with coffee, you’re losing revenue.

Tesla has had the sale of CCs as one of their largest revenue streams for years, and has been able to negate some of their worse losses because of a high OPEX.

Vechain can with a swift adoption rate, become the most used blockchain in the world, as well as secure a significant revenue stream, simply by making it interesting for the consumer to think about the environment.

The implications of the scale up of VeBetterDao are huge, and gives Vechain the possibility to initiate in industrial symbiosis projects, where CCs are the main pipeline, but can be built upon to sell supplychain and tracking solutions as well.

If they do it well, they can let companies build apps that enables the consumer to earn, save, (feel good about being environmentally friendly?) and interact with their go-to producers, as well as partake in the revenue generated by CCs. Vechain can then sit back, and collect basically royalties from this work.

I doubt it’s gonna be alot, but at current prices, I think a regular household, with 2+ users, can generate around $2-3000 per year.

For some, that will be negligible, for others, life changing.

What I find the most interesting, is the gaming aspect of it all. Using the apps becomes almost an obsession once you start. Since it’s all convoluted, yet intuitive, it requires near to no knowledge or experience navigating the software/app.",10,1747681724.0,Vechain,5,1.0,False

Nobody calls Zohran Mamdani a fringe candidate. Simply put, he is #2 in the polls because he’s smart, and the New York City system of allowing voters to rank their choices for candidates from 1 to 5 offers outsiders the opportunity to be real competitors.

Besides his special commercials, his promises to voters are unique—they are achievable. For example, he wants to open city-owned grocery stores in poor neighborhoods and offer the cheapest prices. A little more difficult to achieve but well within the mayor’s authority is Mamdani’s promise to make bus rides free. The mayor influences the MTA but only has the ability to ask, not order, free buses. On the other hand, the mayor controls the Rent Guidelines Board, and when he promises no rent increases, he can deliver. Mayor Adams, a friend to landlords, has allowed annual increases. The mayor before him, Bill De Blasio, froze the rent three times.

Mamdani is not the only Democrat supporting rent freezes for the 1 million New Yorkers who live in rent stabilized apartments. Five other candidates make this promise.

But Mamdani is the only one doing it with flair. Every New Years Day, the “polar bears” swim in Coney Island. This year, Mamdani joined them for a swim in his business suit and then boasted, “I’m freezing…your rent as the next mayor of New York City.” Choose your media—Tiktok, Instagram, Youtube—a picture of a wet and cold Mamdani reached hundreds of thousands of potential voters.

Most of the mayoral candidates issued a press release, but Mamdani turned it into a visual event and provoked the crucial question, “Who is this guy?” The latest poll has Cuomo at 53% once his second and third place votes are counted, while Mamdani is second at 29%.

The numbers require explanation. New York City fights the power of big money with two special election features. Public funding empowers small contributors to make big contributions. For every dollar an ordinary citizen contributes, up to $250, the candidates receive $8. A $50 contribution puts $400 into the candidates’ bank account. But it was still a surprise when Democrat Zohran Mamdani announced he was the first candidate to reach maximum funding limit. The primary election is from June 14^(th) to June 24^(th). The assemblymen from Astoria, Queens made his announcement on March 24^(th), months before the election.

Whatever the results of the mayoral primary, Mamdani reaches voters, a crucial skill in a democracy. He will be a player for the foreseeable future. His commercials attacking Eric Adams and Andrew Cuomo were the most riveting I have seen in decades. Two New Yorkers are having coffee. One of them pretends to support Adams by suggesting Turkey is a wonderful place. Turks reportedly steered money and gifted fancy airline seats to the Mayor, who urgently wishes the public will forget his corruption investigations. After needling the Mayor, the ad goes after Andrew Cuomo for shutting down mental health facilities at a time when mentally ill persons are linked to disruptive and scary incidents on the subway. Cuomo who fancies himself a frugal politician was willing to save money by denying services to the mentally ill.

The commercial is a direct hit against two prominent Democrats running for mayor, and then Zohran Mamdani sits down at the table and promises to be the best alternative. He wants rent freezes, public-owned grocery stores, fast & free buses, and universal childcare. It’s a dramatically different vision of public service.

This only makes sense if we understand that besides public financing voters have a chance to be heard, even if their candidate loses. Under ranked-choice voting, the city’s second pro-democracy reform, voters pick candidates 1 through 5. Even with 37% first choices, Cuomo must still get second or third place votes to bring him over 50%. A Marist poll found that the former governor would reach 53%. Mamdani had 29%.

The candidates are fully aware that the second and third, even fifth place, votes could decide who reaches the magic 50% and becomes the nominee. Mamdani’s most recent commercial is an eloquent plea for donations to the campaign of Adrienne Adams, Speaker of the New York City Council. She entered the race late and is short of funds. Mamdani said, “We are all running together to defeat Andrew Cuomo.” He was using his popularity to help Speaker Adams and stop Cuomo. It is a remarkable example of how the ranked-choice voting promotes Democratic Party unity and makes candidates short of funds credible. Before this system was established in 2021, it would be unthinkable for candidates to help each other raise money.

Mamdani demonstrates that ranked-choice voting (RCV) allows little-known candidates to become players in a Democratic primary.

Mamdani has received lengthy news stories describing his platform and recognizing his electoral strength. This would have been impossible without RCV.",3,1747681496.0,nyspolitics,0,0.71,False

1kqk4dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1kqk4dk/ai_skill_accelerator_easy_ways_to_level_up_your/,AI Skill Accelerator: Easy Ways to Level Up Your Creativity,"**Ever felt like your creativity hit a brick wall?** It happens to the best of us! One moment, we’re bursting with ideas, and the next, we're staring blankly at our screens, questioning all our life choices. Sound familiar? 

Let’s be real here—sometimes doing traditional brainstorming just doesn’t cut it. The pressure can be stifling, right? But fear not, my fellow creators! With a sprinkle of AI magic and some simple tricks, we can *kick those creativity blocks to the curb*. 🚀 

Here are a few easy ways to level up your creativity using AI without losing your unique spark. Trust me, it’s all about working smarter, not harder. Let’s dive in!

### 1. **AI-Powered Brainstorming**  
   - **Use AI tools** like ChatGPT or others for idea prompts. Just throw in your main topic and watch the suggestions flow! It’s like having a brainstorming buddy who never runs out of energy. 🎉
   - Feeling stumped? Ask them what you can do to approach your topic differently. “What if I looked at this from a kid’s perspective?” and boom—new angles.

### 2. **Content Remixing**  
   - Take a piece of content you love and mash it up! 🎵 Find inspiration from different genres and styles. What if you combined sci-fi with a classic fairy tale? 
   - Use AI tools to help create a draft or outline of your remix. You’d be surprised how just changing up the context can ignite new ideas.

### 3. **Visual Inspiration**  
   - **Platforms like DALL-E** can generate images based on text prompts. You can practically +create the visuals your imagination dreams up! 🖼️ 
   - Use the images as a springboard for your content. What story does this mystical forest invoke? A tale of adventure? Or maybe a career path for a great wizard? 

### 4. **Collaborative Creativity**  
   - Pair up with a piece of AI for writing sessions. You write a paragraph, and then let AI respond. It’s like having a chat with a buddy who’s always pushing you to think outside the box. 
   - Plus, you can challenge each other! “Hey AI, make my writing sound like Shakespeare on caffeine!” 🤔🍵

### 5. **Daily Prompts**  
   - Create a daily schedule for creative prompts. These can be random and wildly out there—""Write as if you're interviewing your pet about life goals.” It’s hilarious and *inspiring at the same time. 🐕🐈*
   - Tools like AI adapt to your style, so it feels like you’re refining yourself with every prompt.

### 6. **Reflect and Edit**  
   - Got something drafted? Use AI for editing. It can point out areas that may need a creative shake-up while staying true to your voice. Just like a supportive friend giving you feedback, but without the coffee breath! ☕😅

So, what do you think? Are you ready to supercharge your creativity with AI? There’s no right or wrong way to go about it—just find what works best for you. 

And hey, whether you’re here to brainstorm or dive deeper into your creative process, just know that it’s all about exploration and having fun. Let’s keep pushing those limits together! 🌍✨",1,1747681470.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I am currently on Instagram, FB, Tik tok. Most of my personal friends are on Insta and FB. Recently one of my friendships started falling apart and there is now a drift between us (that couple and my husband and I). I am trying to reconnect with her but it isn't working out. Both my husband and I have tried to reach out to them to meet up for dinner or do something but then they have other plans or can't commit. Recently I asked her to go out and coffee with me and another friend and she couldn't even commit to that but then I see her posts on FB where she goes on date nights with her husband or she goes hiking with some other friends. Naturally I understand that friendships change and some are not meant to be but everytime I see her posts now I find myself comparing my life to hers and thinking oh she's lost weight, or she is having fun or is doing this or that. I am now thinking I want to delete these apps from my phone. My conflict is that I like to use Instagram for tips/tricks from influencers. I don't buy everything from what the influencers show but whatever I have so far has been really useful. I also save posts on recipes that I try and just a whole wide array of information. I have way too many saved posts. I don't want to lose this information but then again I know if I keep Instagram I will most likely be viewing these friend's updates.

They offered us $200 in gift cards and a free 3-night stay just for sitting through a 90-minute talk. I figured it was harmless, and I was curious what the whole deal was anyway, so I signed up with my girlfriend.

The presentation started out friendly, nice lobby, free coffee, and a guy giving a smooth talk about “traveling smarter.” But halfway through, it got real salesy. They showed us these fancy resorts in Hawaii, Orlando, and NYC, and made it sound like you'd be saving thousands on travel. Then came the price: $20K upfront plus yearly maintenance fees. When we said we weren’t ready to spend that much, they brought out another guy with a “cheaper, one-time” option, but even that felt like a hard sell.

Puppy is relentless about pestering his 3 year old labradoodle brother, who will play for a while but then is clearly irritated and the play becomes less playful.  I’m trying to intervene and distract before things can start but it’s quite literally constant.

When he’s loose and not harassing our other dog he’s looking for trouble - surfing coffee tables, stealing laundry, chewing up books, anything he can get into.

Sometimes he spends a lot of time in his pen (in the main living area, we are nearby so he’s not isolated).  Chewing,  napping, rolling around.  I’m grateful for every second he will self entertain but sometimes worry we’re not interacting enough?

Am I over thinking?

We went through traumatic experiences throughout our relationship which led us to using and abusing the gas for almost 3 months consistently whenever we had money and or the time. We would binge at least twice for 8 hours out of the week. No joke on how expensive this stuff is and gets I would miss work just to huff can’t believe it and am upset. We never experienced loss of function in our legs or foots as other just general psychosis and delusions once in a while pins and needles in the feet that was when we were coming close to our end with that crap. Can definitely say I feel a lot better and every day gets better as the other group members say some days are harder than other not to mention my ig reels of people acting dumb with this stuff and the comments of everybody saying “dead brain cells” lol there are plenty of other things that also kill your brain cells not only that but they do indeed regenerate or new cells form. For weeks on end after quitting I was doing research and found out all the harm it does to your body and left me scared sh*tless I got blood test done and seen all the levels that they say out of wack. Been slamming b12 1000 mg daily take lexa pro here and there (not to much of a fan of pills lol considering n2o is worst) but what I can say is the first month was tough. Going through a derealization, feeling totally out of wack, and having mild cravings, not to mention the brain fog especially in the morning. Something’s I do notice different about myself after is being more sensitive but I think that’s just all in my head from the trauma of n2o and how toxic the relationship got. Racing heart rate that has slowed down significantly once I started using b12 1000mg daily working on changing my diet youd be surprised how much this contributes to your life in general without n2o so you can only imagine after n2o abuse. Stay healthy guys in general. I still get a racing heart rate when I wake up here and there not consistent tho am thinking it’s from the stress also had symptoms of tremors/twitch which significantly went down with time and less stress levels still get tremors every now and then but nothing like before. Am still able to run and do 100 push ups but am a lil shaky while doing them which leave me worried and scared at times as if I caused permanent damage still just thinking it’s all in my head cause not everyday or every moment I feel like that. N2o made me pretty insecure and in my head quite more and I can’t stand it I’ve been working on change but it has been tough hitting that mental shift. I feel like am still hanging on to things I use to do before n2o like drinking coffee everyday which I can’t now due to anxiety levels but been clean off caffeine for a while as well. Hobbies I use to do (im a mechanic and I specialize in German vehicles) which use a lot of my brain to conclude my diagnostics trouble shooting/problem solving still have managed to accomplish plenty of goals after the abuse. I even got a raise! From what I can say is yes there is worst cases out there and less severe ones but imo addiction is addiction none the less and am just thankful to be here sober and working on bettering myself. I was always hard on myself before the n2o so I tried to continue being like that with myself and just can’t be so harsh. You have to learn to love yourself and remove yourself from the negative cause there is plenty of it. Even if it means running, tripping on your shoelace, and scraping your knee. Learn to be you again and accept the change that comes with it definitely isn’t something easy but you are not alone and plenty of people who have succeed. (I like to watch the Steve o documentary) & the one with orylan anybody you see doing this bs just be harsh even if it means a slap across the face lol.

1kqjkbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/XXRunning/comments/1kqjkbh/ran_my_first_half_marathon_on_may_17th/,Ran My First Half Marathon on May 17th,"Hi all, I ran my first ever half marathon race on May 17th, Saturday, and would love to share the experience with you all! This is sort of also a documentation of my own journey, so feel free to skip down for the race part if it got too long for you.

**History (or the Lack Thereof) with Running**:

I was the type of kid who hated running (sprinting or distance) and never in a million years would I think I would start distance running. When I met a dear friend of mine in New York City ten years ago, she would encourage me to run with her along the Hudson River, but since I was so slow and sluggish, she would resort to walking with me. When she ran the New York City Marathon in 2017, I went to cheer for her but still did not grasp the gravity of her achievement but I was just so happy to meet up with her there, since we both moved away to different cities. She was the one who introduced me to Strava and I would still see her activities from time to time. Looking back, I think she was the one who planted the seeds in my head that running is cool and I should get into it one day. 

In the summer of 2024, I started swimming nearly daily to lose some pandemic weight at our town pool. It closed near the end of the summer, so I figured running is the next best thing to keep up with my daily activities. At the time I already achieved my pre-pandemic weight and restarted weight-lifting, so I was not particularly adamant on further losing weight, which in hindsight was a good move. I started running daily, and my original goal was just to continue to run a little bit longer, just a little longer, etc. I went from being able to run without walking for 15min, to 20min, and then to 30min. 30min was a huge milestone for me for some odd reason. Maybe the myth got to me that you can only start to feel the cardio effect of running after 30min. Then I kept going: 40min, 50min, 1hr! I remember I was so happy to have reached 1hr, which covered 5.91mi. Then I thought, if I could run 5.91mi without stopping, then I could do 6mi without stopping. Then on Oct 24th, I ran my first ever 10K distance. Looking back it was all very unstructured training. Everything was in positive splits and I wasn't particularly literate in Zone 2/conversational pace/pacing strategy, etc. But I have accumulated a bit of knowledge through vigorously reading through running subreddits and watching YouTube videos. Phily Bowden's videos were my motivator every time before a run. 

**Basic Stats**: 

My first 5K race was a turkey trot in my local town in November 2024. I vaguely remember my chip time was 31:xx which was quite an overperformance given how hilly the course was. 

My easy pace ranged between 11:30min/mi and 13:xxmin/mi. Never tested the lower end since that would break form. 

At the time, I thought running the half marathon in 2 hours 30 minutes would be a great achievement, so I arbitrarily gave myself an A goal of 2:27:xx (11:15min/mi).

**Training**

I was training with the Nike Run Club half marathon plan for \~60% of the time. I started the training maybe about 6 weeks earlier than the plan had intended, just because I was not sure whether it would work or whether I would have disruptions in between. The plan itself was okay and I was able to stick through it for maybe 80% of the assigned runs, but I did not like to have someone talk in my ears for the workouts. Long runs, I can just go for the distance. But to understand the structure of some the workouts, you have to at least start the audio for a few minutes. Plus, when I got to the tail end of the workout, it started the tapering phase, but I was still a ways from the race date, so I decided to switch to the Garmin daily suggested workouts (DSW). 

Garmin DSW worked quite well for me since it helped me further build a strong base. It also boosted my confidence in my pace. It at first assumed my base pace to be 11:15min/mi. I was like ""really? You have a lot of confidence in me."" But I did it with no problem. Then Garmin pushed up my base pace to be around 10:45min/mi. I did it for a little while and exceeded expectations again. Eventually Garmin assumed my base pace to be 10:35min/mi until a week before taper week. I think the temperature warming up and not having to run on icy roadds definitely helped my pace too.

That being said, it was a looooot of base training. Like many others have said about Garmin coach plans, it would change your workouts last minute based on how you did in the previous workout. I think maybe I had been running a bit faster than suggested pace, Garmin registered that I had run tempo for some of the base runs, so it would change the next speed run to base run again. Originally I was a little annoyed, but after I ignored a second base run and did my own speed workout one time (by creating a workout on the Garmin Connect app), I decided that that was too much mental work for me and I'll listen to the watch. 

I really enjoyed the base building aspect since that's what I lacked the most. I also wasn't too hung up on achieving a particular time goal, so losing a few speed workouts did not bother me that much. For some odd distances, I may go with Garmin coach plan again, but for half/full marathons, I might use some of the other suggested plans like Hal Higdon or Pfiz. 

**Nutrition**

If the runs are shorter than 1hr, I would eat 3 pieces of chocolates and drink a cup of black coffee. If it's longer than 1hr, I would eat a bowl of oatmeal with syrup and cinnamon power sprinkled, and drink a cup of black coffee beforehand. 

After runs, I would eat a bowl of plain yogurt + frozen blueberries + chia seeds + granola/pumpkin seed/flax seed mix. For lunch and dinner it just depends on what I feel like and what I have in the fridge. Sometimes I add a bit more protein shake if it's a lift day. 

**Pre-race Prep**

Taper week was quite stressful since my family was visiting me from a different country, and my job responsibility was taking up quite a bit of time, so while I wasn't physically taxed, I was mentally drained. However, I'd say I was quite lucky, since the weather was all quite clear until taper week, when it started to rain daily. I did fit some light workouts and my shakeout runs in but most of my training wasn't affected by the weather, which I'm very thankful for. 

Also, y'all, I FORGOT TO carb load. I should say though, ever since I started running, I've been craving for high-carb food, so my daily ingestions have been higher than pre-running. I did have a pretty good dinner with some food that my family cooked, but it just had normal carb content, not high-carb per se. I wasn't super worried since I have done a 13.1mi long run before without carb loading the night before and I was fine, but it was just funny to me how my mind went to some aspects of the race but not others.

**Race Day**

Woke up at 4:50am, made myself a bowl of oatmeal and a cup of black coffee. I got dressed, put my contacts in, and actually used KT tape for the first time since my IT bands have been bothering me a little bit. We arrived at the race starting location around 7:15am for bib and packet pickup. I started to feel a little nervous because everyone there looked quite fit. I wasn't expecting myself to be on the faster end of the crowd but I also did not want to be at the very very tail end. I just wanted to be decently slow but also show my training results. Seeing me nervous, my partner said to me again, ""you're racing against yourself, and any time you run today is a PB."" I started to feel better.

When the gun started, I was actually not that nervous anymore, since my brain was telling me: I have done this quite a few times, so this is just another long run. Looking back at the race photos, I was actually fiddling with my watch trying to get the pace pro plan to load, but I wasn't able to, so I gave up and just decided to run my pace. 

Having trained solo throughout the past few months, I wasn't looking to run with a pack, but still thought, if elites do it, there must be a reason, so why not? I found a girl in a pink top, really liked her pace, so I stuck with her. We never talked to each other or made eye contact, but I found that she got my plan and stuck with me too. We ran together for the first couple of miles until the first aid station, and she veered off to drink water. I decided to stay with my pace, since my ego was pushing for a time goal still. I sort of ran solo a little bit, passed a few runners that I was setting as my mini-milestones, and around half-way point, found a middle-aged woman in a white tank top. She was running very steadily and evenly, and I really liked her pace, so I decided to stick to her. That ended up being the right call. She was running mostly in the 10:15-25min/mi pace, and that would help me fall between my A and B goal, ish. On top of that, I started to feel the mental fatigue after I crossed the 8mi mark. This race was marketed as fast and flat, but there were mini hills sprinkled throughout the mid-section that it would drain you slowly, so sticking with this woman helped me a crap ton. I tried to speed up a little after we crossed the 10mi mark, since I wanted to adopt the {5 sec below pace goal for 1/3 of the race, being on pace for 1/3 of the race, and 5 sec above pace goal for the last 1/3 of the race} strategy. However, that was quite immediately disrupted by an uphill around mile 11.

As we crossed the 12mi mark, I decided that it's time to do a full send. I ran past this woman, and started running faster. My legs were okay, but mentally I just wanted to finish it. During the last 600-700 meters, I felt the time slowing down and was just thinking ""why is it not the turn to the finish line yet??"" I kept trying to motivate myself with seeing my family at the finish line and going to a seafood place afterwards. I tried thinking about the taste of lobster rolls, etc. Once I finally made the turn, I started sprinting. My watch told me I was probably sprinting in the 7min/min down to 6:24min/mi at the end, but watching the finishline video clip, I felt quite funny about that since I looked like I was jogging. I wasn't even looking at the big timer at the finish line but I just wanted to cross it and be done with it. 

Then I crossed it and saw my family and my dog. I had to walk quite a bit to calm myself down. I tried to stand still so that I could take my gear off and hand it over to my partner, but that immediately made my heart complain, so I knew I had to keep walking. Many runners said my dog looked so cute and was their motivator too along the course and it made my heart melt. After we walked towards the parking area, I saw a few people with bananas and I was like, ""I didn't even claim my free banana and bottle of water yet!"" So we walked back. They were also offering bagels, donuts, pizza and canned beers, but my stomach wasn't taking anything in, so I just took a banana and shared a bite with my dog. Second time around back in the parking lot, I saw a runner doing laps around those cars and was a little confused, but after I saw my weekly Strava mileage to be 29.80 miles, I got what he was doing (probably).

**Fueling**

I brought 6 honey stinger gels, each with 24g carbs, some potassium and some sodium. I was able to take three packs with 25min\~30min spread apart, but after the third pack, I could feel like I was burping the gel up, so I decided to just take gatorade from the aid stations from 80min onward.

I brought a hydration vest with a 1.5L bladder full of water, so hydration was fine. Racing day was 10-15 degree Celsius / 50-59 degree Fahrenheit. It was a tiny bit humid but didn't bother me that much. 

**Goal**

A goal: 2:15:xx, accomplished

B goal: 2:18:xx, accomplished (so same time as my longest long run)

C goal: 2:27:xx, accomplished

**Post-race Reflection**

* **Health**: Since I started running regularly, I started to feel more energetic and calmer. 
   * I feel very energetic every day, even my period days are better than pre-running. I used to feel cold with the tiniest temperature drop, but running somehow ""warmed up my core"" and I do not have to dress as much as before. I have a healthy desire for all kinds of food, and can trust my body / intuitions for nutritional balance. I am still lightly tracking my weight but not as diligently as last summer.
   * I have always been an anxious and high-strung person. Ever since running became my routine, it started to change. It grounded me to focus on my running form and the stride length, reflect on what each little niggle meant, and observe my surroundings on the run. I started to appreciate the little birds choosing to speed walk instead of flying away to avoid me, the squirrels doing acrobatics from one tree to another, and the horses taking a nap in front of the sign ""Do Not Disturb. They Are Not Dead."" I still stress out about the normal things that will stress me out, but the level is much more manageable.
* **Gratitude**: During the race, I felt the most alive I had ever feel. It was a genuine gratitude for being alive, on my two feet, trotting along. I also felt quite lucky to have a generally smooth-sailing training block. Despite some missed workouts due to schedule conflicts and/or bad weathers, I managed to complete 85-90% of the workouts. Overall, I think I'm able to start increasing running duration last fall quite easily due to my past health. I had been an active person for quite some years, despite some sedentary times. That might have provided me with basic health going in. On race day, I also encountered the ideal race weather. A little cooler at the start, but not warming up too much as we enter the late mornings. The sun mostly hid behind the clouds and only peeked through around mile 12.
* **Patience**: I had very little expectation coming into running, because I know I am average, athletically, at best. I know every little progress is moving in the positive direction. The training itself, especially in the dead of the snowy and icy winter taught me to be respectful of the weather and be patient. I saw somewhere in one of the running subreddits, that ""running is an honest sport."" You get what you put in. That comforts me quite a bit. As long as I put in the work, I'll see the result some way or another. 
* **Future plans for running**: I already signed up for another local 5K with my mom and a few friends. Another one will be a road race in August. Kofuzi said in one of the recent podcast interviews that he enjoys training more than races. I think that might be me too. I had a lot of fun during this race and felt super happy and accomplished after I crossed the finish line, but each little step of the way gave me so much more joy. I'd love to increase my weekly mileage and eventually run a full one day. 
* **Inspirations/Resources**: As this is getting too long, I'll just list them below:
   * YouTube:
      * Phily Bowden
      * Clayton Young - I was able to see him in person at the Boston Marathon half-way mark!
      * Ally Ostrander
      * Kofuzi
      * Ben Parkes
      * The Distance Project
      * Bandit Running
      * Jeff Pelletier (a trail runner, I know, but his videos are GORGEOUS)
   * Subreddits:
      * r/XXRunning 
      * r/beginnerrunning 
      * r/Marathon_Training 
      * r/running 
      * r/AdvancedRunning 
      * r/RunningShoeGeeks \- I will say though, there are a lot more men reviewing shoes on there than women and I'd love to see someone my height, my weight with my type of feet there some day (or maybe I'll post one day, who knows).
   * Running with Music (Rebecca Trachsel)
* **Gears**: 
   * ASICS Nimbus 26, Novablast 4 & 5, Superblast 5
      * Tried a run with Metaspeed Sky but decided to save it for a faster race
   * Shokz Openrun
   * Blender Sunglasses
   * Flipbelt
   * Hydration vest 
      * top search result on Amazon. I didn't do much research and it gave me a few chafing wounds on my back. May only use it for longer races or upgrade when I see fit
   * Garmin Forerunner 165
   * Calf sleeves 
      * hand-me-downs by my partner. I used them occasionally for other sports too

I need help deciding if I'm doing too much in my trip. I'll be travelling with 2 of my friends to Japan from 3rd to 19th November (including the days on a flight). I've included all the places I want to go and as I write this I'm sure I won't be able to cover all of these places everyday but I've added places which are kinda close to each other so that it's easier to reach them from one point to the other. Keyword being *KINDA* lmao. 

My interests: Museums, gardens/temples, walks with a view of the sea, cafes and food!. My friends and I won't necessarily be together all the time as our interests vary.

For food I'd rather not plan too much as I'd like to enter wherever looks good! Except for a few cafes I haven't added restaurants in this itinerary. 

The Itinerary:

3rd - Flight to Tokyo (Haneda) with a layover in Singapore. 

4th - Land in Tokyo at 6am and take the train to Ota-ku. (Very close to Kanagawa. Our trip will start from Kanagawa. 

- Yokohama Chinatown, Red Brick warehouse, Kishamichi Promenade, And some shopping in the area. Also wanted to try Ralph's coffee and Tsukikoya Specialty Coffee. 

- go to hotel at check in time. we'll leave our bags in a coin locker until then. 

5th - Kamakura & Enoshima
- enoshima aquarium and beach
- in kamakura would honestly just walk around and eat at cafes. today would be a chill walking day and wanted it to be impromptu. 

6th - Oiso
- meeting a friend here and will rent a private onsen for 3 hours at the Prince Hotel Oiso. Then visit the Oiso Connect Building for food and walk along the beach. 

7th - Mt. Fuji road trip.

12th - Road trip to Okayama (about 2 hours by car)

✅ Scraped over **50+ roasters** and **200+ coffees**  
🤖 Used LLMs to extract tasting notes, roast level, bean type, processing method, and more  
🧰 Built a pretty intense backend using Python, Crawl4AI, and Supabase (for the nerds here :P)  
🙌 Still struggling with some of the backend scraping work, any help is more than welcome!!  
🎯 **Frontend rebuild now underway**

# 👀 What’s coming next?

* Full roaster + coffee **directory with filters**
* **Profiles for roasters and Individual pages for coffee products with links to purchase**
* Filter by **roast level, bean type, brew method, price range, region, flavor**
* Plans to add **favorite tracking, reviews, comments and a lot more!**

# 💬 I'd love your input:

* What filters or features do *you* wish existed when buying Indian specialty coffee?
* Would a “coffee matchmaker” tool help?
* Any roasters I might have missed?

She is a girl who works at the same place as I do.  
When we first met, she started joking with me and flirting.  
We usually have coffee together during our work break.  
One afternoon, I asked her what she was doing that evening, because I was planning to ask her out, and she replied that she was going out with her friends. From that moment on, she started acting strangely.  
The next day at work, I kept things very professional—I’m her superior—and she seemed annoyed. I noticed she kept glancing at me out of the corner of her eye and trying to draw attention to herself.  
When I asked her to have coffee together, she agreed right away and used the opportunity to ask me if I was upset in any way, since she thought I had wanted to ask her out and that her answer might have stopped me.  
I told her I wasn’t, and she got a bit “restless.” She kept insisting that I must have taken it personally, started looking at my lips, and couldn’t maintain eye contact.

We saw each other again at work the next day, and once more I maintained a very professional attitude toward her. She started flirting with me again every time she saw me in the hallway, hoping I would talk to her about something not work-related.  
I asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee, and she said she didn’t feel like it.

I see myself in Demi unfortunately. I think I have dealt with this same complex. It takes self awareness to fix. I hope that she can see how her behavior is not OK. I think Taylor was right to call her out for being fake and betraying her ""best friend"" Jessi.

Also, I think we should give everyone grace because people are nuanced and shaped by the environments they were raised in. I don't like how harsh Demi is about Taylor and how she speaks to her mom Liann. Demi needs to stop believing she is so special and God's gift to this Earth. You may have been a fan favorite in season 1 for your beauty and being a ""voice of reason"" but this season the truth comes out about your true character. Humble yourself. You knew this show involved Taylor and all of her immaturity, pettiness and drama when you signed up for it. If not, a quick glance at Taylor's Tiktok will reveal who she is and what she's about. It's a bit disingenuous to now to think you can kick her out as the main character because you think you're a better main character.

Demi's redeeming qualities are also her downfall. She speaks authoritatively and has strong opinions on what other people are doing. But I believe her opinions are too harsh and her thinking too rigid. She will always be a supporting character. Unless she's willing to get more vulnerable and share more of her life story.

I’m in my early 30s, 5'3"", currently 143 lbs with a goal of getting to 130–133 lbs for now. My weight usually always stays between 135-145 and haven't been 130 or below in a long time whereas in my 20s I usually stayed between 120-130 ish. I dont get too hung up on the number but just as a data point for what my goal is i thought i'd include. I’ve tried calorie tracking through MyFitnessPal and Cronometer. I usually do well for a few days or a week, but then I fall off—either because I start estimating everything or I get into late-night snacking and just stop tracking altogether.

A few things I’ve noticed about my habits:

* I always have morning coffee (Nespresso with Chobani sweet cream) and usually eat breakfast—something like eggs with spinach or a breakfast burrito. I try to include protein and greens in each meal.
* I sometimes worry about eating “too much bread” because I see others cutting it out, but I’m not really low-carb.
* I struggle with consistency. If I miss lunch, I’ll often eat more at dinner, and then snack at night even when I’ve had a full meal.
* I’ve tried increasing calories at dinner to avoid snacking, but the habit often sticks.
* I aim to walk daily and even bought a walking pad so weather isn’t a barrier. I sometimes struggle to get up and do it. The 10k steps usually takes me 1.5 hours. Trying to get better about knowing I don't need to get it all in in one fell swoop.

Three months ago, I set a goal to lose 6–12 lbs by my birthday… but I ended up gaining the 6 (from 136 to 142ish). It feels like every time I focus on weight loss, I somehow self-sabotage or overthink it.

# What I’m hoping to learn from you all:

* What small, realistic changes helped you stay consistent with tracking and actually stick with it long enough to see progress?
* Do you use go-to meals or calorie “templates” that keep things simple and remove decision fatigue?
* How did you handle snacking or night eating, especially if it was more out of habit than hunger?
* How did you stop overcomplicating or psyching yourself out once you committed to a deficit?

I really want this next attempt to be rooted in consistency and mindset, not perfection or restriction. If you have any insight, personal stories, or tips that worked for you, I’d be so grateful.

1kqjbx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/1kqjbx7/my_experience_so_far_using_a_13_air_as_a_laptop/,"My experience so far using a 13"" Air as a laptop replacement","So for context, my current macbook was over a decade old, and it was at the point where the issues were piling up to where I knew it was time for an upgrade. My laptop usage is mostly for things like using web apps, software development, 3d modeling, and gaming. Then it occurred to me as I was researching my options, that all those use-cases can be done on an iPad.

* Web Apps are a no brainer, just open safari and run them. And in fact there are native iOS apps of most of the web apps I use most frequently use, which is actually better
* Software Development would normally be a deal breaker, but I'm lucky here in that I develop using using purely CLI based tools, and already generally prefer to SSH onto my homelab for personal projects, and am **required** to SSH onto my work laptop instead of developing locally for work.
* 3D Modeling was a tricky one, but I found a 3d modeling app that is designed around the apple pencil that is actually excellent for my use case (mostly just relatively simple functional 3d prints for around the house). I won't be deleting my onshape account any time soon for the **really** tricky work, but onshape also works fine via the web for when I need the added complexity (they technically have a mobile app, but it's inferior to the native iOS solution I found)
* Gaming would also be a deal breaker for many, but I am already in the habit of using moonlight/sunshine to stream games from my gaming PC. And frankly the world of iOS gaming is actually starting to become pretty decent. Civ VI plays great on the iPad, as does X-Com, Total War, and Divinity. And of course there's loads of designed-for-mobile games like polytopia for more casual sessions.

So I decided to take a bit of a leap, and went with a 13"" ipad air M3 with a magic keyboard and apple pencil pro in lieu of an iPad air. I've had it for about 2 weeks now, so I thought I'd share my thoughts so far in case anyone else is thinking of doing something similar, and I plan on posting another update in a few months once I've got some real usage under my belt

## As a tablet

**The Good**

 * The Apple Pencil is fantastic. 3d modeling on the iPad is so much more enjoyable than on a computer. It feels like a much more organic process, and much less like a chore. I've also been playing around with drawing and it's been a lot of fun, despite my complete lack of skill
 * Tons of screen real-estate make touch oriented games a blast, and allow me to stream games with lots of UI components like FFXIV without straining my eyes
 * I find the onscreen keyboard to be very comfortable and natural to type on thanks to the size. I was surprised at how well I could type without even having the magic keyboard connected. I often find myself doing pretty complex tasks without having the keyboard attached. When I first got it, I imagined that anything vaguely productivity related would require the keyboard, but that turned out to be untrue
 * Fantastic as a cooking companion, the tablet case I use let's me stick it on the fridge with the recipe open so that i can reference it hands free as I go about cooking
 * Paired with Forscore, it's become an excellent tool for practicing music, it's pretty much the exact dimensions of a standard sheet of paper, so it feels incredibly natural to read sheet music off of it.



**The Bad**

 * The screen is great indoors, but outdoors it's lack of OLED shows, using in direct sunlight is pretty much impossible, even in indirect sunlight it's unpleasant. This is the one area where i find myself wishing I went for the pro, but I don't have enough of a desire to use it outdoor to justify the additional $500 it would have cost
 * The 13"" is big, which is great for getting shit done or playing games, but it can be unwieldy at times, it's not a tablet you want to be holding up for long periods of time, but one you prop up to use. I often find myself still reaching for my ipad Mini for flows like scrolling the news while sipping coffee. And similarly, I've found that I prefer using my mini paired with a snap on controller as opposed to using my air with a wireless controller, the increased flexibility and comfort outweigh the benefits of a bigger screen. But for playing touch-oriented games, I definitely prefer the air.


## As a Laptop

**The Good**

 * The magic keyboard's keys feel great to type on, the trackpad feels like a ""real"" laptop trackpad, which is great. I'm trying to train myself out of the habit of using the trackpad for mouse-heavy tasks though and use the touch screen instead, but it's nice to have for scenarios where that works better. And with the magic keyboard, I can use it as i would a laptop on a couch, which is my primary usecase for using it in ""laptop"" mode
 * The 13"" screen makes stage manager feel very comfortable, I don't think I'd like Stage Manager at all on an 11"" due to the ""wasted"" screen space

**The Bad**

 * The magic keyboard's keys and trackpad may be great, but that's not to say it's perfect.. My biggest gripe is that the magic keyboard makes your ipad unusable as a tablet without removing it entirely. Just the ability to fold back would be such a boon to it's usability, but as it is, if you want to use your ipad as a tablet, you pretty much have to remove it. The flow of removing it from the magic keyboard and putting my magnetic case back on isn't **that** onerous, but it makes switching flows much more of a pain than it has to be. And it means that when traveling with my iPad, I have to effectively bring two cases.
 * I get the impression that my opinion of Stage Manager is significantly more positive than that of most folks here, but even I agree that it needs a lot of work before it can actually compete with MacOS. I've heard rumblings that we might be getting some improvements in 19, so fingers crossed
 * I have to take at least one bullet point to acknowledge that most of the reason I can use an iPad as my laptop, is simply because i have other hardware in my house that can pick up the slack. If I didn't have a home server to SSH into, I wouldn't really be able to use my laptop as a Software Development Machine (in the way I prefer at least). If I didn't have a gaming PC to stream from, I wouldn't be able to play more than a couple ""real"" games on it.


## Summary

It has to be said that it is **not** a fully functional laptop, but if your requirements for your laptop are relatively light, like mine are, it can absolutely function as one. I think the biggest draw to going this route is the simple fact that in using an iPad as a laptop, you also get the best tablet available today in the bargain. I've been generally keeping my air in my sling bag wherever I go, and it's much more comfortable to take out in a coffee shop or a friends house than a laptop would be, but I enjoy knowing that I'm not leaving any functionality at home by just bringing my tablet. Ultimately I find myself using it as a tablet much more often than I find myself using it as a laptop, but that's more because I've found that most of my day-to-day tasks really don't need a laptop, and are much more comfortable on a tablet",1,1747679654.0,ipad,1,1.0,False

1kqj7jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charleston/comments/1kqj7jl/4_and_12_day_itinerary/,4 and 1/2 Day Itinerary,"Me and my boyfriend just got back from a long weekend at Charleston and figured we’d provide our itinerary for anyone who is looking to go out there soon! We noticed that the linked itineraries in the Visitor’s Guide are pretty old so didn’t know if anyone would be interested in a fresher one!

Wednesday
- Arrived around 3:30, checked into our hotel (Fulton Lane Inn), and unpacked. The hotel has free wine and cheese from 5-6, so we partook and then went to Leon’s Fine Oyster and Poultry Shop. Honestly one of my favorite meals we had!! We both had fried chicken. Boyfriend ordered oysters, and then we got the scalloped potatoes and cucumber salad. We split a Grasshopper for dessert. All of it was fantastic, my favorite was the cucumber salad. They don’t take reservations so prepare to wait.
- We went to The Rooftop at the Vendue for drinks after. I liked the drinks but we had a sort of crappy experience with one of the bartenders that left a sour taste in my mouth. Overall good experience though.

Thursday
- Before the beach, we went to Bitty and Beau’s coffee. We were not fans - it was very expensive and my coffee was gross. I didn’t even drink half.
- Went to Sullivan’s Island basically all day. We figured going on a weekday would be less busy and we made sure we got there before 10. Parking, we heard, can be a bit hard if you go on the weekend or later in the day, which we noticed because at lunch, parking lots that were empty when we got there were completely full.
- Around lunch we went to The Obstinate Daughter and we really liked it. I got The Rutledge pizza which was really good and boyfriend got the Shrimp roll.
- Went to Le Farfalle for dinner and it was absolutely amazing. Definitely make reservations. For an appetizer we got the rosemary focaccia; for entrees we got the chicken parm and fusilli lunghi. We also got bread pudding for dessert and it was soooo good.

Friday
- Got coffee at Second State. Honestly another forgettable coffee experience. We didn’t have much luck in this department.
- We went to the city market for an hour or so which we did enjoy. It’s huge and there’s a lot of handmade, unique gifts. I got a shirt, and some jewelry, and boyfriend got some spices.
- Walked to Liberty Square to ride ferry to Fort Sumter. From our hotel, it was a 25ish minute walk and we regretted not driving. It was super hot, over 90, so definitely a mistake on our part.
- If you like history or just want to see something new, I would recommend it. I wouldn’t say it’s something you should make time for every time you visit, though.
- On way back, we went to Ted’s Butcher Block. We both had the italian sandwich and it was pretty good. 
- Went to Oyster House for dinner. We both said it was our “worst” dinner we had. We originally were going to go to Fleet Landing but a few weeks before, we changed our mind and moved our reservation here. (We probably didn’t need a reservation but we had one). Our food wasn’t necessarily bad, but it wasn’t anything spectacular. I got lobster ravioli, and he got oysters (and an oyster shooter that looked absolutely horrendous), and a seafood trio that had scallops, shrimp and a different fish that we can’t remember.
- Went to Tommy Condon’s for drinks twice that day. Once before dinner because we had some time to waste, and then after dinner, we ended up going back. We tried to hit up a few bars recommended on this sub but they were all super busy. Examples: Blind Tiger, The Griffon, and another one that we can’t remember.
- We also got Gelato at Tinto y Crema and we didn’t really like it. It was basically melted when they gave it to us so kinda disappointing.

Saturday
- Got coffee at Mudhouse. Best coffee we probably had.
- Went to a farmer’s market at Marion Square, and then we went to the Joseph Manigault house. Our stay included a tour of a historic house and since we were right there, we toured that one. I would recommend it, we loved seeing it.
- Had brunch at Virginia’s On King. I hated mine but I ordered something new and just didn’t like it, I won’t blame the restaurant. Loved their mimosas and fried pickle okra! Boyfriend got shrimp and grits and really liked them.
- Our stay also included a carriage ride, which we did this day. It took us around some cool churches that we visited on Sunday, like Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist and the oldest Unitarian church in the city. 
- Had dinner at Edmund’s Oast which we both said was our best meal. Honestly the portions felt disproportionate to the cost - in a good way! We shared a massive caeser salad (honestly 4 people could easily split it, it was that big); I got the fried chicken with bok choy and a baked potato, and he got prime rib with crispy potatoes. We got tiramisu for dessert and it was heavenly. I didn’t like the drinks there much but boyfriend loved them. If you like beer, you’ll enjoy the drinks. They had probably 30 on draft.
- We did a ghost tour of the USS Yorktown to close out the night. I was honestly a bit disappointed but it may have just been me not understanding much about the tour. The whole thing was done with the lights on, and the guide didn’t tell very many true ghost stories. It just felt like a guided tour of a ship during the day. I didn’t have a bad time per se, it was still fun, but I wouldn’t do it again.

Sunday
- Had brunch at 82 Queen. It was fine - not bad but not outstanding. We both got fried chicken with biscuits and gravy.
- We did a little bit of shopping, and then checked out the two churches I mentioned before. The Unitarian had a gorgeous graveyard, and the Catholic Church was the most beautiful i’ve ever seen. Absolutely take a look if you go.
- Went to the Edmund’s Oast brewery and then the rooftop at Revelry. We liked both of them - boyfriend got a flight and said they were all good.
- Had dinner at Poogan’s Porch. I had been there before and remembered it being amazing, but we just left with a feeling of untapped potential. There were just little things off about our meal. He got meatloaf with potatoes and brussel sprouts and he said his potatoes were cold and the meatloaf was dry. I got the chicken and dumplings and it was good but not the best. However, the bread pudding was fantastic and we both loved it. We also got fried green tomatoes that had a sort of curry sauce with them, and honestly the sauce was the best part of those.
- We hit two bars: Doar Bros and Matador. I didn’t like either but it’s not a fault on the bars, I am very picky about my drinks and I felt bad from the meal I had at Poogan’s. Boyfriend enjoyed his drinks, though. I liked the vibes at both places.

Monday
- Checked out of hotel
- Went to Lewis Barbecue on our way out and honestly, fantastic! I don’t really even like BBQ but this place rocked. I got turkey and he got brisket. Definitely check it out!

This week I noticed when pre rinsing my filters there was some black flecks that showed up. I thought some coffee grounds had stuck to my lid at first and then thought it may be charcoal from my water filter. When it persisted I realized it was coming from the lid of my kettle.

After 10 years and countless brews my plastic lid has had enough. It is nearly completely disintegrated and has been flaking into my water for who knows how long. Replacement lids are cheap on Fellows spare parts page and I’ll get one on order this week.

Just wanted to let others know who might be trying to avoid drinking plastic in their morning brew.  It’s easy to unscrew the top knob on the lid to inspect the plastic underneath.

1kqj4kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kqj4kf/sp_one_zero_five_two/,[SP] one zero five two,"“I miss my husband” I sat crouched on the stairs peering out from behind the wall watching the man having breakfast at our dining room table. The man I married two years ago held a steaming coffee mug up to his lips taking slow short sips. On the other hand, he held a book, flipping a page occasionally. He didn't seem to notice I was there. He was just sitting there as if everything had been completely normal. The man gently set down his mug and brought his elbow to the table to rest his head on his hand, looking away from me. The spread of food on the table was now cold. He had been waiting for me to come downstairs for almost 20 minutes. I narrowed my eyes at him and took a deep breath, careful to exhale slowly. I didn't want him to notice me. He lifted his head from his hand and set down the mug leaning back into the chair he shook his head, the layers in his black brown hair swayed side to side before setting back down at the nape of his neck. I stared for a while longer, unable to find any inconsistencies. He definitely looked like my husband. Everything about him was right. His choice of coffee and pancakes. The way his eyebrows formed a slight frown as he stared at the book, even down to his stupid hair flip. He always flipped his hair like that. I stretched my legs in front of me and pressed down on the step with my hands. Maybe I was imagining it. I stared down at my legs. I had been known to be suspicious at times. The feeling that something was wrong was not foreign to me. This feeling and the events surrounding it had been a recurring theme in my life for as long as I could remember.

When I was ten I fell from a tree. My brother and I had been playing outside all day and decided to race to the top of an oak tree at the edge of our property. My brother being older had gotten the lead and I being desperate to catch up decided I would leap from branch to branch. I was about halfway up the tree when I felt my foot slip and suddenly I fell forward almost 12 feet down and landed on my shoulder, my vision went dark. My mom stood over me when I woke up, shaking me lightly. I looked around but I was laying on my living room floor. Apparently, I had taken a nap on the couch and fell. I never climbed a tree, and my brother had been at his friend's house all day. That was my mom's story, but that's not what really happened. 
Similarly, when I was 14 we picked up the family car from the shop. I commented how it was possible that the paint had faded so much making the once-black car appear navy blue. Apparently, it had always been navy blue. Except it hadn’t. 

It wasn’t until the night of my senior prom that I put everything together. At the dance, my then-boyfriend and I had gotten into a fight. I decided to call my parents, my dad picked up the phone groggily having just been dead asleep, and agreed to come get me. When I climbed into the car with my father, who had not managed to make it out of his pajamas, he asked if I wanted to talk. I didn’t, so for a long time we drove home in complete silence. I watched the road as the car maneuvered through the winding back roads, the darkness being lit up only by the car's headlights and the occasional dim streetlight. Suddenly what looked like a dog flashed across the street in front of us and dashed into the woods. My dad slammed on the brakes and the car came to a screeching halt. My dad insisted he had to get out and check if the dog was okay. He got out and walked out of my sight, past the range of the headlights into the pitch blackness in front of us. I waited anxiously, my eyes locked on the area where I last saw him, and after what felt like an eternity a figure emerged and strode quickly to the car. It was a man, this man wore my dad's dress shirt and pants with his lanyard and ID card around his neck. He made his way to the driver's side and got in looking at me. "" I guess it ran off, I didn't see it,"" he said. I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up, I wasn't sure how long or loud I screamed before realizing I could not breathe. My throat felt tight and I had to focus to take a deep breath. Throughout this, the man looked at me with a shocked expression holding his hands up trying to calm me, and finally he did. Once the initial shock wore off and I had a moment to compose myself, I realized what this meant. At some point in the day, I had made a choice either minor or major that had led me to swap realities. I was now in a dimension almost like my own where the only difference was that my father had worked late. I miss my dad. The real one anyway. I wondered, if I was with a fake dad, then was fake me with my real dad? Had she screamed seeing a man in pajamas climb into the car? Had she put the pieces together the same way I did? I hated this feeling.

It was this very very feeling that had motivated me to tell Alex of my fear of these alternate universes. The places that almost felt right if it weren’t for an unpleasant tinge of unease. I didn't know what caused these universe shifts and I was scared. The differences in these universes were never major. People always had the same jobs, same spouses, and same personalities. Usually, it was the placement of their furniture, a different mannerism, or a forgotten memory. A memory that should have been important enough to remain the same. Before we were married, I had explained to him my thoughts and together we established a way to determine whether one of us had shifted universes. A password of sorts, a sequence of numbers we would say to be sure we were still in the same place. Every morning sometime while getting ready for work I would call out the numbers to him and he would repeat them back to me. Every single morning, but as you can imagine today was the day our unofficial routine changed. 
When I woke up, he was already out of bed. I thought it was strange but heard him shifting downstairs and moving plates and silverware. I began dressing and fixing my hair in the mirror and called out to him. “Alex, one zero five two”, I paused and waited for his response “What?” Alex called back, except this wasn’t Alex. Alex wouldn't have said what he would have said one zero five two.A chill ran up my spine as my eyes began searching the bedroom. Everything seemed to be in its rightful place so I called the number a second time. The reply that came was a more high-pitched and drawn-out “what?” somehow stretching the word into two syllables. My heart sank into my chest and suddenly I felt very cold. Why was he downstairs anyway? We always made breakfast together. That was when I decided to tip-toe downstairs and look at who was in our kitchen. I’ve been sitting here since my eyes shifted from my legs to my shoes. The black flats I wore to work every day had scrapes and scratches all down the sides. They hadn’t looked like that yesterday? I worked in an office … how would I even get so many scuffs-
“What are you doing?” I jolted backward as a gasp escaped my throat. I wanted to scream and run but I was frozen in place. I stared up at the man before me, unable to breathe, my heart racing in my chest. “What's wrong?” he said looking behind him and then back at me. His expression was somewhere between worried and confused. “Why didn’t you say it back?” my voice came out shaky. He stared at me for a moment before frowning and lowering his chin. “Eleah?” he said while lowering himself to my eye level, “are you okay?”. His eyes scanned my face. “How do I know you're still you?” I said “If you don't say it back?” he tilted his head slightly and his eyes softened. “Is this about your reality shifting again?” he said, his mouth forming a slight smile. I studied his face, his pupils dilating as he stared back at me still smiling awaiting my response. This had to be Alex “What else would it be about” I said breaking eye contact. “Come on Eleah, I told you not to worry about that anymore. We are still here together in the same place we've always been.” He rose slowly to his feet, still facing me “Now come and eat or we’ll both be late.” I forced myself to stand up, keeping my eyes on the floor. That wasn’t the password, but at least fake Alex wasn't evil. 

I guess I could live with that. I had to anyway

One of those was freshly cut grass (which I found quite fast in a bottle of [Kate Spade - TRULYGracious](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Kate-Spade/TRULYgracious-47553.html)) and another was a freshly brewed coffee. Why would I not want to smell like the smell that I crave when I wake up every morning?

  
Knowing how multi-faceted a note can be, I decided to test and review 10 samples of perfumes built around a coffee note!

  
These reviews are based on an all-day wear, one spray on the wrists and two on neck/chest area. I reviewed all of these while working from home so cannot report on compliments/ longevity during a more ‘out and about day’. Comments on sillage relate to the strength of the smell within my own 'scent bubble'.

# Maison Martin Margiela- Coffee Break

**Notes:**

**Top -** Pepper, Orange Blossom, Patchouli

**Middle -** Lavender, Coffee, Milk, Tonka Bean, Siam Benzoin, Cypriol Oil 

**Base -** Vanilla, Cedar, Vetiver

I've had this on my 'to sample' list for a long time - I love lavender/vanilla combos (but hate Libre), lactonic notes and coffee notes.

The opening is definitely lavender-forward, it actually reminded me of [Elysium's Lavender Milk Tea](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Elysian/Lavender-Milk-Tea-90184.html) but less 'fuzzy', more clean and herbal.

The coffee note comes in after a couple of minutes, but very milky - a creamy sweet latte with a couple of sugars, maybe even a mocha, there's no chocolate note listed but the lavender/chocolate combo in [SJP's Covet](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Sarah-Jessica-Parker/Covet-1404.html) comes to mind.

This dries down to such a relaxing, warm, cosy scent - sweet milky lavender with a touch of coffee. The sillage is less lavender and more sweet milk and tonka - not really picking up on the base notes at all.

This is a lovely experience but the performance on my skin is frankly rubbish- I went to smell my wrist after an hour and it had completely disappeared. I had the same issue with [Afternoon Delight](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Maison-Martin-Margiela/Afternoon-Delight-95923.html). While longevity shouldn't be the most important factor to enjoyment of a scent, I feel like you are getting barely any bang for your buck here.

I used the rest of my sample as a bedtime scent (bit ironic for a coffee scent) and it had the desired affect! 

**6/10**

# By Killian - Black Phantom

**Notes:**

**Top -** Rum

**Middle -** Dark Chocolate, Coffee, Almond, Heliotrope

**Base -** Caramel, Sugar Cane, Sandalwood, Vanilla, Tonka, Vetiver.

There's so much going on in the opening - tonnes of rum and tonka bean, it's super strong and (imo) super, super masculine- there's a mas muskiness to this opening that weirdly reminds me of Lynx or equivalent spray enjoyed by teenage boys - NOT what I was expecting at all.

The drydown is still very boozy with a strong coffee note, some dark chocolate, while not as shocking as the opening, I would definitely say this leans very masculine. There's a note really bothering me and still giving me that 'Lynx' vibe in the sillage - maybe the vetiver? This isn't actually sweet at all to my nose, but it is powerful with tonnes of sillage.

Unfortunately I had to scrub this off an hour in - a huge disappointment for me! Giving the rest of the sample to my boyfriend as I'm sure I would love to smell this on a man!

Blind buyers beware - sweet caramel coffee with a dose of rum this is not!

**4/10**

# YSL - Black Opium Illicit Green

**Notes:**

**Top -** Pear, Fig Leaf, Green Mandarin

**Middle** \- Fig, Orange Blossom, Jasmine

**Base -** Bourbon Vanilla, Coffee, Patchouli

I'm not a massive fan of the original Black Opium but this flanker really intrigued me - coffee and fig sounds like it shouldn't work!

But it does! The opening is fresh, green and figgy, with a soft jasmine and fresh (not sweet) pear note.

The drydown is sweeter and far closer to Black Opium - vanilla and coffee but with a fresh edge that makes this a great spring perfume.

The coffee is in there, and I feel like it really shouldn't work with the fresher and fruitier notes but it absolutely does! It's sweet but not overwhelmingly so, it's fresh but still with a depth in the base which means the scent lasts. It's complex but not messy - it just works! Such a pleasant surprise. 

This beautiful perfume is apparently discontinued but still available at a lot of retailers in the UK.

**8/10**

# Montale - Ristresso Intense Cafe

**Notes:**

**Top -** Coffee, Red Rose

**Middle -** Roasted Coffee Beans, French Rose, Woodsy Notes

**Base -** Vanilla, Caramel, White Musk, Amber

Opening is super sweet jammy red rose backed with tonnes (I use this word too much) of caramel. The coffee note smells like chocolate in the opening, so sweet. 

The coffee amps up in the drydown - where a few spoonfuls of sugar are taken out of the equation. The sweet rose note is so addictive and strong. I am not a huge rose lover either! 

This is a huge performer - the sillage is rose and caramel whereas the coffee stays on my wrist. This effect lasted all day - I sprayed at 8am and this was still going strong when I took a shower at 9pm. One of the longest lasting perfumes I've ever worn.

I feel like I couldn't wear this regularly, but it's an incredible perfume. 

**7/10**

# d'Annam - Vietnamese Coffee

**Notes:**

**Top -** Coffee

**Middle -** Dark Chocolate, Condensed Milk, Lily of the Valley

**Base -** Tonka Bean, Amber, Cedarwood

As a lover of Vietnamese coffee and the condensed milk note in [Theodoros Kalotinis - Pistachio Latte](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Theodoros-Kalotinis/Pistachio-Latte-99550.html), I had high hopes for this.

The opening definitely has coffee- but it smells more like coffee grounds which I wasn't expecting, there's also loads of tonka bean which is adds a nice bittersweet edge.

This does sweeten slightly on drydown but there is something coming up which I don't like - the 'nice' bittersweetness turns kinda nasty - I actually feel like this smells a bit like tobacco smoke, and not in a good way at all.

It kept on getting worse as it developed - the coffee note felt dirty and bitter, with no sign of sweet, lactonic condensed milk.

I just didn't think think the smell on my wrist was that pleasant. Not a scrubber, but definitely not for me.

This does have has great longevity, I could smell this for a good 8 hours, but the stale coffee note just never went away. I see Vietnamese coffee (the drink) as a dessert, a treat, and there was absolutely no sign of sweetness or condensed milk in this.

**3/10**

# Teo Cabanel- Cafe Cabanel

**Notes:**

**Top -** Cinnamon, Coffee, Mandarin Orange

**Middle -** Butter, Milk, Heliotrope, Rose

**Base -** Caramel, Vanilla, Tonka Bean, Sandalwood, Musk

This is the most lactonic of the samples I picked and you can definitely pick that up in the opening - lots of cinnamon with the harshness you can sometimes get with that note softened and blended with a fuzzy milk note. 

Something I couldn't really pick up was the coffee. I am a fan of a 'dirty chai' - a chai latte with a shot of espresso, and this is what this reminds me of. The coffee in a dirty chai is overtaken by the milk and spices and leaves just a hint of flavour - this is what I am picking up here.

 I had to take a short walk to the vets on this day, and during my walk I REALLY picked up that butter note - I could smell cinnamon butter. It's the first time I've truly picked up 'butteriness' from a butter note so I would recommend sampling this to anyone who is curious about the butter note. 

This lasts a while too - a good six hours with good sillage. The problem is, I don't think I actually like the smell. This is one of these perfumes where it does deliver on the notes but I realise that I don't actually want to smell like cinnamon butter/chai latte with a touch of coffee.

I think this is a well-blended, interesting scent with good performance, but it just wasn't the scent for me.

# Floral Street- Ylang Ylang Espresso

**Notes:**

**Top -** Sichuan Pepper, Rose, Tangerine

**Middle -** Ylang-Ylang, Patchouli, Tiramisu, Jasmine

**Base -** Coffee, Cacao, Whipped Cream, Guaiac Wood

After testing and reviewing the [Floral Street discovery set](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1j6fkhl/floral_street_discovery_set_review/) I was curious about this scent (which wasn't included) so grabbed a sample knowing I wanted to try some coffee perfumes.

She's a MESS.

Opening is patchouli-heavy (the Floral Street's with patchouli notes seem to be so patchouli-dominant!) but, thankfully, it softens and fades pretty quickly.

The next phase is the tiramisu note - I picked this up pretty clearly among the florals, but this is such a messy blend. There's coffee, there's patchouli, there's florals and gourmand notes but they don't seem to be blending that well at all - it's not an unbearable stink, but the effect is a bizarre and off-putting.

I scrubbed after two hours.

# Theodoros Kalotinis- Coffee Addict

**Notes:**

Coffee, Caramel, Vanilla, Cacao Pod

The opening of this is a blast - so strong it made me cough! Sweet sweet SWEET coffee-caramel, this is the smell of a Starbucks latte with five pumps of caramel in it.

I'm not a overly sweet perfume fan, and I'm picky with gourmands but I actually absolutely love this opening - it's a maple syrup sweetness, something woody about it too. The coffee note is very realistic too even when mixed with the sweetness- it reminds me of a cup of Tim Hortons French Vanilla - one of the rare sweet coffee drinks I love. 

The coffee on my wrist is so strong that it almost smells like licorice. This is great mix of super dark and super sweet.

I think of all the perfumes I have sampled, this has the best of the 'coffee' notes - the coffee in here is so realistic and strong, it ALMOST smells burnt (hence the licorice nuance) - but this does calm down half an hour into drydown.

Despite the power of the opening, this doesn't last too long on my skin - very faint sweet coffee on my wrist 4 hours in. The first hour is so powerful that you may be thankful for the break! 

**7/10**

# Mancera - Amore Caffe

**Notes:**

**Top -** Coffee, Amaretto

**Middle -** Vanilla, Ice cream

**Base -** Brown sugar, Vanilla, Ambergris

The opening to this is VERY strong and boozy - it feels like I'm spraying Irish coffee on myself. The coffee note is strong and rich and definitely leans more towards strong freshly brewed coffee rather than coffee grounds.

The drydown is far softer and wearable - the coffee remains but it is softened with lots of vanilla and deep brown sugar notes. I think this does smell like an affogato, it's sweet but not too sweet, the coffee note is strong and lasts throughout but you can definitely pick up the sugar, vanilla and ice cream notes too.

This lasted 5 hours on me, I liked it, but again, I'm not really sure how often I want to smell like affogato. 

**6/10**

# Akro - Awake

**Notes:** 

Coffee, Cardamom, Italian Lemon, Haitian Vetiver

I adore the opening to this, the coffee note is so realistic -  rich and sweet, smells like the aromas of the fancy cafetiere coffee I make at the weekend, balanced by a beautiful, slightly nutty cardamon note - pairs so well. This feels like the coffee note I was looking for in the first place.

The drydown is equally beautiful- the coffee note is still a dark black espresso, but the squeeze of lemon (which smells just like the zesty lemon in [Akro's Bake](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Akro/Bake-81614.html)) balances that out so the sillage smalls quite fresh and bright - with aromatic and sweet cardamon with a dry vetitver base on my wrist. 

Truly unisex, gourmand but wearable, with the perfect level of sweetness. I think this is a really special blend, a perfect balance of notes.

This is a rewarding and unique take on the coffee note, with no sugar or caramel or chocolate. This is a coffee scent for those who like their coffee black but also want something wearable and slightly fresh.

This lasts about four hours on me with good, beautiful sillage. A great coffee perfume!

**9/10**

There we go! I kind of don't want to smell like coffee for a while now, but I would love to hear your favourite takes on the coffee note. ",10,1747679112.0,FemFragLab,5,1.0,False

1kqj2vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/mecharena/comments/1kqj2vz/what_the_report_cheater_button_really_does/,"What the ""Report Cheater"" button REALLY does","Plarium *encourages* the use of the ""report cheater"" button, ostensibly to let them know when people are hacking the program.  But if we're honest, the vast majority of toxic players are not hackers. I have used the button a great many times, usually to report problems that are not actually hacking. ONE time I received an official response. The reported player truly was hacking and Plarium shut down their account.

Did you know they will respond? Have you ever received a message that they followed up, confirmed cheating, and removed the cheater's account?

Honestly, though, how often does that happen? One in a thousand? One in ten thousand?

I used to think the majority of those reports were just losers whining that they got beat. But I've played long enough to see how it works. 

As of today, I've played 7,536 battles. There have been a handful of times, fewer than ten battles, when I sent out my regular team and my first Mech wiped out 20 or more of the 25 enemy mechs. Frankly, it's exciting once or twice, but ultimately less rewarding than a #1 Dad coffee mug. That's not based on any skill at all. No objective competition; it's purely a gimme. 

Unfortunately, I see the other side of it every single day. Every day, I play a few battles and without fail my mechs sporting weapons levels of 12, 16, and 20 are facing opponents with 24, 28, and 32. My two hangars, which I try to keep balanced, are rated at roughly 4K and 6K SP. More often than not, if I lose a battle, the human players I was facing are not SP dropping, they were actually fielding a hangar of 25-50% more power. Sometimes more. Yesterday my 4K team was matched against 7.5K team, nearly double my SP. 

What do you do? The guy wasn't hacking the game. He wasn't even SP dropping. He was just going to town on an opponent with half his power. 

Roughly half the battles I fight are against significantly superior hangars. My 16 weapons vs. their 28's, my five star pilots vs. their maxed out pink stars, my Tier IV mechs vs. legendary Tier IX.  That's a problem with the matching system.  Does Plarium realize THAT'S the issue for that 99.99% of those ""report cheaters"" actions? It's a plea for some kind of algorithm that will match opponents of SIMILAR LEVELS so we can enjoy a competitive match rather than an outright slaughter of inferior forces. 

TL/DR: When you use the ""report cheaters"" button, really Plarium's algorithm is the cheater rigging the match.

...Holy sh\*t. I have literally cried over how well it works.  ;\_; Absolutely mind blowing, thank you so, so much for sharing this. 

  
I'm still confused because I thought caffeine is just caffeine, like, why would it be different from coffee? But apparently it is, googling says it might be due to the sugar content in the energy drinks.

  
Just to make it clear, this apparently only works on ""some"" people with adhd, but if you're out of ideas and still desperate / curious like I was, this could be a thing to try. And obviously, it's unhealthy, so moderation and all that... I am not a professional, don't listen to me! In fact, I have no idea what I'm doing. <3
