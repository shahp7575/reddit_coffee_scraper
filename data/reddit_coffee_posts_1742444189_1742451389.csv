Trying to lose weight can feel like being stuck on a **treadmill that only moves backward**.

You cut carbs, you hit the gym, you avoid the cookie aisle like it‚Äôs a crime scene‚Äîyet the scale refuses to budge. It‚Äôs frustrating, mentally exhausting, and, frankly, unfair.

So what if there was a **way to boost metabolism** without **giving up everything that makes life worth living**? 

That‚Äôs the promise behind [PT Trim Fat Burn](https://theworldhealth.org/pttrimfatburn-official), a supplement claiming to **help burn fat faster** using a rare **Kenyan purple tea**.

The big question is‚Äîdoes it actually work, or is this just another **overhyped bottle of hope**?

Let‚Äôs crack open a bottle and find out ...

# Product Overview

* **Product Name:** **PT Trim Fat Burn**
* **Category:** **Weight Loss Supplements**
* **Overall Verdict:** **4.8/5**

# How Does PT Trim Fat Burn Work?

The magic ingredient here is **purple tea extract**, which hails from the high-altitude regions of Kenya. It contains **GHG polyphenols**, compounds that are believed to **break down fat cells** while preserving lean muscle.

Unlike **green tea**, which is known for its **antioxidants**, **purple tea has additional compounds that may support fat loss**. Some studies suggest it‚Äôs even **more effective than green tea for weight loss**.

Other ingredients like **berberine, garcinia cambogia, and green tea extract** work alongside the **purple tea extract** to **help suppress cravings** and promote **natural fat-burning**. But does it actually deliver results?

# Effectiveness & Benefits

People looking for **natural fat burners that actually work** have likely tried a bit of everything. What makes **PT Trim Fat Burn** different is its **focus on polyphenols and fat metabolism** rather than high doses of caffeine.

The **best metabolism-boosting tea** should help with more than just calorie burning. **This formula also supports appetite control**, meaning you‚Äôre less likely to **snack your way into regret**. Some users claim to have lost inches without changing their diets too much.

While it‚Äôs not a **magic potion**, those who commit to using it consistently see **visible before and after results** over time. Of course, nothing replaces a **good diet and some form of movement**‚Äîeven if that‚Äôs just chasing your dog around the house.

# PT Trim Fat Burn vs. Green Tea Supplements ‚Äì Which is Better?

Since **green tea vs. purple tea** is a common debate in **weight loss supplements**, it‚Äôs worth comparing them. **Green tea** has been extensively studied for its **fat-burning properties**, thanks to its **catechins and caffeine content**.

**Purple tea, however, contains** [GHG polyphenols](https://theworldhealth.org/pttrimfatburn-official), which aren‚Äôt found in **green tea**. These compounds may **increase fat breakdown**, reduce **fat tissue thickness**, and promote lean muscle retention.

**Both teas have benefits**, but **purple tea‚Äôs unique compounds set it apart**.

If caffeine tends to **make you jittery**, **purple tea extract** might be a better option for **boosting metabolism without the crash**.

# Real Customer Reviews ‚Äì What Are People Saying?

A quick look at online feedback shows **a mix of success stories and the occasional complaint**. Some people report **before and after results**, claiming **stubborn fat started disappearing** after a few weeks.

Others say they felt **less hungry throughout the day**, which made **eating healthier much easier**. A few had **mild digestive discomfort**, but nothing serious.

Some **PT Trim Fat Burn complaints** come from users expecting overnight results. While it works **best with consistent use**, it‚Äôs **not going to make you drop 20 pounds in your sleep**.

# Personal Experience With PT Trim Fat Burn

My cousin **Rebecca** has always been a busy person‚Äîbetween raising two kids and running her own small bakery, she barely has time to sit down, let alone focus on weight loss.

Over the years, she tried everything from intermittent fasting to cutting carbs, but nothing seemed to stick. 

With early mornings spent kneading dough and late nights juggling orders, she needed something that could **help regulate cravings and support metabolism** without requiring a complete lifestyle overhaul.

After [hearing about PT Trim Fat Burn](https://theworldhealth.org/pttrimfatburn-official), she decided to give it a shot. Within the first week, she noticed one immediate change: her constant **mid-afternoon hunger cravings** had started to fade.

Normally, she‚Äôd reach for a pastry or a sugary coffee to keep herself going, but this time, she felt satisfied for longer stretches.

By the third week, she started seeing the scale move‚Äînothing drastic, but her jeans fit looser, and she felt **less bloated by the end of the day**. The best part? No jittery caffeine crashes like some **fat-burning supplements** had caused in the past.

The only thing she didn‚Äôt love? The capsules had a faint herbal scent, which took some getting used to. She‚Äôs not big on **strong herbal flavors**, so she made sure to take them with a full glass of water.

That small quirk aside, she‚Äôs happy with the results and still takes **PT Trim Fat Burn** daily to help maintain her progress.

# Side Effects & Safety Concerns

Most people handle **PT Trim Fat Burn** just fine, but a few mention **mild side effects** like **headaches** or **stomach discomfort**.

**Garcinia cambogia** can cause **dizziness for some people**, especially if taken on an empty stomach. **Berberine** has been studied for its ability to **help regulate blood sugar**, but some users experience **mild nausea** when first starting.

If you have existing health concerns, it‚Äôs smart to check with a **doctor before trying any supplement**.

# Pricing Options

Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

* **1 Bottle (30-day supply):** $89
* **3 Bottles (90-day supply):** $59 per bottle
* **6 Bottles (180-day supply):** $39 per bottle

Buying in bulk saves money, and there‚Äôs a **money-back guarantee**, which helps take some of the risk out of trying it.

# Where to Buy PT Trim Fat Burn

To **avoid counterfeit supplements**, the best place to buy **PT Trim Fat Burn** is [through the official website](https://theworldhealth.org/pttrimfatburn-official).

Scammers have been known to **sell fake versions**, and those don‚Äôt come with a **refund policy**. If you want **genuine PT Trim Fat Burn**, always go straight to the source.

How can I show effort?,"It‚Äôs been about 5 years since my last relationship. For about a year or 2 after that, I frequently went on dates with other women but nothing ever panned out. Eventually the dates went from trying to meet someone to just hooking up once or twice before someone else came along or they ghosted me. After a year of that, I sorta just gave up on meeting anyone in general.

A few weeks ago, after a couple of years of being off dating apps, I matched with someone. She‚Äôs very kind. I can see that she‚Äôs making an effort to get to know me. The conversations flow nicely and for the first time in a good while, I find myself wanting to meet someone and genuinely hoping a relationship can maybe form.

I finally felt comfortable enough to ask her if she‚Äôd like to go out on a date sometime. She agreed and we‚Äôre planning on meeting Friday.

The thing is, I‚Äôve sorta forgotten how to actually plan out a date or how to prepare for a date. Back when I actually knew how to talk to people, I‚Äôd usually just go for a coffee date or lunch at the park. This was back when I was like 21 so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôd be enticing for adults in their late 20‚Äôs.

Overall, I‚Äôm super excited to meet her and I‚Äôm hopeful that she‚Äôll like me enough to at least agree to a 2nd date, but I don‚Äôt even know how to date anymore.

I've been chatting with someone that I met in a fb group for a certain hobby for singles. It's been light and friendly and mostly about our shared love of said hobby. The intention has always been clear that the goal is connecting in person to see if there is something that could unfold into more.

I've been burned in the past by letting a conversation get too deep before meeting in person, so I'm eager to either make a plan or wrap it up. We've been in each other's dm's for over a month. But chatting daily for a week. When I strongly suggested that I was ready to make a plan, they said they were busy for a little while but did have a suggestion for where we should go. And then they asked me to tell them more about myself.

I would like to give this person enough of a response to validate their need to have more of an understanding of each other (because we really know very little outside of our single status and each have a small digital footprint). But with that message, I want to wrap it up and leave an open invitation to meet for coffee.

1jfia07,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1jfia07/neighbor_kid_is_becoming_very_clingy_to_my_3yo/,"Neighbor kid is becoming very clingy to my 3yo, feels like too much.","This is going to be incredibly long, but I feel like the details matter and I have no idea how to handle this situation. I‚Äôll preface by saying our neighbors at our house before were an old single lady and a coffee shop, so we really have no neighborly experience with children. (And sorry for the format I‚Äôm on mobile) 

We just moved to a new house at the end of last year and my three year old befriended the little girl that lives next door yesterday evening. She had noticed her jumping on the trampoline a few times now that the weather has warmed up and had expressed interest in introducing herself, my husband and I didn‚Äôt see any harm, so we encouraged her. Anyway, yesterday she was out jumping again and we were eating dinner outside and my daughter wanted to officially say hello. It looked like her dad was sitting out there with her, so my husband took her over to meet them. The girls kind of hit it off, my 3 year old is very VERY chatty, and so they immediately start jumping and giggling. They learn that the neighbor girl is 6 and an only child(we‚Äôll call her ‚ÄúSara‚Äù) and that what we thought was a multi-generational home is actually just 5 adults renting together and one of the couple‚Äôs child. Interesting arrangement, but none of our business. The man with her, turned out not to be her father, doesn‚Äôt speak English at all and neither do any of the other adults living there. That part was fine for that interaction because my husband knows enough Spanish to have a casual conversation and to ask some questions. Was a short and positive interaction, husband brings her home to finish dinner and take a bath/go to bed. 3yo was thrilled about their new friend, cool. 

Not 15 minutes later ‚ÄúSara‚Äù has knocked on our door and left a little post it note drawing of her and my daughter playing on our front door, then left before we could talk to her, we thought that was sweet, right? Maybe not. Fast forward a couple of hours later around 8 and my husband is putting daughter to bed so I go out to run a quick errand and ‚ÄúSara‚Äù is standing in the patch of grass in between our driveways. She runs towards my car and hands me another note for my daughter, this time it‚Äôs wrapped around a little tube of play lipstick. I was taken off guard and didn‚Äôt really know what to say/do so I just took it and told her that it was sweet and I‚Äôd give it to my daughter in the morning when she woke up. This made me feel kind of sad for her and I texted my husband as much, because she was out alone and it was getting late and it made her seem really lonely to me, idk. 

This afternoon we get home from school and ‚ÄúSara‚Äù is waiting at our gate, my daughter is excited to see her. I tell her they can play together but that it had to be in our backyard because I needed to work a little and I feel like she‚Äôs too young to go play with someone we just met without my supervision. They were fine with this. But, my daughter being 3, was quickly annoyed by the wind blowing her toys around and was ready to go inside. I had her tell ‚ÄúSara‚Äù goodbye and we head in for some screen time and snacks (moms gotta work haha). 30ish mins later I wrap up work and walk through my tv room to check on my daughter and in the window I see ‚ÄúSara‚Äù just standing there watching tv through the window on our front porch and it made me feel VERY weird. My daughter has also noticed by this point, and was again intrigued by her new friend. And so we went outside to see if she was ok and when we do we see that she‚Äôs not just simply looking through the window but has brought snacks and a stool over to do so. I was surprised to say the least, but I didn‚Äôt want to make her feel bad, so I asked her if she wanted to go ask her grown up if she could come watch tv. She immediately said no and said she didn‚Äôt want to come inside because she is afraid of our dogs, ok fine. Daughter wants to play with her now so we stay outside, but then it starts to drizzle, back in we go. Goodbye ‚ÄúSara‚Äù. 

Rain passes, I let the dogs out and ‚ÄúSara‚Äù is BACK. She‚Äôs knocking on the door and now that the dogs are outside she wants to come in. Daughter also wants this, again not wanting to make her feel unwelcome, I say she can come in until our dinner is ready. They go to my daughters room she shows her toys and then they ask if they can watch tv, I say sure but that they only had a few minutes left together. Dinners ready I send ‚ÄúSara‚Äù home but she wants my daughter to come see her room now. I decline and try to explain why I can‚Äôt let her go over alone and that right now isn‚Äôt a good time for me to leave. She either doesn‚Äôt understand or just decides to completely disregard what I‚Äôve said and takes my daughter‚Äôs hand and is trying to get my daughter to come any way. Now I am SO uncomfortable, daughter is upset that I‚Äôm saying no, and ‚ÄúSara‚Äù is just not leaving. I have to pretty directly tell her to leave, she does. I felt a little mean but mostly weirded out by the situation we‚Äôve found ourselves in with this girl who seems to be really sweet just lonely and maybe lacking some social skills. 

I guess what I want advice on is: 
1)Is this normal neighbor kid behavior and I‚Äôm over thinking it? Or does this seem incredibly clingy, and if so, how do I nip it in the bud and politely lay out our boundaries to a girl/parents/trusted adults that I don‚Äôt know and can‚Äôt communicate well with? Is this just cultural differences that I‚Äôm ignorant to? 
2) how do I get my daughter to understand why she can‚Äôt just run around from house to house without a parent like ‚ÄúSara‚Äù does. Especially because we have yet to meet either of her parents, just the two unrelated men also living there. Of course we talked with her about it tonight and she ultimately listens to what we say of course, but I really want it to make sense to her too. 

TLDR: My 3yo daughter recently befriended our 6yo neighbor who is now constantly over, even when we haven‚Äôt invited her. None of the adults in her household speak the same language as us and so we aren‚Äôt sure how to communicate our rules/boundaries to them. We definitely don‚Äôt want to come off as unwelcoming or rude, but this has already become too much. How do we handle this situation? ",1,1742450456.0,Parenting,0,1.0,False

1. The Meeting
Unifies change, submersion of two things coming together or re making. 
2. The Seeker
Similiar to The Clown, it shows where your energy is at in a softer form that leaves me to get more interpersonal with what comes through
3. The Hidden Path.
Urges to understand not everything can be said through intellect, paths are being worked on. Be open to the unexpected.
4. The Mirror.
One of the most mysterious and bold cards, it tells you whatever energy you're putting out is being mirrored by someone or something.
5. The Familiar.
With the sideways coffee cup, it says align yourself with things that bring you comfort in resonation, you may find a few sparks.
6. Fate's Hand.
The title speaks a volume: fate's hand is in more control during this period or situation. Understand you can't control it.
7. The obstacle.
It says there's a block, a thing causing lack of movement or steering you away.
8. Two of cups
Just love and luck stuff, it's a classic card!

First off, we're treated to the spectacle of Tim, resplendent in her teddy bear pajamas (when isn‚Äôt she in pajamas lately), yapping about the weather and Fatlos's whereabouts. The sheer, unadulterated *fakery* when she coos at her dogs? It's enough to make your stomach do the tango. And that baby voice? Sweet merciful Zeus, My ears are bleeding.

Three minutes in, and we're already knee-deep in Tim's questionable hygiene. ""I'll wash my hair tomorrow,"" she proclaims, ""because it gets greasy if I wash it too soon."" Honey, wash your fucking hair. And then, the grand display of wealth: eggs! Cooked in the same yellow egg-maker I, tragically, own. I'm taking applications for a support group.

Fatlos makes his grand entrance with a haircut that can only be described as ""pubic q-tip chic."" They share eggs, and Tim, suddenly a sports expert because she owns an ""I Love Sports"" sweatshirt, pontificates on‚Ä¶ sports.

The nails reveal. Are they ugly because of the nail tech, or because they're glued to Tim's‚Ä¶ well, let's just say ""unique"" appendages? They seem misshapen and looks odd.

Dollar Tree time! Gift baskets, because Tim's creativity knows no bounds. Back home, it's leftover pork belly time. And, as always, the eternal question: does anyone *actually* win that $100 she posts on her videos?

Day two, and surprise! Teddy bear pajamas. Mario is coming and doing house projects.¬† Two new archways are being added (I dislike the archways. Anyone else?).¬† The second bathroom is getting a mini facelift and the master bedroom is getting some new paint.¬† I think we now know why there has been so many uploads.¬† She has projects to pay for.

Factor sponsorship time! Tim claims they order less takeout. Yeah, and I'm the Queen of England. She's ""a hardcore foodie,"" she declares, while shoveling down the pre-made crap box meal. Honey, a foodie you are not.¬† Foodies eat more than pork belly, sausage, cucumber, rice, seafood boils and spring rolls.¬†

Mixtiles! Because what's more humble than plastering photoshopped pictures of yourself and your husband all over your walls? And, naturally, they're crooked. Those teddy bear look like they are practicing for a colonoscopy.

Nyquil drama! Tim, in a stunning display of cognitive prowess, mixed up Nyquil and Dayquil. Because colors are hard, apparently. She's exhausted, but not too tired to eat a sandwich, naturally.

Dinner with Timitch and Fatlos, where Fatlos's ""fresh cut"" is hidden under a beanie, and Tim's giant forehead is on full display. Atleast she isn‚Äôt in the teddy bear pajamas. ¬†¬†

Then, Bev's birthday party. Tim shows up looking like she just finished a full season of the Bachelor on her couch rotting.¬† What happened to washing your hair so it fresh for the party? She got all dolled up to eat korean BBQ at her house but not for a birthday party. Make it make sense.

Day three! Teddy bear pajamas in public! Let that sink in‚Ä¶3 days in the teddy bear pajamas and now in PUBLIC. She's lost 10 pounds, she claims. Where? Did they evaporate from sheer laziness? And the ""balance and self-discipline"" spiel? I nearly choked on my coffee. Tim, darling, you have the self-control of a toddler in a candy store. Also can we talk about the dry lips and the dandruff in the hair?¬† I‚Äôm not saying she needs to look like a super model when stepping outside of her house but for fucksakes.¬† This level of grossness is beyond anything I have ever seen from a content creator.¬†

Momma Tim‚Äôs house, teddy bear pajamas (again!). Mitch is thrilled with her cherry shot glasses, and the Dollar Tree gift baskets make a reappearance. The video ends with clips of her niece and nephew performing in a play.

I'm exhausted, the teddy bear pajamas need to be incinerated, and I'm pretty sure my brain cells are staging a mass exodus.

Around 2 years ago, she became really into christianity and made it become a part of her life. I've been really happy for her that she has found a path and a lifestyle that she really enjoys and feels like she belongs. Every time we hung out, which was pretty often, she would talk about her religion and how great it is. I found it pretty difficult to pry her away from that topic at times, but i didn't mind it at all. Last time i talked to her, she was telling me that she found a bible school just overseas that she is working towards attending in the future, and i am 100% willing to support her along the way.

Well, about 6 months ago Staci and i were casually having a beach party hangout with a few of our friends including some of my best friends, my boyfriend, and another girl who was tagging along with her boyfriend and also hanging out with us. We soon realized that we forgot some snacks back at my place, so i offered to drive back since i only live about 5 minutes away from that beach, and Staci decided to come along with me. It was just the 2 of us. I noticed that she looked a bit down and didn't look very excited to have this beach party. I asked her if she was okay, and she gave me the slight ""yeah.."" with a bit of a question mark at the end. A few seconds go by, and she started telling me about this guy that she really liked a lot. She didnt tell me who the guy was, and to this day i still don't know who it was. Anyway, she said she did not want to date a person who was not christian. Which i understand - if you're that passionate about something, you would want to find someone you can share that passion with. 

I eventually said that i was having some troubles with my religion as well. Everyone around me is christian-Staci, my boyfriend, my best friend, and almost over half my family is christian. I was already feeling a bit peer pressured that i should start being christian as well, but deep down i always knew that i was an atheist. And just to let you know, an atheist is someone with the LACK of belief that there is a god or multiple gods. Atheists do not BELIEVE that there is no god, we only know that we have no beliefs in our system. It's basically under the term of 'no religion,' and not 'anti-religion.' An atheist does not believe that there are gods, they do not believe that there are no gods, and they are not in the middle. They simply are 'no religion.' (although, i'm sure people like that are out there as well.)

However, i did not tell Staci that i thought i was an atheist. I only told her this: ""i believe there is truth in all religions. if you believe there is a god, then let there be a god. if you believe that there are multiple gods, then let there be multiple gods.""
But Staci just looked at me with a confused face, and told me that she thinks i should ""find a path."" She told me to look at the forest, and tell her who made it. And she responded with ""God. And only God."" She then was telling me about how much God has done for her and how he can do the same with me. At this point, i'm really feeling pressured. Like, what does she mean by that? 
I kept telling her that i in fact wasn't christian, and i was in no rush to try and follow the path of religion. But, she just kept going off about how i should be ""finding a path.""

We drove back to the beach, and i got there a bit confused and self-conscious about my lack of beliefs. A few days later, i told my best friend and my boyfriend about how i felt pressured and harassed by Staci's comments on my lack of religion. They seemed confused as well.

She did this a few more times, one where we were casually chatting in a coffee shop together and she was, again, telling me that i should find a path. We hopped back in my car and i started driving back to her house to drop her off for dinner. The drive was completely silent as i did not say anything and neither did she. She did leave my car when i got to her house and waved me a goodbye, and i did back. Again, did not end our hangout on very good terms and i went back home feeling pressured and harassed.
Another time where we were at my house painting my drawers to get ready to sell them, and she brought up the topic of her religion once more. I was getting kind of annoyed at this point, but i kept my cool because i didn't want to upset her. She then told me this: ""you should find something that drives you, something that makes you happy. Christianity is a really good option as it has helped me through hard times."" those exact words. But, i just flat out told her that i am not religious and i probably never will be. She still gave me a confused look after my slight assertiveness, but i quickly tried to change the topic after that. 
About a month went by after that, at this point it was December which is my busiest month as i am a dancer with excessive amounts of rehearsals, and rehearsals for choir as well, since it's Christmas time. During that whole month, Staci and i did not talk or text at all. I eventually found the time to text her and ask her to hangout. I still love Staci as she is one of my closest friends and i don't want to not schedule a hangout just because of some silly arguments. But, she replied back telling me that she's really busy and probably won't be free until the end of January. And i said that that was fine, since i probably won't be free until January anyways either.

Now, it is the end of March (she still doesn't know that i'm an atheist) and i still have not talked to Staci. Not a text, no instagram comments on my posts, no sending each other memes, nothing. I'm starting to get really worried. I do want to check up on her and i still want to be her friend because overall she is a really good friend and i don't want to lose her over this. For a few months now, i'm now positive that i am an atheist. It took me a long time to come to terms with, and i still struggle to this day about being an open atheist. Mainly because i don't want to feel judged like how Staci was judging me, and i feel that with so many christians around me that they will not accept me for who i am. I do want to be more open about my atheism because it is a part of me that is never going to change-i was pretty much born with it. I'm just scared that Staci will not want to be my friend anymore if she figures out that i'm an atheist.

Would i be the asshole if i told her after all these months of not talking that i'm an atheist? What do you guys think i should do? Anything helps üôè

1jfi04s,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jfi04s/is_this_normal_behaviour_in_todays_reality/,Is this normal behaviour in todays reality ?,"So I am 30y male. In one of the dating apps I have met an interesting girl. She is a doctor, the first impression of her was that she is very intelligent and mindful. During our conversation via app I proposed her to grab some coffee several times - which she rejected due to being constantly busy at the time. After a pause of several days, I have written her again asking for an honest explanation on what is wrong and why not just told me directly(pretty naive I know, but I was just bored ). This time she responded eagerly and agreed to have a date. On a second date, she surprisingly agreed me to visit her place (nothing wrong with inviting me on a second date to her place, but for me this is not the behavior of woman with which I am planning serious relations, at the end if she invited me so easily, so many many other guys too‚Ä¶) In one of our conversations, she mentioned that she is bisexual. A couple of days before our first date she registered on a sex website to find a girl partner. She sent nudes to one of the girls she found there, lol they even celebrated her birthday together (this is the same timeline she was rejecting to meet with me and couple of days before she agreed to go on our first date). She told me all this by herself - interestingly, not sure if she was serious, but mentioned that probably will continue contact with the girl but as a friend - go on coffee.  At the same time she is swearing that her last relation and sex were 3 years ago, had one sex partner in total).

My conclusion:
So, I kind of understand what happened - I am a backup option, I got it. I also kind of shocked how different the dating pool looks for me and girls - she is avg average-looking girl, with extra weight, but when she showed a number of chats in the dating app - I was shocked, like 30+. At the same time for me as guy I barely get responses or matches. It also frustrating that she looked first as a person for a serious relationship. But obviously, she just was looking for a hook-up.

My questions:
1. How common is this - are we cooked as a society ?) I understand all have their needs, but damn, have never thought for instance sending my nudes to somebody from sex arrangement web site. How do people get there? I mean she has a stable good paying job, steady career, intelligent, interesting and boom - sending nudes ). 
2. Why did she tell me this so easily- is this a normal situation in today's world? She said this was before me. For me it does not matter - it tells quite a bit about the person. What are your thoughts?
3. What would u do ?

Next week, I'm flying to a bigger hospital to have a 24 hour ambulatory EEG done. I know you're supposed to arrive with clean, dry hair and scalp so the electrodes can stick and there's no interference.

I am from a smaller city in Sweden near Stockholm (Uppsala) and to be honest I did not experience a lot of diversity growing up. My mom is actually from Spain and because of that some of my friends joke that I am mixed race because I‚Äôm darker (golden/olive skin) than most Swedes. As a result, I am really looking forward to experiencing different cultures and meeting new people in Chicago. 

That being said, I don‚Äôt want it to seem like I reduce people to their ethnicity‚Ä¶I am just wondering how to express my interest in learning about other cultures and meeting new people without being rude or insensitive. This applies to both friendships and relationships. 

Also, I was wondering what the dating culture is like. One my peers from University moved to America to play ice hockey (not NHL) and in his city he told me that dating is very different. In Sweden we have this tradition of going for a ‚Äúfika‚Äù (cinnamon roll usually but it can be any pastry) in the afternoon or a coffee or even walk just so we can talk and get to know each other. However, he told me that American women (in his state) think it‚Äôs weird and that most of his dates are either going out to dinner or a bar. He made it seemed as though spending and money and being successful play a bigger role in dating and I‚Äôm wondering if that‚Äôs also the case in Chicago. 

I was also told to avoid dating apps and try to meet people in person. The reason I was given is that in America, tall (187cm) white guys don‚Äôt really stand out unless they‚Äôre very muscular and I‚Äôm more on the lean side. Apparently American women like men who are ‚Äútall, dark, and handsome‚Äù so casual dating apps like Tinder cater more to African and Mexican Americans with darker complexions. I agree that it would be better for me to people in person‚Ä¶but given that I do not know anyone in Chicago I was hoping to connect with some people online and then go out to bar or something together rather than go alone. If casual dating apps aren‚Äôt option for European guys, what do white guys in America do? 

So when it comes to dating, is there anything I should know/do? In Sweden we are typically very reversed around people we don‚Äôt know, but I heard that Chicago (and central US in general) is very outgoing and friendly. Would it be weird to go to a bar alone in Chicago? If I do go out alone are most people open to chatting/meeting new people or do groups of friends just go out to hang out amongst themselves?

1jfhtbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGirlSurvivalGuide/comments/1jfhtbm/is_my_supervisor_a_micromanager/,Is my supervisor a micromanager?,"Hiya ü§ó,

I‚Äôve been working at Starbucks for a little less than a year now. I‚Äôve been feeling like one of my supervisors is a micromanager, but I‚Äôm not sure. I wonder if I‚Äôm just bothered by our interactions because I‚Äôm taking things personally.

He has corrected me on how I make coffee. One time, I put sugar, a splash of cream, and THEN let the coffee pour. My logic was that as the coffee poured, I‚Äôd work on another drink. Once the coffee was done, I‚Äôd come back to it, put a lid on, and hand it off. This felt like a way to streamline things, but he corrected me and said to not put the cream until after the coffee poured. Ok, whatever.

During another incident, I had my phone hooked up to the store radio and went to the back a few times to adjust the volume. I‚Äôll admit: maybe I went to the back a few too many times. He basically told me that if I kept going to the back, he‚Äôd have to stop me from using my phone on the radio. 

Another time, he told me I‚Äôd take over on espresso bar for one of my co-workers while they went on a break. I asked ‚Äúoh, are they going on lunch‚Äù. He responded, ‚Äúyeah, but that‚Äôs my job to tell them‚Äù. I‚Äôm thinking, well yeah, no shit. I wasn‚Äôt going to tell them. I guess I was just curious how long I‚Äôd be on bar. 

There have also been incidents where he requires verbal communication from me. He‚Äôll tell me he needs me to go to espresso bar and I might give a nod and then start heading there. But then he‚Äôll ask me ‚Äúok?‚Äù And he tilts his head and pokes his neck out a bit. I know that may sound like unnecessary detail, but it is something about that body language and him asking me to verbally respond when it is pretty clear I understood, that kinda annoys me and makes me‚Ä¶ uncomfortable. But ok, he needs me to be more vocal. Fine, whatever.

I made a joke a couple times about the whole radio thing. I was just having a sense of humor, not really thinking about the comments I made. About 5 minutes later, he randomly came up to me and says, ‚Äúcan I talk to you in the back for a minute‚Äù? It concerned me a bit because I thought maybe I was in trouble for something serious - oh! And he did the head tilt and neck pokey thing, ughh. Anyway, he told me he noticed I had made a comment about the radio incident twice and that I shouldn‚Äôt take it personally. The way he approached the conversation was like he was attempting to come off as understanding, but he seemed a bit‚Ä¶ tight. His tone seemed a bit firm almost. It threw me off because I didn‚Äôt even remember what I said and certainly didn‚Äôt mean anything by it. It kind of made me anxious and I‚Äôm sure he could notice me avoiding eye contact with him. I really didn‚Äôt like the interaction. 

I just wonder if I really am taking things personally. I don‚Äôt know. What I do know is I feel restricted when he‚Äôs my supervisor. With other supervisors, I notice I feel a lot more ‚Äòlax and social. 

So‚Ä¶ what are your thoughts on this? Am I being sensitive or is my supervisor a micromanager?

Written and edited by the¬†[MCAT Self Prep Tutoring Team](https://mcatselfprep.com/elite-mcat-tutoring/)

¬†¬†Home of the¬†[Free MCAT Prep Course](https://mcatselfprep.com/)

The MCAT (Medical College Admissions Test) is without a doubt one of the greatest struggles that premeds face. It‚Äôs most-likely harder, longer, and more important than the SAT, ACT, finals, or any test that you‚Äôve faced. For a lot of us, this intimidation prevents us from performing to the best of our abilities because we never took the time at the start to truly understand the MCAT. My name is Theo Bennett and I am one of the¬†[Head Tutors](https://mcatselfprep.com/elite-mcat-tutoring/)¬†for MCAT Self Prep. I achieved a perfect score on the MCAT (528) and since then I‚Äôve made it my mission to pass on my test-taking strategies to other pre-meds. Here are a few things that I wish I knew before I started my journey to a perfect MCAT score.

# 1. How Do I Start studying?¬†The Timeline

For most students, I recommend taking the MCAT during summer before or summer when you apply for medical school. Taking the test over the summer with minimal or no classes allows you to compress your study timeline. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anything longer than 6 months because (let‚Äôs be real), you won‚Äôt remember what you studied 8 months before. I can barely remember what I did last weekend, let alone my study sessions from last semester. Whenever you take the MCAT, make sure you give yourself enough time to study to get the score you want. After taking a¬†[free diagnostic test](https://mcatselfprep.com/free-and-low-cost-mcat-practice-exams/), decide on a goal score and calculate the number of hours that you need to study with the¬†[Create-your-own Study Plan Course](https://mcatselfprep.com/study-plan/). A good rule of thumb is that studying 10 hours a week for a month will average about a 1.5 point increase. So if you study 20hrs/week for 3 months you should expect to jump up by 9 points. If you are studying during the semester plan it out in advance to deliberately make that semester as light as possible.

I personally took the MCAT on May 23rd and started studying during the previous winter break. I studied during the spring semester but only took 12 credits that were fairly easy and then studied full-time for 4 weeks before my MCAT.

The MCAT study timeline should be largely broken into two phases. The first phase‚Äôs goal is to get through all the content. The second phase‚Äôs goal is to improve your test-taking abilities. The content phase should last until you are one month away from the test date (if you‚Äôre studying for 6 months then this would be the first 5), and then the final month should be primarily devoted to taking full-lengths. Whatever you do, I would highly recommend devoting at least 2-3 weeks before the test to do nothing but MCAT study. The 8-hour test (or 6 hour test for Summer 2020) should feel like a 2-hour test by test day. It won‚Äôt feel like a breeze, but it shouldn‚Äôt leave you mentally drained. That‚Äôs your goal.

# 2. Prep Courses vs. Self-Studying Content

The first question that you may ask yourself is: Will I use a prep program to learn the content or will I self-study? You should instead ask yourself: Do I want to pay¬†thousands¬†of dollars¬†to learn content when I could learn it for free by myself? The secret that the prep companies will never tell you is that the¬†[AAMC](https://students-residents.aamc.org/applying-medical-school/taking-mcat-exam/prepare-mcat-exam/)¬†(the MCAT administration) actually paid¬†[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat)¬†to create thousands of hours of videos that teach you the content directly. For free. It‚Äôs actually as close as you can get to the source itself. All the other prep companies, on the other hand, essentially try to parrot those same videos but charge you thousands of dollars for you to get it from a more-distant source.¬†

I personally only watched the Khan Academy videos on the¬†[MCAT Self Prep ecourse](https://mcatselfprep.com/ecourse-home/)¬†playlists and supplemented them with Princeton Review content book reading for concepts that I struggled with.

Least Expensive:¬†MCAT Self Prep / Khan Academy (Free)

# 3. Tutoring vs. Learning Test-Taking Alone

The second and last question that you need to ask yourself is this: can I do this alone? To answer this, you need to dig deep. Are you self-motivated? Do you hold yourself accountable? Are you a naturally gifted test-taker? The question isn‚Äôt¬†am I driven?, but¬†how do I learn best?¬†Most people will say‚Ä¶ If you are self-motivated then you should self-study, but this, in my opinion, isn‚Äôt true. I, for one, am self-motivated but I needed structure too.¬†

That‚Äôs why I personally chose¬†[MCAT Self Prep](https://mcatselfprep.com/ecourse-home/)‚Äîa free program that gives you structure but lets you customize through self-study.¬†

If you decide that you need accountability/test-taking advice, I would consider hiring a tutor. The last thing you want to do is take this test twice (the opportunity cost is huge), so it is totally worth spending the money to succeed the first time. If you decide to use tutoring, you¬†NEED¬†a tutor who scored within the range of your goal score (and if they did better than your goal score that is obviously a huge plus). This isn‚Äôt for everyone, but I would choose between 10 and 20 hours to maximize the value of those hours. If you‚Äôre cheap like me, just use those sessions to ask for their overall strategy tips. Have tutors teach you to fish, not give you fish metaphorically speaking. If you have specific problems that you are stuck on, just go on¬†[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/)¬†or¬†[Facebook study groups](https://mcatselfprep.com/join-facebook-study-group/)¬†and get answers for free.

# 4. Getting The Right MCAT Prep Materials¬†

Success on the MCAT does not necessarily mean getting a high score. Personal success is instead defined by over-performing based on the natural abilities and weaknesses that we individually bring to the table. Success is doing the best that you can do. The key to success for the MCAT or any difficult task is in the preparation. Prepping for the MCAT starts with getting the right materials. Let‚Äôs review what you should buy‚Äîfrom books, to practice tests, to the official AAMC material.

# Books

Buying review books¬†can be tricky. Reading them can be even more exhausting. Honestly, reading MCAT prep books were the least helpful thing for me. But I don‚Äôt want my experience to color yours as a lot of students find them to be incredibly helpful. The basic breakdown is that the Kaplan books are the standard and they cover all of the main material for the MCAT. Most people buy those. The added depth makes the Princeton Review books more dense and difficult to read but includes lots of low-yield topics for those trying to score super high. I personally chose the Princeton Review Books because they offered low-yield facts that you needed to know to score in the 100th percentile. However, they had terrible suggestions for CARS. Again this is just my experience. I also stopped reading the content books altogether after about 2 months of study. However, some people swear by it (especially books that are more fun and engaging like Exam Krackers)

I personally bought the Princeton Review books because they are more detailed (with less engaging pictures).

Princeton Review¬†‚Äì $100-200

Kaplan¬†‚Äì $100-200

Exam Krakers¬†‚Äì $100-200

# Videos

Other students, like me, choose to watch MCAT prep videos on YouTube. There are lots of options to choose from between Khan Academy, AK lectures, and more. Khan Academy is the gold standard because the AAMC paid Khan Academy to make the only official prep videos. Khan Academy, therefore, had insider access to all the AAMC material. Some students don‚Äôt like Khan Academy because they speak incredibly slow. I got a chrome extension called¬†[Video Speed Controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en)¬†so you can watch videos at over 2x speed (I would watch them up to 3.5x speed on subjects I understood really well) to save me dozens of hours.¬†

# Khan Academy Videos vs. Prep Books

Both options provide advantages and disadvantages. Khan Academy uses the official AAMC material to make their videos, but it will take you much longer to work through all of them than getting through the books. I may take 2-6 months to get through the videos and in that same time it would take you 2-6 weeks to get through the prep books. Ask yourself: do I zone out more during boring lectures or reading boring textbooks? There‚Äôs no other way to put it, getting through dozens of science subjects will inevitably become boring no matter how nerdy you are.

# Practice Tests¬†

Aside from buying the AAMC practice tests, some students purchase third party full-length exams (FLEs) if they have time in their schedule. Only buy these if you have extra study time available, otherwise, just start with the AAMC material. Practice tests are incredibly helpful because they teach you test-taking endurance and build your familiarity with the MCAT format. They are also a great way to learn content! The common practice test makers are Kaplan, Blueprint, Altius, and Princeton Review. For your convenience, we compiled a list of¬†[the best free and low cost practice exams](https://mcatselfprep.com/free-and-low-cost-mcat-practice-exams/)¬†to get you started. All of them are generally harder than the AAMC tests themselves. Kaplan‚Äôs are the most similar to the AAMC (add 2-3 pts to your FLE score) and Princeton Review‚Äôs are the hardest (I bombed a PR test and then scored 16 points higher on an official AAMC test THE NEXT DAY). Blueprint (add 3-4 pts to your score) and Altius (add 5-6 pts to your score) are in the middle. I would recommend buying the Altius tests if you want to practice with greater resistance (think of training with heavier weights to make competition seem easier) or Kaplan/Blueprint if you want to practice with a similar level of difficulty. Most of the top scorers will say that doing FLEs is the best way to prepare for the MCAT. I agree.¬†

I personally bought 10 Altius practice tests for $150 when they went on sale.

# AAMC

[I cannot recommend strongly enough that you buy all of the AAMC material](http://offers.aamc.org/mcat-study-materials-1). It‚Äôs almost a requirement. You‚Äôll need it. All of it. It‚Äôs truly worth every penny. Save at least 4 AAMC FLEs until your last month of studying. Take your first three official FLEs 3, 2, and 1 week away. The order doesn‚Äôt matter. Then take your last AAMC FLE (one of the scored ones) three days before test day. Make sure you spend at least 3 hours reviewing these tests the day after you take them. AAMC has also given us the opportunity to take thousands of prepared, official questions. Make sure you do them all.¬†

# Other

Some students choose to buy the massive¬†[UWorld](https://www.uworld.com/collegeprep/mcat/mcat.aspx)¬†section bank instead of practice tests. UWorld has done an incredible job creating excellent questions and explanations for each answer. They put out some of the highest quality prep material that I‚Äôve seen.

I personally did not buy UWorld because I opted for only using practice tests.

# 5. Mastering Content for the MCAT

Educational researchers have spent decades trying to understand how we all learn best and this form of self-testing wins out every time. Self-testing can involve many layers, from practice problems to mental outlines, but the basic principle is creating scenarios for yourself where you are forced to recall information about the material you studied. The beauty of self-testing is that it doesn‚Äôt even matter how accurately you can recall information; the physical act of recall is what strengthens the connections in your brain on a cellular level (this process is called long term potentiation for all the nerds out there). When active recall is paired with spaced-repetition, this strengthens these mental connections more and more.¬†

For most of us, flashcards are the simplest method of self-testing. You may remember making physical flashcards to learn a language or study for an exam in high school. However, with technology at our disposal, making flashcards has never been easier or more organized. You can even find¬†[new, creative ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIyDJK_SAjs)¬†to make flashcards on your own. However, if you are looking for tried and true methods that have enabled hundreds of the top scorers in the past, look no further than Quizlet and Anki.

# Quizlet¬†

[Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/)¬†is probably the flashcard software that you are most familiar with. The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly. There are hundreds of pre-made decks for the MCAT that you can search through if you don‚Äôt have the time or patience to make your own cards. However, Quizlet recently removed their spaced-repetition software and so there is no great way to only review the cards that you need to revisit. Our best advice is to star the cards that you miss and come back to the decks that you‚Äôve done after 2 days, a week, and once a month so that all of that information stays in your long-term memory. Another downside is that some of the advanced features like self-testing with images cost extra.¬†

I personally purchased the pre-made Quizlet decks as a part of the¬†[Advanced Pro Package](https://mcatselfprep.com/upgrade-to-pro/)¬†in addition to using Anki.

# Anki

If you haven‚Äôt heard of¬†[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)¬†by now, you probably haven‚Äôt¬†talked¬†to¬†anyone¬†in¬†medical¬†school. Anki, with spaced-repetition self-testing, has truly revolutionized medical education as we know it. Anki allows medical students, and MCAT test-takers, to store massive amounts of information in long-term memory. Think of Anki as a bare-bones version of Quizlet, except with an algorithm that dictates when you see new cards. After you reveal the answer to a given flashcard, you tell the algorithm whether that card was easy, medium, or hard for you. If it was hard, you may see that card the next day. If it was easy, you may see it in 5 days. Gradually, the intervals lengthen and so if you choose medium repeatedly for a card you would see it after 2, 4, 8, 12, and then 20 days for example.¬†

Anki also allows you to create cards using screenshots on your computer. You can choose which area of the image you want to cover and then the ‚Äúback of the flashcard answer‚Äù will reveal that area. Again, you can choose whether it was easy, medium, or hard to recall that visual answer.¬†

The only downside to Anki is that there is a significant start-up cost associated with learning how to use the application. It‚Äôs free which is nice, but if you want to download Anki to an iPhone that will also cost you $25. To learn to use Anki, I would recommend watching some¬†[Youtube¬†](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLeZR5LtbJ8Klmeux_6TTJw)[tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K2StK7e3ww&list=PL2ADAFpTg5aYuGojjD_O0mU1uml7Plw2Q)¬†because Anki is hard to figure out at first. These two video tutorial channels helped me a lot. Definitely figure out how to use image occlusion and close deletions for your card types and get a few more add-ons. Here is the list the¬†[add-ons](https://imgur.com/a/DxK6B91)¬†that I ended up using.¬†

Whether you end up using Quizlet or Anki, there are options to use pre-made decks. If you are short on time, FREE¬†[pre-made Anki decks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sz-vjFGyoGkwxLe8jd__537n8_O0QuFO/view)¬†can help save time. But if you plan on dedicating a few months to MCAT studying, please‚Ä¶ MAKE YOUR OWN CARDS. This will force you to actively engage in the learning process and your increased score will reflect that.

# 6. Moving from Mastering Content to Mastering Practice Tests

You‚Äôve worked your way through all the content required for the MCAT. You‚Äôve started learning how the AAMC wants you to think on test day! But despite all of these accomplishments, you still can‚Äôt get a handle on the timing for some or all of the sections on the MCAT. While we can‚Äôt fix timing issues overnight, here are 4 tricks to help with time management for the MCAT.

# Clockwork

For CARS, you will be given 90 minutes to complete 53 questions and 95 minutes to complete 59 questions for the other three science sections. On test-day, a timer will be counting down in the upper right-hand corner to show you how much time you have remaining. This can be both a blessing and a curse. For some of us, it aids in adjusting our test-taking speed in real-time. But for most of us, the timer just adds unnecessary stress. Stress can even slow us down by paralyzing some students in fear! Therefore, it becomes critical to use the timer as a valuable resource, without it becoming a distraction.¬†

A good sweet spot is to look at the timer at three critical points during the test and forget it for the rest. For the science sections, optimal pacing can be broken down to completing 20 questions every 30 minutes. This can be translated to test day by glancing at the clock after you have completed 20, 40, and 59 questions. After 20 questions, you should see that you have 1 hour and 5 minutes left. After 40 you should see 35 minutes left. For CARS, there are 9 passages and so you should complete 3 passages every 30 minutes. If you have more or less time at these waypoints, this will dictate your pacing for the rest of the section.¬†

# Too little time?

If you find yourself falling behind the ideal testing pace, there are a few things that you can do. The bottom line is that you ultimately need to find a strategy that works best for you. Will you read the passages faster? Answer questions relying more on your gut instincts? Skip an entire passage to focus on the others instead (not recommended if trying to score 510+)? Try all of these methods out in practice sessions and choose the one that feels the most natural for you. No matter how far behind you are‚Ä¶¬†still take the time to read the question stems quickly. The questions themselves are the most important piece of each passage and understanding them properly will yield the most points possible in a time crunch.

# Too much time?

Less than 5 minutes of extra time?¬†Spend these extra seconds focusing on 1 or 2 problems that you needed extra time on. Don‚Äôt try to skim through all of your flagged questions.

5 minutes of extra time?¬†Try to skim through all of your flagged questions and focus on the few hardest questions for you. In general, it makes much more sense to spend an extra 30 seconds in the initial read of the question while your brain has been synthesizing the information at hand. Don‚Äôt just flag every hard question to come back to later. Splitting up the time will force you to restart your thought processes and it limits your effectiveness (although occasionally your brain will gain new insights subconsciously in the while working through other problems).

10-15 minutes of extra time?¬†Use this time to double-check every. single. question. Don‚Äôt take the time to redo every problem, just check to make sure each choice answered the right question. Your primary job is to catch dumb mistakes like missing negative modifiers in the question stems (NOT/LEAST/WEAKENS etc.)¬†

20-25 minutes of extra time?¬†Run through every question again while also pausing to re-solve difficult and flagged questions. Perhaps you would benefit from reading passages and questions more carefully when working through them for the first time.

30+ minutes of extra time?¬†This usually only applies to quick test-takers on the Behavioral Sciences section. If you usually finish with TONS of time to spare, you need to slooooooow yourself down. We know that you‚Äôre tired. We know that you‚Äôve been sitting for 7 hours and just want to see your MCAT score. But practice test-taking conditions. Take the extra time to double-check every answer the first time. Read slowly and read every word of the passage. Try to finish with only 20 minutes to spare. This will bump your score up by at least a point or two.

# Practicing Timing

To practice timing, consider doing blocks of 20 science questions in 30 minutes. Do 40 questions in an hour. Practice your pacing. Practice the controlled rushing. Practice endurance as well by doing 12 CARS passages in 2 hours. Do 80 science questions in 2 hours. From there, a normal MCAT section should feel like a breeze.¬†

# 7. Test Day is Game Day

Most students who have taken the MCAT will consistently cite taking practice tests as the most important part of their preparation. However, practice tests can improve your MCAT score even more if you use them to simulate test-day conditions. As part of our online MCAT course, we walk our students through every aspect of the test-day experience. Here are a few pro-tips and aspects of test-day that will help you maximize the benefit from your practice tests.

# Using the Tutorial Time to Boost your Score

Before your practice tests, you will encounter a 10-minute tutorial that walks you through every feature of the MCAT software. For your first practice test, we recommend that you use this time to learn about all of the features at your disposal. Once you‚Äôve familiarized yourself with these features, for subsequent tests you can breeze through this introduction to get right to the test. Most MCAT prep courses will recommend that you skip this section on test day as well. But on test day, every minute that you‚Äôre given is precious.¬†

One pro-tip that can boost your score is using this 10-minute introduction to create a reference sheet for your test day. On test-day, you are given a¬†booklet of dry-erase sheets. During the introduction, you can write down every memorization-heavy concept that you find difficult to remember. Some examples are all of the amino acid R groups, stages of development according to various psychologists, even a list of physics equations! Spend an hour during the day or two before your test to create this list ahead of time. Then practice copying this list down from memory over and over again until you can do so effortlessly. Bring this list with you to the testing center so you can glance at it one last time before you head in to take your test. Again, we want to simulate test-taking conditions as much as possible when taking practice tests. So an option is to take your practice tests with this reference sheet in front of you! Hooray! No more memorizing pesky physics equations! (That said, we do recommend that you don‚Äôt take practice tests with the amino acid R groups in front of you as you should know them like the back of your hand even without the reference sheet.)

# Noise Cancelation and Screen Dimensions

The next thing you may notice when you sit down to take your test is the noise cancelation options and the dimensions of your screen. Pearson testing centers offer two methods of noise cancelation for every student: over-the-ear headphones and ear-plugs. In my experience, the headphones offered were terrible. They hurt my ears. I decided to use ear-plugs instead, but again it‚Äôs a personal preference. For either method, we recommend taking practice tests with the method of noise cancelation that you decide on (but if it‚Äôs headphones don‚Äôt use your $300 fancy ones because you will be disappointed on test-day).¬†

The MCAT will be administered on Windows desktops. If possible, take your practice tests on desktops with a mouse instead of a laptop. The dimensions of the test will also be squared with black bars on either side. This makes the CARS passages seem longer because you need to scroll more to get through them. So when taking practice tests, square your browser screen to simulate this effect.

# Taking Breaks

Because the MCAT lasts almost an entire day, you will be allowed to take 3 breaks during your test-day experience. Your breaks will last 10, 30, and 10 minutes after your Chemistry and Physics, CARS, and Biology and Biochemistry sections respectively. To make the most of these breaks, successful test-takers will fuel up with both foods and liquids. We think of taking the MCAT as running a marathon. It‚Äôs long. It‚Äôs hard. This endurance requires a constant and consistent output of energy. Marathon runners refuel by eating protein bars and other healthy foods. As you may know from your studies, sugary foods burn fast and bright but lead to physical and cognitive crashes after they are used up. We recommend eating and drinking as you would for a marathon (including frequent bathroom breaks). However, finding your own balance is the most important aspect of MCAT nutrition. Experiment with your breaks for your first few practice tests until you find out what works.

A word on caffeine: Just as you want to maintain consistent levels of blood sugar to prevent crashes, make sure to keep a consistent caffeine intake if you choose to use it. It‚Äôs much better to sip on a caffeinated beverage at each of your breaks rather than chugging 2 coffees right before the test starts. If you feel yourself crashing before the final section, feel free to pound caffeine to get you over the final hump because you can always crash later. As a natural alternative or supplement, I also did push-ups and jumping jacks during my breaks to wake my body up. Keeping the blood flowing can restart your focus after sitting in front of a computer for hours on end.¬†

# My Test Day Experience

Either the actual test day is the most stressful moment of your life or you are a legit sociopath. I was FREAKING OUT, PEOPLE! I drove to check out the testing center the day before. I typically have a hard time sleeping, but before the MCAT was another experience entirely. I took melatonin to try to get some rest, but I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all for the¬†TWO NIGHTS¬†before my test day. I could honestly account for every hour of the night. Not falling asleep just led to me stressing more so it was even harder to fall asleep. Horrible. But it‚Äôs ok! Even if you‚Äôre tired, it won‚Äôt make your mind forget all the content that you learned. For game day, your goal is just to get excited. It‚Äôs finally going to be over. Be confident. You put in hundreds of hours. TRUST YOUR STUDIES. If you come to a question and you are unsure, go with your gut. You may remember the appropriate content subconsciously.¬†

When you get to the center, they start checking you in right away. Even if you‚Äôre early. Be early. But you don‚Äôt have to take a number right away. Wait until you‚Äôre ready. For security reasons, proctors will scan your palms. They lead you to your chair. They offer you earplugs,¬†dry erase sheets and a marker. When you sit down after a break, they start you immediately‚Äîeven if you still had 2 minutes remaining for your break. If you run a bit over your break, don‚Äôt worry. They give you \~2 minutes to just read the info start screen of each section so your time will only be deducted from that. If you have that time, use it to calm yourself before starting. Don‚Äôt rush yourself. Breathe.

Since I got no sleep, I took a ton of caffeine over the course of the test. About 20-50 mg before and during every break. I crashed like a zombie after it was all done, but I never felt sleepy or crashed during the test. To naturally keep your alertness levels up, a friend suggested that I do push-ups during the break to keep the blood flowing. That really helped. Your breaks are shorter than you remember, but you should eat something during every break or else you will crash. When taking FLEs, find out what food sustains you best. Don‚Äôt eat sugary trash. Eat protein bars and real food. Eat like you would eat if running a marathon, small but consistent, so you don‚Äôt hit a food coma either. Poop and pee before you enter the exam. Multiple times. Everything should be totally flushed out down there.

After each section, you want to get in the mental space of feeling relief. Done with CARS? You will never have to read another CARS passage again. Did the last section not go that well? Don‚Äôt let it bleed into the next section. Let it go. You should be getting more excited and more relaxed as the day progresses. Stressed? Tell yourself to let it go. Let it all go from your head. Your mental appraisal is very important to doing well.¬†

In the end, if your computer didn‚Äôt explode and if you didn‚Äôt throw up on yourself,¬†don‚Äôt void your test. Natural variation in test day scores happens. You may score better or worse than your practice tests, but how you felt about your test is not correlated to your actual score.¬†Even if you don‚Äôt feel confident, score it. Don‚Äôt spend more than 15 seconds on voiding your test page. Let it all go. You did it.¬†

You don‚Äôt need to spend thousands of dollars on an over-priced MCAT course when you have the best¬†[FREE MCAT Course](https://mcatselfprep.com/ecourse-home/)¬†at your fingertips, like I did.¬†If you have any questions at all, please be sure to¬†[reach out](https://mcatselfprep.com/free-consultation-with-andrew/).

She said it's because I looked in a car window trying to find her.,"We've been dating over a year. She sells custom t+shirts and stuff like that to a lot of Motorcycle and other ""Social""clubs. A lot of the time I pay for material up front for her and I had just driven to pay for some stuff for her and we were going to get a hotel and chill after some drinks. She got a call from a client and we went to meet him at a donut shop. He hadn't gotten there yet when we got there and she asked me to go get her a bottle to spike her coffee while she waited. I came back and she wasn't in the donut shop. I figured she was in his car but looked in the parking lot and didn't see anybody. I checked the bar next door, walked around both buildings then I tried to call her. Straight to voicemail. She has just left me without texting or calling or anything before so I started to get concerned. I noticed a car right by where I was parked with really dark windows. I can't see very well so I went to the passenger side and leaned down. I waved to her she opened the door and said she would be done in a minute. She finished up and got in the car. She was obviously annoyed I told her I was just trying to figure out where she went and we kinda dropped it. She says her clients are really rough people and she's always telling me that I am going to piss them off or something. I'm a combat related disabled Marine and I stay in good shape so I can handle myself pretty well so that's kinda insulting but whatever.

I tried to ask her what was going on and they slammed the door and left. Long story short I followed them and tried to get her to come with me because she was totally hammered. She refused to come with me and when I left she was laying in the back seat of a car with one of them. She wouldn't tell me what happened the next day but I'm not stupid.

There is a minute in time, a minute that you disconnect yourself from everything that you are doing and take a stroll, a dip in the water, or even to a space or corner just to take a moment, meditate, pray. I was reminded the other night, as I walked, of the song of Police. You see, there is so much beauty in different songs where messages just come and go. I love that song, but I also love it more when Father Almighty speaks through words, lyrics, and the behavior of people. I smile when I pray, whether I am walking or where I can‚Ä¶even in the shower, and ask questions, and He comes back with full answers displayed in many ways.¬†

I wanted to share a testimony, something learned in the different parts that I have travelled and lived; that testimony is called living. We testify to what we have walked and lived, the beauty when God places other people in your life so we may open our eyes and see how we used to be, to who we are today. The Love that goes beyond borders. We live in breadth (width), length, height, and depth. A relational dimension means the nature and quality of the relationships that have developed through a history of interaction and play out in behavioral attributes such as trustworthiness and, most of all, heart. As I prayed the other day, my thoughts were about kindness, heart, caring and sharing‚Ä¶which was one of my questions as I took a walk in the park. I asked what he meant by‚Ä¶‚ÄùBut, what was love?‚Äù It is in those moments where God comes with a slap in your face‚Ä¶ you see, a nurse or physician lady(sorry, I did not know but was dressed with hospital scrubs stopped her car and asked I could help a turtle that is crossing a street in its slow motion movement, and time can not catch it‚Ä¶ because the movement of a car is faster than speed of the turtle(its size a bit bigger than the size of my hand). What are the odds in that particular moment where God says there is love and there is kindness for those who care for nature...even for a maintenance truck of the City of Plantation car to stop and assist in saving this little animal and place it in the pond. Once it got to the water, he swam as fast as it could and disappeared. I loved that moment, but I loved it more because I pray as I walk, asking a lot of questions.¬†

‚ÄúBut, what is love?‚Äù You see the word ‚ÄúBut‚Äù ‚Äúis used to indicate the impossibility of anything other than what is being stated,‚Äùand I thought about the song mentioned and the lyrics ‚ÄúEvery breath you take, and every move you make,every bond you break. Every step you take, I‚Äôll be watching you‚Äù. Father Almighty is in a piece or any lyrics of every song ever made and somehow, we do not even realize it is there. Somehow, somewhere, God has placed his hand over every singer, artist in his own way believer or not and yet, so impactful in every human being.¬† Love is everywhere; it is the time that we choose to spend in that particular moment,listening or reading lyrics where we think how it applies to me, and there, just there, in that moment, in that dimension, in that space, we take a moment, find that deep inhaled breath that we take to connect to our heavenly Father, to look up and know that we are watched no matter what we do or where we are, we are seen by Him and yup He is listening!. He knows absolutely everything from us, the bond broken, the sins but We are forgiven because he gave his life for us, his blood covers us. The word ‚ÄúBut"" is placed in front of many words and we do not realize it, it is part of our human nature to find what is unreachable, what is impossible, and we tend to forget that all is possible for our Father Almighty.¬†

But, what is love‚Ä¶love is not impossible. Yesterday, I took a swim in the pool, and after that, I heard something on the radio. It reminded me of how my life changed; where one can make ourselves sick, we declare upon us our own sicknesses, on top of that we nurture it so we may feel even sicker, until it comes to the point that you are really sick, the cherry on top is when even those next to you declare it on you as well. I was reminded going from migraines for 14 days to having no more migraines and how wonderful and miraculous Father is that Sent sisters to pray over, and all was lifted. Love is in the surrender; it is declaring our health and elevating in prayer to find our balance yielding to peace, and that is an anointing oil for our soul, our heart, and most of all, our body.¬†

But, what is Love, when a lady of Petco helped me, such enhancing customer service moment to solve my problem and giving it a new perspective, making a clients sincerity come to pass, resolving any issues and taking the company to a higher level.¬† Is it not love, when Higher Education Institutions take into consideration the one or students that cannot reach them because financially they cannot study or qualify for a grant, is not love when hearts are touched and barriers are moved, even education in named schools become free up to certain amount. I love Father Almighty when ahe opens doors that no one can shut.¬†

But, what is Love‚Ä¶when there is no ""but"", just heart simply heart, in order for others to achieve their best, Is it not love when Doctors move by heart to arrange and move for their patients, create space to be innovative and give compassion a full spin to bring happiness and love to a human being. Is it not love those who go out the most to save and to guard, to be defenders of the people, for the people to share and care.¬†

Is it, not Love, the blessing that we can count per day, whether big or small? They are still blessings? Is it not love, the one who extends a hand to young adult, so they may have a better life,. It is love that my hand is all over this place called of home bringing goodness, the just and righteousness and time only time will tell in my will, it will be set and written in the heart of every child, teenager, adult and all. Love is the one who defends and places no barriers but just heart. Pray for those who give hearts to others. This love and peace for all in Jesus name amen amen¬†

Here is something I learned in the Netherlands: I work in a fast-paced environment where you snooze and you lose. The rush, the adrenaline, and obviously a really moving, fun environment. Yet, when I moved to the Netherlands, there was something precious that was achieved, learned. Taking care of business means you have to extenuate to get things done‚Ä¶ however in Netherkands, I learned that to close a deal; there was time, a time to sit outside in nature, to enjoy the surroundings, have a cup of coffee, and have a lovely conversation ‚Ä¶ something that I did not do before (this was because everything was in the snap of the fingers to close a deal)and in the process to cover business to close a deal. It is a level of being confident and comfortable, bringing peace to your soul. I learned to love myself for who I am, and people look for you, for who you are. It is funny, when everybody gets a say and then a video pops up; I watched a video that I love of Andrew Garfield saying, ‚ÄúIf you have a problem with me, text me, and if you do not have my number, then you are not a friend of mine.‚Äù Same all for business; seeing a face and having a conversation to know people is so essential; it adds a special touch. I am surrounded today by many people that I respect, and they respect who I am and are friends other than colleagues in business as well. I learned that people follow you and that kindness overflows when you open the gates of love. I learned to love my body, which means my body will let me know what I need and when I need it, and believe me, I will take the rest, or the time when I need it. I also learned that my mind is powerful and how oneself can change our mentality to see things in a different perspective. Balance can be found when you are in silence when you step aside and enjoy the beauty that Father has given you.¬†

The most significant learning was taking time for yourself and nurturing yourself. I take time for myself; my body will always speak to me. Many people place these ugly sicknesses and names to them, and your head is made cozy like a baby, thinking I am this or that, when in reality, your mind allows you to turn it around and place positive thoughts about it. I love taking time, whether it is walking, speaking, listening, or even taking a swim, just floating and connecting inward and praying to turn in and surrender to Father Almighty. There are many things I can't resolve, many things that can surpass your capacity and perhaps even at times think unsolvable for me as a human being but my God can.¬† I definitely have learned that I have a Father in heaven. He makes miracles happen every day, He places people in my life, those who I know and some I don‚Äôt know, who can transform your life, He touches hearts, creating these sparkles of love to share and care, good deeds goes a long way.

A famous Dutch saying.- Rust, Reinhard en Regelmaat, ‚ÄúThe brain needs to rest to process all the experiences of that day and recharge.‚Äù Learning how to maintain balance is necessary, ‚Äúrest, cleanliness, and regularity and since then, the three R‚Äôs have never completely disappeared. The words alone exude something beneficial, the wonderful promise of overview and control, of order and calm. what exactly are we talking about when we talk about rest, cleanliness and regularity? Why do you get the best ideas in the shower? Haven‚Äôt we become too clean, and when did people become slaves to the clock? ‚Äùby eesie.home blog part 1 and 2 The Easy life Blog.-Regie, Respect, Reconciliatie en Realisatie which means ‚ÄúDirection, Respect, Reconciliation and Realization.‚ÄùThe Easy life Blog

This is a huge echo, which is ‚Äúthe concept of echoing, as a sound-reflecting and returning, can be metaphorically linked to biblical themes, such as the reverberation of God's word, the consequences of actions, and the enduring impact of divine truth.‚Äù ‚ÄúDivine truth Absolute and Eternal: Divine truths are often viewed as unchanging and timeless.¬†Revealed: They are believed to be revealed through divine means, such as scripture, prophets, or spiritual experiences.¬†Foundation for Spiritual Understanding: Divine truths are seen as essential for understanding the nature of reality, the divine, and one's place in the universe.¬†Source of Guidance: They provide moral and spiritual guidance for living a meaningful and fulfilling life.‚Äù

A direction that is unchangeable with God, ‚ÄúIt also acknowledges that God has made everything beautiful in its own time and has planted eternity in the human heart.‚Äù ""Defender"" is often associated with God as the protector and advocate of His people. The concept of God as a defender is woven throughout Scripture, highlighting His role in safeguarding, delivering, and upholding justice for those who trust in Him.‚Äù

Reverberation A reverberation is an echoing sound. When you bang on a big piece of metal, you can hear the reverberation even after you stop banging. The repeating, often low, booming sound that follows the strum of an electric guitar or the thump of a drumstick on a cymbal is called reverberation.

Glory be to the Father, Glory be to the Son, Glory be to the Holy Spirit.-But, what is love? I come to ask you today, I come to seek your attention, I come to fill your souls and I come to fulfill such destiny that seeking for says the Lord of the Heights. Many things have been written for ages and ages and yet, the indifference of man has been bigger that rests upon their. Heart. But today, I come with a reflective question, what is love? Has it not been written, yes you, you each one of you children of mine. Is it not love the one who rejoices in me, thee who rejoices because love has been found and their path has been made even though blood and flesh may be stronger and yet still seeks to be under my wings in the middle of their storm says Jesus Christ in this day. Many have walked this path and still found excuses to run out and seek for world may give. Is it not written in my word, in my lyrics 1 Corinthians 1:31 KJV ‚Äú31¬†That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.‚Äù Let your voice echo says the Lord, let be heard, let it be guided with respect, in reverberation so it may be heard, the sound even when you have stopped speaking, even if you have stopped singing, so it may it produce an effect that can yield so much light. Let my words reconcile in every heart, in every mind, let it be like the drums, those that announce my coming, the vibration tranform the surrounding air, let the air molecules that have been compressed be decompressed and let them expand says the Lord like the sound waves created by the drums. Let the sound of my thunder amplify the roots of this place that you call Home.

Hear me today, my child, there is no mistake, there is no error or omissions, there is a realization that is coming, a shell, an overall tone, and it will sustain says the Lord of the Heights. Yes, you, you the one in outer of space, the one that questions and thanks me every day for the experiences that you have, you have my confirmation, you see the vibrations, the frequencies says the Lord, you get to enjoy and your heart beats at the complexity of the sound, such love, such love that only I can give you.¬†

But, what is love? Is it in the pitch, whether it is high or low? No matter how it flows, it is an aspect that only is in you, in your heart, that makes it move. Do you not see that it is in this time that I have been visiting, this time that I have shared many messages, that you have felt my presence, the effect to achieve a greater good for you, for each one of you? ‚Äú Why are you ashamed of what I try to magnify?‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlace it in the dark when it is light‚Äù. Gatekeepers have been appointed to guard the entrance to the house of the Lord. The gatekeepers have been stationed on all four sides of the house, even those above rotating around, and at a distance.¬†So you see my power and authority is further beyond what man can do. I am who I am, says Jesus Christ in this day, the keeper, the giver and the taker. I have in this time touched many hearts, assigned duties both administrative and spiritual. ‚ÄúTheir trust reflects the broader biblical theme of stewardship.‚Äù Is it not providing direction, whereas in the journey of that so much sought personal journey, you sought the battle and here it is, you asked if I existed and Here I Am, you asked me if there was fear and yet you shield in a shell as hard as one of the turtle, you hide in maybe this will do it or that and yet, you still do not believe, child of mine of no Faith. You stopped to see my son, yes you, trying to control but you did not have control when you went through that accident that only I could have given you your life back says the Lord of the heights. There is so much to work to do, but you chose to close your eyes and not see, you closed your ears and chose to not hear. Yet, says the Lord how compassionate am I of your Soul, I could have taken you many times, there are many praying for you and your pride says the Lord of the Heights. Reconciliation, seeking me, because at the end of the road you will come to my table and realize all that is stated in that folder that I have for you says the Lord of the Heights. Is it not that you were once a defender and today look where you are, so in this time I come says Jesus Christ in this day to remind my children it is a time for much revival in this world but, it is also a time to realize the importance of reconciliation, I tell thee today, woe to the one who does not forgive, woe to one that places pride in front of the love that I am giving you. You asked me, today I come to show you what love really is says the Lord. I ask you today ‚ÄúBut, What is Love?‚Äù Have you found it, how can you find it if still deep in your heart you carry what cannot be spoken or said and in the middle of that desolated desert of your heart you still seek and not find. Open your eyes, let your ears hear and let me open your senses and you will find that answer, that still wonders in your heart. If it is not now then when says Jesus Christ in this day. Time and only time will reveal the truth that you are seeking for says the Lord of the Heights.  
  
But, today is a time to focus on what is essential, a time to pay attention, especially in details and decisions, see the pressure that is being applied, and focus on developing. I am attentive to even the smallest of details, honing to make things smoother and sharper, refining over a period of time. There has been so much written, so many details in full, and your yield to place attention, but today you realized the clinging noise, the clunking noise of the tambourines, yes, the high-pitched rattling sound¬†that carries well and fills with my water the wells around this place you call home.¬†

Look, listen, I see the most powerful as I see the one struggling, I hear the voice of the one singing, just as one of your favorite songs, ‚Äúas a poor young boy, he was summoned by the Magi to the Nativity of Jesus. Without a gift for the Infant, the little drummer boy played his drum with approval from Jesus's mother, Mary, recalling, ""I played my best for him"" and ""He smiled at me‚Äù. Oh Children of mine, listen just pay attention and listen to wave of the sounds, to the acts of how many instead of listening cautiously, listen to the variation in movements, in the stregnth of your voice, your intonation, let my Spirit move, opening your five senses. It is not the trauma that makes you, but it is in you just to pay attention so I may work in you and let you see what love is, oh my such change, such transformation says the Lord of the Heights. It is the melody, yes the melody which means ‚Äú a rhythmic succession of single tones organized as an aesthetic whole‚Äù¬† and let me be the one to do the tunning, a pleasing succession of musical tones, your frame of mind, your mood as you wish to see it. Do you know, that ‚Äúthe pitch and tone of a drum can be adjusted by tuning the drumhead?‚Äù.- a rotating shaft that drives tape at a constant speed in a recorder.¬† ‚ÄúA rotating shaft is defined as a component that restricts motion to rotation around its axis, enabling the conversion of energy forms into mechanical work and kinetic energy in devices like motors and engines.‚Äù Let me be the one who provides what affects, changing them into effects of the frequencies so you may vibrate in my frequency, where there is only love and peace, says the Lord. ¬†I am not here to influence, affect, or alter by indirect or intangible means, but I am here ‚Äúto have an effect on the condition or development of your heart.‚Äù But, where is love in all this? says the Lord, I am transforming from the youngest to the highest in age like the dancer that moves and shifts and through those movements changes are taken place.¬†

It is a time for meekness, a time for silence, a time to listen to the beating of your heart, just the drum setters¬† prepare their strike with their stick, so am I says Jesus Christ in this day preparing those who are in their will to surrender, there will a time to become, a time indicated by a clock, bell, or chime, a time to make known the time by sounding, you will hear, it is the changes that are transmitted to the drum shell and reflected back, and this action is repeated, creating a vibration, and the part that vibrates and amplifies the sound when the drumhead is struck.¬†In how it will resonate to your heart, you will find yourself seeking more and more living water. You see, it is ‚Äúthe ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on the very narrow windows of experience, that ‚Äúeasy come, easy go, but steady diligence pays off with an impulse to achieve.‚Äù It is in the simplest of Shephard from the tribe of the Lion and the Lamb. Today, there are tokens falling down from heaven. ""Tokens""(often rendered as ""signs"") are physical or visible reminders of spiritual truths, divine promises, and covenants, serving to strengthen faith and remind believers of God's ongoing relationship with humanity.‚Äù So you may understand in your language.¬†

You see, my children, I come to seek those who are hungry. Yes thee, thee who are hungry, but hungry for the most profound things of my Kingdom, of Me. And I, will fill their hunger and water their thirst. Those who hunger are those desperate for my word. Those who hunger do not want to go without being fed and their faith is so persistent that they will eat even the crumbles of bread. It is in those who know that one word may heal at a distance or at close, or just with a touch; I am here to fulfill the promise; I am here feeding food that you can only find in Me, and your plate will be full. A miracle cannot take place unless you are hungry, it is just that faith to know that with only one word, I can, and I will. That, says the Lord, yes that today is what I am seeking, my children that will go above and beyond that is hungry of what I want to place in him or her. Glory be to the Father, Glory be to Son, and Glory be to the Holy Spirit, it is here where I remind you today,¬† that it is my Spirit guiding, teaching, providing direction and distributing all the talents thar rests upon your heart between all of us, Faith is necessary throughout your walk in this terrain. Faith on our side, it is through weakness or in the middle of the storm,even truinfant. He provides us with the Strength and fortitude to accept his guidance. Yet, we are the ones who have free will, a choice to accept His guidance, obey Him or simply resist Him and turn off his guidance, advice, and power. We cannot water plants if the faucet is distant, we need a hose to connect to the faucet and let the water flow to the plants so they may bloom. In the same way it is how we connect, maintain and let the river flow to provide water for every single person to bloom.¬†

Serve, and you will see that serving is part of your inheritance, brave, in strength and resilient in adversity; seek passion in your heart. There are no mistakes, there are only challenges so you may rise again and again says the Lord. I will say again rise child of mine, seek me and you will find the answer that you have sought for so long. Be full and complete and let my power and authority be in your life says Jesus Christ in this day. There is love in obedience and guidance says the Lord in this day of grace, many rewards for the good, great power¬† for those who seek me in prayer for divine protection, I am and wll soon be providing answers. Find your self surrounded by inspiration, inspire others, provide hand to those who need, work on cooperation and fill yourself with courage. Be the heroes of the battle, and remember that in any battle that you are confronting, I am there, and there is great power that places away the impossible. Many, many have been selected to carry my armor, stand by and protect. Many signs in these coming times of trust and just feeling invincibility as my vows are sacred draw near to me. Do not look at the imperfection of man, the flawed condition of humanity, but in cheerfulness, take the weight off of the wearings of life and follow my instruction. Blessed are the ones that follow the law in heart¬† as my ways are known in such a sacred place.¬†

Just remember, the connection between Heaven and Earth, gradually I am coming to teach, providing for every single person, individual acquisition of knowledge, overcoming all challenges, opening the bridge , the pathway to this realm and the heavenly realm. Seek to move upward and let us walk together¬†

""The speaking Voice: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.-John 1:1

An intelligent plain man, untaught in the truths of Christianity, coming upon this text, would likely conclude that John meant to teach that it is the nature of God to speak, to communicate His thoughts to others. And he would be right. A word is a medium by which thoughts are expressed, and the application of the term to the Eternal Son leads us to believe that selfexpression is inherent in the Godhead, that God is forever seeking to speak Himself out to His creation.‚Äù¬†A.W. Tozer

Restoring the Creator -Creature Relation ‚ÄúIn determining relationships we must begin somewhere. There must be somewhere a fixed center against which everything else is measured, where the law of relativity does not enter and we can say ""IS"" and make no allowances. Such a center is God. When God would make His Name known to mankind He could find no better word than ""I AM."" When He speaks in the first person He says, ""I AM""; when we speak of Him we say, ""He is""; when we speak to Him we say, ""Thou art."" Everyone and everything else measures from that fixed point. ""I am that I am,"" says God, ""I change not."" A.W. Tozer¬†

The Importance of Worship.- Tozer wrote ‚ÄúWorship is to feel in your heart and express in some appropiate manner a humbling but delightful sense of admiring awe, astonished wonder, and overpowering love in presence of the most ancient. Mystery, that majesty which philosophers call the First Cause, but which we call Our Father in Heaven.‚Äù

Matthew 8:5-13 The Faith of the Centurion

5¬†When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him, asking for help.¬†6¬†‚ÄúLord,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúmy servant lies at home paralyzed,¬†suffering terribly.‚Äù

7¬†Jesus said to him,¬†‚ÄúShall I come and heal him?‚Äù

8¬†The centurion replied, ‚ÄúLord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.¬†9¬†For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me.

1 Corinthians 1 Christ Crucified Is God‚Äôs Power and Wisdom

18¬†For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 19¬†For it is written:

‚ÄúI will destroy the wisdom of the wise;  
the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.‚Äù\[c\]

20¬†Where is the wise person? Where is the teacher of the law? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world? 21¬†For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22¬†Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23¬†but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles, 24¬†but to those whom God has called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. 25¬†For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.

26¬†Brothers and sisters, think of what you were when you were called. Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth. 27¬†But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 28¬†God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things‚Äîand the things that are not‚Äîto nullify the things that are, 29¬†so that no one may boast before him. 30¬†It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God‚Äîthat is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. 31¬†Therefore, as it is written: ‚ÄúLet the one who boasts boast in the Lord.‚Äù\[d\]

Remember¬†

Please ignore the mess, it‚Äôs been a rough couple of weeks. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what to do with the left area of the kitchen (where window is) to make it look more‚Ä¶pleasant.

Right now it‚Äôs a coffee bar (cart from Amazon), we are big coffee drinkers so I plan to buy an espresso machine at some point. cabinet for cups (we are collectors so need the cabinet), a bench with drinks in the storage, and a show cabinet (next to garage entrance) for our winter shoes. Dining area is in a different place so I don‚Äôt need that. The little room next to garage entrance is a laundry room right now but we plan to convert it to a walk in pantry once we have saved the money, and move laundry downstairs. 

Just bought the house 8 month ago the previous owner had a dining set here, plus another in the area we currently use for dining. But I don‚Äôt need 2, there‚Äôd 2 of us only‚Ä¶

I was thinking a breakfast nook but idk what design, probably has to be custom as I want the window to be accessible, as it oversee an area of the yard dogs often play in, so I‚Äôm looking out there often. Thought about cabinets but we don‚Äôt rly need it if we convert that little room to walk in pantry, and again, need window to be accessible so I don‚Äôt wanna block it with a counter level table, maybe seats, like I wanna be able to lean into the window directly not over a counter tip toeing(I‚Äôm shor)",1,1742447614.0,HomeImprovement,1,1.0,False

Ravi, Sahil, and Karan stormed out of the exam hall like warriors returning from war.

""BOYSSSS!"" Ravi yelled. ""WE ARE FREE!""

""NO MORE NIGHT STUDY SESSIONS!"" Sahil screamed.

""NO MORE MATH!"" Karan shouted, throwing his calculator in the air like it was cursed.

The gang headed straight to their regular spot‚Äîa cheap caf√© where the coffee tasted like hot tap water but had free Wi-Fi. They had one mission: Plan the Ultimate Post-Board Life.

Step 1: Party Like Kings

Sahil slammed the table. ""Boys, first thing‚Äîhouse party. My parents are out next week.""

Karan grinned. ""Bro, make sure your neighbors don‚Äôt call the police like last time.""

""Relax, this time we‚Äôll keep it lowkey,"" Sahil smirked. ""Just some soft music, casual drinks‚Äî""

""‚Äîand twenty-five people breaking your furniture?"" Ravi interrupted.

""Bro, don‚Äôt kill the vibe!""

Step 2: Goa Plans (That Will Never Happen)

""Okay, serious talk‚ÄîGOA TRIP."" Karan declared.

Everyone nodded like wise philosophers. Goa after board exams was a sacred tradition.

""I've already told my parents I'm going for 'career counseling',"" Sahil said, doing air quotes.

""My parents will say no,"" Ravi sighed.

""Bro, just tell them you‚Äôre going for a meditation retreat,"" Karan suggested.

""Yeah, and when they see my Instagram stories with beer bottles?""

""Just tell them it's lemon soda.""

Step 3: The ‚ÄòGirlfriend‚Äô Discussion

""Bro, I‚Äôm telling you,"" Sahil said, ""Now that boards are over, girls will finally take us seriously.""

Ravi snorted. ""Yeah, because our math scores were the only reason they ignored us.""

""Exactly!""

Karan sighed. ""I just want a girlfriend who won‚Äôt leave me on 'seen'.""

""Bro, you‚Äôre asking for a miracle.""

Step 4: The Job Hunt (a.k.a. Realizing We're Broke)

""Okay, serious question,"" Ravi said. ""How are we funding all this? The party, the trip, the dates‚Ä¶?""

Everyone looked at each other.

""Pocket money?"" Sahil suggested.

""My dad barely gives me enough to buy Maggi,"" Karan groaned.

""What if we start a YouTube channel?"" Ravi said.

""Doing what?""

""Exposing school teachers?""

""Bro, we don‚Äôt want to die before college.""

Step 5: Reality Hits Hard

Just as they were about to finalize their plans, Ravi's phone buzzed.

MOM: Beta, coaching starts from Monday.

Sahil‚Äôs phone beeped.

DAD: I have enrolled you in JEE crash course. No break.

Karan gulped as he read his text.

MOM: We are visiting your relatives tomorrow to discuss your future. Be ready.

Silence.

The three boys stared at each other.

""Bro,"" Sahil whispered, ""Did we just escape one jail‚Ä¶ only to enter another?""

Ravi sighed. ""I think we just got scammed.""

And just like that, their dreams of Goa, parties, and girlfriends vanished into thin air.

Work from the office for a week. Is something Im really exited about. 

I was looking into getting a car or a motorbike but they are a lot more expensive than the plane ticket.

 A lot. 

I told my girlfriend about it and she began crying saying i don care about her.  Keep in mind that we dont live together. She is working on the same company but has stated ahe has no desire in doing more than necessary to get the minimum raise each year. She is living with her parents and deeply in debt for blowing credit in food and candy. 

I told her an event was coming up next may last year and she hasnt savev any money at all. She spent it on coffee, ice cream, burgers, etc. All because it was not that much money anyway.

She said couples should have trips together or not at all. That i didnt cate about her at all. She left angry cause I said sorry about hurting her but I didn't feel the same way she did about taking a plane on my own.

Keep in mind I do earn more than her but not enough to pay for both. I have been also buying food for her house, her dog and paying portions of her credit. She broke her phone for the second time and Im buying her one.

1. For one thing idk if he has a girlfriend or not üò≠. I‚Äôm not active on insta so I can‚Äôt check. I got a notif that he looked me up on linkedin tho  at like 8pm yesterday üëÄ. Could mean nothing tho üòî prob just that he‚Äôs curious about where I am in recruiting for internships since we talked about that 
2. I honestly don‚Äôt get a flirty vibe from him. Not that I‚Äôm giving off one either (bc idk how to flirt and #1 üò≠üíÄ). I think he‚Äôs treating me how he would treat any other girl [space] friend
3. I want to talk to our mutual friends about it but I don‚Äôt want to turn it into a whole thing in our club. I would be so mortified if it did‚Ä¶
4. I would love to ask him out for coffee or something sometime somewhere but back to #1 - #3 and I‚Äôve never asked anyone out ü´£
5. I think I would just die of embarrassment if he had to tell me he only sees me as a friend and then we have class together for 3 more months + see each other at club events this and next year

WELL IT DID. I went to a coffee shop with her and her roommate and their partner. Eventually it was just us and we were there and we studied. Then she ended up driving me back to my apartment and we parked and talked for a bit. Before I left, I told her I really liked it. She slowly nodded and said she felt the same. 

NEVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE. I've never liked anyone enough to ever confess my feelings. And now she likes me back? Low key I was so nervous and erratic that I started to tear up slightly and started apologizing LOLLL. But she found it cute I guess.

But what now? I guess I plan a date?? I'm still kind of off the high LMAO.",8,1742445067.0,QueerWomenOfColor,0,0.91,False
1jfgxfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1jfgxfk/adhd_and_difficulties_cooking_feeding_self/,ADHD and difficulties cooking / feeding self,"Does anyone else frequently have issues with feeding themselves? It seems like a daunting task sometimes. Sometimes I'll just sit feeling worse and hungrier but not eating anything because cooking seems insurmountable, I have a specific craving and the one thing I can focus on eating isn't available, or nothing available feels 'right' to eat at the moment. It's even worse at the end of the day after work when most all the executive function tokens have been cashed.

I can handle breakfast easy. I've been doing instant coffee, and oatmeal or granola with fruit. But cooking is unreliable. Some days it's fine. I'll meal prep lunches and then make tasty, healthy dinners. I have repeats and am a pretty good cook with an expansive palette. Other days I absolutely cannot get started cooking. I blank on what I can cook, the ingredients on my shelves these alien entities I can't fathom coming together in any way. Or I get icked out on the food I'd been planning to make and can't get myself to make it / already made and it sits there getting old because I feel like I'll throw up if I eat it. Other times, I'll find a recipe that works and make it a couple times until I get icked on it then I have to find something new because I will not touch it again.

I guess it's not as bad as it could be. And I'm getting better. But it's exhausting and makes me feel like a child. ",9,1742445019.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

Cinnamon belvita bites pack 

Cup of kefir

Strawberry applesauce (6oz?)

1 plain croissant

1 spinach croissant 

20 oz coffee

(Dont know how many but maybe like 1/4 cup) Almonds

(Maybe 1.5 cup) Sugar snap peas

(1/2 cup-ish)Peanuts

Probably had 8ish cups of water or so idk i never can keep track. 

I am full of anxiety and dread and self hate, i have felt like crying multiple times but it hasnt come out. I dont even want to post this cause you cant actually be anonymous on here but whatever. 
I feel like i am absolutely hated by everyone and annoying and just alone as fuck. I have been feeling like i need to throw up ever since i ate the peanuts for dinner. 

In reality i know i did get some calories for the day which is good. I just feel like its nothing, also my measurements are purely guesses. I woke up at 6am and its now 12:30 am and the last time i ate was around 8pm. 

I feel like everything i ate was not nearly enough, but when i tried to calculate calories it was too much. Yes i understand that these things are more caloric dense and thats fine. Honestly i just obsess over knowing the numbers now and it is something i used to not do but now i am doing it almost daily. 

I have no idea what im doing honestly. This day just really hurts. Physically in pain and mentally as well. 
At least i got a hug from someone while i was working.

Making this post feels dumb as fuck cause im just complaining but reddits just a place i come to vent sometimes but i dont even want to post at the same time cause i dont really want anyone to know all of this/nobody actually cares. I just wanted to get it out, even though it doesnt help either.

I had just finished working on my top ten most meaningful values for me to embody this morning. It was a contemplative process of uncovering what those 10 values personally mean, what would they look like tangibly in my life, and how I would know when I have embodied each one of 'em.

Went out of the gate to get my sun fasted with a mug of black coffee; Kindle is ready, andlo and behold: PIMIs from afar marching towards me, two men and two women. 

I pretended I didn't see them. The one taking the lead walk past me, surveying the block. 

The old dude tried to speak to me, though. I just shook my head passively. 

This dark tanned, sun-dyed hair surfer dude sunbathing while reading on the driveway could have been the one taking the lead among them.

I wonder how they would react if I had told them I went to BSSB/SKE but DAed last year. But it was not worth the scene, as they could see where I now live.

I still have the Memorial invitation slipped into the gate, though.

Armageddon may truly be close. 

Let it come, Lord Jesus; 

Amen and amen.

1jfgrth,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLawyers/comments/1jfgrth/wa_predatory_relationship_with_senior_manager/,[WA] Predatory relationship with senior manager resulting in pregnancy,"Hello, please bare with me as this is very difficult for me to write/reprocess but I am desperately seeking help. I am 29 years old she/her and my daughter is 4 months old located in Washington state. 

**Background:**
In September 2023, I was hired at an aerospace manufacturing company as a quality inspector. I previously worked there as a contractor for about 4.5 years. I worked so hard to get that job. I even took a pay cut. 

From September-November 2023, I worked at a site in Seattle. There I worked under manager who was very toxic. He accused his employees of time theft, he does not respect people‚Äôs property, he could not control his anger/ outbursts, and would withhold overtime from his employees if it meant he would have to finish the project himself. In order to escape from under him I put in a request to transfer to another site. 

December 2023 transfer request was approved. 

**Fast forward January 2024:**

Still new to the team and wanting to show that I am capable and thankful for the transfer. I tried everything with my best ability to assist my new manager. 

Our team was working on a proposal that needed senior level manufacturing managers approval. My manager instructed me to introduce myself and flirt with them to get the proposal approved since she was not able to get an immediate response. I was hesitant but it seemed possible after her coaching and that it could greatly help our team (if proposal was approved). 

I sent the senior manager an IM introducing myself and he immediately invited me to his desk. 
Even with my first encounter with him was very off. He was caressing my hand and positioned his chair very close to mines. I felt uncomfortable but I‚Äôve been in worse situations before so I shook it off. When discussing the proposal he was gear the conversation towards him. He stated he‚Äôs new to town and has no friends or family in Washington. Which made me feel really empathetic. He said he would look over the proposal if I could exchange phone numbers with him if any questions were to arise regarding proposal and I said sure. Later that evening he asked if we could have dinner sometimes and I said we could grab a coffee at the cafeteria or something hoping to not prolong the conversation. 

Few days goes by and my manager told me the proposal still has not been approved and asked if I could follow up with him. I shared with her that he has texted me and asked me out to dinner but I politely declined. She said ‚Äúyou should give him a chance, it could benefit us all‚Äù. Also during this time he would show up with gifts, flowers, and lunch to my desk. I still wasn‚Äôt interested but my manager pointed out his effort and liking for me. I was thankful for the consideration and effort and it felt nice to be pursued so I finally gave in and gave him a chance. 

Fast forward,

After the date he kept pressuring me to come inside his apartment in which I declined. And everyday he would invite me over to his apartment. I finally accepted his invite after a week since we got off around the same time. To this day I regret accepting his invite. 

That night I felt still haunts me. I remember getting very tired after 1 drink and I felt drunk but sedated if that makes sense. He insisted I spent the night since it was late and I that he lived very close to work and I agreed since I felt very weird. At one point I remember waking up to him caressing my body, followed by him kissing my body. I remember I was still on my menstrual cycle that night and I kept on saying no I‚Äôm not ready. Not tonight. And pushing him off. He said that it‚Äôs fine we‚Äôre going to be in a relationship and that‚Äôs what people in relationships do and he knows I‚Äôve had sex before so why not now? 

In my head I‚Äôve always longed for a relationship and he‚Äôs been so kind and put so much effort in courting me so this doesn‚Äôt make him bad. Therefore I justified it as being ok for me to feel ok. 

Everyday since that night he would insist on me coming over. This lasted for about 3 weeks before I decided to end things. I did not appreciate how secretive he was. He would act like he didn‚Äôt know me at work and when confronted he would say he didn‚Äôt see me.  He would disappear for days at a time with no response. That night after work I went to his place to end things and he apologized and pulled me back in. The next morning he kept saying the only way he‚Äôs so successful in life is because he pressures things. If things aren‚Äôt up to par at work he work pressure until he can get it. Even if it means disciplinary actions. 

**Fast forward 1 month later**

 I find out I am pregnant while at work. then things started to unravel. I found out through Facebook that he has 4 kids and a long time girlfriend living in another state. When I met him he lied and stated he was single with no kids. I also found out he was fired for sexual misconduct from his last job and gotten 7 different women pregnant within the last couple of years. When confront he physically abused me and threaten my life and job said it was my fault for not minding my business. Also my manager shared with my old manager of my pregnancy and he went around asking ‚Äúwho my baby daddy was?‚Äù

I made a police report and obtained a restraining order. 

I brought this information to HR and ethics but they dismissed my claims stating these accusations occurred off property therefore it is not company‚Äôs responsibility. My intent was to save someone else from experiencing what I did.  

I was pressured to abort my baby but I kept my daughter. Not out of spite or malice with no support. 

Where I am now is I am currently seeking therapy from trauma and I am set to return to work soon since my maternity is coming to an end. I am not sure how to proceed with returning back to work.
