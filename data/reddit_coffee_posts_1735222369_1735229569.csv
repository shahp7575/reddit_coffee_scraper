1hmrgfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgingParents/comments/1hmrgfg/moving_mom_into_a_retirement_mobile_home/,Moving Mom into a Retirement Mobile Home community. It's happening and I'm nervous about it all. ,"To start - yes, I know buying a mobile home in a park and paying lot rent is not a winning proposition financially. I'm not concerned with an inheritance, I just want my mom to be happy and comfortable as she gets older. 

I live about 70 miles away from my mom. Moved away 15 years ago right after college; there just wasn't any work in that area and I didn't want to spend my life working minimum wage jobs in retail and fast food. For the past 15 years, I've been visiting multiple times per month as I can.

Last summer, dad passed away after a long battle with Alzheimer's. My mom is a lot younger than he was (she's late 60s now) and apart from mobility issues, she's in pretty good shape. She tries to keep on top of things with the doctor. Eats healthy, tries to walk in the house for at least 30 minutes a day even with bad knees.

After my father passed, I was kind of relieved for her. I was hoping that her friends would come and see her a lot . It didn't really happen. The one friend and one relative who were seeing her all through my father's illness were the only two that were seeing her afterwords.

The relative had become my mom's sidekick. Over the last 8 years as she lost her husband, then my mom lost her husband, these two became very close. They saw each other multiple times a day - only living 4 houses apart. Coffee every morning, grocery shopping, wine every night.

Earlier this month, the relative died suddenly. My mom has no one that she sees consistently any more. That worries me as that's how  they start declining. She has been driving to see all of her friends but during winter she is afraid to travel. Thankfully, she just got two new cats and they have been occupying her.

A few months ago, we were in the process of buying a lot with the intention to place a modular home on it for her to live in. Unfortunately that fell through. But since she had the cousin stopping in multiple times a day and going shopping with her, I didn't really worry too much.

However, now that I think we're all at the realization that life is short and even someone who is healthy can just pass away ... she wants to move out IMMEDIATELY.  Houses here really are exceeding what a comfortable budget is for her and a multi story house with a basement wouldn't work anyway due to mobility issues.

I brought up a retirement trailer park near us and she quickly jumped on the opportunity. We're now in the process of her buying a brand new singlewide mobile home with a warranty. Everything checks out , too. I ran through inspection items and it's very well built.

I worry that I'm being selfish by having her move close. We will be seeing her almost every day --- mom loves to cook and I don't have time for it, my fiancé doesn't cook. My fiancé and mom get along famously so we'll be going back and forth to watch TV shows and stuff.

My concerns - and what has been stressing me is moving her away from her previous 60+ years of life. She doesn't get to see friends now as it is, but she will have to drive out to see them now ... or they will have to come and see her.

She is going to have to learn a new area. Get new doctors. Change banks. Sell the house that's been in the family for 100 years (it's falling down so no big loss objectively). No more garage that she can store stuff and paint furniture. She'll be living in a 13x42 mobile home with a 10x12 shed on a tiny lot.

Her house sale should cover the cost of the trailer home fully. And leave some left over. She does OK on SS and has various retirement accounts that she is not going to touch. I have made sure to tell her that if she wants something, do not think about saving the money for me and that she needs to enjoy the money for herself. 

One plus is --- she DOES NOT get attached to items like I do. Yesterday we went and started helping her decide what she wants and doesn't want because she's cutting her living space by 1/3. Almost everything is in a donate pile that we went through. 

I'm going to be a mile away. If she wants to have a big garden, I have an acre. If she wants to refinish furniture like she says, I have a garage she can use. Most of her friends are still *only* a 90 minute drive, at most. 

Someone tell me I'm doing the right thing. This has been stressing me out bigtime for the last week or so since we started this process. I don't think I've had a single good night of sleep.",1,1735229334.0,AgingParents,0,1.0,False

I confronted but never asked to look into their messages, he said that there were some flirtatious messages between them and they were still texting each other on a daily basis after he told me he will stop interacting with her

1hmr8yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/hygge/comments/1hmr8yq/hey_hyggespreaders_i_have_something_you_may_be/,Hey Hyggespreaders! - I have something you may be interested in.,"I've been asked a few times by people on here if I'd ever set up a website for Hygge, or a place to sell hygge goods and my response was always a resounding ""no.""  
I didn't want to be involved in sales and deal with the hassle of distribution, and the stress of needing to make sales to stay afloat. I also wasn't impressed with the dropshipping options given either.  
My main reason for not wanting to create a website was probably because I thought I'd have to do it all on my own.  
I thought, *'I can't ask for any help, cos who would want to deal with the stress of sales for* ***FREE***\*?'\* And so on.

# The Idea:

A completely *community-drive*n publication for all things Hygge. We will have the aim of being just a cozy corner of the internet where like-minded writers, bloggers, and hygge enthusiasts come together to share their passion for Hygge. A place where we can *all* pull together and create a place of feel-good stories, home improvement tips, and inspiring ideas to make  your life more hygge. We will spread Hygge propaganda! *(We shall expand our* *~~cult~~* *cozy club as far and wide as possible!)* Some of you completely live and breathe the hygge lifestyle, and others wish to do so. Our publication is created by and for the Hygge community and we will ensure that every article, DIY tutorial, Top X list, and story is infused with the spirit of Hygge and resonates with our readers. With *multiple* writers contributing, there'll be a good range of viewpoints, styles, and expertise from people of all walks of life which will make our submissions more authentic and relateable in more places. One of the beautiful things about r/Hygge is that it can be interpreted differently by everyone. While there are some common elements associated with hygge, such as coziness, comfort, and togetherness, the specific activities and experiences that create a *hyggelig* feeling can vary greatly from person to person:

* **^(For some - a cozy night in with loved ones, with extra fluffy socks, hot chocolate, soft blankets, and good conversation.)**
* **^(For others - the simple pleasures of nature; a leisurely walk in the woods or a picnic by the lake.)**

# Why visit our publication?

You should come and visit us if you wish to:

* ^(Discover new ideas and inspiration to make your life more Hygge💡)
* ^(Connect with like-minded individuals who share your passion for cozy living💬)
* ^(Enjoy a curated selection of feel-good stories, tips, and articles from a diverse range of writers that all represent the Hygge subreddit📑)
* ^(Support a community-driven publication that values authenticity, creativity, and inclusivity✅)
* ^(Find a place that aims to be free of anything that could be a source of negativity🚫)
* ^(It is somewhere you can visit at bed time) *^(knowing)* ^(you'll be going to sleep with a more positive mindset, with thoughts of the cozy!)🕯️

# Why should I write for this publication?

***^(Why bother, you ask? Well, if you enjoy writing then why not?)***  
You should write for Hygge because:

* ^(it'll be the perfect place to share your love of Hygge with others who) *^(understand)* ^(and appreciate the lifestyle.)
* ^(You'll have the opportunity to build your portfolio, establish yourself as a writer, and gain recognition within the Hygge community and beyond.)
* ^(You'll be able to connect with other likeminded writers, bloggers, enthusiasts, and readers who share your interests and passions.)
* ^(We believe in) *^(fairness)* ^(among our writers. If we do monetise, you will be paid 100% what your articles generate, and) \*\*^(NO LESS)\*\*^(.)
* ^(Any tips you make on a post/article are) \*\*^(100% yours)\*\*^(.)
* ^(If you have never written for a publication before, you can get non-judgemental advice and help, and tips from more established writers.)

There'd be no pressure for anybody, come and go as you please. For now, it's voluntary, no pressure, no time constraints, and the only limits to your writing are to not make it about anything negative, ie. crime, politics and ONLY write about good news stuff and home improvement or Hygge things! Everywhere is bad news. All sites are just pushing bad news most of the time. l

I wanted to stick with ""Hygge"" being in the name somehow, so I considered options like HyggeHub, HyggeCollective or MyHygge. However, some some people made me warm up to the idea of having ANY kind of name. It doesn't really matter, it'd still be the official publication of Hygge subreddit, and it'll link TO and FROM it,

To give you an idea of what the publication will contain, every person who mentioned it said they'd like to see a feel-good, Hygge-focused publication with no doom and gloom or political commentary. They'd like to see feel-good stories, home improvement tips, and lists of ways to make things more Hygge. The publication would feature multiple writers from r/Hygge, and they could contribute whenever they feel like it, without any time constraints or pressure. If an article gets tips, the writer would receive the full amount. I don't care about making money; I just want to create something nice that's attached to this community, where writers can share their work, and readers can visit when they've had a bad day and need a pick-me-up.

Here are some domain name options I've found:

* Hyggestund (Cozy Hour in Danish)
* Kokoro (Japanese word for heart or spirit)
* Mysa (Swedish word meaning ""to cozy up to"")
* MyHygge
* HyggeAndFika - (Fika is a Swedish concept that refers to a coffee break, but it's much more than just grabbing a cup of coffee. It's a social ritual that involves taking a break from your day to relax, socialize, and enjoy a cup of coffee or tea with a sweet treat like a pastry or cake.)
* HyggeHouse
* HyggeAndHome
* Hyggehub
* CozyCartel

This is an example, but this is how it would look in the banner on the site:

>Hyggestund .com  
The official publication of r/Hygge

# DID YOU LIKE ANY OF THE NAMES ABOVE? DID ANY STAND OUT TO YOU?

# If not, what other names could we add to that list to choose from? Fire away - as many as you have.

If you're interested in being added as a writer, let me know. I'd rather you contact me through email or discord than Reddit messenger. I don't like it it's too slow and confuses the shit out of me.

1hmr8w4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hmr8w4,Fill my Persona4G void and let’s chat. Just beat the game idk what to do anymore,"P5Royal was my intro to the Persona series, I loved it and spent 195 hours, played P3P and I spent like 60 hours before dropping it. P4Golden was finished 140 hours and has by far been my favorite cast to play as. 

I LOVED my team so much, some more than others, but I thought the cast was genuinely a great fit and had really good chemistry and funny ass banter. I loved spending time with my group and strengthening the social links and I was a bit sad I didn’t complete all of them but I did most of them- gives me a solid reason to go back to the game for NG+

The minor card social links were a little lackluster, like hanging out with Yumi was a chore and the Konishi kid I barely bothered with amongst others. Ai was just so bratty I was very surprised to learn she liked Kou 😆 was kind of bummed I didn’t see through wing man more of that relationship

TV world - I liked this approach compared to tatarus and mementos just because the setting changed a bit. Climbing up mementos wasn’t as fun as getting through someone’s mind from a TV and seeing how their world was interpreted lol and the tribulations we helped our mates face was very touching for all and I was able to relate in some way. 

Battle was decent. Favorite critical hit animation has got to be Naotos pistol and HIIYAAA beat down & Yukikos fan beat down. The thing that annoyed me tho were the fucken golden hands but that’s pretty much a given. Fighting Marie….lackluster. I was expecting more for the last hoo-rah but I’m glad it wasn’t too complicated cuz I was getting a little tired of anticipation of the end. The hardest most annoying battle was the fucken Roblox Minecraft world / block bot lmao 

Coffee shop and other activities  - didn’t really understand or utilize. It dawned on me too late in the game to gather cards from my personas. Fishing was annoying and I barely understood the gist of catching bugs lol I was trying to get the legendary fish for the old man but I was never able to. I am a big item hoarder so gardening was pretty pointless for me but I did enjoy spending time with Dojima and Nanako while gardening. 

As for ADACHI - MAAAAAAAAAAANNN okay so I knew he looked off when I first met him but I shrugged it off. I even thought to myself “watch this guy is the culprit” but then shrugged it off cuz he played the lazy idiot scheme so wellllll it was kind of charming 😆 it was def the voice acting for sure cuz I found him sexy at times and I was shocked to see the ugly real side of him. I even spent some time with him and let his punk ass inside my uncles house, fed him and he goes and does that to my baby sis ?! Yeah I was offended. I learned from P3 to never let your guard down lmfao be sus of EVERYONE lmaooo but still Adachi being the culprit was great I was fooled 🤟🏼

My Romances: Yukiko & Marie
I did both 😅 this was very hard because I really loved Rise and how forward she was with her feelings for everything but I loved Yuki from the jump. How reserved and sweet she was and her laughing spurts were fucken amazing and I loved how her and Chie would hassle the guys for being stupid 🩴 Marie I just wanted to protecc her she was a brat but getting to know her was worth it in the end. And she was the only one that went in for a kiss 🧐 which I thought was interesting. If I was allowed to date a guy in Persona I probably would have chosen Kanji or Yosuke. My next run I will prob try for Rise or Naoto ❤️

Dojima - compared to Sojiro, I can’t choose who I love more. I thought Sojiro was a better father figure, but Dojima had some great moments of being there for me like I love how he gave me the scooter and supported me when he learned I did good in school and obviously recognized how much I was there for Nana-chan. I didn’t get to max out his social link but I got pretty close to figuring out about his wife it seems. 

MUSIC - fucking. Brilliant. Favorite tracks - Heaven and heartbeat heartbreak off the top of my head. The whole OST is immaculate.

At least that's the plan.

While that doesn't happen, I'm still living with my parents and I try to make my mother spend as little as possible on me. Everyday of school I have to ask my mother for a bit of money for a cup of coffee, once in a while I go out with my friends and can only drink a cup of coffee too with them because that's as far as my mother is willing to spend on my leisure and social life. Sometimes she even complains that I should just sleep better or drink coffee at home so she won't spend on that either.

I spent the whole year not buying anything for myself, only food or snacks once in a while because I have some compulsion for junk food (unhealthy, I know). 

Although sometimes I get upset -- she's constantly saying she has no money to spend on me, even though there's always money for everything else -- I accept that and understand, it's her hard-earned money. I see how she works hard everyday. Not my business. Her reasoning for not giving me a monthly allowance is that I am unable to save money, because if I waste it on anything she deems as unnecessary, then that means I cannot save money. 


That's why I applied for a student scholarship and got accepted, received my first payment one week ago but decided not to tell my mother because I know she will lecture me about not spending it on anything and save it all for my internship exchange program.

Then today she asked to see my bank account and I prepared myself for the 'talk' we would inevitably have when she sees that 0,05% of the scholarship money is gone in things I bought for myself, the first time in a long time. I deem the things I bought not exactly fundamental for my existence, but sure things that make my life better and more entertaining. But of course she said they weren't necessary and kept inquiring why I bought that. 

Anyway, she told me I was a becoming a little liar for keeping from her that I received my scholarship money and we had a little fight. Because apparently me having my own money, even if it's government money, and keeping that fact to myself is an attack on her. She then proceeded to look at my bank history, I asked her if she thought that was normal, she said 'yes'.

I love my mother dearly, I know she did/does a lot for me but I know she also thinks I've not accomplished enough for my age and wasted my former educational opportunities and she doesn't believe in my ability to ever be independent because of a previous psychotic depression episode that made me really dependent on her care, which I'm very thankful for. I'm receiving help and I am much better now.

I can't give the whole context of our relationship, the story is long, it's not the first or last time she invades my privacy. At this age, I am still learning to set boundaries but when she talks calmly to me about how I think I'm always right and talking to me is difficult, she understands this or that way more than me because she's older and has experience, while I talk more louder or harshly because I get offended by the invasion and exasperated by the uncomfortable talk, I can't help but think I'm the wrong one and don't treat her right. 

I'm posting here because I feel like it's the best community for that. I don't think my mother is entitled per se, but these situations hurt me and make me even less willing to develop a better rapport and share my personal life with her, as much as I want to.

I thought the friendship was perfect. Everything was so fun and then it just started to come to me.

I had been dealing with MONTHS of this frustration, and I even found out that they might be talking crap about me but I just brushed that one off as rumors because they're not that insensitive and if they are good riddance, I'm not doing anything about it 


So to calm my nerves, I took a break from the group for about 1- 2 1/2 weeks until Thursday. I talked to this girl I've been friends with for a couple years and she chose to say some words to me. And that's what I was looking for I felt good on the inside.

I even Went with her and one of the girls who asked for personal space and we both tried to get my friends, twin brother out of his nutshell and go dance with somebody because we had a dance on the last day before winter break 

But recently, I've been having dreams about this friend will call her Clara because that's REALLY similar to her real name

So in the first dream, which was the day before yesterday, the dream started off on a green grassy field that kinda looked like the one from our school, and in the dream she had dyed her hair ginger and for some reason, she wanted me to give her a massage to loosen her muscles and then she felt a lot better and then she started performing

Now I find this really weird because Clara is the literal stereotype of a typical cheerleader she's blonde, has long hair, lots of stamina to run around, athletic, trendy, stylish, and popular too and I don't think going, Ginger is something that she would do and her hair was also shorter than the dream and so if her hair did go short, she would have to get extensions so I don't know what that dream was trying to tell me, but all I know is that it's probably some sign

The second dream which was yesterday: she was doing back walkovers on a mat yet again in a grassy field that looks like our school except it was more of a hangout spot and she was doing cartwheels and stuff and I was giving her a round of applause and we were having an awesome conversation

 I don't remember much of that dream but she was looking like herself and something like this did happen so I don't know why the past is repeating itself

And the dream I had last there was a part where she did show up. I was staring at her talking to our friend group and then she made eye contact with me back and she gave me a strange look which I know is a reflex. And then I got sent into the dark black pitch, staring at my body and confusion and then words were just echoing around me like. ""it's not what you think."" ""they're just thoughts."" ""you'll get over it."" ""You're overthinking it."" ""they're all just negative thoughts trying to get you down."" Referring to the thoughts of me thinking they don't care anymore and then I snapped out of my trans in the dream and me and Clara once again we were looking at each other, but this time little by little my other friends began to stare at me and I remember trying to cover myself up and I don't remember much after that, but they were waving at me and smiling as soon as I did 

I don't know what that was referring to, but I think it means that I don't have to tense up at the thought thinking that they don't care about me

And I'm Christian so I feel like this could be connected with God, but I just don't know how to respond back especially because of similar dream with Clara happened, but I don't know if I should get into that 

And as far as my other friends, they're all fine I guess I was just more concerned about Clara because like I said earlier, she has a twin brother and I've known that twin brother since preschool. The only reason why I didn't hang out with Clara back then was because she was going to a different preschool. I don't know why. But I've known her since around preschool and I've been friends with her since third grade

Her and all of my friend group, for that matter literally saved me from being known as the ""weird kid"" forever

And me and her had this moment on her birthday, where we were hanging out on this little baseball field that my school has and the thing about being popular is that you're compelled to fit in, but that moment I just released everything and told her about how I'm interested in anime And that Starbucks isn't real food It's just coffee and I don't get the hype as a coffee lover.

And she responded like ""yeah well technically, I watch anime because anime is just animated movies kind of and Starbucks isn't real food that's why I was mad when people were asking about it on my birthday party. I was the birthday girl and I wanted to say I wanted Chick-fil-A but I'm sorry I didn't invite you to my party. It was just too many car rides."" no I didn't take the car rides apart as an excuse, especially because. I have a level two cerebral palsy (I used to think it was three, but I was after some treatment it was a level 2) and my dad even reassured me that even though one of my friends, mom's deals with special needs they might not have been going in the same car and we're scared for my safety


The thing about some people in America, is that once your children are hanging out with other children you're responsible for those children and if anything happens, they're gonna put the blame on you and it's either jail time or court or both

But that could just be a stereotype idk my dad told me that I don't know about the American court system. I don't like history and my dad isn't from America

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maintaining good oral health is essential, and we often look for effective ways to enhance our dental hygiene. However, some ideas can be harmful instead of helpful. One such misconception is the idea of brushing your teeth with bleach. While bleach is known for its disinfecting properties, it has no place in your oral care routine. Let’s explore the dangers associated with this practice and why it's important to choose safe alternatives for dental hygiene.

### The Harmful Effects of Bleach on Teeth

Bleach contains chemicals such as sodium hypochlorite, which is used as a powerful cleaner and disinfectant. When used inappropriately, it can lead to several problems:

- **Enamel Damage:** The enamel is the protective outer layer of your teeth. Using bleach can erode the enamel, making your teeth more susceptible to decay and sensitivity.
- **Gum Irritation:** Bleach can cause inflammation and burning of the gums. This irritation may lead to gingivitis or other gum diseases.
- **Staining:** Ironically, while some use bleach to whiten teeth, it can result in uneven discoloration or further staining, especially in conjunction with other substances.
- **Tissue Damage:** If bleach accidentally comes into contact with soft tissues in your mouth, such as your cheeks or tongue, it can cause severe burns and ulcers.

### Understanding Oral Health Risks

Brushing your teeth with bleach is not only ineffective but also potentially dangerous. Beyond the immediate harms to your mouth, there are several long-term effects to consider:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### 1. Increased Sensitivity

When the enamel wears away due to bleach usage, your teeth can become highly sensitive to hot, cold, and sweet substances. This condition leads to discomfort during everyday activities like eating and drinking.

#### 2. Higher Decay Risk

Enamel is your first line of defense against cavities. Weakening it with bleach makes your teeth more vulnerable to decay. Ignoring this risk can lead to significant dental issues and costly treatments down the line.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
#### 3. Oral Cancer Concerns

While studies linking bleach directly to oral cancer are limited, its corrosive nature can indeed harm oral tissues. Continued exposure may raise concerns about mutagenic effects, emphasizing the importance of avoiding bleach at all costs for oral hygiene.

### Safer Alternatives for Whitening Your Teeth

If you're looking to achieve a whiter smile without risking your oral health, there are many safer alternatives:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Over-the-Counter Whitening Toothpastes:** These products contain mild abrasives and safe bleaching agents that can help gently remove stains.
- **Whitening Strips:** Look for approved products that are designed for daily use and have been tested for safety.
- **Professional Whitening Treatments:** Consult your dentist for supervised and effective whitening procedures tailored to your needs.
- **Naturally Whitening Foods:** Foods like strawberries and apples can help brighten your teeth due to their natural enzyme content.

### Consulting Your Dentist

Whenever considering a new dental hygiene product or method, it’s best to consult with your dentist. They can provide guidance tailored to your dental needs and recommend safe alternatives for a brighter smile.

Maintaining your oral health is vital, and safety should always come first. Brushing your teeth with bleach is a dangerous myth that can lead to irreversible harm. Instead, opt for proven methods that promote healthy teeth and gums while achieving the white smile you desire.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Remember, your mouth is delicate, and using harsh substances like bleach could endanger your overall health. Keeping your teeth clean and white is certainly possible, but it should always be done in a safe and sensible manner.

Safe Alternatives to Bleach for Teeth Whitening and Oral Hygiene
----------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to maintaining a bright smile, many people consider various teeth whitening methods. One substance that often comes up in discussions is bleach. You might be wondering, can you brush your teeth with bleach? While it’s tempting to think that using bleach may provide fast results, it’s important to highlight the potential risks involved. Instead, let's explore safe and effective alternatives that can help you achieve a brighter smile without damaging your teeth or gums.

### Natural Teeth Whitening Alternatives

There are several natural ingredients that can help whiten your teeth and improve your oral hygiene without the harsh effects of bleach. Here are some popular options:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Baking Soda:** This common household item is mildly abrasive, making it effective for removing surface stains. Mix it with a little water to create a paste and use it as a toothpaste, but don’t overuse it as it can wear down enamel if used excessively.
- **Activated Charcoal:** This ingredient can absorb toxins and impurities. Brushing with activated charcoal may help lift stains. However, be cautious and don’t use it too often as it can also be abrasive.
- **Coconut Oil:** Known for its antimicrobial properties, coconut oil can help kill harmful bacteria in your mouth. Swishing with coconut oil, a process called oil pulling, may also help whiten your teeth gently over time.
- **Lemon Juice:** The natural acidity in lemon juice can whiten teeth. However, due to its acid content, it’s crucial to limit its use to prevent enamel erosion. Always rinse your mouth with water after using lemon juice.

### Over-the-Counter Whitening Products

If you’re looking for convenience and effectiveness, over-the-counter whitening products might be a great choice. Here’s a list of some popular options:

- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Many brands offer whitening toothpaste that contains mild abrasives and stain removers. These can help maintain a brighter smile when used regularly.
- **Whitening Strips:** These thin, flexible strips are coated with a whitening gel. They adhere to your teeth and gradually lighten them over several days. Follow the instructions carefully for safety and effectiveness.
- **Whitening Gels and Trays:** These products are usually stronger than strips. They come with custom or generic-fit trays that hold the gel against your teeth. Make sure to talk to your dentist about proper usage.

### Professional Whitening Treatments

If you’re seeking immediate and significant results, professional treatments are the way to go. Here are a couple of options offered by dental professionals:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-office Whitening:** Dentists can apply a stronger whitening agent that delivers faster results in a single visit. This method is highly effective and safe when performed under professional supervision.
- **Custom Take-home Kits:** Your dentist can provide custom-fitted trays and stronger whitening gel for at-home use. This option allows you to whiten your teeth on your schedule while still being safer than DIY methods.

### Maintaining Oral Hygiene

While whitening methods can enhance your smile, maintaining good oral hygiene is equally important. Here are some tips to keep your teeth healthy and white:

- **Brush Regularly:** Brush your teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste to remove plaque and keep your teeth strong.
- **Floss Daily:** Flossing helps remove food particles and plaque from areas that your toothbrush can’t reach, preventing decay and gum disease.
- **Limit Stain-Causing Foods:** Be mindful of foods and drinks that can stain your teeth, such as coffee, tea, and red wine. If you indulge, rinse your mouth with water afterward to minimize staining.
- **Visit the Dentist Regularly:** Routine check-ups can help catch any dental issues early and provide professional cleanings to brighten your smile.

Ultimately, while bleach may seem like a quick solution for whitening teeth, it poses risks that outweigh its benefits. Instead, consider these safe and effective alternatives for a dazzling smile. A healthy mouth is not just about appearance, but also about your overall well-being. Choose the methods that feel right for you and maintain your beautiful smile!

### Conclusion

Brushing your teeth with bleach poses significant health risks that are best avoided. The harsh chemicals found in bleach can cause irritation to your gums, lead to sensitive teeth, and even damage the enamel, increasing your risk for cavities and other dental issues. Understanding these dangers is crucial for maintaining good oral health.

I am currently looking for penpals to talk to over email to practice writing to each other in Spanish! I'm currently at a high A1/A2 level of speaking, writing, and reading in Spanish and I want to improve my writing and reading abilities. It would be wonderful to have other people interested in improving their Spanish to talk to!

A little bit about me: I am currently a graduate student, so I am very busy reading and writing all the time! I love to watch films, specifically arthouse type of films and horror. I love animals and nature, and I love to write about them as well (my favourite animal is a cuttlefish, and my favourite bug is an acorn weevil). I'm a very anxious person, but I feel like I shine more by myself, either behind a screen or simply listening to others. I also LOVE coffee. I am also half Chilean but never fully learned Spanish.

here’s the kicker: at the start of the week, they basically bragged about always being the one to make the first move. and yeah, some of their texts were bold enough to back that up. but after they hit me with that last 🩷 radio silence.

do they expect me to text and be like, ‘hey, what’s up? weren’t we supposed to be on a date today?’ nah, i’m good. if you can’t even follow through with a text after hyping yourself up as mr./ms. first move, i’m just gonna assume you’re not interested.

1hmqr79,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hmqr79/the_one_who_fiddles/,The one who fiddles...,"I was alone, laying in my bed underneath the snow white sheets; a nice, cool saturday night.. My phone screen, illuminating the dark room in a blueish-white tint, revealed something concealed within the shadows.. I gasped, quickly shinning my only source of light out towards the possible intruder, but nothing came of it. 'I must be overtired', I thought to myself. 
I lay my head down on my pillow, and close my heavy eyelids..

But something was off. 

A strange, dreadful feeling convulsed inside me, and a feeling, reminiscent of cold, wet ice cubes sliding down my back overtook me.. 

I felt a fiddling in my undergarments... And at this point, I knew the cruel fate that awaited for me.
The foreskin fiddler was here, and he was feeling fiddly. He's come for the pickle, and he will ALWAYS yank on your snizzle... Pure evil. A true monster of the night. But unluckily for the creature, I had a trick up my sleeve.. I had no sleeve.... I was circumcised. I smiled, 'checkmate'. The creature, slowly unbuckled my pants, revealing the truth.. It was shocked, never before, has it mistaken a circism for a uncircism. It snarled furiously, and retreated into the darkness. Satisfaction overcame me, as I proudly pulled up my pants and shut my eyes for some well deserved rest. 

This morning, in a groggy state, I shuffled to my breakfast nook, preparing myself for another day at the office. I took out a instant coffee container, and began boiling some water. While I was waiting, I noticed something strange in the corner of my eye, that familiar sense of dread washed over me. I shifted my eyes quickly to the source of the disturbance, only to see not the creature, but a note sloppily pinned to the wall. While recovering from the shock of this strange discovery, I forgot to tend to the boiling water, and it overflowed onto the kitchen floor. I quickly run to the kettle and take it off the heat. 

It's toying with me, it's all part of its sick game.. With shaking hands, I decided to open the crudely folded note; written in blood, (I presume foreskin blood) it read in blotchy red letters: ""Where is your foreskin, Alex?"" Out of anger, frustration and fear, I crumbled up the paper and threw it aganist the wall. I began to scream with rage, as I kicked over my trash can and swiped my framed pictures and paintings off the walls of my house. Afterwards, I collapsed in a heap on the ground, and sobbed quietly.

I wrote a story in this reddit group a few days ago about a woman ghosting me on a date. No-one talked about one of the most important parts of the story...i was on bumble for a year!

So a year ago after i became single i was doing the bar/club scene. It was great for hookups and getting laid. I wanted more after a while and wanted to go out on some dates to find something serious. A few guys at my job recommended bumble. Now let me back track, i would more than anything love to meet a single woman i connect with in the real world. I work with all men, i have all seniors and families living around me and i am in a few outside of work activities but they have all men in them. I have even asked my male friends if they or their wives/gf's know of any single female friends and they always say no. 

So trying bumble out and i am getting matches all the time. Getting matches is not the problem for me personally. The problem is the matches will not talk back. I will say something witty about their profile to start the convo off. They have 24 hours to respond back....silence and then we are unmatched because 24 hours came and went and nothing was said from them. It's been like this all year long with me on bumble. I had one woman a few weeks ago actually talk back and we hit it off well. She planned a date with me and i went to meet her at a coffee shop and she blocked me on text and social media while i was waiting for her to show up in the coffee shop. So that was the one woman that talked to me all year on bumble.

I see women post in here all the time of conversations they have with men. I find it so weird is this just my area or are any other men going through the same thing where the women just do not say a word back?",3,1735226498.0,Bumble,7,1.0,False

My girlfriend recently discovered Skibidi Toilet, and she’s become completely obsessed with it. At first, it was funny—she’d randomly say “Skibidi” or refer to random things as “Skibidi this” or “Skibidi that.” But now it’s constant, and honestly, it’s starting to drive me nuts.

For example, we were out getting coffee the other day, and she pointed at a plant and said, “Look, it’s a Skibidi plant.” The barista looked at us like we were crazy. Then, last night while we were watching a movie, she kept humming the Skibidi song during serious scenes, which completely ruined the vibe. She even started calling me “Skibidi boyfriend” as a joke, and I don’t even know what that’s supposed to mean.

I’ve tried to laugh it off, but it’s getting really exhausting. I feel like I can’t have a normal conversation with her without her throwing in something Skibidi-related. I don’t want to come off as uptight or controlling, but it’s starting to feel like I’m dating a meme instead of an actual person.

Last night, I finally told her that the Skibidi stuff was getting old and that I’d appreciate it if she could tone it down a bit. She got really quiet and then said she was just having fun and didn’t think it was a big deal. Now she’s upset, and I feel like I might’ve overreacted.

So, AITA for asking her to stop? I don’t want to kill her fun, but I also don’t want to feel like I’m stuck in some weird TikTok trend all the time. Am I being too sensitive, or was I right to say something?",16,1735226117.0,AITAH,24,0.81,False

With the “Ima Nobody” Door opener and a RISK-FREE Proposal (R.F.P.) I am financially indestructible.

I’m like a kid in a candy store with more candy than I can eat in a lifetime.

Here’s the Door Opener (more on the R.F.P. later in this note):

Buy their book, course, software (buy or take a trial) whatever.

If you liked it, drop them a nice note or dm and tell them SPECIFICALLY what you liked and ask if you can write them a review or testimonial. I've never had anyone say ""no""...and rarely do they ""ignore me"".

Write the review/testimonial.

Give it to them.

Let them know you believe in their mission/message so much it needs to spread even more and... Ask them if they'd be open to discussing you helping them sell more of their book, course, and software. You'd do 100% of the work, pay for everything and only get a piece after the money is in their bank account.

In short...

Buy their shit! When you do, you are NO LONGER a NOBODY, but a customer. And DOORS OPEN! You can usually pull this off for 99 cents (for their Kindle book) to a few hundred bucks for a lower-priced course.

This also FORCES you to be intentional about who you want to PARTNER WITH...

Blasting 1001 cold emails using a template works, but dayum...it's a heap of work.

I'd rather be super focused and intentional and buy their shit and see if it's any good first.

It works for me.

I bet it works for you too.

After you get some doors open...

Now you want them to say “YES!” to your proposal.

RFP = Risk-Free Proposal That not only gets them to say “YES!”…

…without references, examples or a reputation.

But with an R.F.P. WE get to make all the rules!

I HATE being told what to do and when to do it!

Most Sinnerz hate taking orders too!

Sinnerz are rebelz who want to call their own shots!

We don’t want BOSSES wagging their fingers and ordering us around!

If you would like to join other sinners then get first 8 pages of [The Truth About Passive Income](https://honeysyed.com/truth) Book for $0.

Take notes and then start feasting on all the candy in the opportunity store.

Most folks make RISKY proposals and they go “hungry”.

People with risky proposals often have skinny kids!

With the “Ima Nobody” Door Opener and the R.F.P. below, you’ll be one IN a million not one OF a million options.

PS In step 5, they may ask, ""How much do you want?""...this is a great lead-in for a discussion. ""It varies depending on the program and what we're doing, if we did it at all...I'd make sure you get the bigger piece of the pie though, would it make sense to have a coffee over Zoom?""",1,1735225918.0,ContentMarketing,0,1.0,False

She has been married 1 time (9months) here in Sweden ended maybe 4 month before we met. The reason I got was something about the fees for mortages that he hadnt told her about.

According to here its alot of cultural differences between a man/woman relation there to here.

Now to us, we been dating and we had some problems with communication (not language) just communication between us about random stuff. Like she were going to buy a cat and I asked her in the car if she had taken out money (was told later that was an unmanly thing and greedy) .

I have bought alot of gifts and flowers.
We have always fun when we are together and our sexlife is amazing for both of us.

I have always picked up the tab for the dinners, Cafe and bar visits. 
Driven around when picking up her daughters from school when needed and I never asked for gas money or anything remotely like that.

When she wanted to go anywhere, we have gone there.

Now to the main things:

She wanted to go to Spain for her daughters birthday for like 10-14 days (not vacation season, and busy time for me at work)
I told here that It would be nice but hard for me to go due to work when we talked about it maybe a month prior to the date of the birthday. She got upset and cut me of and blocked me everywhere.
We got back together maybe two weeks prior ""the date"" talked and I could get 6 days of , now we saw the prices had went way up and the shit had really hit the fan in the region with floodings. I mentioned other places but none was interesting for her.
She got cold from here, didnt wanna talk or meet. 

We met for coffee 3 days before the birthday and I got the feeling everything is better one, I got invited to her daughters birthday and it was nice and normal again.

A couple of days later we met up again and it was colder again and when I dropped her of at her place she was telling me about everything how she thought or cultural was so different and what she expects of a man is far away from my personality, the conversation isnt going anywhere and its like she forces me to agree to that it isnt going to change , my argument of that we have to learn to communicate better was unvalid. So it ends.

10 days later she wants me to pay 2000$ for her dogs examinations and upp to 10k in surgery fees.

I told her that I could help her with a GoFundMe , you broke my heart and expect me to pay?

She told me that that wont save his life. 
A real man would help a desperate woman in need.

So im dead to her now and she told me yesterday when I ran into her that it was the last straw and there is no way back together, so from she loves me to nothing.

Her words ""male friends that I doesnt sleep with helped me with the bills and thought that you are an asshole""

Am I the asshole?

For those of you targeting big law ([explainer](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1enawhl/a_list_of_popular_legal_jobs_for_the_1ls_going_to/) here if you don’t know what that is) for your 1L summer or future 2L summer gig, you’re probably in the heat of it right now. 

You may already be in the process of interviewing, and maybe even passed the screener interview (explainer on that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1gu9vwz/how_to_prepare_for_big_law_screener_interviews_a/) if you don’t know what that is). Congrats! Now time for the next level interview: the callback. 

(At least, assuming you fancy folks don’t already have offers in hand–I know some of you do because the timeline for these things is insane these days)

So let’s talk about callbacks—the longer, more intense sibling of the screener interview. Callbacks are a big deal, and you should be proud you made it this far, but they can also be intimidating if you don’t know what to expect. 

So don’t worry—here’s a breakdown of what a callback is, how to prepare, and how to handle the process so you can hopefully walk out and get that phone call starting with the words “Congrats, we’re excited to offer you a position.”

# First Things First: What Is a Callback?

A callback is essentially a second-round interview for firms, but it’s much more in-depth than the screener and takes much more time.

* **Format:** You’ll typically meet with around 3-6 attorneys total, usually one on one (but in some cases, it can be pairs), including partners and associates, for around 20-30 minutes each. So you should expect usually around 2 (or for some of the intense firms, upwards of 3+ hours of interviewing back to back).
   * Cons to this: it is exceedingly draining for many people. 
   * Pros to this: you get really good at pitching yourself because you just get to practice that interview muscle a ton by default. 
* **Purpose:** These folks are evaluating whether you’d be a good colleague. It’s that classic question of “If I’m stuck at work and there’s a snowstorm outside, would I want to be stuck with you” kind of thing. 
   * Firms use callbacks to assess your skills (at least, ostensibly, because yes, they’re very very green), but most importantly, your personality and overall fit for their specific *firm, office,* and even possibly *practice groups*. 
   * Culture can be wildly different at each firm, at each office, and at each practice group, so this is their chance to see if you fit in, but also your chance to see if you fit in. 
* **More Than Just a Q&A:** These interviews are (ideally) conversational but remember that you want to be strategic. In fact, oftentimes there’s an actual list that interviewers have to fill out after the interview to judge each candidate. There’s a post on that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1fazayu/a_guide_what_interviewers_at_a_firm_judge_a/) actually if you’re curious what they’re looking at.
   * Since every law student is essentially a fresh slate in terms of skills to a firm, as you talk and bring up your work experience/answer questions/weave that into the conversation, you’ll want to specifically emphasize *research, writing,* and *analysis.* 
      * Those are your number 1 value adds as an associate, and you want to show up front that those are skills you either learned in law school (maybe through legal writing, etc), learned through your 1L summer experience, or learned through your prior work experience in a way that makes your prior experience a clear transferable skill set. 

Also, realistically, callbacks are also a chance for the firm to show off a bit. They want to impress you with their culture, work, and people just as much as you want to impress them, so just keep in mind that any answers you get to any questions you might have will probably have a bit of a rose colored tint to them, so take them with a grain of salt. 

# The Timeline

The callback process moves fast, but the exact timing can vary by firm, and even by region (i.e. primary markets like the New York market move super fast, but secondary markets like Atlanta can move slower). 

Here’s what to expect:

1. **After the Screener:**
   * If a firm likes you, you’ll usually hear back within 1-7 days to schedule a callback. Some firms may even contact you the same day if they’re quick to the punch.
2. **After the Callback:**
   * Offers can come as quickly as the same day or take up to a couple of weeks. Firms are often juggling multiple candidates, so don’t panic if it takes a little time.
   * Additionally, if you haven’t heard back in a while, sometimes it might be the case that you are the second string pick and the firm is waiting to hear a response from their first pick. (For example, I had one firm that took nearly 5 weeks to get back to me with an offer, which usually meant their first choice candidate declined the offer, so they were looking at the other candidates that were close calls.) Either way, no need to waste a good worry. Once you complete the callback, focus your attention on the things you can control–your next application or interview, and hope for the best. 

If you want a more detailed timeline of screener-to-callback-to-offer (and how to handle offer extensions if you need to ask for one), there’s[ this timeline guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1ekp3x9/a_timeline_guide_for_firm_jobs_how_long_from/) that might be helpful.

# The Structure of a Callback

Especially if you happen to have some in person, they can take up to the better part of a day once you include commute time, waiting in lobbies, interviewers moving around, and all that jazz. That said, many of these still take place on Zoom which gives you a bit more control and comfort to play the game at least on your home turf.

Here’s what a typical callback day looks like:

1. **Intro with Recruiting:**
   * You’ll often (but not always) start with a quick meeting with the legal recruiting coordinator/HR person. They’ll give you the schedule and answer any logistical questions before the interviews begin.
2. **Attorney Interviews:**
   * You’ll usually meet with attorneys one on one (sometimes in pairs), and there will be around 3-6 attorneys. This will be a mix of associates and partners.
      1. This is purely anecdotal, I did notice that these often started off with more junior folks first and your later interviews were often the more senior folks like partners and Of Counsel. Either way, you’ll usually get a list of who your interviewers are before the big day, so you can do your research and see who you’re talking to. 
   * **The tone can vary:** Some interviews are casual and conversational and sometimes barely talking about school or work experience, while others might feel more formal with canned questions like “tell me about a time you XYZ”
      1. **Sometimes you’ll get a bad interviewer. That’s okay. Don’t freak out. It happens:** Every blue moon you might get an interviewer who is either too tired/too busy/or got pulled in last minute to do the interview. Sometimes, that person will have literally zero questions for you and basically start off the interview by just asking “what can I tell you about the firm?” 
      2. (Personally these are a big turn off for me for a firm since as an interviewer, I’m also judging culture fit, but it happens). 
      3. Don’t worry though. Just make sure you have questions lined up and gear up to take a driver's seat for the conversation. If you need a couple go to questions that show that you did your homework on the firm, there’s a post about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1fazahq/questions_to_ask_in_an_ociscreenercallback/). 
   * **Topics:** Generally, you’ll discuss your background, interest in the firm (*definitely* make sure you have a “Why this firm” answer ready to go in your back pocket, and possibly answer a couple of behavioral questions (e.g., “Tell me about a time you overcame a challenge”). But more often than not, I find most folks will briefly scan your resume, look for something that pops out, and just start asking some genuine questions about that (or just start asking you questions after you answer the standard “tell me about yourself” question). 
   * For example, maybe you had an interesting first career before you lateraled to law, or maybe you’re super involved with some clubs, or whatever. 
3. **Lunch or Coffee (Optional):**
   * Some firms, if they’re doing an in person interview, can include a meal or coffee chat with junior associates after the interviews. 
   * Remember, though this is more relaxed than an interview, it’s still part of the evaluation—stay professional, engaged, ask questions. (I promise you, every single year there is some story about a kid who decided that this was the time to order hard liquor at lunch or something silly and it never ends well, so just make sure you still treat it like an interview/evaluation until you’re out the door and on your way home.)

# How to Prepare

1. **Research the Firm:**
   * **Do your first level google/deep dive into the firm’s website.** Brownie points if you happen to catch any positive recent news/major cases/deals and weave them naturally into the conversation, i.e. “I’m interested in X practice area and I am really intrigued by the firm's publication/latest case on X that I just read about.” 
      1. You don’t need to be an expert or spend a ton of time on this, but it’s always a good idea to show you know about their world and can speak competently about it generally, even without being an expert or attorney yet. 
   * **Key research point:** Know their practice areas. We’ve seen a lot of folks go into an interview, who are wonderful and well spoken candidates, but who clearly didn’t do any research and say something like “I’m interested in X practice” and then the attorney has to awkwardly say “Welp. We don’t have X practice. Sooooo…” It’s awkward and a pretty easy way to turn a candidacy into an immediate no, so just make sure you know what the firm does, and you don’t say something else. (This is all listed on the firm websites or you can see practice area rankings on [Chambers](https://chambers.com/))
2. **Practice Your Answers:**
   * As I mentioned above, be ready to discuss your resume, why you’re interested in the firm, and “tell me about yourself.” Those are by far the most common questions you’ll be asked first, so you’ll want tight and focused answers for each. 
      1. I recommend checking out something like the [STAR method](https://www.themuse.com/advice/star-interview-method), that just helps you focus your answers and tidy them up with nice clean endings (if you’re like me and long winded, I find this helps give them structure so you don’t ramble in interviews).
   * Think about behavioral questions you might be asked (e.g., about teamwork, problem-solving when there was no answer, etc.) and prepare concise answers. 
      1. If you need a callback interview prep document with a list of the most common big law interview questions, I’ve made one that I’m happy to share. Feel free to DM if you want it. 
   * Lastly, of course, take a second to practice a couple answers and cover a couple bullet points with yourself or a friend, but no need to overrehearse either. The more canned your answers sound, the less conversational the flow of the interview will be. 
      1. My personal trick to this is that I will bullet point a couple of key stories in my notes and key points in those stories I might want to hit if I end up bringing them up, but I won’t write out word for word what I want to say. That way, it gives me a little breathing room to talk about the story in a natural way, as opposed to feeling like I should read directly off my notes. 
3. **Prepare Questions:**
   * This is not just a chance for you to vet the firm, but remember, your questions are still a chance to show something of value—that you’ve done your homework and are (ostensibly) genuinely interested in the people and culture of the firm. 
   * Again, here’s a [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1fazahq/questions_to_ask_in_an_ociscreenercallback/) with a couple questions that show you did your homework and aren’t treating this interview as 1 of 1000 similar interviews (even though it might very well be).

# After the Callback

1. **Send Thank-You Emails:**
   * It’s debatable how much these actually will sway anyone's opinion ultimately, but I’m personally of the school that it never hurts, so give it a shot. They don’t have to be long, and—pro tip: if you jot down a brief note after/during the interview about something you talked about, you’ll be able to more easily write a bit of a personalized thank-you email to each attorney you met.
   * For example, you can simply say “Hello XYZ, Thank you so much for your time in the interview today. Our conversation about X really helped me evaluate the firm/my practice areas of interest/my career/whatever. I am grateful for all your time and insight. I look forward to hearing from the team. Best, XYZ”
   * Bam. Short, professional, personal, and gives you one more positive touch point opportunity with that interviewer. 
2. **Be Patient:**
   * Waiting for an offer can be nerve-wracking and really it should be considered a 10th circle of hell, but just try to remember that firms are juggling a lot of candidates. If it’s been more than two weeks, it’s okay to politely follow up with the recruiter. 
   * Pro tip: If there are any updates to your application, that is an easy way to wiggle in a follow up poke too. You can simply say “Hi Recruiter X, I have XYZ update to my application (i.e. maybe new grades, resume updates, whatever). Let me know how the application process is going and if there is anything else I can provide the team. Thank you.”
3. **Compare Offers**:
   * I’m going to manifest here and say you’re all going to get multiple offers, okay? In that case, here’s a [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1eb23o3/a_guide_on_how_to_compare_offers_from_firms_after/) that can help you weigh your options, compare between offers, and get really in the weeds on how to tell these firms apart. 

# That’s all for now!

Callbacks are intense, but they’re also the last big hurdle to the offer and a chance for you to learn about the firm through multiple long conversations with their attorneys (hopefully your future co-workers). 

Even if you don’t get the job, treat every callback as a learning experience with a mini-mental list of what went well and what you could improve on. You’re going to have so many interviews in the next year (and even in your career generally), that it’s just like going to the gym. More reps makes you stronger, faster, and cleaner. You’ll nail it.

As always, feel free to DM if you have questions about big law, the interviewing process, or law school recruiting generally.

Boxing Day isn’t just the day after Christmas—it’s the ultimate treasure hunt of deals, steals, and post-holiday glory. Whether you’re braving the crowds or sniping deals online, these 10 hacks will help you conquer Boxing Day like a seasoned pro. Let the games begin!

# 1. Plan Your Attack

Don’t just wing it. Make a list of what you actually need (or *want*) and know which stores have the best deals. This isn’t just shopping—it’s tactical warfare, and you’re the general.

# 2. Early Bird Gets the Bargains

Set your alarm, chug that coffee, and hit the ground running. The best deals don’t wait for sleepyheads, so don’t snooze and lose!

# 3. Go Digital First

Before braving the malls, check online. Many retailers drop exclusive online sales at midnight, meaning you can snag deals while lounging in your PJs. Winning.

# 4. Stack Discounts Like a Boss

Coupons, cashback apps, and store rewards? Use them all. Boxing Day is the perfect time to double (or triple!) dip on savings. Who doesn’t love a good stack?

# 5. Prioritize Big-Ticket Items

Need a new TV, laptop, or kitchen gadget? Boxing Day is *the* time to buy. These are the items with the steepest discounts, so focus your energy where it counts.

# 6. Shop Smart for Next Christmas

Stock up on discounted holiday wrapping paper, decorations, and gift sets. Future you will thank present you for thinking ahead (and saving a ton of money).

# 7. Know the Return Policies

Let’s face it—sometimes we get caught up in the frenzy and end up with… questionable purchases. Check return policies before buying, just in case.

# 8. Bring Your Game Face to the Stores

If you’re heading out, channel your inner athlete. Comfy shoes, a bottle of water, and snacks are essential for surviving the battlefield that is the post-holiday shopping crowd.

# 9. Team Up for Maximum Coverage

Grab a buddy (or two) and divide and conquer. One person hits electronics, another tackles clothing, and you meet up to share your loot. Teamwork makes the dream work.

# 10. Don’t Forget Self-Care

Boxing Day isn’t *just* about shopping. Take advantage of spa discounts, gym memberships, or even a cozy day in with discounted movies and snacks. Pamper yourself—you’ve earned it.

Boxing Day is more than a sale; it’s an adventure. With these hacks, you’ll be the undisputed champion of deals, and your wallet will come out smiling.

So we went full carnivore about 2 and a half weeks ago; only eating beef, lamb, chicken & eggs, and a little bit of cheese. Butter or ghee and salt. We’re probably still detoxing from 50 odd years of sugar/carbs/junk consumption and the odd craving hits hard, especially in the evening. Meals during the day are challenging for me as I spend a lot of time on the road.

Plus side of our journey is that I’m feeling great, drinking loads of water (and sparkling water) and one or two coffees with a dollop of cream (no sugar).  My backache is gone (doesn’t take me 10 minutes to stand up straight in the morning), I have more energy and smoking less. My wife has similar improvements, her gut is working more regularly, she sleeps better (after going cold turkey from a 12 year sleeping tab habit about 3 months ago), her skin is looking better. So lots of plusses happening.

The challenge is making meals, everything seems and tastes bland.  Kids aren’t exactly enjoying the meals even though we all love meat. Is there a resource for carnivore recipes? What “seasoning”/herbs/spices can be used without compromising the process? 

We South Africans are fairly addicted to braais (a materially better version of BBQ); but I’ll be honest I’m getting a bit annoyed with having to braai every second day. What can be made in the oven? On the stove? Mince meat (ground beef) comes out super bland.

Noisy rooms and places are exhausting and I have a very difficult time focusing on hearing in party or group scenarios, so I give up and just nod. I cling to my hubby and beg him not to leave my side unless I find someone I know well.

Small talk is like nails on a chalkboard.

I often cannot get words out to speak what is in my head so my spoken sentences are choppy.

I annoy people by giving background to a story or a reason for a decision or belief.

The opposite of hoarding, I don't like 'stuff', clutter or knick-knacks. Everything in it's proper place. If I can't see it, it doesn't exist so why keep it?

Unless I'm leading an online group study I find it difficult to share my opinion or speak up for myself.

I often feel misunderstood, unnecessary, and inadequate, invisible, and unknown.

Prior to retirement I held a highly visible position in a very large company, had many acquaintances (few real friends), juggled more major projects than humanly possible always creating more and more to prove my worth.

Looking back, I wonder if the burn out was due to heavy masking, because I actually loved what I did but never felt valued.

Hubby & I are empty-nesters with 2 grown daughters, one is a school psych and has been diagnosed with ADHD.

I do have a small group of friends (4 of us) who chat constantly via text. 

Sorry for this long jumbled post (and probably lots of errors). But, this is the first time I have ever felt comfortable enough to be vulnerable and share what I have.

If you've read this far, thank you.

1hmq2y8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hmq2y8,Narcissistic/lying/delusional FIL,"This man is possibly my most hated person.

He was horrible to my husband growing up, furthest thing from a father you could ever imagine.  This man represents everything my husband wanted to never be as a father. 

This man lies about literally EVERYTHING. We had years and years of not liking each other. But this time when he came for my husbands Masters graduation, I lost my mother fucking mind. 

I’ll start with the beginning of this most recent trip.  My husband’s graduation was December 13th.  

(Backstory, we bought a new house and moved in November 25, still in the process of getting settled, we are converting an office into a bedroom for my older daughter who is currently living with her Father)

He flew in Tuesday, the 10th, could not give us any info of when his plane would arrive. Trying to get all this shit done.  He finally arrives.  I tell him that he can NOT sleep in the office as we are converting for my older daughter who hasn’t even got to sleep in there.

Day 2(Wednesday the 11th)

He leaves that evening and tells us he will be staying with one of my husbands siblings.  I wake up at 5:00am to get my kids ready for school and this asshole is in his underwear doing push up in my daughters room/office where I told him he could NOT sleep. 

Instead of him waiting on my Husband to wake up he asks if he can ride with me to take my kids to school.  (This is litterally their 6th day of their new school, we are trying to figure out our flow, best way/time to get to school.). I oblige and say yes,  then he proceeds to say, “can we stop and get them coffee?”  I say no, I run a tight ship(routine driven) day.  He continues to tell my children that he wanted to get them a coffee treat, but their mom said no. 

Literally fuck this man, my kids do not have any issues with this, we’re not stopping and getting Starbucks on the daily. Get the kids dropped off and  then he proceeds to ask if I want to get a coffee with him, no absolutely not, I have so much shit to do before my husbands graduation, and still move shit from our old house. (Also, the last thing I want to do is hang out with this idiot. 

Day 3(Thursday the 12th)

Wednesday night he ask if him and my husband could go Christmas shopping for the girls.  I say, “well I need to go to, because I’m not done.”  He is clearly upset with this, I don’t care. Thursday we go to Sam’s club, my youngest daughter is into legos he picks up three sets for her ($15 each) I say it would be best just to get one so she doesn’t get overwhelmed, he doesn’t listen and gets two.   Whatever, I’ll monitor Lego consumption(let it go) our middle daughter is a hello kitty collector,  we frequent Sam’s club so she has most of the things there. I grab a pillow that she’s wanted  forever.  He tries to grab another pillow I point out other options she doesn’t have since I AM getting the pillow. He starts picking things up and being like “oh, ugh, can I put this in the cart.”  Continues to take it in and out just being an asshole and keeps repeating, “are you sure?”  He’s Literally doing this just to fuck with me.  We then go to kohls where I encourage him to please spend an equal amount on our kids.  (Last time he was here and bringing gifts to our middle daughter and being like, “dont tell your sister”, while her sister is 5 feet away.  So, so this isn’t a new thing.  He continues shopping at kohls spends another $100 on middle daughter and nothing on youngest.  Super infuriating. 

Day 4( Friday the 13th) GRADUATION DAY

This is going to be a hectic day, I get everyone woke up early enough so we can stop and get this Goddamn Starbucks. (My kids, don’t even drink it, gets left in my car and drinks spill) cool. 

Hectic day continues. My husband and I have to leave early for graduation, as we are stressed and walking to the door I see all of my laundry that was in the dryer now on top of it in a WET paint tray. 

I LOSE MY GODDAMN MIND,  everyone who knows me knows do not fuck with my laundry situation. I start screaming about who did this his dad walks in and blames it on my youngest daughter who has NEVER even used a dryer before.  This man threw his own granddaughter right under the bus.

We have a back and forth exchange I tell him that he  needed to be a grown up and ask an adult instead of doing that to a kid.  He makes a whole bunch of stupid sounds a young middle school boy would make trying to fight with a girl.  I then get in this man’s face my finger, and say, “don’t fucking talk to me”. 

My husband lets out a plead to please stop, so I do, but he knew the moment he saw what was happening(laundry) this was a losing battle.

My husband and I leave to head to graduation, I pull it together(As best, I can).  He graduates, with honors, he’s worked so hard and I know I’ve had a hand in ruining.  I don’t have many regrets, but that’s definitely one. 

Day 5 (Saturday the 14)

This man calls into his job( he lives in California) pretends to have Covid so he can extend his trip.  In all honesty this man came out here with no return ticket hoping his kids would buy him one. What the actual fuck. 

Later that night we do dinner and my middle daughter is upset and chooses not to go, while we are at dinner he’s talking about how he’s going to come pick her up and take her to McDonald’s.   “No, absolutely not, she chose not to come, there is food at home.” 

Day 6(Sunday the 15)

We go fishing, this man gets a text that says, “mask up, see you on Monday”


Hahaha Karmas a bitch, he didn’t make it on Monday. 


Finally leaves on Tuesday the 16th, good fucking riddance.  


My husband calls to thank him for the presents for the kids, one kid got $200 spent on them, the other $20.

Anyway the conversation progress and my husband tells his father I’m asleep, FIL continues on about how we seem to be having marriage problems. This is default go to.  I could see that it would appear that way because FIL makes me want to jump off a bridge.  But my husband and I are truly in love, we are best friends.  And my husband’s response was something to the effect of, “ it works for us” definitely not defending me in my mind.  


Anyway so that brings me here to bitch instead of writing this stupid asshole a mean letter.  Or taking to my petty ways and finding a way to make him lose his job. 


Attached are some cute photos of me and my husband. ",4,1735225381.0,inlaws,1,1.0,False

My dog is anxious — barks nonstop in unfamiliar situations, when alone in a room, and his hind legs shake both when stimulated and when he sleeps. 

For years our vet said he was just anxious, but now our new vet wants him to see a neurologist. He will see a neurologist in a couple weeks.

Our new vet prescribed him gabapentin and trazadone to be used 2-3 hours before stressful situations. Since we were going to my mom’s for Christmas, he took the medication. I had low expectations because he’s taken Trazadone before, but it always made him seem like he was just sedated.

But! What. A. Difference. With gabapentin and trazadone, he is functional but calm. His legs haven’t shaken! He is sleepy too, but when he’s awake and alert, he is calm. Normally I can anticipate his needs (he nibbles when he wants to be pet; barks when he wants to eat or poop; states and shakes when he sees me get up to do anything). But yesterday, he was CALM. He didn’t follow me everywhere. He napped on his own — without needing or really wanting me nearby. He let me wake up and drink coffee before I let him outside. He was like a new dog.

Is this a common combination of medication, and do dogs use this daily? Of course I’ll ask my vet if this is something he should be taking daily — but curious what others have experienced.

I’m sad it took us 6 years to experience this, but I feel like this has the potential to change our lives.

1hmq0e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hmq0e9/another_fucking_earth/,Another Fucking Earth?,"""Another fucking Earth?,"" muttered Weiss, tossing a cold cup of instant coffee into the trash. “It’s a goddamn mirror. Same plate tectonics, same atmospheric composition. Hell, same anthropogenic carbon spikes in their goddamn atmosphere. Somebody tell me I’m hallucinating.”

The planet loomed in the digital vista of the observatory’s enhanced visualization array, an uncanny mirror of Earth suspended in a sea of infinite black. Its oceans reflected the same hues of blue-green serenity, its continents arranged with a haunting familiarity, and even the faint artificial glow of cityscapes adorned its nightside.

At the helm of the observatory, Dr. Amara Weiss leaned into her console, her eyes bloodshot from weeks of ceaseless work. Around her, the control room hummed with quiet chaos, the low thrum of servers mingling with the clipped voices of her team. Data scrolled across the screens faster than the human eye could process, and overhead, a looping AI voice quietly reminded: “Priority Transmission: Sol Command requesting confirmation of all observations.”

Behind her, Ravi Patel, the team’s astrophysicist, scoffed. “If this is a hallucination, Amara, it’s a group fucking one. Every spectrum check aligns. The planet even spins at 23.9 hours.”

“And the radio signals,” chimed in Valeriya Sokolova, their cryptography expert. “We’ve isolated their broadcast band—FM and AM primarily. It’s like listening to a goddamn time capsule.” She gestured to the speakers, where faint echoes of static-laden music drifted through: 90s pop, talk radio, even a garbled advertisement for something called ‘Schmidt’s SuperMart.’

Weiss stared at the projected image of the planet, her lips curling into a bitter smirk. “They’re us, aren’t they? Or something damn close. Late 21st century, on the cusp of self-destruction or salvation. And we’re just sitting here, like voyeurs, watching their history play out.”





The revelation had escalated to the highest echelons of humanity’s fragile governance. What had begun as a curiosity in the orbital observatories of Earth’s L5 station quickly spiraled into an existential debate. The United Nations Coalition for Space Exploration (UNCSE), long fractured by post-resource-collapse geopolitics, found itself thrust into reluctant unity.

In the sterile command room of the UNS Celestial Vanguard, Captain Malik Adebayo stood amidst his bridge officers, their faces grim with the weight of the mission. The ship was an Ark-class exploration vessel, bristling with every piece of diplomatic and defensive technology humanity could scrape together.

""Let’s be clear,"" Malik began, his voice razor-sharp, ""this isn’t some Star Trek kumbaya shit. The odds of this going sideways are off the fucking charts. We are not gods, not saviors. We are diplomats—begrudgingly. And if this goes bad, we’ve got protocols to make sure we come out of it alive.""

Commander Lin Tao snorted from her seat. “Relax, Captain. Worst case, they think we’re aliens and throw rocks at us. Best case, we show them what a quantum comm system looks like, and they think we’re gods.”

“Don’t make me regret bringing you, Lin,” Malik growled, though his tone carried a trace of amusement.

The briefing continued, heavy on technical jargon: phased-array communication lasers, quantum-encrypted message packets, and contingencies for cultural contamination. Each officer took their turn presenting—linguistics experts, cultural historians, even a goddamn PR officer from the Earth Alliance Media Directorate, who insisted humanity’s image be preserved “for posterity.”





The first attempt at communication was simple: a radio transmission on their FM band.

“This is Captain Malik Adebayo of the UNS Celestial Vanguard. We come in peace. We are explorers from the Sol System, seeking knowledge and understanding.” The translation AI rendered his words into half a dozen Earth languages, cycling through Mandarin, English, Hindi, and more.

For hours, nothing but static. Then, a burst of sound—a response.

“... bullshit prank ... FCC violation ... whoever’s broadcasting this, cut it out before we trace you...”

Malik pinched the bridge of his nose. “Great. They think we’re a bunch of assholes with a ham radio. Lin, send the video transmission.”

The bridge crew tensed as the feed went live: a holographic image of Malik in full uniform, standing before the UNS insignia, his face calm but commanding.

“People of... the other Earth,” he began, the words feeling surreal even as he spoke them, “this is not a prank. We are not from your world but from one very much like it. We are here to learn, to understand. Please, respond.”

The screen flickered. Then came the face of a man in a rumpled shirt, his eyes sunken and skeptical. Behind him, the banner of a TV studio.

“This is WZRD-13 News, Milwaukee,” the man said, half-laughing. “Uh... who the hell are you guys, and why do you look like an Amazon Prime sci-fi series?”

“He’s taking the piss,” Lin muttered, earning a snort from the comms officer.

“Stay professional,” Malik hissed. He adjusted his tone, his practiced diplomacy kicking in. “Mister, I assure you this is no fiction. We are representatives of the United Nations Coalition for Space Exploration, based on a parallel version of your Earth. Our mission is one of peace and discovery.”

The figure in the feed blinked, his skeptical expression shifting to something between confusion and curiosity. “Parallel Earth? So, like... some multiverse shit? Did Elon Musk cook this up before he disappeared in ’45?”

Malik’s lips twitched in irritation. “We’re more than willing to provide proof. Perhaps your government would prefer to handle these discussions?”

The man chuckled nervously, rubbing the back of his neck. “Yeah, good luck with that. Our government’s been a shitshow since the Resource Wars. Best you’ll get is some bureaucrat from the Unified Earth Council trying to spin this for votes.”

“Resource Wars?” Lin whispered to Malik, her brow furrowing. He filed it away for later.

The anchor leaned forward, his tone shifting. “Alright, let’s say I believe you. What do you guys want? Why risk blowing our collective minds with... whatever this is?”

Malik hesitated. It was a fair question—one he’d been asking himself since the mission began. He straightened, his voice firm. “We believe our worlds have much to learn from one another. Your history mirrors our own in many ways, and understanding those parallels could benefit both our civilizations.”

He raised an eyebrow. “And what’s the catch?”

“No catch,” Malik said. “But cooperation requires trust. And trust starts with communication.”

The journalist’s skeptical facade cracked just slightly. “Okay. I’ll bite. But if you guys turn out to be some kind of alien overlords, don’t say I didn’t warn everyone.” He smirked. “You’ve got my number. Good luck convincing the rest of the planet.”

Before Malik could respond, Lin Tao, monitoring the secondary channels, perked up. “Sir, we’ve got chatter. Their military is picking this up. Looks like NORAD has intercepted the signal.”

“Perfect,” Malik muttered, his patience thinning. He signaled Lin to mute their feed temporarily. “Keep this guy on the line for now, but prepare a more formal message for the brass. If they’re as trigger-happy as we were in the 21st century, we need to tread carefully.”

Lin grinned. “Oh, come on. Where’s your sense of adventure, Captain? A little chaos makes things interesting.”

Malik shot her a glare. “Not when nukes are on the table.”





The hours that followed were a shitstorm of mistrust, wonder, and cultural whiplash. Governments scrambled to classify the discovery. Religious leaders proclaimed it a miracle or a heresy. Social media platforms on both planets exploded into chaos, conspiracy theories running rampant.

On the UNS Celestial Vanguard, Malik watched as the chaos unfolded through intercepted broadcasts and hacked data streams.

“Jesus,” muttered Lin, scrolling through a mirrored Earth’s version of Twitter. “#FakeAliens is trending. So is #SecondEarthHoax. These idiots think it’s some elaborate PR stunt.”

Barely fifteen minutes later, the UNS Celestial Vanguard detected a new transmission, this time originating from a hardened military uplink. The message was brief, terse, and to the point:

“This is General Alicia Perez, United States Strategic Command. Identify yourself, your location, and your intentions immediately, or we will consider this a hostile incursion.”

“Shit,” Lin said under her breath, glancing at Malik. “They’re not screwing around.”

Malik nodded grimly. “Alright, patch me through. Full diplomatic mode.”

When the link stabilized, the face of General Perez filled the monitor. She was a woman of indeterminate age, her expression carved from stone, her uniform immaculate. Behind her, a war room buzzed with activity, figures moving like shadows across rows of monitors.

“General Perez,” Malik began, his tone measured. “I’m Captain Malik Adebayo of the UNS Celestial Vanguard. We are an exploratory vessel from a parallel Earth. Our mission is peaceful—we seek knowledge, not conflict.”

Perez’s eyes narrowed. “Parallel Earth. That’s a hell of a claim, Captain. You’ve got about thirty seconds to convince me you’re not some advanced adversary testing our defenses.”

Malik resisted the urge to roll his eyes. “Our origins can be verified. We’ve transmitted data packets containing quantum-stabilized isotopic signatures unique to our universe. I suggest your physicists review them before you start aiming missiles at the sky.”

Perez glanced off-screen, likely consulting her advisors. When she looked back, her expression had softened, but only slightly. “Alright, Captain. Suppose I buy your story. What’s your endgame here?”

“To establish dialogue,” Malik replied. “We’ve been observing your world for some time. The similarities to our own history are... remarkable. We hoped we might exchange knowledge, perhaps offer insights into avoiding some of the mistakes we made.”

Perez raised an eyebrow. “Observing, huh? Sounds a lot like spying.”

Lin Tao, unable to resist, whispered, “This is going well.”

“Quiet,” Malik hissed before addressing Perez again. “If it’s spying, it’s the most transparent kind you’ll ever encounter. We’ve taken great care not to interfere. This conversation is our first direct contact.”

As the minutes stretched into many more hours, the situation grew increasingly tense. Other nations began to chime in, their military and scientific communities scrambling to analyze the unprecedented contact. The Russians demanded proof, the Chinese insisted on joint control of the dialogue, and smaller nations clamored for assurances that this wasn’t some elaborate hoax or precursor to an invasion.

Onboard the Celestial Vanguard, the atmosphere was no less strained. Malik paced the bridge, occasionally stopping to review reports or issue orders. Lin sat at her station, scrolling through intercepted broadcasts with a bemused expression.

“Looks like the conspiracy theorists are having a field day,” she said. “Half the planet thinks we’re fake. The other half thinks we’re here to steal their water or probe their cows.”

“Charming,” Malik muttered. “Any actual progress?”

“Sort of. The Canadians want to talk. They’re suggesting a joint scientific summit—neutral ground, open dialogue. But good luck getting the big players to agree.”

Before Malik could respond, a junior officer called out, “Captain, we’re detecting an energy surge from the planet. It’s localized... military installation. Looks like they’re powering up a directed-energy weapon.”

Malik’s stomach dropped. “Shields up. I want full evasive readiness. And patch me back to General Perez.”

The monitor flickered to life, and Perez’s face appeared once more. Her expression was colder than before, her jaw set like granite.

“Captain,” she began, her voice sharp, “you’ve got one last chance to prove your peaceful intentions. Otherwise, we’re prepared to defend our planet.”

Malik clenched his fists, his mind racing. “General, if you fire on us, you’ll confirm every fear we had about this mission. We are not your enemies. But if you force our hand, we will defend ourselves.”

Perez stared him down, her silence heavy with calculation. Finally, she spoke. “Then prove it. Stand down and let us verify your claims.”

Malik sighed, glancing at Lin. “Power down non-essential systems. Let them scan us.”

Lin hesitated but nodded, her fingers flying across the console. “Done. Hope they don’t take this as an invitation to shoot us out of the sky.”





The next few hours were a tense waiting game, every passing moment thick with the possibility of escalation. When the scans concluded, Perez’s tone was marginally less hostile.

“Alright, Captain. Your ship checks out. For now, we’ll agree to a ceasefire. But don’t mistake this for trust. One wrong move, and you’re scrap metal.”

Malik exhaled, a small victory but a victory nonetheless. “Understood, General. Let’s see if we can make this a conversation worth having.”

The bridge crew erupted into cautious cheers as the tension eased, but Malik knew better than to celebrate. The road ahead would be long, fraught with distrust and potential disaster. Still, for the first time in days, he allowed himself a flicker of hope.

“Let’s hope they’re more like us in the ways that count,” he murmured to himself, staring at the planet below.

The UNS Celestial Vanguard hung in high orbit over Mirror Earth like a silent sentinel, its reflective hull glinting under the distant sun. Inside, the tension had not eased. Even as the ceasefire held, the crew knew the slightest misstep could reignite hostilities.

Captain Malik Adebayo leaned against the edge of the holographic tactical table, his eyes scanning the projected layout of Mirror Earth's atmosphere. Red lines and blinking markers denoted restricted military zones, while blue arcs represented projected safe corridors for descent.

Lin Tao, standing beside him, broke the silence. “So, we’re really doing this? We’re sending a shuttle into that hornet’s nest?”

Malik straightened, fixing her with a tired but resolute look. “We have to. If we don’t make a move, they’ll think we’re hiding something—or worse, planning an attack.”

She sighed, flipping through data on her wrist interface. “Alright, but let’s make this clear: if they shoot us down, I’m holding you personally responsible for the waste of my vacation time.”

“Duly noted,” Malik deadpanned. He turned to the rest of the bridge. “Alright, team. We need a small, agile vessel for this mission. Something fast, with minimal crew and maximum defenses.”

Lieutenant Ekon Ogundele, the ship’s grizzled flight operations officer, grunted from his station. “We’ve got the Vanguard’s Arrow. Quick little bastard. She’s built for atmospheric entry, reinforced hull, and good maneuverability. She’s also armed, just in case.”

Malik’s brow furrowed. “We want to avoid anything that screams ‘military.’ Strip her of non-essential weapons, and make sure the transponders are set to broadcast a peaceful mission signature.”

Ogundele snorted. “Aye, sir. But if this goes south, you’ll wish we had a few missiles in the tubes.”

By the time the Vanguard’s Arrow was prepped for launch, the crew roster had been finalized. Malik himself would lead the mission—protocol be damned. If this operation was going to be the linchpin for peaceful relations, he wanted to be there to see it through.

Joining him were Lin Tao, the ship’s most experienced communications officer, and Dr. Nadia Rassul, an anthropologist specializing in human evolutionary parallels.

“Great,” Lin said as she settled into her seat. “So, the three of us are the guinea pigs. At least if we die, we’ll do it spectacularly.”

“Spirited as ever,” Malik muttered, running a final diagnostic on the console. “Remember, this isn’t just a touchdown. This is history in the making.”

Dr. Rassul, seated behind them, adjusted the straps of her harness. “History has a funny way of remembering people who screw up first contact. Let’s not add our names to that list.”





The airlock sealed behind them with a hiss, and the Arrow detached from the Celestial Vanguard. The sudden weightlessness of orbit enveloped them briefly before the thrusters engaged, propelling them toward the blue-and-green expanse of Mirror Earth below.

As the Arrow cut through the planet’s upper atmosphere, the crew was silent, focused on the instruments and the external view. The craft’s heat shields glowed orange, the temperature spiking as they breached the thermosphere.

“This is the easy part,” Lin quipped, her hands flying over the controls. “It’s the landing and not getting shot at that worries me.”

“Keep your focus, Lin,” Malik said, his tone sharp but not unkind. “We’re threading a needle here. I want this to be as smooth as possible.”

Ahead, a designated landing zone came into view—a barren stretch of desert miles away from any populated areas. It had been chosen after tense negotiations with General Perez and her counterparts, a neutral site where they could establish a temporary foothold.

Ogundele’s voice crackled over the comms. “Arrow, this is Vanguard. You’re clear for descent. Keep it clean, Captain.”

Malik smirked despite the tension. “We’ll do our best, Ekon. See you on the other side.”

As the Vanguard's Arrow burned through the lower stratosphere, the instruments began to scream warnings. The targeting radar blinked to life, its tone an insistent, high-pitched wail. Lin Tao’s hands flew across her console, silencing the alarms with practiced efficiency.

""Got something on our six,"" Lin muttered, her eyes narrowing as she scanned the incoming data. ""Multiple somethings, actually. Looks like… Oh, you’ve gotta be kidding me. Captain, we’ve got bogeys. Primitive jets, but they’re packing heat.""

Malik’s jaw tightened as he leaned over her shoulder. The external cameras painted the picture clearly: a squadron of sleek, gray fighter jets streaking through the atmosphere, their afterburners glowing like angry eyes. Their weapon systems were hot, targeting the Arrow with an unnerving precision that belied their antiquated designs.

""Type?"" he asked tersely.

""F-35s or something close. Late 21st-century models,"" Lin replied. ""Subsonic in the thicker air, but they’re armed to the teeth. Looks like missiles, some old-school cannons. Nothing we can't outpace—""

""But outpacing isn’t the mission,"" Malik cut in. ""They’re here to escort—or test us.""

Dr. Rassul, strapped into her seat behind them, leaned forward. ""You mean they're poking the bear to see if it bites?""

""Exactly,"" Malik said grimly. ""And biting back isn't an option.""

The fighters closed in, moving into classic V-shaped formations on either side of the Arrow. Their cockpits were visible now, and Malik could make out the silhouettes of their pilots. Humans.

""Comm systems are lighting up,"" Lin said, patching the signals through. The bridge filled with static before a sharp voice cut through.

""Unidentified craft, this is Captain Marcus Steele of the United States Armed Forces. You are entering restricted airspace. Reduce your speed immediately and comply with the designated escort formation. Failure to comply will result in engagement."" 

Malik took a steadying breath and activated the comms. ""Captain Steele, this is Malik Adebayo, commanding the UNS Vanguard's Arrow. We’re here on a diplomatic mission under your own ceasefire terms. Let’s not escalate this.""

There was a long pause, during which the fighter jets tightened their formation. Steele’s voice returned, cold and sharp. ""A diplomatic mission doesn’t involve flying a stealth craft unannounced into sovereign airspace. Follow the escort pattern or face consequences.""

""Hostile lot, aren’t they?"" Lin murmured, eyes flicking between their altitude and the escort planes. ""What’s the play, Captain?""

""We follow. No sudden moves. Let them play alpha dog for now,"" Malik said. ""But keep the shields ready. If this turns into a shooting match, we survive first, diplomacy second.""

The Arrow slowed, falling into formation with the jets as they guided it toward the barren landing zone. The desert below stretched endlessly, its sands shimmering under the midday sun. From the external cameras, the Arrow’s reflective hull stood in stark contrast to the dull, painted steel of the jets escorting it.

In the cockpit of one of the fighters, Captain Steele eyed the alien craft through his HUD. The thing looked more like a silver dart than a spaceship, with its seamless surface and faint blue glow at the seams. It wasn’t armed—or at least, not visibly—but Steele didn’t trust anything about it.

""Visuals don’t match anything in the database,"" Steele muttered into his comm. ""Closest analog is one of our own experimental designs, but this thing’s at least sixty fucking years ahead of us. Overwatch, do you copy?""

""Copy, Steele,"" came the voice of a ground controller. ""Maintain escort and prepare for contingency plans. We’ve got SAMs on standby if they break formation.""

As the formation descended below 10,000 feet, one of the jets on the Arrow’s starboard side veered slightly out of position. Malik noticed the shift immediately.

“Lin?” he asked, keeping his voice steady.

“Yeah, I see it,” she said, her tone growing tense. “He’s… locking on.”

“Locking—what?!” Dr. Rassul nearly bolted upright, her face pale. “I thought this was an escort!”

“It is,” Malik said grimly. “Until they decide they’re done playing nice. Lin, shields to maximum. Don’t give them a reason to think we’re hitting back.”

The lock-on warning blared again, and moments later, the rogue fighter fired a missile. It streaked toward the Arrow, leaving a contrail of white smoke in its wake.

“Brace!” Malik shouted.

The missile slammed into the Arrow’s energy shield, detonating in a fiery blossom that rocked the ship but left its hull unscathed. The fighters scattered momentarily, caught off-guard by the sheer power of the defense system.

“Steele!” Malik barked into the comm. “Tell your people to stand down! We’re not here to fight, but if you push us—”

The fighter’s comms came alive with overlapping voices. “What the hell was that?” one pilot yelled. “It just ate a direct hit!”

“Hold fire! I repeat, HOLD FIRE!” Steele’s voice cut through the chaos. “Stand down, all units. This is an escort mission, not a firing range.”

The Arrow touched down moments later, its struts sinking slightly into the sand. The escort fighters peeled away, circling like hawks overhead. On the ground, military convoys and personnel awaited, their weapons trained on the ship.

Malik exhaled as the engines powered down. ""Well, that could’ve gone worse.""

“Could’ve gone better, too,” Lin shot back. “Next time, how about we skip the missile test?”

Dr. Rassul shook her head. “This isn’t diplomacy. This is a standoff with words.”

“Then let’s hope our words are better than theirs,” Malik said, stepping toward the airlock. “Let’s go meet our neighbors.”

The hatch hissed open, and a ramp extended, the desert heat rushing in. Malik was the first to step out, his boots crunching against the sand. Behind him, Lin and Dr. Rassul followed, the latter already recording notes on a handheld device.





In the distance, a convoy of military vehicles approached, their dust trails rising like smoke signals. Helicopters hovered above, their rotors slicing the air in a rhythmic hum.

“Here they come,” Malik said, shielding his eyes from the sun. “Stay calm. Stay professional.”

Lin muttered under her breath. “Professional. Got it. No flipping off the guys with the guns.”

The convoy stopped several meters away, and soldiers disembarked, their movements precise and wary. General Perez emerged from an armored vehicle, flanked by a contingent of heavily armed personnel. She approached with measured steps, her eyes scanning the trio before her.

Malik stepped forward, raising his hands slightly in a gesture of openness. “General Perez. Thank you for agreeing to this meeting.”

She stopped a few feet away, her expression unreadable. “You’re braver than I expected, Captain. Most people in your position would’ve sent a drone or stayed in orbit.”

“Bravery or stupidity,” Malik replied, his tone light. “The line gets blurry sometimes.”

Perez’s lips twitched, almost forming a smile. “Let’s hope it’s the former. Now, let’s talk. But I’ll warn you—my patience for bullshit is thin.”

The dry, scorching wind swept across the barren desert as the two delegations faced each other like ancient armies on the verge of battle. General Perez scrutinized Malik’s team with sharp, assessing eyes. Her soldiers remained stoic, their weapons at the ready but not raised—a show of restraint that felt as fragile as glass.

“Captain Malik,” Perez said, folding her arms. “You’ve come a long way to talk. Let’s hear it. Why should I believe anything you say?”

Malik straightened, hands open and at his sides. “Because the truth doesn’t care about belief, General. What we’ve discovered—this connection between our Earths—changes everything. Deny it, dismiss it, call it a hoax if you want, but the facts remain. And we’re here to share them.”

Perez’s jaw tightened. “Share. Right. You mean study us like lab rats. Dissect our culture. Harvest resources.”

Dr. Rassul stepped forward, her voice measured and calm. “General Perez, I’m an anthropologist, not a spy. My only goal is to understand. Whatever similarities and differences exist between us are too important to ignore. Don’t you think your people deserve to know the truth?”

Perez’s eyes flicked to Rassul, narrowing slightly. “And if that truth is dangerous?”

“It always is,” Lin Tao interjected, her tone sharp. “But ignorance is worse. You think keeping your people in the dark will protect them? It won’t. Sooner or later, someone’s going to figure it out, and when they do, you’ll have a mess on your hands.”

Perez held Lin’s gaze for a long, tense moment before turning back to Malik. “Fine. Let’s say I’m willing to listen. But I want proof—real proof. Not pretty speeches.”

Malik nodded. “We anticipated that. With your permission, I’d like to bring you aboard our vessel. You can see the data for yourself, meet our crew, and ask any questions you want.”

Perez let out a sharp laugh. “You think I’m going to walk onto your ship, unarmed, surrounded by your people? Do I look stupid?”

“I wouldn’t suggest it if I thought you were,” Malik said evenly. “Bring a security detail if it makes you feel safer. We have nothing to hide.”





An hour later, the Arrow ascended, carrying Malik’s team, General Perez, and a squad of her most trusted soldiers. The atmosphere in the cabin was thick with tension, the Mirror Earth soldiers gripping their rifles tightly as they eyed every control panel and monitor.

Lin leaned toward Malik and whispered, “Pretty sure one of them is ready to shoot me if I sneeze.”

“Then don’t sneeze,” Malik muttered back.

Perez remained silent, her face a mask of control, though her eyes betrayed a flicker of unease as they broke through the upper atmosphere and the vast expanse of space opened before them. The Celestial Vanguard came into view, its massive bulk gleaming against the stars.

“Impressive,” Perez admitted begrudgingly. “Bigger than anything we’ve got. But big ships don’t make good intentions.”

Malik allowed himself a small smile. “No, but they do help keep everyone honest.”

The docking procedure was smooth, though Perez’s soldiers bristled as they disembarked into the Vanguard’s brightly lit corridors. Malik led them to a secure briefing room where holographic displays flickered to life, showing detailed scans of Mirror Earth alongside historical data from both worlds.

Dr. Rassul took the lead, her voice steady and authoritative. “General, what you’re seeing here is incontrovertible evidence. The geological records, the atmospheric composition, even the tectonic patterns—they’re identical to Earth’s. But it’s not just the planet. It’s the people. Your history aligns with ours almost perfectly until the late 21st century, when divergence begins.”

Perez’s frown deepened as the holograms shifted to show images of key historical figures, side by side with their Mirror Earth counterparts. “You’re telling me that our entire civilization is some kind of cosmic copy?”

“Not a copy,” Malik said. “A parallel. For reasons we don’t fully understand, our Earth and yours seem to have developed in near-perfect synchronicity. The differences we’re seeing now are the result of decades of divergence.”

Perez leaned back in her chair, her arms crossed tightly. “And what do you want from us? Cooperation? Trade? Access to our technology?”

“None of the above,” Malik said. “We want dialogue. Understanding. This is uncharted territory for all of us, and the last thing anyone needs is another Cold War.”





As the hours passed, Perez’s skepticism began to erode, replaced by cautious curiosity. Her soldiers remained watchful, but even they seemed to relax slightly as the discussions continued. By the time they returned to Mirror Earth, a tentative agreement was in place: a joint exploratory mission to uncover the origins of the two Earths and the forces that had linked them.

In the weeks that followed, a smaller, mixed team was assembled—scientists, engineers, linguists, and security personnel from both sides. The mission’s goal was ambitious: to explore the uncharted region of space where the anomaly connecting the two worlds was believed to exist.

For the first time in living memory, two civilizations separated by an impossible gulf had taken the first steps toward a shared future. Yet, as Malik watched the preparations from the Celestial Vanguard’s observation deck, he couldn’t shake a lingering sense of unease.

“Penny for your thoughts?” Lin asked, appearing at his side.

Malik gave a faint smile. “Just wondering how long this fragile alliance will last. Trust doesn’t come easy—not for them, and not for us.”

Lin snorted. “Trust is overrated. Mutual interest is what keeps people in line. As long as we’re useful to each other, we’ll manage.”





“Maybe,” Malik said. He turned back to the viewport, his eyes fixed on the distant starfield. “But if we’re wrong… God help us all.”",32,1735225199.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

It’s popped up again but this time it feels different I do get about 8-10h of sleep per day but my issue is that I sleep from 1-3am to 10am. I’m constantly waking up in the middle of the night so I never feel well rested. And when I am sleeping it feels as if I was half awake, so I wake up feeling like I remember the past few hours but can’t remember anything that happened in those hours. you get what I mean?

I really struggle to get to sleep no matter how tired I am, I often feel tired around 10:00 but just can’t sleep until 2am-ish. I am healthy. I do calisthenics every second or third day, track my calories and eat enough protein, carbs and fats. I consume little amounts of sugar and only ever have one coffee in the morning.

I have tried to pull an all nighter but those never have worked for me. I stay up the whole night and go to bed at 10pm, wake up at 7-8am and then fall asleep at 2am the next day.

I’m considering taking melatonin but in the past it has greatly affected my mood and gave me horrible headaches. I also grow tolerances to many kinds of medications quickly, so the dosage quickly goes up. Anybody have advice? Stuff like green teas and honey or any kind of foods don’t have an effect either.

Feeling a bit uneasy and hesitant about marrying my fiancée. Need some advice on how to improve my relationship and how to work on accepting my partner as is. 

We both come from south Asian backgrounds. 
been together for over 3 years now. First met in April 2021, were long distance for 18 months then moved in together since Jan 2023. Got engaged in Oct 2023 and bought a house together in Jan 2024. 

But about our beginnings: We met through a mutual friend and started talking online for first 4 months. First met her in April 2021, I had some hesitation (attraction-wise) then, but didn’t give up as I had never dated anyone who had similar values and minds. 
For 18 months, I used to fly down from Chicago every 2 weeks. Decided to move to her city, (Dallas) to give things a proper chance. Found a job and moved down to DFW. Bought a house together a year ago, been living together ever since. Things have improved a good bit since we bought the house, but I still haven’t been able to consistently accept her. 

Bit about me: Grew up in India, came to the US 15 years ago for undergrad when I was 19, got my masters degree in Electrical engineering and have been working as an engineer since 2019. I consider myself as kind but fair person. Funny at times but also bit weird (socially awkward). Love Nature and enjoy tinkering and fixing things. Passionate about my home, family and planet. Love helping people and volunteering my time at local places for the needy. Enjoy home cooked meals and working around the house. I do have a limited time left in US, due to the slow visa and residency restrictions. I’d have to return back to India in a year if I don’t get married. 

Bit about her, past and family: 
A kind hearted compassionate and simple minded girl. She was born in Pakistan and grew up in Dallas area since she was 5. She works as a civil engineer and stays with her dad until 2 years ago. She lost her mom when she was 17 and she’s the only child. She’s been a sole caretaker of her disabled dad for 15 years. Her dad has always been weak and disabled, but also one of the most narcissistic person I’ve known. She likes to explore parks, coffee shops. She enjoyed spending 1-1 time with her friends, who she calls as her family, which can be a bit tricky to navigate sometimes. 
She eats out most of the time, as it’s quick and convenient (which bothers me). Still, she tries to choose healthier options most of the time. Her loyalty and her empathy is one her best qualities. She can be a bit over emphatic sometimes and lose track of her own well being. She’s also comes across as people pleaser, so there’s that. She has dated 3 times before, engaged once. 2/3 guys she dated were taking advantage of her time and money and never really cared for her. She came to her senses and broke it off. Which shows that she has enough emotional maturity to see and think through things, which I admire about her.

When it comes to compatibility, 
We are both kind of introverted and enjoy 1-1 time with people instead of crowds. We both share similar core values and agree on many important things in life about health, family, money and career. Which has kept us together. Compassion, kindness, empathy and love for all beings. These are our basic values and they match well. 
When it comes to sex and fun, it gets a bit boring and basic.
In bed, she’s not very passionate or creative, even though she has had more experience. I try to initiate most of the times and we are active maybe 2-4 times a month. Really depends on her emotional state of mind. I’ve also become a bit less excited over time.  Still we have enough emotional intimacy that we feel good and happy after. I wish she would be a bit more relaxed and confident. 
In conversations and behavior, we mainly talk about day to day stuff. She loves talking about people in her life, which wasn’t the topic I used to care about. Often times, she comes across as a bit dull and monotonous. 
I struggle to find her funny or exciting when we are outside or doing fun stuff. 
I have come to terms with some of these incompatibilities as I still immensely care and love her.  But I still wish that she would be more imaginative, assertive and funny. 

Bit about our trauma and grief: 
While we were long distance, few months after I first met her, her work stress increased greatly. manager at her engineering job was micromanaging and being a jerk with her. It really hurt her and she couldn’t compartmentalize. This caused a good bit of stress in our relationship. Finally she was able to garner enough courage and confidence to look for other jobs and move to a much better workplace in March 2022. 
After moving down to Dallas in Feb 2023, she moved in with me in my apartment causing a bit of a rift with her dad. Her dad didn’t like me as much anymore as I was taking her daughter ‘away’. Even though we have been 10 mins away from his house. 
Either way, she went through a lot of grief processing when she realized how her dad doesn’t care about her, as he only cared about her being around and taking care of him. He does have home health services from Medicare, so a person comes and does a few of his chores 2-3 times a week. He will not consider moving to assisted living. 

At my apartment, I was there by her side comforting her and being supportive. But I was dealing with my own struggles as I had moved to a new city with a new job. So I got drained and became compassion fatigued. That year we had a lot of fights. But we still kept things going and stayed optimistic. We decided to look for house as my lease was ending, we finally bought one with some help from her cousins. We’ve been able to work on our relationship, while getting therapy and counseling and also giving each other space to heal. Since then, things have improved quite a bit. But I still feel a bit hesitant when it comes down to the life long commitment/settling down aspect of marriage. As much as I love her, I wish I was around someone who was a bit more exciting and fun. 


Coming back to present, many things have improved, especially our communication. 
We also understand each other better now. Also have more patience. This house has allowed us to be together without too much baggage. we are planning on getting married next spring 

The thing that bothers me now is her emotional and mental competence. 
She seems to understand my jokes and laugh at every one of them. But when she tries to be funny, it feels lame to me. I have rarely found her much funny or interesting. 
She isn’t totally predictable, but still her words and her thoughts are at most times. 

I guess what I am trying to say is, I don’t find my time as engaging and fun when I’m around her all the time. She seems bit too plain Jane to me. Bit too easy and boring, if I may. This does make it a bit difficult when it comes to trusting her with stuff or just listening to her. My admiration and my attraction for her goes down a bit due to this issue I have with her. 

tl;dr
First met in April 2021 through mutual friend. We’re long distance till 2023, living together since then. 
I find her conversations and her sexuality a bit boring and dull. Want to work on improving my perspective so I can find some excitement in her. She’s always up for trying new things and visiting new places. We both share a good sense of understanding and have lot of common core values. 

How do I work on finding that level of balance where I am not as bored around her but also not lose such a good soul from my life. ",1,1735225072.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

On the DF64, if I try setting 15, extraction is way fast. I'll pull 1:2 in 20s and the coffee is sour. I also sometimes see espresso squirting out at different angles from my bottomless portafilter. If I go finer by a few ticks ... say 11 or 12, then no espresso will come out, even after 50s. Pressure is set to 9-10 psi.

  
The coffee I've been using has been consistent. I'm aiming for 1:2 over 40-50s with 18g going in.

Is it normal for the grind range to be so tight? If I can hear the pump working, yet nothing is coming out, where is the water going? I'm not seeing any come out under the tray. I'm wondering if something is wrong with my machine. Thanks ahead of time for any advice you can provide.

We’ve retained her services for maybe 4 months or so now and generally are pleased with the extra set of helping hands around the house. 

The issue lies in me not being sure how to address certain things that I’ve noticed are now being overlooked…but were taken care of previously. I just want to be respectful but also would like to ensure her standard of cleanliness is being maintained…as that seems to be dropping…

Usually she arrives after the time she schedules with me…30 min or so…which is fine…we’re flexible, I’d just like to make sure the work is still being done…(she does not make up this time otherwise)

I’ve tried itemizing a list of things I’d specifically like her to help me with for that cleaning session. 
Kitchen (counters, sink, floors, wipe down appliances, dust) and bathrooms (tub, sink, toilet, mirrors)…vacuum/sweep/mop/dust the rest of the home…. We’re tidy people to begin with so there’s never anything I view as major that needs doing. 

Lately I’ve noticed she hasn’t been wiping down my kitchen counters (I’ll find crumbs sometimes or a coffee cup ring) , or cleaning the bathroom mirrors….(dust and toothpaste splashed on it…hard to see but it’s obvious it hasn’t been wiped at all) I’ve come home to large dust bunnies in the hallway, or noticeable marks still left on the floor. 

It kinda irks me because she always makes a point to do this elaborate origami type folding of all the toilet paper rolls/kleenex boxes/paper towel rolls she finds. It’s adorable and a nice touch but I’d rather her spend the time taking care of the floors and counters 🤷‍♀️.

I brought it up directly with her once and she apologized profusely and it got better for one session, then right back to the way it was before… 

I’m just at a loss now…I guess looking for advice on how to address things a second time. I struggle with being direct but would love to continue working with her. TIA",8,1735224824.0,housekeeping,12,0.9,False

1hmpru7,https://i.redd.it/om2aoeg8h79e1.jpeg,Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa: A Brew of Sweet Elegance and Spiced Indulgence.,"Sometimes, the best discoveries happen by accident, and that’s exactly how I ended up experiencing Lattafa Khamrah alongside Qahwa. When I ordered Qahwa, Lattafa’s coffee-centric gourmand, I was surprised to find Khamrah inside the Qahwa packaging. Although it took a lot of hassle with the seller to finally get my replacement for Qahwa, this mix-up gave me the chance to try both  fragrances—and I couldn’t be happier for it!

Fragrance Profile of Qahwa

•	Top Notes: Qahwa opens with a bold and aromatic blast of freshly brewed coffee, complemented by warm spices like cinnamon and cardamom. This opening immediately sets the tone for a more grounded and slightly masculine experience.

•	Heart Notes: The heart introduces creamy and sweet notes of caramel, praline, and toffee, balanced by nutmeg and vanilla. These add an indulgent, luxurious warmth to the fragrance.

•	Base Notes: The dry-down is smooth and comforting, with amber, tonka bean, and a hint of musk rounding out the composition.

Fragrance Profile of Khamrah

By comparison, Khamrah leans more into the gourmand side, with a decadent combination of cinnamon, vanilla, and tonka bean. While it shares a similar sweetness with Qahwa, it lacks the coffee note that makes Qahwa feel more grounded and masculine.

Why Qahwa Stands Out

After finally receiving Qahwa, I realized it was the fragrance that aligned more with my preferences. The coffee note adds a bold, aromatic layer that sets it apart from Khamrah, making it feel more sophisticated and versatile for different occasions. While I enjoyed the rich sweetness of Khamrah, Qahwa won me over with its perfect balance of sweetness and spice, underpinned by that addictive coffee base.

The Packaging Mix-Up Journey

The road to getting Qahwa wasn’t easy! After much back-and-forth with the seller, I finally got the correct bottle, but the silver lining of this mix-up was experiencing Khamrah. It gave me an unexpected appreciation for Lattafa’s artistry and how each fragrance shines in its own way.

Need some advice on how to improve my relationship and how to work on accepting my partner as is. 

We both come from south Asian backgrounds. 
been together for over 3 years now. First met in April 2021, were long distance for 18 months then moved in together since Jan 2023. Got engaged in Oct 2023 and bought a house together in Jan 2024. 

But about our beginnings: We met through a mutual friend and started talking online for first 4 months. First met her in April 2021, I had some hesitation (attraction-wise) then, but didn’t give up as I had never dated anyone who had similar values and minds. 
For 18 months, I used to fly down from Chicago every 2 weeks. Decided to move to her city, (Dallas) to give things a proper chance. Found a job and moved down to DFW. Bought a house together a year ago, been living together ever since. Things have improved a good bit since we bought the house, but I still haven’t been able to consistently accept her. 

Bit about me: Grew up in India, came to the US 15 years ago for undergrad when I was 19, got my masters degree in Electrical engineering and have been working as an engineer since 2019. I consider myself as kind but fair person. Funny at times but also bit weird (socially awkward). Love Nature and enjoy tinkering and fixing things. Passionate about my home, family and planet. Love helping people and volunteering my time at local places for the needy. Enjoy home cooked meals and working around the house. I do have a limited time left in US, due to the slow visa and residency restrictions. I’d have to return back to India in a year if I don’t get married. 

Bit about her, past and family: 
A kind hearted compassionate and simple minded girl. She was born in Pakistan and grew up in Dallas area since she was 5. She works as a civil engineer and stays with her dad until 2 years ago. She lost her mom when she was 17 and she’s the only child. She’s been a sole caretaker of her disabled dad for 15 years. Her dad has always been weak and disabled, but also one of the most narcissistic person I’ve known. She likes to explore parks, coffee shops. She enjoyed spending 1-1 time with her friends, who she calls as her family, which can be a bit tricky to navigate sometimes. 
She eats out most of the time, as it’s quick and convenient (which bothers me). Still, she tries to choose healthier options most of the time. Her loyalty and her empathy is one her best qualities. She can be a bit over emphatic sometimes and lose track of her own well being. She’s also comes across as people pleaser, so there’s that. She has dated 3 times before, engaged once. 2/3 guys she dated were taking advantage of her time and money and never really cared for her. She came to her senses and broke it off. Which shows that she has enough emotional maturity to see and think through things, which I admire about her.

When it comes to compatibility, 
We are both kind of introverted and enjoy 1-1 time with people instead of crowds. We both share similar core values and agree on many important things in life about health, family, money and career. Which has kept us together. Compassion, kindness, empathy and love for all beings. These are our basic values and they match well. 
When it comes to sex and fun, it gets a bit boring and basic.
In bed, she’s not very passionate or creative, even though she has had more experience. I try to initiate most of the times and we are active maybe 2-4 times a month. Really depends on her emotional state of mind. I’ve also become a bit less excited over time.  Still we have enough emotional intimacy that we feel good and happy after. I wish she would be a bit more relaxed and confident. 
In conversations and behavior, we mainly talk about day to day stuff. She loves talking about people in her life, which wasn’t the topic I used to care about. Often times, she comes across as a bit dull and monotonous. 
I struggle to find her funny or exciting when we are outside or doing fun stuff. 
I have come to terms with some of these incompatibilities as I still immensely care and love her.  But I still wish that she would be more imaginative, assertive and funny. 

Bit about our trauma and grief: 
While we were long distance, few months after I first met her, her work stress increased greatly. manager at her engineering job was micromanaging and being a jerk with her. It really hurt her and she couldn’t compartmentalize. This caused a good bit of stress in our relationship. Finally she was able to garner enough courage and confidence to look for other jobs and move to a much better workplace in March 2022. 
After moving down to Dallas in Feb 2023, she moved in with me in my apartment causing a bit of a rift with her dad. Her dad didn’t like me as much anymore as I was taking her daughter ‘away’. Even though we have been 10 mins away from his house. 
Either way, she went through a lot of grief processing when she realized how her dad doesn’t care about her, as he only cared about her being around and taking care of him. He does have home health services from Medicare, so a person comes and does a few of his chores 2-3 times a week. He will not consider moving to assisted living. 

At my apartment, I was there by her side comforting her and being supportive. But I was dealing with my own struggles as I had moved to a new city with a new job. So I got drained and became compassion fatigued. That year we had a lot of fights. But we still kept things going and stayed optimistic. We decided to look for house as my lease was ending, we finally bought one with some help from her cousins. We’ve been able to work on our relationship, while getting therapy and counseling and also giving each other space to heal. Since then, things have improved quite a bit. But I still feel a bit hesitant when it comes down to the life long commitment/settling down aspect of marriage. As much as I love her, I wish I was around someone who was a bit more exciting and fun. 


Coming back to present, many things have improved, especially our communication. 
We also understand each other better now. Also have more patience. This house has allowed us to be together without too much baggage. we are planning on getting married next spring 

The thing that bothers me now is her emotional and mental competence. 
She seems to understand my jokes and laugh at every one of them. But when she tries to be funny, it feels lame to me. I have rarely found her much funny or interesting. 
She isn’t totally predictable, but still her words and her thoughts are at most times. 

I guess what I am trying to say is, I don’t find my time as engaging and fun when I’m around her all the time. She seems bit too plain Jane to me. Bit too easy and boring, if I may. This does make it a bit difficult when it comes to trusting her with stuff or just listening to her. My admiration and my attraction for her goes down a bit due to this issue I have with her. 

tl;dr
First met in April 2021 through mutual friend. We’re long distance till 2023, living together since then. 
I find her conversations and her sexuality a bit boring and dull. Want to work on improving my perspective so I can find some excitement in her. She’s always up for trying new things and visiting new places. We both share a good sense of understanding and have lot of common core values.

1hmpo8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1hmpo8j/selfacceptance_being_selfdiagnosed/,Self-acceptance being self-diagnosed,"Hello there! I am happy to announce, that after more than ten years of self-doubt, suspicion and inability to get a proper assessment, I've decided to finally let go and accept myself as an autistic individual.

# A bit of history

My first exposure to autism (or rather Asperger's syndrome) happened when I was 14, through a game called To the Moon. One of the characters in the game, River, is mentioned to have some kind of diagnosis at one point (through outside sources it was confirmed to be Asperger's syndrome), and playing the game, I couldn't help relating to her far more than to any other character. I'd say far more than to any other character in general, despite me being a guy and it probably being weird that I relate to an autistic lady.

I quickly found online questionnaire to self-diagnose Asperger's Syndrome, and got high score. I felt like it all just clicked, it seemed to explain many of my struggles, the feeling of being an alien and all that.

Then the doubts started. As I learned more about autism, as well as I could in that age (should probably mention, that I might also have dyslexia, or at least struggle to read, so I didn't research scientific materials properly), it started to appear that I do not fit 100%, despite generally feeling like I do. The thoughts that perhaps it's just me wanting some kind of attention started to consume me. In order to put all these doubts to rest, I started seeking a way to get a proper diagnosis.

I knew there was a department of psychology in our local university. So, on open doors day I went there and asked if they could assess me. The woman gave me a surprised glance and said ""come in a couple of days"". So I did, anxiously anticipating the moment of truth the whole time. When I came there next time, another woman came to me, and immediately said the following ""No, I don't think you have Asperger's. It is a common experience to see conditions you read about in yourself, it happens a lot to medical students"". It was a bit of a letdown, but I didn't argue. Now, years later, I realize that there were quite a few things wrong with her assessment:

1. She was a psychologist in a university of foreign languages, not psychiatrist, and not even in a med school (that one was probably on me, since back then I didn't know the difference between psychology and psychiatry);
2. She concluded that I don't have Asperger's from the first glance, she didn't ask me a single question;
3. It might be just me, but isn't it kind of a telling sign that a 14 year old kid researches topics like Asperger's syndrome? I know something similar often happens to med students, but I never was a med student.

Nevertheless, that short interaction convinced me that I am probably fooling myself. Things that lead me to believe I was autistic in the first place didn't disappear, however, no matter how much I tried to convince myself that it's just my introversion, social awkwardness, and internal ableism that at times lead to self-loathing.

A few years later, out of curiosity, I've passed the autism test once again, and to my surprise, I still scored high. That started a loop of convincing myself that I was autistic, then brushing it off due to not being autistic enough, and some time later, passing another test. Usually my periods of ""convincing myself"" were me obsessively researching the topic, hardly thinking of anything else for extended periods of time.

I am in my late 20s now, and have passed countless tests over the years. I believe I might've passed every single test there is (I should probably mention that I did struggle understanding the questions, not because English isn't my first language, but because it's confusing. Only recently have I discovered that jumping over things probably doesn't mean literally jumping over things, like a rock or something. A year ago, still in doubts, I've decided to stop trying to understand questionable parts on my own and ask ChatGPT for clarifications, to make the test as accurate as possible, the results were the same though). Having a real life experience of moving away from my parents and working on quite a few jobs, retroactively opened my eyes on a log of my issues that I always brushed off as me being lazy or something. I realized, that I'm not actually lazy, and actually quite a hard worker. The problems with communication and mental distress that relations with my colleagues cause, are a huge problem that makes it nearly impossible for me to keep a job more than about 8 months, even if I actually like the job itself and my boss asking me to stay every time I announce my resignation. I've switched 8 jobs in a span of 2 years or so due to stress that would build up slowly over time with no way of relief. If anything, days off and vacations only made it worse due to the constant acknowledgment that I'll have to go back soon.

I've been unemployed due to a variety of outside and inside factors that I won't explain here. What's important, is that it allowed me to really look into myself and analyze my life more than ever before. I've spent a lot of time in this sub and in some other autistic communities, which allowed me to really see what autism really looks like, not in media, but in real life. And though there were a few points of disconnect that raise my doubts even now, I feel relatable to so many posts here, it's really ridiculous. 

The only thing that kept me from proudly claiming that I am self-diagnosed and not just suspicious is the stigma both in society and in my mind against being self-diagnosed. But lovely people in this community, on YouTube and on Tumblr, along with some real research, have convinced me that self-diagnosis is nowhere near as invalid as it is claimed to be, especially in a case similar to mine, when you spend years boiling with the idea and still come back to it despite everything.

Sadly, my closed ones, including close friend, girlfriend and parents don't believe I'm actually autistic and claim I'm probably just too self-conscious or something. It stings a little, but I hope I can live with it. I must admit though, quite a few of my other friends, who known me for years and have at least some understanding of ASD (either because they know someone diagnosed or were curious themselves and dove into the topic) said that I am most certainly autistic.

This is where I stand now. I do want to get an official diagnosis, but due to reasons outside of my control, it is impossible at the moment and won't be possible for quite some time. Other than tests, I've discussed this topic with ChatGPT, giving it a comprehensive amount of data on me, even asked it to be critical, and it still said that there's strong possibility of me having ASD. I've also made my own chatbot on roleplay platform, that was supposed to assess me, and to my surprise, it actually did. That last one was more of a silly fun thing to do than anything else though.

Hope my life's journey in relation of autism wasn't too long and boring to read. Bellow I plan to add a categorized list of things and behaviors that were deemed weird by others, that either make me think I have autism or could be explained by me having autism. Feel free to skip this part, as I'm adding it more for the self-reference than anything else, and plan to update it in the future in case I notice something new.

# Category A: Persistent Deficits in Social Communication and Interaction

**1. Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity**

* Difficulty engaging in conversations and connecting with people. I can communicate with one person, even though it's usually draining, but communicating with more than one person at a time, even if we are all good friends, usually turns into me becoming passive listener that tags along, due to inability to follow up and get into the conversation (often even if I try to get into the conversation, I am unheard due to my naturally quiet voice. Sometimes I almost scream to get into it, but it makes me feel awkward, so I generally don't do it). 
* I struggle to understand jokes and sarcasm. Here are an example: a mother of my girlfriend was talking to her husband, who's only home on weekends. It was on Monday, she he just left. She asked him where's the beer that was in the fridge (there was a lot of beer), and he told her that it got spoiled, so he threw it away. My eyes were wide with shock, I didn't know beer can spoil. Out of all people there (my girlfriend, her mother and I), I was the only one who didn't understand it was a joke. My sincere shock caused a lot of laughter too.
* Long pauses during speech, due to me struggling to consistently come up with what to say next, even if I have a general outline in my head.
* History of relying on online interactions to connect socially but finding this increasingly impossible. Due to finding it hard to have a verbal conversation, I prefer text chatting, which if often much easier and so much more enjoyable.
* Awareness of being socially awkward and possibly avoiding social interactions due to fear or difficulty. During my teens I was a lonely kid and rarely experienced good social interactions. I did crave them, but concluded I probably need better friends for it to feel good (my school friends weren't the best ones to say the list and often contributed to me feeling lonely and isolated). I later realized that I am actually much more comfortable on my own, even if people around me supportive and all that. Any meaningful interaction is draining and though I don't mind it occasionally, I am okay with it much less often than my friends would like to.

**2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors**

* I am often perceived as emotionless, especially in childhood. Parents told me I usually had a neutral face expression and having me smile or laugh was a rare occasion.
* When I was a kid, people often told me that I speak in monotone voice, which added to that perception of me being emotionless.
* I believe I am better at it now, but one of my few IRL friends often jokingly calls me a bioroobt, I suspect for that exact reason.

**3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships**

* This one mostly concerns my jobs. I could never find friendship, or even good relationship in any of the jobs I had. I could never really fit in into any group, be it school, university, or work environment, always being that weird kid with no friends. It was especially noticable in the university, where I only talked to a guy who was considered even more of an outsider than I am (I believe he had some significant issues, which made him look weird or even dangerous, but we got along alright actually). I don't think I was considered weird, but when this guy wasn't present, I was usually sitting alone, not talking to anyone, and didn't make a single friend during my time there.

# Category B: Restricted, Repetitive Patterns of Behavior, Interests, or Activities

**1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech**

* Sometimes, especially when I research something obsessively, I jerk my leg, without even noticing it. I've started noticing it in humorous situations lately, when I read about autism and it talks about stimming, only to realize I've been stimming in that exact moment.
* Sometimes, I feel the need to rub and pinch my eyelids and eyebrows. I used to do it a lot in school, some other kids even called me names for that. I don't know why I do that, it isn't pleasant, but if I stop in those moments I feel restless and even distressed a little.
* When I'm tired, I often close my left eye and look at the screen with only my right eye. It somehow makes it easier to focus.
* I've heard scripting might also fit here. When I worked in retail, I used to say ""Thank you, come again please"" to our customers when they bought something. But I also accidentally said that when I bought something in other places, instead of just ""thank you"". Other than that, I often feel an urge to quote different movies, memes and so on, even if it's probably not very appropriate (I taught my girlfriend on what Gachimuchi is, for her to better understand my references). Not sure if it's really a good point, but I'll leave it here for now.
* I only enjoy reading on Nintendo DS and from tiny books. I have a collection Shakespeare works in form of tiny books, roughly the size of PSP Go, or half the size of Nintendo DS. Not sure if it could be considered a stim, but I've decided to put it here just in case.
* Occasionally I like to hum a couple of notes, especially if I'm busy with something. It's not even close to a melody, it's just a couple of notes (if you played Demon Souls on PS3, you might remember in Prison of Hope, one of the prisoners was singing two notes over and over, my humming is similar to that, though I started doing it long before I ever had a chance to play Demon Souls)

**2. Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns**

* This one isn't exactly clear to me yet, but now that I have a lot of free time, I realized that I can't do anything without a schedule. In the morning I practice Japanese, and if I miss my morning practice, I will struggle to do it during the whole day and won't get anything else done, feeling terrible about myself. It happens every time.
* When I'm absorbed in something (like now), it's hard to stop even for just a moment to go to the restroom. Not sure how severe it is, but I know that feeling when you're really on the brink and have to run, because you were putting it up for later for far too long.
* I generally like following the same pattern everyday and sameness doesn't really bother me all that much, unless I am forced to do something that causes me distress (like work or spend significant time interacting with people).
* I have a unique approach in engaging with stuff. For instance, music (which will be explained bellow), games, movies, books and so on. If I am interested in a new piece of media as part of a long-running franchise, I will always engage with earlier works first and build my way up title by title in chronological order. In school I got interested in Doctor Who, I watched the teaser trailer for the Day of the Doctor, which is 50 year anniversary special and thought it was the coolest thing ever. Despite being interested primarily in the modern Doctor Who (just for reference, the series was cancelled in the 80s and soft-rebooted in 2005), I've forbidden myself from watching it before I'm finished with classic series that was being released from early 60 in black and white, which I now realize a very weird thing to do for a 15 year old. Similarly, when I got interested in the Legend of Zelda, I didn't go straight to Ocarina of Time or Wind Waker, but started with the original, its sequel and Gameboy games. Same thing with Mario, Resident Evil, Silent Hill and so on. Similarly, I prefer watching original classical movies, before watching the remakes. For instance, I watched original Ocean's 11 when I was 12.
* Similarly to what I've described above, I prefer taking apart dishes and eating it separately. For instance, I have a drumstick, mushed potatoes and some salad on my plate: I will first eat mushed potatoes, then salad and then drumstick. I only noticed it and realized it might not be considered normal, when my girlfriend pointed it out to me.

**3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus**

This one was hard for me to figure out, as I never viewed my interests as ""special interests"", but with some help from ChatGPT, I think I found a few. These aren't just my hobbies, but things that I persistently enjoy doing over long periods of time, that I can talk about for hours and that generally give me positive emotions, even if they take away too much time that gets in a way of routines (like now with me skipping my Japanese to write this text (I've been writing it for 2 hours now)).

* Autism. As evident from this post, both from my life journey and the fact I wrote it at all in the way I wrote it. I find joy in discussing it, in researching it and all that.
* Gaming. I wasn't sure this qualifies as a special interest until I recalled my early childhood experience. I wasn't a very talkative kid, but if you wanted to talk to me about games, I could talk for hours, feeling deep joy. I still enjoy it and have a private collection of articles I wrote when I had something to say about games I've recently finished.
* Music. I always had an opinion that no one like music the way I like it. Almost all of the people I ever knew viewed music as a more of a pleasant background noise. Meanwhile I often find myself listening to music alone, without getting distracted. I can sometimes go into a YouTube rabbit hole of listening to old but great songs, which can often get in a way of my sleep. I also have a varied taste in music. Whenever I like a song or two from one author, I download their whole discography and listen to all of their albums one by one in order of release. I believe it's the only right way of experiencing music. More than a half of my hard drive is filled with music.
* Handhelds. I've decided to put it into a separate category from games, because it's not so much about games as about the devices itself. Lately I rarely play my Nintendo DS, but I use it to read books and find it amazing on its own, even without games. Different handhelds from the past fascinate me, be it Wonderswan, classic GameBoy, PSP, PS Vita, 3DS, or even not a gaming device at all, but a portable computer, both old and new (like GPD Pocket - my dream machine). I have a small collection of handheld devices and at one point had a real rarity in our parts: a LG enV2. The phone didn't work in our parts, but it was such a cool curiosity, I still used it as a tiny typewriter for short notes.
* ChatGPT also suggested strong engagement in specific communities like this one. I believe it should reinforce the idea of it being a special interest, though I'm not sure.
* I have some unusual sexual kinks and can talk about them for hours, even when removed from sexual context. I didn't think of adding it initially, but not too long ago, when discussing the possibility of me being an extrovert as opposed to introvert (I am and always was an introvert), she mentioned that I can talk for hours about topics that interest me, including this kink. So I realized it might be a special interest for me, actually. I enjoy discussing it both form kinky perspective, as well as philosophical and practical, and I'm not sure which I like most.

**4. Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment**

* Discomfort at certain sounds. It's not something severe, I don't think I've ever been overstimulated to the point of significant distress. But I don't like high-pitched noises. When my dogs are playing with whistling toys, I can't focus on studies. I never use whistle on kettle, and manually judge when it's boiling. I turn of microwave oven a second before it goes off. I can't focus on much of anything (aside from special interests mentioned above) if there's popular music playing in other room, or my girlfriend watches TikToks (loud enough for me to hear) or hums along to a song in her headphones (or even listens to a song loud enough for me to hear despite her wearing headphones) next to me. Though good headphones help with that.
* I either can't or feel deeply uncomfortable eating certain foods. My body rejects salt-cured pork fat (a common dish in Ukraine) in the most intolerant way, though everyone else seems to enjoy it. I can't tolerate zucchini or eggplants in any form, be it pickled, fried, boiled or any other way. Whenever I even try to put it in my mouth, it causes me to spit it out due to vomit convulsions. I am slightly more tolerant towards onions, but I still find them deeply uncomfortable and pick them out whenever I can. When I have a meal with lots of fried onions, I usually leave like half or a third of it, due to the amount of onions left there makes it impossible to take them out. When I was young, I would often get stuck with different dishes, sometimes poking it for an hour at least with a fork, forcing it into me, before gathering the courage to ask parents to not eat it.
* Temperature sensitivity. I am much worse at tolerating heat than anyone I know and it also makes it hard for me to sleep in summer.
* Smell sensitivity: certain food, chemical and even perfume smells make me deeply uncomfortable, close to making me vomit, causing me to hold my breath until I can get out of the smell cloud.
* I cannot tolerate anything on my skin. No creams, lipsticks, or anything else that you're supposed to hold for a long time, it makes me uncomfortable enough to endure dry skin and lips (which often causes small tears on my lips to appear) in winter.
* I cannot read anything, if there's a significant movement in the periphery of my vision. If there's a non-stop playing gif under a post, I either have to cover it with my hand or scroll it out of the screen, before I can read the post. Similarly, I stop mid-word when reading a book and there's some movement on the background.
* Certain types of fabric irritate my skin without causing rashes or anything like that, though it's rare and I'd say probably not all that significant, so I'm not sure if it's really related.
* I am hypersensitive to caffeine. If I drink a cup of coffee later than 3PM, I won't be able to sleep in next 12 hours at least.
* I don't like being drunk and generally don't understand the appeal of being drunk.

I thought of adding some tendencies that I find unique and might be explained by autism, but couldn't think in which category to put it, but decided to not, as there's a high chance of my quirks being irrelevant to ASD. It's probably important to note a few points that always made me think I probably don't have ASD though. Here they are:

* I never experienced a meltdown. At least I think I haven't. I was considered a crybaby in my early childhood, and parents later told me that even a stern look at me could easily make me cry. But when I've read of experiences of other autistic adults with meltdowns, it seems so much more severe than anything I've ever experienced. I think, the only time I've experienced something similar is when overwhelmed by emotions: a death of loved one (caused me to cry most of the day for a month or two), a breakup (when I tried to breakup with my girlfriend, it caused me to cry to the point where it was hard to talk) and so on. It's hard to tell if that's it, since I don't fully understand what meltdown actually means (English is not my first language and though I am really good at it, I might be not good enough for that), and definitions don't help either. Somehow, when discussing meltdowns everyone here, in autistic community, seems to just understand what it means.
* Similarly, I don't think I've ever experienced shutdowns. I understand shutdowns as periods of muteness, inability to do much of anything and so on. I'm not sure if it's actually it. The closest thing I've felt is low energy periods. I could still talk, could still do the chores, but struggled to follow my routine even, and wanted to not think of anything hard. When I notice such period, I would usually play games or something, feeling bad for not following my usual routine of learning.
* I don't recall struggling with eye contact. When I'm conscious about it, I can look the person I'm talking to in the eyes. But only when they are talking, for some reason when I'm talking, I can't focus on looking them in the eye, instead looking elsewhere. I vividly remember my parents asking me to look them in the eye and me, not understanding how to look at both eyes simultaneously (I now can do it, by the way), looked between the eyes instead. When I worked in a small phone shop, I noted quite a few instances, when a person would come to the store, I saw them in the corner of my eyes, we started talking, discussed something, and only then I looked at their faces, realizing it took me so long to do it. So I might have some problems with I contact, but I don't think it qualifies.

If you've come this far, thank you for your time! If you have any thoughts, any at all, please leave a comment. Do you think some things I've described are irrelevant? Have thoughts on meltdowns, shutdowns and eye-contact? Please, share them!",6,1735224153.0,aspergers,17,0.61,False

1hmpn4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1hmpn4e/need_help/,Need help,"Hello everyone, and merry christmas. It's my first post on reddit ever. And I need help from people who seem to be more experienced than me.

First time in my life I was dumped by a girl I started to really like, no, not like... love. We've been dating for 3months. All began exceptionaly randomly and we always joked about it. She was first to make an ACTUAL move! Unbelievable, I know. Couldn't believe it myself as it was first time this has ever happened to me. Decided to find her on FB, messaged and offered to go out on a date (wasn't feeling much at the time yet, but decided to give it a shot). Fast forward a couple weeks, we went on a couple of dates, one was with my friends who had a chance to meet her, talk and have fun. They all said the same things I saw in her: smart, knows what she wants and is quite determined in her career. Dates were going well, we both made moves, without much hesitation, everything was flowing like never before in any relationship I had. Spent quite a bit of time chatting in between the dates, and should I say, both of us were quite flirty even while on the phone. I should mention that we have not spent a night together, most we did was kiss.

Fast forward to late November, out of the blue, on thursday she messaged me saying she will not be able to go out on a date on saturday (which didn't bother me yet as we only once managed to go out on a date we planned in advance, due to difference in our available free time). What did bother me was it was first time she did not suggest to reschedule, or anything to be blunt, she just explained why she couldn't go out. I suggested we meet up on friday as we both work close by and on fridays we end work at roughly the same time. So it's friday now, and I stayed at work for a bit longer due to some issues, messaged her after and went to shop close by. She called me, and said that she was tired and waned to go out for a coffee (I heard beeping of a cash register and understood that she was in the same shop). Jokingly asked if she was there and got an answer of:"" yes but I'm going home after, I'm tired and it's not worth going on a date"" (mind you I drive a car, she lives close by, and she is taking a bus). So I offered a ride but the moment I did she jokingly said:"" you're annoying"" and ended the call. I couldn't understand what just happened as she never did anything remotely close to this. I went back to my car and she messaged me saying she's sorry etc. she's tired and she wants to go home alone. I drove back home, messaged her good night and went to sleep. Saturday went on like nothing just happened, but on Sunday I woke up to a voice message saying that we should stop talking at this point as it's not working out due to: lack of time, her inability to reciprocate, our different interests and a lot of other bs which is all straight up incorrect. The only truly disgusting thing I heard which made my heart drop was (sorry for perhaps bad translation):"" We better try finding another person who can share each others interests in the future"". I offered solutions, yet nothing seemed to work for her, so I asked:"" do you have feelings for me?"" and got hit with ""no"". I ended the conversation shortly after.

Roughly a week later I decided to call her just to make sure, as none of this made sense to me and the only difference between the texts week prior was that she mentioned what she liked about the time together (in exceptional details) yet couldn't say anything bad even when I asked that she did. Also she couldn't talk straight, voice was shaky and uncertain, everything said was the same except the feelings part, she couldn't say it out loud. So I didn't get an answer. We talked for about 15mins. Wished her good luck and ended the call.

It's been 3 weeks since the last time we talked, we haven't blocked or messaged each other, but every time I open FB or messenger I can't help but check if she's online, or click on that stupid bubble to look at the last messages. It's incredibly difficult to let go of someone who did nothing wrong to you and I was ready to offer her for our relationship to be official yet everything came crashing down in a matter of a couple days (1 if you consider that at the time I couldn't figure out what happened on friday and saturday made me feel like she just had a bad day). I straight up cannot believe what she said, and considering that most of the reasons she mentioned were absolute insanity in the sense where if those were real issues, I would be the one mentioning them. She is good at communicating, yet on that day it felt off...

What do you guys think of this entire situation, I'm trying to let go, but I'm having issues, and I know that I hardly ever fall in love and it takes me time to do so, yet this time I did, and shortly after I got dumped which makes it so much worse. Be straight answering to this post, I do need serious help as I see myself digging an endless pit and I doubt my friends have anything new to tell me and only try to encourage me, yet I can't say it helps anymore as everytime I hear her name my heart fucking jumps to overdrive.

Let me know what you think about the chances I have that she might come back. And maybe some advice on how to try letting go for the duration as this shit is eating me alive. ",1,1735224056.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

* Jake is taking his sweet time actually starting Great American. Opens up almost immediately. The guys are giving us a lot of space. Then Joel and Ryan hit a lock step. Then they return to Great American briefly, and the next movement has Kris being a little bit more aggressive. Ryan playing something that kind of sounds like Immigrant Song. A nice dual guitar interplay. Back to Great American once more!

* Brendan says “You people are crazy. We were gonna play acoustic but it just didn’t seem right.” Joel adds “Doesn’t really work in this room you know?” Brendan “This is just screaming rock. You guys have any reasonable requests?” Lots of shouting. Kris goes “How bout some Christmas songs?” Then they rather ridiculously quote Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, and Kris schmalzily singing Let It Snow. “Let it snow baby. Let it snow alright? Might as well get used to it.” Lots of fun there.

* Intentions Clear! Pretty normal.

* Someone in the crowd requests Last Man Swerving. Lots more ridiculous quotes, they jokingly sing Staind, talk about nearby Rachael Ray cookbooks.

* And they do play Last Man Swerving! Joel’s vocals are pretty loud in the mix, I love that! When Jake takes his solos, it’s basically just noises. Joel seems to respond in kind. Now Brendan is playing Bridgeless underneath what they are doing.

* It’s Bridgeless for real, that was a slick segue! Pretty friggin’ tight all things considered!

* Crowd loved it! Jake goes “breakfast show!” Brendan adds “The authority figure that is Don is telling us we have ten minutes.” Crowd hates this! Joel says “That guy is nothing but bad news.”

* Q*Bert! Wow what a treat. Oh but they are done. Brendan jokes “Let’s just play that 5 more times in the next 10 minutes.”

* Kat’s Tune! Although they don’t really play so much as back Joel, working the crowd with silly Detroit baseball questions. BB again asks “Do you have a reasonable request?” Kris says it’s like the stock exchange over here as people hurl suggestions their way. Someone teases The Safety Dance. Brendan caught one of the requests: “Sleeve of Wizard?” Joel says “This is for all you fiction fans.” Brendan jokes “This is for everybody in the coffee shop writing nice poetry.”

* Wizard Burial Ground! When they get to Joel’s feature, he takes some great choices. Someone in the band calls out “Rick Wakeman!” Then before the flip Brendan says “Joel sing to us” and whispers “Merry Christmas. May all your holiday wishes come true this Christmas season. From Umphrey’s McGee!” He’s back again in the short break: “Thank you for shopping at Borders!” Jake is back with “Deck the halls with boughs of holly…” then he starts the ending. They must all be in great moods!

* Brendan: “Thank you guys for coming! We appreciate it!” Joel plugs: “Thank you guys. Alright so uh, we got a new live album, you guys probably know that. Live at the Murat. Recorded in Indianapolis. They got em here. And we’ll sign em for you in about five minutes on the other side of this wall if you want anything signed. Thanks again!

The moment I reached home, I gave them the gifts I set aside na alam ko matutuwa sila. Bought some grocery with them, and some chocolates. I can see the smile of my parents not with the things I provided but the moment that they've saw me in front of their eyes, after a year of working in Manila.

I really enjoyed the food that my mother is preparing each and every meal, breakfast is special mention. Then I asked my little brother to go out with me to buy some gifts for some of us that I haven't given yet. We enjoyed our chitchats and kulitan while we walked in the mall. He really appreciate every bit of things I bought for them, and even joked to him that I should go home on summer season instead of christmas. We both giggled while we are just together on the mall. Then the last day I asked my lil sister to join me and eat somewhere with good food and good coffee, we shared lots of chika and updates of how the year have been on our family, not that much but both of us are happy of how it went. Then checking my budget, I've seen I can stretch a bit more and bought an advanced gift for my mother a multipurpose oven. My mother is so happy the moment she saw the oven, imagine a kid opening a new toy, telling her to be gentle or she might slip it on her hand and break it while it has not been used. Out of worry, I helped her ""unbox"" the gift I gave her. 

With all these things, it made me realize that I should work harder. I want to give them better gifts on the next Christmas.

We had some nice interactions, and from time to time, she seems to be extra nice to me. However, I don't know if I'm being delusional or not. The thing is, I've always had something against asking someone out at their place of work. I  feel like everyone has the right to do their job without being bombarded with questions like these,  especially being a barista I feel like being hit on is not fun. But I've been a regular here for over 2 years now, so I'm not a stranger at all. And I don't want to make it awkward between us because I love going there, and I don't want to stop.

Here's the real question : I've dreamed up this script in my head. When I go to pay I'll ask if she can give me some advice. Basically asking her what her opinion is on asking someone out at their place of work. But switching the Cafe for a department store I have to frequent for work. And If she says go for it, tell her that the situation was, in fact, about her and ask her out there and then. Obviously if she says she wouldn't like it I wouldn't and I would just have to come up with something else. I hope this makes sense.

Please can anyone tell me if this is a good idea?

TLDR : is it a good idea to ask my crush out, but first testing the by asking her advice on my situation with her, disguised as a situation with someone else?

Hi everyone,

I think my Instagram account was hacked. When I try to log into Facebook, I get the message: *""Your Facebook account was suspended because your Instagram account fllisa\_gzefimov.070w0fpb doesn't follow our rules""* (see screenshot 1). However, that strange username was not the name of my Instagram account—it was something completely different.

Following the instructions provided, I attempted to appeal the decision by logging into the linked Instagram account. Unfortunately, I was redirected to a page stating that my Instagram account was suspended for violating community rules (see screenshot 2).

I last had access to my Instagram account on Thursday, 12/19. I haven’t posted anything on my account in over a year, though I occasionally shared very benign stories, like sunsets, coffee shops, or friends' weddings. I never received an email from Instagram or Facebook saying, *""You violated our terms""* or even *""Someone tried to log into your account"" / ""you logged in on a new device.""*

This account holds over 12 years of memories, and I’d really like to restore access but am pessimistic about the odds.

Here’s what I’ve already tried to resolve the issue:

* Most instructions for hacked accounts assume you can still log in to file a complaint. In my case, the account was hacked, violated regulations, and then disabled, so I can’t even request reconsideration.
* Whenever I follow the forms to appeal, I get stuck in a loop. It has me log in, then says, *""You can't appeal this.""*
* All phone numbers for customer support I found online don’t pick up.
* I’ve sent emails to [support@instagram.com](mailto:support@instagram.com) and [security@mail.instagram.com](mailto:security@mail.instagram.com), but I think the chances of them responding are slim.
* The only “success” story I’ve read about in a situation like mine (where the IG account name was changed and then shut down) was someone appealing to their state attorney general for ID theft. However, that post didn’t include clear instructions, and I’m not sure how the AG would actually help. (Link: [Quora discussion](https://www.quora.com/My-Instagram-has-been-suspended-and-it-affects-my-Facebook-What-should-I-do))

Does anyone have advice or insight on what steps I could take next? Also, I'm concerned because I had my credit card and home address linked in that IG account for purchases, so if I was indeed hacked, I wonder what the hacker got access to.

Thank you in advance!

Etc etc. In Spain I also remember being asked if I wanted the milk in my coffee to be hot or cold. 

Add to that am often noisy environment and a bit of stress at doing it all in a language you are still learning. Obviously I am not saying we shouldn’t be able to customise how we want our coffee but I think it’s often underestimated how difficult it can be as a beginner. On the other hand if you are able to do it then your level in that language might be slightly better than you think.

I’m from Papua New Guinea. I am roughly 5 foot 8, 65Kg, slim curvy built, brown skin with afro hair (Melanesian). I will send a picture through chats upon request.


Area of Study/work : IT & Project Management 

Hobbies/interests :  I enjoy visiting coffee shops and savoring a good cappuccino, especially in the company of people I love. I’m drawn to experiences that either excite or challenge me. I go on annual Daniel fasts to help me mentally, spiritually and physically. Building websites is another passion of mine—it’s a perfect blend of creativity and analytical thinking. I love watching sunsets and find joy in styling hair. I also love to spend time watching sermons and podcasts about spiritual growth and spiritual warfare, which rejuvenates me and brings me peace. Learning is a big part of who I am—when something sparks my curiosity, I dive into research or hands-on learning.

Christian Journey : I come from a catholic background. I’m no longer Catholic and since leaving I have been attending a variety of churches. I don’t have a specific denomination that I am attached to but I will say wherever the word of God & Fruits of the Holy Spirit is at the forefront I will be there. My relationship with God is very important to me and it has taught me significantly how to love, be kind, forgive, be empathetic, submit and giving to others. 

What sort of person am I looking for ? 
I am looking for my best friend, God Fearing future spouse, someone I can be a helpmate to and whom is capable of leading our future household as the head. I strongly believe that who people are in marriages are rooted from their single season hence I highly prefer a man who is actively pursuing a better life for themselves currently in their single season. Someone who is aware of spiritual warfare and understands what it means to not bring a knife to a gun fight. Someone I can talk to about Jesus Christ. I am on a celibacy journey therefore abiding by christian morals and values is important. Who you are right now matters more to me :)

Age Range : 25 - 36

Long distance/relocate ?

(she is in control bc it’s all on her phone plan and she pays for it while my fiancé is paying for the older child’s phone).
I then look online and sure enough the admin can remotely call in with nobody knowing and listen whenever they want to what’s going on.

A little background this woman hates me and has no boundaries. She was mad when she came to pick up the kids a few months ago that I was drinking coffee on my porch and asked my fiancé why I was there.

She has walked right past me and him at my house, no greeting, and walked into our house without permission with one of the kids. 

The daughter says her mother doesn’t like me and it’s hard when we are all together bc she knows her mother doesn’t like me.

Back to now, he asked his daughter about the watch and daughter says sometimes it rings and sometimes it doesn’t ring, and mom is just there so obviously she uses the feature.

I told her I don’t appreciate her sending something to our house that allows her to listen in whenever she wants with no warning. She pretty much told me to mind my own business bc it’s between her and “the father of her kids”. I told her the next time this happens we will have a problem and she accused me of “threatening” her. 

Fiancé says he understands my point of view, and says he will “ask her about it” and he doesn’t think she uses it. She LITERALLY got caught using and daughter says she uses it.

I stay away from her, don’t go near her, try to keep peace but she makes it impossible, plays victim. 

I am F50, he is M47.   He typically believes whatever she says. I envision her saying “I don’t use it (in spite of proof) and him saying “oh, ok”.

AITAH for wanting to be included in this? Their business is their business but this one issue involves me and my home.

My Breville Bambino Plus that I've had for two years started having some problems the other day after running a cleaning cycle. Now when I try to pull a shot, I get a bunch of water flowing into the drip tray, and nothing comes out the portafilter. If I run it with no filter or coffee, water does flow out of the group head. 

I have a descaling cycle with dezcal, and another cleaning cycle with no cleaning tablet, but that doesn't seemed to have helped.

I haven't found anything helpful on Google yet, and Breville's support site seems to be having some technical difficulties at the moment. So I'm hoping someone here has an idea about what's going on. Or is it time for an upgrade? 😁",2,1735222473.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

# Mitolyn Reviews

I remember the day everything changed for me.

I was sitting at my desk, staring at the mountain of unfinished tasks piling up like a to-do list from hell. My energy levels were at rock bottom, and no matter how much coffee I drank, it felt like my brain was running on fumes. I couldn’t focus, couldn’t think clearly, and the fatigue wasn’t just physical—it was mental, emotional, and relentless.

That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

Then came the physical changes.

I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn’t feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn’t just what I saw in the mirror—it was how I felt inside. There’s a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you’re living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn’t some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I’d been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised—and more.

Now, I’m not one to shout about products from the rooftops. But when something genuinely works, it’s hard not to share it. I went from being skeptical to becoming a believer, not because of flashy marketing or exaggerated claims, but because of results I could see and feel every single day.

If you’re feeling stuck—whether it’s low energy, brain fog, or the frustration of trying everything to shed those stubborn pounds—I can’t recommend this enough. It’s not just a supplement. It’s a tool to help you unlock the best version of yourself.

And trust me, once you feel what it’s like to operate at 100%, you’ll never want to go back.

## The Science Behind Mitolyn

What truly sets this product apart is the science behind it. This isn’t some gimmick or a trendy blend of random herbs. It’s a carefully formulated combination of ingredients designed to optimize one thing: mitochondrial health.

Let’s break it down.

Your mitochondria are the powerhouses of your cells, responsible for converting the food you eat into the energy your body needs to function. When your mitochondria are operating at full capacity, you feel energized, focused, and alive. But when they’re sluggish—thanks to stress, aging, poor diet, or environmental factors—you feel exactly how I used to: tired, foggy, and stuck.

The formulation is laser-focused on improving mitochondrial function and cellular energy production, and it does this with a blend of some of the most potent, natural ingredients out there.

Take **Maqui Berry**, for example. This superfruit is loaded with antioxidants that help reduce oxidative stress, one of the biggest culprits behind mitochondrial damage. By neutralizing free radicals, Maqui Berry protects your cells and keeps your mitochondria working efficiently.

Then there’s **Rhodiola Rosea**, a well-known adaptogen. This powerful plant helps your body adapt to stress, reducing cortisol levels and supporting your energy levels in a way that feels natural and sustained. No spikes, no crashes—just smooth, all-day energy that keeps you sharp and focused.

**Haematococcus Pluvialis**, or red algae, is another standout ingredient. It’s packed with astaxanthin, a compound known for its unparalleled antioxidant properties. But here’s where it gets interesting: astaxanthin doesn’t just protect your mitochondria—it actually enhances their function, helping them produce more energy at a cellular level.

And let’s not forget **Amla**—Indian Gooseberry. Rich in Vitamin C and other nutrients, Amla is a powerhouse for boosting your immune system and fighting inflammation. Inflammation is like kryptonite for your mitochondria, and by keeping it in check, Amla helps ensure your cells stay in peak condition.

Theobroma Cacao is another game-changer. Beyond being the source of chocolate (yes, chocolate!), this ingredient is loaded with polyphenols that improve blood flow and deliver more oxygen and nutrients to your cells. Better circulation means better mitochondrial performance, and that translates directly into more energy for you.

Finally, there’s **Schisandra**, a botanical treasure used for centuries in traditional medicine. It’s known for its ability to improve endurance, reduce fatigue, and even sharpen mental focus. Together, these benefits make it a key player in optimizing both physical and cognitive performance.

What I love about this formula is that it doesn’t just throw a bunch of trendy ingredients into a bottle and hope for the best. Each component has a specific purpose, backed by research, to support mitochondrial health and overall vitality. The synergy between these ingredients is what makes it so effective. It’s like giving your body a complete cellular tune-up.

But here’s the real magic: it’s not just about energy or weight loss or mental clarity—it’s about total well-being. When your mitochondria are functioning optimally, every system in your body benefits. Your metabolism speeds up. Your recovery time shortens. Your mood improves. Even your skin looks healthier. It’s all connected, and this product gets to the root of it all.

As someone who’s experienced these benefits firsthand, I can confidently say the science behind this product isn’t just marketing fluff. It’s the real deal. It’s why I went from barely making it through the day to thriving in every sense of the word.

If you’re looking for a solution that works with your body—on a cellular level, no less—this is it. It’s more than a supplement. It’s an investment in yourself, and the return is something you’ll feel in every fiber of your being.
