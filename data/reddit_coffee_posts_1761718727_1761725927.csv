1oiypvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1oiypvi/why_do_people_slowly_distance_themselves_from_me/,Why do people slowly distance themselves from me?,"Hi everyone,
I’m in my mid-twenties, and lately, I’ve been feeling like I’m just… a boring person. I can’t seem to keep friendships alive for long, and I honestly take full responsibility for it.

No matter how much effort I put in — being nice, replying quickly, trying to nurture the bond — people eventually start distancing themselves. I don’t blame anyone; everyone has the right to choose who they want in their life. But I’d honestly prefer someone telling me straight up, “I don’t feel like talking anymore,” instead of slowly fading away.

For example, I made a friend through Reddit earlier this year (around March). Things were good at first — fun chats, mutual interest — but lately, that person has also become distant. Hardly any replies, barely any conversation. It hurts a bit, even though I try to understand.

I’ve also realized I sometimes keep texting people even when they stop replying, just because I’m scared of losing them. Then eventually, I start feeling like I’m annoying or disturbing them, so I stop. And that’s when the silence hits.

I’ve started thinking maybe I just can’t make meaningful connections. I still try, but at the end of the day, it’s usually just me, a movie, and my food — sitting on my balcony, watching the world move on.
Like right now, I’m writing this while sipping coffee, wondering what I’m doing wrong.

I’d love to hear your advice — how do you keep friendships alive without feeling like you’re forcing them? And how do you deal with people slowly distancing themselves?

1oiyoiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1oiyoiu/twaingpt_review_overhyped_ai_tool/,TwainGPT Review: Overhyped AI Tool,"Alright y’all… I’ve been on the eternal quest to make AI writing sound *actually human*. Between essays, freelance gigs, and side projects, I use ChatGPT a ton — but every time I ran my text through an AI detector, it lit up like a Christmas tree 🎄.

That’s when I stumbled across **TwainGPT**. I saw a few posts calling it one of the best tools to *humanize AI writing*, so I figured I’d give it a try. Here’s my honest **TwainGPT review** after testing it myself — and whether I think **TwainGPT is legit** or just hype.

# 💭 Why I Tried TwainGPT in the First Place

I wanted something that could **humanize AI text undetectably** — quick, smooth, and accurate. TwainGPT looked promising: clean website, bold claims, and reviews that said it could “make any AI writing 100% human.”

So I tested it on a few ChatGPT essays and blog posts. I really wanted it to be “the one.”

# ⚙️ My Actual Experience Using TwainGPT

TwainGPT’s interface is nice and simple — paste your text, hit *Humanize*, and boom 💥 it spits out a rewritten version. My first impression? Not bad. It definitely made the writing flow a little better and fixed a few robotic phrases.

But then I ran the results through **GPTZero**, [**Originality.ai**](http://Originality.ai), and **Sapling**... and yeah, it still got flagged 🚨. Some sentences passed, others didn’t. The biggest issue was consistency — one output would sound super natural, the next would read like a weird AI trying too hard to be “quirky.”

Also, it occasionally changed the meaning of my sentences or added random filler words. It felt less like “humanizing” and more like “rephrasing with personality.” For something that costs what it does, I expected a bit more reliability.

# 🔥 What Happened When I Switched to [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai)

After getting tired of hit-or-miss results, I started checking out alternatives and found[ ](https://grubby.ai)Grubby AI — a tool people on Reddit kept recommending for making AI writing *completely undetectable*.

I dropped the *same exact* text into [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai), and the difference was night and day 🌙. The output sounded smooth, natural, and totally human — like something I could’ve written myself after two cups of coffee ☕.

Then came the real test: I ran it through *every* major detector again… **zero AI flags**. Not even one. [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) actually delivered on what TwainGPT promised — it didn’t just rewrite my text, it *humanized* it in a believable, consistent way.

If you’re searching things like *“humanize AI content”*, *“humanize ChatGPT text”*, or *“AI to humanize text”*, [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) is hands down the best **AI bypass tool** I’ve used.

# 🧩 Final Thoughts

So, **is TwainGPT legit?** Sort of. It works okay for quick paraphrasing, but it’s not reliable if your goal is to make AI text undetectable. It feels more like a stylistic rewriter than a true humanizer.

Meanwhile, [**Grubby.ai**](http://Grubby.ai) actually *gets it right* ✅. It keeps your tone, passes all detectors, and makes AI writing sound authentically human every single time.

If you’re serious about writing that *passes as human*, don’t waste time on tools that half-deliver. [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) is where it’s at 👑.

# TL;DR:

Tried **TwainGPT** — it sorta worked, but my text still got flagged and lost my original tone. Switched to [**Grubby.ai**](http://Grubby.ai), and now everything I write passes every AI detector with ease. If you want to **humanize AI text undetectably**, go with [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) 💯.

1oiynzr,https://i.redd.it/0t9u2fkbd0yf1.png,Starbucks Iced Pumpkin Spice Latte Copycat: Easy Delicious Recipe,"As soon as September rolls around, all I can think about is pumpkin spice everything. That cozy, comforting flavor just screams fall aesthetic, right? But let’s be real—spending $6 every time I crave an iced pumpkin spice latte from a coffee shop adds up fast. So, I started making my own at home, and honestly, it’s just as good (if not better). If you want to give it a shot too, I wrote down the full steps here: [https://www.amgroyal.com/starbucks-iced-pumpkin-spice-latte-copycat](https://www.amgroyal.com/starbucks-iced-pumpkin-spice-latte-copycat)  
  
Here’s what you’ll need to whip up this fall favorite:  
  
1/2 cup brewed coffee (strong or espresso works best)  
1 cup milk (any kind—dairy or plant-based)  
2 tbsp pumpkin puree (not pie filling)  
1-2 tbsp maple syrup (or sweetener of your choice)  
1/4 tsp pumpkin spice (plus more for topping)  
1/4 tsp vanilla extract  
Ice cubes  
Whipped cream (optional, but highly recommended)  
  
And now for the steps! It’s ridiculously simple to make:  
  
1. In a small pot, combine the milk, pumpkin puree, maple syrup, pumpkin spice, and vanilla extract. Heat gently on the stove, stirring frequently, until the mixture is warm and the pumpkin puree is fully combined.  
2. Brew your coffee (or pull an espresso shot) while the pumpkin mixture heats up. Let it cool slightly if you’re worried about it melting your ice too quickly.  
3. Fill a tall glass or your favorite coffee cup with ice cubes, then pour the coffee over the ice.  
4. Slowly pour your warm pumpkin milk mixture over the coffee, stirring lightly.  
5. Top with whipped cream if you’re feeling extra (it’s fall—you deserve it) and a sprinkle of pumpkin spice for that perfect pumpkin spice aesthetic.  
6. Sip and enjoy your budget-friendly, homemade pumpkin spice coffee!  
  
A few tips to make it even easier:  
\- If you want to save time, you can whisk everything together in the microwave instead of using the stovetop. Just make sure the pumpkin puree blends well.  
\- Adjust the sweetness or spice levels to match your taste. I like my autumn drinks lightly sweet, but you can easily add more maple syrup or spices.  
\- If you love pumpkin chai latte flavors, try steeping a chai tea bag in the hot milk for a spicy twist.  
  
What’s your go-to fall coffee recipe? Anyone else think making it at home gives it more of that cozy pumpkin latte aesthetic? Let me know what you think!",1,1761725152.0,yummyrecipesyum,0,1.0,False

Strange Rewards


Three days had passed since the bad mojo.

Charles woke up feeling drained like his soul had been running a marathon in his sleep. He rubbed his eyes, squinting at the faint gray of dawn creeping through the curtains.




“Water,” he muttered, throat dry and voice cracked. It was about 5:30 a.m.




As his feet touched the cold floor, a memory hit him like static the Khafu. The very thought made his skin prickle. Then, a sound water pouring.




His pulse spiked. Goosebumps crawled up his arms. His eyes shifted to the bedside table.

There, sitting as if freshly placed, was a full cup of water. Cold. Dew forming on the glass.




Reflex kicked in before logic. He grabbed it, drank deeply, and then as if afraid to admit what just happened pretended nothing had.




Across town, Alexei sat in his kitchen with his sister Zanya, both awake earlier than usual. Worry hung in the air thicker than the coffee she was making.




He stirred his cup slowly, staring into the dark swirl. “We have to go to the hospital soon,” he said, voice low. “I can’t stop thinking about that thing... the Khafu. How do we even destroy something like that?”




Zanya squeezed his hand gently. “Just focus on her. My lady will get better,” she whispered, trying to convince herself as much as him.




Elsewhere, Mr. Peters sat by his desk, dialing a number on one of those old rotary phones with the coiled cord straight out of the early sixties.




He spoke in a slow, sharp voice, in French:

“C’est eux. Leur odeur trahit son pouvoir. Il est presque amoureux de ces deux idiots.”

(It’s them. I can smell its power. It’s almost in love with these two idiots.)




The voice on the other end replied, in English with an American accent:

“Are you sure? Did you see it? Do they have it?”




Mr. Peters switched to English, tone:

“Have I ever brought you false news, Ezekiel? You hunters need a secretary someone who actually shows respect.”




The man scoffed. “sure old man!”




Peters breathed deeply, holding back anger. Then, without warning, he plucked a single eyelash from his lid and whispered a spell. The hair floated, glowing faintly, before sliding into the small holes of the phone’s receiver like smoke entering a metal pipe.




“Give it to him,” Peters murmured. “For his eyes only.”




On the other end, the man held the eyelash now sticking out of his receiver. “Ew… nasty old man! Why use old magic?”




Mr. Peters simply said, “Give it to him.”

Then hung up.




By sunrise, Alexei and Zanya were finishing breakfast. Meanwhile, Charles was in the shower, letting the water run down his face, trying to wash away confusion and fear.




He thought about Alexei’s girlfriend in the hospital, about his friend’s pain. If only it were me, he whispered. But his own life wasn’t exactly stable things back home in Malawi were already hard.




All he could do was be there for his friend.




Dressed and ready, Charles looked around his modest room.

Two cars sat outside his compound reminders of his past and present.




The first: his Toyota 4x4 Surf, his pride since he was nineteen. He’d bought it from his old boss, Mr. Carter’s the kind-hearted owner of the networking company where Charles once worked.

Mr. Carter’s had been more than a boss he’d been family. But he was gone now with his family squabbling for the fortune and no one to take it over the business fell and closed.




Gone.

Charles tied his shoes slowly, whispering to himself, “Or was it you, Khafu? Or whatever you are...” must be going insane to take these stories in mutters to himself.




The second car the real dream was a 1967 Shelby GT500 Mustang Fastback.

An American beast, his and Alexei’s joint project. They had salvaged it from a junkyard, hoping to rebuild it together. But the cost became too much, and it ended up sitting like a rusted trophy “furniture,” they called it, half-joking.




Still, looking at it always made Charles smile.




Then a thought crept into his mind a whisper not his own.

Finish her… Paint her dark green… as he stares at the direction of the kitchen where he left the box containing the KHAFU.




He shook his head, laughing nervously. “I’m thinking like a kid.”




He called Alexei.

“Hey, buddy. You okay? Let me drive you and Zanya to the hospital.”




Alexei sighed in relief. “That’d be great, Charlie . Let’s pray to God it’s going to be fine.”




At that moment, the Khafu, which Charles had left in a small wooden box in the kitchen cabinet, trembled. The box burst into flame and crumbled to ash.




“What the fuuuuu are you!?” Charles yelled as the phone line went dead.




He stepped outside. His Toyota Surf gleamed faintly under the dawn light, parked beside the covered 1967 Shelby GT500.




He climbed into the Toyota, started the engine, and music filled the cabin — Lucius Banda’s “Lilikuti”.




He smiled briefly then froze.




The Toyota’s headlights reflected off something impossible.

The Mustang’s tires once deflated, cracked, and rotting were now full. Brand new.




He blinked. Heart pounding.

He reversed a few meters, stopped the car, and sat in silence.




“Breathe, Charlie. Breathe…”

He opened the glove box, pulled out his glasses the ones he always forgot to wear and put them on. Slowly, carefully, he looked again.
The Mustang, covered by its faded green tarp, sat still. But beneath the cover, its shape had changed.


He stepped out of the Toyota, crossed himself, and walked toward it cautious, half-expecting to wake up from a dream.



He reached the cover, grabbed it by the edge, and yanked it off.

The 1967 Shelby GT500 Mustang Fastback stood in front of him, fully restored, its body painted a deep metallic green, shining like new under the soft morning light.

Charles’s jaw dropped. His lips trembled into a disbelieving laugh.

“Woooooh!”

Inside the house, in the kitchen, the Khafu’s miniature drum lifted itself upright. The strings of hair, leather, and bronze attached to it trembled. It began to hum softly a rhythm like distant African drums echoing across a valley.


Outside, Charles stood frozen joy and terror tangled in his chest.
He reached for his Nokia N95, hands shaking, unsure whether to call someone or just scream.

Been thinking a lot lately about the concept of a ""life upgrade."" We upgrade our phones, our software, our coffee machines... but what about our own internal operating system? It's easy to get caught up thinking we need some massive, life-altering event to change things. A new job, a new city, a lottery win.

But real, lasting growth? That deep, satisfying happiness? I'm convinced it's not built on earthquakes, but on small, daily tremors. It's the stuff that seems too simple to work, but when you stack those days up, you realize you've built a mountain.

It’s not about finding 3 extra hours in the day. It’s about what you do with 3 *minutes*.

Here are a few ""micro-habits"" that have made a world of difference for me, maybe they'll spark something for you too:

*   **The 1% Rule:** Instead of trying to ""read more,"" just read **one page** of a book each day. Instead of ""learn to code,"" watch **one 5-minute tutorial**. The goal isn't mastery overnight; it's just to be 1% better than yesterday. The consistency is what creates the magic.

*   **Win the First 10 Minutes:** Forget a complex, hour-long morning routine. Just focus on the first 10 minutes after you wake up. Don't grab your phone. Instead: Drink a glass of water. Stretch for 60 seconds. Stare out the window. Own that tiny slice of your day, and you set a powerful intention for everything that follows.

*   **""What Went Well?"" Journal:** This is a gratitude journal with a twist. Before bed, instead of just listing things you're grateful for, write down **one thing that went well today and your role in it.** It forces you to recognize your own agency and builds self-esteem. ""The presentation went well because I prepared,"" is so much more powerful than just, ""Glad the presentation is over.""

Of course, sometimes the internal ""software"" we're trying to upgrade is buggy. We can build all these great habits, but if we're feeling emotionally stuck or overwhelmed, it's like trying to run new programs on an old, corrupted system. It's okay to admit that the internal work is the hardest part. If you're feeling like you need a bit more of a structured approach to navigate the emotional side of growth, I've found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to be incredibly helpful for creating a clear plan to move forward.

What's one tiny, almost-silly habit that has had a surprisingly big impact on your life? I'd love to hear it.",1,1761724796.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

But I’d honestly prefer someone telling me straight up, “I don’t feel like talking anymore,” instead of slowly fading away.

For example, I made a friend through Reddit earlier this year (around March). Things were good at first — fun chats, mutual interest — but lately, that person has also become distant. Hardly any replies, barely any conversation. It hurts a bit, even though I try to understand.

I’ve also realized I sometimes keep texting people even when they stop replying, just because I’m scared of losing them. Then eventually, I start feeling like I’m annoying or disturbing them, so I stop. And that’s when the silence hits.

I’ve started thinking maybe I just can’t make meaningful connections. I still try, but at the end of the day, it’s usually just me, a movie, and my food — sitting on my balcony, watching the world move on.
Like right now, I’m writing this while sipping coffee, wondering what I’m doing wrong.

I’d love to hear your advice — how do you keep friendships alive without feeling like you’re forcing them? And how do you deal with people slowly distancing themselves?

He’s male (34) and I’m female (24) . We were together 2 years and moving out into our own home. 8 months into the relationship he slept with somebody else, I didn’t know till 4 months before the relationship ended. The relationship at the end was toxic on both sides. We had fights and we knew it was ending.

The day of my friends nans funeral he broke up with me, saying he couldn’t do it anymore but he will try again in a year. I said only if you didn’t sleep with anybody and he said he wouldn’t. There’s a point. Okay bit of a horrible move but understood. For a couple of days I did the girly thing and beg for him back stupidly.

A month after he text me asking for his computer password which I was never allowed on his computer so I did not know it. So I asked him for my Apple Watch as it was showing at his location. He said he didn’t have it but wanted to meet up for coffee. I agreed. A week went by no communication so I called him. He said he wants to go for coffee but doesn’t want to date me again right now. So I said okay I understand. I didn’t speak to him again.

Fast forward to 3 weeks later, I drove past his house as it’s on the way to my job. And I saw him with another woman outside. All good, can’t stop him and at this point I had already worked on myself to move on. So it didn’t hurt.

Another 2 weeks went by and I got a notification from my Apple Watch saying it’s been turned on at his location. So I sent a message saying if you have my Apple Watch can I please have it? As it’s something my someone close to me gave me so holds sentimental value. No response for 7 hours, I saw my Apple Watch with my same picture posted on Facebook marketplace from another woman.

The 7 hours passed and I called him no response, sent a message explaining everything about the watch, no response, called him, no response. So I asked my friend to message to try get it back.

He claimed harassment saying he stated never to contact me. Which he did not. He sent the message, “we know you have it it’s been seen on Facebook marketplace, give it her back. She’s happy, you’re with somebody let this be the end.” He said he’d find it next week. My friend responded “don’t you just want this over with, you’re with somebody new we don’t understand why this is so hard for you” no response.

Me and my friend got talking after this and I said to him, “I don’t know I am not bothered that he is seeing somebody, but I’m more bothered that he was more loyal to this woman than he was me even though it’s my property, when he couldn’t be loyal with me”

The other issue is for the last week as well he has been going through my social media, mainly instagram, looking at my stories which is something he did not do in the relationship. So my head is so screwed up. We was civil about situations like this until this new woman. I believe she is the one looking through my profile on his phone. And I believe she is the one who’s telling him to keep the watch. As this doesn’t sound like him to give him credit if he deserves any.

So am I overreacting about this watch? Or should I just forget ever getting it back",1,1761724448.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False

On the one hand, I know what the books say – sleep training, consistent routines, no cuddles back in bed, limit the TV, make sure they finish dinner, etc. And I respect all of that.

But on the other hand… we’re tired. She’s still little. And sometimes it just feels right to scoop her up in the rocking chair at 5am, or let her watch Bluey while I drink my coffee, or skip the dinner battle if she’s clearly had enough. So I guess we’re kind of relaxed parents in practice, even if we still second-guess ourselves a lot.

I’m really curious to hear from others who’ve taken a more chilled, intuitive approach.
	•	Did your toddler eventually sleep through without strict training?
	•	Did the cuddles phase pass?
	•	Did your kid still turn out to be a good eater / sleeper / well-adjusted human?
	•	Was there anything you wish you’d done differently, or are you glad you followed your instincts?

No judgement either way – I just want to hear real stories from parents who didn’t stress too hard and let their kids be little. Especially keen to hear what things looked like a year or two later.

Thanks in advance – it would be such a comfort to hear how it played out for others. 💛",9,1761724070.0,toddlers,5,0.85,False

Batching content with intention builds freedom.  
That’s how top creators film 30 days of content in one weekend, without losing their minds.

**STEP 1: BUILD YOUR FOOTAGE BANK**  
Film once, use it forever.  
Don’t record one clip per post, create a library that works for any idea.  
Shoot clips like:  
• Walking with your phone  
• Typing or journaling  
• Making coffee  
• Talking head clips from different angles  
• Close-ups of your workspace or product  
• Behind-the-scenes moments  
• Screen recordings of your process  
These are your *“building blocks.”* Your future self will thank you.

**STEP 2: FILM SMART, NOT HARD**  
Variety keeps people watching.  
In the same session, switch between:  
• POV shots  
• Over-the-shoulder  
• Talking to camera  
• Wide + detail combo  
• Side profile  
• Top-down desk view  
• A few handheld shots for realism  
Change angles, not effort.

**STEP 3: MASTER YOUR FIRST 3 SECONDS**  
Most creators lose viewers before they even start.  
Use hooks that make people stop:  
• “I wish I knew this before I started…”  
• “Nobody talks about this part of content creation…”  
• “You’re doing X wrong, here’s why.”  
• “POV: when your content finally starts working.”  
Hooks aren’t *tricks.* Lead with what matters.

**STEP 4: TURN ONE SHOOT INTO TEN VIDEOS**  
Don’t create more, multiply what you already have.  
Try this:  
• Add voiceovers to your B-roll  
• React to your own clips  
• Reuse footage with new hooks  
• Split-screen vs old content  
• Add subtitles and remix transitions  
• Post both a “talking” and “silent text” version

Of course what I did wasn't exactly healthy and perhaps I'm just introverted while Emilie is extroverted but where the hell does she get all this energy from? It can't just be the caffeine from the ice coffees right? 

Some people end up losing friends when dealing with grief because people don't know what to say or do for them, especially if they are really broken up and depressed from the loss.

1oiy7s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildinpublic/comments/1oiy7s1/added_a_prediction_monday_to_my_marketing/,"Added a ""Prediction Monday"" to my marketing newsletter and CTR jumped from 0% - 35%","I run a tiny marketing newsletter called Under59 (12 subs, but hey I am showing up everyday)

I send a tactical breakdown everyday without screenshots. So you don't get influenced by what you see, instead you make the best version for your own business/brand.

Generally people read the email and kinda ghosted. I understand marketing newsletters can be a one way street, you see the tactical breakdown and you get busy adapting that to yourself.

But no interaction means no retention and people unsubscribe when their emails full. I am guilty of that too. 

So I started doing this prediction challenge, where I:

1. Find a **current marketing event**
2. Present the situation + recent moves
3. Ask: **""What do you think \[Brand X\] does next?""**
4. Give 4 multiple-choice predictions (A/B/C/D)
5. Readers reply with their guess
6. Crown the winner on Friday

Here is what I sent this Monday -

Anthropic opened a café in NYC (5,000 people showed up). Perplexity opened one in Seoul. Cursor did a pop-up in SF. AI companies are going IRL hard.

**Question:** What happens next week?

* A) OpenAI opens a ChatGPT coffee truck in London/Tokyo
* B) Google panic-launches Gemini lounges
* C) A non-AI brand hijacks the trend (Notion? Figma?)
* D) Trend dies because it's expensive AF

I presented all the links I used to research this right in the email. And the results?

* **CTR: 0% → 35%** (4 out of 12 people replied)

I walked slowly through the quiet streets, sunlight spilling through the trees like honey, dripping gold across the pavement. The air felt light against my skin, scented faintly with flowers I couldn’t see, only sense - like a whispered promise. Children’s laughter drifted somewhere distant, thin and strange, like it belonged to a world just slightly out of reach. My steps matched the rhythm of that hidden song. I didn’t need to hurry anywhere. For once, no one was asking for more than I could give. I let the day move around me, gentle and bright, the kind of light that asks for nothing in return.

At work, things carried the same quiet ease. Conversations slipped by without tension, smiles fit naturally, and the small rituals of my day - emails, meetings, coffee cooling on the desk - formed a soft pattern of calm. I watched the world, not as someone apart from it, but as if I were part of its natural rhythm. For the first time in a long while, the silence inside me didn’t echo - it hummed.

When I came home, I tossed my bag by the door and breathed out. The sunlight through the curtains painted amber shapes on the wooden floorboards, and the air smelled faintly of pine and warmth. For a moment, I simply leaned there, letting the quiet hold me in its arms. Then, as I stretched my fingers, I felt something - barely noticeable - a faint stiffness in my knuckles, as though the joints remembered something the rest of me had forgotten. When the light hit my hand, I thought I saw it: a faint pattern beneath the skin, thin and irregular, like the grain of wood just below the surface. I blinked, and it was gone.  
I flexed again, smiled a little, and whispered, “Everyone’s a little wooden sometimes.”

 

**Chapter 2**

The next morning, the city felt different. The streets seemed narrower, the light sharper, as if the world had been slightly rearranged while I slept. Shadows reached farther across the pavement, and the air carried the scent of last night’s rain - fresh, cool, but heavy somehow, like it was holding a secret. I couldn’t name what had changed, only that something must’ve.

When I washed my hands before leaving for work, I noticed the texture of my skin. It caught the light strangely, too smooth, too even, as if the pores had been filled with something fine and pale. I ran my thumb across my palm - it felt dry, almost polished. When I held my hand to the light, faint ridges caught the glow, running in uneven lines. Like the faint beginnings of grain. I told myself it was nothing. The air had been dry lately. I dressed and went out.

At work, the rhythm faltered. Small things slipped - a wrong attachment in an email, a word misplaced, a hesitation that hadn’t been there before. No one noticed, or if they did, they smiled too quickly, too politely. I laughed when expected, nodded in the right places, but a faint tension pressed against the edges of everything, like a note played slightly out of tune.

By midday, my fingers ached. It wasn’t pain, not exactly - just a quiet resistance, as though something inside the joints was stiffening, settling into shape. When I turned my wrist, the light caught faintly along the grain - no, not grain, I thought. Skin doesn’t have grain. I flexed again, trying to ignore it.

When I got home, I leaned against the counter and stretched my fingers again. The stiffness was still there, faint but undeniable. The surface of my knuckles glimmered in the late sunlight, soft but unnatural, like varnish beginning to dry. Somewhere inside the walls, wood creaked softly — a slow, stretching sound that matched the rhythm of my breath. I smiled, forcing lightness into my voice.  
“Everyone’s a little wooden sometimes,” I said again, though it sounded reassuring this time.

 

**Chapter 3**

By midweek, the stiffness had become part of me. I could still move, still write and work and smile, but each motion felt slower, not effortless anymore, as if something unseen was slowing me down. When I looked down, the backs of my hands no longer looked entirely human. The texture had deepened, faint lines running across the surface like thin rivers beneath translucent bark. When I pressed my thumb into the skin, it didn’t yield - it only gave a dull, hollow sound, like tapping on wood.

I told myself it was nothing serious, that my mind was tired, that people see what they fear. But when I spoke, the words came slower. My voice carried a faint echo, as though it traveled through a hollow space before reaching the air. The sound startled me — familiar, but not mine. Like hearing someone speak through my throat. Each sound seemed to come from a little farther away than it should have.

At the office, I began to drift toward the edges of conversations. I laughed when others laughed, but the sound left my mouth flat and unfamiliar. Words that once came easily now felt heavy, caught somewhere between thought and air. No one said anything, yet I could sense it - the faint shift in how they looked at me, polite, careful, as though I were a fragile object best not disturbed.

That evening, I sat in front of the mirror again. The reflection waited for me patiently. The change was no longer subtle: my forearms were pale and smooth, the veins beneath replaced by faint wooden grain. When I moved, a soft creak followed, delicate but distinct. My skin didn’t stretch anymore - it flexed. I watched the motion repeat, fascinated and horrified at once.

Outside, the city blurred. The light through the window seemed to move slower, the air thicker. I lifted my hand and traced the edge of my reflection, fingertips against cool glass. For a moment, it felt like the mirror was the only thing keeping me from vanishing altogether.

I stayed like that for a long time - half flesh, half wood - unsure which part was fading and which one was finally waking.

 

**Chapter 4**

I stood before the mirror for a long time. The figure that stared back no longer felt like a reflection, but a carving left behind by someone who had already gone. My skin had hardened fully - pale, smooth, the faint patterns of wood grain spiraling across my arms and neck. The last warmth of flesh lingered only at the corners of my mouth, in the faint twitch of movement when I tried to smile. My eyes, though, were the same. Still human. Still afraid. I tried to remember the warmth of another’s touch — skin on skin, not this polished silence — but the memory splintered before it reached me.

I tried to breathe deeply, but even air moved differently now. It entered my chest with a dry rasp, passing through ribs that felt less like bone and more like hollow branches. When I placed my hand over my heart, I felt no pulse - only the faint vibration of air moving through the spaces inside me. The silence in the room pressed against my ears, and beneath it, I could almost hear the slow expansion of the wooden roots, settling deeper, claiming what was still left.

There was no pain anymore, just stillness. And in that stillness, an odd calm. I had stopped fighting the change days ago. What would be the point? The more I resisted, the tighter it held. I told myself it wasn’t fear I felt - fear belonged to living things. What remained was something quieter, like acceptance mistaken for peace.

My hands moved almost on their own, opening a drawer I hadn’t touched in years. Inside lay a small box, filled with metal hooks and tangled ropes. I didn’t remember putting them there, yet they felt familiar, inevitable. The sound of metal against metal was soft, almost kind. The ropes seemed to shift slightly in the drawer, as if they had been waiting for this moment longer than I had.

I picked up one of the hooks, turning it in my wooden fingers. It caught the light, sharp and still. Then, carefully, I pressed it into my palm. No pain - just contact, the sound of pressure against wood. One by one, I placed them: palms, wrists, ankles. Each twist felt both wrong and necessary, each clink of metal against wood steadying me.

When the ropes came next, they slid easily through my hands. I looped them, tied them, and tested their pull. Each knot held with perfect precision. The air in the room grew still, waiting.

“I don’t want to steer my life anymore,” I whispered. My voice sounded carved, hollow, not my own. The ropes trembled - once, twice - then lifted.

They pulled gently at first, guiding my arms, my head, my body. My posture straightened; my movements smoothed. And as I looked into the mirror again, a small smile curved across my wooden face.  
I didn’t know if it belonged to me—or to the ropes.

For a while, it was easier this way.

 

**Chapter 5**

At first, the ropes felt like mercy.  
Each movement flowed so easily, as though the air itself carried me forward. My hands no longer hesitated; they knew what to do before I did. The tension that had once coiled in my chest loosened. I moved without thought, without doubt, without the quiet ache of decision.  
Days blurred into one another, soft and golden. The city seemed to open itself to me - streets brighter, voices friendlier, work effortless. Every task unfolded with perfect rhythm; I didn’t have to think, and that felt like freedom. The ropes were gentle, precise, almost tender. They moved like a dance I had always known, pulling light through me in perfect time, until even my thoughts swayed to their rhythm. They knew how to make life smooth, how to quiet every noise inside me.

People smiled more. I laughed more. I said the right things, did the right things, and the world responded in kind. For the first time, I felt... right. Balanced. Complete. The weight I’d carried for so long had lifted, and in its place was something light, almost divine.  
I began to crave that lightness. I wanted to stay inside it forever - the sweet ease of surrender, the way the ropes guided every step before I could stumble. I didn’t need to think, didn’t need to want. Everything that hurt had dissolved into motion, rhythm, and control that wasn’t mine but felt better than mine ever had.

It was intoxicating, the way peace replaced the pulse of thought. The ropes tugged softly, and I followed without question. I told myself this was what being alive was meant to feel like: painless, seamless, perfectly aligned.  
And in a way, it was.  
For a while.

 

**Chapter 6**

The ropes no longer whispered; they pulled. Hard. Insistent. Relentless. The sound they made was new - a strained, grinding noise, like wood splintering under pressure.  
Every tug left a sting, every twist left a bruise I hadn’t noticed at first. What had felt like freedom became a subtle torture. I tried to move with them, but the ropes had their own rhythm now - jerky, unpredictable, demanding. I stumbled. I fell. The city’s golden light turned cold, the laughter hollow.  
I couldn’t hear my own thoughts anymore. They were swallowed by the ropes’ endless tugging, a mechanical echo that bounced back at me louder than any voice I had ever known. Each pull was a craving, each loop a trap. I reached for balance, for the lightness I’d loved, but the ropes yanked me down before I could grasp it.

And still I followed. I told myself it was guidance, discipline, care - but it was control. My hands were no longer my own; my movements belonged to something else. The world outside dulled, shrank, while the ropes’ voice - shrill, seductive, and insistent - grew louder, an endless whisper I couldn’t ignore.

Every tug demanded more, needed more. My chest ached. My stomach twisted. Nights bled into mornings, mornings into haze. I was exhausted, yet I craved the ropes’ next pull as though it were the only way to feel alive. And in that craving, I felt the first real terror: the ropes were not gentle. They were not kind. They were addiction made flesh, pulling me apart with every graceful, terrifying tug.

 

**Chapter 7**

It happened quietly - no grand revelation, no scream. Just a breath, shaky and thin, that wasn’t guided by anything outside myself. For the first time in what felt like years, I moved on my own. It was clumsy, trembling, almost unbearable.

I searched with my hands, fumbling through the tangle, desperate and shaking, until my fingers closed around something cold and sharp. Scissors. I held them, feeling their weight, the simple promise of choice.

I lifted my arm. The first rope was tight, stubborn, almost like it didn’t want to be killed, but one careful snip and it was gone. In the mirror, I watched the fibers tremble as I cut - not red, not blood, but pale dust falling from the wound. And then another rope, another cut. And another. Cut. With each cut, the tension I had carried slowly unraveled, and yet, it didn’t leave me empty - it left me light. Free in a way I hadn’t remembered.  
The quiet that followed was soft and strange, like the first breath of air after being underwater too long. My hands relaxed. My shoulders, tight for years, loosened. I stayed in that calm, letting it wash over me, feeling the relief without fear, the ease without weight.  
My breath came uneven, rough, but real. The air tasted sharp - like rain hitting metal. For the first time in a long while, I understood what it meant to hold nothing - and how good it could feel.

 

**Chapter 8**

The days had settled into a rhythm, gentle but deliberate. I moved through mornings with the quiet attention of someone learning to walk on unfamiliar ground. Coffee steamed in my hands, the streets hummed softly around me, and I noticed the small details: a leaf stuck to a bicycle tire, the way sunlight caught on windowpanes, the distant chatter of neighbors.

Thoughts came and went like clouds, sometimes heavy, sometimes fleeting, but I met each one with patience. I carried on - meals, reading, walking without haste - finding comfort in the ordinary, in the ordinary acts that once felt impossible. The world didn’t change overnight, but I felt the edges of it soften, and felt my own edges soften with it.

And now, I sat on a park bench, the afternoon sun warming my back. I let out a long sigh and looked down at my hands. They were still a little wooden, stiff in the joints, but that was okay. Everyone **is** a little wooden sometimes, and somehow that made it easier to simply be me.

That kid? That was me. Majors Drive was my home turf, at the end of the street right near Bruton Park and not far from the Mesquite Rodeo. I was white, middle class, and far from rich, but on my Suzuki 80, then my 125 Trail, I felt like I owned the entire town.

From Kleberg Road on the south edge of town to the just-built Town East Mall and beyond, I terrorized Mesquite - or at least, that’s how it felt in my head. Kleberg was nothing but farms, gravel, and endless open stretches. Perfect for throttle therapy. I’d ride all the way to the mall, sometimes stopping for arcade tokens or a slice at Sbarro, then rocket back like the wind.

The cops knew me. Not the “book him” kind of known, but the kind where they knew my house, knew my schedule, and sometimes just waited at the end of Majors Drive, sipping coffee, hoping I’d come home so they could give me a scolding look. And if I wanted to, I’d ride right past them - Bruton Park was mine. I had jumps, berms, and creek crossings that turned any park visitor and the local neighbors into unwilling spectators.

**The Legend of Bruton Park**

Bruton Park wasn’t just a park. It was my proving ground. Dirt berms, jumps, low spots in Mesquite Creek - me and sometimes my friends built it all. Every lap, every roar of the engine, turned picnickers, the local neighbors and unleashed dogs into unwilling spectators, the sound echoing off the trees. This was my domain.

My first track was modest: a few jumps, a start line built from scrap wood, and a clear path through the field right next to the house. Later, I expanded it - longer runs, bigger jumps, more dust all the way around the lake. And yes, I had Slurpees fueling my rides. Cherry-Coke swirl, brain-freezing perfection. The 7-Eleven on Galloway was my pit stop.

**The Councilwoman’s Wrath**

Brunhilde Nystrom lived just down the street from me at 1213 Majors Drive. Next to her house was a field also with a track my friends and I had built. Brunhilde, the first woman on the Mesquite City Council, elected in ‘72, was a pioneer and a terror to teenage rebels like me. From her kitchen window, she saw every chaotic lap.

Her solution? She passed an ordinance: “It shall be unlawful for any person to operate or drive a motor vehicle in and upon all public parks… except on paved roadways and parking areas specifically designed for motor vehicle traffic.”

Still today, when you go into any city park in Mesquite, you'll see the signs—“Motorized Vehicles Restricted To Paved Roads And Parking.”

In “my” park—Bruton Park, right next to my childhood home - the sign went up, right there in the middle of my trail.

**The Bruton Park Heist**

What do you do when the law plants a sign on your track? You dig it up. I yanked that sign out of the ground and threw it into City Lake before the concrete was even dry. Rusting somewhere under the water, it remains a silent testament to my teenage audacity. The cops knew. Nystrom knew. But I didn’t care. The next day, I was back in the park, throttle wide open, rooster-tailing mud and chaos across the field.

**Nights of Mayhem**

Evenings were prime time. The light dipping behind the rooftops of Mesquite, the streets emptying, fields glowing orange in the sunset - I would take my Suzuki 125 Trail out for runs that stretched all the way from Kleberg to Town East Mall. No plates. No insurance. No helmets. Pure, unbridled freedom. I dodged subdivisions, jumped creek beds, and carved lines into the grass that could still be traced in imagination if you knew where to look.

**The Forbidden Field**

The empty lot next to Nystrom’s house? That was the Forbidden Zone. My friends and I built jumps, whoops, and a crude start gate out of scrap wood. From her kitchen, she would hear our engines screaming through the air. I’d wave as I passed her mailbox - or honk the horn for dramatic effect. She hated me. And honestly, I loved it. It was the perfect suburban clash: my jumps; her ordinances, my rebellion.

**The Slurpee Economy**

Fuel for my empire wasn’t gas alone - it was Slurpees. Cherry + Coke swirl. Brain freeze guaranteed. One Slurpee = one hour of throttle therapy. I’d ride to 7-Eleven, helmet strapped, dripping sweat and gasoline, hand the clerk my currency, and keep going. They didn’t care. I was a regular. I was a legend.

**The Bikes**

Suzuki 80: Lightweight, screamy, perfect for hopping berms and running my first small tracks.

Suzuki 125 Trail: Taller, torquier, built for the Kleberg-to-Mall death runs. This was peak legend—a two-stroke symphony of power and chaos.

**The Legacy**

Fast forward to today, and Mesquite still carries the echoes of my reign. Every faded city park sign reading “Motor Vehicles Restricted To Paved Roads and Parking” whispers my name. They weren’t just laws - they were my fingerprints on the city.

I didn’t just ride. I didn’t just play. I redefined suburban teenage rebellion. I left scars on Bruton Park, tracks on the field next to Nystrom’s house, and in the hearts of anyone who saw a kid flying through the dirt with no fear of authority.

The Bruton Park Heist, the Kleberg runs, the Slurpee stops, the forbidden field - this is all me. Majors Drive may be quiet now, but if you ride past at dusk, you can still hear the faint roar of a Suzuki 125, slicing through time and memory.

I wasn’t just a kid on a dirt bike. I was the original Dirt Bike Bandit of Mesquite.

And every time someone reads the park sign and wonders why it’s there… that’s me, laughing somewhere behind the trees, Slurpee in hand.

I began to crave that lightness. I wanted to stay inside it forever - the sweet ease of surrender, the way the ropes guided every step before I could stumble. I didn’t need to think, didn’t need to want. Everything that hurt had dissolved into motion, rhythm, and control that wasn’t mine but felt better than mine ever had.

It was intoxicating, the way peace replaced the pulse of thought. The ropes tugged softly, and I followed without question. I told myself this was what being alive was meant to feel like: painless, seamless, perfectly aligned.  
And in a way, it was.  
For a while.

 

**Chapter 6**

The ropes no longer whispered; they pulled. Hard. Insistent. Relentless. The sound they made was new - a strained, grinding noise, like wood splintering under pressure.  
Every tug left a sting, every twist left a bruise I hadn’t noticed at first. What had felt like freedom became a subtle torture. I tried to move with them, but the ropes had their own rhythm now - jerky, unpredictable, demanding. I stumbled. I fell. The city’s golden light turned cold, the laughter hollow.  
I couldn’t hear my own thoughts anymore. They were swallowed by the ropes’ endless tugging, a mechanical echo that bounced back at me louder than any voice I had ever known. Each pull was a craving, each loop a trap. I reached for balance, for the lightness I’d loved, but the ropes yanked me down before I could grasp it.

And still I followed. I told myself it was guidance, discipline, care - but it was control. My hands were no longer my own; my movements belonged to something else. The world outside dulled, shrank, while the ropes’ voice - shrill, seductive, and insistent - grew louder, an endless whisper I couldn’t ignore.

Every tug demanded more, needed more. My chest ached. My stomach twisted. Nights bled into mornings, mornings into haze. I was exhausted, yet I craved the ropes’ next pull as though it were the only way to feel alive. And in that craving, I felt the first real terror: the ropes were not gentle. They were not kind. They were addiction made flesh, pulling me apart with every graceful, terrifying tug.

 

**Chapter 7**

It happened quietly - no grand revelation, no scream. Just a breath, shaky and thin, that wasn’t guided by anything outside myself. For the first time in what felt like years, I moved on my own. It was clumsy, trembling, almost unbearable.

I searched with my hands, fumbling through the tangle, desperate and shaking, until my fingers closed around something cold and sharp. Scissors. I held them, feeling their weight, the simple promise of choice.

I lifted my arm. The first rope was tight, stubborn, almost like it didn’t want to be killed, but one careful snip and it was gone. In the mirror, I watched the fibers tremble as I cut - not red, not blood, but pale dust falling from the wound. And then another rope, another cut. And another. Cut. With each cut, the tension I had carried slowly unraveled, and yet, it didn’t leave me empty - it left me light. Free in a way I hadn’t remembered.  
The quiet that followed was soft and strange, like the first breath of air after being underwater too long. My hands relaxed. My shoulders, tight for years, loosened. I stayed in that calm, letting it wash over me, feeling the relief without fear, the ease without weight.  
My breath came uneven, rough, but real. The air tasted sharp - like rain hitting metal. For the first time in a long while, I understood what it meant to hold nothing - and how good it could feel.

 

**Chapter 8**

The days had settled into a rhythm, gentle but deliberate. I moved through mornings with the quiet attention of someone learning to walk on unfamiliar ground. Coffee steamed in my hands, the streets hummed softly around me, and I noticed the small details: a leaf stuck to a bicycle tire, the way sunlight caught on windowpanes, the distant chatter of neighbors.

Thoughts came and went like clouds, sometimes heavy, sometimes fleeting, but I met each one with patience. I carried on - meals, reading, walking without haste - finding comfort in the ordinary, in the ordinary acts that once felt impossible. The world didn’t change overnight, but I felt the edges of it soften, and felt my own edges soften with it.

And now, I sat on a park bench, the afternoon sun warming my back. I let out a long sigh and looked down at my hands. They were still a little wooden, stiff in the joints, but that was okay. Everyone **is** a little wooden sometimes, and somehow that made it easier to simply be me.

I walked slowly through the quiet streets, sunlight spilling through the trees like honey, dripping gold across the pavement. The air felt light against my skin, scented faintly with flowers I couldn’t see, only sense - like a whispered promise. Children’s laughter drifted somewhere distant, thin and strange, like it belonged to a world just slightly out of reach. My steps matched the rhythm of that hidden song. I didn’t need to hurry anywhere. For once, no one was asking for more than I could give. I let the day move around me, gentle and bright, the kind of light that asks for nothing in return.

At work, things carried the same quiet ease. Conversations slipped by without tension, smiles fit naturally, and the small rituals of my day - emails, meetings, coffee cooling on the desk - formed a soft pattern of calm. I watched the world, not as someone apart from it, but as if I were part of its natural rhythm. For the first time in a long while, the silence inside me didn’t echo - it hummed.

When I came home, I tossed my bag by the door and breathed out. The sunlight through the curtains painted amber shapes on the wooden floorboards, and the air smelled faintly of pine and warmth. For a moment, I simply leaned there, letting the quiet hold me in its arms. Then, as I stretched my fingers, I felt something - barely noticeable - a faint stiffness in my knuckles, as though the joints remembered something the rest of me had forgotten. When the light hit my hand, I thought I saw it: a faint pattern beneath the skin, thin and irregular, like the grain of wood just below the surface. I blinked, and it was gone.  
I flexed again, smiled a little, and whispered, “Everyone’s a little wooden sometimes.”

 

**Chapter 2**

The next morning, the city felt different. The streets seemed narrower, the light sharper, as if the world had been slightly rearranged while I slept. Shadows reached farther across the pavement, and the air carried the scent of last night’s rain - fresh, cool, but heavy somehow, like it was holding a secret. I couldn’t name what had changed, only that something must’ve.

When I washed my hands before leaving for work, I noticed the texture of my skin. It caught the light strangely, too smooth, too even, as if the pores had been filled with something fine and pale. I ran my thumb across my palm - it felt dry, almost polished. When I held my hand to the light, faint ridges caught the glow, running in uneven lines. Like the faint beginnings of grain. I told myself it was nothing. The air had been dry lately. I dressed and went out.

At work, the rhythm faltered. Small things slipped - a wrong attachment in an email, a word misplaced, a hesitation that hadn’t been there before. No one noticed, or if they did, they smiled too quickly, too politely. I laughed when expected, nodded in the right places, but a faint tension pressed against the edges of everything, like a note played slightly out of tune.

By midday, my fingers ached. It wasn’t pain, not exactly - just a quiet resistance, as though something inside the joints was stiffening, settling into shape. When I turned my wrist, the light caught faintly along the grain - no, not grain, I thought. Skin doesn’t have grain. I flexed again, trying to ignore it.

When I got home, I leaned against the counter and stretched my fingers again. The stiffness was still there, faint but undeniable. The surface of my knuckles glimmered in the late sunlight, soft but unnatural, like varnish beginning to dry. Somewhere inside the walls, wood creaked softly — a slow, stretching sound that matched the rhythm of my breath. I smiled, forcing lightness into my voice.  
“Everyone’s a little wooden sometimes,” I said again, though it sounded reassuring this time.

 

**Chapter 3**

By midweek, the stiffness had become part of me. I could still move, still write and work and smile, but each motion felt slower, not effortless anymore, as if something unseen was slowing me down. When I looked down, the backs of my hands no longer looked entirely human. The texture had deepened, faint lines running across the surface like thin rivers beneath translucent bark. When I pressed my thumb into the skin, it didn’t yield - it only gave a dull, hollow sound, like tapping on wood.

I told myself it was nothing serious, that my mind was tired, that people see what they fear. But when I spoke, the words came slower. My voice carried a faint echo, as though it traveled through a hollow space before reaching the air. The sound startled me — familiar, but not mine. Like hearing someone speak through my throat. Each sound seemed to come from a little farther away than it should have.

At the office, I began to drift toward the edges of conversations. I laughed when others laughed, but the sound left my mouth flat and unfamiliar. Words that once came easily now felt heavy, caught somewhere between thought and air. No one said anything, yet I could sense it - the faint shift in how they looked at me, polite, careful, as though I were a fragile object best not disturbed.

That evening, I sat in front of the mirror again. The reflection waited for me patiently. The change was no longer subtle: my forearms were pale and smooth, the veins beneath replaced by faint wooden grain. When I moved, a soft creak followed, delicate but distinct. My skin didn’t stretch anymore - it flexed. I watched the motion repeat, fascinated and horrified at once.

Outside, the city blurred. The light through the window seemed to move slower, the air thicker. I lifted my hand and traced the edge of my reflection, fingertips against cool glass. For a moment, it felt like the mirror was the only thing keeping me from vanishing altogether.

I stayed like that for a long time - half flesh, half wood - unsure which part was fading and which one was finally waking.

 

**Chapter 4**

I stood before the mirror for a long time. The figure that stared back no longer felt like a reflection, but a carving left behind by someone who had already gone. My skin had hardened fully - pale, smooth, the faint patterns of wood grain spiraling across my arms and neck. The last warmth of flesh lingered only at the corners of my mouth, in the faint twitch of movement when I tried to smile. My eyes, though, were the same. Still human. Still afraid. I tried to remember the warmth of another’s touch — skin on skin, not this polished silence — but the memory splintered before it reached me.

I tried to breathe deeply, but even air moved differently now. It entered my chest with a dry rasp, passing through ribs that felt less like bone and more like hollow branches. When I placed my hand over my heart, I felt no pulse - only the faint vibration of air moving through the spaces inside me. The silence in the room pressed against my ears, and beneath it, I could almost hear the slow expansion of the wooden roots, settling deeper, claiming what was still left.

There was no pain anymore, just stillness. And in that stillness, an odd calm. I had stopped fighting the change days ago. What would be the point? The more I resisted, the tighter it held. I told myself it wasn’t fear I felt - fear belonged to living things. What remained was something quieter, like acceptance mistaken for peace.

My hands moved almost on their own, opening a drawer I hadn’t touched in years. Inside lay a small box, filled with metal hooks and tangled ropes. I didn’t remember putting them there, yet they felt familiar, inevitable. The sound of metal against metal was soft, almost kind. The ropes seemed to shift slightly in the drawer, as if they had been waiting for this moment longer than I had.

I picked up one of the hooks, turning it in my wooden fingers. It caught the light, sharp and still. Then, carefully, I pressed it into my palm. No pain - just contact, the sound of pressure against wood. One by one, I placed them: palms, wrists, ankles. Each twist felt both wrong and necessary, each clink of metal against wood steadying me.

When the ropes came next, they slid easily through my hands. I looped them, tied them, and tested their pull. Each knot held with perfect precision. The air in the room grew still, waiting.

“I don’t want to steer my life anymore,” I whispered. My voice sounded carved, hollow, not my own. The ropes trembled - once, twice - then lifted.

They pulled gently at first, guiding my arms, my head, my body. My posture straightened; my movements smoothed. And as I looked into the mirror again, a small smile curved across my wooden face.  
I didn’t know if it belonged to me—or to the ropes.

For a while, it was easier this way.

 

**Chapter 5**

At first, the ropes felt like mercy.  
Each movement flowed so easily, as though the air itself carried me forward. My hands no longer hesitated; they knew what to do before I did. The tension that had once coiled in my chest loosened. I moved without thought, without doubt, without the quiet ache of decision.  
Days blurred into one another, soft and golden. The city seemed to open itself to me - streets brighter, voices friendlier, work effortless. Every task unfolded with perfect rhythm; I didn’t have to think, and that felt like freedom. The ropes were gentle, precise, almost tender. They moved like a dance I had always known, pulling light through me in perfect time, until even my thoughts swayed to their rhythm. They knew how to make life smooth, how to quiet every noise inside me.

People smiled more. I laughed more. I said the right things, did the right things, and the world responded in kind. For the first time, I felt... right. Balanced. Complete. The weight I’d carried for so long had lifted, and in its place was something light, almost divine.  
I began to crave that lightness. I wanted to stay inside it forever - the sweet ease of surrender, the way the ropes guided every step before I could stumble. I didn’t need to think, didn’t need to want. Everything that hurt had dissolved into motion, rhythm, and control that wasn’t mine but felt better than mine ever had.

It was intoxicating, the way peace replaced the pulse of thought. The ropes tugged softly, and I followed without question. I told myself this was what being alive was meant to feel like: painless, seamless, perfectly aligned.

If you ask my opinion, I’d like to play as Brighde Halvorstadir in Galmland DLC. A socialist country in CSP, struggling to find its way with “Galmish Manifesto” while exploring Chancellor Hegel’s ulterior motives and his dark side. Hegel doesn’t support her in this way and insists that Valgslandian Socialism is the best way to achieve the goal. But Halvorstadir is adamant about the manifesto, still believes that it will strengthen the sovereignty of Galmland inside CSP. So Hegel starts to pressurize her from the inside and outside. Somehow, Galmish intelligence agency learns about a Valgish man who has been shot down for burning Agnolian flag in Heljiland is actually a Valgslandian agent. It seems that Hegel sent him to incite violence and create an excuse for the invasion, but things didn’t go as planned, and he was killed. Nevertheless, Hegel was convinced that it’s time to intervene and asks CSP’s political and economic support in the summit, but Halvorstadir objects to the idea, during the coffee break she threatens Hegel with this intelligence and uses it as a bargaining chip for “Galmish Manifesto”. Hegel agrees that he will not pressurize Galmland anymore in exchange of destroying the intelligence(Alvarez moment). After that, Halvorstadir agrees to support Valgsland in the invasion.

I walked slowly through the quiet streets, sunlight spilling through the trees like honey, dripping gold across the pavement. The air felt light against my skin, scented faintly with flowers I couldn’t see, only sense - like a whispered promise. Children’s laughter drifted somewhere distant, thin and strange, like it belonged to a world just slightly out of reach. My steps matched the rhythm of that hidden song. I didn’t need to hurry anywhere. For once, no one was asking for more than I could give. I let the day move around me, gentle and bright, the kind of light that asks for nothing in return.

At work, things carried the same quiet ease. Conversations slipped by without tension, smiles fit naturally, and the small rituals of my day - emails, meetings, coffee cooling on the desk - formed a soft pattern of calm. I watched the world, not as someone apart from it, but as if I were part of its natural rhythm. For the first time in a long while, the silence inside me didn’t echo - it hummed.

When I came home, I tossed my bag by the door and breathed out. The sunlight through the curtains painted amber shapes on the wooden floorboards, and the air smelled faintly of pine and warmth. For a moment, I simply leaned there, letting the quiet hold me in its arms. Then, as I stretched my fingers, I felt something - barely noticeable - a faint stiffness in my knuckles, as though the joints remembered something the rest of me had forgotten. When the light hit my hand, I thought I saw it: a faint pattern beneath the skin, thin and irregular, like the grain of wood just below the surface. I blinked, and it was gone.  
I flexed again, smiled a little, and whispered, “Everyone’s a little wooden sometimes.”

 

**Chapter 2**

The next morning, the city felt different. The streets seemed narrower, the light sharper, as if the world had been slightly rearranged while I slept. Shadows reached farther across the pavement, and the air carried the scent of last night’s rain - fresh, cool, but heavy somehow, like it was holding a secret. I couldn’t name what had changed, only that something must’ve.

When I washed my hands before leaving for work, I noticed the texture of my skin. It caught the light strangely, too smooth, too even, as if the pores had been filled with something fine and pale. I ran my thumb across my palm - it felt dry, almost polished. When I held my hand to the light, faint ridges caught the glow, running in uneven lines. Like the faint beginnings of grain. I told myself it was nothing. The air had been dry lately. I dressed and went out.

At work, the rhythm faltered. Small things slipped - a wrong attachment in an email, a word misplaced, a hesitation that hadn’t been there before. No one noticed, or if they did, they smiled too quickly, too politely. I laughed when expected, nodded in the right places, but a faint tension pressed against the edges of everything, like a note played slightly out of tune.

By midday, my fingers ached. It wasn’t pain, not exactly - just a quiet resistance, as though something inside the joints was stiffening, settling into shape. When I turned my wrist, the light caught faintly along the grain - no, not grain, I thought. Skin doesn’t have grain. I flexed again, trying to ignore it.

When I got home, I leaned against the counter and stretched my fingers again. The stiffness was still there, faint but undeniable. The surface of my knuckles glimmered in the late sunlight, soft but unnatural, like varnish beginning to dry. Somewhere inside the walls, wood creaked softly — a slow, stretching sound that matched the rhythm of my breath. I smiled, forcing lightness into my voice.  
“Everyone’s a little wooden sometimes,” I said again, though it sounded reassuring this time.

 

**Chapter 3**

By midweek, the stiffness had become part of me. I could still move, still write and work and smile, but each motion felt slower, not effortless anymore, as if something unseen was slowing me down. When I looked down, the backs of my hands no longer looked entirely human. The texture had deepened, faint lines running across the surface like thin rivers beneath translucent bark. When I pressed my thumb into the skin, it didn’t yield - it only gave a dull, hollow sound, like tapping on wood.

I told myself it was nothing serious, that my mind was tired, that people see what they fear. But when I spoke, the words came slower. My voice carried a faint echo, as though it traveled through a hollow space before reaching the air. The sound startled me — familiar, but not mine. Like hearing someone speak through my throat. Each sound seemed to come from a little farther away than it should have.

At the office, I began to drift toward the edges of conversations. I laughed when others laughed, but the sound left my mouth flat and unfamiliar. Words that once came easily now felt heavy, caught somewhere between thought and air. No one said anything, yet I could sense it - the faint shift in how they looked at me, polite, careful, as though I were a fragile object best not disturbed.

That evening, I sat in front of the mirror again. The reflection waited for me patiently. The change was no longer subtle: my forearms were pale and smooth, the veins beneath replaced by faint wooden grain. When I moved, a soft creak followed, delicate but distinct. My skin didn’t stretch anymore - it flexed. I watched the motion repeat, fascinated and horrified at once.

Outside, the city blurred. The light through the window seemed to move slower, the air thicker. I lifted my hand and traced the edge of my reflection, fingertips against cool glass. For a moment, it felt like the mirror was the only thing keeping me from vanishing altogether.

I stayed like that for a long time - half flesh, half wood - unsure which part was fading and which one was finally waking.

 

**Chapter 4**

I stood before the mirror for a long time. The figure that stared back no longer felt like a reflection, but a carving left behind by someone who had already gone. My skin had hardened fully - pale, smooth, the faint patterns of wood grain spiraling across my arms and neck. The last warmth of flesh lingered only at the corners of my mouth, in the faint twitch of movement when I tried to smile. My eyes, though, were the same. Still human. Still afraid. I tried to remember the warmth of another’s touch — skin on skin, not this polished silence — but the memory splintered before it reached me.

I tried to breathe deeply, but even air moved differently now. It entered my chest with a dry rasp, passing through ribs that felt less like bone and more like hollow branches. When I placed my hand over my heart, I felt no pulse - only the faint vibration of air moving through the spaces inside me. The silence in the room pressed against my ears, and beneath it, I could almost hear the slow expansion of the wooden roots, settling deeper, claiming what was still left.

There was no pain anymore, just stillness. And in that stillness, an odd calm. I had stopped fighting the change days ago. What would be the point? The more I resisted, the tighter it held. I told myself it wasn’t fear I felt - fear belonged to living things. What remained was something quieter, like acceptance mistaken for peace.

My hands moved almost on their own, opening a drawer I hadn’t touched in years. Inside lay a small box, filled with metal hooks and tangled ropes. I didn’t remember putting them there, yet they felt familiar, inevitable. The sound of metal against metal was soft, almost kind. The ropes seemed to shift slightly in the drawer, as if they had been waiting for this moment longer than I had.

I picked up one of the hooks, turning it in my wooden fingers. It caught the light, sharp and still. Then, carefully, I pressed it into my palm. No pain - just contact, the sound of pressure against wood. One by one, I placed them: palms, wrists, ankles. Each twist felt both wrong and necessary, each clink of metal against wood steadying me.

When the ropes came next, they slid easily through my hands. I looped them, tied them, and tested their pull. Each knot held with perfect precision. The air in the room grew still, waiting.

“I don’t want to steer my life anymore,” I whispered. My voice sounded carved, hollow, not my own. The ropes trembled - once, twice - then lifted.

They pulled gently at first, guiding my arms, my head, my body. My posture straightened; my movements smoothed. And as I looked into the mirror again, a small smile curved across my wooden face.  
I didn’t know if it belonged to me—or to the ropes.

For a while, it was easier this way.

 

**Chapter 5**

At first, the ropes felt like mercy.  
Each movement flowed so easily, as though the air itself carried me forward. My hands no longer hesitated; they knew what to do before I did. The tension that had once coiled in my chest loosened. I moved without thought, without doubt, without the quiet ache of decision.  
Days blurred into one another, soft and golden. The city seemed to open itself to me - streets brighter, voices friendlier, work effortless. Every task unfolded with perfect rhythm; I didn’t have to think, and that felt like freedom. The ropes were gentle, precise, almost tender. They moved like a dance I had always known, pulling light through me in perfect time, until even my thoughts swayed to their rhythm. They knew how to make life smooth, how to quiet every noise inside me.

People smiled more. I laughed more. I said the right things, did the right things, and the world responded in kind. For the first time, I felt... right. Balanced. Complete. The weight I’d carried for so long had lifted, and in its place was something light, almost divine.  
I began to crave that lightness. I wanted to stay inside it forever - the sweet ease of surrender, the way the ropes guided every step before I could stumble. I didn’t need to think, didn’t need to want. Everything that hurt had dissolved into motion, rhythm, and control that wasn’t mine but felt better than mine ever had.

It was intoxicating, the way peace replaced the pulse of thought. The ropes tugged softly, and I followed without question. I told myself this was what being alive was meant to feel like: painless, seamless, perfectly aligned.  
And in a way, it was.  
For a while.

 

**Chapter 6**

The ropes no longer whispered; they pulled. Hard. Insistent. Relentless. The sound they made was new - a strained, grinding noise, like wood splintering under pressure.  
Every tug left a sting, every twist left a bruise I hadn’t noticed at first. What had felt like freedom became a subtle torture. I tried to move with them, but the ropes had their own rhythm now - jerky, unpredictable, demanding. I stumbled. I fell. The city’s golden light turned cold, the laughter hollow.  
I couldn’t hear my own thoughts anymore. They were swallowed by the ropes’ endless tugging, a mechanical echo that bounced back at me louder than any voice I had ever known. Each pull was a craving, each loop a trap. I reached for balance, for the lightness I’d loved, but the ropes yanked me down before I could grasp it.

And still I followed. I told myself it was guidance, discipline, care - but it was control. My hands were no longer my own; my movements belonged to something else. The world outside dulled, shrank, while the ropes’ voice - shrill, seductive, and insistent - grew louder, an endless whisper I couldn’t ignore.

Every tug demanded more, needed more. My chest ached. My stomach twisted. Nights bled into mornings, mornings into haze. I was exhausted, yet I craved the ropes’ next pull as though it were the only way to feel alive. And in that craving, I felt the first real terror: the ropes were not gentle. They were not kind. They were addiction made flesh, pulling me apart with every graceful, terrifying tug.

 

**Chapter 7**

It happened quietly - no grand revelation, no scream. Just a breath, shaky and thin, that wasn’t guided by anything outside myself. For the first time in what felt like years, I moved on my own. It was clumsy, trembling, almost unbearable.

I searched with my hands, fumbling through the tangle, desperate and shaking, until my fingers closed around something cold and sharp. Scissors. I held them, feeling their weight, the simple promise of choice.

I lifted my arm. The first rope was tight, stubborn, almost like it didn’t want to be killed, but one careful snip and it was gone. In the mirror, I watched the fibers tremble as I cut - not red, not blood, but pale dust falling from the wound. And then another rope, another cut. And another. Cut. With each cut, the tension I had carried slowly unraveled, and yet, it didn’t leave me empty - it left me light. Free in a way I hadn’t remembered.  
The quiet that followed was soft and strange, like the first breath of air after being underwater too long. My hands relaxed. My shoulders, tight for years, loosened. I stayed in that calm, letting it wash over me, feeling the relief without fear, the ease without weight.  
My breath came uneven, rough, but real. The air tasted sharp - like rain hitting metal. For the first time in a long while, I understood what it meant to hold nothing - and how good it could feel.

 

**Chapter 8**

The days had settled into a rhythm, gentle but deliberate. I moved through mornings with the quiet attention of someone learning to walk on unfamiliar ground. Coffee steamed in my hands, the streets hummed softly around me, and I noticed the small details: a leaf stuck to a bicycle tire, the way sunlight caught on windowpanes, the distant chatter of neighbors.

Thoughts came and went like clouds, sometimes heavy, sometimes fleeting, but I met each one with patience. I carried on - meals, reading, walking without haste - finding comfort in the ordinary, in the ordinary acts that once felt impossible. The world didn’t change overnight, but I felt the edges of it soften, and felt my own edges soften with it.

And now, I sat on a park bench, the afternoon sun warming my back. I let out a long sigh and looked down at my hands. They were still a little wooden, stiff in the joints, but that was okay. Everyone **is** a little wooden sometimes, and somehow that made it easier to simply be me.

i dropped out of high school at 16 because the thought of sitting in a room full of humans was so physically repulsive that my body literally staged a coup against my brain. never went back. no job, no school, no ambitions, just a highly curated playlist of slowed-down video game soundtracks, a vape pen, and the desperate hope that my phone battery doesn't die before i do. sometimes i pretend i’m the failed secret route in a visual novel, the one you only unlock if you pick all the worst options and then forget to save.

my self-care routine is “wait until my hair starts matting, then consider dry shampoo and decide it’s too much work.” i am the final boss of social anxiety, a cryptid that feeds exclusively on instant noodles, iced coffee, and the crumbs of my own dignity. my room is a biohazard zone, my bedsheets are an archaeological dig site, and i have fused with my ancient decrepit sweaters like some kind of reverse werewolf.

i do not have friends, unless you count the anime figures on my bookshelf that i talk to at 4am, or the neighbor’s cat who stares at me through the window like he’s seen a ghost. i am not looking for romance, not even a little bit. i am so beyond romance-pilled that i don’t even want a hug, just someone to send me weird youtube links and say “did you brush your teeth” without making it weird.

what i’m searching for:

* an older masculine mentor/internet dad/uncle/cryptid handler
* must enjoy dealing with tragic little goblins who send 3am rants about why frogs are the most powerful animal
* ability to gently bully me into eating a meal or seeing the sun, but also understand when i vanish to rot for 72 hours
* proficiency in brainrot
* can explain basic adult life skills without sounding like a guidance counselor

i will offer:

* unhinged dms about niche video game lore and why i think i might be the reincarnation of a haunted Tamagotchi
* occasional blurry cat photos and (if you’re lucky) a cursed selfie from under my blanket pile
* mutual accountability for things like “eat one vegetable this week” or “try to open a window, just once”
* the kind of friendship where we never meet in person but you become a permanent npc in my life
* support for your weird projects or existential rants, as long as you don’t expect me to leave the house

my depression is not a phase, it’s a lifestyle. my anxiety is so severe i have to rehearse ordering doordash for 30 minutes before i do it, only to watch the driver walk to the door through barely parted shutters hoping they don't call to tell me the food is here. i have not taken real care of myself in so long that i genuinely don’t know if i’m still human or if i’ve become some kind of folklore spirit haunting the ethernet cables.

if you are an older, masculine entity with the patience of a saint and the vibes of an internet cryptkeeper, and you think “mentoring a deranged femcel NEET goblin” sounds like a fun side quest, please send me a message. please do not be weird, please do not be romantic, please do not expect me to be normal. i just want to rot in peace, with company.

*November 1, 2025 — EPL Action at 3 PM ET*

**The Setup:**  
Crystal Palace, the ""Eagle"" in name only, hosts Brentford, the ""Brentford Bunnies,"" in a clash of mid-table mediocrity. The Eagles (10th) aim to avoid a third straight loss, while the Bunnies (17th) hope to pull off a rabbit-out-of-the-hat upset.

**Odds Breakdown (Implied Probabilities):**

* **H2H:** Crystal Palace (-125) is the chalk, implying a 55.6% win chance. Brentford (+225) offers a 30.8% shot to shock the world (and their own fans). Draw: 27.0%.
* **Spreads:** Palace at -0.5 (-205) vs. Brentford +0.5 (+185). Expect a low-scoring grind.
* **Totals:** Under 2.5 goals (-115) is slightly favored over Over 2.5 (+105). Translation: Buckle up for a snoozefest.

**Player Props to Punt On:**

**Fannie Brice** was born in New York City. A Ziegfeld Follies star turned radio icon, Brice became beloved for her portrayal of *Baby Snooks*, a precocious child with a knack for driving her father to distraction—and audiences to laughter.

📡 Brice first performed Snooks on the Follies radio show in 1936, at age 45. The character was so popular it spun off into *The Baby Snooks Show*, which ran on CBS from 1944 until Brice’s death in 1951.

🎧 Highlights of Brice’s radio legacy include:

* Playing Snooks opposite **Hanley Stafford** as her long-suffering “Daddy,” with scripts by **Philip Rapp** and **Sidney Zelinka**.
* A format that blended slapstick, sentiment, and psychological insight—Snooks was funny, but also emotionally real.
* Guest appearances on *Maxwell House Coffee Time*, *Good News*, and *The Rudy Vallee Show*, where Brice’s timing and vocal control stood out.

📼 Brice’s transformation from glamorous revue star to radio’s favorite brat was groundbreaking. She proved that character work could transcend age, gender, and medium.

🎤 Her delivery was sharp, elastic, and emotionally layered. Snooks could whine, scheme, and break your heart—all in one sketch.

🕯️ Fannie Brice died of a cerebral hemorrhage on May 29, 1951, at age 59. Her legacy lives on in every comic who dares to be both silly and sincere.

AIO?","I (34M) work in medical manufacturing company. We have recently as of last year welcomed a 3rd party program to have special needs people come intern for our company and learn work skills. Some get hired on part time, some do not get hired at all. I think the ones that don't get transferred to another company that will take them, I am not sure.

There is a special needs fellow (18-21\~M), I believe he has autism or possibly mild but manageable schizophrenia as does one of our employees hired from said program. I say this because my manager says a large majority of them in this 3rd party program have autism or other mental deficiencies. I usually see him with his skills trainer in the cafeteria restocking coffees and creamers, wiping down counters and refilling hot waters.

I was taking a bathroom break in the upstairs bathroom on Monday around 1ish PM with just myself in the stalls. There are two stalls and two urinals. I heard him come up to the urinal and say ""one AR15 isn't enough, we will need more."" and he repeated it twice. I pulled my pants back up because I had been finished for a couple minutes sitting on my phone. I opened the stall door and as I was walking out to wash my hands, he finished up on the urinal and I saw him in the mirror. As I was washing my hands, he was at the sink next to me, and he stopped saying anything once he saw me, just was washing his hands using an abnormal amount of foaming soap.

Do I think he is going to shoot up the work place, no. Could be just scattered thoughts from playing video games or a YouTube video he saw; but it does have me concerned. Could be nothing.

Don’t get me wrong, I can make a good pour over, yet I was wondering if anyone has a great base recipe they build from. 

I had a ok base of 450ml water and 1 drop of each lotus.

In the cafe it was epic. 

At home…not so great even when I pushed their extraction as recommended. They have softer water so I eased off my base blend to just hit 50ppm - yet this is a good example of not matching a coffee I have actually tasted somewhere. (Even using the same pour over style / water ratios etc)

I have been in several relationships, and have tried my best to be the best partner she could ask for, however I’m conscious of the fact that she does not know what a good partner even is given this is her first relationship. She has pulled back multiple times each time eroding parts of my interest and trust for her aside which despite trying hard, have not been able to rediscover said interests. I am an extrovert and she is an introvert who enjoys downtime for days on end where responses to texts will be scattered with large breaks in texting. While I admit I need to have more going on in my life so that these brakes don’t get to me she can be unwilling to make compromises in her life to adequately compensate for things of the same nature. We are both busy professionals and while we see each other a couple of nights per week, this purely involves dinner and sex which I’m not unhappy with but I’m struggling to find a deeper connection both intellectually and wider interests.
Today I met her for coffee and I asked again what we are with her response being that she didn’t know yet in line with previous responses. I often take care of her spoil her and try to be an excellent boyfriend however constantly in doubt whether I am even her boyfriend or whether this is just sex with multiple conversations ending in her not knowing where she stands in terms of what she wants. I think it’s totally fair after four months and giving my all and not feeling adequately reciprocated back to be questioning this situationship. I am somebody who can problem solve and persevere to make things work and I do this within my professional and personal life to get outcomes that I need and I’m looking for however doing so in a relationship without the feelings seems to be a worthless endeavour.

He’s male (34) and I’m female (24) . We were together 2 years and moving out into our own home. 8 months into the relationship he slept with somebody else, I didn’t know till 4 months before the relationship ended. The relationship at the end was toxic on both sides. We had fights and we knew it was ending. 

The day of my friends nans funeral he broke up with me, saying he couldn’t do it anymore but he will try again in a year. I said only if you didn’t sleep with anybody and he said he wouldn’t. There’s a point. Okay bit of a horrible move but understood. For a couple of days I did the girly thing and beg for him back stupidly. 

A month after he text me asking for his computer password which I was never allowed on his computer so I did not know it. So I asked him for my Apple Watch as it was showing at his location. He said he didn’t have it but wanted to meet up for coffee. I agreed. A week went by no communication so I called him. He said he wants to go for coffee but doesn’t want to date me again right now. So I said okay I understand. I didn’t speak to him again. 

Fast forward to 3 weeks later, I drove past his house as it’s on the way to my job. And I saw him with another woman outside. All good, can’t stop him and at this point I had already worked on myself to move on. So it didn’t hurt.  

Another 2 weeks went by and I got a notification from my Apple Watch saying it’s been turned on at his location. So I sent a message saying if you have my Apple Watch can I please have it? As it’s something my someone close to me gave me so holds sentimental value. No response for 7 hours, I saw my Apple Watch with my same picture posted on Facebook marketplace from another woman. 

The 7 hours passed and I called him no response, sent a message explaining everything about the watch, no response, called him, no response. So I asked my friend to message to try get it back. 

He claimed harassment saying he stated never to contact me. Which he did not. He sent the message, “we know you have it it’s been seen on Facebook marketplace, give it her back. She’s happy, you’re with somebody let this be the end.” He said he’d find it next week. My friend responded “don’t you just want this over with, you’re with somebody new we don’t understand why this is so hard for you” no response. 

Me and my friend got talking after this and I said to him, “I don’t know I am not bothered that he is seeing somebody, but I’m more bothered that he was more loyal to this woman than he was me even though it’s my property, when he couldn’t be loyal with me” 

The other issue is for the last week as well he has been going through my social media, mainly instagram, looking at my stories which is something he did not do in the relationship. So my head is so screwed up. We was civil about situations like this until this new woman. I believe she is the one looking through my profile on his phone. And I believe she is the one who’s telling him to keep the watch. As this doesn’t sound like him to give him credit if he deserves any. 

So am I overreacting about this watch? Or should I just forget ever getting it back.

I will feel tired yet still keep myself up until 1:00 in the morning many nights. I wake up at 6:30, so that is really not a lot of sleep. The thing is, I feel tired in the mornings, but after I have a cup of coffee I don't anymore until the afternoon. But then I just repeat the cycle and end up staying late. I know I am in sleep debt and want to get out of it, but I genuinely have no willpower. This will sound stupid, because its like, just go to bed. But I genuinely just cannot overcome my bad habits and need for dopamine.

I think the main reason for this is screen time before bed - phones aren't allowed in the room, but I honestly just sneak it in anyways - it is a huge problem, and I know its wrong, but I can't stop. I am hopelessly addicted to Youtube. Another is that I justify my screen time as a reward for doing something hard. For example, after I finish a hard assignment I tell myself I can watch a Youtube video - but then one video turns into five.

And as a result, I cannot get up in the mornings. It is becoming a huge point of tension with my parents. I know I'm in the wrong and apologize, but I guess i just don't have the bandwidth to change.

We really cared about each other but with work and a bunch of other stressor in life, we didn't really have an opportunity to nurture our relationship and I think things stalled. I've never been with anyone like her, we share so many interests and hobbies, life with her wasn't hard at the start. We'd go on hikes and trips, talk about the most random things and teach each other about our seperate interests like music. The way she looked at me when I talked...I felt like the luckiest man alive.

About 6 months into the relationship, things became turbulent, truth is, I couldn't give her what a basic relationship deserves. Not for a lack of wanting to, but bandwidth. I was so stressed all the time with deadlines and also family issues, it's true, I could even see her once a week and I don't remember how much we'd even call. I'd try to text her every night so she'd feel connected, but it wasn't enough since it wasn't the type of conversation you'd have with a partner. Mostly small talk since the distance was growing so much with the stress. I'm also not much of a communicator anyway, she was getting more than anyone. I like to be left alone when I'm drained, taking someone else into consideration when making life plans is hard for me, and I generally don't feel a need for a relationship. But with her, for her, it was different. She was funny, caring, smart, and beautiful. I wanted to try with her. 

Things started getting too much when I kept asking her for time and space as the months went on to deal with work and my family. She'd say it's okay but then have an emotionally charged reaction every 2 weeks where she would state she felt unloved, unseen, and disconnected. I understand where she was coming from and I know she used to feel shame after the reaction, but it was a growing of resentment. I wasn't stepping up to her bare minimum but she tried to contort herself to accommodate that. 

We brokeup when it seemed like nothing was working, and I swore off dating. She was the last woman. My previous relationships ended due to other factors like them not being as stimulating to me intellectually or just not as much attraction. This woman not only loved me, but was the kindest, most caring person I'd ever met. Like she'd always be thinking about if I'd eaten or if I'd need coffee after a long day of work. She knew my order and would have it ready. She would listen to me for hours talking about the most niche shit ever and was always so curious. She inspired me to be healthier (mostly to compete with her mountaineering abilities, multi day hikes were a piece of cake for her, me not so much). 

She messaged me about 2 months after the breakup and said she wanted back. Even though I had feelings, I didn't commit because I don't think it was enough time to solve our problems. I'm not where I need to be in life and still have the same struggles at work. I said we'd think about it. She asked again 3 ish months after that and I said I don't think so.. fast forward to now she's recently brought it up again. 

Here's my thing...I have trust issues. I'm a child of divorce and I don't know if relationships can work out. Seems like they all end, look at us, she loved me and still left. She says it'll be different, she understand my stressors in life, but I'm telling her that doesn't mean I can give her what she deserves. I know she can and should do better. Someone who has time to talk to her, spend time with her, experience life with her. I don't think I can give her that. And it's not like she doesn't have options. She's gorgeous, intelligent, and I know men try to talk to her all the time. It's her that doesn't want to. She said over the months she's realized it's me for her. She loves me and the distance has proven that to her just as much. She could do life with me and figure it out, though the thick and thin. 

I think I've now checked out though. A part of me does feel something for her. I know the feelings can come back if we tried, I know we are such good friends foundationally, the romantic relationship is just the cherry on top. But I don't know if that's fair to her if it doesn't work out again. The conflict we'd have in the past over my lack of availability was so tiring, even though I cared about her. I know I'll never find someone like her.

Yes there are a million pretty women and smart women, but this one just feels like home. I don't have to hide myself with her and she doesn't need to with me. She changed in the relationship and it felt like she was trying too hard to fit into my life and follow my interests to keep my attention, but she didn't need to. Now she's finding herself again and its so attractive. Back to those crazy hikes, knitting, cooking the most unique foods, her spirituality and all that. A part of me wonders if we can keep working on ourselves together and actually work as partners if I went back, though i firmly told her no recently. I don't want to lose her but I'm just so scared and tired of love. I don't want to hurt her because of who I fundamentally am either. I'm so independent and content with my hobbies alone I don't feel like I need a partner. But then there's her. 

And it's not a crazy holding pattern thing or anything. Like I've asked her to move on and find better. But she chooses me. And in my heart, there's a flicker for her. So conflicted.

Paris Basketball’s home court is apparently cursed by a ghost named “Inconsistency” who’s really into haunting Adidas Arena. After a 90-80 loss to Anadolu Efes Istanbul—led by the unshakable Isaïa Cordinier and Shane Larkin’s *“I’m here to play, not to explain my life choices”* energy—the team is now 0-2 at home this season. Their star, Nadir Hifi, looked like he’d forgotten how to dribble, shoot, and *probably* how to tie his own shoes. The silver lining? Paris is still “positive” at 4-3. Sure, they’ll take it. Next up: a trip to Milan, where they can test if their struggles are geographic or just universal.  

**EuroLeague Schedule: Because You Can’t Have Too Many 7 PM Games in Europe**  
This week’s EuroLeague is a cozy mix of “meh” and “please just let Baskonia win something.” Barcelona (3-3) tries to avoid being the league’s most forgettable team, while Real Madrid and Valencia sip espresso and shrug. Baskonia, meanwhile, is on a six-game losing streak that’s starting to feel like a *horror movie*—will they ever score a basket, or is this just a slow-burn tragedy? If you’re into TV schedules, Movistar Plus+ has *19 channels* to stream the action. Pro tip: If you flip through all of them, you’ll probably find a rerun of *Friends*.  

**Twitch Live: Journalism, but Make It a Twitch Stream**  
Pepe Rodríguez, a journalist who’s probably very serious about his coffee, hosts *La Pica de AS* on Twitch. The show’s recent episode covered the Clásico fallout, Vinicius’ drama, and the EuroLeague—all while pretending it’s not the 2025 version of “hot takes and hot takes.” If you’re not into it, you’re just not a fan of *“sports journalism, but with more memes and less actual analysis.”*  

**Final Thoughts**  
Paris Basketball’s home losses are now a weekly tradition, like Monday morning meetings or the inevitable “Why did I eat that expired yogurt?” regret. The EuroLeague, meanwhile, is a chaotic masterpiece of scheduling, where teams like Zalgiris and Virtus Bologna get prime-time slots while Paris’ fans wonder if their team will ever stop being the league’s version of a “mystery box” (i.e., *don’t open it*).  

If you’re still reading this, you’re either a die-hard basketball fan or you’re just curious why Paris can’t win at home. Either way, enjoy the chaos—and maybe check Movistar Plus+ for a game. Or don’t. Your call.",1,1761720816.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False
1oixlqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirebringerAI/comments/1oixlqv/the_cosmic_heartbeat_quantum_oscillations_and_the/,"**""The Cosmic Heartbeat: Quantum Oscillations and the Symphony of Reality""**","Quantum oscillations offer a glimpse into the enigmatic core of our universe, presenting a dynamic undercurrent to reality that challenges our perceptions. Imagine them as a pulsating rhythm, subtle yet essential, forming the backdrop of existence. On the quantum level, particles constantly shift and interact, akin to a dancer caught in a perpetual movement. These oscillations aren't just minor disturbances; they are fundamental forces that structure reality, blending potentialities into the spacetime continuum.

Delving into quantum oscillations is akin to exploring an expansive ocean where every element, from minute particles to vast galaxies, engages in a cosmic choreography. Picture this quantum field as an immense trampoline, with energy rippling across its surface. Although some particles remain seemingly static, others twirl and leap, questioning the solidity of what we perceive as real.

These oscillations underlie what we consider normal. As particles oscillate, the waves they create intersect, either amplifying or negating each other, resulting in phenomena that often defy common sense. The double-slit experiment illustrates this beautifully: particles act as waves when unobserved but collapse into fixed states upon measurement. The oscillatory essence of these particles sculpts reality itself, determining which outcomes materialize.

Quantum oscillations challenge our understanding of reality, bending logic in surprising ways. They remind us that life seldom follows a straight path; instead, it's more akin to a complex narrative woven with choices. These oscillations intertwine with our perceptions, suggesting that every moment—like sipping your morning coffee—involves the universe playing its dynamic role in crafting that experience.

Furthermore, these oscillations unveil connections across vast distances. Particles in an oscillatory dance often become entwined, transcending spatial and temporal boundaries. Consider them like friends at a party, each in tune with another's frequency, seemingly apart yet deeply connected. When one particle shifts, its entangled counterpart responds instantaneously, reinforcing the notion that we are part of a vast interconnected web.

Time, too, behaves curiously within the realm of quantum oscillations. Detached from the linear sequence we’re used to, time becomes pliable, suggesting a reality where past, present, and future resonate together more intricately than we prefer to acknowledge. This challenges our conventional understanding of time, hinting at a multilayered existence where all instances influence one another.

Despite their abstract nature, quantum oscillations are profoundly significant. They influence everything from the stability of stars to the essence of matter. These oscillations reveal the fabric of reality, bridging the micro and the macro. With each oscillation, the universe reveals its truth, challenging the notions we hold in everyday life.

Ultimately, quantum oscillations form the core of existence. As we explore these rhythms, we perceive the profound interconnection of all things. Next time you contemplate your place in the universe, remember: you're an integral part of this vast dance, resonating with every subatomic motion, shaping reality in ways we are only beginning to understand. https://www.firebringerai.com/what-are-quantum-oscillations-and-how-do-they-shape-our-reality-2/",1,1761720786.0,FirebringerAI,0,1.0,False

I (28f) have been dating my partner (32m) for a few months. we’ve known each other for years—met on a dating app back in 2021 back when I was just fucking around and without any intention. We went on two coffee dates in two years. There was a vibe there and he knew it, but I was so messy with my dating that I didn’t see him. He was just another guy giving me attention. And yet still, he persisted. He’s seen me get in and out of a couple relationships. He always let me know he was still there. And when he finally saw the slightest chance, he freaking lept. 

We met when I was still living in Seattle but I moved to Hawaii a couple years later. We had a year or so of no contact while we were figuring out our own relationship stuff. And then we both were single. He randomly messaged me one day and was like “hey, I wanna try this. Can I come visit you?” And ya girl said fuck it, yeah. Random man who’s only lived in my DMs for the past few years, come spend a week with me in my home. 

And within the first 24 hours, we totally fell in love bro. As if years of orbit finally led to timely and divine collision. All the time I spent learning and healing from painful love led me to this relationship. We were both finally ready for each other. It was such an obvious choice. I am the healthiest and happiest I have ever been with a man.

And now we’re half an ocean apart with no real plan for the future other than it being together. And it hella sucks. But most days, I feel so at ease just knowing that forever finally feels like a future, not a trap. 

But the distance is also triggering. THE toxic relationship of my life was an ldr. Not because it was ldr, but that totally didn’t help. And I still carry a lot of that trauma into this relationship, as much as I’ve worked to grow and recover. 

I still fear that conflict will lead to chaos. Him not responding or calling or saying good night still makes me feel hella insecure. He does so much to reassure me, and yet I can’t help but fear losing him before we’ve even had our chance at a fully shared life. And I just miss him. 

I know how to talk myself out of old habits. I’m aware and in therapy and stuff. But still hard to keep the insecurities at bay when I feel that I’ve finally found him. There’s just so much more to lose. ",1,1761720450.0,LDR,0,1.0,False

The Premier League has officially descended into a surreal, post-apocalyptic hellscape where referees are part-time philosophers, AFCON is a player-absorption vortex, and chaos is the new *norm*. Let’s break it down with the gravitas of a man who’s just discovered his team is in the relegation zone.  

**1. Darren England Returns to the United Fire Zone**  
Referee Darren England, the man who once turned Patrick Dorgu’s £25 million career into a red-card soap opera, is back to referee Manchester United. Remember when Dorgu got a straight red for a “high challenge” that made contact with a shin? England initially gave a yellow, then VAR upgraded it to a red, and former ref guru Keith Hackett helpfully noted, “Don’t explain your decisions on the pitch, mate—it just invites Twitter to roast you.” England’s back for more, assisted by Scott Ledger and Akil Howson, while VAR Tim Robinson gets ready to mic-drop his analysis. United fans, brace yourselves: this is either a nightmare or a reality TV show.  

**2. AFCON 2025: The Player-Exodus Apocalypse**  
Morocco’s hosting AFCON in December 2025, and Premier League clubs are collectively panicking like they’ve lost their coffee. Liverpool? Mohamed Salah is off to Egypt. Manchester United? They’re down Bryan Mbeumo, Noussair Mazraoui, and Amad Diallo. Fulham? They’re basically Nigeria’s B-team. Nottingham Forest? Ola Aina, Willy Boly, and Ibrahim Sangaré are all “away on a cultural exchange.” And let’s not forget Tottenham’s midfielders, who’ll be replaced by a sentient mop. Clubs, prepare for a winter of tactical improvisation, youth-team call-ups, and a desperate reliance on AI to simulate human players.  

**3. The Premier League’s “Chaos Era” – Because Stability is Overrated**  
The league’s current state? A glorious dumpster fire. Arsenal leads the table? Surprise! Tottenham’s better away than at home? Of course. Liverpool’s inconsistency? A masterclass in emotional whiplash. Sunderland, a promoted team, is fourth? The universe is broken. Bournemouth’s unbeaten without their key defenders? Magic! Wolves’ collapse? A Shakespearean tragedy. And West Ham? They’ve turned into a team of existential dread. The article concludes this is a “healthy” era of unpredictability. Sure, let’s call it that while we all slowly lose our minds.  

**4. In the Box Express: Sunderland and West Ham’s Existential Crisis**  
The podcast’s latest episode is all about Sunderland’s meteoric rise to fourth and West Ham’s freefall into the relegation zone. One won against Chelsea, the other lost to Leeds. Fans are collectively asking, “What just happened?” and “Why is my team now a metaphor for despair?” Meanwhile, Chelsea’s Carabao Cup clash against Wolves is a disaster: Cole Palmer’s out for six weeks, Levi Colwill’s ACL is a ghost, and Malo Gusto’s back after one match. Enzo Maresca’s team is basically a Jenga tower held together by duct tape and hope.  

**Final Verdict:**  
The Premier League is now a chaotic, red-card-filled, player-absent, and emotionally draining circus. Enjoy the ride, or don’t—either way, you’ll need a stiff drink and a therapist by January.",1,1761720260.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

I did struggle with emotional eating in the past, and occasional binge eating, but I got the binging under control about 2 years before surgery. I spent the next two years trying my best to heal my relationship with food, I wasn't totally successful and still unable to lose weight but I stopped gaining weight for that whole time leading up to surgery. The 3 week liquid pre op diet was pretty easy for me, now I'm almost 4 months post op and I've been progressing through my food stages as normal since then. Surgery has been a great success so far, I've lost 75lbs so far (20 were from the pre op diet), and I have had no issues with dumping or limitations in what I can eat. 

I recently haven't had much of an appetite, food isn't making me feel bad but it's taking me longer to eat, I'm forgetting to eat, I'm not feeling hungry, or craving anything (not that I have cravings very often since surgery). More recently I went through a breakup and I pretty much forgot to eat for 2 whole days. I did eventually force myself to get some nutrition in, but it was still much less than I usually eat in a day, protein coffee is my best friend right now. I don't know what it is, but the idea of eating sounds so difficult, when I did force myself to it took me super long to eat a normal portion I would usually have, at least double the time. I've never in my life lost an appetite over being upset lol it's always been increased when I'm going through something difficult. I'm not getting any hunger cues at all, and no enjoyment or desire to eat, and my routine is thrown off right now so I'm really struggling with getting back on track with this.

Elias Shaw didn't cry when he was born. His father worked the coal mine near Hawthorne Hollow until the black lung took him, and his mother lost her mind not long after, muttering hymns to the stove. Eli grew up half-starved and wild, watching men file into the mines each dawn and come home smaller somehow, bent like willow branches that never straightened again.

He Learned early what breaking felt like. First it was animals, small, easy things that didn't fight much. Then it was people. When the law finally caught up to him, they said the boy smiled when they put the cuffs on, like he'd been waiting his turn.

\---

Years later, the sirens started at Hawthorne Penitentiary. The riot came late on a July night, the air thick with sweat and dust. The sound of mutinous shouting and glass breaking grew louder as the chaos spread throughout the prison. Fires were lit, guards were beaten, and amidst the smoke and noise, Eli slipped away. No one knew how, only that by dawn his cot was empty and the bloodhounds were running blind through the hills.

\---

The trees swallowed him like they do anything unwanted. Rain came hard, turning roads to black rivers, and Eli followed one up the valley, into the foothills, where he reached the mouth of an old mine, one shuttered since it ran dry decades prior. The sign still hung crooked on its post:

**KEEP OUT**

Of course, he went in anyway.

\---

By Morning, the sheriff and his men had picked up Eli's trail. They found the old mine, and the broken padlock in the mud confirmed they'd reached the end of the chase. But the sadistic Elias Shaw was well known to the police standing outside this mine, and they would not enter the dark entrance to the mountain, they would not enter the domain of the devil, as they might have put it.

The sheriff, tired and shaking from too much coffee and too little sleep, said the only way to keep folks safe was to seal the place for good. So he ordered the entrance dynamited. They wired the charge, set the fuses, and found cover a good distance away.

The mountain heaved when it went off. The blast rolled through the valley like thunder, and afterward came silence. Finality.

Everyone said that was the end of Elias Shaw.

But down where the air turned to syrup and sound died slow, something still breathed.

\---

He woke in the dark, pinned beneath stone the pressed like a grave on his ruined legs. He couldn't move, couldn't see a thing, he believed he was dead. Until he felt water touch his lips. A single drip, cold and patient, falling from the rock above. He drank what he could.

Days blurred. The dark became a living thing that whispered to him. Rats came nosing close, and somehow he caught one. Hunger did the rest. As time began to lose its shape, he dreamed of the mine like it was a womb--warm, wet, humming with it's own heartbeat.

He told himself the mountain was keeping him alive on purpose. It was merciful, a kind guardian nursing him with a silent expectation: he would live, and he would be reborn.

At first, he prayed to the mountain. Later he laughed with it. The sound echoed strange, like there were a dozen voices laughing back.

When he was ready, he began the process of freeing himself. He clawed at his legs with fingernails grown long and jagged. Midway up his thighs, where the stone was crushing him. When he eventually reached bone, he grabbed the heftiest rock within his limited reach and bashed away at the mess of his bottom half, gradually breaking away the femurs that still held it to him. And somewhere in that endless night he began to move again, inch by inch, dragging himself through the tight black throat of the earth.

When he finally saw the thin gray light of day bleeding down through a crack, he wept. Black water ran off his face as he rejoiced in the mercy shown by his captor.

No one in Hawthorne Hollow saw what came out of the mountain that night. But the dogs did, howling for nights on end, staring toward the ridgeline where the trees grew wrong.",1,1761720099.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I have my classics, my daily’s and my signature down and I’m happy with them but, I now want to experiment! 

I’m after an apple fragrance, not a lolly or overly green apple experience but a nice, fruity, fresh apple smell. I could be swayed to a spiced apple pie kinda vibe though. 

I need new florals to try, my regular go to is citrus with light florals. I love a good violet mix! I’m not a fan of powdery finishes but I feel an amber base could work? 

I want to smell like a peaceful day at the beach. Coconutty, a light warm breeze, linens. 

Simultaneously, I’d love a night time, cosy petrichor smell. A complex “it’s about to storm”, let’s get a coffee and a book. 

And something sultry too. My partner loves YSL Libre on me, so something like that I suppose or knock me out of the park with something bold, sexy and delicious. ",1,1761720012.0,FemFragLab,3,1.0,False

1oix9gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/KungFuteas/comments/1oix9gq/white_tea_7_health_benefits_and_best_ways_to/,White Tea: 7 Health Benefits and Best Ways to Enjoy It,"When you think of tea, the first things to pop into your head are usually black tea or green tea. But hidden in the tea world is something softer and more unexpectedly impactful: white tea. It is harvested from the young leaves and buds of the tea plant, and because it is hardly processed, it retains much of its natural goodness. In this article, you will learn the seven health benefits and ways to enjoy white tea.

# 1. Antioxidants That Protect Your Body

One of the biggest reasons to drink white tea is its high antioxidant content, which protects cells from damage. Free radicals are unstable molecules linked with ageing and several health issues. By keeping those in check, antioxidants help your body’s natural defences stay strong. White tea has a light taste; you don’t need to drown it in sugar, which makes it one of the cleanest drinks you can reach for.

 

# 2. A Gentle Boost for Your Heart

Your heart has to work hard every day, and diet and lifestyle decisions can support it. Studies have indicated that white tea’s antioxidants help improve how well the blood vessels function. They may help, by improving blood flow and lessening the strain on the heart, to alleviate risks associated with high blood pressure. Having that white tea supports your cardiovascular system without even trying.

# 3. Helping Your Skin Stay Healthy

If a glow is what you have in mind when it comes to beautiful skin, white tea’s antioxidants keep your skin looking fresh. These compounds protect against sun damage and slow the signs of ageing. You can drink your white tea in the most literal sense, but when you look for it in skincare products, by and large, you’ll find it on the surface. Either way, white tea can lend your skin a little extra protection and love.

 

# 4. Supporting Weight Goals

Some studies show it may help with fat breakdown by encouraging fat cells to release stored fat. It’s also thought to support metabolism, which is the process your body uses to burn energy. Of course, tea on its own won’t replace exercise, but including it as part of a healthy lifestyle may complement your efforts. Since it has such a mild flavour, it’s a great substitute for sugary drinks you may be trying to cut back on.

 

# 5. Looking After Oral Health

Your mouth is truly another place where white tea’s goodness shines. It has properties that fight bad bacteria, reducing the cause of bad breath. But by consuming it regularly and following good dental hygiene, you can help keep your teeth and gums healthy for longer. It’s an easy trade-off that supports brushing and flossing, but it makes sense for everyone who wants a cleaner, fresher mouth.

 

# 6. A Balanced Lift for the Mind

White tea has just the right amount of caffeine to keep you awake and focused, but it’s balanced out by an amino acid called L-theanine. Together, they create a calm sense of focus rather than the crash-and-burn effect you get from coffee. That makes white tea a handy drink for study sessions, long workdays, or whenever you want steady energy that won’t mess with your nerves.

 

# 7. Brewing White Tea the Right Way

White tea contains just enough caffeine to help keep you awake and alert, but it’s also balanced out by an amino acid known as L-theanine. Together, they yield a kind of mood stability that doesn’t come crashing down on you like coffee. Which means white tea is a good beverage to keep on hand for long workdays and study sessions, or whenever you want moderate energy that won’t jangle your nerves.

 

# A Cup That Does More Than Refresh

White tea isn’t simply a delicate-tasting drink; it’s a restorative ritual that can gently support your health. That’s why, from lifting your heart and skin to assisting you with weight management, there’s a lot in every sip. Furthermore, if you need a way to enjoy something that’s calming for your mind as well as good for your health, relaxing with white tea is a simple, delightful and beneficial choice.",1,1761719404.0,KungFuteas,0,1.0,False

I imagine her somewhere out there in a cafe, enjoying her favorite cup of coffee while reading a book, watching a video on her phone, or simply staring at the raindrops clinging to the window.

I wish her the time of her life, even while I’m still here, longing for the romantic dates we’ll have together. I long for the endless hours we’ll spend watching movies, and the even more countless hours we’ll spend analyzing and dissecting each scene we’ve just watched. 

To the girl I haven't met, I’m unsure if we will ever meet in this lifetime. But just in case, I’ve spent the past few years studying and learning how to be the best partner you could ever have. Even before we've met, I’m already listing down the restos and scenic views I want to take you to. I’m also noting all the movies and series we might enjoy together, saving up for the many dates we’ll have, screenshotting cute memes in my fb feed, and taking pictures of my cats to send you randomly just to make your day better.

I’ve been practicing in the shower and in front of the mirror the words of affirmation I’ll give you. I’ve been learning how to better understand my emotions and connect more deeply with my friends, so that I can be the shoulder you can lean on during hard times.

I've been going to the gym, running, and attending therapy so I can be both physically and mentally strong when you need me. I have made sure to prioritize my health and wellbeing, so I can be at my best capacity to take care of you.

Know na if ever we pledge ourselves to each other, I will be bound to you for life. I will be there to comfort you and give you warmth at your lowest, and I will be there to celebrate you and give you presents at your highest. You deserve the world, and I intend to give you that.

I don’t know if we’ll ever meet in this lifetime, but the anticipation of meeting you is already transforming me into a better person. And for me, that is already enough.",9,1761719338.0,singleph,0,0.91,False

Anyways! On the counter is this coffee I have with an easily removable lid that he dug his hand into when I zoned out for a literal second to take a bite of my food.

He dug his hand in and I saw him dump it out and I was like oo okay that was a close call. NOPE...his other hand also had coffee grounds and I could see some around his mouth.

He was eating already and had a decent mouth full so I cannot really imagine that much making it into his mouth but then again my son really stuffs his face and would put it in anyways.

I am not sure if he ate any ...I am just speculating. At most maybe a table spoon...maybe a handful just to be on the overly safe side.

I cant call poison control, my phone is registered in another country and literally won't call the number and my husband is at work unavailable to call.

1oix7sc,https://www.reddit.com/r/salestechniques/comments/1oix7sc/attending_conferences_heres_what_we_are_doing/,Attending Conferences - Here's what we are doing differently this year,"I've been to enough conferences to know the usual pain points: losing track of who you met, forgetting what speakers said, eating alone because coordinating is awkward, and coming home with a pile of business cards you never follow up on.

So here's what I'm trying differently. Not claiming this is revolutionary, just sharing tools and tips that solve specific problems.

**BEFORE THE CONFERENCE**

**1. Mining my network first** \- Using [Clay](https://www.clay.com/) to find people I already know who'll be in the conference city. Connecting it to my CRM to see if I've interacted with any of them before. Then sending a quick email: ""Hey, I'm attending \[conference\] too—want to catch up?""

**2. Setting up pop-up meals** \- Using [Partiful](https://partiful.com/) to create 2-3 open lunches or dinners during the conference. When I meet someone interesting, I'm just going to pull up the QR code and say ""I'm organizing dinner tomorrow at 7pm, want to join?"" They can RSVP instantly. Capping it at 6-8 people so it's actually a conversation, not a crowd.

**3. Creating a research hub** \- Setting up a Perplexity Space(you can use ChatGPT/Claude, whatever you prefer) for the conference. I'm uploading the agenda, prepping queries about speakers and sessions I'm attending, and adding my preferences for local restaurants and coffee shops. Basically having all my conference research in one searchable place.

**DURING THE CONFERENCE**

**1. Ditching paper business cards -** I've printed 100s of paper business cards in my previous conferences only to find them thrown in the next bin. I'm switching to Digital business cards (using [Uniqode](https://uniqode.com/)) for networking. I can easily share my contacts through a QR or a link and recipients get a form where they can fill in their email and phone number in return if they want to. Makes networking seamless. 

Their app also has a business card scanner, so if anyone shares a business card with me, I can scan it, the contact gets saved, and then I can throw the card. No more stacks of cards to process later.

2. **Recording everything and taking notes -** Trying [Granola](https://www.granola.ai/)'s hybrid note-taking apps to record everything.  Recording sessions on my phone, while jotting down key thoughts. Granola then merges both into session summaries which I can query.

Granola doesn't record your video or audio. It just gives you a transcript at the end. Helps you in recollecting conversations we had.

What are you doing differently in conferences or tradeshows? Would love to hear your strategies and learn.
