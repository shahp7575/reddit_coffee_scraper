1nnkx97,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nnkx97/i_miss_my_teeth/,I miss my teeth,"  
I just want to start by saying I know this is 100% my fault. Pregnancy ruined my teeth. There wasn't much I could do about it but I had the mindset that it was worth it and I could just get them fixed after the baby was born. I used to post a lot about this after it happened, I even made yahoo news, but my baby was stillborn. My husband left me at the hospital and when I was discharged I checked into a hotel with an empty carseat and a broken heart. I was told he needed his space to grieve. Not even a week later he grieved all the way into the arms of someone else. They are now married with a baby and another on the way.¬†

  


My past pain pill addiction was something he used to blame me for not being able to give him a healthy baby. It didn't matter that it was over 10 years before we even met. It took me a very long time to forgive myself and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be forgiven and that is ok. After that I went into a very dark place and gave up. I stopped caring for myself and that accelerated my teeth issues. There was a part of me who thought if he saw how bad I was doing he would come back.¬†

  


My teeth are so bad that I can‚Äôt eat anything that isn‚Äôt super soft or liquid. It doesn't sound so bad except eating is now a chore. I love crunchy veggies and I was a big meat eater. I can't eat anything now that will put pressure on my teeth. Everytime i take a bite of something I have to check my mouth to see if any enamel chipped off because the sound of biting into a loose tooth is horrible. I use my tongue and the roof of my mouth to ‚Äúchew‚Äù the solid food I do try. I keep a big bag of pork rinds next to me for when I don‚Äôt ‚Äúchew‚Äù enough and need something to push the food down. I was on a low income list for dental assistance for over 2 years.¬†

  
I finally had my first appointment which was nerve racking, I almost didn‚Äôt go inside despite sitting in the parking lot. I was terrified and spent the entire appointment shaking with tears in my eyes. But you know what? The pretty receptionist with the beautiful smile didn't look at me like I was ‚Äúless than‚Äù. The dentist didn‚Äôt scold me and even though he wasn‚Äôt able to do anything except get me antibiotics for the infection I had, he told me he was proud of me for coming. I was filled with so much hope. It's stupid how proud of myself I was for going to that first appointment.¬†

  


I miss interacting with people. It‚Äôs been years since I made eye contact with someone. I hate seeing your smile fall when I slip up and show mine. I say slip up because I‚Äôve spent hours in the mirror practicing how far I can open my mouth before you see how bad my teeth are. I'm lucky I have a WFH job but recently I‚Äôve been wanting to get a part time job, maybe at a coffee shop or something. To ease my way back into the real world which is weird to say but I was basically a recluse. But nobody wants anything from someone with bad teeth let alone a drink.¬†

  
My infection cleared up and I was supposed to have my appointment tomorrow but the money I had saved up I had to use to save my cat. Even with carecredit I won‚Äôt be able to pay. I‚Äôll go back on the list and hope I don‚Äôt have to wait years again. I don‚Äôt regret saving my cat though, he is the only one who has stuck with me. I cut my matted hair. I have accepted that my body is never going to look like it did pre baby and it‚Äôs especially hard because my baby isn‚Äôt here. I‚Äôm not ever going to be able to be a mom but I think my life still has value. But everytime I look in the mirror I just see my teeth and realize nothing is going to change until I get them fixed.",2,1758543606.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

She‚Äôs about 4 years old and was adopted by my fianc√© as a young cat. She has two litter boxes in the basement that are regularly cleaned. Apparently, she‚Äôs done this before with other rugs that have some sort of shag texture (same as the current living room rug). We tried moving our coffee table to cover the spot where she has repeatedly peed, but she just picked a new spot on the rug. She will squat and pee on the rug as we are in the room, so she knows we see her do this. Is there any explanation behind any of this?",1,1758543534.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False

**Panda Pickleball Court (üìçSan Pedro, Laguna)** - 6.5/10 kasi although malawak ang space and competitive ang price ng court rental per hour, very limited ang parking space sa loob. Malapit kasi sa not so safe area kaya doble ingat sa pagpark sa labas. Also wala silang very designated places to standby like kainan unlike the other courts here, but tbf meron naman silang binebentang cool drinks üòäStill worth it for sure if malapit ka sa area and may kacarpool ka lang :) 

**Pickeball HQ (üìçBinan)** - 8/10 and would've rated this higher if mas malapit and accessible siya for me! Otherwise may space for onlookers lang and even a small kainan/cafe. Decent number of parking spaces .Okay rin pricing. Coaching is available and you can rent out paddles. Not sure how often ang open plays nila 

**Alpha & Omega Pickleball (üìçBinan)** - 8/10. Marami raming parking spaces. Coaching is available rin iirc. They also have a designated area for nonplayers na bukod sa courtside benches and they sell coffee!

**Festival Mall (üìç Muntinlupa)** - 7/10. Good space naman to play tiyaka at least di mamomroblema sa tambayan ng mga kasama na di maglalaro. Marami ring parking. Sadyang nakakahiya lang maglaro na maraming passerby üòÖ",2,1758542856.0,PickleballPhilippines,0,1.0,False

1nnkn3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1nnkn3j/my_ceo_is_not_paying_me_what_he_promised_what/,My CEO is not paying me what he promised. What should I do ? Is my career ruined ?,"Working at a startup, leading one of their verticals. Made the vertical profitable in less than 6 months of starting (joining date = vertical starting date as I was 1st employee). Worked my a\*s off for literally 14-15 hours everyday. As the 1st hiring I had to do everything, then when processes were set I started hiring my own team, got to recruit one of the most hard working and exceptional people I have met in my 12 year career.

In 1st increment I asked for 30% raise which CEO agreed to (since I was severly underpaid for my leading role) but he put majority of that 30% into an annual variable which I agreed but he did not define the annual variable structure since that would have mattered (capping, calculation for eligibility etc.)

Both agreed since I had been performing really well, we were able to build a product (SaaS) that was stable and solving problem for some of the industry giants such as KFC and Pizza Hut.

But then he did not put that varable into my increment letter and kept on stalling that he will tell me the exact value soon. I have asked him 5 times in the previous 1 year and every time he just stalls it by saying he has something good coming for me.

It's now been another 1 year and still no update on the variable. Without this variable my effective increment of last year is not even 15%.

On top of that, I was on professional services payout in year1 which helped me get all my tax refund which was significant amount, but for year2 I came to know that they without informing me added me to employee payroll instead of professional services payout, which has led to monetary loss to me since I did not get any tax refund.

Now that I am having another round of increment discussion (despite not having being paid the previous payable), how should I pursue it. Whenever I ask for my rightful dues he just starts behaving overly personal and kind, you can say he wants to pay me in kind instead of money. Would take me to 1-on-1 booze sessions where he buys expensive liquor and food to discuss how I can be a game changer for the company.

From 0 revenue 2 years back, we have reached a GMV of upwards of INR 10 CR ($ 1.2 Million) in 2nd year itself. We are growing 15-20 % month on month. Our expenses to earnings ratio is also exceptional. Expenses including everything (rent, salaries, infra cost etc.) are merely 30% of our inflow. (remaining 70% is going to CEO not me).

But on the other hand the company lacks basics such as Water Cooler, Coffee Machine etc. Office space is so cramped up that I have to do lunch on my small desk. There is no place to walk, 2 steps and office is over. 15 people are cramped in small space which makes it impossible to even do a phone call. For every phone call I have to do I get up and go out in the heat.

Majority of the employees are boot lickers and do the bare minimum to survive. CEO is afraid of them leaving so he just accepts the bare minimum that they do since anyways all of the money is going to go in his pocket. He recently bought a Merc worth INR 1 Cr ($ 110,000).

Note: I am in a tier 2 city and cant move out due to family responsibilities. My city has no other good companies. Those that are there know my CEO so that transition is not going to be easy.",2,1758542779.0,careerguidance,7,1.0,False

My focus was a mess, and my memory felt broken. I was treating my brain like a machine, but I was running it on fumes.

What I finally realized is that a lot of what we believe about productivity and focus is a lie. After years of feeling like I was in a mental fog, I unlearned these 7 myths that were quietly destroying my clarity.



# Your phone is how you unwind.

**The Truth:** Using your phone before bed isn't ""unwinding""‚Äîit's a one-way ticket to a restless night. That blue light and endless scrolling don't relax your mind; they fill it with noise right before it needs to consolidate memories and repair itself. Your brain needs a complete break, not more input.



# Multitasking saves time.

**The Truth:** Multitasking is a lie we tell ourselves to feel more productive. When you listen to a podcast while working or check emails while on a call, you‚Äôre not doing two things at once. You're just doing two things poorly. You're fragmenting your attention and exhausting your brain, leaving no room for deep, meaningful focus.



# You can run on coffee alone.

**The Truth:** Your brain uses 20% of your body's daily energy. When you skip breakfast and rely on caffeine until noon, your mind is literally starving. It will feel scattered and anxious because it lacks the protein and healthy fats it needs to function. Feed your brain before you try to force it into action.



#  A full day of work is a good day.

**The Truth:** Sitting at a desk for 8-10 hours straight is a silent killer for your focus. Your brain needs blood flow and oxygen to work properly. When you're sedentary, circulation slows and mental fog sets in. Your brain works better when your body moves. Take short movement breaks every hour to boost clarity.



#  More information makes you smarter.

**The Truth:** Constant consumption is killing your mind's ability to think. When you fill every quiet moment with a podcast, a video, or an audiobook, you're giving your brain no time to process or form its own original ideas. The only way to get real clarity is to schedule time for silence.



# Your productivity is a matter of willpower.

**The Truth:** The secret to focus isn‚Äôt a mindset. It's a system. The people who are productive don't have more willpower than you; they have better habits. They‚Äôve removed the obstacles that make it hard to focus. The key to a clear mind isn't trying harder; it's by taking away the things that are draining you.

This simple, natural routine ensures smoother makeup application, longer staying power, and a radiant glow that feels effortless.

¬†**Exfoliation (Coffee‚ÄìSandalwood Scrub)** ‚Üí Gently removes dead skin cells so foundation doesn‚Äôt cling to dry patches.

¬†**Toning (Rose-Based Toner)** ‚Üí Tightens pores, refreshes the skin, and helps balance oil production.

¬†**Nourishing Oils (Skin-Type Based)**

* **Dry skin** ‚Üí *Kumkumadi* for deep hydration and glow.  
* **Oily skin** ‚Üí *Tea tree + jojoba blend* to balance oil and prevent breakouts. ‚Üí This step is key to seamless blending and a non-cakey finish.  

¬†**Eye & Lip Care**

* Under-eye roll-on reduces puffiness + dark circles.  
* Nourishing lip balm keeps lips smooth and prevents cracking.  

¬†**Result:** Feels like a *mini facial at home* ‚Üí skin radiant & hydrated, makeup applies evenly, and doesn‚Äôt melt off during festive celebrations.

In our **Yuvaap community of 50,000+ people**, we‚Äôve been talking a lot about the *no-makeup makeup look*‚Äîand this exact ritual is the foundation that makes it possible.

¬†For a **detailed walkthrough + live demos**, you can also catch the replay on our **YouTube channel**, where we shared *extra glow tips*.

1nnkkig,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nnkkig/my_ceo_is_not_paying_me_what_he_promised_and/,My CEO is not paying me what he promised and keeps being over-kind and over-personal to avoid the discussion,"Working at a startup, leading one of their verticals. Made the vertical profitable in less than 6 months of starting (joining date = vertical starting date as I was 1st employee). Worked my a\*s off for literally 14-15 hours everyday. As the 1st hiring I had to do everything, then when processes were set I started hiring my own team, got to recruit one of the most hard working and exceptional people I have met in my 12 year career.

In 1st increment I asked for 30% raise which CEO agreed to (since I was severly underpaid for my leading role) but he put majority of that 30% into an annual variable which I agreed but he did not define the annual variable structure since that would have mattered (capping, calculation for eligibility etc.)

Both agreed since I had been performing really well, we were able to build a product (SaaS) that was stable and solving problem for some of the industry giants such as KFC and Pizza Hut.

But then he did not put that varable into my increment letter and kept on stalling that he will tell me the exact value soon. I have asked him 5 times in the previous 1 year and every time he just stalls it by saying he has something good coming for me.

It's now been another 1 year and still no update on the variable. Without this variable my effective increment of last year is not even 15%.

On top of that, I was on professional services payout in year1 which helped me get all my tax refund which was significant amount, but for year2 I came to know that they without informing me added me to employee payroll instead of professional services payout, which has led to monetary loss to me since I did not get any tax refund.

Now that I am having another round of increment discussion (despite not having being paid the previous payable), how should I pursue it. Whenever I ask for my rightful dues he just starts behaving overly personal and kind, you can say he wants to pay me in kind instead of money. Would take me to 1-on-1 booze sessions where he buys expensive liquor and food to discuss how I can be a game changer for the company.

From 0 revenue 2 years back, we have reached a GMV of upwards of INR 10 CR ($ 1.2 Million) in 2nd year itself. We are growing 15-20 % month on month. Our expenses to earnings ratio is also exceptional. Expenses including everything (rent, salaries, infra cost etc.) are merely 30% of our inflow. (remaining 70% is going to CEO not me).

But on the other hand the company lacks basics such as Water Cooler, Coffee Machine etc. Office space is so cramped up that I have to do lunch on my small desk. There is no place to walk, 2 steps and office is over. 15 people are cramped in small space which makes it impossible to even do a phone call. For every phone call I have to do I get up and go out in the heat.

Majority of the employees are boot lickers and do the bare minimum to survive. CEO is afraid of them leaving so he just accepts the bare minimum that they do since anyways all of the money is going to go in his pocket. He recently bought a Merc worth INR 1 Cr ($ 110,000).

Note: I am in a tier 2 city and cant move out due to family responsibilities. My city has no other good companies. Those that are there know my CEO so that transition is not going to be easy.",2,1758542575.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

¬†**Step 1: Exfoliation**

* Gentle scrub **2x a week**
* For dry/normal skin ‚Üí mix with *milk*
* For oily skin ‚Üí mix with *honey* ‚Üí Removes dullness + gives a smooth base.  

¬†**Step 2: Refresh & Tone**

* Splash **cold water** to tighten pores
* Follow with **rose-based toner** for hydration & balance.  

¬†**Step 3: Nourishing Oils (by skin type)**

* Dry/normal skin ‚Üí 2‚Äì3 drops *Kumkumadi oil*
* Oily skin ‚Üí *Tea tree + jojoba blend* ‚Üí Adds natural glow + prevents cakey makeup.  

¬†**Step 4: Eye & Lip Care**

* Roll-on for **under-eyes** (bye-bye puffiness & dark circles)
* **Lip balm**: coffee in the AM, fruity at night.  

¬†**Why This Routine Works:**

* Makeup lasts *all day* without touch-ups
* Skin feels hydrated, never tight
* Glow looks *effortless*

The breakup wasn‚Äôt explosive, but it was painful. We both agreed it wasn‚Äôt working, but I‚Äôve been trying to move on.

Once she even stayed for coffee and hung around the kitchen for like an hour,  while I was there, super uncomfortable.

I finally pulled her aside and told her I‚Äôd appreciate it if she didn‚Äôt come by anymore, at least not while I‚Äôm living here. She seemed hurt and said I was being controlling, and that her relationship with my mom is separate from ours. My mom, for the record, says she doesn‚Äôt mind seeing her but also said she understands why I‚Äôd feel weird.

1nnk6q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BZNNews/comments/1nnk6q6/iphone_17_pro_max_the_great_leveller/,iPhone 17 Pro Max ‚Äî the great leveller,"# One big appeal of the most expensive [iPhone](https://www.indiatoday.in/opinion/story/iphone-17-pro-max-the-great-leveller-2791280-2025-09-22) is its universality. It is a phone that is used by the world's richest man as well as a student in Delhi University. And that also illustrates a larger point about Silicon Valley tech.

[Iphone17](https://preview.redd.it/3i61pl04epqf1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8eb7d1bc329294d188e977051bcca1aa2b98ba1c)

Imagine this. In the coming days, Elon Musk, the world‚Äôs richest person, will change his phone. So, will our own Mukesh Ambani. And Gautam Adani. And Bill Gates. And Donald Trump, at least as far as his personal phone is concerned. And most likely similar will be the case for a Delhi university student who comes from a well-enough, but by no means obscenely rich, family. They all will move to the iPhone 17 Pro Max, the most expensive iPhone this year. They might not have anything else in common, but they will all settle for this one phone.

This is straight from Tau-ism¬†because it is a point explained by our own Tau of¬†Teen Taal. One evening in office, where Tau happens to be my boss and mentor, we were having a water-cooler moment when the talk turned towards the appeal of the iPhone. And Tau said the common man buys the iPhone, even saves for it and stretches the budget for it, because it is the only ""common"" thing that is also used by Mr Ambani. The world‚Äôs richest and most powerful people drive cars, wear watches and clothes, eat food and travel in ways that are inaccessible to 99% of people. And that means inaccessible to almost all of us. But in one thing there is a parity: We can use the same phone, which is also used by the King of England, by Elon Musk, by Mukesh Ambani, by Shah Rukh Khan. That is the appeal of the iPhone.

I was reminded of this as the iPhone 17 and the iPhone Air went on sale in India, with queues forming outside Apple Stores. And as I thought about it, I came to realise that it is not just the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Silicon Valley, and the tech that has come out of it, has been a great leveller in the last 40 odd years.

As someone who has looked at tech closely, and at how the Big Tech has behaved in the last 15 years, I have no love lost for the Apples and Googles of the world. When it comes to big tech, in some instances I am more militant than a 19th century Luddite, and more reluctant than an 18th century Amish. Reels, for example! But if you take a step back, zoom out and look at the tech landscape of the last 40 years, it is clear that Silicon Valley has been a great leveller in intended and unintended ways.

One way it has smashed through barriers is with devices, like the iPhone. Even as gadgets have become extremely powerful, since the 1980s they have become cheaper and cheaper. Companies like Apple, Microsoft, Intel and AMD have been relentless in driving the prices down. And for some reason they have never gone in for the kind of exorbitant markup that we otherwise see in industry after industry. On the whole, personal tech is the most egalitarian space in terms of prices and access. On the whole, the difference between the most basic and most advanced is narrowest in the tech industry.

Is this egalitarian world, fuelled by coffee-addicted nerds in Silicon Valley, good or bad in the larger scheme? I am not entirely sure if it is, or if it is not. Will this egalitarian world of tech hold in the coming decades or will our human nature, with all its peculiarities and faults, triumph yet again by putting the tech genie back in a bottle? Again, there are no definitive answers. I believe no one has them. But as I see the new iPhones getting out there in the hands of people, I am reminded again of the reason why I fell in love with tech in the early 2000s and then spent night after night trawling through the World Wide Web. The reason was, in the words of John Perry Barlow, that we were ‚Äúcreating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.‚Äù At least for a few decades, it has existed even if cracks have now started to appear.",1,1758541431.0,u_BZNNews,0,1.0,False

Coffee is holding us back from real growth.

Caffeine locks the brain in beta mode. It sharpens focus on small tasks but blocks theta, the state of creativity, intuition, and flow. Theta is where ideas appear, where the mind feels open instead of restless.

Kids live in theta naturally. That‚Äôs why they learn fast and imagine freely. Adults lose it under constant stimulation. Cut the caffeine and your brain slows enough to enter theta again. Clarity arrives. Consciousness expands.

I have a lot of negative feelings when thinking about this situation so will be powering the spell with the anger and frustration it causes me.

1nnjwrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1nnjwrs/explore_nutricost_citric_acid_powder_benefits_is/,Explore Nutricost Citric Acid Powder Benefits Is It Worth It,"Nutricost NC-CITACID-POWDER caught my eye when I was searching for a reliable and versatile citric acid powder for both cleaning and food-related tasks. At one pound per bottle, it promised to be a game-changer for a variety of uses around the house. Naturally, I couldn‚Äôt resist trying it out myself. Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve put this citric acid powder through its paces in nearly every situation I could think of‚Äîcleaning, cooking, and even DIY bath bombs. Let me share my personal experience, highlighting both its merits and areas where it might fall short.

**Convenient Design and Packaging**  
I‚Äôll be honest‚Äîpackaging can make or break a product for me, and this one did not disappoint. Nutricost has opted for a sturdy, easy-to-store bottle rather than flimsy bags, which means you can access the contents without the mess. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit neatly on a shelf and sufficiently airtight to preserve the powder‚Äôs freshness over time. The screw-on lid feels secure, which is essential when dealing with fine powders. While the packaging is effective, I did notice that measuring out a precise gram (the recommended serving size) can be tricky without a scale, as no scoop is provided.

**Diverse Applications**  
One of the biggest selling points of this citric acid powder is the sheer number of uses it offers. I experimented with it as a food additive for canning fruits and making tangy syrups, and the results were impressive. The food-grade quality ensures it‚Äôs safe for these tasks. Beyond the kitchen, I decided to venture into cleaning applications‚Äîdescaling my coffee maker and tackling some soap scum in the bathroom. In both cases, it worked wonders, cutting through grime with ease. My personal favorite use so far has been making DIY bath bombs with my kids. The powder blends well with other ingredients, producing fizzing bath bombs that dissolve beautifully in water.

[Check Nutricost NC-CITACID-POWDER price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b08nxxmwh7/)  

**Benefits**  
This product has some truly outstanding highlights that make it a strong contender in its category.  
- High purity and food-grade quality make it safe for consumption and food preparation.  
- Versatility; use it for cleaning, cooking, and crafts like bath bombs.  
- The bottle packaging is spill-proof and keeps the product dry.  
- Non-GMO, gluten-free, and vegetarian-friendly, which caters to various dietary and lifestyle preferences.  

**Limitations**  
Of course, there are a few areas for improvement.  
- No measuring scoop, which makes it cumbersome for precise usage.  
- While the packaging is practical, some might prefer a resealable bag alternative.  
- The product‚Äôs fine texture can make it a bit messy to handle, especially without the right utensils.  

**Peer Products**  
Compared to other citric acid powders I‚Äôve tried, this one holds its own quite well. For instance, some competitors sell their citric acid in resealable bags, which are less sturdy and prone to spilling. However, they may come with a small scoop for precise measurements, a feature I missed here. On the flip side, Nutricost‚Äôs product has a longer shelf life due to its superior packaging, and I appreciated the non-GMO and gluten-free certifications, which set it apart from cheaper alternatives that don‚Äôt offer such assurances. In terms of performance, both cleaning and cooking outcomes match or exceed others in the market, making it a well-rounded option.

**Value for Money**  
When considering the cost efficiency of this product, it‚Äôs hard to argue against its value. With 454 servings per bottle, it delivers exceptional longevity, especially if you‚Äôre using it for occasional tasks. The versatility means that you‚Äôre essentially paying for a product that can replace multiple items‚Äîvinegar for cleaning, commercial bath bomb materials, and tartaric agents for cooking. While there are slightly cheaper brands out there, they rarely match the quality and purity found here. For me, it‚Äôs worth every penny for the peace of mind that comes with knowing it‚Äôs food-safe and produced in an FDA-registered facility.

I live in Poland, so I'd really prefer people from Poland as well. Mind you - not necessarily Polish, I only mean location. I'd also rather meet someone from my age group, +/- a couple of years. But, the important thing is whether we vibe or not :)

A little more about me - I'm calm, rather easy-going, I don't say ""no"" to trying out new things (in reasonable frames). I find my way around kitchen and I can bake you a good cheesecake. If you'd rather go out, I like discovering new cafes, and I'm a foodie, so I'd definitely try out a new restaurant! I'm also learning singing, so we can go to karaoke or just sing together while on a car trip ;) I'm also interested in astronomy and other sciences, video games, Asian culture and more, so I'm sure we can find something to talk about!

I'd love to travel more, and currently on my list are Scotland, Iceland, Greece, Italy, Japan, China. But these are not the only countries I'd like to visit. And there are many places within Poland which seem interesting to me, like Moszna Palace, Cracow (among others).

Here's me. Recently I started working out to get into better shape. I try to take care of myself, but there's still a long way ahead of me to be my best self.

We talked about boundaries, and Andrea told me Kevin could spend one week a month with me. I told her I wasn‚Äôt trying to compete with her or replace her, and that I wouldn‚Äôt insert myself into their family or their kids‚Äô lives. Things were going great. Andrea was civil with me.

I eventually told Kevin I wanted to have a baby on my own, and asked if he wanted to be the dad. He said he‚Äôd need to talk to his wife first. Andrea said she needed time to think but eventually agreed. About four months later, Kevin got me pregnant. Andrea was nice at first,even congratulated me (over text).

I recently found out I‚Äôm having a baby boy. They already have three girls, and apparently Andrea got very upset when Kevin told her. She apparently stopped asking about me from Kevin and openly said she didn‚Äôt like it that I will give him a baby boy.

At first, Kevin was supposed to be with me when I gave birth, and then stay with me a bit longer after I came home from the hospital. Now he says he can‚Äôt, because my scheduled C-section is on his older daughter‚Äôs birthday, and the following week is his younger daughter‚Äôs volleyball tournament. I told him I thought Andrea was taking her to the tournament, but he said Andrea has changed her mind and now expects him to do it.

Am I overreacting and just being emotional? When we first met, I lived across the country, but I found a job close to him just so I could be near him. Now, it feels like every time Andrea comes up with a reason, Kevin uses it as an excuse not to be there for me

As time goes by, naging close kami at we show motives na we vibe (or baka assumming lang ako?), but on my end nagpapakita naman ako talaga ng mga hints na gusto ko siya. Like nagbibgay ako sa kanya ng mga bagay na alam ko magugustuhan nya, mga sweets at lalo coffee kasi mahilig siya dun.

Kasooooo!
Before 2024 ends mga October or November ata, bigla na lang nalaman ko, nag jowa siya!

I am questioning myself as of today, if masyado ba ko naging mabagal tlaga? kinulang ba ako sa sweetness or assuming din ako sa part na gusto namin ang isat-isa?

honestly di ko pa naman nasasabi na gusto ko tlaga siya, yet I always show it.

1nnju8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDsupport/comments/1nnju8z/lack_of_demo_is_such_a_frustrating_thing/,Lack of demo is SUCH a frustrating thing,"I don't know if anyone will have the guts to read this, because at least 80% of the people I see on this app don't know how or are too lazy to write a decent text.

My partner is a more frequent user of this platform, and he's posted about our relationship here a few times. Whether it was to expand his point of view on a situation, hear more impartial and alternative opinions, or just vent to feel better.

I confess that I criticized him for this, for not talking to me directly. And here I am, eating my words... It does make sense that some things are difficult to address directly with the other person, but also even more difficult to just ignore them within yourself.

I M21, he H28, we've been together for basically 2 years.

To make some sense, let's keep in mind that I have a specific disorder (Borderline), and he has another (Bipolar). We had a turbulent relationship for the most part, which only stabilized a little more this year, after he received his diagnosis, and consequently, understood a lot about himself. Despite going through so much, to still be together today, I feel that we've always been happy with each other, in our own way.

As I mentioned, we've had a significant improvement in our relationship. Since he started treatment. This helped him to see and associate many behaviors that were harmful to our well-being together, with evident symptoms of a problem that had not been treated for many years. And also aggravated as a result of this.

It would be petty, insensitive, and even a lie on my part if I said here that he doesn't try. I KNOW HE DOES! I notice it, every day.

And I also know how difficult this process is for him... So I overvalue every little improvement I notice, in order to encourage him to keep trying, and to show how much I want his improvement and growth as a person, and that of our relationship too, of course.

But this has put me in a place of extreme insecurity when it comes to expressing small details that I would like to be different in our relationship. I'm not talking about big things... To tell the truth, from an impartial point of view, they're even silly. But they make a difference to me, and feeling bad about it ends up with me.

Every time I feel frustrated because he doesn't meet my expectations in something, I immediately feel a huge weight of guilt.

I don't know if it's because I feel it's wrong to want someone to show their affection for me the way I'd like; and not the way they know or can.

If it's because I think I'm going to overload him with theoretically ""futile"" dissatisfactions, while he's suffering and giving everything he can to be someone better for us.

I'm the type of person who tries to show feelings in all the ways I know, to try to feel understood and reciprocated.

I'm the person who writes love letters, declarations, and encouraging texts on any given day, for no reason. Just so the person feels loved, noticed.

I like to give random gifts, just for the sparkle of surprise in the other person's eyes. And I'm not talking about anything exorbitant, basic stuff like 10, 20 reais in a little souvenir, you know?

I don't know, nothing elaborate, take a beautiful bouquet of flowers, just so the person knows I was thinking of them. A handmade card or note.

An unexpected invitation for a simple outing that the person planned. A coffee or meal in bed, just for the pleasure of taking care of the other person.

Things that seem minimal, but that make the difference in the depths of the heart and the desire of every woman.

(I'm specifying by gender because I never see a man complaining about the lack of affection from his woman. But always the opposite. So I notice in this a much more masculine characteristic, which must certainly be linked to a series of influencing factors for this.)

I like to do all these things because that's how I know how to show that someone is loved by me. But sometimes, I wish I was the person who receives this kind of thing too.

Sometimes I think I'll never receive any of these things...

And not because he doesn't love me or anything like that. But simply because it's not his style to think about this kind of thing and we're incompatible on this point.

On this subject, I always end up saying that no one is to blame in the end. They're just different ways of showing feelings. But I still feel resentful about it.

I wonder if it's selfish to want to receive demonstrations like this, or to be displeased when this doesn't happen.

I'm not sure if I'm being lucid about this, and I find myself thinking about the things that, for me, have lost their charm, because I never see the same enthusiasm in the other person as I have.

The love letters, which when I try to write nowadays, don't come out anymore. Because I remember all the last ones, which weren't even read.

The gifts that I can't give anymore, because all the others aren't even being used. The photos with beautiful captions and public declarations, which I'm ashamed to post, because they're never reciprocated.

I confess that sometimes I avoid seeing other people's relationships on the Internet, so that my head doesn't unconsciously make comparisons, and I end up feeling frustrated.

When I see some guy randomly posting a photo of his woman, praising her, writing beautiful texts for her on his social media...

This squeezes my heart in such a way and makes me imagine what it would be like to receive this kind of thing from the man I love.

At the same time that it seems like ingratitude with everything else he does, to think about this kind of thing, I can't help but want to experience these sensations.

It's the kind of thing that I deliberately left behind over time, because I love being with him so much.

At the beginning of the relationship, he even reposted one thing or another when I posted something of ours on my social media. Over time, I became embarrassed to do this alone and naturally stopped forcing it. Whereas nowadays, we don't even have a current photo of us taken together, let alone something posted.

I always end up hearing the justification that it's not cool to post this kind of thing on his social media because he works there. Which doesn't seem to be an impediment for any other type of content, besides us.

It seems that if I don't insist, it doesn't make a difference to him either. And this always reminds me of a day, right at the beginning of our relationship, when I snooped around his story files, and there was so much posted with his ex...

Photos together, things about their relationship. Even a photo of her alone, with him praising and thanking her. And everything posted by him, you know, of his own free will.

I kind of, I don't know, his profile was already used for service at the time, and it didn't seem to be a problem.

I never commented on this episode specifically with him, but that broke me inside.

Never having received anything like that from him, and still leading to arguments every time I tried to ask for something of the sort.

It makes me feel like he's ashamed of me, of us. Or that I'm simply not good enough for him to want to do these things. As he is for me...

Things that I've learned to swallow and keep to myself, so as not to create more problems for us.

Like when I get all dressed up for him, hoping deep down he'll get excited, to the point where he himself wants to take a photo, post something. And it simply doesn't happen, and I feel like anything.

The commemorative dates that are important to me, and I always hope to receive even a little handmade card. Or he plans anything that is, thinking of pleasing me or surprising me. And usually, all that happens on these days is that we fight over some nonsense, I get discouraged by the date, and we wait for the day to pass quickly.

Don't get me wrong!

I know my partner loves me. I know this, without any doubt.

I feel this in several other actions of his that signal this to me.

I feel this simply in the harmony and coexistence that we have together, every day.

I feel this in the way he looks into my eyes. Even the simple fact that he strives to be someone better is the constant reminder that he does what he can so that we can stay together.

Sometimes I just wish that showing this was part of his way too. And I wish I didn't feel like a piece of trash for sometimes wanting to be loved out loud. With actions and demonstrations of what I already know he feels.

I just wanted to feel once what it's like to be the woman who receives these things. And I wanted them to come from the man I chose...",1,1758540325.0,BPDsupport,0,1.0,False

First of all this isnt my main account, nor am i English native, created this to post on 2 related AIO subreddits, one in my native language and now a more ""international"" input.

Its gonna be a long one, but thanks in advance for sticking up until the end! - ill try to do my best to answer any questions this might bring.

So lets go:

Since this is a throwaway account, I used ChatGPT a bit, mostly for structuring the text and to help with translation. What‚Äôs written here is the reality I‚Äôve been through recently. It‚Äôs a bit long‚Ä¶ I repeat, i used chatgpt to better write what im going trough! Thanks so much for staying and reading!

**Me (M30s) and Maria (F30s) ‚Äì almost 5 years together.**

This summer we went through a complicated phase and ended up separating. Even before that, I had noticed my girlfriend (‚ÄúMaria‚Äù) becoming more distant, mood swings, and less emotionally open. I kept trying to be there for her, asking if everything was okay, because I genuinely wanted to understand and fix whatever was wrong.

During that phase (before the breakup), a couple of her friends (they‚Äôre her friends, not mine) went on vacation. Maria gave them a ride and ended up staying overnight since she had a few days off. I supported her, wished her well, but I felt a coldness in her messages. Above all, what hurt was not even being invited to stop by after work. During that time we exchanged a few messages and photos, but still‚Ä¶ Last year it had been different: I didn‚Äôt stay overnight, but the next day we all went to the beach, had dinner/coffee together.

This couple, especially the woman (‚ÄúJoaquina‚Äù), is very dependent on favors and constantly drags my girlfriend into errands and shopping, even when it delays or cancels our own plans. They don‚Äôt drive, so they rely on Ubers, buses, or friends with cars. Maria has a huge heart and finds it hard to say no.

  
**What led to the breakup**

At one point, I shared with Maria that I was feeling sad and even a bit jealous, because it seemed like her friend knew more about her life than I did. I told her it hurt to feel left out.

Here‚Äôs the part that upset me the most: my girlfriend told this directly to Joaquina. I was hurt. Not because I think she should never share anything with her friends ‚Äî I understand if she wants to talk in general terms (like ‚Äúwe argued‚Äù or ‚Äúhe felt jealous‚Äù). What I didn‚Äôt like was seeing the private details of our conversation exposed. To me, that should stay between us. If she felt she needed to vent, she could have phrased it differently or more generally, without repeating exactly what I said.

Shortly after, she broke up with me, saying she needed space and was afraid of ‚Äústanding still‚Äù in life. A while later we talked again, laid everything out, and reconciled.

**Recent events**

Recently it was the daughter‚Äôs birthday (of that couple). Out of courtesy, I sent birthday wishes (through the mother). I never got a reply. Maria said she would just ‚Äústop by quickly‚Äù during her lunch break, but she ended up staying much longer, which made her late for work and for our plans together. I supported her going, but I didn‚Äôt like how it happened.

To me, it also felt disrespectful because, the day before the party, Joaquina asked Maria to go shopping with her so she wouldn‚Äôt have to carry things alone. Joaquina knew Maria and I were doing fine again, but she stayed silent and didn‚Äôt acknowledge me at all ‚Äî just acted as if people should serve her when convenient. (Side note: this couple has every possibility to get a driver‚Äôs license but chooses not to ‚Äî out of laziness or convenience, making excuses‚Ä¶)

I told Maria I don‚Äôt want anything to do with that friendship. She can keep it if she wants, I respect that, but I don‚Äôt need those kinds of people in my life. Maria responded that if she ever gets invited to something without me, she‚Äôll refuse to go, because ‚Äúif they accept me, they have to accept us both.‚Äù I value that a lot.

Now Joaquina‚Äôs own birthday is coming up. I don‚Äôt want an invitation, I don‚Äôt want to go. Honestly, I half-expect one for Maria‚Äôs sake since I know she cares about Joaquina. But at the same time, I‚Äôve already warned her: the day she can‚Äôt help them, she‚Äôll suddenly become the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù ‚Äî just like has happened with other ex-friends in the group, who I‚Äôm sure distanced themselves after realizing what kind of people this couple really are.

**Where I stand**

AIO: I don‚Äôt want to ruin my girlfriend‚Äôs friendships, far from it. But at the same time, I don‚Äôt want Maria to harm herself because of a lazy couple and a wannabe influencer.

I‚Äôve made my feelings clear: as far as I‚Äôm concerned, Joaquina is on my blacklist, she won‚Äôt get even my shadow. At the same time, I feel sad for my girlfriend‚Ä¶ but also glad that she understands my side and is willing to set boundaries. I even told her she should be upfront with Joaquina and say she didn‚Äôt like me being excluded.  let‚Äôs see if she does.

**Extra question:** I‚Äôm torn about whether to ask Maria to be direct with them and just ask: ‚ÄúDo you have something against him? Why wasn‚Äôt he included?‚Äù At least that would get the elephant out of the room.

**For the record:** I fully trust my girlfriend. This is not about cheating. It‚Äôs about respect, boundaries, and the pace of our plans as a couple.

Even had a shooting, and now I can‚Äôt wait to go back to work where a customer is allegedly, going to murder me on Wednesday because someone on checkout touched his hand accidentally when giving his change.

Ive applied for id say well over 50 entry level jobs, think Kmart, Cole‚Äôs, local cafe, stocking shelves, on checkout, washing dishes and nothing.

I‚Äôve posted my resumes so so so many times on subreddits, I‚Äôve paid to have one made/customised/analysed, I‚Äôve gone through uni, and nothing, setup a nice LinkedIn, all my social media is all very presentable stuff id show to my boss. I‚Äôve got just about every cert I can relevant to my past jobs, handling food, coffee, handling cigarettes, working on site, all this, I‚Äôm free 6 days a week, currently work night shift anyways, so I have so much availability.

I just had an instance when applying at a new Bunnings opening up, obviously given my past experience I thought I‚Äôd have a chance, but then my mate (no offence to him) who‚Äôs worked as a greeter for less then a year gets the positions, verses my years of relevant experience + 2 references from other Bunnings stores employees and all this.

I got one single offer but it was $20 cash per hour at a cafe, and I won‚Äôt be told when the shift is till the day of, so had to say no as I want atleats a bit of notice and consistency.

My mum says it‚Äôs because my generation is to lazy and we have no manners and if I wanted the job I‚Äôd make new accounts and start applying again, but that can‚Äôt be it? Surely

1nnjo0y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hFwwvktbVk,You probably already own the best portable monitor for your laptop. Here's how to use your iPad as a second display,"If you've got an iPad and a Mac or PC, you're sitting on one of the best productivity hacks out there. Instead of letting your iPad gather dust when you're working, you can turn it into a high-resolution second monitor. Knowing¬†**how to use your iPad as a second monitor**¬†can be a game-changer for your workflow, whether you're working from home, a coffee shop, or on the go.

This guide will show you exactly¬†**how to use an iPad as a second display**¬†for both macOS and Windows. For Mac users, it's a built-in feature called Sidecar. For Windows users, it requires a simple app. Let's get your perfect¬†**iPad and monitor setup**¬†running in minutes.

# Why Use Your iPad as a Second Monitor?

* **Boosts Productivity:**¬†More screen space means less time spent switching between windows. You can keep Slack or your notes open on your iPad while you work on your main screen.
* **It‚Äôs Portable:**¬†It's the ultimate portable dual-monitor setup. All you need is your laptop and your iPad.
* **High-Quality Display:**¬†Your iPad has a fantastic, high-resolution Retina display, making it a sharp and clear second screen.
* **Touch and Apple Pencil Support (with Mac):**¬†When using Sidecar with a Mac, you can use your Apple Pencil to draw or use touch controls to navigate, turning your Mac into a touchscreen device.

# How to Use Your iPad as a Second Monitor (Mac via Sidecar)

If you have a modern Mac and iPad, this is built-in and incredibly easy. Sidecar works both wirelessly and with a USB cable.

1. **Check Compatibility:**¬†Make sure your Mac and iPad support Sidecar (generally, Macs from 2016 onwards and most iPads that support Apple Pencil). Both devices must be signed into the same Apple ID.
2. **Enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth:**¬†Both must be turned on for a wireless connection. For a wired connection, just plug your iPad into your Mac.
3. **Open Control Center on Your Mac:**¬†Click the Control Center icon (two toggles) in the top-right of your Mac's menu bar.
4. **Click ""Screen Mirroring"":**¬†You will see an icon of two overlapping rectangles.
5. **Select Your iPad:**¬†Your iPad should appear in the list. Click on it.

Your Mac's screen will now extend to your iPad. You can drag windows back and forth just like a regular monitor. To change settings (like using it as a mirror instead of an extended display), go to¬†`System Settings > Displays`.

# How to Use Your iPad as a Second Monitor (Windows)

For Windows users, you'll need a third-party application. Apps like¬†**Duet Display**¬†or¬†**Splashtop Wired XDisplay**¬†are popular choices. Duet Display is a paid app but is often considered the gold standard for performance.

1. **Download the App on Both Devices:**¬†First, purchase and download the app (e.g., Duet Display) from the App Store on your iPad. Then, go to the app's website (e.g., Duet.com) and download the free companion software for your Windows PC.
2. **Install the Software:**¬†Install the app on your iPad and the software on your PC. You may need to restart your computer after installation.
3. **Connect Your iPad to Your PC:**¬†For the most reliable, lag-free experience, connect your iPad to your PC using a USB-to-Lightning or USB-C cable.
4. **Launch the Apps:**¬†Open the Duet Display app on your iPad and the Duet software on your PC.

The app should automatically detect the connection, and your iPad will light up as a second display for your Windows PC. You can now drag windows over and use it just like any other monitor.

I've been querying for a few weeks now and have gotten a partial request (with a rejection with personalized feedback) and form rejections so far, so I'm reworking my query. This is the version I'm planning to use now, what do you think? Especially in regards to how hooking it is and how the blurb seems from an outside perspective. I also added the first 300 words.

Thank you!

\_\_

Dear \[agent name\],

I'm seeking representation for my LGBTQ+ romantic comedy SHE‚ÄôS MY MUSE, complete at 83,000 words. It is fast-paced and commercial, with an upmarket take on themes of acceptance, belonging and family.¬†

Cecilia Taylor is out of inspiration, out of time and almost out of a career- one she desperately needs to keep her family from financial ruin. A love-themed gallery exhibition could be her last chance, but her romantic dry spell has been persisting for way too long.¬†

When her childhood friend Nora Levine returns to town then, she sets off a whole avalanche of feelings‚Äì and inspiration. Busy facing her own demons and climbing out of the rubble of her old life, Nora has no plans to stay though. She‚Äôs just there for her brother‚Äôs wedding. The last thing she wants is to get caught up in old feelings.¬†

But as Cecilia‚Äôs art shifts from idealized romance to the messiness of platonic longing, things get complicated, and soon, everything is not so platonic at all.¬†

SHE‚ÄôS MY MUSE is a sapphic friends-to-lovers romance that aims at the sweet spot between popular tropes and emotional depth. It's a perfect fit for fans of Alison Cochrun, Casey McQuiston and Ashley Herring Blake, especially readers of her BRIGHT FALLS series. Although it works as a standalone, it's intended as the first in a series of sapphic rom-coms following a close-knit friend group.¬†

This is my debut novel, and while I have no professional publications so far, I have a long history in sapphic fanfiction. It's my plan to build a long-term career writing sapphic romances, using the pen name \[pen name\], although I am open to discussing pen names if needed.¬†

Due to your interest in \[personalized interest\], I believe that SHE‚ÄôS MY MUSE would be a great fit. I‚Äôm especially drawn to \[agency\] because of \[personalized agency value\] and I would be excited to work together. Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

\[sign off\]

Chapter One

Cecilia Taylor is uninspired, and it‚Äôs going to be everyone‚Äôs certain death.

First and foremost, it will be her own death. Then, her family will follow, one by one. Lastly, it might even kill her cat Snuggles, and it will definitely kill the cactus on her windowsill.¬†

‚ÄúGlad to hear you‚Äôre keeping a totally cool head,‚Äù Persephone Davies says, smirking with sharp sarcasm, her lips blood red, pomegranate red, heart shaped. Cecilia sees it everywhere now and it drives her crazy- heart shaped lips, a couple kissing outside, a love letter peeking out of Olivia‚Äôs hot pink mailbox. All Cecilia sees is *failure,* over and over and over.¬†

‚ÄúA totally cool head?‚Äù she repeats, her voice strained. She‚Äôs sitting in *Olivia‚Äôs Bakery*, holding tightly onto a scorching cup of coffee with one hand and her unravelling life with the other. Her last priority is a *cool head* right now\*.\*¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, take a breath,‚Äù Rose Walters says gently. Her sweet smile brings dimples to her full, rosy cheeks, her green eyes infinitely kind. She‚Äôs like a walking hug, and yet taking breaths doesn‚Äôt stop catastrophes. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt lose sight of the fact that there are solutions to this,‚Äù she adds in her mom voice, with a firm gentleness that might work if there were any solutions to lose sight of.¬†

However, at the ripe age of 28, Cecilia‚Äôs career is crashing like a flashy car that isn‚Äôt worth a cent in its totaled pieces, and solutions are a thing of the past. Her creativity has run out. Her creativity has run away from her, fled in fear, and with it go any hopes for financial stability.¬†

‚ÄúSolutions?‚Äù Cecilia asks. ‚ÄúPeople could *die*.‚Äù

She thinks of her dad‚Äôs hospital bills and her pregnant sister and her brother‚Äôs sole-custody toddler, and how much money would be missing without Cecilia‚Äôs income.

**What Does Luxury Living Room Mean?**

A luxury living room is not just about expensive furniture‚Äîit‚Äôs about creating a lifestyle. It includes carefully chosen d√©cor, high-quality materials, smart technology, and a thoughtful layout that makes every moment enjoyable. Unlike ordinary living rooms, luxury spaces focus on experience. From lighting that sets the mood to sofas that offer unmatched comfort, luxury design is about combining functionality with aesthetics.

**The Bengaluru Factor in Luxury Interiors**

Bengaluru is a hub of innovation and cultural diversity. The city‚Äôs fast-paced lifestyle and global exposure have influenced homeowners to opt for **premium living spaces**. Whether in luxury apartments in Whitefield or independent villas in Jayanagar, Bengaluru residents want living rooms that reflect **modern sophistication mixed with traditional charm**. This cultural blend is what makes Bengaluru‚Äôs luxury living room designs truly unique.

**Core Elements of a Luxury Living Room**

# Premium Furniture Choices 

Luxury furniture is all about comfort and character. Think Italian leather sofas, recliners, accent chairs with unique shapes, and designer coffee tables. Every piece should feel like an investment in lifestyle.

# Designer Lighting Setup

Lighting can instantly elevate the room‚Äôs vibe. Chandeliers, pendant lights, and recessed LED setups create both functionality and drama. The right balance between natural light and artificial fixtures is what makes a living room truly luxurious.

# Flooring Options

Wooden flooring offers warmth, while marble or granite brings elegance. Tiles with high gloss finishes are also popular, especially in Bengaluru‚Äôs modern apartments. Each flooring choice defines the character of your space.

# Walls that Speak Style

Luxury walls are more than just painted surfaces. Accent walls, textured finishes, and artistic wallpapers create a backdrop that enhances the overall interior appeal.

https://reddit.com/link/1nnjktz/video/fww1vgj68pqf1/player

# Color Themes That Define Luxury

Neutral tones with metallic accents are evergreen, but Bengaluru homeowners are experimenting with bold palettes. Deep emerald, charcoal grey, and royal blue paired with gold highlights are trending choices. The right colors not only add sophistication but also influence the mood of the room.

# Technology-Driven Living Rooms

Luxury is incomplete without smart features. Automated curtains, AI-powered lighting, invisible speakers, and integrated entertainment systems are part of today‚Äôs luxury living rooms. This seamless blend of technology with design creates a futuristic yet cozy ambiance.

# Textures & Fabrics for Elegance

Velvet sofas, silk cushions, and handcrafted rugs add depth and warmth to the space. Leather, linen, and sustainable fabrics are also gaining popularity among Bengaluru residents who value both style and eco-conscious choices.

# Luxury Living Room Layouts in Bengaluru Homes

Open layouts are the new normal in luxury homes, offering seamless flow between living, dining, and kitchen spaces. Villas often feature large formal living rooms for hosting guests, while apartments maximize compact spaces with modular luxury furniture.

# D√©cor That Makes a Statement

Luxury d√©cor goes beyond utility‚Äîit‚Äôs about personality. Sculptures, curated paintings, premium rugs, and indoor plants bring character to the room. Each element should tell a story about your lifestyle and preferences.

# Lighting as the Centerpiece

Statement chandeliers and designer lamps are often the highlight of a luxury living room. These not only brighten the room but also act as centerpiece d√©cor, creating an instant ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor when guests enter.

1nnjjvm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nnjjvm,Milton Keynes tram network proposal:,"
I wrote an article about this in detail when I was a member of a transport advocacy group called En Route. I lived in Milton Keynes for a bit and was endlessly perplexed by the place. However, one thing that stood out to me was not just the criss cross of all the highways but the large verges next to them that could so easily have trams running along. I think this could be the cheapest network to build as there is so much space next to all the roads whether it‚Äôs grass or parking spaces. With all 4 lines meeting at centre MK, I would have them all go along mostly H and V roads with some going straight through the neighbourhoods inside. Only one line I would have go along an old railway, the Wolverton to Newport Pagnell line. These would be routed to serve all retail parks and the main out of town centres such as Stadium MK. All the pre MK towns and city‚Äôs train stations would have at least one tram line with Bletchley, Newport Pagnell and Stoney Stratford each having two. With most of these places being at the end of tram lines, this should create lots of bidirectional traffic throughout the day.",18,1758539386.0,miltonkeynes,10,1.0,False

1nnjjg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SSBM/comments/1nnjjg0/advice_for_new_players_from_a_goinmul_player/,Advice for new players from a goinmul player,"Lately been seeing a lot of frustration posts floating on the sub around here. It's hard to tell the memes and bait from the genuine venting so I thought I would float some advice to all the newcomers from a casual gold player and normal 2-2 tourney scrub prospective. 


First off, if you're picking up the sticks for the first time it is best that you find a character that you enjoy and then really *learn* that character. I think a lot of people have a normal FGC mindset where they pick their main and think a few BnB combos will get them somewhere. In this game that isn't enough. When you choose your character you should understand their moveset; their normal gameplan; their kill percents; their death percents; specific movement tech; defensive strategies; the stages that work for you; your kill moves and on and on and on. **For the love of god** look at the tierlist because it will give you an idea of how much work you're going to have to put in in this game with your character. I feel like people pick the character that looks the coolest/cutest to them (specifically talking about lowtiers here) and don't realize there isn't much easily accessible information about the character, or that it takes a LOT of fundamental knowledge of the game for that character to be viable (e.g Zain fighting for his life to get top 50 with Kirby) 


Secondly please please please remember that Melee is OLD. There's an FGC term called *goinmul* which is korean for ""stagnant water"" meaning a game that has a dedicated player base with years of experience that doesn't see new players too too often. You're fighting people who probably have held sticks for longer than you've been alive in some (albeit rare) cases. There's so much cheese, random tech, and chump checks that you have to wade through before you can even start to really enjoy the game that most players who have been chilling out in this stagnant water already know like the back of their hand. For example, getting hit with a phantom for the first time will feel weird for a while until you can recognize one and retaliate someone for it.


Third. With everything said above if you want to have fun and see yourself progress in this game do yourself two favors: 
- Find the 20XX hack pack iso
- And please fund Fizzi's coffee addiction by unlocking ranked mode
I'll expand on this later. 


I see so much angst posted about unranked and while it isn't *largely* unwarranted I think a lot of people underestimate how steep the hill to climb is to just play this game competently. Its not the nicest thing, but in unranked there are probably a lot of people just like you who's been getting bent over a barrel by some veteran player for the better part of two hours. So when they match make with you and they actually start getting hits and combos and winning they are more likely than not (especially if they're a falco) start to BM all over you because they can finally play the fucking game for themselves. It isn't right, it doesn't feel fair, and that just is how it is if you're going to grind unranked.


Fourth. I akin learning this game to something like learning Go or Chess. There are a lot of mechanics and specific scenarios that you will get absolutely railed in if you don't know what you're looking at. At the same time if you don't get your ass absolutely demolished every time in those specific scenarios you'll never learn. You need to accept that you're going to be piss all at this game for a while and you should understand that the fun is in the struggle of beating your current demons (techskill, mental, or strategy) and facing new ones. There is no glass ceiling in Melee and that's the scary beauty of the game!


So to facilitate your learning let's point back at that list I gave you on point ""third."" For arguments sake, you *can* grind out techskill, but that will only get you so far if you don't know how to apply it. A recommendation I don't see on here nearly enough is to go fight bots. It isn't going to teach you ""ze mindgames"" or ""the fundamentals,"" but it will give you the chance to learn how to move your character in and out of danger/threatzones in Matchups; how to punish different characters with their own specific weights, airspeeds, and endlag; how to combo optimal/strategic DI; allow you to explore different gameplans and playstyles for your character; and expose you more to the surface level nuances of Melee with no stakes. It is **NOT** the end all be all to training for this game, BUT for learning the game, its mechanics, and how to play its a great place to start. Afterall Armada played heavily against bots as training iirc, but it could be argued that that was a different time; tomato tom√°to. 


I'd genuinely recommend if you're brand new to the game, and/or unranked is grinding your gears, that if you can't 5-0 the entire roster in 20XX at level 9 with your main you shouldn't play unranked with a casual mindset. And if you're getting packed in by lvl 9 bots adjust the difficulty down until you can 5-0 the entire roster *and then* work towards picking out the blemishes in your gameplay until you can defeat the entire roster at its hardest. It's something I think a lot of us console players took for granted growing up with the game, but we DID THIS with All-Star mode all the time if you played a lot of  1-p mode during your childhood, I know I did. That aside, you SHOULD still play ranked as you're on your 20XX grind as you're likely to play closer to your MMR than getting randos in unranked, and that will get you adjusted to different pings, competitive strategies, more weird Melee BS, player techflubs, and fighting for stakes. 


One last piece of advice. I'm gonna call myself out a bit here too (so please take heed future me), but for the love of fucking christ ***DON'T pay for ranked if you're going to play less than 100 sets in the season total and then give up.*** It's cheaper than your order at starbucks for a month and the point is to LEARN; tell your elo ego to fuck off. Try to get as many ranked games in a season in as you can and start getting used to playing ranked with a casual unranked grindset mindset(if you play at least 500 sets of ranked total you've paid a penny for each fight and that's DAMN good in this economy). This will adapt you to competitive fighting and will give you your true ELO score as its so easy to look at your winrate of 30-15 or 1-20 at a lull in the season and think, ""Man I'm badass/suck ass at this game...""

# O!RUL8,2?

BTS released [O!RUL8,2?](https://i.imgur.com/wsA25Zn.gif) on September 11, 2013, with title track N.O. BigHit had this to say about the release:

> With O!RUL8,2? (Oh! Are you late, too?), BTS offers the message that ‚Äúyou must find your happiness and your own life before it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù
Lyrics that brutally lay open reality as it is deliver a bold admonition to a world that inflicts despair. Children are raised as studying machines without a chance to think about the future.
A world where classmates are not friends but competitors trying to trample each other. BTS sings about the wounds and anguish that such hopeless life has left on today‚Äôs teens. ([source](https://ibighit.com/bts/eng/discography/detail/o_rul8_2.html))

**Tracklist**
* INTRO : O!RUL8,2?
* N.O
* We On
* Skit: R U Happy Now?
* If I Ruled the World
* Coffee 
* BTS Cypher PT.1 
* Attack on Bangtan

First time writing here. 5 years ago I bought the PC you see in the screenshots but I changed the previous RTX 2080 for a RX 9070. After playing Oblivion Remake or BF 6 Beta I saw my GPU was not enough for the upcoming games. Also, for some games I had random annoying stuttering (but I thought it was only GPUs fault). Now with the new 9070 I'm having the same issues and I've tried a lot of fixes:

ReSize Bar, XMP, deactivating Game Mode, reinstalling drivers and disabling Radeon Boost...

Can someone help me to understand why?

Don‚Äôt want to be stingy, but also don‚Äôt want to be weirdly overbearing offering tea every half hour.

For those in the UK (especially tradespeople), what‚Äôs the usual etiquette?

Do you offer a brew as soon as they get there, or wait until they‚Äôve started?

How often do you top up? Every hour? Only if they ask?

Tea vs coffee vs water/squash ‚Äî what do people actually appreciate? Does it change if it‚Äôs roasting in summer vs freezing in January?

Any biscuits that go down well, or is that overkill? I was thinking basic digestives, but don‚Äôt want to be tight if custard creams are more standard.

Mugs vs disposable cups ‚Äî is either fine? I‚Äôve got decent mugs but don‚Äôt want washing up on site.

If it‚Äôs a whole team, do you ask everyone‚Äôs order or is that a faff? Just say ‚Äúmilk/sugar?‚Äù and work it out?

I‚Äôm in the south-east, but interested in regional differences too. I hear ‚Äúbrew‚Äù used a lot up north ‚Äî does that change expectations?

I've been on a mission lately to explore different tea varieties from around the world, and I wanted to share my recent discovery that completely changed my tea-drinking experience. After trying countless local shops and generic supermarket options, I finally found this amazing tea sampler that includes blends from various countries.

I'm talking about loose-leaf teas that actually taste different from one another (unlike those basic grocery store tea bags). The sampler I found includes everything from Chinese oolong to Japanese sencha, Indian masala chai, and even some unique herbal blends I'd never heard of before.

What I particularly love about this specific collection (which you can check out here: https://athometouch.com/tea-sampler) is how they've organized the teas by region and included brewing instructions for each variety. As someone who used to steep everything for 3 minutes in boiling water (I know, I know), this was a game-changer.

The package comes with enough tea to make about 50 cups, which is perfect for discovering what you really like without committing to large quantities. Each tea comes in its own sealed pouch to maintain freshness, and they've included these cute little cards explaining the origin and flavor notes of each blend.

Some standout favorites from my experience:
- The Taiwanese high mountain oolong (seriously, it's like drinking liquid gold)
- A really interesting South African rooibos blend
- This amazing Earl Grey with real bergamot oil
- A super smooth Chinese jasmine green tea

If you're interested in expanding your tea horizons like I did, you can find the sampler here: https://athometouch.com/tea-sampler. They also include a really helpful guide about water temperatures and steeping times, which helped me stop burning my green teas (whoops).

I've found that having this variety has actually helped me cut down on my coffee intake, and it's become a really enjoyable part of my daily routine. Plus, it's been fun to share these different teas with friends who come over - it's like having a mini tea tasting session!

Just remember to store your teas properly (away from light and moisture) to keep them fresh longer. And don't be afraid to experiment with steeping times and temperatures - sometimes small adjustments can make a huge difference in taste.

Anyone else here passionate about exploring different tea varieties? I'd love to hear about your favorite blends or tea-related discoveries!",1,1758538525.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

According to sources close to the server, Blizzard's legal team found out that the server's staff were using real vanilla extract in their coffee instead of the usual artificial flavoring. This blatant violation of Blizzard's intellectual property rights has left the server's community in a state of chaos.

Players on the server have taken to the forums to express their outrage at Blizzard's heavy-handed tactics. Many are questioning why Blizzard would go after a private server for something as trivial as using real vanilla extract in their coffee.

In response to the backlash, Blizzard released a statement saying, 'We take the protection of our intellectual property very seriously, whether it's in the game itself or in the beverages served at private server staff meetings.' The statement has only fueled the fire, with players calling for a boycott of Blizzard's products.

As the drama continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the World of Warcraft Vanilla private server will comply with Blizzard's demands or if they will stand their ground and continue to brew their coffee with real vanilla extract.

Stay tuned for updates on this developing story.

1nnj71v,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1nnj71v/neighbor_thinks_my_free_time_belongs_to_them/,Neighbor thinks my free time belongs to them,"I live in an older apartment building where most people keep to themselves, but one of my downstairs neighbors has slowly convinced themselves that I‚Äôm their personal on-call helper. At first it seemed harmless they asked me once to help carry in groceries, another time to move a box, and I didn‚Äôt mind. I figured it was just neighborly kindness. But over the months it‚Äôs become this ongoing thing, like every week there‚Äôs a new ‚Äúfavor‚Äù they expect.  
  
Last week really pushed me over the edge. I had just finished a long shift, cooked dinner, and was finally enjoying some down time. I was online with a couple of friends, half distracted playing on my phone while we talked, when there was this loud knock on my door. Sure enough, it was them. This time they wanted me to come downstairs ‚Äújust for a few minutes‚Äù to help rearrange their entire living room couches, tables, the works.  
  
I told them I couldn‚Äôt right then, and they gave me this look like I‚Äôd just refused to pull a kid out of a burning building. They muttered something about ‚Äúyoung people having all this free time and not wanting to help anyone anymore‚Äù and stomped off. Meanwhile, I sat there trying to process how someone could think it‚Äôs normal to show up uninvited and expect me to act like their moving service on demand. The part that really gets me is the entitlement. I‚Äôve helped them plenty of times before, but apparently the one time I say no, I‚Äôm suddenly the villain. And it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôve ever offered me anything in return no coffee, no thanks beyond a quick ‚Äúyou‚Äôre strong, you can handle it.‚Äù Just an expectation that I‚Äôll keep saying yes forever.  
  
I get that neighbors should help each other sometimes, and I don‚Äôt mind doing that within reason, but this feels like the respect only goes one way. I don‚Äôt want to start drama in the building, but I also don‚Äôt want to keep being the ‚Äúeasy option‚Äù every time they need muscle.

It definitely calmed me and helped me start my daily tasks without so much of the usual procrastination, however it wore off after 3-4 hours.

Doc gave the go ahead to take 40mg second week. It‚Äôs literally knocked me out to sleep within 60 minutes of taking it. Like I cannot keep my eyes open. I was talking to my husband on the phone and couldn‚Äôt form sentences or thoughts properly. 

I figured it would get better but it‚Äôs been like this nearly every day for three days and I just don‚Äôt function while I‚Äôm on it. Even after I wake up I feel foggy and tired all day until dinner when I can feel it wearing off and my brain comes back to life. It‚Äôs so frustrating. I thought this was supposed to help my functioning not make it worse? 

Anyway, the weird thing is that I was given a dex top up if needed and that has been great. Zero tiredness, zero sleep or anxiety issues. Helps me think clearly and stay calm while also getting things done. 

What going on? Why would this be the case that one works fine and the other has the opposite effect? Anyone else experience this? 

I have an appointment coming up to discuss with my doc but I don‚Äôt want to come across as drug seeking because I prefer the dex. Is there any reason why Vance would do this but not dex? 

Also before anyone asks: I‚Äôve tested different days of eating protein or not eating, with or without coffee. Coffee actually seems to help lift the sleepiness, but I end up drinking more of it than I usually would so seems pointless taking the vyvance if that‚Äôs the case. 

Generally I don‚Äôt feel high or hyper on either dex or vyvance. It‚Äôs more that the vyvance feels like Valium or a strong sedative whereas the dex feels like a very strong coffee. 

Any comments welcome. I‚Äôm just ruminating til my appointment lol

I‚Äôm not an [**iptv reseller**](https://xxiptv.top/), just a curious user switching devices between US, UK, CA, and even FR while traveling. What matters to me are price balance, channel variety, and how reliable streams actually feel. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd rank them:

**1\.** [**XXIPTV**](https://xxiptv.top/) ‚Äì Definitely the most stable for me. Solid movie catalog, strong sports coverage, and pricing that makes sense compared to other [**iptv providers**](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/). Even during UK prime time, I didn‚Äôt get the usual buffering headaches.

**2\.** [**IPTVMEZZY**](https://www.reddit.com/r/iptv_provider_2025/wiki/index/) ‚Äì Honestly one of my more surprising finds. I went in with low expectations, but on my Firestick in CA streams stayed smoother than I thought. Maybe not the biggest package, but in day‚Äëto‚Äëday use it held up well.

**3\.** [**Aurorastreaming**](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/) ‚Äì Good visual layout and their [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://aurorastreaming.online/) option felt generous in terms of included channels. The catch: during FR football matches I noticed some stutter at peak hour. Otherwise, pretty solid.

**4\.** [**NebulaCast**](https://xxiptv.top/) ‚Äì Their [**best iptv trial**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Best_LPTV/wiki/index/) looked nice on paper, lots of channels for cheap. Long‚Äëterm though, the consistency wasn‚Äôt there. Fine for casual shows but less so for live sports.

**5\. StreamHaven** ‚Äì Pricing is on the low side, which tempted me, but I think you get what you pay for: some buffering during busy evenings in the US and UK.

In the end, comparing these services is a bit like comparing coffee spots‚Äîyou think you‚Äôve found ‚Äúthe one,‚Äù then you stumble upon another that surprises you. My main takeaway is to test before committing, and keep an open mind since no IPTV setup stays perfect forever.",0,1758537841.0,evanston,2,0.25,False

I'm 5'11, light brown hair, dark blue eyes. I'm looking for somebody like minded to me, which is somebody that is a bit of a home body, likes staying in rather than going out to clubs. Somebody that likes going for a hike in nature rather than a shopping spree in a busy place.

I'm into psychology, religion, weightlifting, science and philosophy.

I have not watched TV in 20 years and rarely watch movies but wouldn't mind. I like to game but in moderation.

I'm very into nutrition and keeping fit, but I don't look like a bodybuilder or something, just a regular guy that tries and sometimes succeeds taking care of himself.

I've currently returned to college for a year, looking at management jobs.

I'm looking for somebody that is not focused on ambition or ""success"", that is content in life and does not feel that something is missing in them that they need to fix by validation from the outside world.

I'm very easy going and laidback, I love life, love to laugh and have fun and would not do well with people that are high strung, argumentative or that always needs to be occupying themselves in twenty different ways. If you're the kind of woman that is content just sipping a cup of coffee while reading a book, you would be perfect for me.

Overall I'm just looking for a quiet, happy and peaceful life, with as little drama as humanly possible.

On the toddler side of things we are all set, my wife is a pediatric nurse who also spent 5 years working in a nursery so from a health and safety, sensory, play perspective she knows it all. The area I'm stuck is with the cafe side of things,

I plan to only sell pre packaged foods to begin with so I can keep the food safety down to a minimum whilst we start up and get used to running the place, this will likely change in the future however Myself and my wife are tea drinkers (true Brits) so we know nothing about coffee. I'm not looking to be a competitor to Starbucks or Costa this needs to be a basic set up however a variety is always a plus, flat white, Americano, capachino, espresso (parents are tired a lot) where do I begin with these? What kit do I need? What perishables do I need? 

Any help and/or advice would be massively appreciated

If you already run/own/work in a place like this is it worthwhile? Or am I going to be pulling my hair out within a month?

1nniuei,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveAndDeepspace/comments/1nniuei/i_am_having_a_monumental_day_ngl_goa_trailer/,I am having a monumental day ngl ‚õÑüçéüêü(GoA trailer spoilers),"TL;DR: As a Zayne main, with a Caleb addiction and a newly minted Raf obsession, I had quite a day today. Girls I had palpitations. I unlocked Ebb and Flow, got Caleb's free card, and watched Zayne's trailer and immediately started theorycrafting. All of that, back to back, before my morning coffee. As back to back as MC and the God of Annihilation, lol. 

First, I am warming up to the fishie big time. I was mindin' my own business, doing my dailies and I just got Ebb and Flow. So at first I was like ""this is fishy (ha), if he's ill why is he pushing us away?"" But he was kinda leaning into our touch a little bit too hard RIGHT? 

Girlies. I plunged head first in mermaid mating season. üßúAnd I hadn't even had my breakfast yet.  ‚òï

And then he went ""Master"" WHAT ü´¢ May I just say I love Raf's MC. She's savage when she is teasing him but she's a üëë**Consent Queen** üëë when it matters. So I was also willing to let that whole ""do whatever you want"" thing slide, as Raf wasn't feeling like himself, but he was a-okay when he texted MC later and said it again! Oh no, it's *terrible* that you know my weaknesses, what if you *have your way with me*? Birb is not even subtle.    

So up next was Caleb's card. When MC got jealous of all the attention and threatened to lock him up I half expected him to go ""when you do it is okay, but when I --"" and then shut up because there were people around. Hahaha, I love how his MC is matching his freak. These babies deserve each other in every possible way. 

Then I logged in reddit and saw everybody freaking out about Zayne's myth and completely lost it. As a new player who does not own a single spicy card OH MY GOD. 

Theory time: the myth says there are hundreds of thousands of ""failures"" and only one chance to be happy. 

Me, a traumatised Zayne girlie: ‚ú® **SO THERE'S A CHANCE? ‚ú®**

Zayne got a little bit of a Dr. Steven Strange treatment, with the multiple futures, one chance, the portal opening, the hand jewelry (reminded me of Dr. Strange's hand surgery images). 

The myth also says that when love is carved into destiny, **the god will walk among mortals.** I think Zayne GoA will give up his immortality and godhood (aka become mortal) to get that chance, like how Dr. Strange sacrificed his life to get to the one future where the Avengers beat Thanos. I think this myth could be preceding the other two, and is probably ground zero, his ""original"" MC. I feel like giving up divinity is the theme for him, as Foreseer gave up his power/immortality, we don't know what happened to MoF but he probably did as well (otherwise Zayne wouldn't **reincarnate as a mortal**) and Main Timeline Zayne gave up his position as a doctor and tried to run away. Having power over life and death is his theme, and it fits with his main storyline personas, the doctor (life), the grim reaper (death).

I am warming up to his looks, ngl my first impression is that it didn't feel much like him  - he has always been more subtle, and his myths more emotional, but I'll reserve my final opinion till the myth releases. Damn if he isn't gorgeous with long hair though. I also hope he gets an ultimate like Xavier did, I will be disappointed if he doesn't, but I have a hunch that the blindfold scene will be a battle animation. Fingers crossed. **If he ruins his own 50/50 I'll scream.** I have enough to R0 him but not to R1 him, and I really want his tattered outfit. RNG gods please have mercy. Let me have him. üôè

Can we talk about the SPICE though. üßØüßØüßØ

I mean, he didn't even get spice for his bday. And in Foreseer he got a single kiss. MoF didn't even get that. 

**So the devs went, ""eh I guess they deserve some"" and by ""some"", they meant handing out heart attacks like they were paper napkins.** üöë

And it is so WELL DONE. \[screams\]

Just. Behold. Not just the spice, but the caresses. MY FAVORITE part was the light caresses. 

How he tried to shield her/cradle her during the fall? He did the same, cradled her head when they wiped out in the beach banner. The force field around them when they landed? Callback to his bday snow globe. THE SIGNS WERE THERE ALL ALONG.

Turns out the girlies who pinpointed the blindness/covering of eyes theme for him were SPOT ON.

Sorry if that's the case.

I started my coffee journey with a french press, but I soon found myself running my brew through a paper filter to get rid of the fines (I have a rather cheap grinder - a KINGrinder P2 - so I get a lot of them). I was also annoyed by the long time it took to brew and the cleanup, so I thought switching to pour over would be a good idea. Also, it looked fun! However, I found it rather intimidating - it seemed to me that it had little margin for error and I'd be brewing bad coffee for a while. The Hario Switch allowed for immersion brewing with the cleanness and ease of cleanup of filter and would allow me to experiment with percolation whenever I felt up for it. 

Now, as a newbie, it's difficult for me to tell if I'm brewing my coffee correctly and I just don't like it or if my pourover technique is off. I read that cupping would allow me to taste something rather representative of the coffee to what I could compare my experiments. 

This led me to the following questions:

- Would comparing my percolation cups to an immersion cup (french press/Hario Switch) be similar enough to comparing to a cupping cup? Wouldn't it be even better to compare my percolation cups to a Switch cup (as they'd both have been filtered)? 

- If immersion brewing is (roughly) letting coffee release flavour and aromatic compounds by immersing it in water until the water is saturated with those... why are there many different ""optimal"" immersion recipes? If I followed the french press recipe on my Switch-style brewer, would I get the same result than if I brewed on a french press and then ran it through a paper filter? Why is the recommended immersion time 2 minutes in the Clever Dripper recipe? 

- What about overextraction? If I understand correctly, the french press recipe calls for a brew time between 8 and 12 minutes (""the longer you wait, the better it'll taste""). Is immersion really that forgiving?

Thanks a lot in advance.

EDIT: maybe a weirder question: I generally like sweeter flavours more than acidic ones. Is there a way to test how sweet my coffee can be (like a cupping but tailored to sweetenes)? ",1,1758536966.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False

I only traded in these because I didn't want to get liquidated by a huge volatility in market out of nowhere. My capital was 80$.... A pretty small one you could say. In the first few days I traded I made some profit and losses but overall my capital reached 130$.... I was happy with it and was planning how I would have 500$ by the end if this month and in process like this I would probably be having 7-8k before the end if this year.... Unfortunately dreams are just dreams, I was using 100% of my capital and with a 10x leverage so I could make like 10-15% a day. But I didn't put stop loss at all because I thought why I need I am playing in choppy market and so I didn't put it up and I accidentally fall asleep one night when my trade was active and by the morning I woke up, instead of feeling the bitter taste of coffee..... I felt the bitter taste of sleeping so peacefully.... I lost about 70 dollars in just one trade from then on I thought I would close my trade whenever the price rich 20% of my capital in loss and I followed it for a couple of times and was in a loss and profit face but I was seeing that the price bounces back just after I take exit in loss, it's like market was just after me..... Sigh I am still thinking like that. Anyways it led me to believe I should remove it since price bounces back so I didn't put it up and this led to  a trade on 40% loss but since it was a weekend and crypto goes down so I did hold it for the weekend and just today the trade and crypto market suddenly dropped so much and I completely got liquidated, at the end of time I closed my 50% trade thinking I saved some capital but forgot that the trade was on cross mode and not in isolated so I lost completely because the sharp drop today was something I haven't seen since I started trading..... I have made some huge mistakes but they were worth it to make me learn something, I always thought lossing money just feels like heartache but it also feels like a teaching fees..... Now I am thinking that I should paper trade for a week, my strategy is that I should only invest 10% of my capital and risk it entirely either I am gonna win 10% more or loss that for the day and stop trading that day so I am only loosing 10% a day and my strategy will work but only in a choppy market I should avoid during high volume hours and should just stick with scalping and not just get liquidated my Entire capital.... If anyone has a better advice please I am open to all suggestions as long as that can make me a better trader.....",1,1758536827.0,Trading,6,1.0,False

Your boy would appreciate it!


Hello? ""The Silence"" (Chapters 1/3)
-

Chapter 1.
-
Nature, it is a beautiful and horrifying thing.
Be the rolling hills of sand in the deserts and by the sea. 
To the trees, rivers and mountains ranges that make up our forests and jungles. 
It's Beautiful for the view, the experiences and adventures. 
But also terrifying for the same reasons. During the day you can feel peaceful and relaxed, knowing everything around you is where it belongs, if it be the squirrels and chipmunks running around and climbing trees, to the birds singing they're songs and soaring the sky's above. 

You know they belong, you know what they are. You can hear them. You can smell them maybe. But you definitely bar none, can see them. 
And then as night falls, the same place that gave you peace and comfort. Now brings the unknown, the unsure, the unseen. Darkness is your only friend. Cause it's all you see, and all you know for sure is there. And what if you couldn't hear? Nothing at all. It Makes it all a hundred times worse. it's why I'm telling you this story, to know that when you go out in the woods. To not forgot, to say Hello while you're out there. 

So here we go. 
About a year and a half years ago, i sent an application in to the department of Wildlife Resource Management and got a one time job working at a remote observation cabin deep in the Game Lands of the Appalachia Mountains. 

It was a one year contract, just go to the cabin by myself, that'll be equipped with a radio to check in with my supervisor at a Ranger station not far from me, and walk around a 20 mile fenced in radius around the cabin, and simply take notes of what I see and make a daily report about my encounters. 
Take note of any and all animal activity, movements and numbers and what they are and report my finding to the Wildlife Resource Commission database through a computer at the cabin. I also had to keep an eye on local rivers, small creeks and ponds near by for anything that I'd have to notify the Forestry Services, about potential flash flood hazards and also of course looking for potential wild fires and get word back quickly. 

All that And be paid more than I've made in my two and a half years at my last job? 
Yeah I signed up faster than I could breathe and think. 

I grew up in the mountains and love being outdoors. I could hike extremely well and I was also med certified, could tie multiple knots and had taken a survival training course when I was young. it seemed like an easy job, and a way to get away from life at home. What bad could happen? 
After applying for the position, it was a week later and I heard back from the WRM and they said I got the job and asked when I could start

I said
""immediately if possible?""

They said it was deal and we scheduled my start date for the next morning, I was given an address to a Ranger station near where I'd be staying. 

The woman i spoke with told me 
""You'll need to meet with Ranger Richardson at 8am tomorrow morning for paperwork and a baggage check for contraband and non assigned items and""

 I interrupted her asking
""I have a question. What are and aren't things I can bring with me?"" 

Her response was, well.
 ""sir if you would have taken a chill pill and waited I was about to list them off, no need to rush me. so please be patient."" 

Feeling embarrassed, I replied. 
""oh sorry, jumped the gun I guess there.""
I laughed harder than I should have.

She responded seemingly annoyed with having to deal with me.
""well since you just mentioned it, all firearms and weapons are prohibited from being brought by in employees. There is to be absolutely no alcohol, no drugs allowed. All items such as toiletries and clothing and anything you wish to bring for entertainment is allowed. Food will be provided to you every 2 weeks. Water and power are available at the cabin. And you'll get daily check ins for any issues and well being."" 

So the don't bring with me list make sense, don't want any lonely people in the middle of nowhere drinking and possibly on drugs with a gun. Could cause any kinds of problems.

So after going over everything I needed to know for now. we hung up. I got to packing what I needed as fast as possible, took me about a good day and half to pack everything for a whole year, brought my favorite books and some puzzles to keep me busy when there's nothing to do. 
And bring at least a week worths of clothes and shoes for each season of the year. Easy list. 

It took awhile getting it all loaded up in my car, I took a final list of my things and went back in my house to make sure I wasn't forgetting anything. Since they wanted me there the next morning, I decided to drive there before it got dark and stay at a campground I found not far from the station.
From where I lived it was a good 6 hour drive to there, so thankfully I did happen to live not insanely far like states away, and it also helped that I liked to drive. After locking up the house and speaking with a neighbor about collecting my mail. I sent out and head for the campground. 

The drive there was uneventful and boring. But since I left town early enough I was able to stop in to a few places and just take in some views. About the only good thing that happened the whole time. 
I make it to the campground not long before dark, I found a tent only site so I didn't have check In with anyone. I set up camp for the night and eat a little dinner and take in some of the beautiful night sky. I get ready for to go to bed, and get a good nights sleep, And be ready for the new day to begin.

Chapter 2.
-

So I woke up the next morning early to get cleaned up and a little coffee in me before heading to meet with Ranger Richardson. 
Got my coffee and teeth brushed and a good shower to help get my engine running. 
Once I got dressed I packed away camp and cleaned my mess. Made sure everything was in the car and headed for the station. 
I pulled in about five minutes til 8am and was greeted by a gate guard. Who looked about as awake as a dead fish. I rolled my window down and he began his stick.

""Hi I'm Ranger Jonah Reese with the Pisgah National Park Rangers, I need to see an I.D. and to know your reason for being here""

He said all while barely holding his head up and eyes open. I handed him my I.D. And replied 

""Yeah I'm the new hire for one of the look out cabin, I was told to meet with Ranger Richardson for baggage check and paperwork.""  

He looked confused at my response but looked at my I.D. And when he handed it back to me he said

""Oh, okay. go ahead and park by Zone 4, good luck up out there, Don't forget to say, ""Hello"" out there.""

Before I could say anything he went back into his guard hut and shut the door. 

""Hmm, okay? That's a bit weird""

 I thought to myself but decided not to think too much into it. 

So I just went and found a spot where he said to go. Zone 4, spot 7. Got what I needed out and locked the car and went inside the station, the main door was unlocked and me assuming they knew I was coming and expected me. I didn't think to knock so I walked on in 

""Hello? New hire for one of."" 

before I could finish my sentence, a guy with undone pants, no shirt and no shoes, he looked half awake. He screams. 

""OH HEY DIDN'T YOUR MOMMA TEACH YOU TO KNOCK!"" 

Now much more awake than he first was. I screamed back. 

""OH MY GOD IM SORRY"" 

I said and Slamming the door behind me and stepping away to control myself from how awkward and not a good look I have now made. 
After a couple of minutes the same guy came out fully dressed except for his shoes, had them in his one hand and coffee in the other.
Me wanting to apologize and not be too embarrassed or awkward about what happened. I said. 

""Hey I'm sorry for just barging on in there, I thought it was just an office room or welcome area in there. Didn't think anyone would be there well...like that."" 

He sits down at a picnic table just outside the station. 
He lights up a cigarette and after taking a drag. 
He gave me a still just waking up dead stare, not to amused. He starts to talk and says. 

""Knock before you enter, any where. I'm at least glad you made sure to say ""Hello,"" get use to that out here and don't forget it. and you also started explaining yourself, if not for that I probably would have come at you and lord knows how that would have went. No offense just think next time. 
I haven't introduced myself yet, I'm Ranger Josh Richardson, Second in command here at OutPost Chance of the Pisgah National Park. Pleased to meet you Uhh?"" 

""Oh, I'm Alex. Pleased to meet you Josh. You're the Ranger Richardson, the one I'm supposed to meet with?""

He finished putting his boots on, and taking another sip of coffee. 

""No that'll be my Father, John ""Rich"" Richardson, he was on the phone with the folks at Headquarters about a fire in the next county over"" him getting another sip of coffee, and lighting up a cigarette. ""He'll be off soon, it's a fire that we shouldn't have to deal with, but we still need to get heads up just in case."" 

Taking a drag off of his cigarette and looking me up and down. 

""What made you wanna come out here? Why this job?"" 

I was kinda confused when he asked me this, I'm a little small compared to some dudes but I didn't look like no city boy gone country. 

""I grew up around woods my whole life and I needed some time away from normal life you know. And the pay didn't seem to bad either so I just figured why not. Why do you ask?"" 

Him looking at the ground and took a drag off his cigarette, followed by him finishing his coffee. He then says. 

""Just didn't seem the type, no offense."" 

I put on a good fake smile and a nod 

""None taken, I get that a lot. But I can handle myself well enough out here, or at least we'll see for sure."" 

He looked at me like I was the silliest and most naive kid he'd ever seen. 

""Yeah we'll see bud."" 

After a few minutes of chit chat with Josh, Ranger Richardson came out the door, tall, hero looking official type with a nice and clean Cowboy hat on to boot and he looked at and said to Josh

""Jesus boy could have you kept down a little bit earlier! Interrupted my call with Sam! And who are you young man."" 

Did anyone know I was coming? Ehh. They Must of forgot. 
But Josh responded before I could 

""This little Turd is the reason I screamed, this is the new hire for Cabin 12, didn't knock on the door and came right on in. Thanks for mentioning he was coming pops."" 

Ranger Richardson giving Josh a stare only a dad could give his son. And than looked to him and said. 

""Well I wasn't expecting to be on the phone and wasn't excepting you to be up before he got here. So Hush your lip up boy before I remind that you're here because of me and can leave here because of me."" 

Than he turned towards me and put a nice, warm smile on his face. 

""And sorry for not meeting you first. Next County over noticed a small Wild fire starting about 2 miles from our County lines. Should be dealt with by the other Counties stations, but we still needed to be notified. 
Ranger Johnathan Richardson Head of Outpost Chance and The Pisgah National Park. Pleased to meet you Alex."" 

He stuck he's hand out for a shake and I did mine, almost broke my hand while shaking it and you could tell this man has been in the woods most his life. Definitely not no soft hands. He let my hand go and He waved to me to follow him and said.

""Come on inside and let's get a coffee and go over something's in there. And while we're talking inside, care if Josh checks all your things you plan to bring for anything you shouldn't have and get them out of your car for you?"" 

Me following him and responding. 

""Yeah that's fine, everything is in the trunk and anything in the back seats forward can stay in the car, here's the key."" 

Handing the key to Josh and following Ranger Richardson. He looks to Josh and says

""be careful with his stuff boy, and make sure you load it on the cart properly, weight in the front, got it? And no judgment of their things"" 

Josh looking back at him and said

""If I find a dildo or anything along those lines, I'm gonna make a joke about it."" 

I looked to Josh and said 

""I have a count on them all, so I'll know if one's missing."" 

Ranger Richardson began laughing and still walking to the station, he opened the door for me and we both walk inside. 
He pours me a cup of coffee and we sit down to talk the job and safety precautions. 
We talked for a little over an hour about the normal routine and routes I'll take to scout my section. And going over everything I'll be provided for the cabin and myself. The every 2 week food drop offs, I can make requests for certain things each drop off for the next one. And what equipment I should expect when I get there. 

""The radio is your most important and valuable tool out there. You'll have multiple batteries and a rechargeable one with charger, if you lose it you can't get ahold of us if you get lost or hurt. So keep it on you."" 

He held out a decent size military looking hand radio with a long antenna and a strap for putting around your hand. And a little piece of paper with all channels and contacts. 

""And A computer is at the cabin to type your daily field reports, and send them back to headquarters and respond to messages from other outpost and stations. There are a couple of older games on everyone's computer so if you get bored you'll have that mess with. And anything else, flash lights, matches and lighters. Cooking stuff and everything else needed will be in the cabin for you. Any questions or concerns so far?"" 

Knowing I had majority of my main things with me, and that'll I'll have food and water and majority of what I need, I did think to ask one thing.

""Is there anything to protect myself with at the cabin? Like even just bear spray?"" 

Ranger Richardson chuckled deeply and nodded 

""Yes you'll have a few things, you'll have a knife, main thing we issue for protection. They're be an Axe and a Machete for clearing debris of of trails and other things like that. And the last resort and you have to call in for it. There's pump action 12g in a safe with enough shells to keep you alive against 3 or 4 bears, but no one has ever needed to call in for the code. But you at least have a couple of things and you're welcome to set them up for your needs. Any other questions?"" 

Only could think of one other question. 

""Yes, what's so important about saying hello? Both Jonah and Josh mentioned.""

before I could even finish, Ranger Richardson slammed his hand on the table and looked me dead in the eyes.

""Just do it. No matter what. Whenever you enter somewhere, always say hello. Just do it and don't forget it."" 

He narrowed his eyes looking at me and said in a stern voice.

""Do I make myself clear Son?"" 

I probably for once this whole time showed a little nervousness and maybe even some fear, but I responded. 

""Yes sir, crystal clear. understood."" 

He lightens up a bit and puts back on a warm smile. 

""Good deal. Now let's go see how Josh is coming along with your bag check and get you headed on your way, long walk ahead for you."" 

We walk outside and Josh is at the table we sat at earlier, he's finishing my last bag and getting it loaded on to a little pull behind cart. Ranger Richardson looked at me and said

""watch this"" 
and asked Josh. 

""Boy are you done inspecting his things and got him loaded and ready to go? Or do I need to kick you in your ass a little to get done faster?"" 

He laughed a little and Josh laughed as well and responded 

""Yeah his cart is loaded and good to go, and everything he brought was good and approved. Nothing he shouldn't have or makes me question him."" 

Ranger Richardson chuckled and smiled at him. 

""Good deal, now go get yourself to work on something else and I'll send him off."" 

Josh walked away and went back inside the station. 

Ranger Richardson hands me a map and a compass. And begins to explain my trip ahead. 

""You'll follow this trail here until you get to this fork, take the left and keep going for about 7 miles. Once you pass a decent size creek with a small bridge, you're almost there. Remember, Radio in if you need anything or have a question about something. Report anything of interest or concern. Understood?"" 

I nodded and took the radio and map from him and began getting my stuff ready.

""Thank you for the introduction and advice Ranger Richardson."" 

He got a harsh look on his face, but slowly turned into a smirk. 

""That's Rich son, no need to be to be to formal with me."" 

""Yessir Mr Rich. sorry, can't take my manners out of me."" 

He shook my hand and gave me a nod.

""All good son, good luck. And remember, say Hello out there.""

I reply 

""Yes Sir"" 

We stoped shaking hands and say our byes for now. And I head off to the cabin. To start my yard adventure. Or what I thought was an adventure. Only turned into a nightmare. 

End of Chapter 2.

Chapter 3.
-
I set out and got on my journey to the cabin. The pull along cart I was given is not the greatest. Not a great handle to hold to and pull with.
But it at least has big wheels for a cart and isn't awkward to pull. It's heavy but that's what I get for having a year's of stuff on it. But thankfully the trail itself is, for the most part fairly flat and smooth. nothing the cart has had trouble with yet.

From the start of the Ranger Station to the Cabin. 
I had a good 5 or so hour hike ahead. I'd get to see a bit of the area I'd be taking care of and keeping a look out on. So a nice first introduction here. 
Passed several of the small creeks Mr Rich told me about, stopped and took a few small notes, noticeable rocks and trees for land marks. and how the water was flowing and that I noticed a few small animals drinking out of it. Nothing out of the ordinary for being in the woods.

After about two hours I had to stop and take a break. Pulling the cart was taking its toll on me and my legs were reminding me of my last two and a half years sitting in a chair for work. 
So I get a little bit of food to snack on out of one of the bags I had in my cart. And also i grab a thermos with water out to get something to sip on.

Took some drinks of water and took some bites of my candy bar and just enjoyed the view.
Taking in the sights around me and hearing the wonderful noises of nature in its own world. I write down some notes and that's when I noticed something odd. 
For awhile I heard all the normal sounds of the woods. 
Wind blowing, trees moving and birds singing and animals running around. 

As I'm sitting there eating and reading
notes. 
I notice, that very slowly. It started getting eerily quiet, birds stopped singing. All the little animals stopped running. And then I could hear nothing at all. Not even the water moving anymore. 
But then out of nowhere, I could faintly hear something. It softly and quietly moving through the air. 
Getting closer and closer to me. Until it basically was next to my ear. A very gentle. 

""Hello"" 
 
I think to myself. 
""I'm hearing things. there's no way I actually just heard, especially not right at my ear."" 

Then I remembered. I didn't say hello before I got to this area, So I did what I was told. 

""Hello? Sorry I didn't say that before getting here. New around here."" 

And after I finished speaking. 

just as gentle and slowly as everything got quiet. Everything around me started making noise again. Wind blowing, Water roaring, Birds singing and squirrels barking. All was well. 
After that I figured it was time to be on my way. And said to myself. 

""Okay, I actually have to make sure I remember to say Hello anytime I go somewhere new. Apparently something out there needs to hear it."" 

 So I Finish up my candy bar and called it for my break, my legs felt good to start to walk again. And after I make sure to pick and pack up my trash. I confirmed with my map and compass that I was heading the right direction. I carried on for the rest of the 2 and half hours til the Cabin. Not long and far from it now. 

I got to the cabin a little before night fall. The sun was barely shining, just enough for me to make an out small but picture perfect log cabin, like something you'd see on a post card. Cute and relaxing looking. 
Trees covering the whole top canopy above the cabin, a nice and clean walk way going towards the Cabin. Birds and animals doing their things. Wind and water rushing and flowing by, giving my ears sweet nothings to listen to. It was simply perfect. 
I pull my cart up to the door and begin to look for a lock box Mr Rich told me the key would be in.

""Should be around back, I think that's what Rich said?""

Walked to the back of the cabin and found hanging under one of the legs supporting the foundation. got it out and went back around to the front of the cabin, put the key in the door and as I'm unlocking the door, it happens again. 
Slow silence starts creeping in. 
Birds stop singing, animals quit running. Then I remembered. 

""Hello out there!"" 

And back came the sounds and movements of the woods. 

""Why does this keep happening? What's doing it? Only time will tell I guess.""

I unlocked the door and open it, dust flies every inside, filling up the room with a cloud of haze. being clearly seen by what's left of the sun light coming through the windows, obviously this cabin hasn't seen a person in quite sometime, so I start to walk inside and say 

""Hello, I'm New here! I'll be staying here for awhile, hope that's okay?"" 

Nothing happens like it has before. So maybe my first ""Hello"" outside was enough? Wasn't sure but after the last two things happened without saying Hello, I didn't wanna take any chances. Better safe than sorry. 

I unload my cart of my things and bring them all inside and started to get settled in and acquainted with everything inside. The computer, try to figure out how the oven here worked. it was an older one that most of the nobs were worn out and I couldn't tell what was temp and what was a timer. 

The bathroom was definitely not as I expected. It a had a shower with running water, but the toilet was just an outhouse style wooden seat and a hole through it going into a massive hole below, not much of a smell since the last time anyone's stayed here. So that was nice. 

After getting set up and my things put in drawers and closet. It was dark out so I decided to go ahead and report to Mr Rich and write my findings of today down in the computer logs. 
Got the radio and called in for Rich 

""This is Cabin 12 to Outpost Chance, This is Cabin 12 to Outpost Chance. Anyone Copy?"" 

After a few moments Josh responded.

""This is Ranger Josh with Outpost Chance.  
You make it to the cabin? Over.""

""Yes I just got settled in. Over.""

""Good. Glad to hear you made it safe and sound, what do you think of everything out there Alex? Over.?

""So far so good, it's gorgeous. Beautiful views and plenty of new things to see and do. The cabin is nice, a little bit more rustic than what your dad made me seem to have except. But it's home now. So I'll make the best of it. Over."" 

He responded after a moment. 
""Good to hear, yeah they are pretty run down and need to be updated. But it's a roof over your head. How did the walk there go? Over.""

Since Rich had told me to report anything that happenes while I'm out here, but also said not to talk about why we say ""Hello"". what do I say? How do I ask why the entire woods went quiet, only to hear a faint ""Hello"" like a breeze of wind. I needed to know something. So I told him. 

""Well on my way here, I stopped about half way to take a break for a min""

Before could even finish my sentence, Josh interrupted me. 

""Did you make sure to, well you know?"" 

Knowing he knew what I was about to say, no need to beat around the bush. 

""Not at first, I sat down and ate a snack for a minute, everything out around me slowly and carefully went absolutely deafening quiet. Than I could have sworn I heard the faintest ""hello"" right by my ear, I said it back after that and everything went back to normal. 
And Basically the same thing started to happen when I first got to the cabin, I remembered before it got too quiet. What's the deal with"" 

He interrupted me once again, a more serious tone to him than he has before in his voice.

""Make sure, and I mean make 100% sure you say it! do it everytime you go somewhere in your zone. no matter what. Just do it and trust me, okay? Over.  

Not sure I really did, but what other choice do I have?. 

""Okay, I trust you and will keep doing it. 
But Besides that the walk and the woods on the way here were uneventful and nothing out of the ordinary. How Copy. Over?"" 

""Soild copy 12, have you filled out your field report yet? And is everything in the cabin working? Power and water turned on? And the fridge and oven running like they should or do we gotta call in for repairs? Over."" 

""No everything seems to be on and running fine. The oven is a bit tricky to work but I'll figure it out. I'll get on my report in just a minute and have sent out before bed. How Copy, over?"" 

""Copy. And hey, knock it off with the extra Radio Sling BS, no need for that. But sounds good. Radio in if you need anything or something happens. If it wasn't mentioned, try to at some point in the night to get up and just take a quick peak outside. The fire over by the County line just crossed into our side. Wasn't supposed to, but that's Wild Fires for ya. Over."" 

""Can do. I'll set an alarm on my phone for about 3 hours from now. I'll Radio in if it's important. Over."" 

""Sounds good. I'm signing off for the night. Sleep well and stay safe. Josh out."" 

""Night Josh, Alex out.""

I turned the radio off and went on the computer to fill my report out. Grabbed some food to munch on while typing.
I obviously left out the silence and the voice I heard out of my report. But put down everything I wrote on the way as my first notes and observations. Submitted to the main board and then to Rich's email. With that out of the way. I decided I'd check out the games on the computer. 

One is Tetris. Not surprised there. And then two card games. Spider Solitaire and Texas Hold 'em. Better then nothing I suppose. 
I play poker for a while and get lost in it and also listening to music on my phone while playing. After sometime of me playing the games and listening to music. without a warning like it did before.

It goes silent. Just Absolute quiet. 

No music on my phone. Nothing outside. I couldn't even hear myself breathing.
Just pure. Silence. 

And expecting to hear a normal hello like before, it didn't come. but what did come. put fear into me like never before. 

Multiple loud knocks at the door...

Followed by a deep, and gentle...

""Hello?""
