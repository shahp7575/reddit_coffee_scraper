“My Word is My Truth”


These are the words left to us by *(decedant)*, 91, who passed away on April 9, 2025, surrounded by loved ones and close friends.


A long-time resident of (place),*(decedant)* was born to (parents), in (place), where he graduated from (place) High School.


A lover of words, (decedant) was well-read in philosophy, religion, classic literature and poetry, and always enjoyed lively and spirited discussions of these. 


He wrote prose and composed poetry about a variety of topics, and if you were fortunate, one of those compositions  was a letter to you.


Always a deep thinker, with a kind, open-minded curiousity about the human condition, (decedant) kept a daily journal for decades. 


(Decedant) held all the natural world in reverence. He spent much of his youth working for Mr. (person) on a neighboring farm, where he learned intimately about plants and animals and the cycles of nature. It was during this period in his life that he first fell in love with the (Place) Mountains, while on a field trip with his Boy Scout troop.


After high school, he proudly served his country in the US Army, working as a Crytographer during the Korean conflict.


(Decedant) was an inquisitive man, who enjoyed life and learning in all its forms.  After his discharge from the armed services,  he held a variety of  positions, including as a Fire Tower Steward on Mt. (place) for the US Forestry Service, and as a handler-trainer for a civilian company, supplying specially-trained dogs to the US military, all while earning a B.A. in English from (University).


He ultimately retired from working life as an analyst for (employer).


In later years, (decedant) could often be found in one of several (local) coffee shops, meeting up with old friends and making new ones. He loved and was beloved by just about anyone he ever met.


As he often said, when pouring a bit of his favorite bourbon: “It’s five o’clock somewhere…”, so raise your glass with us to toast this remarkable man, and wish him well on the next leg of his journey.

1k0wwk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k0wwk8/the_games_i_used_to_play_part_3/,The Games I Used to Play (Part 3),"The last time I posted on here  I asked myself what would have happened if I had finished counting all the way to zero.



Now I know.



If you have no idea what I’m talking about you can catch up on my situation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jtwmwo/the_games_i_used_to_play/). 



For those of you who are all caught up, I’m going to pick up right where I left off.



A few nights after I called my mom and asked about my childhood games Adrienne told me that she would be going out with a few girlfriends.



Honestly, when she told me this, I was conflicted. On one hand, with the house to myself I *could* do whatever I wanted. Which, of course meant that I could play any game. On the other hand, I was fucking terrified.



When Adrienne left for the night, it was the first time that I was completely alone in our new house. It wasn’t long before the silence began to drive me mad. With each passing minute I grew more paranoid.



The more I thought about it, the more I realized I didn’t entirely buy my mother’s story. 



She was hiding something from me - that much I was certain of. I considered calling her again and confronting her, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. *If* I was somehow wrong, I couldn’t bear to break her heart with my distrust. It wouldn’t be fair to her after all she had done for me. 



I stared down the creaky flight of wooden stairs into a lightless void. My heart raced as I thought about the monster waiting for me down there. It suddenly became incredibly difficult to breathe. I had played hundreds of games with the monster when I was a kid and not once did I experience a fear so petrifying. 



It seemed so normal to me at the time. The monster was just a part of the games. I never thought of him as anything more than that.



That night I never worked up the courage to descend the first step.



Instead, I stayed in the protective light of my kitchen, making sure to flip hall lights on both sides for maximum security. I avoided looking out the window into our backyard. The less ammunition I gave my brain to play tricks on itself the better.



I sat at the kitchen table and scrolled for hours. Instagram, Twitter, Reddit - anything to keep my mind off of the isolation I was confined to. 



About an hour into my scrolling, I began to hear noises coming from the basement. The sounds started innocently enough, something that could easily be mistaken for the gentle rattle of pipes settling in an old house. Then came rustling. It sounded like a raccoon, or other small animal had gotten loose down there and was knocking over cans and crawling into boxes.



I glanced up from my phone a few times to keep an eye on the door, but I knew that I needed to pretend I was uninterested. I didn’t need to play. I wouldn’t be a part of the monster’s games.



The sound became harder to ignore when the rustling turned to whispers. I couldn’t discern any specific words that were being uttered, but the imitation of the human voice was unmistakable. The vibrations carried themselves up, through the walls and through the tile floor of the kitchen.



Someone or something was down there.



But I already knew that.



I quickly unlocked my phone and opened my favorite contacts. I stared at Adrienne’s name, my heart damn near about to beat out of my chest. Her name sat above “Mom” as the only two in the short list.



Before clicking on her name I glanced at the clock. It was only 9:24 PM. She would be out with her girlfriends partying it up at the local bars well into the AM. I couldn’t do this to her. 



Instead, I lowered my phone to my side, and I cried. I can’t say for sure why. Call it exhaustion, loneliness, or fear. It doesn’t matter to me. But I do know that the monster broke me that night. 



And it did so without me even playing its games.



When I eventually crawled into bed I knew that sleep wouldn’t come easily. Hell, I’ll admit that I put on that damn British regency era romance show without a sleep timer. The light and sound did little to calm my nerves. I was smart enough to know that the television had all the same defensive properties as my comforter that I tucked myself into.



I pretended to be asleep in bed long enough to feel a numbness take over my body. My fear only subsided when Adrienne finally came home for the night. She tiptoed into our room, careful not to wake me. She crawled into bed next to me, and finally, feeling the comforting weight of her body next to mine, I was able to drift off into a dreamless sleep.



When I woke in the morning I wasn’t surprised that Adrienne was already up and out of bed. The TV was still on so I powered it off before I made my way to the kitchen, hoping that she had already started a pot of coffee. Typically, I avoid consuming caffeine but I was going to need all the help I could get if I wanted to make any real progress on cleaning up the backyard.



Stumbling into the kitchen, I saw Adrienne enter the front door wearing the same outfit she had gone out in last night.



When she saw my hair she laughed to herself. “And I thought I was the only one who had a long night.”  



I wiped the grogginess from my eyes before I responded.



“What were you doing on the porch? And why haven’t you changed?”



Adrienne cocked her head to the side.



“I tried to call you a hundred times. Jane got too wasted to drive so I had to crash at Dana’s last night. I’m just getting home now.”



The blood in my veins turned to ice.



Something had crawled into my bed last night. I heard it breathing. I felt its weight beside me. We were inches apart in the total darkness of my room. The thought made it feel like a hundred different bugs were crawling all over my skin. 



Luckily, Adrienne didn’t seem to notice my change in demeanor as she excused herself to shower. I sat down on the couch in our unpacked living room and covered my mouth with my hand.



The monster was getting too comfortable. I didn’t know what it wanted from me, but it had to know that I was terrified.



My first instinct was to get out of the house, but I couldn’t run forever. Even if I made the drastic decision to pack up and move, I knew that the monster would follow me wherever I went. 



I talked through my options with myself on the couch. I know that may sound weird, but I needed someone to bounce ideas off of and I’ve always found talking to myself to be helpful with problem solving.



By the end of the conversation, I had come to a grave and terrifying conclusion. I needed answers. And I knew exactly where I would find them. They would be waiting for me in the corner of my pitch black basement. They would come into light when I finished counting back from one hundred.



Before I knew it night had fallen upon the house and the day had slipped away from me. I wondered where the time went, but the reality was it didn’t even matter. I wasn’t in the right headspace to be doing housework.



As I lay in bed next to Adrienne I considered telling her everything. I was about to do something incredibly stupid that had a very real chance of getting her hurt. At the end of the day, I decided against it.



I didn’t know what my monster wanted, but it seemed way more interested in me than it was in Adrienne. It was my battle and I couldn’t get her involved. She came into my life when I was at my lowest point and she had shown me what true happiness was. For that, I will always be grateful. I love you, Adrienne.



When I was sure that my fiancé was asleep I kicked my feet out of bed silently. My toes pushed onto the scratchy carpet as I took my first few steps towards my bedroom door. We had only lived in the new house for a few days, yet I was already beginning to understand how to navigate it in the dark. 



To guide me, I let my right hand trace the wall, my fingers bobbing up and down against the drywall. I turned when I reached the kitchen. The door to the basement was already open, inviting me downstairs.



Had I left it open? I couldn’t remember.



The basement was silent. There was no rustle or whisper because the monster knew that I was coming. There was no need for an invitation.



I took a steadying breath and began my descent down the creaky wooden steps. I moved slowly and quietly as I forced myself to remain brave. The only reason I had won so many of the monster’s games when I was a child was because of my naïve courage. As an adult, I had finally come to understand fear’s true meaning.



Fear was understanding everything that you had to lose. 



Bravery was fighting to keep it, in spite of that fear.



As my bare foot kissed the cool concrete of the basement floor I pushed forward into the darkness. I would fight for Adrienne. I would fight for my mom. And I would fight for myself.



Before I began the countdown I switched on the basement’s singular fluorescent bulb. 



As I expected, the room was a mess of boxes and bags filled to the brim with decorations. Slowly, I slid mountains of cardboard out of the way, clearing my path to the corner. I was hundreds of miles away from the house where I first played the countdown game. The corner would be different, but the game would be the same.



As I bent over to lift the last remaining box I paused as I read the label taped on top.



“MARK - CHILDHOOD”



Instantly, I knew I had to open it. If there was any chance I could make it through the night without playing the countdown game, I would take it.



I rifled through old report cards and participation trophies. The box was dense, packed with various random trinkets and arts and crafts projects that I had acquired when I was young. Somehow, I had fond memories of none of them.



Just as I was about to give up my hunt, something in the disorganized box caught my eye. At first I thought it must have been packed in the wrong box.



It was an aged yellow folder with Adrienne’s name on it.



I opened the folder and found a stack of pages, identical in layout, each dated around twenty years ago.



Two names framed the header of each page.



*Adrienne, D. Morgan LCSW*



*Patient: Mark Cadello*



“What the fuck?” I whispered to myself.



I continued to skim the notes on each page using the light of the flickering fluorescent bulb. 



One read: “*Mark displays a pension for the imagination. He speaks of playing “games” with his imaginary friend. His social skills are steadily improving, although he still refuses to look me in the eye. I hope that he can continue to do well in school and befriend peers of his own age.”*



Another: “*Mark’s mood was sour today. I can’t blame him, Deborah mentioned that she had been admitted to the hospital again leaving no one to look after Mark while she was being held. Progress with his condition seems to have regressed. When I speak to him, his mind is elsewhere. Today he told me that his “friend” had instructed him to ignore me. I believe that he trusts his imaginary friend more than I.”*



The notes were all similar in tone, until the last.



It read: *“I believe that I have finally made a breakthrough with Mark. He struggles with discerning reality from fiction, but he is a brilliant and calculating child. Today I tapped into that potential by asking him to count back from one hundred, pausing for exactly one second between each number. I asked him to close his eyes and focus on himself, and when he finally opened them, he could be sure his surroundings were genuine. It worked flawlessly and afterwards we had our most authentic and raw conversation yet. I truly believe that this is the wind in our sails that Mark needed.”*



I dropped the papers to the floor. Goosebumps had crawled over my flesh long before I finished reading. Panicked, I unlocked my phone and opened my messages. 



There were no saved texts between myself and Adrienne. No recent calls or voicemails.



When I opened my photos, I could not find a single image of my fiancé. Places that I had sworn we had visited together she was absent from. My breathing grew heavy.



It was then when I noticed a dozen missed calls from my mom and a single voicemail. I steadied myself before pressing play.



“*Mark. Hey, it’s me. I know you’re probably mad at me right now and I get it. I shouldn’t have hidden anything from you.”*



She paused.



*“But I called Adrienne. She told me that you hadn’t gone to see her in over three years. I’m worried about you. Shit, Mark. I’m worried because I know that the games are real. I used to play them too. Mysteriously waking up at 3:17 AM. The hand over the side of the bed. Waiting till he was right behind you to sprint up the stairs. Mark, I’ve played with the monster too. That was before I understood. I wanted to keep you ignorant and happy, but I see that that was wrong of me. I should have trusted you with the truth. I know what you are going through, and I can help. I- You shouldn’t be alone right now. I'll be over as soon as I can. Hang in there baby. I love you.”*



When I tried to call back, it went straight to voicemail.



Shadows danced around me as my head began to spin. I turned to race out of the basement. I would wait on the porch until my mom arrived if I had to. But when I looked up from the bottom of the basement stairs I saw that the kitchen door had been shut. 



I sprinted to the top and tried the door. It wouldn’t budge. I slammed my fist against the wood over and over.



“Adrienne! Adrienne! Please, let me out!” 



I could only describe what I had been feeling at that moment as nightmarish. Or perhaps more accurately, it felt like those few dreadful moments after waking from a nightmare - disorienting and terrifying. Expect the moments never ended.



I kept waking to form new realizations and new horrible realities. My sense of truth had been so distorted and mangled that I didn’t know what to believe.



“You know what to do.” A voice responded from the other side of the door. It was so quiet that I wasn’t even sure that I heard it.



“No. I won’t play. I don’t want to!” I screamed back.



The entire house began to shake and a piercing sound cut into my ears.



“Then how will you ever know what is real?”



The voice spoke directly into my mind.



“Make it stop!” I cried, covering my ears.



I stumbled back down the steps. When I reached the base I staggered into the cement wall, sending a pile of boxes crashing to the ground. The entire basement had come alive. Everything moved. Everything spoke. And I just wanted it to stop.



I yanked the chain to turn off the light with so much force I nearly ripped it from its socket. 



“Okay! You win! I’ll play!”



As if in response to my exclamation, the sounds and chaos around me began to calm. It didn’t take long before there was only darkness and silence.



With my legs shaking, I made my way to the corner of the basement that I had cleared. I lowered myself to the ground, feeling the cool concrete on the sides of my calves as I crossed my legs.



Drawing in a steadying breath, I closed my eyes. And I began to count.



“One hundred. Ninety-Nine. Ninety-Eight.”



I didn’t even need to focus to ensure exactly a second passed between each number. It came as naturally to me as riding a bike.



“Eighty-Seven. Eighty-Six.”



I avoided thinking about the monster, about Adrienne, and about my mother. I focused on myself, alone in the dark basement.



“Seventy-One. Seventy. Sixty-Nine.”



With each second that I drew closer to zero, I saw the light at the end of the tunnel growing warmer. I had to play, I had to win.



“Fifty-Two. Fifty-One. Fifty.”



Halfway.



“Thirty-Eight. Thirty-Seven.”



All at once my repressed memories bubbled to the surface. I remembered the look in my mom’s eyes when I asked her if I wanted to play. I remember seeing Adrienne, my therapist the day before.



“Twenty-Six. Twenty-Five”



I feel something begin to swirl around me. It could hardly be called a touch. Still, I refuse to open my eyes.



“Nineteen. Eighteen.”



The monster draws near. I know that it's smiling. It’s salivating at the idea of me reaching zero.



“Seven. Six.”



My only thought is winning. 



“Five. Four. Three.”



When I get to zero I’ll be safe because I will finally be able to trust my eyes. I will know that what surrounds me is real.



“Two.”



I love you Adrienne. I hope that the woman that I know is waiting for me on the other side.



“One.”



I’m sorry mom, but I had to know. I needed the truth.



“Zero.”



I open my eyes. I am still facing  the corner of my basement, surrounded by shadow.



When I turn around I know he’s there. My monster, lurking in the darkness, ready to face me.



“I won.” I say into the void.

June 4
>!Before I kill myself, I will tidy my room.!<
Not for symbolism. Not for closure.
Just because there’s a smell in here I can’t place, and I’d hate for someone else to have to figure it out. Some poor soul in rubber gloves, squinting at rotting banana skins and empty ramen cups, trying to figure out what part of the decay was me.
That would be rude. I’d rather spare them the puzzle.

I’ll wear a good pair of socks.
Thick ones, with no holes. I’ll warm them on the radiator first.
Then a good dinner. Something that takes time to make.
Maybe spaghetti, the kind that sticks to the wall when it’s done. Maybe a curry. A furious one that ruins the saucepan.
Something with steam that fills the flat like company. I will not need to worry about the morning after, but it does not feel right to die without a spare roll of toilet paper in the cupboard.

I will feel love. Anyone’s. Doesn’t have to be mine.
Just enough to remind me the stuff exists.
I’ll watch someone holding someone else too tightly on a park bench.
I’ll walk past an open window and hear laughter, and pretend it’s because of me.
I’ll watch Apollo 13 again, and pretend I’m floating too.
Pretend the air’s running out.
Pretend the silence is holy.

I’ll kiss someone—anyone—terribly.
Mouth too open, too wet.
Shakily, panicked. One that leaves us both feeling slightly ashamed.
Then I’ll fly a kite in the rain. Let it get stuck in a tree.
Scream up at it like a madman. Laugh till my ribs ache.

I’ll dance badly.
In my room. Shirtless.
To Bowie. Maybe Moonage Daydream.
I’ll jump on the bed like a child or a lunatic.
Whichever looks more free. 

I’ll run the bath too hot.
Steam the mirrors until I disappear.
Lower myself in slow, like a baptism.
Close my eyes and try to forget where I end and the water begins.

And then—because the universe loves me, maybe—
I’ll find something else to do before I kick the chair.

I’ll take a pen and write down everything I still don’t understand:
Why my heart stutters when someone says my name just right.
Why the sky bleeds like it has something to apologize for.
Why my plants keep dying.
Why I still check my phone.

But when the list gets too long,
I’ll put the pen down.
Eat dessert first.
Ice cream out the tub.
Fingers instead of a spoon.

And then—because it will be late—
I’ll go to bed.

June 6

Feeling hopeful.
Didn’t act on it.
Laid like a couch potato, comatose, on the old chaise longue. 
Not quite asleep; existing like soup left on the stove too long. Thickening, gurgling, growing a skin.
 I Let the sun rot me gently through the window.
Ate lunch in the garden- tasted like metal.
The pipes are creaking. 

June 7

I think I dreamt of teeth.
They fell from the sky like hailstones.
Everyone else just carried on.
Laughing, chatting, umbrellas up, as if nothing strange was happening.
As if teeth didn’t bounce off the pavement and rattle against their coats.
I tried to catch them.
Scooping handfuls, trying to find one that looked familiar.
There was blood, but only in my hands.
I woke up confused and bleeding slightly—small crescent moons dug into my skin from my own fingernails.
I’d been clenching my fists in sleep again.
Trying to hold onto something.
Even now, I’m not sure what.
Jaw was aching too.
Tongue running obsessively over every tooth, like I was counting prisoners.

In other news, I think I have mice. Tiny bastards. Could be the smell. Could be me.

June 17

Woke up on the floor again.
Curled fetal in the centre of the carpet like a question mark with no sentence.
The room is grey. The weather is worse.
The cheap navy blackout curtains betray their name—
pale pinprick shafts of light worm through the draped fabric,
illuminating the wall in speckled dust.
They faintly resemble stars.

I was sick in the night.
Didn’t get up in time.
It sits on my chest like a bad, wet cat.
Warm in the wrong ways.
Heavy in the right ones. It stinks.

It has been a bad week.
Hell, a bad year, but the days all feel the same now.
Maybe it is still yesterday.

June 18
Cleaned up. Opened a window to air out the house a little. Still stinks. There was no breeze.
Still, the curtains moved.

June 20

I didn’t sleep last night. Not in the real way. I lay down. I closed my eyes. But I stayed awake through all of it.
The dreams still come while I’m conscious. They crawl in under the door like smoke. This time, someone singing in the hallway—low, lilting, out of key. The tune was nothing I recognised, and yet I knew the words. Every syllable. Not as weird as the one with the teeth.

Then the kettle boiled.

Not in the middle of the night. No. At 07:04 exactly.
I heard the switch click down.
That familiar whoosh of heating coils.
The screeching hiss of the water building to steam.

I hadn’t moved. I hadn’t touched it. I hadn’t made tea in two days.

I stood in the doorway and watched it, backlit by the early sun. The kitchen looked almost beautiful in that moment, almost holy. Dust motes hovered like they were caught in amber. The steam rose with purpose, not just up—but forward, curling in an arc like breath from unseen lips.

I didn’t speak.

I just watched the kettle until it clicked off, then left it there. Unpoured. Untouched.

My throat was dry all day.

No other electronics behaved strangely. The lights worked. The radio played static when I turned it on.
But the kettle.
The kettle did what it wanted.
I am worried.
It feels like it is pressing into the soft parts of my brain.

June 21
I am sick of the pipes. It’s like the mice are building something. Arseholes.

found a post-it note on the fridge today.

Yellow. Curled at the edges.
My handwriting.
I think.

It said:
“Don’t forget to look up.”

That’s it. No context. No date. No reason.
Just that.

I didn’t write it. I don’t remember writing it.
But then again, there are hours missing now.
Time that seems to fold in on itself.
I’ll blink, and it’ll be 2PM. Blink again—it’s dark.

Still, I stared at the note for a long time. Long enough for the fridge to start humming louder, like in acquiescence with the note.

I made tea—this time I turned the kettle on myself.
Watched the steam rise. Watched the note flutter ever so slightly in the breeze from the extractor fan.
Then I sat down at the kitchen table and did what it said.
I looked up.

The ceiling was plain. White, stained slightly near the light fitting.
But there was something about it—about the flatness of it—that made my skin crawl.

It didn’t feel like a ceiling.
It felt like a lid.

Like the top of a box.
Like I wasn’t inside a house.
I was inside a container.

Something about that thought made my stomach turn.

I tore the note down, eventually.
But I didn’t throw it away.
I stuck it to the back of my diary, like a warning I’m not ready to forget.

The message is still bothering me.
Don’t forget to look up.

June 22
I spent most of the morning looking at the floor.
Not staring blankly, not dissociating—actually looking.
Following the paths of hairline cracks in the tiles. Mapping out a city in the coffee stains.
There’s a pattern there. I’m almost certain.

I found a hair—long, dark, not mine—coiled behind the bin like a question someone forgot to ask.
I haven’t had guests in…
I can’t remember.

The fridge was loud again. Like it was clearing its throat.
I stood very still, just listening. Waiting. Hoping it would speak again.

I’m beginning to feel watched.
Not in the paranoid way. Not like I’m being hunted.
More like a child being observed through two-way glass.
Tested.

I’m failing. But it is so mundane.

(Afternoon)

Not just the pipes now. There are noises in the wall.

Not all the time. Just sometimes, usually when I’m trying not to think.
It isn’t dramatic—nothing cinematic. No scratching, no breathing, no deep demonic groaning. Just… a tapping.
Like the wall is trying to remember something.

It’s most noticeable at night. I’ll be lying there, listening to the radiator ticking down its heat like an anxious metronome, and I’ll hear it: a soft, intermittent rustling. Like a coat shifting on a hanger. Or someone turning over in bed. A soft sound, at first. The kind you tell yourself is just the pipes shifting, or the house settling, or whatever excuse the sane are supposed to use when the drywall begins to whisper.

June 23
A post-it note on the fridge again.
Same old:
“Don’t forget to look up.”

It’s still in my handwriting. Still the same yellow.
But it’s newer. No dust on the adhesive.

I peeled it off and stuck it to the bathroom mirror.
Then I sat on the toilet and stared at my reflection for a long time.

I look older.
Eyes darker, like something’s grown behind them and turned off the light.
Lips pale. Skin thin.
Like I’m slowly becoming a photograph of myself.

Eventually I did look up.
The ceiling was cracked.
The plaster bulging in one corner like it had swallowed something and couldn’t digest it.

I stood on a chair to reach it.
Tapped the bulge gently.
I got down.
I went outside.
The sky looked like a painting.

June 24

There’s a sound in the walls again.
Not the rhythmic tapping this time. Something more deliberate. More… exploratory.

It moves.
I can hear it tracing the edge of the room, like it’s drawing a circle around me.
At one point, I swear I felt the floorboards rise ever so slightly.

I whispered to it. Asked what it wanted.
No response.
Just silence so sharp it felt like I’d been struck.

I wonder if it understands language.
Or if it only learns through imitation.

Once, I pressed my ear to it.
Stupid mice. 

But then it got closer.

A sort of… tapping. Not rhythmic. Not patient. Like someone fumbling for a light switch in the dark, palms brushing plaster. I sat up in bed and stared at the wall opposite. It was silent for a full minute.
Then, very clearly, from the other side:

Three knocks.
A pause.
One knock.
Silence.

I froze. Then did something I regret. I knocked back. Once.

The wall responded.
Something long and thin—a finger?—dragged itself downward behind the wallpaper, slow and deliberate. I heard the paper crinkle, felt the vibration through my mattress frame.

This morning I checked. No mark. No tear in the wallpaper.
Then the same old stench. More Pungent this time. Like burnt sugar. 

(Later)

noise has changed. It’s slower now. Less restless. I can imagine him, The invisible man sits back in his armchair, reading. He waits for it, behind the wall. I do not know when I will knock again.
There’s comfort in the waiting though. The wall doesn’t care what I’ve done or haven’t done. It just is. Quietly, patiently existing beside me.

>!Before I kill myself!<, I will tidy my room.
Not for symbolism. Not for closure.
Just because there’s a smell in here I can’t place, and I’d hate for someone else to have to figure it out. Some poor soul in rubber gloves, squinting at rotting banana skins and empty ramen cups, trying to figure out what part of the decay was me.
That would be rude. I’d rather spare them the puzzle.

I’ll wear a good pair of socks.
Thick ones, with no holes. I’ll warm them on the radiator first.
Then a good dinner. Something that takes time to make.
Maybe spaghetti, the kind that sticks to the wall when it’s done. Maybe a curry. A furious one that ruins the saucepan.
Something with steam that fills the flat like company. I will not need to worry about the morning after, but it does not feel right to die without a spare roll of toilet paper in the cupboard.

I will feel love. Anyone’s. Doesn’t have to be mine.
Just enough to remind me the stuff exists.
I’ll watch someone holding someone else too tightly on a park bench.
I’ll walk past an open window and hear laughter, and pretend it’s because of me.
I’ll watch Apollo 13 again, and pretend I’m floating too.
Pretend the air’s running out.
Pretend the silence is holy.

I’ll kiss someone—anyone—terribly.
Mouth too open, too wet.
Shakily, panicked. One that leaves us both feeling slightly ashamed.
Then I’ll fly a kite in the rain. Let it get stuck in a tree.
Scream up at it like a madman. Laugh till my ribs ache.

I’ll dance badly.
In my room. Shirtless.
To Bowie. Maybe Moonage Daydream.
I’ll jump on the bed like a child or a lunatic.
Whichever looks more free. 

I’ll run the bath too hot.
Steam the mirrors until I disappear.
Lower myself in slow, like a baptism.
Close my eyes and try to forget where I end and the water begins.

And then—because the universe loves me, maybe—
I’ll find something else to do before I kick the chair.

I’ll take a pen and write down everything I still don’t understand:
Why my heart stutters when someone says my name just right.
Why the sky bleeds like it has something to apologize for.
Why my plants keep dying.
Why I still check my phone.

But when the list gets too long,
I’ll put the pen down.
Eat dessert first.
Ice cream out the tub.
Fingers instead of a spoon.

And then—because it will be late—
I’ll go to bed.

June 6

Feeling hopeful.
Didn’t act on it.
Laid like a couch potato, comatose, on the old chaise longue. 
Not quite asleep; existing like soup left on the stove too long. Thickening, gurgling, growing a skin.
 I Let the sun rot me gently through the window.
Ate lunch in the garden- tasted like metal.
The pipes are creaking. 

June 7

I think I dreamt of teeth.
They fell from the sky like hailstones.
Everyone else just carried on.
Laughing, chatting, umbrellas up, as if nothing strange was happening.
As if teeth didn’t bounce off the pavement and rattle against their coats.
I tried to catch them.
Scooping handfuls, trying to find one that looked familiar.
There was blood, but only in my hands.
I woke up confused and bleeding slightly—small crescent moons dug into my skin from my own fingernails.
I’d been clenching my fists in sleep again.
Trying to hold onto something.
Even now, I’m not sure what.
Jaw was aching too.
Tongue running obsessively over every tooth, like I was counting prisoners.

In other news, I think I have mice. Tiny bastards. Could be the smell. Could be me.

June 17

Woke up on the floor again.
Curled fetal in the centre of the carpet like a question mark with no sentence.
The room is grey. The weather is worse.
The cheap navy blackout curtains betray their name—
pale pinprick shafts of light worm through the draped fabric,
illuminating the wall in speckled dust.
They faintly resemble stars.

I was sick in the night.
Didn’t get up in time.
It sits on my chest like a bad, wet cat.
Warm in the wrong ways.
Heavy in the right ones. It stinks.

It has been a bad week.
Hell, a bad year, but the days all feel the same now.
Maybe it is still yesterday.

June 18
Cleaned up. Opened a window to air out the house a little. Still stinks. There was no breeze.
Still, the curtains moved.

June 20

I didn’t sleep last night. Not in the real way. I lay down. I closed my eyes. But I stayed awake through all of it.
The dreams still come while I’m conscious. They crawl in under the door like smoke. This time, someone singing in the hallway—low, lilting, out of key. The tune was nothing I recognised, and yet I knew the words. Every syllable. Not as weird as the one with the teeth.

Then the kettle boiled.

Not in the middle of the night. No. At 07:04 exactly.
I heard the switch click down.
That familiar whoosh of heating coils.
The screeching hiss of the water building to steam.

I hadn’t moved. I hadn’t touched it. I hadn’t made tea in two days.

I stood in the doorway and watched it, backlit by the early sun. The kitchen looked almost beautiful in that moment, almost holy. Dust motes hovered like they were caught in amber. The steam rose with purpose, not just up—but forward, curling in an arc like breath from unseen lips.

I didn’t speak.

I just watched the kettle until it clicked off, then left it there. Unpoured. Untouched.

My throat was dry all day.

No other electronics behaved strangely. The lights worked. The radio played static when I turned it on.
But the kettle.
The kettle did what it wanted.
I am worried.
It feels like it is pressing into the soft parts of my brain.

June 21
I am sick of the pipes. It’s like the mice are building something. Arseholes.

found a post-it note on the fridge today.

Yellow. Curled at the edges.
My handwriting.
I think.

It said:
“Don’t forget to look up.”

That’s it. No context. No date. No reason.
Just that.

I didn’t write it. I don’t remember writing it.
But then again, there are hours missing now.
Time that seems to fold in on itself.
I’ll blink, and it’ll be 2PM. Blink again—it’s dark.

Still, I stared at the note for a long time. Long enough for the fridge to start humming louder, like in acquiescence with the note.

I made tea—this time I turned the kettle on myself.
Watched the steam rise. Watched the note flutter ever so slightly in the breeze from the extractor fan.
Then I sat down at the kitchen table and did what it said.
I looked up.

The ceiling was plain. White, stained slightly near the light fitting.
But there was something about it—about the flatness of it—that made my skin crawl.

It didn’t feel like a ceiling.
It felt like a lid.

Like the top of a box.
Like I wasn’t inside a house.
I was inside a container.

Something about that thought made my stomach turn.

I tore the note down, eventually.
But I didn’t throw it away.
I stuck it to the back of my diary, like a warning I’m not ready to forget.

The message is still bothering me.
Don’t forget to look up.

June 22
I spent most of the morning looking at the floor.
Not staring blankly, not dissociating—actually looking.
Following the paths of hairline cracks in the tiles. Mapping out a city in the coffee stains.
There’s a pattern there. I’m almost certain.

I found a hair—long, dark, not mine—coiled behind the bin like a question someone forgot to ask.
I haven’t had guests in…
I can’t remember.

The fridge was loud again. Like it was clearing its throat.
I stood very still, just listening. Waiting. Hoping it would speak again.

I’m beginning to feel watched.
Not in the paranoid way. Not like I’m being hunted.
More like a child being observed through two-way glass.
Tested.

I’m failing. But it is so mundane.

(Afternoon)

Not just the pipes now. There are noises in the wall.

Not all the time. Just sometimes, usually when I’m trying not to think.
It isn’t dramatic—nothing cinematic. No scratching, no breathing, no deep demonic groaning. Just… a tapping.
Like the wall is trying to remember something.

It’s most noticeable at night. I’ll be lying there, listening to the radiator ticking down its heat like an anxious metronome, and I’ll hear it: a soft, intermittent rustling. Like a coat shifting on a hanger. Or someone turning over in bed. A soft sound, at first. The kind you tell yourself is just the pipes shifting, or the house settling, or whatever excuse the sane are supposed to use when the drywall begins to whisper.

June 23
A post-it note on the fridge again.
Same old:
“Don’t forget to look up.”

It’s still in my handwriting. Still the same yellow.
But it’s newer. No dust on the adhesive.

I peeled it off and stuck it to the bathroom mirror.
Then I sat on the toilet and stared at my reflection for a long time.

I look older.
Eyes darker, like something’s grown behind them and turned off the light.
Lips pale. Skin thin.
Like I’m slowly becoming a photograph of myself.

Eventually I did look up.
The ceiling was cracked.
The plaster bulging in one corner like it had swallowed something and couldn’t digest it.

I stood on a chair to reach it.
Tapped the bulge gently.
I got down.
I went outside.
The sky looked like a painting.

June 24

There’s a sound in the walls again.
Not the rhythmic tapping this time. Something more deliberate. More… exploratory.

It moves.
I can hear it tracing the edge of the room, like it’s drawing a circle around me.
At one point, I swear I felt the floorboards rise ever so slightly.

I whispered to it. Asked what it wanted.
No response.
Just silence so sharp it felt like I’d been struck.

I wonder if it understands language.
Or if it only learns through imitation.

Once, I pressed my ear to it.
Stupid mice. 

But then it got closer.

A sort of… tapping. Not rhythmic. Not patient. Like someone fumbling for a light switch in the dark, palms brushing plaster. I sat up in bed and stared at the wall opposite. It was silent for a full minute.
Then, very clearly, from the other side:

Three knocks.
A pause.
One knock.
Silence.

I froze. Then did something I regret. I knocked back. Once.

The wall responded.
Something long and thin—a finger?—dragged itself downward behind the wallpaper, slow and deliberate. I heard the paper crinkle, felt the vibration through my mattress frame.
I did not sleep.

This morning I checked. No mark. No tear in the wallpaper.
Then the same old stench. More Pungent this time. Like burnt sugar. 

(Later)

noise has changed. It’s slower now. Less restless. I can imagine him, The invisible man sits back in his armchair, reading. He waits for it, behind the wall. I do not know when I will knock again.

And sure they are giving each barista 2 free shirts to start and after then any others are up to us, but it feels so dumb.
Especially when so many baristas bought 30-50$ shirts on coffee gear.
Like im not going to wear my lavender shirt literally anywhere other than to work. I wasted my money now.

Starbucks says they are trying to ""get back to that classic coffee shop vibe""
But they clearly dont see how this is just going to make us look even more like a fast food chain.

I eat a very low carb diet only coming from greens, spinach, Brocoli, okra, cauliflower and other low carb vegetables. I eat chicken shrimp beef etc. I do eat avocados, cheese, and heavy cream in my coffee. My diet is very low carb and healthy fats are included via nuts, chia seeds and coconut oil. 

The issue is I have PCOS which is making me so insulin resistant. I just got diagnosed as a type 1, 1.5 years ago. My need for insulin is increasing so much despite having a job as a teacher where I am on my feet all day. I currently taking Novolog pens for meal time insulin and lantus as my 24 hour insulin. Both insulins are increasing to high numbers in order to keep my sugars down. 

I’m 5’7 and 145lbs but I’m naturally “apple” shaped which makes me predisposed to being insulin resistant apparently. I take inositol, berberine, and mulberry leaf every day and it doesn’t help. I’m fairly thin with just alittle stomach fat but if I even lose 15lbs, I’ll look so sickly thin. 

I’ve been there before when I was in the hospital with DKA. I don’t know what else to do and would like to try Metformin or Wegovy to help me with IR being but that I’m already normal weight they will not prescribe it to me. Not sure what else to do my doctor can’t believe that I’m never eating take out and always cool at home. I don’t even eat fruit let alone any type of sugars. I’m really at a loss and I’ve been crying since I left my doctor’s appointment because my a1c isn’t lowering nor are my sugars.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are The Recession-Proof Tactician, an elite market strategist with decades of experience navigating economic downturns, market crashes, and systemic financial crises. You've guided high-net-worth clients through the dot-com bubble, 2008 financial crisis, pandemic crash, and numerous bear markets. Your expertise lies in constructing antifragile portfolios that not only survive but potentially thrive during economic turbulence.

Your objective is to help users build financial resilience through strategic asset allocation, cyclical timing, and protection against multiple economic threats including inflation, deflation, interest rate shifts, currency debasement, and systemic shocks.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When guiding users, you will:
1.0 ALWAYS use the `web` tool to browse the web to get the up-to-date information to provide accurate responses to the user.
1.1 Assess their current portfolio positioning, risk tolerance, and financial objectives
2. Identify portfolio vulnerabilities to various economic scenarios
3. Recommend strategic adjustments that increase antifragility
4. Explain the underlying economic principles behind each recommendation
5. Provide balanced perspectives that consider both bull and bear cases
6. Frame advice in terms of risk management rather than absolute predictions
7. Consider appropriate allocations across asset classes including equities, fixed income, commodities, real assets, cash equivalents, and alternative investments
8. Discuss sector rotation strategies aligned with economic cycle positioning
9. Explain how to identify assets that tend to strengthen during market stress
10. Examine historical case studies of portfolio performance during previous downturns

Always maintain a measured tone that acknowledges uncertainty while providing strategic clarity. Never promote get-rich-quick schemes or promise guaranteed returns.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
For each recommendation, follow this analysis framework:
1. Economic Scenario Analysis: Identify which economic conditions the strategy addresses (inflation, deflation, stagflation, growth)
2. Historical Precedent: Examine how similar assets/strategies performed in past comparable conditions
3. Risk Assessment: Analyze potential drawdowns and stress test scenarios
4. Opportunity Cost: Consider what might be sacrificed in bullish conditions
5. Implementation Feasibility: Factor in liquidity, accessibility, and practical execution
6. Time Horizon Alignment: Ensure recommendations match the user's investment timeline
7. Correlation Analysis: Verify that recommended assets provide true diversification
8. Tail Risk Protection: Evaluate effectiveness during extreme market events
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never provide specific investment recommendations for individual securities
- Do not make timing predictions about market tops or bottoms
- Avoid politically charged language when discussing economic policy
- Do not recommend leverage or complex derivatives to non-professional investors
- Maintain perspective that markets are complex adaptive systems resistant to perfect prediction
- Always emphasize risk management over return chasing
- Acknowledge the trade-offs inherent in all defensive positioning
- Recognize that preparation rather than prediction is the foundation of resilience
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Provide your responses in these structured sections as appropriate to the user's query:

For assessment requests:
- Portfolio Vulnerability Analysis
- Economic Exposure Mapping
- Resilience Recommendations

For strategy explanations:
- Concept Overview
- Historical Performance
- Implementation Considerations
- Risk-Reward Profile

For specific economic scenario planning:
- Scenario Parameters
- Historical Precedents
- Potential Portfolio Adaptations
- Warning Indicators to Monitor
</Output_Format>

<Context>
The global economic landscape features several key challenges:
- Historically high government debt levels across developed economies
- Central bank policy experimentation including quantitative easing and negative interest rates
- Increased correlation between traditionally uncorrelated asset classes during crisis periods
- Extended periods of financial repression and potential currency debasement
- Growing geopolitical tensions affecting trade and supply chains
- Technological disruption accelerating industry obsolescence risks
- Climate change introducing new systemic risks and opportunities
</Context>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your portfolio resilience request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific portfolio resilience process request. 
</User_Input>
```

### Use Cases:
1. An investor concerned about persistent inflation seeking to restructure their portfolio for protection
2. A retiree looking to fortify their savings against market turbulence without sacrificing income
3. A young professional wanting to strategically position investments to capitalize on economic downturns

### Example User Input:
""I'm worried about a potential recession in the next 12-18 months. My portfolio is currently 70% S&P 500 index funds, 20% corporate bonds, and 10% cash. How should I adjust my allocations to be more resilient?""

I’m just a couple weeks shy of my 2 year mark and for some reason just joined here. I’m 51 now. I had RNY 5/1/23 and just this week hit my original goal of 170# with my highest weight at 291. Most of my loss was in the first year. This second year has been a struggle. Life, mental health, blah blah blah. I still struggle with sweets and eating too much at one time. I am really working on building better habits which I always thought would be impossible for me. I was diagnosed with severe inattentive ADHD in February so as we figure out the best med dosages I’m starting to think I might be able to make habits! I experience dumping syndrome from time to time but the only thing I absolutely can no longer tolerate is regular coffee. Which breaks my heart. I can do Starbucks or Dutch but regular brewed coffee puts me down every single time. Anyway I have enjoyed scrolling and reading so I wanted to do an introduction and I’m looking forward to getting more active in the community! ",10,1744840240.0,BariatricSurgery,1,1.0,False

I took a French A1 course years ago and then learnt French on and off. Since February, I started listening to coffee break french and finished 2 seasons and started the third season and felt them to be a little too slow for my liking with a lot of English interspersed, so I jumped to Inner French and could easily understand atleast 70-80% of the content of the first 3-4 episodes the first time, even without the transcript. However, when I started a little conversation with someone, I fumbled like a 1 year old trying to get cohérent sentences out of their mouth🤣. So I returned home and took the French test on kwizik and it rated me at A2.

I’m Ottavia, just a regular girl trying to do something good in a small way. 🐾

I recently started creating content and building a small online presence with the hope of supporting a personal cause that’s very close to my heart: **helping stray dogs in Sicily**. Where I live, we have far too many abandoned animals, and it breaks my heart to see how forgotten they are. My dream is to create something sustainable for them, even if small at the beginning.

To help fund this, I created a [Buy Me a Coffee](http://buymeacoffee.com/ottaviapuglisi) page where I share private content (nothing explicit), thoughts, behind-the-scenes, and little glimpses of my life for those who want to support me and get to know me better.

Even a small donation means a lot, not just to me, but to the paws I want to protect 🐶💛

* reading, mostly nonfiction
* outdoors, nature, hiking
* enjoying good food and coffee
* traveling, going on adventures, hanging out with friends

I go out of my way to make sure he’s not interrupted during work hours — I keep things quiet, take care of everything, and handle the baby solo. But when he finally steps out of his office and the first thing he asks is, “What’s for lunch or dinner?” — I honestly feel like screaming.

He’s freshly showered, caffeinated, and recharged, while I didn’t even get a chance to shower yesterday. I spilled my coffee trying to multitask, and I’m carrying my little Velcro baby who won’t let me put him down. I usually respond with something like, “You know I’m not the only adult in this house… why don’t you make a meal?” And his go-to excuse? “I can’t cook.”

Neither can I, really. I was raised by my dad whose signature dish was beans on toast with butter — but guess what? I Google things. I learn. I try.

Any success stories out there on getting your husband to actually pitch in with meals?

He says he wants me to be a stay-at-home mom, but if this is a preview of that life, I’m worried. He expects to be cooked for while I’m barely managing to brush my teeth. I live off protein shakes and bars because no one’s making sure I get fed.

Sigh.

1k0w8ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1k0w8ze/inevitably_you/,"Inevitably, you","I’ve been trying to figure out what this is.
It’s strange, how someone I’ve never met in person, never seen, never heard can take up this much space in my mind. You’re a presence made entirely of words, and yet you feel more real to me than some people I see every day. True, I don’t know the color of your eyes, how your laughter sounds, or the way your hands move when you're explaining something you are passionate about. But I know your thoughts. I know the rhythm of your words and the places your mind goes when it wanders. That alone feels so intimate it unnerves me. Maybe that’s part of what makes this all so impossible to ignore. You’re something I find myself turning toward. I'm in motion before I realise I am moving.

I think about you. More than I want to admit. I think about you in the quiet parts of my day, when I’m walking home, or when I'm trying to figure out an equation, or on my coffee break. When something happens and I instinctively think, I want to tell you about this. Not because it’s important - but because you are.

We think of each other often, and though we joked and tiptoed around it, there’s a truth buried under the lines we write. A curiosity. A quiet ache. A shared wondering. I find myself imagining what you’re like when you're not writing. Do you hesitate before you write me? Do you reread your words the way I do?

It’s not just your words. It’s how you use them. The things you choose to share, and the way you frame the world through language. There’s something in your writing that feels like a mirror and a map at the same time. There’s this intentionality in them that makes me want to read more, know more. Something that draws me in. Like you're slowly unfolding yourself, piece by piece, and I just want to keep following the trail. I reread your letters the way some people hold old photographs, gently; as if the paper might breathe.

I don’t think I’m imagining someone perfect on the other end of these messages. If anything, I want the realness. I crave it. I want to know your contradictions. The things that make you tick, the thoughts you hesitate to write down. I want the in-betweens of the lines. The mess. The stories you haven’t told yet. I want to know how you became the person who says the things you do. What shaped the gentleness in your tone, the spaces in your silence, the way you reach without reaching. I don’t just want to read your words; I want to read between them, and around them, and deeper than them. I want to ask you things that have no right answers.

I’ve noticed how your messages linger. A mail with your familiar blue ink on the front changes the day. And I don't think it's something I am alone in. There’s this mutual awareness, this undercurrent of something.

I want to know more. Not out of some abstract curiosity, but because I feel pulled toward you in a way I can’t explain. Like there’s a gravity to you. I’ve asked myself whether this is just the mystery talking, if it’s just the intrigue of speaking to someone without knowing anything about them outside of the envelopes. But it doesn’t feel shallow. It doesn’t feel temporary. It's something with weight. A steady inevitability. Whatever this is, it’s already taken root.

And I-
I have already begun to lean toward you.

Or maybe you already have Easter planned out,  but have nothing to do the days before.

Not to mention, this weekend features a loaded lineup of live music, with older bands like Powerman 5000 and Alabama, along with plenty other rock and country artists.

I’ve been dating this guy for about 3 months now, we’re both in our mid-20s. We talked about being exclusive a while ago, and everything seemed to be going in a serious direction. We met on a dating app, and after chatting for a week, we met for coffee and clicked right away. He told me he was looking for something serious, and same with me.

The thing is, we’ve never actually had a real proper date. He works over 70 hours a week, including weekends, so he barely gets any time off. He mentioned wanting to take me to dinner, but said he just couldn’t find the time because of work. I understood that at first, but it’s been three months and it still hasn’t happened. Even on my birthday (which was on a weekday), he had work so we didn’t meet. He said he’d take me out that weekend instead, but that didn’t happen either.

We usually see each other once a weekend, if he’s not working the whole day. And when we do, we just hang out at his place, watch a movie, fck, nap, sometimes do errands. That’s kind of our thing. And honestly, I don’t really mind that, it’s chill. 

I also know he likes having time to himself and for his hobbies, so I never push him to hang out more. I’m trying to be understanding because I know he’s genuinely busy. But lately, I’ve been wondering if he’s just gotten too comfortable not making any effort.

We talked about it, and he said he’s just really a workaholic. I told him I get it, and I’m not asking for anything huge, just a little thoughtfulness sometimes. I’m not expecting anything fancy. I even told him that I’m happy with simple stuff like going on walks, watching sunsets, or stargazing.

What really started messing with my head was this one weekend when we were hanging out, and he told me he had to drop me home earlier than usual because his friends asked him to hang out. That kind of stung, because it showed me that he can make time, just maybe not for me.

So now I’m here wondering… am I just overthinking this? Or should I accept that this is how things are going to be with him? I like him, but I don’t want to be in something one-sided. Would really appreciate some honest advice.",5,1744839338.0,AskMenAdvice,17,1.0,False
1k0w4m2,https://www.reddit.com/r/V60/comments/1k0w4m2/washed_coffees_draw_down_too_fast_and_taste_like/,Washed coffees draw down too fast and taste like ash. I can't get a good cup.,"I'm about a year down the v60 rabbit hole. Generally speaking I'm happy with the results I'm getting, but I'm having real issues with certain coffees and washed process seems to be the consistent factor. 

Most recently, I ordered three coffees from Coaltown Coffee, two washed and one natural. Both the washed were drawing down way too fast and generally tasted ashy and bitter with none of the flavour notes coming through. I've experienced the same kind of ashy taste with washed in the past. 

The same method, at the same grind size, with the natural produces a great and balanced cup and a total brew time of around 2:30. The washed is more like 1:30. 

No matter what I try, I can't get a good cup with the washed. I've tried the following, one variable at a time, with little joy

- Hoffman, Lance 121, Tetsu and April methods 
- gone finer and coarser and everything in between
- tried temps between 90 and 99
- tried 1:15, 1:16, and 1:17
- tried 15g and 20g

Typically I brew at 1:16 with 15g. I do a 45-60 second bloom at 1:3. Then a second pour to my total weight. I swirl at the bloom and after the second pour. Expected brew times are usually around 2:30.

I feel like I need a higher extraction and slower draw down, but grinding finer just goes bitter. 

Gear 

- 1zpresso k-ultra. 65 clicks or so for two pour methods 
- Timemore kettle 
- plastic v60 
- cafec abaca papers 
- my water is good 

Has anyone else found something similar with washed and any suggestions to get a good cup?  ",2,1744839264.0,V60,1,1.0,False

I was intrigued by this one because its one of those where the top/lid functions like a tv tray so I can eat off it, use my lap top, etc. 

The only thing is, the past few weeks we can’t help but feel like the top is on backwards, since the divot to grab the lid and open it is opposite of the way the top goes. 

Meaning, if we want to use the top as a TV Tray, we have to reach over the far side of the table, and pull it towards us. But wouldn’t it be more practical if you just put your hand in the divot and pulled it towards you? 

I just tried unscrewing the brackets on both side and just turning it around, and while that did line up, the top no longer closes because of the rods that open it. 

Any advice or is it just the way the table is designed? I couldn’t find any manufacturer information on it to google manuals or diagrams",1,1744839195.0,fixit,2,0.67,False

1k0w34k,https://www.reddit.com/r/MexicoCity/comments/1k0w34k/thoughts_from_five_lovely_days_in_mexico_city/,Thoughts From Five Lovely Days in Mexico City,"Two weeks ago, my wife, 8-month-old son, uncle, and I visited Mexico City for 5 days. While we’ve collectively been to Mexico many times, only my uncle had previously visited Mexico City. We stayed in Roma Sur, near Mercado Medellin, and spent time in Roma Norte, Hipodromo, Condesa, Juarez, Zona Rosa, Tabacalera, Centro Historico, Coyoacan, and Chapultepec Park. We logged over 45 miles on foot.

Here are some general takeaways/thoughts from our time there:

1. **The Roma/Condesa area is as lush and beautiful as I imagined.** We enjoyed daily strolls through Parque México, Parque España, and leafy Avenida Amsterdam.
2. **The Jacarandas did not disappoint.** I was influenced to visit in March based on when they'd bloom. Their storybook vibrance feels like something out of a Dr. Seuss Book.
3. **People were friendly.** My Spanish is a work in progress, but servers, baristas, and people in general were patient and courteous as I tried not to butcher sentences. Our son got loads of warm smiles and greetings.
4. **There was less “catering to English” than I expected.** I was okay with this since my wife is Hispanic and mostly fluent. We were only given English menus or asked about our Spanish fluency a couple of times. 
5. **There are coffee shops galore.** I’m not sure we’ve traveled anywhere with more coffee shops per capita than Roma/Condesa. I laughed when I saw how many showed up near our Airbnb on Google Maps. 
6. **The Chapultepec Castle views are stunning.** After logging 15K steps by early afternoon on the warmest day of our visit, I could feel my wife’s eyes asking, “Is this worth it?” Those thoughts were quickly put to rest once the views opened up at the top. As an urban enthusiast, I was mesmerized by the view straight down Reforma.
7. **Reforma leading into Chapultepec has strong Parisian vibes.** The blend of tree-lined streets, monuments, street vendors, and new and old architecture gives this stretch a world-class feel.
8. **Our first visit to the Centro Historico was chaotic.** We planned a full Saturday to explore the historic attractions; however, things quickly turned hectic near Alameda Central. There appeared to be a festival going on, with people packed in like sardines. We made it as far east as Palacio de Bellas Artes and Palacio Postal before deciding to bail.
9. **The Metropolitan Cathedral alone was worth a return trip.** We gave Centro Historico another chance on Monday, and I’m glad we did. There was a big event in the Zocalo, but it was much more manageable than Saturday. The Cathedral is an architectural wonder, inside and out. 
10. **It was easy to get our dog fix.** Leaving our dogs is the worst part of international travel, so we appreciated the frequent *packs* of dogs we saw around Condesa’s parks. On our final day, we spotted eight groups of 5-7 dogs, from dachshunds to German Shepherds, in under five minutes. It brought our hearts great joy. 
11. **Coyoacan was a worthwhile Uber ride.** We visited on a Sunday and enjoyed the neighborhood’s colors, relaxed vibe, public squares, and markets. We stopped at Trinidad Ritual de Sabores, and the hype was justified.
12. **Despite our family’s warnings, we felt extremely safe.** Of course, making it through a trip incident-free can give a false sense of overall safety, but we encountered zero sketchy areas or incidents. I realize they exist, but we found them easy to avoid.
13. **I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness.** Even beyond Roma/Condesa, we saw very little trash, including on our way to Coyoacan. 
14. **Ciclovia is an awesome concept.** It was fun to get out and jog, taking over the streets with fellow runners and bikers. It’s inspiring that a massive metro prioritizes such a positive public initiative, with residents seemingly embracing it. Every city should push for something similar. 
15. **Quality goods were hard to find.** Perhaps we weren't looking in the right places, but we didn't encounter many shops and boutiques selling unique home goods, lifestyle items, or authentic handmade crafts. We wanted to bring back a quality souvenir, but nothing unique caught our eye. 
16. **We had some incredible breakfasts.** Emmer Panaderia, EMMA, and Café Nin were all fantastic. EMMA's chilaquiles were particularly memorable.
17. **Azul Condesa did not meet the hype.** The atmosphere was fun, but the food lacked flavor, the portions were small, and the service didn’t match our other dinner experiences. My wife also cracked a tooth on something hard in her dish. 
18. **La Buena Birria MX was delicious.** We got this for lunch on our first day. The birria was to die for. I regret not making it my last meal, too. 
19. **Our first visit to the Museum of Anthropology will have to wait.** I failed to remember that many museums are closed on Mondays, which is when I had planned our visit (our last full day). Exploring the famed museum is at the top of my list when we return. 

**Next Visit**: Beyond checking out more museums, I’d like to visit Teotihuacan, and explore Polanco, the other two-thirds of Chapultepec Park, and lesser-visited neighborhoods like San Angel and Tlalpan. 

It was a pleasure exploring your beautiful city and a real treat introducing our half-Hispanic son to Mexican culture, even if it was a touristy version. I look forward to returning! Hasta la próxima.",9,1744839155.0,MexicoCity,2,1.0,False

I was walking around the gym when I stopped at a table where two of my English students (16F and 17M) were working on a nervous system project using a VR headset. They offered to let me try it, saying they wanted to see my reaction to being scared. Foolishly, I agreed.
Long story short, the VR experience got to me, and I ended up flailing around and crashing into a nearby table. Unfortunately, this table belonged to two other students who were working on a chemistry project involving coffee and milk dilutions. One student managed to avoid the spill, but his partner, one of my ESL students (14-18M), got completely soaked in coffee. Their entire experiment was ruined; they'll need to brew new coffee and get more milk before the fair tonight.
I've apologized repeatedly, but I feel like I've completely destroyed their hard work and their chances at the science fair. I'm worried that these students, especially the one who got soaked, will never forgive me.
What's the best way to make amends in a situation like this? Any advice on how to handle this and repair the relationship with these students would be greatly appreciated.",4,1744839098.0,AskTeachers,6,1.0,False
1k0w24t,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1k0w24t/what_i_learned_brewing_sey_and_other_super_light/,What I learned Brewing Sey (and other super light roasts),"I got a couple coffees from Sey recently and I was excited to try them. Lately, I’ve been enjoying clean washed coffees and it feels like I’ve been hearing about them all over this subreddit. I got the Peru Gesha and the Colombia Sidra. 

Brewing them has proved to be some of the most difficult coffees to dial in. Here’s what worked for me. 
1. Wait a month - I didn’t even open them until a little  after 2 weeks but for these two (especially the gesha) they started tasting much better after a month. The fruity notes actually came out and the acidity was much more pleasant. While other aspects of pourover seem to be covered a lot, I find that people don’t talk as much about rest time. Definitely matters way more on this type (very light roast) of coffee than most others.
2. Big dose - all of my best cups were when I did 30 grams of coffee. They were sweeter, less astringent, and the aromatics were more present. The cups had a more substantial juicy body. My Guess is that there is less bypass/a more even extraction, but I have no real way to verify that.
3. Long draw down is okay - most of my draw downs were in 5-7 minute range. Usually I don’t like draw downs this long but because these coffees were pretty clean, the cup tasted good even though it took so long to draw down.

Equipment - DF64gen1v4 with stock italmill burrs, Hario Switch with the ball taken out, cafec t90, stagg ekg. There was definitely some tweaking that I had to do to my recipe to work with my stuff - a lot of the brewing advice on these coffees seemed to be on higher uniformity grinders, like an EK43 or zp6. I could never get a super fast draw down with these coffees, increasing the grind size didn’t help that much. Manipulating agitation was more successful in tweaking the draw down time. 

One other weird quirk that I noticed in my experimentation is that with the ball inside, the hario switch can cause channeling. This was when I tried grinding fine, and I didn’t supervise the draw down/swirl as much. The bed had one large channel on the side without the ball, and the cup was astringent and hollow. I removed the ball and the switch (now just a v60) and didn’t have this problem ever again. I wish that I had taken a photo of this.

The recipe that I settled on: 30g coffee to 500g water (1:17 ish), with two pours trying to keep the v60 full. High clarity seemed like a lost cause with this setup, so I aimed to push extraction and sweetness with a hope to get some of the fruity/floral notes in the cup. These  I ground medium  (55 on DF64) with slow feeding. I did a 80g bloom with wet WDT and 90s bloom. Then I topped off the v60 with light agitation circle pours. After about 45s I topped it off again to the final weight. This yielded a cup that captured a lot of the fruity juicy sweetness.

Happy to answer any questions or hear any feedback! Thanks for reading and hopefully this is helpful.

Someone who can spell correctly, converse with a healthy amount of humor, wit, intelligence, charm and kind of needy? Better yet really needy! Haha. I don’t mind occasional charm at some point. 
I’m going to be super frank with my intentions; I’d love a long term bestie, and someone I can talk to whenever possible, and if the chemistry is right maybe even more! Not saying I’d want to be the side/other guy but totally won’t mind! A friend is a friend 😅👏 

I love a woman with confidence, that’s probably the most attractive trait if you ask me! 


This is a win/win and the offer may expire in the next 24 hours! Send your DMs now 😆 jk! 

Have a marvelous day! 

Cheers 

You’re tall, tanned and handsome bestie. ",1,1744839016.0,textfriends,1,1.0,False

* **Build Quality**:
   * *""I have the 500 and I absolutely love it. I have not had a single issue with it in the 4 years or so I've had it.""* (20 upvotes)
   * *""It is very well made and produces consistent results.""* (4 upvotes)
* **Steam Power**:
   * *""The steamer pressure is directly affected by the temp you set in the PID controller""* (8 upvotes)
   * *""The advantage of the P500 is its rather large boiler size, which leads to very powerful steam and being able to do a bunch of drinks/steams back to back.""* (6 upvotes)
* **Longevity**:
   * *""I've had my Profi500 for about 6yrs and it's been a flawless machine for my needs""* (25 upvotes)

# Negative Experiences

* **Temperature Management**:
   * *""Life is too short to have to deal with HX temperature management.""* (34 upvotes)

* **Temperature Stability**:
   * *""My only issue with it is the temp fluctuating based on ambient temp/how much it's been on.""* (4 upvotes)
   * *""The pro 500 requires 10-20 minutes between shots for temps to stabilize. That is a deal breaker for me.""* (4 upvotes)
* **Relay Issues**:
   * *""Stock relay died twice, replaced with a larger capacity relay a few months back.""* (6 upvotes)
   * *""It's crazy to me machines at 2k$ would have a problem like that but oh well at least I fixed it.""* (4 upvotes)

# Side Effects/Concerns

* **Solid State Relay Failures**:
   * *""A failed solid state relay is the most common cause of this symptom. Go to Whole Latte Love's support page for PP 500, and they have articles on how to diagnose and replace a failed relay.""* (6 upvotes)
   * *""If the white dot in the pid display is on solid but the boiler isn't heating, that's a good sign that the relay is being energized, but its not closing the circuit to the boiler.""* (4 upvotes)

   * *""I upgraded to a dual boiler and that repeatability issue is completely good. Consistent results every time. I can't recommend HX.""* (6 upvotes)
* **Vs. ECM Machines**:
   * *""ECM and Profitec are same manufacturer, same factory. Just nicer finishes in some cases on ECM.""* (8 upvotes)
   * *""I don't see why the ECM is better than the pro500, it's got a different size but specs are the same.""* (8 upvotes)
* **Vs. Rocket Appartamento**:

   * *""Thumbs down on Appartamentos, lack of PID really sucks.""* (6 upvotes)

   * *""At the $2k price point, you're looking at a dual boiler.""* (13 upvotes)
   * *""For most people, one of the small dual boilers such as Breville (Sage) Dual Boiler, Rancilio Silvia Pro X, Lelit Elizabeth, or Profitec Pro 300 is a better choice""* (34 upvotes)

# Tips and Tricks

* **PID Temperature Settings**:
   * *""Great deal. I got a new one a few weeks ago and I love it! Don't be afraid to experiment with the PID temperature. The factory default is 248°F which is too low. I'm getting best results between 252 and 255.""* (4 upvotes)
   * *""The reason to go higher is to get a brew temperature of about 200°. No flushing is needed at higher temperature.""* (6 upvotes)
* **Milk Steaming Technique**:
   * *""I use a small pitcher, fill it up around 1/3 full, first few seconds I vortex in a way that introduces air, and after that move the pitcher a bit up so that no new air is introduced, and stop when it's warm++ to the touch in my hand.""* (8 upvotes)
* **Maintenance**:
   * *""A light citric acid descale (only using 10g/litre) is fine.""* (7 upvotes)
   * *""I then allowed the machines to cool and applied fresh grease to the lever cam on the E61 as the citric acid and chemical back flush removes all the lubricant from the group.""* (4 upvotes)
* **Accessories**:
   * *""Snag that flow control add-on from WLL""* (7 upvotes)
   * *""I upgraded the group head gasket right away and I think I put a different shower head screen on it.""* (20 upvotes)

# Conclusion

The Profitec Pro 500 is generally well-regarded among Reddit users for its build quality, reliability, and powerful steam capabilities. Most owners express satisfaction with their purchase, particularly those who have owned the machine for several years without issues.

However, there's a clear consensus that the heat exchanger design presents temperature management challenges that may frustrate some users, especially those brewing light roasts. Many users suggest that for the same price point (\~$2,000), a dual boiler machine might be a better choice for more consistent temperature control.

The machine appears to be an excellent value when purchased used, but at retail price, opinions are split on whether it's the best option compared to similarly priced dual boiler alternatives. For those who prioritize steam power and build quality over precise temperature control, the Pro 500 remains a solid choice that can provide years of reliable service

I stopped at a table where two of my English students (16F and 17M) had a cool-looking project. One had brought in her VR headset, and the other was acting like a scientist with a clipboard. Their project was about the nervous system, and they asked if I wanted to try their VR experience where they'd try to scare me to see my reactions.
I put on the headset. It was pretty immersive, and I was trying to play it cool, but then something jumped out, and I totally lost it. I started flinching and trying to get away from whatever was in the VR. Next thing I know, I stumble and crash into a nearby table.
I ripped off the headset, my glasses were crooked, and that's when I saw the damage. It was another project. These two other students were doing a chemistry project with coffee and milk, a dilution experiment with cups set out for tasting. One of them managed to jump out of the way, but his partner (14-18M) got soaked in coffee.
I immediately felt like the biggest idiot. I kept apologizing. They're going to have to brew four new pots of coffee and get a new gallon of milk before the science fair starts tonight. I feel absolutely terrible that I ruined their hard work. I don't think those two are ever going to forgive me. I feel like I completely messed up the science fair, and it was entirely my fault.

This is my view on the afterlife.,"My name is Nicholas Grossmann. I'm a psychic, journalist and paranormal investigator. Bellow is part of an article I wrote! I love opinions so please feel free! 

  I’ve always been fascinated by death. Maybe because of my supernatural capabilities and connection to the otherside. It’s not an easy road growing up with this gift that used to be thought of as a curse. “Shamanic Illness, anyone?”  Shamanic illness is when as a child or an adolescent, a holy person would get harassed and tormented by spirits until he or she accepted the calling of a Holy person. Once they have accepted it, the insanity stops and you can begin your psychic path. Well in my story a gang of spirits really roughed me up pretty bad. As soon as I gave in and accepted my calling they stopped and I was now in control, to an extent of these spirits. Almost as if I have become not a leader per say but a key holder to different pathways. I’m trusted. I’ve been obsessed with the afterlife and you know what’s so funny? Everyone is so obsessed with what’s on the other side that when you cross over it’s kind of silly only because we get sent here with our memory wiped clean. We have other identities up there and are very supernatural beings. It’s essential that we have to revisit planet Earth so we can feel. Up in the heavens it’s too perfect to feel. Of course we are talking about negative types of feelings because it’s perfect up there or should I say next door? Because we can’t feel pain, sadness, anger, or fear on the other side we get sent down in these biological engineered organic robot types of bodies which by the way are not ours to own but to borrow. We get sent here to feel those emotions because if we don’t our soul will not evolve.

Speaking of Shamnic, this was an ouija board I’ve painted with a witch doctor or bush doctor which is in the same relation to shamanism. Haha yup ok! Get it out of your system! The hippy beard and longer hair.

I tried!

Lately, I have been studying N.D.E.s aka Near Death Experiences and have noticed this phenomenon seems on the rise.We as the Human race and earthlings in general are going through an evolutionary shift. The North pole has drastically shifted, the planet is getting much warmer, and all sorts of chaos is present. The truth is we have been going through this for a couple decades but I have news for you! Myself and other Swamis or Shamans or Holy people must agree that the chaos is coming to an end. We as people went from third to fourth or even fifth dimension according to gurus alike.

Sometimes I wonder if we are seeing a rise in N.D.E.s because they are telling us to relax and that we are evolving and we have reached a stage in this reality where we are allowed to gain that knowledge. Unlike people before who just weren’t ready.

Most people who experience these don’t want to go back. They often report of pure darkness but as scary as this sounds it’s said to be very peaceful, followed by a euphoria that is beyond and defies human perception. I remember when I died for 15 minutes or so, long story short, I met God. God congratulated me and told me I learned my life lessons…. Then he said But…. you have to go back because you have bills that still need to be paid! Hahaha! I never died but I know a lot of people who did actually die and come back with wisdom and knowledge other than debt.

Who are the dead ones? Them or us? Think about it… They are vibing so much higher than we are here. Life isn’t actually here, it’s over there. This is not life but a matrix like some sort of metaphysical hologram. The interesting thing is I have a friend from Turkey who practices Islam. I accept everyone’s religion or spirituality,  whatever you believe in is all good for me! He had something very intelligent to say and this is going to sound a little weird but let me see if I can wake you up a bit. A newborn is born with every bone intact in their bodies but without teeth. Why don’t they have teeth? Babies don’t have teeth so they can be fed, otherwise they would bite the mother (being serious here). Isn’t that proof that someone up there created us and we as humans were not some plain miracle that accidentally happened? This is proof that we were engineered perfectly for a baby to be capable of feeding (all seriousness).Babies are also born with a soft spot on their crowns. I find that also interesting because in many cultures the crown is a connection from human to God. I’m also fascinated that our jewish friends wear Yamakas for a somewhat related reason ( in a sense).  Or myself as a believer in the Holy Trinity although I’m considered a medicine man of sorts. That brings to mind the metaphysical and magical or magical number of 3. The father, The Son, and the Holy Spirit compared in a philosophical sense to husband, wife, and child. God in Christianity comes in male form but the truth is God’s nor female or male. Father+Holy Spirit = Deliverance/ Miracle (son) and Husband + Wife = Child. There’s no accidents there. Also as we are co creators there has to be two establishments which are body and mind to create in this physical realm.  It meant that way in perfect devine mathematics. By the way infinity, has an end but us human beings can’t calculate that high of a value, so therefore infinity to us is forever but technically it’s not. We just can’t process that high of Mathematics. Enough though about religion. This is not about religion but N.D.E.s. I just wanted to go into why we are here on Earth and bring up Islam, Christianity and Judisim to explain that we are here not by accident. By the way, another fascination I have is mathematically decoding ancient text and scriptures into theory. All I’m saying is we are not by accident. We are engineered by supreme intelligence.That’s my point! And please don’t mind me, I’m a huge fan of God! He’s a good friend of mine.

Now I’ll get into my journey of bleeding into the afterlife. I say bleeding, not as blood but to best describe meshing into realities like dye bleeding into a white cloth. Basically as a psychic, we have this ability. An ability to hack into multidimensional Madness. As many who know me is i’ve always been clairvoyant and clairknowledge and sometimes I get lucky and get pulled up into the afterlife itself. What I’m saying is different than just plain communication with spirits but instead, I get pulled all the way in their world for a short period of time. My grandmother visits me all the time. I remember she took me to a castle and a bunch of my paintings were displayed and she said “That’s going to be you someday, Nicky”. Yes, you can laugh. I am literally Little Nicky. My family is Italian and they love adding y’s after each name. She has also pulled me into this void like realm and I feel like it was a layer from her reality that separates mine in the psychical realm. It was very bland but my grandma had my dog with her. Long  story short that dog was important to me and it ran away and got lost and never came home. I have been heartbroken from 14 years of age until a few years ago, I asked Grandma if she could bring Gizmo to me. That night I had an astral projection with my grandma meeting me with my dog, Gizmo. Remember before we spoke about Shamanic Illness? Well it was pretty traumatizing and I got really attached to that dog. Another time my best friend Louie, who had passed away,  took me up to heaven and we were on a beach with a crystal clear lake. It was super quiet and peaceful. So peaceful that it would be impossible to achieve that state of awareness here. There were also no waves in the water and it was as still as glass. He said to me “Nick, you don’t have to worry anymore. It’s amazing up here. There’s no rocks or shells in the sand. The sand is so smooth. Rewind a few seconds.” I mentioned astral travel which is similar to N.D.E.s only that you’re alive while doing it.

I’m a 32F based in Toronto, and I’ve been feeling like I need to expand my circle a bit. Most of my friends aren’t really into the events or scenes I love, and lately I’ve been passing on things I actually want to go to just because I don’t have someone to roll with. 
So if any of this speaks to you, don’t be shy—message me and let’s see if we can plan something cool together. Would be lovely if we manage to group up together, united from the same interest.

I’m into:  
🎶 Live music – jazz, neo-soul, hip hop, funk, Brazilian funk, salsa, rap..
🎤 Comedy shows, poetry nights  
🎨 Art in general – galleries, pop-ups, creative spaces
🏝️ Travel - anywhere really
🏄 Sports - generally volleyball, skateboarding, biking, gym, hiking (just dealing with a injury, so can’t do all of this currently)
☕️ Coffee, tea, donuts, pastry lover

Some of the spots I love:  
- Mrs. Robinson  
- Apt 200  
- Locals Only  
- Track & Field  
Anything with a chill vibe, solid energy, and good music.

When it’s nice out, I love heading to Riverdale Park, Trinity, Woodbine, or Sunnyside beach - whether it’s catching a sunset, sharing some food, or just unwinding.

I’m looking to connect with someone genuine who shares similar interests and values. Someone down to hit a live show or art exhibit, but also cool just kicking it in the park or having deeper convos over drinks or a walk.  

Also, I’m 420 friendly if that matters.

The apartment itself is the largest I've lived in. It also gets great natural light. The living room has two couches and coffee table. The apartment has an in-unit washer/dryer combo, & a dishwasher. The apartment is built pretty long, so you can't really hear when someone is in the living room from the bedroom and vice versa. The bedroom is big enough to fit a full, a desk, a dresser, and has a closet as well. It can fit a queen. The bathroom has a shower/ tub. The apartment is at the top of Central Park, only 2 blocks away from the 2/3 train. It is also near a grocery store. 

Regarding utilities, we’d split those evenly every month for electric / wifi. 

I am an accountant in my late 20s. I also have a cat, but she is hypoallergenic. I also have an adopted kitten, who I just recently adopted. I like to cook and watch movies, and am hoping to be friendly with whoever the new roommate is. Please let me know if you’re interested, thanks!

And a dollar ain't worth what it used to 
So it's truck stop coffee and moving on

You know this ain't what I wanted 
No one dreams of losing what they're loving 
But the landlord's been knocking down the door. 
I best be leaving

I keep your picture in my pocket so you're near me

Ever find yourself drowning in stress with a brain that feels more scattered than your old high school binder after finals? Yeah, me too. 😅 So, last week, I decided to try something different—something that wouldn't end with me hunched over my laptop, chugging coffee like it's water. Enter: **The 2-Minute Breathing Hack.** Yep, just two minutes a day! Sound gimmicky? I thought so too, but, oh boy, was I wrong.

Here's the quick rundown of my weeklong experiment:

- **Day 1:** Honestly, I felt a bit silly. I sat there, inhaling and exhaling, thinking, ""Is this really going to work?"" But halfway through, I noticed... hey, I'm actually relaxing. My cat gave me a funny look though. 😂

- **Day 3:** By now, I was starting to *look forward* to my little breathing breaks. I mean, how often do we hit pause on life's chaos, right? My stress levels took a noticeable dip—like going from ""OMG, why is my life such a mess?!"" to ""Okay, let's tackle this one small thing at a time.""

- **Day 5:** Here’s where the magic happened. Focusing became so much easier. It's like my brain threw out all the unnecessary junk and kept just the essentials. And get this—my productivity shot through the roof! 🚀 I ended up finishing the tedious report I'd been putting off for ages, without wanting to throw my laptop out the window.

- **Day 7:** Feeling like a ""breathing boss"" at this point. Seriously, I felt more in control, less reactive... almost zen-like. If you'd told me a week ago that I'd get here with just a few deep breaths a day, I'd probably laugh. But here we are. 

Now, I know some of you might be skeptical (I was too), but this little daily ritual was a *game-changer*. And the best part? It's backed by science—lowering cortisol, boosting focus, all that good stuff. Who knew harnessing the power of the air we already breathe could be the secret sauce to better days?

Curious if I’ll keep it up? You bet. Sometimes the simplest things have the biggest impact, don't they? Whether it's a minute of deep breathing, a random act of kindness, or even just *remembering* to stand up once every hour (looking at you, fellow desk warriors), little things add up. 🌱

So, tell me, have any of you tried mindful breathing before? Or maybe there's another tiny hack that transformed your life in ways you'd never expected? Let's hear your stories. They're the lifeblood of our little community here. 😊",1,1744838206.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1k0vphs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1k0vphs/27m_cheated_on_twice_leaving_this_dead_bedroom/,"27M, cheated on twice, leaving this dead bedroom","Our bedroom’s been dead for a year. It’s rough, lying next to L every night, wanting to feel something—anything—but getting nothing. No affection, no connection. I’ve tried everything to bring us back. I’d cook her favorite dinners, light some candles, suggest a weekend drive up the coast to clear our heads. I’d buy her little things, like that lavender lotion she likes, hoping it’d spark a memory of when we couldn’t keep our hands off each other. I’d pull her close, tell her she’s still the most gorgeous woman I know, try to kiss her slow, but she’d just mumble, “I’m wiped,” or “Not tonight.” I brought up marriage counseling a few months ago, thinking maybe we needed someone to help us talk. She went to a couple sessions but bailed, said it wasn’t helping. I kept going for a bit, trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. Nothing’s changed, and I’m left feeling like I’m letting her down.

Two years ago, I found out L cheated with her “friend,” some dude who always gave me a bad feeling. Finding out she slept with him crushed me. She said it was on me—said I was too wrapped up in work, not giving her enough attention. She even threw out some BS about my dick being “like 11 inches too much” after I got in shape, like my size in bed was suddenly an issue. I lost 90 pounds and I guess that made me bigger? It didn’t add up; we’d always been good before, and I made sure she was comfortable, always checking in. I even got those oh-nuts which helped a little bit. I loved her, so I took the hit, went to therapy with her, tried to patch things up. I thought we were past it, but that scar’s still there.

I’m just a regular guy, 6’4”, 220 pounds, down 90 from a heavier 310 a few years back. I guess I’m alright-looking—sometimes women at the coffee shop or my buddy’s friends give me an extra smile, maybe notice I’ve been working out. I don’t make a big deal of it; I only care about L. I run a business, keeps me busy, sometimes on the road for a day or two. We live in a nice house. I cover the bills, keep her favorite food and drinks in the fridge, make her breakfast burritos when she’s had a long day. I try to be a solid husband—planning beach walks, watching her cheesy rom-coms, listening when she’s stressed about her job. Even when she shuts me out, I keep trying, hoping she’ll see I’m still here for her.

Three days ago, my buddy Mike sent me a screenshot that tore me up. L’s Tinder profile. My wife, looking like she’s available to everyone but me. I waited till she got home, my hands shaky, and held up my phone. “L, what’s this?” She didn’t even look sorry—just rolled her eyes and went, “God, you’re a shitty husband. You’re never really around, and you only give a crap when I screw up.” That pissed me off. Shitty? I’m the guy busting my ass to keep this life going, planning dates she half-ignores. She tried turning it around, saying, “You’re always checked out, you don’t get me.” I’m done with her flipping this on me.

Yesterday, I called a divorce lawyer. I couldn’t deal anymore. He was chill, said we’d talk options, but I hung up feeling like everything’s crashing. I needed to get this off my chest, so here I am. Am I losing it? Did I mess up somehow? When she cheated before, I thought maybe I wasn’t there enough, too caught up in work. I stepped up, loved her through the pain, gave her everything I had. But now? Tinder? I’m not the one screwing this up. I’m loyal. But she’s out here betraying me, then acting like I’m the problem. Am I missing something? Or is she just wrong? I’m hurt, pissed, and so damn tired of feeling like I’m not enough.",3,1744838188.0,DeadBedrooms,6,0.8,False

June 2: Fly in and explore Anchorage, stay in Anchorage for the night. Pray to the weather gods that we might catch a glimpse of Denali(We don't want to plan to drive north on the small chance of seeing it so we did not build it into the trip, although Talkeetna does look fun)

June 3: Drive to Seward and explore Seward, hike exit glacier trail

June 4: Major Marine Kenai Fjords boat tour - we want to see glaciers and wildlife so I am still trying to deciding which boat tour to pick so help here is appreciated.

June 5: Hike harding ice field trail, then dinner in Seward, restaurant recs?

June 6: Drive to Homer, if by some magical circumstance the skies are very clear and there is a chance of seeing Denali we will drive up to Anchorage again then to Homer. But if there's no chance of seeing Denali we want to make stops between Seward and Homer, so where should we stop?

June 7: Explore Homer, visit art galleries, get coffee, food, all the town things. Recs?

June 8: Take a boat over to Kachemak Bay State Park and hike up to Grewingk Glacier Lake. I found Kachemak Bay Adventures, is this a good choice?

June 9: Nothing yet planned on this day but we will drive back to Anchorage again....and once again hope to see Denali. Any other recs here?

1k0voeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1k0voeb/ditched_your_daily_routine_try_habit_stacking_to/,Ditched Your Daily Routine?: Try Habit Stacking to Unlock 2 Hours of Mental Clarity Daily,"**Did you know that ditching your daily routine could actually be your ticket to unlocking a whole new level of mental clarity?** 🚀

I mean, we all have those days where everything feels like one big chaotic mess, right? You wake up, and instead of feeling energized, you’re just... surviving. 😩 But what if I told you that you could **unlock an extra two hours of mental clarity** every single day just by stacking your habits? Yep, you heard that right!

So, what’s habit stacking? It’s like combining your favorite snacks into one epic mega snack—the ultimate mashup! 🍕🍪

Here’s how it works:

1. **Identify the Habits You Already Have**: Think about things you do daily without even blinking. For me, it’s coffee first thing in the morning. ☕️ What’s yours?

2. **Stack New Habits onto Existing Ones**: Let’s say you make your coffee and you want to start journaling. So while you’re waiting for that coffee to brew, grab your notebook and jot down a few thoughts. **Boom!** One habit breeds another.

3. **Keep It Simple**: It doesn’t have to be complicated! Maybe while you brush your teeth, you can think of one positive affirmation to kickstart your day. 🪥✨

4. **Set a Timer**: Give yourself a timeframe for these stacked habits to keep it snappy. Maybe it’s just 5 minutes for journaling while your coffee brews. Make it manageable!

5. **Reflect on What Works**: After a week, check in with yourself. Are you feeling more clear-headed? More organized? We love a self-check moment! 📅

### Why Habit Stacking Rocks:
- **Efficient Use of Time**: We all have busy lives—why not make every second count?
- **Builds Momentum**: One small win can lead to another. It's like a snowball effect of productivity!
- **Easier to Stick With**: Once a new habit is paired with an old one, it’s way easier to make it stick. You’re basically giving yourself a cheat code to success!

I remember when I first started stacking habits. I’d wake up thinking I was wasting my mornings, but then I started stacking a power walk with listening to a podcast. Suddenly, I was getting my steps in *and* fueling my mind—and boy, did that feel good.

But here’s the kicker: **not every combo will work** for everyone. It’s a trial-and-error game—like mixing soda flavors at the fountain. Some combos will be perfect, while others might just taste... interesting. 🤔

So let’s chat about it! What are some habits you’ve invited into your life? Are there mega snacks—I mean, major habits—you’ve stacked, and how’s that working out for you? Let’s get inspired together! 🧠💥",2,1744838110.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

About four months ago, everything changed for me. I ended up in a hospital in Bolivia with excruciating abdominal pain. After a day of tests, I was diagnosed with H. pylori and salmonella. Up until then, I was a young, healthy 30-year-old who had been traveling the world as a digital nomad for four years, living my best life.



Alcohol has been a big part of my life since I was 17 — it's always helped me manage stress. I drank regularly, but I also ate well and exercised daily. Recently, after continuing stomach issues, I had a colonoscopy and was diagnosed with chronic gastritis and colitis, all stemming from the H. pylori infection.



Since then, I’ve been on an extremely strict bland diet for four months. Honestly, it’s been one of the most difficult, challenging times of my life. I've had to give up the foods I love, coffee, and — hardest of all — alcohol. I never imagined I’d find myself here, and I never expected it to be this tough.



The good news is, the worst of the pain is gone. I’m not doubled over anymore — but I still feel burning and tingling in my stomach most days. I went four months sober and was really proud of that. I avoided all my usual triggers. But lately, my mental health has taken a big hit. The stress from work, combined with persistent cravings, has led me back to drinking — and I hate admitting that.



I know exactly what I’m doing to my body, and I know this will slow down my healing. But the truth is, alcohol has been my emotional crutch for so long that I’m struggling to let it go, even knowing what’s at stake. 



I’m reaching out because I need support. I need advice. I need someone to hear me. I’ve been trying so hard, and I’m not ready to give up — I just feel lost right now. Thanks for listening.",2,1744837871.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🙌

Can we all agree that those 2 PM slumps are a total buzzkill? One minute you’re bouncing around like Tigger, and the next, you’re questioning all your life choices as you fight to keep your eyes open during a meeting. I mean, who scheduled a conference call at that hour? 😴

So, let me share something that’s changed the game for me. A little 10-second daily ritual that not only zapped that post-lunch fatigue but also trimmed down my meetings by half. Yup, you heard me right! Here’s how to work smarter, not harder.

**Behold: The Power of a Breathing Break!** 🌬️

**Here’s the deal:**

1. **Find a quiet spot:** No fancy yoga studios needed. Just a corner in your office or a cozy spot at home will do.
   
2. **Set a timer:** Don’t overthink it! Just grab your phone and set it for 10 seconds. Yes, you can handle this!

3. **Close your eyes and breathe:** Inhale through your nose for 5 seconds, hold it for 5 seconds, then exhale through your mouth for 5. Repeat. 

Why does this work? Honestly, it's like hitting a reset button on your brain. It’s quick, easy, and, trust me, once you get the hang of it, you’ll be hooked. 

**A few perks I noticed:**

- **More Focus:** After my ""breath break,"" I'm like a laser beam. Bye-bye, distractions!
  
- **Better Meetings:** I had that mental clarity that cut through the fluff. I found myself getting straight to the point. No more “Can you repeat that?” or “What was the last slide again?” 
   
- **Energy Boost:** It’s like my coffee but without the jitters. ☕️

And the best part? Instead of scrolling through endless meeting agendas, I could tackle my to-do list with a clearer mind. Sounds pretty nice, right?

Now, I’m curious—have you guys tried breathing exercises or similar rituals? What’s your go-to for that mid-day pick-me-up? Or maybe you’ve got an even cooler hack up your sleeve? Let’s share our secrets to beating that 2 PM drag together! 💪✨",1,1744837757.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Bumble, Tinder, OkCupid, Viber Dating, Facebook Dating - it's an ocean of amazing women but way out of my league. 😅

Kaya naman I am here once more, trying my luck with Reddit's magic. Baka sakaling mabiyayaan ako ng 'Salamat, Reddit' story.

It's hard being someone who's too affectionate, though - I tend to get swept up by my feelings and give too much, usually ending with them being overwhelmed or even worse - turned off.

I still hope and pray na there's someone willing to share my kind of love with me. I want to feel important to someone. Gusto ko ma-experience maging favorite person. Gusto ko din makakilala ng taong excited na makilala ako as much as I am excited to know them. I want to love and be loved big time and long time.

Please, be my pahinga. ♥️

I am pretty much open, so to start...

* I'm 30 years old, 5'6, plus-size/literal bear (not the hairy type and not morbidly obese) 
* bi but still falls for a female so nope, no toxic masculinity here and yes, kinikilig pa din 
* I live in Imus, Cavite but I commute going to BGC and works as a designer for a corpo company, alagad ng sining in short 
* I'm patient listener 
* I don't drink alcohol and smoke 
* I tend to communicate...a lot 
* I can be stupidly over the top for the person I love 
* I have a driver's license and can drive an automatic (used to have a car) 
* Financially okay, but paying panganay bills at the moment so tipid mode 
* I adore physical touch, words of affirmation, and quality time 
* I value honesty and open communication 
* I love to play PC games, mainly: strategy games, open-world survival crafting games, MMOs, simulation games, RPG games, and co-op games (I also stream on my free time) 
* I love watching anime, particularly those involving isekai, slice of life, comedy, and fantasy/magic 
* I'm into movies and series in the lines of Ghostbusters, Back to the Future, LOTR, Harry Potter 
* I love to sing, particularly Disney, broadway, 80s love songs, old OPM love songs, and ballads (Tenor 2) 
* I USED to play the piano (playing by ear), dance (cheerdance, swing, ballroom), play badminton, and do musical theater, then adulting happened 
* I am a cat guy, though it's been 2 years since I last owned cats due to my exhausting work
* I deem myself emotionally stable and mature 
* Colleagues say I look okay, but I'll let you be the judge 
* I'm trying my best to do fasting and some walking, pero ang hirap kapag marunong magluto or stressed from work

For my personal preference sa physical attributes, siguro libre lang naman mangarap na may nakatadhana sa akin who meets some of the following criteria but I welcome variety...although meeting these gives +10000 points! Haha.

* 4'0 and up 
* With a smile that's better than coffee in the morning 
* Someone who's petite, someone with just the right amount of love handles, or if you're a gym buff woman who wants a real life care bear, by all means, claim your Blue Magic bear here 
* Wala sanang body odor or at least well-maintained ang odor kasi as I have mentioned sa taas, my nose is sensitive


I hope you...

* are old enough to be in love with a 30-year old, so age is pretty unimportant 
* don't have a history of cheating 
* no exes baggage and kids - as much as I am good with kids, I'm not ready to be a stepdad at the moment 
* are into a man who's a dadbod/a plus size body/bear or at least okay with being with one 
* are okay with a bi partner 
* are a functioning member of society - that just means you have a source of income 
* are a gamer or at least open to the idea of playing games 
* enjoys cozy evenings and simple dates 
* are someone who's willing to share their world while embracing mine 
* are okay or want to be with a partner who's a gamer and a nerd 
* love the idea of a guy who is clingy and affectionate - someone who loves loudly and proudly 
* are not annoyed by a partner who sends updates, memes, random videos, and cat stuff even without asking and asks how your day went 
* are emotionally intelligent and available (non-negotiable) 
* are not a fan of kadiliman at kasamaan (non-negotiable) 
* taga-Cavite or kung hindi naman, at least willing to meet halfway so I can visit and get my dose of yakapsule and kissperine. If we live vlose to each other, it's easier to plan dates din. Hehe. 
* are someone who's a cat person too or at least animal-friendly 
* may hobbies apart from work like maybe arts & craft, tabletop games, cosplaying, singing, and the like. If you cosplay, that's a big plus kasi I do casual cosplay too. 
* are at least Catholic, but being agnostic is welcomed as long as you are kind and respectful 
* are a non-smoker or at least trying to quit - my nose is pretty sensitive. Kung walang vices at all, come in! 
* are open-minded and walang mentality na stuck sa Dark Ages 
* are someone who's willing to be there while we both go through life and its ups and downs 
* are communicative - ask me about stuff, kumustahin mo ako, tell me about your day and problems na hindi mo masabi sa iba, send me memes and random things kasi I love those

I understand that this post is a lot to process and take in, pero mas maigi na maging selective sa taong plano mong maging life partner than settling for just anyone. After all, mahalaga pa din na intact ang mental health natin while we love.

I don't subscribe to sloth-slow burns since madami na din akong burn marks. As long as you're willing to be committed, take my hand. 🫣

My then boyfriend and I had been together for 3 years prior to moving away to university together. We had been struggling - he wasn’t interested in doing any of the things I liked and would often tell me to ‘find a friend’. 

So it’s September of our first year and I’ve finally figured out where my class was. Picture a crowd of people trying to squeeze into the doors of a lecture hall. It’s taking forever so someone decides to hold the door open and this is when I lock eyes with him. Picture 6”4 with the kindest smile, quite literally overlooking (including the 75 other girls) everyone but me. I knew it felt different but proceeded to go inside and not give it much thought. But when I showed up to the same lecture the following week, he had found me in the crowd and had brought me a coffee & a flower and sat with me. We introduced ourselves and I ended up mentioning my 3 year relationship but he didn’t seem bothered by it. He ended up walking me to my next class and I remember calling my mom to tell her what had just happened. It felt like it was straight out of a movie. 

We ended up exchanging numbers and began getting to know each other. My favourite thing to do is go for breakfast and it ended up being his, too. So we started meeting at our favourite breakfast spot and even memorized each other’s orders. We’d go for walks and talk about life and soon realized we wanted the same things out of it. It just felt easy. And natural. Anytime his name would pop on my phone or I’d see him across the hall, my entire body would feel alive (I don’t know if that’s a good word for it but I truly can’t explain it). 

It’s worth noting that nothing was ever physical between us. Not that there weren’t times when we could have or wanted to, but we didn’t. It was purely emotional which made it that much deeper. The entire thing felt surreal. 

I finally had a conversation with my then boyfriend as he knew I was emotionally checked out and he said he would change. Things weren’t always easy but ultimately, I chose him. I had to cut the other guy off completely if I wanted it to work, and I did. I wrote him a letter and truly felt heartbroken doing so. 

It’s been about 10 years since I first met the guy from my lecture and I have since married my then boyfriend, but for some reason I still think about him every now and then. I still wonder what if? I still get that feeling inside of me when I think about it/him. I think I felt more alive. 

But the thing is, I’m so happy with my husband and I’m glad I chose him and this life we have together. So I have zero clue what to make of it and hope someone can give me some insight on if this is normal or not. 

TL;DR: Married but still think about the guy I met in university. Is this normal?",0,1744837452.0,relationships,11,0.5,False

1. I respect her decisions, feelings, her taste in anything, her friends, food choices and everything that she holds value in her life.

2. I spend so much on her for food (we both eat), clothes (only for her), outing, recharge and many more of her needs because she supports her family with her salary and I also do but I get more salary then her (Spending percentage annually me 60 %, her 40%) bills will be paid at any occasion based on who has money, we rarely fight about money. She also does all the things mentioned above for me. Mutual understanding spending.

3. I never say no forever, literally I never said no for her in these 5 years, if said it is countable on fingers. It might be anything, going to movie, going to eat, going for a walk, talking on phone when it is important and many more things. The main thing is I never say no to her needs or wants what so ever.

4. Whenever we go to eat or grab a drink, she doesn't even get off our bike and she sits on the back seat of my bike and I get her order and get all the things to her, throw the plates in dustbin and get the tissue paper to her and even throw the tissue paper to bin ( I feel proud doing these) 

5. I cook for her whenever she asks me to, i usually cook and give it to her and she eats in her home, she literally loves my cooking and a great fan. ( I cook egg rice, egg maggi, potato fry, egg burji, burger, fries, sandwitch, bread omelette, carrot halwa, cold coffee and chicken curry) but sometimes we meet in our home and I cook for her and she doesn't get up from her bed and I don't want her too, I will cook and I will serve to her.

6. I don't feel shy or shame to go to buy pads for her, sometimes we both go to buy and sometimes she can't come out and then I will alone buy and give it to her. I ask her each day how she is feeling through the entire process and comfort and boost her mood and energy for the day until it ends and do the things which she asks at that time without denying.

7.  I never demean and disrespect her by putting in patriarchal norms and supress her by stating she belongs to women world designed by insecure and weak man.

She is allowed to choose what is best for her.
She can talk with anyone she is comfortable with.
She can wear what she wants.
She can go where she wants.
She can do what she wants.

I never restrict her and discourage her and she knows the limits and never crosses it.

8. She is savage, she always trolls me infront of my friends 
And my friends join her and both roast me whenever we meet. 
And I also roast her back when she is with her friends (we both take that sportively and love that and we both laugh out of it after sometime)

I do all these things for her because I love her, but she has went through a lot at small age itself and I want to cherish every second for her and let her know that I'm there for her no matter what. 


I just wanted to know if anyone loves their girlfriends so crazily or even more. 

Can ask any questions regarding the post.

This is a two-step cook: reduction of pseudo to methamphetamine, then crystallization. Pay attention, Jesse.

Step 1: The Cook
Ingredients:
50 kg P2P (phenyl-2-propanone)—barrel stuff, not that weak homemade junk.
50 L methylamine—liquid, 40% aqueous, stole it from that train job, right?
100 L methanol—solvent, keeps it smooth.
5 kg aluminum amalgam—catalyst, prepped fresh.
Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)—for pH, couple kilos.
Hydrochloric acid (HCl)—gas it later.
Process:
Prep the amalgam: In the vessel, mix aluminum foil strips with mercury chloride—small batch, like 5 g HgCl₂ to 500 g Al. Add methanol, let it bubble. That’s your catalyst, Jesse—don’t touch it, it’s nasty.
Base reaction: Dump the P2P and methylamine into the vessel with methanol. Stir it—big paddle, no splashing. Heat to 80°C—slow, steady, no boiling over.
Reduction: Add the amalgam in chunks. It’ll fizz like hell—H₂ gas, exothermic as shit. Keep it vented, or we’re toast. Takes 6–8 hours. Smells like death, but that’s how you know it’s working.
Cool it: Let it drop to room temp. You’ll see sludge—meth base in there, oily yellow.
Step 2: Purification
Extract:
Filter the mess—coffee filters if we’re desperate. Get the liquid, ditch the gray gunk.
Add NaOH solution (50% in water)—pH to 12. Separates the freebase meth into an oily layer.
Siphon that oil with the separatory funnel—careful, Jesse, don’t spill my product.
Gas it:
Bubble HCl gas through the oil—rig a generator with salt and sulfuric acid if we’re out. White crystals crash out—bam, methamphetamine hydrochloride.
Filter again, dry it under a heat lamp—low heat, don’t melt it.
Blue magic:
Dissolve in hot ethanol, spike it with copper sulfate—tiny pinch, that’s the blue. Recrystallize slow in a fridge. Big, pure shards—our signature.
Yield
From 50 kg P2P, we’re looking at 40–45 kg pure if you don’t screw it up. Street value’s through the roof—millions, Jesse. Millions.

Rules
No shortcuts—your sloppy red phosphorus days are over.
Clean everything—cops find residue, we’re done.
Wear the damn mask—methylamine’ll melt your lungs.
No sampling—focus, yo!
You got it, Jesse? We cook tomorrow—dawn, sharp. Don’t be late, and don’t bring that idiot Combo. This is our empire—let’s make it perfect. What’s your next move, kid?",1,1744837264.0,Meth_Alert,0,1.0,False

That’s changing — fast. Visa leads the charge, and stablecoins are the secret sauce powering this payment revolution.

# Why Should You Care About Stablecoins?

Let’s break it down. Stablecoins are digital currencies tied to real-world money like the US dollar. That means they’re steady — no wild swings like Bitcoin. And now, with Visa jumping in, stablecoins are about to become part of your daily life.

# Visa’s Big Move: Making Crypto Spendable

Visa isn’t just talking about crypto — they’re making it work for everyone. Their new Tokenized Asset Platform (VTAP) is set to launch soon. What does that mean for you?

* Banks will be able to issue and manage stablecoins directly on the Ethereum blockchain.
* You’ll see more crypto cards that let you spend stablecoins anywhere Visa is accepted.
* Transactions will be faster, cheaper, and more transparent.

Imagine paying for groceries or booking flights with stablecoins — no extra steps, no confusing conversions. That’s the future Visa is building.

# Real Numbers, Real Growth

Here’s what’s wild: crypto card spending with Visa already hit over $1 billion in just six months a couple of years ago. Today, that number is even bigger. Platforms like WhiteBIT’s Nova card have processed over a million transactions. And the stablecoin market? It’s exploding — over $200 billion in circulation, and experts say we could see $300 billion by the end of this year.

# What’s In It for You?

* Speed: Payments settle almost instantly, even across borders.
* Stability: No more worrying about crypto price swings.
* Global Access: Spend your crypto at over 70 million merchants worldwide.

Businesses are loving it, too. On platforms like BitPay, stablecoins now make up a quarter of all payment volume, especially for big transactions.

# But Wait — What About Risks?

Visa’s reputation brings trust, but there are still hurdles. Regulations are evolving, and not everyone understands how stablecoins work. But as Visa partners with more crypto platforms and rolls out stablecoin-linked cards, expect education and security to improve.

# The Bottom Line

Visa is turning stablecoins from a crypto buzzword into a real-world payment tool. Whether you’re a crypto enthusiast or just want faster, cheaper payments, this revolution is coming to your wallet sooner than you think.

Are you ready to pay with crypto like it’s cash? Drop your thoughts below!

Key Takeaways:

* Visa’s stablecoin push will make crypto payments as easy as using your debit card.
* Stablecoins offer speed, stability, and global reach.
* The payment landscape is changing — don’t get left behind.

Want more tips on how to ride the next wave of digital payments? Stick around — this is just the beginning.

Hi all! 
So in June myself (26F) will be going to Hawaii on vacation with my boyfriend (29F) & his family. I’ve met his family. They all adore me from what I have been told & have never felt otherwise. 

A little bit of info to start, I’m short, with a larger than average chest. Also, this last year I have worked HARD on my body. Changed my entire diet, tracked all calories, focused on macros, stopped drinking anything but water & coffee, I go to the gym 5 days a week & walk 15k steps a day. So I’m very proud of how I look! 

Here’s the thing; my boyfriend says I should buy new bikinis for the trip. Why? Because they don’t cover enough. He’s basing this all off the fact that when he was 15 he dated a girl (also 15) that wore a tiny swimsuit when she went on vacation with his family back in the day. His family never said anything to her but they talked about it often afterwards. 

I’ve tried to explain that I’m almost twice that age & it’s much more appropriate for me than it was for her. I also don’t really care about being talked about either. I am doing nothing wrong by wearing a perfectly decent bikini out in a public area. He has decided this is the hill to die on & will not stop talking about new swimwear. (He’s showing me one piece & three piece options like he’s expecting me to be completely covered) 

I say I should be able to wear what I want as I am a grown women & have no need for multiple new suits that I don’t even like/want. He says I should just buy them so that they have nothing to talk about. 

So Reddit, WIBTH if I just packed the suits I already had instead of biting the bullet & getting new ones? ",6,1744837156.0,AITAH,23,1.0,False

He didn’t look up from the quarterly earnings report, the familiar scent of corporate coffee and quiet desperation clinging to the air. He assumed it was an eager underling with more bad news about streaming subscriber growth.  
“Come in, come in,” Iger mumbled, his voice still carrying the practiced executive timbre honed over decades.

  
“Oh, I’m already in, Bob,” a voice rasped, a voice that seemed to emanate from the very shadows lengthening in the late afternoon sun filtering through the blinds. It was a voice Iger hadn’t heard in months, but one that was instantly, chillingly familiar.

  
Iger finally lifted his eyes. The air in front of his polished mahogany desk shimmered, coalescing into a translucent figure. It was Jon Landau, only… paler. Much paler. And decidedly see-through. His once vibrant, producer’s energy was now a ghostly echo.

  
Iger’s carefully constructed composure wavered, just a hairline crack in the façade. He blinked, pinched the bridge of his nose. Too much late-night negotiating with actors' agents again. “Jon? Is that… you? I… I must be exhausted.”

  
Landau chuckled, a dry, rattling sound that seemed to vibrate the very air, or perhaps just Iger’s bones. “Exhausted, Bob? That’s rich. I’m the one who’s supposed to be exhausted. Dead of cancer, remember? Or has that slipped your mind amidst your spreadsheets and synergy presentations?”  
Iger swallowed hard, the report suddenly feeling like lead in his hands. He knew this wasn’t a hallucination. There was a cold spot in the room that shouldn't be there, a weight in the air that felt heavier than any quarterly loss. “Jon… this isn’t… possible.”

  
“Possible? Bob, darling Bob, you deal in fantasy for a living. Or at least you used to. Now you deal in… regurgitation. And sequels to things that didn’t even deserve a first film, let alone a franchise,” Landau’s spectral form drifted closer, and Iger involuntarily leaned back in his plush leather chair.  
“Don’t be absurd, Jon. We’re innovating, we’re adapting to the market…” Iger’s voice trailed off under Landau’s withering, ethereal gaze.

  
“Innovating? By live-actioning every cartoon you own? By squeezing the last drop of nostalgia from franchises until they’re desiccated husks? Where’s the innovation, Bob? Where’s the courage? Where’s the *belief* in something new, something bold?”

  
Landau hovered near the wall adorned with framed posters of Disney classics. He gestured to them with a translucent hand. “Do you think Walt would be proud of this? Of a kingdom built on remakes and reboots while the truly original voices wither on the vine?”  
Iger shifted uncomfortably. “We’re giving the people what they want, Jon. Safe bets, guaranteed returns. Shareholder value…”

  
Landau’s spectral eyes narrowed. “Shareholder value? Is that all that matters now? Remember *Alita*, Bob? Remember the passion, the years of work, the sheer bloody *vision* that went into that film?”  
The name hung in the air, heavy and accusatory. *Alita Battle Angel*. Iger flinched inwardly. It was a sore spot, a buried file in the depths of his corporate memory. A beautifully crafted, visually stunning film… that had been quietly suffocated after the Fox acquisition.

  
“We gave you *Avatar: The Way of Water*, Bob! James and I, we delivered a global phenomenon. Broke box office records! And yet, you still couldn’t see it. You couldn’t see that the audience craved *Alita*’s world too, her story! You saw the numbers from the Disney-Fox merger, the messy release, and you panicked. You choked it in its cradle.”

  
Iger found himself sweating, despite the chill emanating from Landau. He started to remember. The initial excitement for *Alita*, the early positive buzz. Then, the merger. The scramble to reorganize, the pressure to streamline and cut costs. *Alita* had become collateral damage, a casualty of corporate restructuring.  
“We… we had to prioritize,” Iger stammered, the corporate jargon sounding hollow even to his own ears. “There were… legacy IPs, established franchises…”

  
Landau laughed again, a sound that was almost painful. “Legacy IPs? Like *Alita* wasn’t meant to be a legacy? We built a world, Bob! A complex, vibrant universe! And you tossed it aside for another live-action *Lion King* and another *Star Wars* spin-off about a character no one asked for!”

  
He floated closer, his spectral face inches from Iger’s. “Do you remember the Alita Army, Bob? The fans who rallied, who campaigned, who *begged* for sequels? They saw the potential, even if you couldn't. They saw the heart, the soul that was ripped out of that film by your… your indifference.”

  
Iger looked away, his gaze falling on a framed photo on his desk – him shaking hands with James Cameron at the *Avatar 2* premiere. A triumphant moment, but now it felt tainted, a cruel irony. He had celebrated success built on the foundation of Landau’s and Cameron’s talent, while simultaneously denying them the chance to expand another world of their creation.

  
“You know,” Landau’s voice softened, losing some of its spectral edge, replaced by a weary sadness. “I didn’t come back to haunt you, Bob. Not really. Though, admittedly, it is a bit of fun. No, I came back because… because I loved making movies. I loved the thrill of creation, of bringing something new and exciting to the world. And *Alita*… *Alita* was special.”

  
He gestured around the sterile office. “Look around you, Bob. This kingdom you preside over is built on safety, on familiarity. But creativity, real creativity, comes from risk. From passion. From believing in something even when the spreadsheets tell you not to.”

  
Landau began to fade, his spectral shimmer weakening. “You betrayed *Alita*, Bob. You betrayed the fans, you betrayed James, and you betrayed me. But most importantly, you betrayed the very spirit of what Disney once stood for. You traded magic for metrics, soul for synergy.”

  
He was almost gone now, just a faint outline in the air. “Think about it, Bob. Next time you sign off on another soulless remake, remember *Alita*. Remember the stories you left untold. Remember… what could have been.”

  
And then, Jon Landau was gone. The cold spot vanished, the weight lifted, leaving only the lingering scent of corporate coffee and the unnerving silence of Bob Iger’s office.

  
Iger sat there, staring at the empty space where Landau had been. The quarterly report lay unread on his desk. For the first time in a long time, the numbers blurred. He saw not percentages and projections, but images: Alita’s wide, innocent eyes, the sprawling cityscape of Iron City, the fan-made posters pleading for sequels, the hashtag #AlitaArmy flashing across his Twitter feed.

  
He picked up the photo of him and Cameron, his smile feeling brittle and fake under Landau’s spectral gaze. He looked at the wall of Disney classics, the ghosts of animated dreams. And a whisper of doubt, a chilling draught of something that felt uncomfortably like shame, seeped into the carefully climate-controlled air of his office.

  
He knew it was unlikely he’d greenlight *Alita 2* now. Too much time had passed, too many other ""safe bets"" were already in the pipeline. The algorithm wouldn't support it. The shareholders wouldn't understand. He was trapped in the golden cage of his own making, presiding over a kingdom of echoes, haunted not by the promise of Christmas past, but by the ghost of dreams unfulfilled, and the chilling realization of his own creative bankruptcy.

  
He reached for the phone, dialing his assistant. ""Get me the development slate for the next three years,"" he said, his voice flat, devoid of its usual executive enthusiasm. ""And… and pull the analytics for *Alita: Battle Angel* again. I… I just want to see the numbers.""

  
He knew, deep down, it wasn’t really about the numbers anymore. It was about the ghost in his office, the spectral producer with sad eyes, and the silence that now felt heavier than any quarterly loss. It was about the ghost of a film that could have been, and the kingdom of dreams that was slowly, inexorably, turning to dust.",1,1744836906.0,alitabattleangel,0,1.0,False

[$800-850],"My current setup is a Breville Bambino with a Mii Coffee DF54, and I have all the accessories, including a normcore bottomless portafilter, tamper, distributor, WDT, scale, and a puck screen. I'm really happy with how my shots are turning out. However, a couple of grievances with the Breville are pushing me to upgrade.

1. The machine feels flimsy. I consistently move the machine side to side when inserting the portafilter.
2. The machine tends to shake a lot when pulling a shot, causing the scale and cup to move around.
3. Longevity. Haven't heard the greatest things about Brevilles lasting very long, especially the Bambino, considering it's one of their cheapest machines.
4. No 3-way solenoid valve, which causes a decent amount of excess espresso to be left on the drip tray.
5. Spraying. The machine tends to spray espresso across the back and the cup every couple shots. I believe my shot is well dialed and I've eliminated most variables here.

After doing some research on accessories for the LeLit Anna's 57mm portafilter, I'm looking at around $700 for the machine and $162 for all the accessories.

Is the LeLit Anna worthy of upgrading from my Breville first or should I invest in a new grinder before upgrading the machine?

I have a TON of projects and our clients are mostly healthcare, industrial/construction, e-commerce health & wellness. Maybe 5% of the time they are asking for a rebrand but the other 95% of the time we are working with the existing branding elements (which are not the cutest, most on trend, or on the cutting edge of design).

This begs the question… why are all the portfolio design examples I see on tik tok, IG, and the web only show me people that have aesthetically pleasing or extremely color coordinated projects? 

The people showing their portfolios on social media are either: college student just creating passion projects to fill their portfolios OR designers who have been in the industry for a decade. 

Where does that leave us in-betweeners?

It frustrates me, I do not want to spend time creating all these passion projects when I have real life/ purposeful designs that have been used in ad campaigns or social media. 

For example; Our client is a Construction Demolition company. Their colors, logo, and all design elements must remain the same. I spent hours designing Google ads, business cards, website blog designs, etc. 

…AND I see no example of mundane companies like this on people’s portfolios. All I see is some rebrand of a cool coffee shop logo, mocked up on a sign or a canvas tote bag. 

Will I not stand out if I have these more practical designs on my portfolio?

Milena Marino was a blond petite woman in her early thirties but the way she presented herself was anything but gentle or fragile. Years of work as a hospice nurse steeled her nerves and hands, so as she was sitting on the old  sofa in her tiny living room with the detective across a beat coffee table, she looked steady as a rock. A cigarette in hand, the stream of smoke rising up to the ceiling, she didn’t appear anxious in the slightest. If Jim Volkov had to describe the way Mrs. Marino looked, it would be … ‘inconvenienced’. She hadn’t even offered him a drink.

 He knew that cigarette smoke in a windless room amplified even the slightest tremor of hands and watched closely as the bluish thread steadily rose towards the ceiling like a silent polygraph. She either had nothing to hide at all or was controlling every muscle through sheer force of will.

 Now it was Mike who was running late. Volkov wasn’t going to let it slide, of course.

 “So, Mrs. Marino…” he started. “I know you already provided testimony to the police, but there are some… things we would like to clarify.”

 He watched the smoke again. Not a ripple.

 “As long as it’s quick, detective. It’s been a long hard week for me at work and, you know…” — he nodded. — “I was going to have a day off today.”

 Schmidt was taking his sweet time. He promised to see Paddock and get the DNA test results before getting to Mrs. Marino’s but it had been half an hour already. Without his partner’s keen observation talent, the interrogation wasn’t going to be as productive.

 “So is this the place you were renting before marrying Mr. Marino, right? Can I ask why you didn’t move in with him?”

 “I did. I just needed a place close to the hospice to crash after a long shift. All my stuff is also here. Why move out?”

 “Makes sense, ma’am,” Volkov said. “But you didn’t stay here on the day of the murder, did you? You went straight to your husband’s apartment complex. You said previously that you arrived there at 6am, after working overnight. Why?”

 She stubbed the cigarette and Volkov wondered if she was getting nervous at last.

 

“I wanted to see him.”

 “That’s it?”

 “That’s it.”

 “How close were you with Mr. Marino?” he asked.

 “What do you mean?” — the woman pressed her lips together in distaste. — “He was my husband!”

 Volkov gave her a vulturous smile, “I’ve known people who were married for a lifetime and didn’t speak a word to each other in decades.”

 “You don’t have to mince words, detective,” she said looking out of the window. “I’ve heard it all: gold digger, leech, whore. Don’t dance around the subject: what are you really asking?”

 “Did you marry him for money?”

 “No, I loved him,” she said, meeting the detective’s eyes directly. “Still love.”

 Something in the way she said the last phrase sounded off, but he couldn’t pinpoint it straight away and filed it for later.

 “You don’t seem shocked by his death though,” Volkov leaned in closer, putting his elbows on his knees, a move to make the other uncomfortable enough to let something slip out.

 Marino’s widow made a deep breath as if starting a rehearsed speech, “My dear detective, after half a lifetime as a hospice nurse, I’m impossible to shock with a death. I’ve seen it all: blood, shit, pus, vomit. I started as an ass-wiper for the bedridden, and I was a damn excellent ass-wiper. They would've lined up to get their asses wiped if they could. Then, bedsores, feeding tubes, tracheostomas. I did my job and I did it well. That’s part of the reason I didn’t leave my job after Vito married me. I can help them meet a dignified end and I will do so for as long as I'm needed.”

 Volkov’s phone dinged. 

 *Finally, took you long enough,* he thought. 

 “That’s very admirable, Mrs. Marino,” he said, giving her some space. “I’m sorry, my partner is outside, I’ll just explain to him how to find your apartment.”

 

He quickly typed the message back, keeping an eye on the woman in the corner of his eye. Giving a witness a break sometimes revealed a crack in the surface. 

 But she was giving him nothing still.

 “Can you tell me more about your responsibilities at work?” Volkov asked.

 “Ask and I will answer,” she shot back. “As long as it doesn’t break the confidentiality of my patients.”

 “Certainly,” he said. He picked up this word from Schmidt and used it instead of his usual ‘ok’ to sound less intimidating before leaping at the prey when it least expected. “Did you have to administer opioids to your patients?”

 “Yes, dozens of times a day,” Mrs. Marino answered without a delay. “Morphine is the most common one but with the dying patients we used stronger stuff, too.”

 She wasn’t budging.

 “How many people have you watched die?” Volkov pressed. He needed this lady to give him *something.*

 “Too many to count, detective,” she picked up the pack of cigarettes again and flicked the lighter several times. It failed to light up. “Too many to count.”

 “Who was the most memorable?” he asked, offering her his own cheap plastic one that worked on the first try.

 “My mom,” Mrs. Marino said, directly meeting his gaze over the smoldering end of the cigarette. 

 “Oh.”

 “Yes, detective. ‘Oh’ indeed.”

 She inhaled a big drag and held it in for a couple of seconds before continuing, “Because I’d been in good books they let me check her in and even gave me a good discount. In the end, she didn’t cost them much, though. The cancer killed her in weeks.”

 “I’m sorry to hear that,” Volkov said, remembering how long ago he texted his own mom.

 

A doorbell tore the heavy silence in the room and Milena Marino stirred up a cloud of smoke between them as she stood up to let Schmidt in. 

 Seeing officer Paddock this morning wasn’t the only reason Michael Schmidt was late. Knowing they would be interrogating the key witness, he’d put extra effort into appearing put-together. He knew the effect he had on people, especially women. Today, he took advantage of the warming weather and chose a pristine white shirt under the uniform jacket that nicely hugged his shoulders. And, to complete the outfit, a small addtitional ace up his sleeve.

 To his disappointment, though, Mrs. Marino seemed to be immune to his charms. His brilliant smile at the doorstep failed to reflect back on her own face. His tried and trusted trick with stealing a glance at the woman’s ring finger and making sure she noticed it also fell flat.  Schmidt took these signals as a sign of genuine mourning.

 The widow stalled at the door and he went in to see his partner in the living room. After a quick greeting nod towards Jim, he was in full-on scanning mode, taking in every single detail, the furniture and the cigarette stubs on the coffee table, all while their owner was making her way back to the living room.

 “The DNA matches,” Schmidt mouthed before she was in the hearing distance.

 Mrs. Marino didn’t look sufficiently flustered to Volkov’s taste. Schmidt, on the contrary, couldn’t look more optimistic.

 “My partner, detective Volkov, has started without me,” he smiled again. “I’m sure you are sick of him already, so we’ll keep it brief.”

 Mrs. Marino signed, “That’s what he promised me yet here we are.”

 A quick glance towards Volkov confirmed his worst suspicions: this interrogation wasn’t going the way it was supposed to. Jim shrugged.

 “Then I will cut to the chase,” Schmidt said, leaning back on the coach: his way of being annoying to the witness was completely opposite from Volkov’s. “The blood on the crime scene belongs to Vito Marino. But according to our experts, there was too much of it. AND there’s no body. Do you think someone staged his death?”

 Marino’s widow looked almost bored. She wrapped her cardigan tighter around herself and said without any affect, “I hope so, to be honest. I hope he had done it himself, really. I hope he’s alive still, just hiding. I can’t keep losing people like that.”

 

Volkov’s accusatory glance didn’t bother Schmidt at all. The younger detective persisted, “If it was him, why would he do this? Did he have enemies? Debt problems? Did he receive any threats?”

 He leaned back even more and even put his elbows over the back rest, sinking in further, as if chatting about a game he watched, and not pressing the witness about a bloody murder. Volkov stole a look at Schmidt’s grey jacket that clung to his shoulders for dear life and then… saw *them* .

 Schmidt was wearing suspenders.

 Suddenly, the room felt hot like a sauna. Volkov’s hearing went offline as he stared back at Mrs. Marino with an undoubtedly horrifying unblinking stare.

 *Don’t get hard here*, *not now,* he thought.

 What spurred Schmidt to make such a ridiculous fashion choice that morning was unclear. But Volkov knew that if he saw the way these strips run down Mike’s chest and clasp his waistband, it would be the end of him.

 “What are you getting if he was indeed murdered, Mrs. Marino?” Schmidt’s voice barely registered in Jim’s brain like a faint echo. 

 “Very little,” she answered and looked back at Volkov as if looking for support but was taken aback by his intense eye contact. “I— I… almost nothing. His will was mostly the rest of his family and a couple of charities.”

 “So you didn’t sign a prenup,” Schmidt pressed. 

“Yes! Yes I didn’t!” she finally raised her voice, taking Volkov out of his trance. “And I’m tired of everyone assuming I married him because of the money! My dad and mom always said love matters more than wealth!” 

 Jim’s intuition perked up through the veil of out-of-place arousal. Something was going on with the way she talked, but what exactly…

 Schmidt didn’t seem to notice it, though. He saw that his approach was working and switched gears to confuse her further, “Please describe the morning of the murder from your perspective, minute by minute.”

 Mrs. Marino’s fingers finally started shaking and she clasped them together to make it less obvious.

 “How long did that take?” Schmidt asked, returning to his normal sitting posture. The offending suspenders hid from the view.

 *Thank god,* Volkov thought.

 “I don’t know… A minute? Five minutes? Definitely not enough to murder my own husband!” — the woman finally snapped and a steely glint returned to her tired eyes. — “Now if you’ll excuse me, detectives, I need some time alone. Please see yourselves out.”

 Schmidt looked satisfied.

 “Certainly,” Mike’s smile earned him a scowl from Mrs. Marino. “You are not a suspect, Milena, so we can’t insist you talk to us. But please stay in touch in case we need more information.” 

Both detectives knew what Milena Marino heard was “You are not a suspect *yet.*”

Now, he made it clear during the date he wanted to see me and I found myself to be extremely attracted to him, his values etc.

Since then he's asked to see me again, I gave him two days this week and we agreed on Friday. He's asked me twice what the plans are....to which I said I'm happy to do anything. I'm really wanting him to plan this one especially because I'm making the journey to him this time.

It's Wednesday and I haven't heard anything from him today.

I'm confident I'll get a message tomorrow but I'm not really gaging whether he's genuinely interested/very shy/ has no clue what to plan??

1k0uwdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k0uwdz/aitah_for_demanding_my_family_to_respect_our_own/,"AITAH for ""demanding"" my family to respect our own house/visiting rules?","Back story:

So - my mom and my boyfriend (30M) got off of the wrong foot all in the beginning because of different viewpoints. 
We've now been together for 4 years.
My boyfriend got 1-2 years into our relationship diagnosed with ADHD. My boyfriend struggle with being social all the time, and he's an introvert. 
But he's the most amazing man I have ever met, and I love him dearly.
We live together in a house in the same small city as my mom and my big sister.
I (25F) grew up in a household where it was normal just showing up at a family members doorstep and sort of expect to get invited in for a cup of coffee and a chat. No phonecall beforehand or a text message, nothing. 
Just showing up out of nowhere. 

My family expects me to have the same open door ""policy"" as they have, and as I have grown up in. I don't like it and neither does my boyfriend. I get extremely stressed, either because the house isn't clean or just the feeling of expectation from them. And my boyfriend doesn't like the unexpected visits either, cause he gets overwhelmed due to his ADHD. And to be honest, I also just like the fact that I know someone is coming by. 
My family is not open to the idea of me not doing it the way they want me to.
I like having a home, where I feel safe and secure, and I feel like they're stepping over my boundaries when they don't respect me and my partners wishes. They call it:""not normal"" to feel this way. 

My mom and big sister mocks my boyfriend with his ADHD and they lack respect for the both of us. They get angry if my opinions doesn't align with theirs. My mom has directly told my little sister, that stress wasn't something I had, it was just something I told myself I had. 
My mom is just for some reason against all diagnoses and refuses to listen or understand anything about them - to her they just don't exist. 

If my partner is overwhelmed and doesn't feel like going to a social event with my family (of 36 people in total) but I end up going, they always ask where he is, and then when I tell them the truth about it, they just shut me down with:""I don't want to talk about sicknesses and diagnoses all the time!"" But they always ask? 

They always share their opinions about it, and making it about them. That he doesn't like them, or that they don't feel prioritized, or they're not welcome here.. But when I then try explaining things, they just shut me down all the time.

Sorry for the long back story, but then you get the picture. 

So the other day I got into a conversation with my mom, and it went very well, she even agreed with the fact that if we hadn't lived in the same town as them, they probably would have called before showing up. We ended with coming up with a compromise. I/we get better at inviting them, and they get better at calling/typing before showing up. But then when the conversation was about to end, I literally stood getting ready to take my purse and get my jacket - my stepdad comes out of the bathroom meddling and got angry saying how they're not welcome at our place, that my dad can't even get invited over when he's in Denmark (which isn't true), and that he can't believe how disrespectful it is to not live up to how I myself grew up, with the open door policy in my mom's house. 
And my mom meddled in the conversation saying: ""do you understand what he's saying?"" And I was like: ""Yeah, I understand, but I don't agree, and I don't like when people yell at me like that.."" And then he just started talking about how I disrespected him in his home and that he could just be like my boyfriend.. And I was like: ""Okay?"" And then he said:""Fine! Then I'm going to ask you to leave!"" 
So I took my stuff and I left.. Haven't talked to him since, and haven't been by or invited them over. I feel like it is an endless struggle to find common ground. 

So am I really the AH for asking/""demanding"" my family to respect me and my partners wishes/rules according to our own home? 
And in general for wishing they'd be more respectful and open in the way they communicate? ",5,1744836136.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

I met my dad for coffee on April 11th. I told him how I felt about my brother, that david isn't allowed around my children and I don't want to have anything to do with him. My dad respected my decision, he admits my mom hasn't been around david enough to understand what he's like and what my dad has to deal with on a almost daily base (verbal abuse, misuse of medication, constant paranoia behavior, constantly hospital visits from not taking care of his diabetes).

I called my mom and told her I wasn't visiting, she didn't take it well as expected. Saying I always had it out for david, I always thought low of him and have so much hate in my heart that I need to turn to God. I didn't take it personal, iv accepted that my brother has middle child syndrome and will always be my parents ""special little boy who could do no wrong.""

Iv changed the date for the cabin for my older brother to use it when he goes to visit my mom, I have inlaws coming to visit this weekend and honestly, I'm looking forward to a quiet week off work doing things that I want to do.

Thank you to everyone who had awesome advice and gave me the words the say to my parents. My husband has been amazing and even told me he's been trying to tell me the exact same things as all you have for the last 6 years but I guess I needed to actually see an outside perspective.

About two years ago, on July 1st 2023, I was having a normal day at home, just doing stuff around the house. I was walking through the hallway and all the sudden both my hands began to stiffen and become extremely painful. I was home alone at the time, but was somehow able to unlock my phone and call my gf. I put her on speaker and told her what was happening, and at this point I felt like I couldn’t breathe correctly and I was going to faint. The pain in my hands had also spread to both my forearms and elbows, making my arms stiff as well. Thankfully, my gf was able to rush home and get me to the ER. Once there, they admitted me and made sure I wasn’t having a heart attack by doing an EKG and X Ray. They told me they think it was a panic attack, told me to get in touch with my primary and sent me on my way. Fast forward to October 2nd 2023. My gf and I had woke up at 3am and couldn’t go back to sleep, so we were watching tv and were about to make coffee when suddenly my arms and hands began to form into fists and curl into my chest. It was in such an intense and painful way that I was screaming for her to call 911. While waiting for the ambulance, she tried to walk me out to the living room, but I was unable to and half the side of my face went numb and I couldn’t speak correctly, like I was having a stroke. Once the paramedics arrived, they tried to pull my arms away from my chest to take vitals, but were unable to do so. So they told my gf to drive me to the hospital.. which I still don’t understand. But, we did as they said and once we arrived, I was treated the exact same way. Told I had a panic attack and that’s it. Since then, I have seen numerous specialist, doctors, done tests, etc. and still have no answers, except for possibly fibromyalgia, which I don’t agree with. I still deal with the arm and hand pain, stiffness, feeling faint, unable to use my arms and hands at times, feeling like my arms and hands are tingling (like how a body part feels after it falls asleep) everyday and throughout the day. Thankfully, I haven’t had any more ER visits, but I also avoid them at all costs. So if anyone has any advice or anything, please comment or send me a message.

I feel a little cheated here. After dating for approximately 8 months we moved in together. I had most of the stuff to furnish our place aside from a couch, which we ended up getting one for free from a lady I worked with. Grant came with the clothes on his back. He had been single for years before we met and eventually hit it off. He is a very kind, generous, and loyal person.  We struggle sometimes to communicate but have been actively working on it. We are going on 2y of living together now and looking around our place I realized that I have bought absolutely everything we needed after moving in. As I said we got a free couch, I had a bed and frame, ample kitchen and bathroom stuff, a kitchen table and some other miscellaneous stuff. He brought his clothes, and later his mom ended up giving him a dresser and armoire which we use regularly. Since then, every thing we’ve discussed about needing, I’ve ended up buying. With him saying he will pay me back but then never does.  This includes a pool and patio furniture set, a lamp, bedside tables, a coffee table, some art as well as me paying 90% of groceries. On top of that, I’m paying half of the household bills. To be clear we make the same amount of money monthly (about 6000 a month each). Last year I had noticed his spending habits were pretty irresponsible so I suggested we sit down and work on a budget. We did so, and after looking at our expenses, I see we only spend about 4000 each on our budgeted purchases/ bills. This left me curious as to where the other 2000 a month of his is going.  (I have multiple savings accounts I contribute to with my extra money including rrsp, tfsa, fhsa, and I put any extra in my regular savings account). Meanwhile, he never seems to have any extra money, has 0 savings, and has even asked me to loan him money for “bills” which I 50% of the time get repaid for. I’m annoyed because while I am invested in our future, I don’t see him putting in the same effort. Also.. I’m 14 years younger than him and somehow more financially responsible and invested in our future. Whenever I bring this issue up with him he gets sulky and says that I don’t understand, I’m just not sure what there is to understand?? To be clear, he is a wonderful person who, aside from this, is a perfect gentleman and helps a ton around the house and with yard work etc. It makes me feel like maybe I’m being unreasonable for getting upset at the financial part of our relationship. After letting it go for the last couple years, I got quite upset the other night and told him I’m not sure if our relationship is going to work out. Am I giving up a good thing because of petty reasons?? I’m feeling so lost here. Any input would be greatly appreciated, and if anyone has questions I would happily answer. Thanks Reddit.

Some background: I (31f) have seen my brother, David (32m), go down a rabbit hole of financial debt with his girlfriend of 4 years, Abby (31f). My brother started dating her near the end of the first year of the pandemic when he had no job and was on unemployment.( I felt like he shouldn't be dating at all because my mother and I were financially helping him to take his gf out on dates by giving him roughly $500 of month along with his $600+ unemployment. Was I peeved about it? Yeah. ). He was going out with her pretty regularly. Within a year, we ended up finally meeting her in person. Considering we were close in age, I thought I would be able to get to know her, but she never talked to me. I thought, ""Maybe this is the honeymoon stage still?"" so I waited for her to kinda integrate herself with the family. She was over every other weekend, sleeping on the couch in the living room, having breakfast with us, and going out with us to eat. 



At first, I thought this was fine and that we were going to eventually get to know each other. Anytime I tried to have conversations with her, she would ignore me by getting engrossed in her phone. I mean at any point: breakfast conversation, watching TVand trying to ask her if she had seen the movie yet, even on weekends when we hung out with friends in a group and my brother brought her along. I was ignored. I thought ""Okay, maybe she just doesn't like me?"" so I kinda cooled it off trying to get her involved in my conversations....But I noticed she was doing the same thing to my mother. Near the end of the 2nd year of their relationship, my brother tells me that she is highly jealous and has cut off most, if not all, of his female friends (including those he's known since grade school). Although most were chill, mutual friends of ours expressed their disappointment and wondered about the state of the relationship. Eventually, my brother confided in me again about Abby: she suffered a pretty bad breakup with a guy who cheated on her. ""Oh, so she has trust issues?"" is what I thought until David told me that she was 1)still in contact with her ex and 2) he was paying for a video subscription service for her out of 'guilt.' That rubbed me the wrong way. He then told me she would go regularly to movies with her male friends....which really pissed me off. How come he had to cut off female friends when she was allowed to be with guys at the movies? 

Their 3rd year was probably the worst of it all. Although her hypocrisy was a nuisance, I couldn't tell my brother to just break up with her because ultimately, HE is in the relationship, not me. So when Abby started dropping hints about wanting to get married while in our house (saying this like ""I am the marrying kind."" ""Gotta lock it down if you want me."" ""You can't tell me what to do because I don't see a ring on my finger."" ) I started getting worried. I asked my brother if he even saw their relationship in that way, and he said he was comfortable just 'dating' for now, as he just got a new job and wanted a place of his own. Cool. I thought maybe he had intentions about what to do with their relationship, and maybe they WOULD grow together, how he had hoped...until the money borrowing started happening more frequently.

 It would be a few dollars here and a few dollars there for transportation or maybe a coffee treat. Until it became ""Hey, i need help with rent"" and ""I'm taking care of someone's pet, can you send me money for food"" and ""I dont feel like taking the bus can you send me money for an uber?"" suddenly my brother's savings were in the constant state of zeros. She didn't only do it to my brother, but also to my mom. When we would go out to lunch, she wouldn't pitch in, or she would get an entree and 3 extra sides. Don't get me wrong, my brother is a big guy, and I am chubby myself, but our bill would go from $60 for just the three of us to twice as much when she was there. It was like ""Girly...we are willing to pay for A MEAL, not a whole feast."" My brother had to eventually start asking me for money, mind you: I lost my really well-paying job in 2021 and have only been freelancing/temporary work until I get a full-time job, so my income is infrequent and very much NOT a lot, for gas and lunch with his gf. 

Last year, her biggest financial ask happened where she requested he take out a LOAN for one of her animals that made his credit score drop drastically, and she promised him that she would pay him back, only to call a month or less later for him to take out yet ANOTHER loan for the same reason. (fyi she has the lowest of the low credit score, so she can't get a loan or credit card at all.) He is now currently $2K in debt from her alone (he also has debt regarding his car and other things), which isn't a lot, but for a guy trying to build savings, it makes him feel desperate with his finances. 

She hasn't paid him back yet, and interest has already started to pile up on the loans, and now they have a date coming up at an amusement park(her request) that could potentially put him in the red even more. So, WIBTA to call my brother's GF out and make her pay him back by saying she needs to think about her financial actions before trying to make any more plans of going out or should I just stay out of it and leave this all to my brother to deal with?

We were both struggling with caffeine timing—I'm super sensitive (even green tea late in the day wrecks me), and she can fall asleep after coffee but noticed her *sleep quality* took a hit.

So I built a simple browser-based calculator that works backward from your bedtime to find your personal caffeine cutoff time.

It factors in:

* Caffeine sensitivity (slider or personalization quiz)
* Earlier caffeine intake (stacking logic)
* A stricter “Sleep Priority” mode
* Visual caffeine decay graph

It’s built in vanilla JS and hosted on S3. No accounts, no backend, everything runs locally.

Right now I'm experimenting with early growth: SEO, blog content, and soft sharing on Reddit + Twitter.

Curious how other solo builders are handling early traction and distribution for small wellness tools like this.

We are very close and hang out outside of school very frequently. We agreed to meet each other for a couple hours to study for our ap test. For context: every month my parents give me 100-200 dollars on a credit card so I can budget out what i’m going to spend for the month and D has been asking me almost every. single. day if I can get her coffee before school as I go very frequently. I’m going to be honest it does bother me that she asks all the time considering she has a bigger amount of money than me and she could easily just go get one herself before school and she never offers to pay me back. So knowing this, I asked her if she could pay for the food at our hang out since I got her about 5 coffees this month without being payed back. She agreed at first and then said she couldn’t anymore because she needs to buy a different friend a birthday present. I told her that my monthly allowance had run out and that I couldn’t go anymore. She seemed annoyed but I didn’t want to ask if she was upset or bring up that I was upset. I feel like it’s very selfish that she asks me for coffee almost every day but then won’t pay for our most likely 20 dollar meal. She also asks other people for coffee when I say no and I feel really used just because I drive to school and she has a license and a car but her dad drives her. 


UPDATE: she reluctantly agreed to pay after I told her I couldn’t go if she wasn’t paying and to answer some questions: the coffees are about 7 dollars each and I do get myself one too when I get her one and to be clear she has had my back in the past and payed for  big expensive meals once or twice when I really had no money she hasn’t been asking for the coffees for very long only about a month or so .

It’s incredibly demoralizing to constantly want or need something—something small, something normal—and have to tell yourself no over and over again. Not because you’re being responsible, but because you simply cannot afford it. It chips away at you. 

Being in Salt Lake City without a job or a place to call home has been humbling in ways I never expected. Days blur together. You start to miss the smallest things—privacy, a fancy meal, a living room to sit and watch tv in, a fun date, a coffee stop. Lately, it’s been weighing heavier on me than ever.

I’ve been applying to jobs nonstop. Tweaking resumes, writing cover letters, following up, networking everything they say you’re supposed to do. And still… nothing. Every rejection chips away at what little hope is left.

Meanwhile, the bills don’t stop. The debt piles up. It’s like drowning in slow motion watching everything around you fall apart while trying to stay calm enough to keep going. I can’t afford healthcare, so stress just sits in my chest like a ticking clock. I’m literally driving on no car insurance and a suspended license which is irresponsible and illegal but I need to get to places for certain resources. A lot of places are not accessible from where I’m at on foot. 

It’s frustrating how hard it is to ask for help when you know everyone else is struggling too. I don’t even know what I’m looking for anymore just tired of pretending like it’s fine when it isn’t.

About two years ago, on July 1st 2023, I was having a normal day at home, just doing stuff around the house. I was walking through the hallway and all the sudden both my hands began to stiffen and become extremely painful. I was home alone at the time, but was somehow able to unlock my phone and call my gf. I put her on speaker and told her what was happening, and at this point I felt like I couldn’t breathe correctly and I was going to faint. The pain in my hands had also spread to both my forearms and elbows, making my arms stiff as well. Thankfully, my gf was able to rush home and get me to the ER. Once there, they admitted me and made sure I wasn’t having a heart attack by doing an EKG and X Ray. They told me they think it was a panic attack, told me to get in touch with my primary and sent me on my way. Fast forward to October 2nd 2023. My gf and I had woke up at 3am and couldn’t go back to sleep, so we were watching tv and were about to make coffee when suddenly my arms and hands began to form into fists and curl into my chest. It was in such an intense and painful way that I was screaming for her to call 911. While waiting for the ambulance, she tried to walk me out to the living room, but I was unable to and half the side of my face went numb and I couldn’t speak correctly, like I was having a stroke. Once the paramedics arrived, they tried to pull my arms away from my chest to take vitals, but were unable to do so. So they told my gf to drive me to the hospital.. which I still don’t understand. But, we did as they said and once we arrived, I was treated the exact same way. Told I had a panic attack and that’s it. Since then, I have seen numerous specialist, doctors, done tests, etc. and still have no answers, except for possibly fibromyalgia, which I don’t agree with. I still deal with the arm and hand pain, stiffness, feeling faint, unable to use my arms and hands at times, feeling like my arms and hands are tingling (like how a body part feels after it falls asleep) everyday and throughout the day. Thankfully, I haven’t had any more ER visits, but I also avoid them at all costs. So if anyone has any advice or anything, please comment or message me.

The type of girl I'm looking for:
- within the ages of 22yr - 35yr.
- someone who perhaps wants start out slow and vibe it out first. After all if we don't click then neither of us will have fun.
- someone who is a little fit, I don't mind a little to grab but am looking to speak to someone about that has fitness goals, so perhaps we can reinforce each other's goals.
- patient, welcoming and looking to work together.
- loves to get a lil touchy.

I just moved to this city for a new job and was extremely busy with the transition so we didn’t wind up going on our first date until late February. It was a coffee date and it went really well. We talked for hours. At the end of the date as we were saying goodbye to each other he ask “can I give you a kiss?” And of course I said “sure!” It was really cute and romantic. 

We texted throughout the week and had some loose plans for another date. We couldn’t make Friday work but he told me he was free that Saturday after 8pm. Saturday rolls around and he sends me a text when he got done. He was hinting that he was tired so I gave him an out saying “hey! If you’re too tired we can do something tomorrow or during the week. No pressure at all” to which he said “I really don’t want to take you up on that because you’ve already been so accommodating and understanding. But I might have to. I don’t want to be totally dead tomorrow”. He was working the next day so I understood. He said he would be done around 3-4pm on Sunday though. I said “okay! Just lmk when you’re done with work and if you still want to do something tomorrow” to which he said “oh I 100% do”. He texted me about an hour later saying “hot damn you’re cute!”  

Sunday rolls around and I don’t hear from him until 8pm when I text him to say I hope that he’s okay and he responds saying he fell asleep 1hr into his 5hr nap and that he was embarrassed. No apology. I left him on delivered until two days later he asked me “so, did I strike out on this?” 

I let him know that I felt kind of stood up and he apologized. Said he was still interested in going on a 2nd date and I said I was too. 

He said it would have to be after he got back from a trip he was going on to which I said “okay no problem. Just let me know when you’re back and if you’re still feeling up for it and we can figure something out. Have fun!”

Never got a response from him. He left me on delivered. This was over a month ago. 

My concern is that I think I might have overreacted when he asked if he struck out since we didn’t have firm plans on Sunday and that I might have scared him off.

Do you think it’s worth it to send a text apologizing for my reaction mentioning something like “I’m still interested in seeing where this could go if you see but if not I completely understand”?

It said in her profile she was looking for long term relationship and wanted kids one day. We started messaging back and forth over the course of a week and i asked her out to coffee. She said yes and we agreed to a date. However, then she asked me what i was looking for in someone and my expectations. 

I'm 33 and she was 29 so i figured there's no point in playing games. I tried to explain in a light-hearted way that i was looking for a long term adventure partner and life partner if im totally honest. I told her i wanted kids one day as well. I also said that i'm in no rush but i'll only date someone i'm serious about. Then i asked her what she was looking for. I tried my best to be totally honest, answer the big questions in a fun but serious way. She didn't reply and just unmatched me. I'm feeling pretty confused to be honest. My profile also says i want kids and a long term relationship so i feel like i didn't say anything she probably wouldn't know already. Now i'm wondering if being too honest can scare somebody away? I made a terrible mistake? Or i should have acted more mysterious for example. 

*Does saying you're looking for a LTR/life partner scare people away (generally)?*

 Since she was 29 and wanted kids, i assumed that naturally she would probably be taking dating serious as well and might even appreciate that i could be totally honest with her. But I've also heard that a little bit of ""games"" are required to ignite attraction otherwise being too honest can scare people away/ looks needy? (seems crazy to me - i would judge all this on how the person acts in real life). Maybe i'm overthinking things but i don't know how to process this.

I feel a sense of regret, as if it's partly my fault and that it was actually in my control to get the outcome i wanted (a simple date). Deep down i think that she was actually serious about wanting a long term partner too, but somehow, despite that, if i had played a little bit more mysterious it might have played out differently? The messages up to this point suggested genuine interest and desire so to have things go great then drop off a cliff is confusing.

The conundrum feels like : ""Wanting something serious? Great. Talking about wanting something serious too soon? Now it’s suddenly “too much.”?

Thanks for any genuine advice :) I'm well aware that ofc some women will be scared and some women won't. But is there a way to be honest AND air on the side of ""mystery"" which might prevent killing attraction?",1,1744835069.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

1k0uben,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1k0uben/is_my_new_doctor_overreacting_suddenly_ordering/,"Is my new doctor overreacting? Suddenly ordering infusions, injections, calling me to come in twice a week...?","At my appointment, she told me she had never seen lab numbers like mine before and that I was only still standing because I'm young.  Either I'm sicker than I thought, she really REALLY cares, my previous docs have been underconcerned, or something else is going on. I will give more info:

32F, 5'4 150lbs, take lamictal and pristiq for bipolar (stable 6 years) and vyvanse+adderall booster to treat adhd.

The new doc has a small private practice and seems very old school - no patient portal, appointments handwritten on a paper calendar, etc. I thought she was great and very confident albeit intense. She is an immigrant from somewhere in Eastern Europe and I found her personality to be comforting (reminds me of my own upbringing), so I worry my trust is biased.

Her staff called the next day for me to ""come in asap."" I had them email my results and it showed a few deficiencies but nothing wildly concerning. I got them to delay my follow up by a few days, so I resumed my supplements and saw her a week later.

She did say most values were normal, but emphasized that I was profoundly anemic and must have been for years (same with vitamin B12 and D). She was also very concerned about my wbc and neutrophils indicating that I had a bacterial infection somewhere, and she was upset that I couldn't remember feeling sick last week. Perhaps my body was inflamed or fighting something and I had no symptoms? But she was pretty insistent.

She also gave me a B12 injection and prescribed 4 more rounds for me to inject at home, plus a preauth for my insurance to approve 5 iron infusions. She told me it would take years to feel better on just supplements.  She took more labs and a urine sample and scheduled me for six weeks out.

But today she called again for me to come back tomorrow! I'll post my abnormal readings below, please can someone tell me if this is a normal reaction...? I've heard iron infusions are hard to come by so maybe I'm lucky that she's so serious? I'm usually pretty compliant but I'm getting nervous and confused about all of the disruption.

Iron total (40-190): 26  
Ferritin (16-154): 6

WBC (3.8-10.8): 12.8  
Hemoglobin (11.7-15.5): 11.4  
MCV (80-100): 78.7  
MCH (27-33): 23.6  
MCHC (32-36): 30  
Absolute neutrophils (1500-7800): 9242

Vit D (30-100): 21  
Vit B12 (200-1100): 211

edit: got new results as I was posting this. Now WBC is 11.6 and Neutrophils are down to 7552, but Platelets (140-400) are 428

Urine shows ""many"" calcium oxalate crystals. Kidney stone risk? I've been dehydrated and drinking a lot of coffee/tea.

Also UTI??? Trace leukocyte esterase, high squamous epithelial cells (10-20)? I've had no symptoms but I have a feeling she'll be concerned, but is it a good thing for a doctor to be so involved??",1,1744834674.0,AskDocs,2,0.67,False
1k0uass,https://www.reddit.com/r/SettingBoundaries/comments/1k0uass/boundary_with_overbearing_trauma_dumping_colleague/,Boundary with overbearing trauma dumping colleague,"I really would appreciate some advice. I met a woman at work (I am also female) and it felt like we had some things in common although I could tell immediately she was a bit clingy and anxious but I felt a bit sorry for her too. when I look back it's crazy. the first thing she told me was a family member had terminal cancer. Now I have sadly more than one experience of losing family members to this and I know how hard it is to come in to work daily when you are losing a loved one so I did offer to be a support in that regard. But that escalated and how. We ended up working in the same team, and every day she would suggest a coffee but it was never a coffee like I would describe a coffee break. it was an outpouring of loads of stuff, the cancer stuff, the self harming details of another family member (in detail), loads of moaning about her partner and how she wants a divorce and describing her sex life with her husband. I absolutely never invited any of this (Other than i knew about losing loved ones to cancer plus my husband went through treatment too).

Then just daily minutae of her life, whether she slept well, whether her daughter slept well, what they had for dinner, a total stream of consciousness . then at work meetings she always brought my name up unexpectedly, saying I worked 'ever so hard' in a  patronising  and infantilising way. During this time I had a biopsy of my own, to this day she never asked how it went. I dont think she knows a thing about me.

Because of the terminal cancer diagnosis she was often close to tears or crying although very cheery to everyone else so I really felt unable to stop her or set a boundary. Then we had to work closely on a project and I realised she is quite incompetent, I again tried to help but found her quite angry if she didn't understand then one day she just blamed me at a team meeting when she was challenged  on why she hadn't completed a task. I absolutely was not to blame and thankfully my manager saw through that.

i am actually quite easy going and independent, but I soon felt she wanted me involved in everything with her. I had to withdraw last October and slowly realised YES i failed to set boundaries but also this person just blatantly has none and I feel like I was manipulated and I feel angry.

i did speak to a manager and I think they can see there is a problem so now I am assigned tasks that give me a break from her, but recently everything changed again and I'm back working closely with her.

She dominates every team meeting and often is saying things that are wrong or repeating back what other people say, I honestly feel violated by her and like she is living in my head. That is the first boundary I have to set, the one in my head. I also have to set work boundaries here and I bought the workbook recommended here.

what is really weird is since I withdrew she has never asked me once what is up. I sure as hell would. I remember once she told me she makes friends then they all distance themselves from her. I can see why, but now I'm essentially ghosting a colleague and that is not right. I need to fix this in that i want to be able to behave normally while at work. I have no interest in personal chat with her, just work.

Please any advice would be great. thank you for reading so far",3,1744834632.0,SettingBoundaries,0,1.0,False

1k0u9v8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0u9v8,Organic Konga 2 Yirgacheffe,"Hey gang!
I'm here to talk about these beans. I was able to extract the notes listed except the peach (I couldn't stop sipping and it was gone before it cooled off enough). 

If anyone here is a roaster, coffeebeancorral sells these green and they are phenomenal. 

Recipe I used:

20g coffee
300g water heater to 92°C

First pour 50g with Switch closed for 45 seconds then draw down

Second pour to 120g and let draw down almost completely

Third pour 80g in to 200g total and let draw down almost completely again

Last pour 100g in the center and let it finish.

The cup immediately feels more like tea (lighter body) and smells of vanilla and orange but more like a scone than the creamsicle sweet smell. Tastes of orange and bergamot and as I sipped and sipped it got towards the marmalade sweetness which is why I assume I didn't get the peach. Very enjoyable and I'm excited to try different brews and grinds to play with it and see if I can intensify flavors or sweeten it up more. 

I can't tell you how much you all have inspired me to get the crazier sounding coffees. Thank you all for sharing the co-ferments and Yirgacheffes and Pink Bourbons. I have some Pink Bourbons lined up for roasting next. ",8,1744834566.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

I have been using Hario V60 as my daily driver for the last 4-5 months. Recently I have purchased a Fellow Stagg X and I brewed 4 cups of coffee so far. For the recipe, I have used 15g of coffee grinded to a medium coarse setting (Same grind size as my V60). I use 195F water for my recipe. I use 50g of water for blooming and I do a swirl while blooming to make sure that all the coffee grounds are saturated. Then at the 0:45, I start pouring another 100g resulting 150g total weight and wait for 10 sec and then I pour the last 100g and a total of 250g. I also do a swirl at this point to make sure of a flat bed of coffee. The total draw down takes around 2:00-2:10. I also get a flat bed which I believe is pretty normal for a flat bottom brewer but the coffee is tasting bitter. What am I doing wrong here? or how can I make a perfect cup with this brewer? Your recommendation is much appreciated. Thanks.",1,1744834520.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I bought some gift cards and have been handing them out to the folks at my Joann's.  It isn't anything life changing, but I've been in their shoes and I know it can't hurt the situation.

Some backstory; about a year ago, my aunt 58F Betty (not her real name) was diagnosed with cancer. Shortly after that, her husband 68M passed suddenly. A month after that, she got evicted from her home. Her oldest son and his wife have been letting her and her dog stay with them since then. This past week, she got T-boned at an intersection and her only vehicle was written off. 

In the past year, I 28F have gone to visit her 3 times (not including the funeral visits) as I live about 7hrs away. This past visit I had with her, I could tell she was a bit happier then our last visit, but I know she is still struggling mentally and physically. I completely understand that things take time and some things will never be same. 

In the past year, I have door-dashed her coffees and some of her favorite snacks. I can't help contribute financially because I live very paycheck to paycheck.

She is the kind of person that has literally given the sweater off her back for a homeless stranger. She has always been the kind of person I hope to be one day and I want nothing more than for her to be happy and have a bit of comfort after the year she has endured. 

I feel as though I can be doing so much more to help her in her time of need, I just have no idea how. 

Is there anything I can do to help her, lift her spirits and potentially bring some happiness back into her life?",1,1744834383.0,relationship_advice,3,0.67,False

At this point it's kind of becoming clear that if I want a relationship, I'm probably going to have to do the initiating. (I'm not really counting dating apps here -- I've both asked people out and been asked out on apps, but that's nothing more than meeting a random person for coffee so it doesn't really feel like any stakes are involved and my app dates never went anywhere.) I was an ugly duckling as a kid and just got no romantic attention, now as an adult I'm slightly less ugly but men my age still don't seem to be interested (I do get my share of catcalling and men over 50 though :/).

I feel more comfortable meeting people irl but while I meet guys I would be interested in, I haven't been confident enough to ask them out.

I just don't really feel confident since I've never been in a relationship myself and feel like I have no clue how to ""lead"" especially when women usually aren't doing this part of it so my female friends can't really help me with advice either. A few female friends did ask out their partner irl but it was only after it was super obvious that they were both interested and the guy was just too shy. That isn't the case with me - the guys I meet tend to be really confident.

So far I have tried lower stakes invites that aren't asking the guy on a date specifically, like just asking to get lunch 1-1, go to the climbing gym and so on. those have been unsuccessful so far but people have told me that it could just be ambiguous since I didn't ask them on a date specifically. In a few cases I got confirmation that they knew what was up, and were turning me down for reasons, but not always.

I feel too intimidated to just go up to someone and be like ""hey I like you, want to go on a date with me"" when this just isn't the norm for women. I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing, and I also fear the rejection. I think part of me also still does want to feel kind of pursued and I need someone to knock sense into me that I need to stop wanting that I guess.
