1gebu36,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gebu36,New in the club.,"Hey everyone!

I'm a late-30s, 5'11"", 250-pound new dad who recently discovered the joy of rowing. I stumbled upon this subreddit while researching rowers and it's been a huge help.

I first tried a rower at an Airbnb and did a 16-minute HIIT workout. I was amazed at how energized I felt afterward, especially considering I'd only had one cup of coffee that day and was driving 4 hours home on 4 hours of sleep.

After a lot of research, I decided to invest in an Ergrow. At first, I was tempted by cheaper options from Chinese apps, but the support, challenges, and logbooks offered by concept2 were worth the extra cost.

I'm now three weeks into my rowing journey and I'm absolutely loving it!

Any tips or advice for a newbie rower?

I'm open to any suggestions or experiences you'd like to share. And if you're on the fence about getting one just do it!",1,1730146189.0,concept2,0,1.0,False

Like most of us here, I was living the classic life - wake up, solve DSA, apply to jobs, customize resume, repeat.  
The breaking point came during my 200th application.  
Here's where it gets interesting. Was ranting about this on our college Discord (as one does), and a senior suggested something different - one comprehensive technical [interview](http://apply.joinarena.ai/apply) that apparently gets sent to multiple companies automatically. Usually I ignore these ""revolutionary platform"" suggestions and I actually did.  
Placements toh naseeb nahi, CGPA ki lagi padi thii and here I was in the assumption ki companies bas CGPA dekar hire karti hai (its kinda true honestly)  
Anyway decided to give it a try cause I was out of options   
so you basically do ONE video interview that gets you considered for like 10,000 open roles automatically. Plus, your interview stays in their system, so as new jobs come up, you're automatically considered for those too.  
The weird part? Companies started reaching out first. Three interviews lined up now - actual technical roles, not those ""we want a full-stack developer who can also make coffee"" positions.   
Still grinding DSA for the final rounds though - no escaping that life üò≠

I had just graduated from college after three years of studying film production. I went it with the expection to become the next Spielberg, but I got humbled pretty much immediately. I know it's a cliche, but I got a job at a restaurant meanwhile I sent in my resume and some of my works made in college. I sent it to different studios and media companies. One evening, as I was getting ready for my shift at the local restaurant I suddenly got a call. Immediately I noticed that the number isn't an American one, but a foreign one. I'm vary of scam calls but after reading posts about how to troll scammers I decided to pick up the call. A man speaks to me in a heavy French accent and presented himself as Jack, although I suspect his real name was Jacques. 

""I am very impressed about your work"", he said and complimented me on some of my works from college.

""T-thanks"", I mumbled, a little shocked.

He told me a little about his production company. A french owned tv production group that create programmes, mostly documentaries, and broadcast them in several countries. He told me how he noticed my family name and asked me about it. I explained to him that I have some Lebanese roots.

""Ooh, tres bien"", Jack exclaimed, ""so I guess that you speak Arabic"".

I explained how I just know a few basic phrases, he hummed but told me to anyway come to the office the next day for an interview. I could bore you out with the details of my Golden Corral shift, or the car ride to the office a few miles afar from my parents house. But I won't do that. I'll get straight to the point.

I got hired. He explained that they were working on a documentary about some Lebanese pop diva and the cultural impact she has had on the Arab speaking world. I got to be the one who would produce and make this documentary.

Arriving in Beirut from a really long flight I was exhausted but at the Rafic Hariri airport a group of people in suits held up a big sign with my name and the French tv production company. I guess that part movies got right. They all greeted me with a lot of welcome in both english, arabic and french. As we got out of the airport I thought I would faint just from the heat itself. Coming from Rhode Island, this was a huge shock to my yankee body. I knew it was hot here, but not like this. 

""You'll get used to it"", says the woman, giggling, and I realise that she can tell my reaction to the temperature. She drives to the office and shows me to a room. One of the men that met me on the airport told me to have a seat, he brought some coffee and some snacks. He shows me some of their awards and shows me promos for all the different documentaries they've made.

""I'm very happy to have you here"", the man, Raad, says, ""So, you're part Lebanese?"", he asks with a faint accent. His english is extremely good.

""No, not really, it's just my grandpa"", I say and he looks a little disappointed. He's silent for a while.

""Well, Haifa knows english very well. She'll be delighted to work with you!"", he continues on.

""Haifa?"", I ask. Just because my grandpa was lebanese, I have no clue whatsoever about popular media in Lebanon.

""Haifa Wehbe. She's.."", he stops for a while, looking for words, ""controversial here, but in many ways a legend"".

After the meeting I go straight to my hotel room, turning on the AC and drink some soda pops with Arabic written on them. I search up Haifa Wehbe on my computer and I see a very pretty woman, dark haired and quite, well, bodacious. Let me tell you, all my stereotypes of arab women got crushed in an instant. She's showing off her cleavage and curves and I also see that she's a supporter of gay rights, even have her own clothing line with some pride accesories. I was quite shocked, mind you, but I realise that she must be the Lebanese equivalent of Britney Spears.

For some reason I was very nervous when I met her in person. It was in a fancy restaurant, she entered the door and what struck me was how genuienly nice she was. She waved and greeted everyone, including the servers. Some people wanted her autograph and wanted to take a selfie, she happily complied. Looking at this beautiful woman wearing a purple top, showing her cleavage, with tight leather tights, I shake her hand.

""Welcome to Lebanon, Jared!"", she says to me, ""I'm so delighted to meet you. I saw the film you made about the wildlife in Staten Island, I'm very impressed and honored to work with you!"".

""Woah"", I loudly exclaimed, ""Well, the pleasure is on my side"".

We're seated, the cameramen and all people working on the documentary and we get the menu. I look at all the different kind of dishes I've never heard before. French ones. Arabic ones. Very luxurious, not a trace of comfort food or mac and cheese. Everyone already set their mind on what they'll order, scallops, escargots, kibbeh.

""Jared, I can recommend mjadra if you want something real Lebanese"", she smiles at me so I order a plate of mjadra. 

""One for me too!"", Haifa exclaims. 

The food comes in and I start to scoop up some mjadra with some flat bread. Haifa talks about her career as a singer, she strikes me as really down to earth.

""Have you ever had Arak, it's on the house!"", a waiter comes by and tells us. He goes back into the kitchen and come out a few minutes later with a huge container of water, some ice cubes and a liquor bottle.   
""I'll show you!"", Haifa smiles and pours a little into my glass. I watch as it turns milk white with water. We all toast and eat. The Lebanese really love food and Haifa isn't shy. I don't want to be rude but I really don't like the mjadra. It's the lentils, they're undercooked. But Haifa is too polite and nice to complain. She even finishes my plate.

Suddenly, I start to feel a really bad smell in the restaurant. I sniff around the room to try to find the source, if there's some sewage leak in the bathroom. I notice Haifa is blushing when she see me sniffing. Hours are passing and the smell gets worse meanwhile I see how she kind of swirls around in the chair. 

About 2/3 of the Arak bottle in, Haifa invites us to our home. We take a limousine to a fancy villa, a maid shows us in.

""Jared, I'd like to give you a private tour"", she smirks at me. I can notice that she is drunk. It's in the way she talks and moves. She tells the rest of the team to feel at home, the maid serves them some snacks and coffee. ""I'll just have a word with Jared"", Haifa exclaims. She takes me to the upper floor and shows me inside a huge office.

  
***\*BAM!\****. I shrug back instinctively. The sound was so unexpected, and loud.

""Oops, I did it again"", she laughs, ""well, here is my office"", she shows me the desk with the computer and explains how she manages the finances in this room. I still can't forget the fart. Maybe it's the leather pants that made the fart sound so sharp, like a straight arrow through her intestines, almost like the fart didn't touch her anus even. And then, the smell.... Ugh. It smells really, really nasty. Like rotten sulfur. 

But Haifa feels apparently so comfortable around me. She walks me into a library and shows me her collection of Harry Potter books. 

***\*BWRAP!\****, another sharp and arrow farts. ""It's the mjadra you know"", she giggles and tell me about how she loves to read fantasy books, as well as LOTR. 

""I've always loved it, it's"", she freezes, like if you play freeze or that game in the Squid Game. ***\*BWAA-PAP-PAP-PAP-PAP\****. It's like the fart started out as a sharp arrow ripper but mid way through, it got bubbly. I could hear how wet and warm it was. If I could see her behind, I'd see some condensation on her tight leather pants where her anus is. ""ah, so interesting to explore the realms of human imagination"".

She really isn't shy or seem to even try to apologise for farting. But the smell is horrible. I can tell those uncooked lentils will give, if they already haven't, given her a gut rot. The putrid smell of farts that has been marinating inside the stomach and intestines, really absorbing all the funky aromas inside.

***\*PAP-PAP-PAP-PAP-PAP\****, ""Aaaah!"" she loudly moans. This time the fart sounds different. Now It's just bubbly. Small bubbles, quequeing out of the anus. I also see how she twirks. ""Pussy farts always tickles me"", she says and giggles. 

""You know Jared, you gotta get it all out, before we can start to film"", she says. The stench is unbearable and I go to the window to open them but she stops me mid way. ""No, don't do that. I want to save money on the heating bill"", she says. ""I know they stink, but don't they have a faint hint of garlic? You know, we love garlic in this country"".

I sniff in a little of the toxic fumes in the room and she rips another one. This time it sounds really deep and warm; ***\*BwwuuUUAAAH\****. Just as the sound is increasing, so does the fart itself. So there I am, stuck inside a sealed room with really horrible gut rot rippers. ""I have to let them all out before we start to film"", she reminds me, and lay out a huge drunken burp. Stuck with her farts, the stench. Stuck with a farting Arab pop diva.",1,1730145502.0,celebfartfantasies,0,1.0,False

As I was planning to go on a diet anyway, I almost complete quited sugar except the morning tea. That went for like 3 months and during a regional festival, I decided to have a cheat day and then the whole diet went down the drain. Since then, i have tried, multiple half hearted 'no chocolates'  'no sweets' and 'no junk food'. 

Around June-July this year, I was diagnosed with PCOD, doctor told me to loose weight as I was like 20 kg overweight. This time, I seriously started a sugar free diet, with 1-2 chocolate bars a month. It went well till August end, then again I decided to have a break and tho I just started with a little, the amount of sugar I consume in a day increased really quickly. 

From what I have found from my multiple observation, is that I can remain completly sugar free (except maybe morning tea/coffee with sugar) but I can't maintain a reasonable balance now. 

Any suggestions on how I can achieve a balance? 

Or I should try to just quit sugar altogether?

I'm currently planning a series of Science lessons for my primary class (Y5 Space) and referring to books such as Teaching Primary Science, as well as lesson inspo online, has reminded me once again of some of the 'investigations' that seem to happen in primary Science that just seem to be a huge faff, loads of resources and things to set up during lunch, make a mess, and the kids don't learn what they need to. 

Example: one suggested lesson from the above book requires a cold cup of coffee, a small amount of cream, several spoons, 10 lumps of clay, drawing spirals with pens onto half blown up balloons (among other stuff I can't remember) and all I can think is half my class would spill the stuff and not even understand what it's supposed to be showing (galaxies expanding, apparently). 

I totally understand the actual experiments we do, like the ones with making parachutes to test air resistance on materials etc, but things like the one I've mentioned above seem pointless to me and its probably easy for me to explain it to them and show a decent video than do all that stuff with coffee and balloons?!

Question - should I be doing the lessons with all the random resources to help them see things hands on or is it totally OK to just explain things and then ask them to draw a diagram?! I feel like I'm going mad reading some of the lesson ideas I see suggested",1,1730145186.0,TeachingUK,1,1.0,False

The use is main for a lot of teams chat, a lot ms windows shortcuts and a lot of ms excel shortcuts plus a bit of gaming on minecraft.

So let's talk layers and sorry for the long post.

**0. Base layer**

home row modifiers properly setup and most of the long press of thumb keys send you momentarily to another layer. outer thumb keys less common ones and inner ones the most common like navigation n mouse.

dedicated alt key for instant activation of menu selection or excel navigation and action like pressing alt h o i in sequence to provide auto fit column width.

again in excel ctrl+t to format as table in colemak is super fast with home row mods, middle finger holds ctrl and right next to it the index finger hits t.

ctrl+a to select all again in the home row.

in browser ctrl+r for refresh and ctrl+shift+r for hard refresh. super comfy in the home row.

2-3 key combos also live here for some special characters like ; which when pressed before a vowel in greek it provides the accented version of that letter like Œµ Œ≠.

special mention for the multilanguage people out there in TD(2) there is gui+space as tap to change with a single button the language. super handy for me.

usually the mid thumb key of the left hand returns me to base and when in base it changes the language. so even if i dont remember in which layer i am i can return to base easily.

mid thumb right goes with tap in numbers and in symbols permanently 

shortcuts of powertoys ctrl shift s for screenshot or ctrl shift c for the color picker across screen items are my most useds ones.

**1. Num layer**

home row modifiers also here

most common window navigation in ms windows by long pressing thumb when in base layer and then holding right gui with pinky on the right hand and then hitting 1-5 to open or switch to the first five apps in the taskbar. if i also hold shift then i create a new instance of that app.

in excel ctrl+1 to go to almost all properties of items.

and alt+= to auto sum

here you can see = +- \*/ in the bottom row of the right finger. super handy when doing quick calculations (story of my life in the financial parts of my job)

notice an abstract reordering of the right parts numbers where in order to be consistent with other layers and bring 0 to a stronger finger i had done some kind of pyramid that is easier for me to remember when touch typing.

added on the top row of left side the : character as it is typed in each language (eng-gr) in order be able to write time like 13:45 without changing layer or the need for language change when in this layer permanently.

**2. Symbol layer**

same logic here as on the numbers and some additional characters to avoid shifting. no home row mods here.

**3. Navigation layer**

my beloved layer with some undo, copy  paste, redo, cut options right next to the reversed T runner arrows.

on the left side some macro for alt tab between the two lately active windows for faster copy/cut paste between  folders or apps

have added alt+space combo on the top row of left to activate the menu of each window which then allows me with the press of m to move with arrow keys the current window a bit left or right without touching the mouse.

i have powertoys installed and i had to deactivate the alt+space combo for that app from there although it had a pretty descent search apps/files equivalent in that keyboard shortcut. i need to remap it to something else.

**4. Mouse layer**

used usually for short bursts by the long press activation of left thumbs inner key. super easy. got me a while to get the sensitivity i wanted.

when i want to move across screens i either use the accelerator buttons on top row of left side or use the binding on the top row rightest key that is a shortcut of a minimap provided by powertoys. right click with mouse 1 on my right thumb and boom i am three screens away.

i cannot stress how much scrolling i do by this layer on browser in jira and other pages or long documents in pdf etc. using the bottom row is super handy for me.

added left and right click on both sides to provide even single handed use with the left part if i pick up the coffee mug in the meantime.

for more accuracy i then use my trusted companion mx master 3 (sorry for neglecting you my friend lately)

i used to use TD(0) for click and drag in the window of capcut because for some weird reason it wasnt registering properly and i have it here as a legacy tap dance if it is needed later on.

**5. Multimedia layer**

some basic functions, earlier i had it included on another layer.

addition of some macros for toggling mic on/off accross windows or teams app. new teams has disappointed me lately and i keep pressing first the combo for getting focus to the teams app and then the combo to unmute. i will probably create a better macro for that to have both actions in it or just add the go to teams macro to the button next to M0 to mute mic again after speaking without sending an unneeded go to teams again before toggling back to mic mute.  --- if only there was a way to get to understand how my thinkpads button toggles mic accross the system and map that program to a button that would be a dream.

**6. Function layer**

the buttons are on the left side. 

F2, F4 are my most used ones especially on file explorer and excel, and then F11, F12 for browser and power query, vba on excel.

some print screen, scroll lock, pause just for having them assigned to a key if they are needed sometime. probably never, except scroll lock for excel...

**7. Minecraft layer**

this is activated by a three key combo of either top row top keys and deactivated with the pinky right.

usually i replace my right half with my mouse (pros of having a split keyboard like corne) and torture myself building something useless on minecraft. this is a work in progress and some keys that dont make sense like the bottom row are keys from the previous state of this layer which war repurposed for gaming and removing home row mods to be able to move with holding down keys of the home row a-s-d without needing to remap controls on other games for directional movement now that i have colemak for base layer. notice that asd is on key to the right if you think it in a qwerty way. i take advantage of the physical pyramid of the keys on the keyboard for that.

in the screenshot you can see details from vial.

hope you enjoyed it.

I just want to be over with amenhorreah, so I‚Äôm making some changes, and I want to know how if it‚Äôs enough to get my period back and if I should change anything.

1. Decreasing running. 
Normally I would run 3-5 days a week, and do about 15-25km total, but now Ive replaced my runs with strength training and walks, and now only will go for the occasional 2-4km slow jog to stretch my legs and clear my head, maybe 1-3 times a week. I‚Äôm not completely giving up running because when I got a period in June, I was still doing some slow runs, even up to 10km at a time, so I think doing some running wouldn‚Äôt be a problem.

2. Replacing morning coffee with black tea. 

3. Upping my antidepressant dosage.
I think I lost my period again partially due to anxiety, as I went through a period of time where I had very bad health anxiety, so I‚Äôm hoping the increased antidepressant dosage will help lower stress.

4. Gaining weight back to the weight I was in July, when I got my last period. Due to anxiety and IBS affecting my appetite I lost 2kg over August and September, which I already worked to gain back, and I‚Äôm now at the weight I was in July.

5. Eating at maintenance or above. Prioritising carbs and fats over protein. And moving away from keeping a count of the calories I‚Äôve eaten in my head.

6. Adding a tbsp of ground flax seeds to my breakfast, and trying to eat more tofu and soy milk.

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caff√® Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don‚Äôt like coffee and ¬£2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Steps:

* Download the Caff√® Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/JNe8xFjdvLb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caff√® Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the ‚Äúwallet‚Äù section then ‚Äúvouchers‚Äù. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

1geb1bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIGetTherapy/comments/1geb1bm/the_moment_i_realized_i_needed_therapy/,The Moment I Realized I Needed Therapy,"

I didn‚Äôt think I needed therapy. I‚Äôd always believed therapy was for others‚Äîpeople going through ‚Äúreal‚Äù challenges, not for someone like me, whose life looked fine from the outside. But the truth was, while everything might have seemed okay, I was carrying a weight that I couldn‚Äôt shake.

It started subtly. Small things would irritate me to an unusual degree, like spilling coffee or missing a bus. At first, I brushed it off as just ‚Äústress,‚Äù assuming it was temporary. But as the weeks went by, I found myself avoiding things I usually enjoyed. I started skipping events, making excuses to dodge friends, and even lost interest in my hobbies. It was like I was moving in slow motion while everyone around me lived life at full speed. I was exhausted but couldn‚Äôt find a way to rest.

One day, I remember sitting in my car, parked outside a friend‚Äôs birthday party, knowing I should go in and celebrate. But for some reason, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to step out. My mind was filled with this overwhelming sense of dread‚Äîan invisible wall I couldn‚Äôt cross. It was like I had all these unspoken thoughts and emotions locked up inside me, and they were slowly suffocating me. Sitting there alone, it hit me: I wasn‚Äôt okay, and I needed help.

The decision to go to therapy didn‚Äôt come easy. I spent days doubting myself, thinking maybe I was just overreacting. I kept telling myself I should just ‚Äúsnap out of it.‚Äù But the more I fought it, the heavier the weight became. Finally, I looked up a therapist in my area, just to see my options. Even then, I hesitated to make the call. The idea of opening up to a stranger felt intimidating. But I realized that staying where I was‚Äîstuck and overwhelmed‚Äîwas no longer an option.

So, I called. And to my surprise, that first step felt lighter than I expected. Just talking to someone who listened without judgment felt like a relief. In therapy, I found a space to understand myself better, to recognize the patterns in my thoughts, and to let go of the pressure to ‚Äúbe okay‚Äù all the time.

Looking back, the moment I realized I needed therapy was a turning point. It taught me that mental health isn‚Äôt something to ignore or power through. Sometimes, the best thing we can do is ask for help. Therapy didn‚Äôt erase my problems overnight, but it gave me tools to handle them in a healthier way.

To anyone out there feeling like they‚Äôre stuck in that same place, thinking therapy might not be for them‚ÄîI get it. But sometimes, the hardest part is just admitting that you need a little help. And that‚Äôs okay.

Feel free to share if you‚Äôve had a similar moment, or if you‚Äôre in that place now, unsure whether therapy is the right step. We‚Äôre here to support each other on this journey.",1,1730144207.0,ShouldIGetTherapy,0,1.0,False

I was always what people call a lazy and dirty person. I barely clean my room, my mom does all my laundry, I rarely take shower everyday, in short, I was disgusting. I was aware of all that and it was really hard for me to stand up and fix those issues. Then, I got into books a few months ago. I was hooked on politics but I wanted to try something else, literature. A lot of people recommended authors like Dostoevsky, Dazai, etc. to start. But what caught my attention was Camus' The Stranger. A friend of mine said that reading Camus makes his coffee taste better‚Äîespecially the ""ahh"" sound he moans after he takes a good good sip of coffee. And so I bought The Stranger, because my friend said that it was the easiest and most accessible one to read. After I finished it, the last few paragraphs got me thinking for 6 hours straight before finally finding out what it means. What I interpreted from the ending is that living is being free. Suddenly, the day after I finished it, my entire daily routine changed. I cleaned my entire room, rearranged my wardrobe, thrown away a lot of stuff and trash from my room, and more things that I can't imagine me doing. My life changed. For the first time since forever, I felt clean and diligent. Somehow, I'm so much happier. My appreciation for life drastically increased. My Mom actually said that God answered her prayers because I changed my routine. To this day I still don't know how I suddenly got the power to stand up and face my issues. It's like that book unlocked shackles in myself, even though I don't know what it freed. I just felt the feeling of being alive for the first time since eternities.

1geavjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1geavjf/i_love_this_girl_really/,I Love This Girl Really,"So. Long story short, there is a girl. At this point I knew her for the last 6 or 7 years, we've been friends and I never was interested in her romantically or in any way other than friendly till a year ago or so.

Long story short, she went to the same college I did but only for one semester, we nevertheless remained friends, me and a group of dudes. Basically, the group dissolved because apparently everyone fell for her and some weird stuff happened, I wasn't there so I'm not sure. This happened like 3 years ago.

So we remained friends, yada yada and over time we became closer. I got to know her better and over time I started to see her differently, you know? I started to appreciate her qualities as a person, somehow some of her values aligned with mine very much. So, I thought, actually we would've been great together, I mean we always spent excellent time with each other, I've never had so much fun with anybody else, she's very funny and laughs at all of my jokes, like honestly.

So again, cutting the story short, it wasn't like I developed a crush for her all of a sudden of course, at the time I was in the process of taking on new responsibilities in life, I was out of college, trying to find a job, trying to learn how to get a job, figure out what to do, I had to financially support my family at this point, which thank god I happened to be able to do... And in the midst of taking on new responsibilities in life, I learned of an idea that ""the opportunities are wherever the responsibility has been abdicated"" and I actively applied it in all parts of my life, I started regularly exercising, and taking on more responsibility at work (which paid off in a big way), I was able to focus more on my studies in further my education...

So... When I looked at my life, looking for ""abdicated responsibilities"" I saw my romantic life and specifically my relationship with this girl, it was like a direction I could go in but for some reason never did, like I never allowed myself to even think of her romantically, never, until this time in my life, where I seriously looked at it and tried to find things that I could do, that I probably should do but for some reason not doing.

And again, we had such a good time together, so one evening, after eating and talking for hours and laughing at each other's jokes, I just asked: does she want to go to \[this place\] with me? For the context, we didn't talk about \[this place\] during our dinner, or before, we didn't talk about anything related to it, and it's not a place that would just go into spontaneously, it's not a romantic place but it's fun. And she excitedly said: ""Yes! I also thought of that!"" and I was confused, like: ""really? interesting"" :D. For further context: before dinner we went to a pet shop and she looked for a specific type of animal, let's say, she wanted to acquire it later, this is important for later\*

So we decided to go next week, then we postponed and that week happened to be the week of her birthday, so I congratulated her on her birthday and a couple of days before we went, she asked if we could go to one other place as well (related to what she's interested in) and of course I said yes. 

So fastforward to her birthday, I got that ""animal"" she wanted to acquire, specifically the same one, I got a nice cake, we went to the first place, and that place, workers were really nice, but they obviously acted as in, like they know that I like her, not implicitly, but she's smart she'd understand it. 

Once we left that place she acted a bit weird as in, she talked about some boys messaging her lately etc. Nevertheless at the end of the day she asked if I wanted to go to a park with her to ride bikes there and of course I said yes, we agreed upon next week. It happened to be so late that the subway didn't work and she offered that her father would take me home and of course, I refused but she insisted and so he ended up taking me home.

During the week, however, she changed her mind citing bad weather and asked me to come up with something else and all I could come up with the day before was movie theatre. I offered to postpone but she refused.

So, we went to the movies and that day it was terrible, like it was obvious she didn't want to be there, I had a terrible time, I'm sure she did too, she was very closed to conversation and jokes and it was terrible, not like always.

In the end, I offered to meet again but she obviously didn't want to, I could see what was happening and basically I wanted to talk to her on the phone but she refused saying that she went to see her relatives in another town, so I understood what was up and just stopped texting her.

I know it's a long long story but bare with me. A year later (almost) she congratulated me on my birthday, then a couple of months later I congratulated her and well... I used some courage and asked if she wanted to go for a coffee to a place recently opened, it felt very natural, and she said that she'd love to but she's in a different city since she's in university (she's studying a uni in a different city, I know that), but that she'd love to go there with me when she comes back to our city and then asked my what I've been up to, so I told her about the MA, the promotion etc, she reacted positively, I asked about her, school etc. she responded... Then in the end I told her that if she wants to, when she comes back we could go for that coffee and she said yes, I'll text you once I'm back.

I know it's impossible to tell, but could she be interested? She doesn't have a boyfriend. Can I turn this into something great and long term? I would love to marry her someday, she's amazing.

(Spoiler, he‚Äôs reserved)","I have a male colleague that I secretly like, but I'm uncertain if he feels the same way. From the very first day we met, he seemed very cheerful, which might be because we share similar backgrounds in our company. He‚Äôs quite reserved, while I tend to be more outgoing. I‚Äôm the type of person who shares food at work and offers snacks to everyone, and that‚Äôs how we started talking. Before that, we would just wave and smile at each other in the office. I took the initiative to start conversations, but at first, it was very platonic since I was just being my friendly self.

Eventually, he began coming by my desk to ask if I had lunch or to invite me to lunch, but unfortunately, we never managed to go together. However, we did commit to having coffee, and it turned out to be amazing. I enjoyed his company, and he seemed to stare a lot. He answered my questions, which felt like a good sign, but it frustrated me that when I asked about his weekend, he wouldn‚Äôt reciprocate by asking about mine. Despite this, he continued to come over to chat and would often suggest having coffee later in the day. 

I‚Äôve noticed that he opens up to me, yet he doesn‚Äôt inquire about my personal life. It could be that he has boundaries he doesn‚Äôt want to cross, but it‚Äôs interesting that he answers my questions so freely. I like him and am interested, but I‚Äôm unsure if he feels the same way. His invitations for coffee could just be friendly gestures; however, I don‚Äôt see him doing this with others. I‚Äôm hesitant to read too much into it, but I hope he finds the courage to ask me out for coffee outside of work. 

In the meantime, I'm uncertain about his feelings. He is quite open, yet also very reserved. I know that my personality tends to encourage even the quietest people to chat. Perhaps his coffee invitations are innocent, but I feel like his body language and smiles suggest otherwise. My interactions with him feel very different compared to another male colleague, which might be because I like him. I usually wouldn‚Äôt entertain the idea of liking someone at work, but with him, it feels different. Maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it, and our frequent coffee or lunch invites are simply platonic because we get along well. What do you think?

I am currently split between three options:

1. ZP6 Special
- Wouldn‚Äôt be able to use my picopresso when traveling, but would also allow me to brew some super high clarity v60s.

2. K-ultra
- essentially a hand-crank version of the Lagom from my understanding, expensive, but could do espresso and aeropress

3. Q
- lighter, smaller, cheaper, and might be able to be used with my picopresso

so, yesterday, i messaged my father after after a huge fight with my mom. i asked for his side of the story and today nagcall kami.

so, basically, ang nangyari pala is, my mom is the one who cheated with several guys kapag nasa abroad papa ko nagwwork. then while they were still together, she worked as a prostitutes or something, basta binabayaran for sex. and she would always talk to my papa abt the guys na they're really good in bed ganon.

si mama ko raw is drug addict na even before they met, and papa ko is the reason bakit nagstop kasi ayaw nya talaga sa ganon. then nung naanak na ako, complicated na rs nila kasi always naglalayas mama ko to meet up with other guys or to do drugs. every time naglalayas siya, binibigyan sya ng papa ko ng money kapag hinihingi niya. 

yung mama ko rin daw is hate na hate ako bata palang ako (this is true up until now), she would always say na ayaw nya sakin kasi pangit ako (maganda ako mga ses), annoying, sinira ko buhay nya. hindi raw nagluluto mama ko ng food sa bahay, rice lang daw tsaka nag iinit ng tubig for coffee, tapos yung papa ko always nagsisikap para magluto ng food. palagi raw ako umiiyak non kasi di ako pinapakain ni mama and siya raw is nagluto ng patatas for me kasi di siya marunong magluto ng rice, eh ayaw ko daw sa patatas so lagi siya humihingi sa kapit bahay ng rice. 

super tamad daw talaga mama ko, di naglalaba, di nagluluto, lahat. ang tawag nga raw sa papa ko noon is ""the battered husband"" kasi mama ko is palaging nagagalit ganon. every time raw maghihiwalay sila, tinithreaten siya ng mama ko about something, i forgot what basta ganon tapos always nanghihingi ng pera.

after nila maghiwalay, naglayas mama ko tapos dinala ako para daw may makuha siyang pera from my dad. nagbibigay ng pera papa ko, tapos di niya ako nakikita. nag file ng case mama ko against him, tapos nagtalk sila ng lawyer something about it sila ni mama na iddrop nya yung case if babayaran nya si mama 150k pesos. nag agree papa ko kasi foreigner siya, wala siya laban dito sa pinas. pagdating nung araw ng bayaran, hindi siya pumirma na iddrop niya yung case at gusto nya ng mas malaki pang pera, so ibinigay ata ni papa ko and hindi na talaga kami nagkita ever since.

after a few years or months ata, nakapag agree sila na magbibigay si papa ko ng sustento for me. nung mga time na yun is wala na siya work, pension nalang, tapos super liit yung pension kasi something about hindi nabayaran sss because of my mom. so papa ko is sabi na 50 euros lang kaya nya ibigay sakin na sustento, and sabi ni mama ko na, kainin mo yang pera mo, kulang na kulang yan sa make up ko palang. 

additional info lang, alam ng papa ko san kami nakatira ng whole fam ko, pero he didn't dare na pumunta sa lugar namin kasi natatakot siyang patayin ng family ko because may nangyari nang similar sa past sa ibang fam member. he said super willing daw siya kunin ako from my mom everytime sinasabi ng mom ko na kunin na ko kasi she hates me, etc. willing din siya mameet ako ket sometimes lang basta wag lang daw sa lugar namin (sa isla kami nakatira).


so yeah, madami pa siya nakwento kasi i forgot na and kapagod na mag type. so, abyg kasi cinontact ko papa ko and sinuway mama ko? and because mas naniniwala ako sa papa ko kasi halos lahat ng sinasabi niya is tugmang tugma sa na eexperience ko sa mother ko? and should i trust the words of my father na hindi ko na kilala?",2,1730141243.0,PanganaySupportGroup,0,1.0,False

So I responded to an OA ad and we were chatting for 2 maybe 3 days. I responded to the ad because I basically aligned with everything she wanted. She wanted something pretty emotional and she had a ""bonus if your close to here"" and sure enough I was close to there. 

We do the pic exchange everything going well, we continue talking and the conversation was moving good, flowing pretty naturally, so we moved to telegram, turns out she said ""bonus if your close to location"" is because she travels there frequently  and turns out after further discussion I work maybe 10 minutes away. So everything going well. 

Anyway... so things got a bit spicy as she said she was having a trip come up right before Thanksgiving and I said if we're still continuing to get along and vibe well i'd be happy to meet for dinner after work. 

Apparently that wasn't the correct answer, she was saying how dinner would be a waste of time and we both know it and to get a hotel. I politely declined meeting a hotel right away and said if you weren't comfortable for a long dinner since your office is 10 mins from mine maybe we can get coffee on our lunch breaks. 

Again not the correct answer apparently, saying how it would be just a waste of time because she'd have a hotel room booked with no one else in it. 

I said well maybe I will consider it but I really want both of us to be comfortable and feel safe. She immediately went on another tangent.

I would like to say I was being catfished but we did do a video call, so I knew who I was talking to. But that behavior made me litterly say Hell No and I just blocked her....  ",11,1730141026.0,adultery,22,0.76,False

1ge9npp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ge9npp/one_year_later/,One year later,"Hey mom, one year ago today you started to transition. You knew it was time, after 9.5 years of a downhill battle with ALS (Lou Gherigs Disease). Your nurse Tina came that morning and told me what was happening as you drifted in and out of consciousness, warm and safe in your bed at home. You told me that's how you wanted to go. 

When you finally had a lucid moment you asked me if you were dying. When I said yes you smiled peacefully at me and said ""Oh finally, can I have a smoke?"" I could only laugh as I lit one up for you. I wasn't about to deny you anything at this point. 

For the next week you drifted in and out of consciousness, saying your goodbye to your family. It felt like everyone came to give you a hug, tell you they loved you, and say their goodbyes. We never left you alone. It was always me or your sister sitting there. 

Early on the morning of November the 4th you had your last moment of clarity. By then you had lost the ability to speak at all. I could tell by your eyes that something was happening. I tried to understand what you were saying but couldn't make out the words, you looked distressed so I just went with what I think I would have said in your position. I told you I loved you too, that your kids and family are going to be ok. Your grandchildren are asleep in their beds. I asked if you saw them, the family that was waiting for you on the other side. Your eyes lit up, you smiled the best you could and I knew then that's exactly what you wanted to tell me. 

I told you it's ok, they are here to help you, I'm here for you. Don't hold on, we're all going to be ok. I gave you some medication, tucked you in, kissed you on the forehead, told you that I loved you so so much. Once the meds started to kick in I told you I was going to take a nap and would get you more meds when I woke up. I fell asleep in the recliner by your bed. 

When I woke up you looked like you were still sleeping comfortably. I got up and took care of my needs, made some coffee, got your meds. You didn't wake up though, you were gone. You passed exactly how you wanted to, at home, quietly, nobody fussing over you, all of your kids sleeping peacefully in bed. 

I wanted to cry but I laughed instead. Happy tears that you were finally at peace, even when my soul was falling apart. I called my aunt who called the rest of the family, I called my brothers. Then I put on Pink Floyd's Dark side of the moon on your record player, and left your room. 

The rest of the day was a blur, the nurses came to confirm your passing, Jen came over to just sit with me while I waited. My husband came by to hold me for a bit. I didn't want our son to be there for long so he took him home. 

I didn't break down again until the funeral home came to take you away. What a weird feeling that was. 

I miss you so much mom, I miss you calling me sweetie,  I miss your laugh, I miss you irritating me. 

On Monday I am going to spread the final bit of ashes I have left of you. As promised I didn't put them in anything that could end up at Goodwill. Most of them are on the trails of your favorite state park with both of your dogs. These I'm going to take to the nesting place of the Bald Eagles that come down every winter. You loved watching them so much. We used to sit down there and watch them for hours.

1ge9nfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ge9nfi/my_22f_boyfriend_24m_gets_extremely_anxious_every/,My (22F) boyfriend (24M) gets extremely anxious every time I try to bring up something he did that upset me. How can I address this issue with him without being insensitive?,"TLDR: I keep having to comfort my boyfriend after telling him that he hurt my feelings/upset me, and it's really starting to bother me, but I'm not sure how to address it with him.

Some background: Me and my boyfriend have been together for 7 months, and except for a couple of these instances our relationship has been incredible so far. My boyfriend does have a lot of anxiety in general and it's been especially bad the last few weeks because he's been working through some grief and experiencing heightened anxiety because of it. This instance is the most extreme example of this, previously he's gotten a little anxious but it doesn't end up being as much of an issue.

The situation: My boyfriend was staying over at my place for the weekend, and when we woke up together one morning he was kind of being a dick to me. He offered to make us breakfast, but the food he wanted to have for breakfast had gone bad and he was very disappointed (kind of pouting about it, annoyed at me for ""not storing it correctly,"" not wanting anything else to eat), so I ended up getting out of bed and making us both coffee to make him feel better. Later when we were drinking our coffee in bed, he was reading a book, so I asked him to pass me my phone to look at while I drank my coffee, and he made a snide remark about me being an iPad kid for wanting my phone while he read his book. Basically in general he was being kinda mean (and this is all pretty out of character for him). His mood continued through lunch where he wasn't very interested in talking and largely just sat quietly while we ate.

I wasn't sure if I was justifiably annoyed or just hangry at the time, so I waited to bring it up until after lunch, when I told him he was ""pretty grouchy"" that morning and that it bothered me when he called me an iPad kid for checking instagram while he was reading and ignoring me (I tried not to be overly harsh, but at one point I did say ""What the fuck was I supposed to do? Stare at the wall?""). He apologized and said he wouldn't say that again, I told him it was ok and not that big of a deal, and I thought that was that.

Right after that conversation we had a social event to go to, and he seemed ok if a little low energy there. As soon as we left the event he got teary and told me he was feeling really down and anxious. When we got home I comforted him and he told me he was just feeling overwhelmed from all of the things going on for him (dealing with his own grief, heavy discussion topics at the social event, stress). He mentioned that he was feeling especially anxious because he has a lot of fear around other people's love being conditional, and I guessed that this was triggered by me expressing my annoyance with him earlier, and he confirmed that it was.

I ended up comforting him and reassuring him the rest of the evening, and we even watched some of his favorite comfort show (instead of what we were planning on watching, one of my favorite shows that I wanted to show him). By the time we went to bed I was feeling really overlooked, and I felt like I couldn't even tell him that I felt that way because it would trigger another bout of anxiety and he wouldn't be able to sleep (he had work the next morning). I've been trying really hard to be accommodating to him the last few weeks and I've been really conscious and considerate of his feelings while he's going through this rough patch, and I just really wanted him to think about making me feel better after being mean all morning, but instead I once again was thinking about his feelings and had to ignore mine in the process.

To compound the issue, after he finished his shift at work the next day he texted me to tell me that something I said during the social event the previous day had upset him (it was pretty minor but very fair for it to have bothered him, I apologized and that situation has been resolved). The reason this is bothering me is because I told him that I had a lot of work to do that day and had to buckle down and get it done, but he still decided to text me about that despite knowing that I was extremely busy. Whereas I decided to keep it to myself when something was bothering me but I knew he had to work the following day.

All in all I feel like my feelings and needs are getting ignored in favor of his feelings and needs, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I know I need to address this with him eventually, but I'm not sure how or when. The situation is honestly really upsetting me, and I'm pretty angry about it and don't want to just sit on it, but he's going through a lot right now and I'm not sure if adding this to his plate would be the right call.",1,1730140817.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Till now i had a Graef CM702 but after 5 years, it's time to update that grinder.  
I am drinking espresso only, and my machine makes not more than two coffees per day.  
After my research, i am thinking to pull the trigger for the df54. The only issue is that in case of faulty parts it would be difficult to find replacements.  
There is not a big difference in cost on those grinders. Df54 costs 300$, Baratza ESP 225$ and Eureka Zero 330$  
I would love to move to Baratza or Eureka, as those names are many years in production and finding a replace part would be easier in future, but i love the low retention of the df54.  
I don't know if the Baratza ESP with an air blower-hopper on top, could be possible to have the same retention results like the df54, but if someone owns it, i would like to hear an opinion

So i would appreciate any suggestions between those three grinders, or even another, in that price range 200$-300$

This might be a shot in the dark, but here it goes: 
I‚Äôm looking for a caf√©/caf√©-like establishment somewhere near the Seattle Convention Center to serve a prepared light breakfast spread (think pastries, coffee, and bagels) for a group of 10-15 people. These people are all attending a conference at the convention center and won‚Äôt have much time to eat, let alone order, which is why I‚Äôm hoping that there is somewhere that can provide this food/drink already prepared. Bonus points if you can suggest a place that also has a private meeting space.

I tried to book this event through the convention center, but they are proposing to charge close to $1000 (including service charge and taxes). I know Seattle is expensive but come on! This seems like an excessive price for each of my attendees to eat a pastry and have a cup of coffee‚Ä¶

The hotel where I‚Äôm staying (not connected to the convention center) has told me that they can also accommodate the request, but they would similarly charge around $800 for the event.

I have no idea if what I am looking for exists in Seattle, especially since I‚Äôm limited to the area around the convention center. My guess is that there aren‚Äôt many places of this kind in this part of the city, and that is precisely why the convention center can charge so much.

1ge9ko6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ge9ko6/four_minutes_to_get_to_fremont_lake/,Four minutes to get to Fremont Lake,"Dear ----- hope you and your family are well. It was great to email with you last year, even though it was occasioned by me finding out your parents had passed away. I am still so sorry about that and we remember to pray for them every night.

I should be clear that I love my wife and children more than I could express.  I am sure you love your husband and your children in the same way. Several years ago memories of our friendship started to be present to me again. I looked at them with older and wiser eyes, and I wish that I could ask you and tell you some things.

Do you remember the last summer we worked together as college students? I want to let you know that summer is one of the most beautiful memories of my youth, and it is beautiful because of you.

That was the summer when, after knowing you not as well as I would have liked in high school and those first two summers home from college, I finally had to chance to talk to you as I always wanted to. That was the summer when I found every chance I could to talk to you, and I feel you did the same. While I always had special feelings for you, that was the summer I fully realized how truly wonderful you were. My feelings for you were so intense during those six weeks I could not sleep well and whenever I would arrive at work I would feel sick to my stomach in nervous anticipation of talking to you. Your presence to me intoxicated me in a way that left me dazed and not even able to begin to conceive how to tell you or ask you out.

I wonder if you remember the last week working together that summer? On Tuesday that week, we had been sitting and talking for a long time together--which we probably shouldn't have been--when you noticed the assistant director looking at us, obviously not happy and disapproving. You were embarrassed because you knew how it looked, and so you quickly got up and went to her to ask her what she needed. I was so happy being with you in that moment that I felt no awkwardness or embarrassment. But even so an hour later, after lunch, you came rushing over to me and said: ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off...Susan looked at me."" You needlessly apologized in an endearing way I never forgot, and then you picked up our conversation where we had left it.  And this was classic you, by the way. When other people the same age would be shallow and self-centered, you were always sensitive to others and caring, while also being so down to earth and responsible. Years later I realized in that moment you were most likely trying to show me you felt the same way I did. I'm sorry I couldn't allow myself to believe that at the time.   You were just so wonderful I could not wrap my head around the notion you might feel the same way. I'm sorry I didn't realize what that situation was, that we both shared feelings for one another but were waiting for the other person to make the first move.

Do you remember the last day of work that summer? It was Friday, August 4. It was a stunningly beautiful day, and near the end of the day we were standing together in the lake by ourselves talking. You were telling me about the dorms at your college, and I was telling you about the winter dance at mine. You were wearing a green Calvin Klein t-shirt and blue shorts. I often think back to that moment, because I realized much later how easily I could have asked you out then, and you almost certainly would have said yes. That was the moment it would have been so easy to open up to you, and that has become the ultimate road not taken of my life. It's astonishing for me to think if I had just spoken some more, different words to you that afternoon, words most in the same position wouldn't have had a problem saying, our lives might have been different. Not better, but quite possibly much different. I've wondered what those last three weeks might have been like before we went back to school. Would you have helped ease the logistics of dating I always found so awkward? I think you would have. Would we have agreed to drive the hour and 20 minutes between our colleges to see each other when we went back to school? I certainly would have. Ultimately I couldn't bring myself to say to you what I wanted to that day, and the best I could do was to ask for your email address and decide to write to you in the fall. I'm not sure why I thought that was a good idea, to wait 6 weeks to get in touch with you again, it clearly made no sense. But in any case, at the end of that day, you got into your car at 4:26pm and said"" Well...I have four minutes to get to Fremont Lake,"" to your other summer job. Then I watched you drive away, and I knew the summer I had treasured so much with you was over, and I mourned that deeply.

You remember, I'm sure, that I did write to you in September of that year after we had gone back to school. I had convinced myself to some degree that I would ask you out at Thanksgiving when we were both home from college. You made me so happy when you responded because it seemed to me like we were able to continue where we had left off in August. But then, after a few weeks of correspondence, you stopped writing back in October. I was sad and disappointed when that happened, and for some time I didn't understand why.  I now know the reason you stopped writing me was almost certainly because you had met and started dating someone who also happened to be your future husband, and who arrived at your school as a freshman that fall. You had met him only a few weeks after I had squandered our chance to be together. Unlike me, he was able to say the words to you I didn't have the courage to. I would think by that point you were probably tired of waiting for me as well. A year later, when I next heard from you, you made it clear right away you were dating someone.

You wouldn't know this, but after you stopped writing to me the rest of that year was not a good time for me. Later that year I got to know and developed feelings for another person. She had dated one of my best friends but he had broken it off a year earlier. I got to know her well, it was manifestly clear to me she was still obsessed with my friend in a way that wasn't healthy at all. This was a real agony for me, and later that winter I told her how I felt, and she responded by articulating her continued feelings for my friend, which wasn't a surprise to me. You can imagine that the next few months were filled with a lot of bitter feelings and heartache. I have asked myself so many times why I chose to open up to her but not to you six months earlier. She was, looking back on it now, different from you in so many ways that were not good and basically not the kind and incredibly decent person you were. This is the real regret I have about not telling you how I felt that summer. You were the one I should have made myself vulnerable to that year, and I really believe you could have saved me from the turmoil I experienced.

For many years I asked myself why I wasn't able to be honest with you about my feelings that summer, when we were standing in that lake together that afternoon. I do know I wasn't mature enough to see you probably returned my feelings, and I was also not mature enough to let myself be vulnerable to you. I also know I did not want to risk the friendship that we already had for the chance of something more. But, I try to be a person of faith, and so I don't believe your children or mine are random accidents. It's clear to me we were meant for other people from the beginning, and that for me is the most valid reason why I didn't. I like to think that we were each a foreshadowing of our spouses for one another, if that makes sense to you.

You'll remember that our summer job did not return due to budget cuts. And the next and last two times I saw you, a year after that summer when we met for coffee and two years after that when we met for lunch, I felt it was not the same. You were dating, and so I think that we could not be the same with each other once the possibility of being together was gone. We'd have to pretend now that we never had feelings for one another. It's ironic that one reason I didn't tell you how I felt was that I didn't want to risk losing the friendship we already shared, but in the end that friendship becomes less ""exciting"" and so in a sense you lose it anyway. You wouldn't marry him for several years (a year after I got married, I think), but I assume you were dating him pretty seriously at the time and you knew where it would go eventually. Is it significant that we both only dated one person seriously and ended up marrying them? It is for me.

Four years after that summer I heard your brother had passed away suddenly and I was shocked that we would have to share the pain of losing a sibling since I had lost my sister some years previously.  I remember I wrote you a condolence letter and said I had wanted to come see you at Thanksgiving. It seems like you were touched by what I wrote because you responded to me saying that of all the words of comfort anyone had offered you, nothing was more beautiful than what I had written. Sometimes I wonder if you still have that card I sent you?

You know I did not come to see you that year at Thanksgiving when I was visiting my parents, and I'm sorry about that. Not long after I wrote to you I met my wife, and even though by Thanksgiving we had only been dating for six weeks it was clear to me even then that she would be the one I would spend the rest of my life with. Because of that, it felt too awkward to try to see you. The memories of what I had felt, what I believe we both had once felt but always remained unsaid, were still too recent for me. Honestly, they probably still are now. And that is why I'm still hesitant to see you today, even though last year you told me you would love to see me and my family next time we are in the area.

I do want to make sure you know the memories of you and that summer are not something I hold close to me because of any unhappiness in my marriage or family or life in general, because there is none. In some less detailed fashion, I have told my wife about these thoughts and she has been understanding while at the same time teasing me to a degree. She does remind me a lot of you and I think you would have been good friends if you had known each other. It's more the case that you personify for me a happy time before the real concerns of life weigh you down. A time when you're somewhat an independent adult but not quite. The comfort of your childhood is not so remote to you yet, while at the same time so many possibilities and exciting things lie just ahead of you. It's also not hard to think that the world was maybe not as dark a place back then as it is now. You and that summer are who and what I identify most with that special time. Even though what we shared didn't flower into something both of us might have wanted, it was still so meaningful for me. 

It's ok. It can be at times unsettling to think there is another person you might have had a potential alternate life with had you just been able to say some words to them one particular day, and that is a sort of crisis of you I need to deal with. I am so happy though there was never anything truly negative in our friendship, and am glad that we now exchange Christmas cards. I am even more glad to know you are still the beautiful person you were all those years ago. I want you to know that often when something greatly depresses me or worries me, one memory that gives me joy is remembering the last day of the beautiful summer. And I remember us standing together in that lake, so much of our lives still ahead of us, though God willed them to be with other people.

1ge9fpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ge9fpt/my_best_friend_is_a_serial_love_bomber_how_should/,"My best friend is a serial love bomber, how should I proceed? ","I met J three years ago (both in our mid twenties, jobless at the time) doing some yoga in the park. We had a lot of shared interests and hit it off really well. 

At the time that I met her, she was going through a rough patch; she was in the middle of moving, dealing with some toxic friendships, and struggling with her family life. I felt a big degree of pity for her and tried to help her where I could, but ultimately these things consumed most of her energy and we didn‚Äôt see each other for several months. 

Around my birthday, I invited her to my birthday party. We caught up after the long months and had a good time. The week after, we arranged to grab coffee and have a deeper catch up sesh. 

Over coffee, J proceeded to tell me about several friends who had ‚Äúdropped her‚Äù from their lives and completely cut her off. Again, I felt bad for her and tried to offer as much sympathy as I could. She was very appreciative and sweet about it, suggesting that we hang out more often again. 

For nearly a year on from this point, she would plan something with me 1-3 times a week. This was a lot for me, but I also loved having a friend who wanted to devote so much time to me. 

However, over the course of that year, she continued to develop other friends who would ‚Äúdrop her‚Äù after a few months. At this point, I had heard a similar story of one of her strong friendships going completely south maybe 5-6 times. I was beginning to worry about our own relationship, even though I still thought she was the sweetest, funniest person. 

Everything changed for me around March of this year. I met another girl, L, who I became good friends with. L and J hit it off well when I introduced them to each other, thus creating a pretty good friend group between the 3 of us. 

However, over the course of a couple months, J stopped texting me, wouldn‚Äôt respond to my texts, nor wouldn‚Äôt like or comment any of my social media posts. But at least a couple of times a week, I would see her posting pictures doing things with L. 

I decided to take a step back from this friendship because I finally understood the pattern of love bombing that would begin with her getting overly attached to a friend just to end contact with them (likely resulting in past friends cutting her off). But I wanted to be the bigger person and not make any big deal of it, especially because I still have a good friendship with L too. 

Nowadays, I only see J if L plans a group activity. J will act personable and interested as she did once before, but if I try to text her or contact her when L isn‚Äôt around, she won‚Äôt respond to me. It seems like an act for L at times. 

I would like to invite her to talk about my feelings toward the situation before ending this friendship, but it would be impossible to plan without a response from her. I also don‚Äôt want to call her out on it in front of L/publicly. 

Should I just avoid contact with her as her past friends have? Should I just text/call her with my feelings laid out? Should I express these concerns to L first? 

I don‚Äôt want to cause unnecessary drama but this friendship is beginning to feel calculated and cold and not worth my time.

1ge9exi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ge9exi/went_a_little_crazy_on_my_husband_about_a_new/,Went a little crazy on my husband about a new young girl at work (a decade younger than me),"My (28) husband's (27) boss (33) took this girl (18) on from a different part of the company and now spends most of his time with her at work. He also just hired another young girl (18 or 19) off of Indeed for a different position. It's not super normal to have young girls working there because it's a car shop, but they can do what is being asked and the position is not high labor, so it works out (except I just get weird vibes about this boss being a creep).

  
Anyways this is about my husband. So I start hearing more than normal about this new, young girl. More so than he has ever talked about anyone else at work. This alone didn't bother me as first.. but then came some other information my gut just didn't feel right. One day he up and told me that she was buying him coffee a lot, multiple times a week. I think he told me because it was bothering him, and he also told me he said to her ""What do you have a crush on me or something"" and told her to save her money. Which I respect him for and for telling me. However, it's strange to me how he told me that she got a ""white girl tattoo like you"" and said that she showed him a picture of it while at work (it's on her ribcage). I honestly started to feel unsure.

I honestly have not felt jealous in a LONG time. We have been together for 7 years and have never had any doubts and our relationship is STRONG. What we have built is sacred and we both know that. However, I am hung up on this girl and ended up telling him that I was uncomfortable about the entire thing and that it was upsetting that there was all this appeal for a new, young girl in the shop and that he was bringing her up a lot more than normal. He let me know he understood why it would seem that way and that didn't view her that way. He said it was a new face and that's why. But I said that it normally is not like that with a new old lady or man. He seemed to understand why I was bothered. He said that he would never give our life up for someone else, especially a young girl. I struggle a lot with being stuck on things (maybe because of my OCD), so once I got it off my chest and he reassured me that there is absolutely nothing there, I kind of couldn't let it go fully. I don't feel good about how I most recently brought it up and feel like the very OLD toxic side of me came out, and I just feel gross about myself. I was upset that she showed him her tattoo and that they're close enough for that to be a thing.

This is a shop full of old men. He is the youngest guy there and is the boss. Young girls just have never been something they've had until now that his new boss hired her.

He has never cheated on me. I don't know how to let this go and stop thinking like a toxic crazy person because I genuinely feel bad and gross. I think I just have an idea in my head of her, but I don't even know her and don't know her intentions. I don't like the idea of how close it seems they may have gotten before I learned more about it. The coffee buying, the showing of the tattoo, the fact that he talked about her a lot, it just bothers me and I am not usually jealous so I wish I knew how to stop. I am afraid my husband will be unattracted to me because I am a gross, jealous wife, and who wants that? Yuck.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can let it go fully and be a better wife? 

  
TLDR; The new young girl hired at my husband's work makes me feel jealous and I want to know how to let it go even though it doesn't feel right",17,1730140239.0,relationships,34,0.73,False

I (f20) live at home with my parents and my brother (m24). 

This will be a long story so I want to thank everyone who reads it all. 

Backstory: 
My brother and I had a pretty good relationship when we were younger but as we grew older things changed.
He is a ‚Äúgifted‚Äù child and wasn‚Äôt really trying to ‚Äúhide it‚Äù. 
This annoyed me because he never let a chance slide to mention that he is the smartest in the family. 
My parents never really bothered to do anything about that and spoiled him a lot. 
By spoiling I mean this men is 24 years old and my mother and father cook for him and bring him his plate to his room when he is ready to eat. 
They spoiled me too but I know how to cook for myself, clean my room, use a goddamn dishwasher and things like that.
When he turned 18 he got his first gf. His gf had a looot of psychological problems and my brother always had a hero syndrome.
She had her own flat but lived far away and therefore the two of them lived with us for 4 months. 
Those 4 months were literal HELL. 
My brother isn‚Äôt a very clean person and his gf was neither. They didn‚Äôt clean, cook, contribute financially or helped around the house. 
After a fight with my father about this the two of them finally moved out. 
My parents organised the moving, bought furnitures for their house and did a looot for the two of them. 
May parents are those kind of in-laws everybody wishes for themselves. 
My brother gf never appreciated any of this, one example: my brother and mother went on a 1 week long vacation one time, during that time my brother had some health issues and had to got the hospital as soon as they came back, where he had to stay for 1 more week. This was during COVID which meant only one person could visit him per day, he chose my mother because she could cook his fav food for him, wash him, had flexible working times and could spoil him more(this was completely his decision) when his gf found out she looked at my mother and told her ‚Äúthank you for taking MY men another week away from me‚Äù after my brother was released she threw all the dirty dishes and clothes my brother used during the hospital visit and everything else this women took from my mother over the last 3 years in a bag pack and gave them back to us. 
However after 4 years they finally separated and he came back living with us.
It‚Äôs been one year since then and now to the main story: 

About two weeks ago I was laying in my bed when I suddenly heard my father knocking on my brother‚Äôs door and asking him to speak with him, my brother declined. I went outside to see what happened and by the look in my father‚Äôs eyes I knew something was wrong. 
I went to my mother and she showed me a text message from my brother to her where he basically said that he can‚Äôt live in this house anymore, that he is getting bullied and my parents are a part of the bullying and that he won‚Äôt come to an upcoming trip with us anymore. 
My mother went and ‚Äúforced‚Äù him to talk to her because this came out of the blue. 
Mine and my brothers room are next to each other therefore I can hear a lot through the walls, especially if someone is screaming. 
Well to keep it short: my brother was screaming that I am the devil, that I am bullying him, that I‚Äôm manipulative, my parents can‚Äôt control me anymore and that he had the right to beat the shit out of me for how I‚Äôm acting but he won‚Äôt do it because he has such a good heart. 
I was SCARED. 
My brother is 6‚Äô4 and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1. 
I called a friend of mine and she came and picked me up. 
After 2 hours of her calming me down I decided to go back home and go straight to bed. 
But before I could do that my mother came out of my brothers room and told me he wanted to talk to me, I said I don‚Äôt want to as I was not in the right mind for a talk with him. However she pressured me and so I gave in. 
We talked for about 40 minutes and he switched up stories and situations from a whole year that made me look like a complete asshole. When I didn‚Äôt give in and said that isn‚Äôt what happened or that‚Äôs not how that went he blew up and ended the conversation by telling me he is no longer my brother, doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with me and to never speak to him again. 
The next day I woke up and saw a handwritten letter from him, in this letter he apologised and wrote that he loved me, that I will always be his sister and he will always be my brother. 
Since then I haven‚Äôt spoken to him but my parents acted as if that solved very thing and everything should go back to normal now. 

(for those of you asking themselves why he blew up like that: because a few days before that, he asked if his long distance  gf could sleep here and I said no because tbh I am very uncomfortable around her and he convinced himself that I said no because I am evil and want him to be miserable)

This morning my brother woke up and asked my mother if we had coffee and that he is going to make himself one, he does this because he knows then my mother will do it for him.
 So when my mother jumped up and wanted to make his coffee I told her to let him make it himself. 
About 2 hours ago she came to me and told me to not say those kind of things around my brother because he may hear it. 
I blew up and I am not very proud of that but I asked how she could care so much about him hearing something like that when she didn‚Äôt give a damn about all the things he said to me two weeks ago. She started crying and screaming back at me saying she doesn‚Äôt understand what I want her to do now. I don‚Äôt know but I feel bad now because I never make my mother cry.

Baratza ESP vs DF54 vs Eureka zero ,"A week now reading non stop to decide which grinder to match with my Gaggia Classic (9bar mod). Till now i had a Graef CM702 but after 5 years, it's time to update that grinder.  
I am drinking espresso only, and my machine makes not more than two coffees per day.  
After my research, i am thinking to pull the trigger for the df54. The only issue is that in case of faulty parts it would be difficult to find replacements.  
There is not a big difference in cost on those grinders. Df54 costs 300$, Baratza ESP 225$ and Eureka Zero 330$  
I would love to move to Baratza or Eureka, as those names are many years in production and finding a replace part would be easier in future, but i love the low retention of the df54.  
I don't know if the Baratza ESP with an air blower-hopper on top, could be possible to have the same retention results like the df54, but if someone owns it, i would like to hear an opinion  


So i would appreciate any suggestions between those three grinders, or even another, in that price range 200$-300$

[USA],"We stayed at a lovely AirBnb over this last weekend, and they were pet friendly.  Days prior to checking in, I informed the host of the dogs we were bringing.  (One Basset/Husky mix 9 yo and a 9 month Golden Retriever).  I was told it would be fine.  Bassets and Huskies are known shedders and our 9 month old Golden sheds a little right now.  He's young, so more to come.  Anyhoo, we cleaned up after ourselves, cleaned up water spots around sink, I brought my own towels to use, and only two of our party of 4 used one bath towel each.  I used a lint brush on spots where the dogs rubbed up on, we put all trash in a bag, and left the place as it was when we arrived, minus the freshly made beds.  We were quiet during quiet hours. We had one request while there and that was for 4 more coffee pods for our next morning there.  I didn't feel comfortable asking, but our friends convinced me to ask, they said it wouldn't be asking too much, so I did.  The request was kindly granted with a ""we can't have you de-caffeinated"" There was no kitchen, but there was a stocked drink fridge, a microwave and a Nespresso machine.

Maybe I'm being too sensitive, but I feel like the review he left for me was a bit lack luster.  If you are pet-friendly, there is going to be fur from most dog breeds.  We don't do hybrid dogs that can be bred for anti-shedding.  The review the host left read:   Everything was fine except the excessive amount of dog hair, I think they left half the dogs here"" with a laughing emoji.  I'm thinking this will really put a damper on my future rental capabilities.  We don't always travel with our dogs, FYI, but even-so.  I mean, we took care of a lot of the maid's duties.  I used to do housekeeping years ago, in Aspen, so I know what's expected... I made sure anything gross (napkins kleenex eating utensils plates, etc) were all placed in a trash bag and ready for the outside trash can.  We took our pooh bags with us to the dog park and got rid of them.  Yes - there was dog fur on the floor of the suite.  Excessive? No.  If there had been a broom I would have swept it up though, and I kindly responded with that comment. That's just me.  I semi-clean our hotel rooms before checking out...

I just feel like their review wasn't about us being quiet guests, or guests they'd welcome back, but more of a warning to future airbnb hosts of us.  Thoughts? Help me see this as a positive... I'm not bashing, I am literally feeling bad.  It woke me up in the night last night.

EDIT:  I'm considering sending the hosts an extra $50 for the ""excessive fur"".",1,1730140002.0,AirBnB,5,0.6,False

my bf recently let one of his good friends move into his house, we both live separately (kinda) i have my own place so i can reset and we both think it‚Äôs a healthy dynamic since we both just barely started dating this year. we made his house our main living space and i‚Äôve only slept at my place 2 weeks out of 7 months so this is our home. i buy groceries, i cook, clean, decorate, etc. knowing their past i was a little reluctant to be alright with it but she‚Äôs nice to me so i thought it would be okay. 

they used to date the same girl at the same time so like a throuple. they said they never did anything together just with her but at this point the less i know the better because it already is weird to me. the first couple of days she moved in were nice, was cool, we shared coffee and conversations in the morning but then one day she asked my boyfriend if he could tell me to ‚Äúgo home‚Äù so she ‚Äúcould have the house to herself for homework and to study.‚Äù we have a 5 bedroom house so i see no problem taking space somewhere in the house for homework or even her room but the fact she didn‚Äôt ask me or tell me she was going to need time by herself to study when she sits and talks about everything under the sun with me, every single morning in the kitchen and told my boyfriend that i needed to not be at the house at a certain time really rubbed me the wrong way. 

i‚Äôve expressed that and i‚Äôve been told im coming off as jealous but im just so uncomfortable an she told me i have no right to be upset because i technically don‚Äôt live in the home and im a ‚Äúguest‚Äù on the basis of me not paying rent but buying literally everything else from food to laundry detergent like my bf and i agreed and even him calling it my home. so that pissed me off even more and i told her absolutely not; this was my safe space to begin with, that you were invited into. 

things are awkward now and i‚Äôve noticed she gets upset when she isn‚Äôt invited to do things with us and the energy she brings when him and i are with each other, enjoying our home, is off. she‚Äôs short and avoidant when im around now. i don‚Äôt wanna make her feel uncomfortable because they‚Äôve been in each others lives for so long and i never want to be the girlfriend that breaks up friendships but i really just don‚Äôt think it was a good idea to move her in. i feel uncomfortable even being in the home, i moved some of my things out because i felt like a burden and idk really where to go from here other than leave and not destroy their friendship but as a partner i would never wanna make my loved one feel like this. 

however they both make me feel like im the asshole because as much as i‚Äôve tried, my nervous system is all over the place and i can‚Äôt bring myself to like her. i never feel like this with other women, if anything i was excited to have another girl around the house but now it‚Äôs just bothersome for me to have her in our space.",1,1730139967.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False

Join me for two sessions of Blood on the Clocktower, the megahit social deduction game. If you've ever played Werewolf or Mafia, you know the drill - most of the players are innocent townsfolk, but a few of them are secretly evil and want to destroy the town before they're caught and hanged. No one is ever eliminated entirely, and each player has a unique special ability they can use to subvert the other team. It's an incredibly fun and approachable game of logic, bluffing and betrayal.

Chaotic Good Cafe, our hosts, just opened on the UWS, and I'd love to help them find their community. They're a cozy board game cafe with excellent atmosphere, even more excellent coffee, and a huge selection of games. They'll be providing wine half off to anyone who signs up, as well as candy and other prizes. And personally, I want to see y'all in costume!

I'm a deeply experienced Storyteller and will be teaching the game, so no preparation required. I also highly encourage players of all genders, sexualities, races, game experience levels, etc. to join - the Blood on the Clocktower community is one of the most welcoming I've found in the hobby game scene, and I make an effort to include everyone. By default these sessions will focus on beginner-friendly base 3 games, but all players are welcome.

The address is 200 W 84th St. Games are ages 21+ and will run in two chunks, from 6 to 8 PM and 8 to 10 PM. We'll ask for $30 per person for unlimited play.  If you're interested, sign up for a session or two at the links below:

1ge9882,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1ge9882/anyone_else_feel_like_theyre_perceived_as/,Anyone else feel like they're perceived as bothersome or a burden?,"**TL;DR:** Feel like a burden or bothersome to others because of my past trauma, about which I previously trauma dumped but now go to therapy for and am healing from (so no longer engage in trauma dumping). Life is just study, workout, and finding ways to kill the time while trying to maintain good mental and physical health. The phone never rings and my calendar is empty. Therapy, parenting and distraction help but...life is too quiet.

Some context ‚Äì I'm (late 30s MtF) the eldest of 4. My parents were always too busy or tired to pay me and my closest sibling attention. I feel like I had to grow up too fast. I struggled with gender dysphoria from a very young age ‚Äì I so badly wanted to be a girl ‚Äì which made it hard to socialise with other kids ‚Äì girls didn't include me and boys found me to be too ""effeminate"" and I got bullied. I would also get told off a lot by my family for being too ""girly"" or ""gay"". (Ironically, after I grew out hair in my late teens I would often got mistaken for a girl.) I came out as trans as a teen and my parents and extended family rejected me, and my relationship with them all never recovered. I emigrated in my early 20s to create space between me and my family after I failed to transition in my home country. I fell into a relationship with a lovely girl (who had her own problems) and we co-depended on each other for 15 years and had 2 kids together. (Far from home with no friends, she became my whole world.) She always knew I was trans ‚Äì I came out to her before we were an item and we frequently talked about my transition ‚Äì but when it finally came to me starting the process, she left to live with her bf and we got divorced. She was accepting but didn't want to remain married.

Fast forward 4 years and I am perceived as just another middle-aged woman/mom by strangers. (I know this because I get asked questions (always to my surprise) by medical professionals and other strangers that are relevant only people born F.) I am still friendly with my ex (since happily re-married with children) and we co-parent (our two under 12) well, but we no longer spend time together.

I went through 2 years of therapy, got diagnosed with ADHD and depression, and I strongly suspect I have CPTSD. I overcame the grief of divorce and am processing the issues that stem from my childhood and teen years. I have come so far and I am proud of myself. I am medicated. I am healing. I am happy and calm when I used to be frustrated, bitter, depressed and angry. I practice acceptance and gratitude and I romanticise my every day and see the beauty in little things. I am objectively a much better person now. I told my parents I forgive them and that I love them. I apologised to my ex for not being the partner she deserved. I apologised to my children for the chaotic nature of their very early childhood. I work hard every day at being a really involved, compassionate, and loving parent.

My biggest present struggle is that I have no other adults in my life. My phone never rings. I never get any emails or messages. I‚Äôm never invited anywhere. I lost my job last year and none of my colleagues ever reach out. I've discussed this at length with my therapist and I have gotten better with being alone. I date myself (treat myself to a new book, or a coffee out, cinema trip), I'm learning to be my own best friend and be the parent to my inner child that she should have had.

I tried this thing where instead of reaching out to others and getting ignored or left on read for weeks or months on end, I stopped making the first move and instead see how long it takes people to reach out to me. And guess what, now I don‚Äôt talk to anyone, because no one ever makes the first move.

I just feel like a burden or a bother to everyone. I‚Äôm that trans person they know who trauma dumped their messy divorce, overshared their transition, and had/has mental health problems.

I am sure others can relate to elements of this story. I see you and you're not alone. I wish for us some loving people in our life with whom we can make memories with and help one another make our time on this Earth just a little bit more magical and special.",2,1730139793.0,lonely,0,1.0,False

Dose: N/A



August 13 2024, some time around 3-3:30pm I decided to take a hike through The Wissahickon Valley Creek Park. It was humid, summer was in full bloom. As the result of some storm, many trees had freshly fallen, landing perpendicular to the walking trail. I climbed my way through all of them, so it wasn‚Äôt unlikely that a touch of poison ivy or a few bug bites were to be had.



By the time I returned to the car and laid my hand on the steering wheel, I noticed three hive like bumps in a scalene formation at the top of my right wrist. Slightly itchy, I didn‚Äôt think much of it, except to apply a pea-sized dab of ointment when I got home.¬†



When the sun set, the three bumps had mostly gone but were still slightly visible. The itch had become a tingle.¬†



Sitting behind computer desk in bedroom with headphones on at around 9:30pm, I was struck by an unmistakably strong psychoactive rush, lulling me into a trance‚Ä¶ As though my brain stem had cracked open to release a serum up and down my spinal cord, up into my brain, and down into my pelvic floor.¬†



Only slightly alarmed that I was being overtaken by an unknown high, perhaps distracted by the slightly sedative nature of the wave, I found my head involuntarily tracing a figure-eight in mid-air, as my body sank deeply into the chair underneath me.¬†



The back of my neck now being fully supported by the back of my chair, this figure-eight pattern evolved into a steady back and forth pendulum-like swing, which felt 100% synchronized with a very specific frequency‚Ä¶ A tunnel of light encompassed me, and this would mark the first time that night I felt my self ascending.



I distinctly remember, that despite being pleasantly lost in this feeling, I should be deeply alarmed.¬† And this fear was that my brain had been bio-hacked, in a way that would begin to flood my pineal gland with DMT at an exponential rate, until I was dead. The second most paranoid thought being that I had been poisoned by a member of my family (or some random person, perhaps hired by my family) in order to ‚Äúget rid‚Äù of this failure of a human being, yet, in the nicest way possible.¬†



Premonitions entered my head, of recent events leading up to this moment, which, in this frame of mind, felt deeply symbolic. It wasn‚Äôt but a day prior that I sat on a hill, my most recent ex‚Äôs favorite hill, chewing on the end of a piece of yellow-indian grass, wishing instead that it was a shoot of hemlock with enough toxicity to end my life‚Ä¶ Well here {they} were, a day later, coming to grant my wish‚Ä¶ driving home I noticed a gravestone who‚Äôs epitaph yielded my initials‚Ä¶ And upon opening my eyes to check the time on my laptop, the number 13 (glowed) was an omen of death.



And with that, like the feeling of finally shooting up out of bed to turn the alarm clock off, I shoved a cigarette in my mouth and found my way down to the back porch, declaring that if this was going to be my last night on earth it would be underneath the stars with a cigarette in a my hand.¬†



The moment I reached the back steps I shuttered in awe of the intense sight before me; the night sky like I had never seen it before. Pink and Indigo cliffs hanging onto eternity. Wide-eyed starring into it, I (embarrassingly enough) proclaimed ‚ÄúOh Baby, I feel you‚Ä¶‚Äù over and over again. The night sky was an entity that was perceiving me.¬†



I was scared of the intensity at this point. Since the peaking was unknown and unexpected, It felt like death rapidly approaching.



As I collapsed to the floor, I began to eke out a sort of hymnal that chanted ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and ‚ÄúI hate you‚Äù simultaneously. Im sure it sounded pathetic, albeit involuntary.



I stayed on my back, aligning with the rhythm of the frequency that moved thru me from upstairs. Head bobbing back and forth, forcefully. This frequency become harder to concentrate, causing my body to vibrate unpredictably, until my muscles seized, and I fell into fetal position‚Ä¶ Traveling thru a tunnel, saw many things, however, one final vision caused me to gag and burp. Upon waking from it, I remember feeling as though I had been healed, tantrically.¬†



I smoked my cigarette and upon realizing that I left the pack upstairs, a fierce trial stood before me. Still unsure of whether or not I would be dying tonight, the last thing I wanted to do was go back into the house. I somehow developed the notion that each time I go back upstairs would be another rung of hell I would descend, concluding in a very low-vibrational afterlife‚Ä¶



I stepped into the living room, stared up the staircase, and could hear demons taunting me‚Ä¶ trying to trick me up the steps. I felt my bed coaxing at me, tempting that if I slumber, may never wake up again. I traveled up the staircase, grabbed the pack, got overwhelmed by another wave quickly approaching, (this one stronger than the last) and headed straight back to the porch.



When I got outside, I again, laid on my back feeling as though rigor mortis was setting in. I remember thinking that I was destine to be mummified‚Ä¶ In some glass sarcophagi, then shot into space. That being said, I wanted to die straight up. Trying my best to hold my horizontal stature upright, the head lulled back into that synchronized rhythm‚Ä¶ I became a sperm cell. Coordinates befell the earth as I left it‚Ä¶ Upwards I went, and the more and more in-tune this frequency possessed me, the more and more in-focus become the tunnel of ascension all around me.



This tunnel revealed to me, wisdom, love, purpose, true judgement, and compassion. Compassion for myself, even. Words fail me in trying to articulate the depth of oneness as I rode this peak. I was communicating with entities with clarity, who could understand my ever most inner thoughts. At a certain point, the height of this vibrational wave brought me to an almost static place, where an environment with a gate would not let me pass. And if I‚Äôm remembering correctly, they had a pretty good reason why‚Ä¶¬†



A few more of these static environments were reached within this particular wave, and each time I was met by an entity, jovial but firm, the message seemed to be that It was not my time to pass on from this place‚Ä¶ At one scene it was a train I was unable to board, another was a vault door that couldn‚Äôt be cracked, and lastly, it was a white light that raced down a wormhole; in trying to follow this white light, I quickly realized the labyrinthine complexity one would have to untangle in order to reach it. Hesitant at the threshold of its gate, I heard a voice say,

	‚Äúyou will never find it now, don‚Äôt get lost‚Äù I understood, ‚Äúit is the fear of death that is keeping me alive‚Äù¬†



I got up and smoked another cigarette. When I looked at the night sky it was not as vivid as before, yet whole as it ever was. Within the silhouettes of the trees I saw a massive, jumping spider staring straight into my soul, as if I was a bug caught in its web. I tried to breathe and stretch in order to ground myself as best as I could. However, at my expense, another wave approached.



Another wave locking me back into the same position as before. I closed my eyes. I saw through the earth, as if it was not there. Into deep space. It was very black save for some very distant stars that laced the background. This depth of vacuous space quivered‚Ä¶ rippled at the edges of my periphery‚Ä¶ and was revealed to be nothing more than a reflection in a pool.¬†



Beyond the pool, emerged, what appeared to be, an Nth dimensional tesseract, wriggling through nothingness like a worm does through dirt.¬†



This worm was fractal in nature, had a reserve of never-ending detail to zoom in to hidden underneath its macronomy. It was traveling in a spiral pattern from the third to the second quadrant of my vision. At its crown was a spiral of energy trailing behind it. It was devouring itself internally as it expanded.¬†



As I came back to a somewhat grounded positioning yet again, I thought to myself ‚Äúwhere is norm the cat? I wonder where he‚Äôs been.‚Äù Norm is a neighborhood cat that blesses the backyards of every house in the area with kindness and benevolence, (If you believe in that sort of thing) and I haven‚Äôt seen him in about a year. In fact, the last time I had seen him, was the last time I ate mushrooms. I was enjoying the experience by painting and drawing in my garage, when Norm came up to me and begged for attention, which I happily offered‚Ä¶



Anyhow, not but 10 seconds had passed since randomly pondering Norms whereabouts, when I suddenly heard (what at first sounded to be) a cat, mewing in the tonality ‚ÄúI luuvv youu‚Äù (as house cats will sometimes do). However, as the repetitions persisted‚Äî and as the last note stretched out of the vocal cords of whatever creature this happened to be, a bird-like stutter cawed‚Ä¶ The repetitions persisted, (every time now more unique than the last) and warped into hideous dissonance, as it faded away at a supreme pace.¬†



I still have no idea what that was... I genuinely don‚Äôt believe that it was a cat, and I don‚Äôt believe that it was a bird either. Norm the cat never made a sound before‚Ä¶



There was so much more to it that is hard to chronicle and hard to articulate. It was a waking dream, that granted me a glimpse of enlightenment, and made me absolutely submit to the abyss‚Ä¶ I felt like I died three times and woke up from it like a dream each time. I have no idea what it was or if anyone has any idea that I experienced it. I might be dead as I recount the experience for all I know. We may all be dead as we live. Walking corpses awaiting an ancient recollection, and a purposeful rebirth. No idea.¬†



At the final come down from this trip (which lasted about 7-8 hours total) I went inside to make a cup of coffee (at 5am) and when I looked at the top of my right wrist, all of the hairs around the site of those initial hives, were standing straight up in a circle, like Stonehenge on the back of my hand. When I rubbed the area with my fingers, it was pleasurable and sent waves, chills, and shivers throughout my entire body.¬†



My most intuitive guess, is that I have been (if not dosed by transdermal LSD or DMT) introduced to a sort of psychedelic virus‚Ä¶ or perhaps a viral alien technology‚Ä¶ Perhaps virus‚Äô are much older than we think? Much more intelligent than we think‚Ä¶ Maybe I was just bit by a strange spider‚Ä¶



I know that all sounds so cr... crazy, but‚Ä¶ I literally didn‚Äôt take any drugs‚Äî and that happened all night‚Ä¶ Into the next two days, experiencing waves that creeped through my blood in the same way that a fever does. Not to mention the dreams:



All I can recollect from the first dream, was opening my eyes at the top of a hundred foot wave that never crashed, in the middle of a distant ocean, with some alien landscape on the horizon‚Ä¶ Despite feeling my bed underneath me, my eyes were open, and I knew I was dreaming, yet my vision reflected differently. Then I closed my eyes and cant remember.



The second dream didn‚Äôt occur until the next night; I saw from the point of view of myself as a child, jumping down into the basement of my parents house playing ‚Äòtag your it‚Äô with an old family friend. My point of view gradually become closer and closer to the ground as I tracked their movements around the staircase, laterally. As if I had become a jumping spider, maneuvering around the center of my web‚Ä¶ Locking onto their movements as they searched for me, snapping my fingers exactly once, to misdirect them, and then finally sneaking up from behind and tagging them. Suddenly, I heard applause from elsewhere‚Ä¶ as if I had passed a trial. Like it was all just a simulation. A simulation for how I might do as an insect in the wild, however, in the context of a friendly game of tag‚Ä¶





During another dream, I felt as if I was being observed by a space ship. shining a green light on me, exposing me in the darkness, wanting to communicate‚Ä¶¬†



However, I must confess... I fear the word ‚Äòdream' may not do these visions justice, for they each felt as lucid as reality.



All in all, I feel absolutely cleansed and unbothered by the common trivialities of life. Depression is gone, anxiety is wiped, I feel like my existence is purposeful again‚Ä¶ Death will be there for all of us when we are ripe for the shedding. Everything¬†



I would be willing to accept that powerful trips on hard psychedelics are nothing more than a figment of ones imagination, just like a dream that is random and has no meaning‚Ä¶ That is, If I had smoked DMT out of a bong, or engaged in an ayahuasca ceremony for example‚Ä¶



But I did not voluntarily take anything.¬†



So what the fuck WAS that?



P.S: I found a note later on that week written in my handwriting, although I can't remember writing it, it read as follows,¬†

You enrolled into university and you should respect yourself to not drop out when harder periods come. Think only one day at a time and be happy for every single day you manage to study. 

2. Mix up subjects üìö
Unless it's something due that day, you should study more classes at the same time. It's not the best option to be on the top of the class in one course, and in the bottom for another. 

3. Get enough sleep üò¥  
You can't really pull all day studying while on coffees and barely holding your eyes open. 

4. Know your schedule and priorities üìù
Make a study plan and know what you need to do for a day. It'll help you stay on track and prioritize tasks. 

5. Make a nice study environment üßë‚Äçüíª
Have a clean desk, quiet place and no distractions. Take regular breaks and other small things to keep you motivated. 

All of these tips help you maintain diversity and feeling of how each study day is different.
