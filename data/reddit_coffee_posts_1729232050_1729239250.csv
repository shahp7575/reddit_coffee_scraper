1g6d19k,https://www.reddit.com/r/bulimia/comments/1g6d19k/new_to_this_sub_i_think_i_have_a_problem/,New to this sub I think I have a problem ..,I’ve been eating A LOT mostly at night and then I suddenly decided I should just throw it up. Then since I don’t have anymore food I think maybe I should have another big snack then immediately after I throw up again. I can’t help but think this might be normal but I love to eat I just feel disgusting after like I over eat. but I’ll have like 3 different servings of different food in front of me and finish them all then immediately regret it. I never had this before and it’s been 3 days straight of doing that. I feel like shit right now and I hate this feeling even after I throw up. I don’t ever want to eat again it’s disgusting me. I don’t exercise at all so this is my only option. I also hate my body when some of my friends told me they would be happy with my weight and I get so annoyed bc I didn’t ask them to say that I’m not fishing for compliments I was just genuinely say I should lose weight. It’s like don’t compare yourself to me or make me feel like I should be happy where I’m at. Does that make sense? Then I think when I’m eating people are looking at me so I don’t eat in front of other people now. It makes me nervous that they’re are judging my amount of servings or the way I prepare my food maybe it’s “too much”. Especially my mom I hate when she looks at how much creamer I put in my coffee like why are u watching me? I called her out and she said I was crazy she didn’t do that. I know she did tho and I can’t help but think my mom and sisters instilled this in me. They are all in great shape. Now my sisters working out and it’s making me jealous and like I should start too. I think I should start to look into working out and intermittent fasting again. I hate feeling like shit my fukin head hurts and stomach. This is such a disgusting feeling. I want to cry but nothing comes out of my eyes. & no one understands me if I say this outloud I’ll be “crazy” I think I might have body dismorphia bc I was over weight by a lot for my body type and I had NO IDEA. I look back at those pictures and I can’t believe I was that big. When I would buy bigger pants at that time my mom would tell me no just lose weight but I was like “what about in the mean time?” Am I just supposed to squeeze in a size medium when I’m clearly a large X-Large at the time? Now I wear baggy clothes I don’t want people to look at me or judge me and I feel like my face is swollen. I feel so nauseous and disgusting right now. I just wanted to let this out to someone at least.,1,1729239089.0,bulimia,0,1.0,False

I played and enjoyed calico, but I wish for more! I loved the food prep aspect. I’ve explored my cat options but wish for a game where all I did was make people cute coffee beverages and maybe draw latte art? I want the most “stressful” aspect to be low key, like maybe simply unlocking specific recipes or something like you do in calico. I loved the calico aesthetic but it could be any aesthetic really as long as it plays on steam deck or, I guess ps5 or Xbox. I just play all my cozies while reclining, so pc is a no go. The deck is better because I can take it to medical appointments. I do own a switch also if it’s switch only. 

Cats are not a necessity but I also accept cute cat game recs (I’ve played and enjoyed stray and little kitty big city also). I’m not super into business management but it’s okay as long as it’s not stressful! Like animal crossing kind of farming and selling haha. 

And while this will be unpopular here, no pixel art please (low poly 3d stuff is great tho!). I just can’t handle the overly pixelated stuff in my brain, especially when colorized. I don’t know why.  It gets all jumbled up when it moves.",1,1729238823.0,CozyGamers,0,1.0,False

I don't know how to tell you this without scaring you, so I probably won't. I don't want to scare you. I will miss you, wherever I go, and I do not know where that is. I fixated on Hamlet from a young age, because I was consumed by fears of the uncertainty of death, and chased by a longing for it. and I don't know what it is and I don't know how to die.

the river is cold, the river is shallow, a working river, a carousel of lumber and barges and fenced-off shorelines. the river is wide and I love you. I love you so much and never did you have any hand in this. and it could be good if it was just you and you have brought my life untold happiness. and I will miss you, I know I will. we were the happiest two people in the world, we were glowing, we were blazing.

is it like moving to another country? I have done that before. is it like the friends I had to leave behind constantly in school, who's names I forget and who's faces blur? what can I take with me, what must I leave behind? I have so many questions. Will it be a train, or a carriage or a highway or a bike?  will I have the courage to say good bye to you? will you be angry with me? will all of them, the others, be angry with me? you know them better than I do.

my head hurts. I feel dizzy. I wish I could love enough to endure pain. I wish I could love enough. and I fear I twist inside you like a roundworm, I fear, that my wanting love means I am not deserving of it. I fear I burrow, I fear that I need you more than you need me. I tremble, when you talk, of how one day, we will have been together decades, talk of houses, and the families that can be built and the pets and the walls and the words and I want it all and I want nothing.

help me help m help me I cannot save myself and you cannot save me. and I love you and I love you and I always will. and I will miss you, with the seals and the sturgeons and the deadheads and the algae. against strong currents and cloudy water, against sunken busses and lost car keys and discarded coffee cups I will miss you. and I do not know what to do with that.",1,1729238819.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

1g6cy3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/partyplanning/comments/1g6cy3l/advice_on_amount_of_drinks/,Advice on amount of drinks,"Hi! I'm planning a party in early December for 50-60 people and I soon have to order the drinks already. I have an idea, but I always struggle with estimating the amount of drinks necessary so any tips are greatly appreciated! 

The location is a student associations bar, which limits the possibilities a bit, so no coffee/tea or other hot drinks. We're doing beer, wine, craft beer and non-alcoholic options. I'm mainly seeking advice on the amounts, not the type of drinks per se.

Guests: 50-60 people, most in their twenties or thirties. Most drink a bit, but not extreme. Some might let loose a bit who knows. Some non-drinkers.
The drinks are very cheap and what we can't finish will probably be bought back, which is a luxery, so I'd rather have a bit too much.

What I'm thinking of now:
- unlimited beer (beer on tap)
- 3 bottles of red wine
- 3 bottles of white wine
- 2 or 3 crates of craft beers (24 bottles a crate)
- 1 crate of non-alcoholic beer
- 7 bottles of soda (5 types)
- 12 bottles of tequila beer

We'll also have snacks, but I have more time to think about those (tips are welcome, but I'll probably do some easy snacks as there isn't really a fridge available).

Any tips? Thanks in advance! ",1,1729238672.0,partyplanning,0,1.0,False

I joined a startup earlier this year as a developer, drawn by the attractive pay and convenient location. However, I’ve encountered some challenges regarding the company’s policies and work environment that I’m finding difficult to navigate:

1. **Working Hours:** 9 AM - 6 PM, Monday to Saturday.
2. **Paid Leave:** 8 days annually, requiring a 15-day notice; otherwise, they are unpaid.
3. **Holidays:** Only three recognized holidays (Independence Day, Republic Day, Gandhi Jayanti).
4. **Amenities:** No recreational activities, snacks, or access to tea/coffee facilities.
5. **Late Policy:** Even being 1-2 minutes late results in a half-day deduction, but there’s no compensation for working beyond 6 PM, which is expected.
6. **Development Tools:** The company uses local servers without version control (e.g. GitLab) due to concerns over data security. Developers are expected to manage code changes manually and keeping copy pasting different versions.
7. **Internet Access:** Restricted, with no access to online resources.
8. **Work from Home:** Not permitted, as it's believed employees may not stay focused.
9. **Saturdays:** No flexibility for Saturday off, as ""we can’t afford that much leave.""

The workload is relatively light, and I’m able to complete my tasks in 3-4 hours. However, the expectation to remain at the office for the entire duration feels excessive. Additionally, there is a lack of unity among colleagues, and efforts to address these concerns as a team have not been successful, leaving me feeling isolated when approaching management.

I’m considering changing companies, but having been here only five months, I’m unsure how leaving this early might impact my career profile.

I’d appreciate any advice on how to handle this situation or how to navigate a potential job change under these circumstances.",1,1729238661.0,IndianWorkplace,2,1.0,False

It says much without saying a word. 

[***Women's dresses***](http://eraofnarii.com/), for example, afford endless opportunities to embrace style and celebrate individuality, shining anywhere and anytime desired. Whether it's casual, formal, or something in between, having the right dress will make all the difference.

Sometimes, let's take a look at **different dresses for women** and how to nail your look, whatever the occasion may be.

# Casual Dresses: Effortless Style, yet Laid-Back Vibes

Casual dresses are, like, a big friend of yours when comfort is on the agenda without compromising on style. 

These dresses will work out simply for brunch with your girls or even a quick shopping spree, fitting just fine between looking fabulous and feeling like one is literally wrapped in a cloud.

# 1. T-Shirt Dresses: Fashion Meets Comfort

A T-shirt dress is the embodiment of laid-back cool. It's just that perfect hybrid of casual and cute. 

Just slip on a pair of chunky sneakers, and boom-you're good to go. Plain, striped, or graphic, this dress screams major street-style appeal. Pair it up with a denim jacket if the weather is trying to play tricks on you.

# 2. Wrap Dresses: Flattering for All Body Types

The wrap dress is one of those timeless pieces: an adjustable waistline that cinches at just that right spot in the body, creating the hourglass shape that flatters everyone. 

This is your go-to for casual dinners or a day at the office that stretches into happy hour. What's beautiful about wrap dresses is that they come in every color, pattern, and fabric imaginable, so you're spoiled for choice.

# 3. Sundresses: Soak Up the Sun in Style

Sundresses, the moment the first sunbeam appears, come into fashion. Light and airy, they scream summer. 

Just think about sipping iced coffee right by the beach or meandering through a flower market in one flowy sundress. Match that with strappy sandals, and you're living the best of summer.

# Formal Dresses: Where Occasion Meets Elegance

Formal dresses save the day for those really fancy affairs, asking one to up their game in fashion. 

Think wedding events, gala events, or a once-in-a-blue-moon black-tie event. These dresses scream sophistication but in a way that still feels like 'you'.

# 1. Evening Gowns: For the Absolutely Striking Look

When the invitation says formal, you reach for an evening gown. Think long, dramatic silhouettes that sweep across the floor. 

Whether sleek satin or adorned with sequins in a mermaid-style gown, evening gowns are totally about making that memorable entrance. Accessorize with dazzling jewelry and a sleek updo for that red carpet-moment.

# 2. Cocktail Dresses: Ready to Party in an Instant

Not too formal yet fancy is where cocktail dresses come in. They are your mainstays for weddings, parties at work, or semi-formal dinners. 

A little shorter than evening gowns but still polished, they come in different forms, such as A-line or bodycon. Whether sipping champagne or tearing up the dance floor, a cocktail dress has got you covered.

# 3. Maxi Dresses: The Underrated Formal Hero

Maxi dresses aren't just for the beach. If done right, they can easily be translated into formal events. Look toward luxe fabrics like silk or chiffon to see it for yourself. 

A formal maxi dress with a high slit or plunging neckline balances comfort and glam like a perfect mix.

# Occasion-Specific Dress Hacks

# 1. The Perfect Date Night Dress: Flirty and Fun

On date night, you want to give off both looks and personality. That's when the slip dress comes in-sleek, slightly daring, effortlessly cool, and screaming in satin, velvet, or lace, ""I am ready to turn heads."" 

If you want a little edge, pair it with a leather jacket and ankle boots, or classic with heels and red lips.

# 2. The Ideal Wedding Guest Dress: Classy, Not Flashy

Weddings are tricky, tricky territory-you wanna stand out, yet not too much. This is where the midi dress comes in: elegant without doing too much. 

Florals or pastel prints are safe options, but the real deal is jewel tones. Remember, you need to be respectful toward the bride while looking the most fabulous. Go for the flowy fabrics that call for dancing through the night.

# 3. Work Event Dresses: Where Business Meets Chic

Dinners or conferences-anything corporate-requires something a tad more polished. That is where a more structured sheath dress comes in as your MVP of the evening. 

It's fitted without being tasteless, professional without being too severe. Throw some oomph into it with an added blazer for that power moment, or simply add a statement necklace to mix things up. 

Neutral tones will keep you safe, but also let loose with deep burgundies or a pine forest green.

# Conclusion

There are **different dresses for women,** for every occasion, from casual T-shirt dresses to immaculate evening gowns. 

But no matter what type of dress or style of wearing you’re pulling off, confidence is key. It is all about owning the style, whether it be while hitting the beach in a sundress or dazzling the crowd in a cocktail number. 

Fashion is not just about adhering to trends; it's also about an expression of who you really are at any given moment.

1g6cvur,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g6cvur/2_months_out_of_a_break_up_and_this_is_what_i/,2 months out of a break up and this is what I have learned,"Today I am officially 2 months out of a break up with someone I loved dearly. IT DOES GET BETTER. I PROMISE. 

He got into a rebound 3 weeks after our BU. I know he wasn’t cheating on me, I know how he met the girl but that’s a long story. To say the least I was devastated. Absolutely devastated. I had initiated NC immediately after our bu, tho we did not unfollow each other, but I did not and still do not engage with any of his stories or posts. Here’s what I have to say about all this- 

GO NO CONTACT -Seriously go no contact. I mean it. I know it’s hard but trust me and everyone else who preaches it, it helps. And it will not only show them how much strength and will power you have, but most importantly it will prove to yourself how much strength and willpower you have. Also a plus is, most the time the dumper expects you to beg, if you don’t, they will question if maybe you wanted to end things too. 

Feel your emotions- whatever comes up feel it. Something that helped me was writing letters ( THAT I WOULD NEVER SEND) to him. If it was sadness, anger or whatever I wrote it in a letter to him. Find a way to feel it and get it out of your system 

Rebounding- don’t do it. And if your ex is doing, I promise that means you win. When I found out he was with another girl it felt like the final slice through my heart. Funny enough that has almost helped me move on faster. Even tho I don’t engage with his social media at all, I have friends who still view his stories and he is posting non stop with this girl. And in my heart of hearts I know it’s to get a reaction from me but I’m not viewing it and he will not get one. If your ex is doing the same do not give them the satisfaction. 

Social media- if you two didn’t unfollow or block each other, don’t engage with your ex. Part of no contact. If blocking or unfollowing is needed for your situation, do it. If it’s not, do not engage. It’s a nice little blow to their ego and it’s part of nc. DO NOT POST ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. I have always only posted a story about once a week. I stuck with that and have never posted anything about our breakup, just archived the posts of us.  

Keep living your life and live your best one yet- 
I implemented this in the midst of a heartbreak. I went on a mini vacation with my girls, I have been to 3 concerts, and I have plans to fly into another city for Halloween weekend for a huge party I got invited to. My life is not going to end bc I got dumped and neither is yours. Get up, go get a coffee, take a scenic drive, listen to music, talk to your friends and family, watch a movie, take a walk, do everything in your power to not only continue living your life but to improve it. And a huge part of improving it, is also reflecting on what areas of the relationship you could’ve been better in. Reflecting on what qualities you didn’t like about them. Reflecting on what you want in your next one and how you will show up in your next one. This is a huge step in closure. People always talk about getting closure from someone when truthfully if you self reflect you will find it eventually. I’m not saying I don’t still have some days that it still stings, but I’m writing this only 2 months after a break up bc I have healed immensely by doing all these things. It absolutely will get better. Best of luck to all of you, you will come out on the other end! ",1,1729238387.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Are you sick of the dating scene's shallowness? Me too! I'm a 29 year old Mechanical Engineer, and also the master of late night drives to the middle of nowhere!

What I Seek: A woman who's up for cracking bad jokes, debating the merits of pineapple on pizza, and maybe even embarking on spontaneous adventures (like exploring that sketchy-looking woods down the street).

Why You Should Hit Me Up: If you're tired of swiping left on boring bios and are ready to dive into the weird and wonderful world of genuine connection, then let's chat! Who knows, we might just discover we're both secretly wizards or have a shared passion for collecting campervan money boxes.

So, if you're ready to add a splash of quirkiness to your life and see where it takes us, shoot me a message with your name, a pic of yourself, and the worst dad joke you can think of, so I know you've read this far!

A good friend of mine is going to visit Japan in a few weeks, he will mostly side within major cities. Since he knows that I really enjoy pour over coffee and I once nerded out about Hario from Japan, he offered me to bring me something from abroad. Because I have not been to Japan and I don't know how to get any information, I thought I would reach out here. Are there any special mugs or coffee beans or something coffee related that would make a nice attribution to my coffee corner?

1g6cmc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/1g6cmc8/kiwi_guy/,Kiwi Guy,"Freshman year of college, I met this guy. We lived in the same dorm and were part of the same Living Learning Community (LLC), which is a program my university had for freshman so they could meet people with similar interests. My particular LLC had an additional class to go along with it. I officially met KG in that class, and we got along well enough. We really only talked when the professor had us discuss in groups and I didn't see him outside of class much. Every now and then we'd pass each other on campus and maybe wave or stop for a short chat.



Soon, classes started to ramp up. I was an architecture major, and sadly it became common for me to get back to my dorm well after 2:00 in the morning. Thankfully, I lived close and would typically walk back with a friend anyway. Plus, campus was well lit, and my dorm was a straight shot from the architecture building. I felt completely safe, even walking alone. Normally, when I got back no one would be in the common area, which I had to walk past to get to my room. But it wouldn't be strange for a group (of guys, typically) to be hanging out, playing pool, etc. This is where I would most often run into KG during freshman year. He'd wave, and if I was awake and aware enough to notice him, I'd wave back. Sometimes he'd just be coming back too and would hold the door open for me, and we'd talk for a bit.



He seemed nice enough, though I didn't know him that well. We had the same type of humor, and he was easy to talk to. But as a few months went by, things started to pop up. No red-flags or anything disturbing, just...odd. Random. One day, I ran into him on my way back from the campus store. We talked for a bit, and he asked if I wanted a chopstick. As he said this, he pulled out a pair of chopsticks, the kind we got from the dining hall. He said they were extra and that he didn't need them. Personally, I find random and semi-chaotic things pretty funny, and the thought of telling my friends how a guy just handed me chopsticks made me laugh. So, I took them. They were still in the packaging, but it was just the royal bamboo brand. Thinking back on it, I wouldn't have known if they'd been used or not. I don't remember what I did with them.



That interaction struck me as slightly strange, but I brushed it off, thinking he was just being quirky. I had a lot of friends that I could see doing the same thing and just acting random and chaotic to be funny, but only among our friend group. Not to a near stranger.



Nothing else of note happened freshman year. Sophomore year, sadly, is another story.



Early fall semester, I went to the dining hall alone. While I like eating with others, I enjoyed the time to myself to just watch a show or listen to a podcast. After I finished, I happened to pass KG on my out. He was sitting down, also by himself. We got to talking about summer, classes, etc. Somehow, we got on the topic of my dress, and I mentioned how I wished it had pockets. He mentioned he knew how to sew; we talked about hobbies for a bit, and then I left. A few weeks later, we had almost repeat interaction, except this time we got there at the same time. He was already set with his food, so he followed me around as I got mine, and then I sat down with him. It was a regular conversation, but I got the impression that he wasn't really listening to my responses, instead just preparing what he was going to say next. Often, it wouldn't have anything to do with what we were talking about. Or it would be sort of random again. For instance, we were talking about work, and he said his coworker told him he was just like Jesus.



Interesting. I asked in what way, he said the guy just said some verses from Ephraim (not a book in the Bible) or Ecclesiastes. Okay then. Another example, during the same conversation, he said if I was ever bored, he had an Xbox at his apartment (we no longer lived in the same dorm). That's all well and good, but we weren't talking about anything to do with games or boredom. He was like this throughout the conversation. Anyways, we ended up switching numbers, and the next day I added him on Snapchat.



This is where things begin to get weird. Given KG's comments about sewing and Xbox, I got the idea that maybe he liked me, though I wasn't sure how I felt. He added me back on SC, and we had a short conversation about the weather. Out of the blue, he asked if I wanted him to bring me food. Once again, the topic of food or hunger hadn't come up. I was a bit weirded out but brushed it off. I sent him a picture of the snacks I had in my dorm saying I was all set but thank you.



We would snap every couple of days, I'd send him pictures of my messy desk and drawings, I don't remember what pictures he sent. Several more times, always out of the blue, he'd ask if he could bring me food, if I wanted him to bring me food, etc. I always said no, because I thought it was strange. If he was trying to ask me out, why wouldn't he ask if I wanted to go somewhere and get food with him? Or do something together? That approach makes more sense to me, rather than bringing me some unspecified meal. Also, there was the question of, would he stay with me while I ate it? Or would he drop it off and leave? If it was the latter, I knew I'd feel guilty, like I was using him. Not to mention, if he was trying to ask me out, why wouldn't he change up his approach, especially since I kept turning him down?



Finally, there came a time where I mentioned I was cold, and he asked if I wanted him to bring me coffee. I was tempted, because coffee sounded pretty nice. And at least I knew what I'd be getting. But then came the questions. Would he pay for it? I didn't want him to, because then I'd feel like I owed him something. I was also trying to save money, so I didn't want to buy my own coffee. Plus, it was raining (hence the cold), and I didn't want him to go to the trouble of walking in the storm. To top it off, I didn't really want him in my studio anyway (architecture classroom). I had already decided I wasn't interested in him like that but would continue to be semi-friends with him, and I was afraid if I let him buy/bring me food I'd be leading him on.



So, I turned him down, again.



Later, around dinner time, he asked if I liked kiwis. I told him I'd never actually had one before.



 He asked if I'd like him to bring me one. At this point, I just appreciated that I knew what I'd be getting and (theoretically) there was no money involved. I said sure. Later that evening he showed up at my dorm, in a black trench coat. (This is the first I've seen in person in several months, every other interaction had been over Snapchat). Right after I let him in, before we even made it to the kitchen, he pulled from the depths of his coat a set of knives. They were pretty shiny, and I admired them. I knew he liked to cook, so it made sense to me that he would have them. Going into the kitchen, we chatted while he pulled out two kiwis and washed them and I sat down at a nearby table. He came over and gave me the one he had cut in half, sitting across from me. As I'm spooning out the fruit, I notice he's just looking at me. I ask if he's going to eat his.



""Oh, they're both for you.""



That confused me a bit. He brought two kiwis, and was apparently planning on watching me eat both of them. I've never been comfortable in a situation where I'm the only one eating, so I joked/insisted that he eat the other one. I then watched as he grabbed the one in front of him, uncut, and bit into it. Skin and all. Apparently, you can do that. He proceeded to eat it like an apple, and then hinted that he hadn't had dinner yet. I had, and I had a paper to write. Against my better judgment, and wanting to procrastinate, I said I could eat. (In my defense, my first dinner sucked). Leaving for the dining hall, he recognized and waved to some people in my common room. I asked how he knew them; he said he was their weed friend last year.



Ah.



He assured me he hadn't partaken, only sold. Now, I'm not into drugs, and I try to steer of people who do. Nothing against them, but life is easier for me that way. Besides, I have asthma.



At dinner, we had another conversation just like the others, with a bunch of sudden topic changes. Leaving, I naturally went to the crosswalk near the dining hall, because I thought this was the end of our hangout. He'd have to cross the sidewalk to go home, and this is where I'd say goodbye. That didn't happen. We were just standing there, now, not moving. I asked where he was going.



""Oh, I was following you.""



Okay...and I had brought him to the crosswalk, a pretty big hint that this was over. With no polite way to tell him to go home, we ended up going back to my dorm. His friends weren't there, and with no reason to go into the kitchen, we just walked down the hallway. In no way did I want to bring him to my room, so I made a desperate turn into the vending machine room. We talked a bit in here, he looked at the candy and asked what my favorite was. These machines didn't have my favorite, and I joked that I was broke anyway, so it didn't matter.



Again, he offered to buy it for me. This at least had more context, and a better reason(?) Anyway, I thanked him but declined, not wanting to risk leading him on. We talked some more, until eventually I said I had to go write my paper. In response, he laid down on the counter. I laughed, so it wouldn't be awkward and because he was trying to be funny, and then walked him to the door. I couldn't just wave goodbye from inside because he was standing out there, waiting. I couldn't just stick my head out and wave either, because all the walls and doors are glass, and that'd look pretty weird. So, I stepped out. He made this move with his arm, I looked to me like he was going to hug me, and it resulted in a weird, side-hug moment. He looked at me and asked what that was, I joked I didn't know. He said he wanted to dap me up, so we did that. Three times. Then he left, disappearing into the night with his black trench coat and knives.



I don't see him again, and gradually over winter break our snaps stopped.



Now, it's February. I'd crossed paths with him a lot more, mainly on the way to the dining hall. We'd usually just wave and smile, sometimes he'd try and touch me, either with a high-five or fist bump to the shoulder. Once I ran into him in the dining hall, he asked me about winter break, and if I'd slain all my enemies. That's a bit of the quirkiness I was somewhat used to with my friends, so it didn't seem too weird to me. I ran into him another time though, and had an almost shot for shot conversation, including the 'slain enemies' line. I guess it was his new opener.



One day, I'm having lunch by myself. I had a good stretch of time to eat and relax before I had to give a presentation. Enjoying my food and my podcast, all of a sudden, my table starts to shake. It was wobbly anyway, so I thought someone bumped into it, until I saw something drop to the floor. Rushing to swallow, take out my earbuds, and clear the hair from my eyes, I look up and lock eyes with KG. He was sitting (uninvited) at my (very small) table and was incredibly obnoxious doing it. Granted, maybe that wasn't all his fault, but still. Now, I have an angry resting face anyways, and was feeling irritated, so I didn't try too hard to make my face look neutral. I said hello, but his only response was to quickly wag his finger near the side of his mouth, for an uncomfortable amount of time. Eventually, seeing that I wasn't getting it, he said I had something on my face. I wipe it away, but nothing was there. He looks confused, then shrugs.



""Huh. Guess it's dead skin.""



Just what every girl wants to hear.



I just look at him, growing more irritated. He decides to restart this interaction. He tells me he liked my hair (I had cut it) and asks about winter break (again), then asks/clarifies that I had a dog. I thanked him for the compliment, said yes, I had a dog and asked if he wanted to see pictures. He said yes, and as I'm going to pull up pictures, he says he'll show me pictures of the puppy his family put down.



Hearing the word 'puppy' I had begun to aww, but when he said 'put down' I wasn't sure what to do. It was so out of the blue. I don't think I said anything. When we showed the pictures, he said he was too sad, so he showed me pictures of another dog. Then--



""What do you think of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?""



I thought this was weird wording. Isn't the question, 'do you know Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?' Anyways, I said I liked Him. KG did an exaggerated thinking face, hand stroking the (nonexistent) beard and everything.

""Are you a Christian?""



""Yep.""



""Do you know what Monday school is?""



I asked if he meant Sunday School, but he was adamant that these kids he grew up with went to Monday school. I said I had no idea, maybe it was a different denomination, or just an after-school club. He shrugged, then said,



""I have a pentagram in my apartment.""



I nod, taken aback. ""Weird. Why?""



""It was left by the previous tenant.""



I'm imaging a big bloody pentagram, like the kind they use in horror movies. So, I jokingly ask if it's drawn in blood.



He pauses for a second, and his eyes seem to light up. ""Yes."" He then proceeds to go into how much blood, the type of blood, where it came from, etc. I zone out. Somewhere along the way he points at my food and calls it shit. It was lo mein, thank you very much, and delicious. Now my appetite is gone, and I'm progressively more irritated. In his defense, he did ask several times if I had somewhere to be. I should've taken the out, but since I technically didn't, I said no and stayed. I've since learned my lesson. At some point I ask how big this pentagram is, he holds up his hand, making a circle shape. So, smaller than a fist. That's a little underwhelming. He jokes that the person who drew was too lazy to finish, saying they didn't even draw the circle.



That's a star. If there's no circle, it's just a regular star.



We come to a lull in the conversation. He looks around, spots the napkin holder, and asks if I need one.



I shake my head. ""No thanks, I'm all good.""



He shrugs. ""Okay."" Grabbing a napkin, he folds it, tears off the corner, and eats it.



I'm in shock. We're just staring at each other, one person traumatized, the other eating a napkin. With no idea what to do, I tell him to swallow it. If he's making me experience this insanity, then he's going to swallow that napkin. Unfortunately, I don't think he does.



""How does it taste?"" I ask.



He makes a face. ""Gross.""



""Well,"" I said, glancing at the holder. ""It is recycled."" (The holder proudly said the napkins were made from recycled paper).



""Oh--"" His face lights up. ""That means I could be eating a tampon!""



I don't laugh, and I guess seeing I don't find it funny, he grabs the rest of the napkin, thankfully doesn't eat it, but starts folding it up. I ask what he's doing. He says he's making a joint. Another joke? He then tells me about having to be careful and hiding drugs from the police, and about this crazy (drug) trip he went on when he hid drugs up his butt.



Honestly, this last part is all a blur. I know the story involved butt drugs, kindergarteners, and demons. I looked at my phone and said I had to go, and that this was a very wide-ranging conversation. He agreed, and said,



""Until we meet again.""



Out of the corner of my eye I could see him watching me as I left. Nothing really strange, I guess, but I noticed.  



That's the last conversation I had with him. I stopped eating lunch and switched to breakfast, wanting to avoid the possibility of seeing him one on one again. That also resulted in me crossing paths with him less on campus. My RD recommended I fill out a student concern report, because she thought maybe he was acting out in response to his puppy's death.



Maybe. I'm not sure what to think.



I'm going to end this story with the disclaimer that I'm not trying to be mean. I understand that people struggle with social anxiety/in social situations, and that there are mental disabilities/disorders/illnesses that could cause/result in someone acting in ways others would/could find strange. I don't know for certain if he struggled with anything like that, but I would never cut off a friendship or even an acquaintanceship for those reasons alone. I did enjoy talking to him and brushed off behaviors that stuck out to me because they were harmless (namely referring to the abrupt changes in topic and the repeated offering to bring me food). In his defense, I didn't have to agree to the kiwis, to get dinner that one time, or to stay in that last conversation as long as I did. 

  

That said. It wasn't until the last interaction that I felt any need to distance myself, and I did so immediately.

I really, really struggle with sharing. I don’t like people touching my stuff. But it’s even deeper than that! I recently discovered a secret little new coffee place in my city and told one of my coworkers about it, and now a bunch of people from my work all go there. It hasn’t even made it busier for me, but it still feels like sharing and I hate it! I also hate it when I’m into something first, and someone else decides they like it too, and they tell other people. For example, I told someone about my favourite book, then she was posting on Instagram that it’s her new favourite too, and I was so mad! It felt like it was being “taken” from me or something. I almost wanted to jump up and say “But I liked it first! Credit me!” lol.

This is such a weird silly thing, but I really struggle with it emotionally. Can anyone relate?",4,1729236815.0,AutismInWomen,3,1.0,False

1g6cimp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1g6cimp/i_can_make_friends_one_on_one_but_struggle_in/,I can make friends one on one but struggle in group friendships…,"My whole life I have been fine at making friends one on one, but as soon as it’s the context of a friend group, I’ve struggled. Sometimes it’s because I haven’t had the same interest (ie I was briefly a part of group of playgroup mums who only ever caught up to drink coffee or party and neither was my scene), sometimes I’ve been part of a group of quieter girls that I introduced to one another but whenever I tried to organise get together, everyone was busy - however when someone else made plans, I was conveniently the only one unable to join. At high school I felt like the extra in the friend group - not in a sense that I was a tag along, I know my friends liked me (well outside of normal teen girl dramas) but within my friend group everyone had pairings and tighter friendships - I didn’t.

Even when I was in my 20s, I formed a really tight group of friends at work and we had such good fun on road trips and pub quizzes. Until one guy moved to a new town, and the group disassembled. I realised he was the “fun friend” who liked everyone and everyone liked, and HE was the “glue” who kept us together. Again - I introduced everyone. The whole time I thought I had “glued” the group, but it wasn’t the case. It was like I realised I was likeable but never the most likeable.

Every single friend group I’ve been a part of I’ve always felt were off and I’ve eventually stopped hanging out or talking to those people. But I still have good individual friends.

My husband is another story. He won’t admit it, but he’s the most popular and extroverted guy I know (for reference I’m an ambivert). He has TIGHT friend groups from way back to high school. University. All his sports codes, and every single workplace. He still is in touch with people from all of those groups and has occasional catch ups with them as a whole or one on one. The only exception has been his current workplace but that’s because he’s now the boss, so inevitably he can’t form friendships there.

He has always expected me to join in on his social circles. I love his friends and they love me. They always tell him he was punching when he got me (I felt that that wasn’t really a compliment to me but them teasing him). I’ve always felt respected by them and a part of them. But the truth is, I adopted them as friends so they’re not really friend groups I formed by being MYSELF. So I doubt myself and wonder if I’m not being authentic around them and that’s why they like me, or I wonder if my husband has great ability to attract decent people (they are of all ages and are mixed gender) and I’ve just been attracting the wrong crowds my whole life. 

I’ve only really been bothered about because my brother called me a “wallflower” today. The sort that people tolerate at get togethers but don’t always  remember to include. He meant it in solidarity because he’s the same but it has caused me to reflect and I’ve spiralled a bit. I’m a grown woman, why do I care?

I guess I’m not asking if there something I am doing wrong - am I too weird, too annoying, too negative, too something for these people - because no one here can really make that judgement without seeing it. And I have had experiences where I know I haven’t fitted in with a group. I’m referring more to the ones I thought I did fit in with. I just wonder if some people lack the “knack” to make friend groups like me? I know a girl who can go to a festival alone and walk out the most popular person of a clique that was already formed before she turned up. Am I just the opposite to that? Or is it that I’m just expecting myself to be Miss Popular when not everyone can hold that title?

In anycase… If you relate to this, what have you learned from your experiences or did you make changes to improve this?

1g6cibk,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1g6cibk/my_tips_on_how_to_run_a_good_shop/,My tips on how to run a good shop,"I've gotten to a point now, ever since adopting my Aristocrat mod centric build, where I've needed to rely on my store for better damage. Lately it's been the case that I keep needing to either activate another C.A.M.P. or go buy a ton of junk in bulk from vendors to avoid having people buy my stuff while I'm at max caps. It's not uncommon for players to be lurking or hanging around my shops for many half hours at a time so I consider myself as having an aptitude for this and just wanted to share some of the ways I run my camp shop. Partially because I see how some of you run yours, charging very asshole-ish prices.

1: I like to dedicate at least two entire camp builds centered around just being a shop, not spending much camp budget for beds and things like furniture for housing, and I find that the camps that look less like a home tend to work the best.

2: I position my shops around areas that players can fast travel to at little to no cost, such as outside of the Rusty Pick or around where nuclear drop events occur and already have a lot of players conglomerated around.

3: The most important thing I've done that really gave my shop the ability to always generate profit was learning the recipe for every single mutation and charging between 300 to 500 caps for them, never any higher.

4: I often do up my shops to include a dining area where purified waters, free plants, a jukebox, company tea/ground coffee is readily available and unlocked. Sometimes neon or blue lighting really sets a better scene and I always keep a scrapbox/ammo box/stash box next to where the vendors are so players can check their inventory against what I'm selling seamlessly.

5: I often utilize signage and neon letters to say business related jargon bullshit like ""0 money down"" or ""Bad credit? No credit? No problem"" to give my shops some levity.

6: I always keep something for sale in every categorical item tab so that when players are going through the vendor list on the map screen they see a dense inventory list. Every extra word counts and stimpaks show up independently from meds. From my personal experience, I'm always more curious to check out a store when it has a high ""Misc."" inventory for sale. My shops always do better when I'm selling legendary weapons and armor, even when they're of low quality, because it piques interest and a lot of people will buy your legendary items just to scrap them and maybe save a mod or turn them in for scrip.

7: More than selling the things that I loot, I actively construct items to place in my shop that might situationally apply to different players. Players at low levels would be more willing to buy a Radiation Suit you construct specifically to be level one. One item I can always charge thousands of caps for is Marine Underarmor because it counts as apparel and using stable flux you can mod them to grant greater SPECIAL stats and damage resist than any other simple clothing article, and it's non-invasive in that players can wear preferred outfits over them still. However, I also construct outfits just for aesthetics, and charge the same rate across the board for all headgear and costumes. These are easy to construct and not everyone has the plans to make them.

8: I almost always sell plans I've already read at a discounted and easily reachable price, save for very rare ones which I mark up in accordance to how rare they are relative to how fast I learned them as I leveled up.

9: I sell scrapped junk, never in bulk, in accordance to how much surplus material I have of the junk and how much I personally use the junk. I construct a lot of grenades, so I make sure to charge 3 caps per waste oil, but bone shards are very easy to get and I rarely use them so I charge only 1 because I figure whoever is buying them probably has a very niche need for it in-the-now, like constructing a specific piece of camp furniture. People will spend a lot of money on Hardened Masses, Glowing Masses, and High Radiation fluids because they're necessary to stabilize raw flux, but you can't get too greedy. I always charge 76 caps for them. 

10: If something is freely available as a generating resource in your camp, like with the boiled water machine, it makes you look like a dick to charge for them and players broadly appreciate when you put them into your store at zero cost. I usually only do this when I have too much of something non-perishable.

11: Selling things people require for cooking specific dishes like cream, sugar, and salt will generally get you more money than selling beer or sugar bombs. You should also sell beer very cheaply, completely unlike the kinds of pricing you'd find beer at in real life. I sell a lot of Nuka-Twist and Nuka-Wild at 18 caps and 13 caps respectively, and I collect them free at my Nukatron Collectron Station I keep locked at every camp. Players will have a specific interest in paying heavy for Nuka Cola Quantums and Nuka Cola if they run a grenade build, because they're necessary to make the two strongest grenades.

12: I sell any duplicate items of clothing I produce one article at a time, because for some reason you can't stack White Wolf Fedoras and they take up a whole slot individually in your store.

13: Niche drugs like Daddy-O or Calmex can be sold at a premium above the standard price the game would have you sell them at, but these are not so rare that players would shell much money out for them. Don't ever charge more than 100 caps for these.

14: You can upsell bobby pins if you carry them in bulk, players generally don't mind paying a little more than they're worth in a store if they can get many at once, but keep in mind that most players hurting for bobby pins are likely low level and won't have a ton of caps to spare for them.

15: There are only a few 1-2 star mods you can sell for many thousands of caps at a time. Most people don't give a fuck about Exterminators, Troubleshooters, or Junkie mods so they must be sold in the hundreds range of caps-not thousands. The Bloodied mod can sell for extremely high amounts because it's very high in demand but generally you want to stick to very specific mods like Furious, Juggernaut, and Mutated if you want to sell mods between 2 to 8 thousand caps at a time. You can charge as much as 15 thousand caps for many 3 star mods such as VATS Enhanced or Strength, but be wary because too many of these sold at once will result in redundancy once you reach max caps.

16: People do not give a shit about radaway, stimpacks, rad-X , or stealth boys so don't let them take that much weight in your inventory when including them. Remember that most players at high levels can heal themselves with an autodoc at their base, so charge very low amounts for Disease Cure and Addictol because these are items only low level and broke players are likely feening for.

17: Gamma gun ammo is hard to come by, so you can charge as much as 2 to 3 caps per, but no one will pay more than 1 cap for most forms of ammunition like shotgun shells. Fusion Cores should only be sold if they're fully charged, and at less than 100 caps because a lot of players would rather just take over a power plant and farm them than break the bank over fusion cores. Plasma cores on the other hand, while harder to come by, often aren't used widely enough to justify charging much more for them than fusion cores. 

18: Missiles and mini nukes weigh too much to be worth carrying them in your store, and if you sell them they need to be eminently affordable or else they will be dead weight.

19: I always charge at least twice as much for Ultracite ammunition, but because these are less frequently used they'll often take longer to offload and are not worth creating just to sell.

20: Nuclear keycards can sell for as much as 1,000 caps or over, but I wouldn't part with any unless they were taking up legitimately too much weight in my stash. You make more money using them and completing the events that follow.

21: Players would rather use crafting benches at their own camps, it's rare I ever would see someone using crafting benches I'd leave near a vendor. I leave a Tinkerers Workbench around my shops at minimum so non-Fallout 1st players can scrap their items nearby it though.

That's all I can think of right now, happy gaming.",1,1729236557.0,fo76,5,0.99,False

Hey there,

I’m a 42-year-old INFP from Nevada looking to connect with people who enjoy diving deep into conversations beyond small talk. If you value authenticity, introspection, and a good music recommendation, we might get along!

About Me:

Emotions are important to me—empathy, honesty, and real talk are my thing. I appreciate conversations where both sides feel understood.

Music is my life’s soundtrack—I'm into everything from In Flames and Blink-182 to Breathe Carolina, Our Last Night, and lately, I’ve been listening to a lot of The Anix. Lyrics are the subtitles to my experiences.

I enjoy deep conversations about life and what makes people tick.

I love shows and movies with dark humor and intensity, like Loudermilk, Evil, and Shaun of the Dead. I also enjoy reading about and watching videos on the paranormal.

I’m fascinated by psychology and human behavior, always seeking new insights.

Nature provides moments of peace and reflection, even if I don’t get outdoors often.

Team Pepsi (Dr Pepper’s my favorite), I love tea, hardly drink coffee, I’m team Star Trek, neither Democrat nor Republican, and I prefer Twizzlers over Red Vines. Now we’ve covered potential disagreements!

I tend to get along best with other INFPs and INFJs.

I don't care about age so if you jam, bring the peanut butter, and I’ll bring the bread—let’s see if we can make something great together!

Do I miss the morning brew or do I suffer any withdrawal symptoms? Absolutely not. This time, I believe my addiction is psychological. Let me clear my story a little. 

  
In late November 2021, I decided to quit caffeine. In 2022, I only had 10% of my normal intake of caffeinated beverages. In 2023, I did not touch caffeine, in any shape or form. 

  
Now, in 2024, I had some relapses. The last one took three weeks of drinking coffee and energy drinks daily. And I believe that my addiction right now is merely psychological.

Considering that land is not an issue, what are some detriments/problems that would be faced. I would also like to use innovative/sustainable models that would benefit the coffee farmers as well as how these farms operate for the environment.

First of all, let me start by giving some context.

I am 22F and studying in a university. I am actually fairly confident and I respect boundaries and personal space, especially since I am someone who likes her personal space and hanging out alone. Whatever, so I feel like I wouldn't make things weird if talked with someone with flirtatious and will know when to stop. Actually I also had dates where I met people like that (by like that I mean not on apps but at school), but they were like either that person approached me, or I apprpached someone but in a gathering of the LGBTQ+ students club.

So, as I said. I am confident about my communication skills. And there's that person that I saw few times at school, and they pinged my gaydar. However, we don't take common classes and both they and I are not regulars in LGBTQ+ club meetings, so I see them only in cafes in school. I would really love to go and compliment their hair and style and ask if they'd like to have a coffee or give me their socials, HOWEVER, I start overthinking.

What happens is, I start questioning if they are open to such a thing, maybe they does not want to be disturbed, right? Then I say to myself ""well, they can then that they don't want to, or imply by their mimics and I'll understand"". Then I think maybe they don't want to flirt, then I say to myself ""well, then we can be friends or we may not be anything, better than not trying at all?"".

So I have this inner conversation where I am trying to convince myself to go and talk to them and while this is happening they left the cafe... I want to try my luck next time but I want to hear your opinions about both:
- is what I want to do is completely OK. like I am just so concerned about personal space and I just don't want to make this person feel bad
- if that's OK, how do I approach? like I was thinking about complimenting their hair and style and asking if they'd like to hang out / or share their socials but this is way to go right?

1g6c69n,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g6c69n/the_whisper_field_part_2/,The Whisper Field (Part 2),"[Since last I wrote on the subject of the whisper field](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g5kjje/the_whisper_field/) ... I was able to meet up with my professor. It was a strikingly cold, windy, and overcast day in Southern California, perfect mood for acquiring materials of a sensitive nature. Street cats roaming under oak trees and misting rain up in the hills. Of course, then my professor had on a Hawaiian shirt and pink glasses.

Perhaps it's best I don't reveal his name so I'll just call him Professor S. We sometimes get together for lunch to chat and recently discussed the issues with the OceanGate Titan sub that led to its catastrophic failure. No, that incident wasn't related to the whisper field. Just plain old greed and negligence. But it's a different matter with this diving expedition earlier in 2024. With OceanGate, a transcript entirely written by some random person online seemed far more legitimate than what was ultimately revealed to the public. 

Now I can't be completely certain that the following transcript is 100% genuine but Professor S checked it with several people he knows in the deep-sea exploration industry and it passes the smell test.

**Transcript of Radio Communication Between Topside Base and Submarine Fathom-6, Mariana Trench Expedition**

[July 14, 2024]
Mission: Deep Dive Exploration, Mariana Trench (10,994 meters)
Participants: Fathom-6 Submersible (Commander Riley and Engineer Samuels)
Topside Operations (Control Tech Alvarez)

[Some irrelevant convos and technical data omitted. Time stamps not included].

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fathom-6, this is Topside. You're clear for descent. Confirm status check. And hey, don’t go pulling a James Cameron on us, okay? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Ha! Roger that, Topside. We'll try not to bring back Titanic Two. Systems are green across the board. Depth gauge is calibrated, oxygen steady, Samuels is whining about the coffee already and asking when he can take a nap. He's so lazy. Over.

[Time passes before reply]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Wow. Harsh. Maybe I’ll pass that on to the catering team. I’m sure they'll cry themselves to sleep. Anyway, telemetry looks good on our end. Keep an eye on the lateral thrusters. Last check showed them a little sluggish. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Yeah, we’ll keep an eye out. Thrusters are holding for now. Descending to 1,500 meters. Visibility is decent. Not much to see yet, just endless blue.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Endless blue, that’s sooo poetic. You been reading up on your Jacques Cousteau? Wait till we get to the black. It’s gonna feel like we’re diving into space. But wet. Over.

[25 minutes later]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
You're at 4,000 meters, Fathom-6. All systems nominal. How’s the view? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Pretty spectacular, actually. We just passed a big old squid giving us the side-eye. Probably pissed we didn’t invite him for lunch. We’re at 4,100 now and dropping smoothly.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
And no icebergs. That’s a win. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Good to know! Would hate for you to miss the James Cameron Seal of Approval. You're past Titanic depth now. No sign of any luxury liners down there? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Nah. But I’ll keep an eye out for a Game Boy some kid lost over the side of their cruise ship in the 90s. Probably would still work. Did Cameron leave any of his cameras behind on DCV 1? Might be a nice find.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Probably. That guy leaves cameras everywhere he goes. Cameron makes all this look easy. The guy’s probably sipping lattes at 10,900 meters deep, while we’re in here trying not to kill each other in a cramped tin can. Anyway, lateral thrusters are getting a bit slow, just like you said. I’m gonna re-calibrate them before we hit the next depth window. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Roger that. Thruster data’s coming through. Do what you need to. And hey, don’t pull an OceanGate down there. I like you guys intact. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Too soon, Alvarez. Too soon.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Yeah, can we not talk about sub implosions while we’re heading into the deepest hole on the planet? Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
My bad. We’ll stick to safe topics. Like my ex. Since we're talking about deep holes. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Trying too hard, Topside. But levity appreciated.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Descent speed nominal. Pressure is at the expected range. We’re at 5000 meters. Looks good so far. If we have a problem, we still have our floaty bois. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Floaty bois? Is that the official technical term? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Oh, absolutely. It’s in the manual right after ""don't panic.""

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Alright, passing 6,500 meters. The ballast is steady. Thrusters online, no other issues. External temp is dropping faster than my enthusiasm for this brand of jokes. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fine and fair enough. All systems still looking good topside. You’re entering the “hadal zone.” Named after Hades. Tell him I said hi. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Just waiting for a Cthulhu sighting at this point. Samuels, you see any tentacles on your end yet?

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Not yet, but I’ll let you know if something taps the window. Over. 

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Careful what you wish for. Let’s stay focused here. How’s the oxygen scrubbers? Pressure still good? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
All systems normal. Scrubbers functioning. Pressure’s holding. But we did get a minor ping—wait, no, never mind. False alarm. Just the sonar being twitchy. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Copy that. Keep an eye on the readings. We’re showing some static on the comms from our end. Could be the pressure messing with the signal. You two hearing anything weird? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Nah, clear on our side. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
How’s the pressure inside? No pops or cracks, right? Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Not unless you count my neck popping from having no room to stretch up or move around. Everything looks solid here.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
I still think we should’ve brought a movie to kill time. Maybe The Abyss. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
The Abyss? Really? Pretty sure that's the last thing you want to watch. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Hey, it's also a really sweet love story. Between a man and an alien in a jellyfish suit. 
Maybe we could've done a Titanic rewatch. That way, at least we’d be inspired not to crash.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
I could do without the movie marathon talk. Pressure’s spiking but within tolerances. Ballast’s holding. Can’t say the same about my anxiety. Over. 

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Copy. You’re almost at the bottom floor. Check your exterior cameras. Sonar’s reading some activity a couple of clicks ahead. Might be worth a look. Over. 

[Static on the comms for 30 seconds]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fathom-6, this is Topside. Do you copy? Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Yeah, we copy. Just a bit of interference. Cameras aren’t picking up much. Just the usual—wait. Something’s moving. Probably just a jelly or—hold on, that’s… weird...

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Weird how? Describe what you’re seeing. Remember to end messages. Over. 

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Right. Ummm...it's like… a shadow, but it’s not moving with the current. It’s staying still...

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Could be a sonar anomaly? Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Keep an eye on it but don’t get too close. What’s your depth now? Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
7000 meters. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Good, stay cautious. Could be debris or… I don’t know, we’ve seen all sorts of strange things down there. Descend to 8,000 meters. You’ll be in the Trench proper by then. Let us know if things start getting spookier. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Define spookier. We talking a spectral dance party showing up? Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
You’ll know it. Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Really not comforting, Topside. But will keep ears out. Over. 

[45 minutes later]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fathom-6, you’re at 9,500 meters. All systems green. You guys are doing great. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Thanks, Topside. Visibility’s near zero now. Feels like we’re diving through ink. Pressure’s heavy, creaks, but everything’s holding steady. No issues so far. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Creaks? Elaborate. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Like... I thought I heard you, Alvarez, but weirdly distant. Some kind of feedback maybe? Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Wasn’t me. Maybe it’s interference from the pressure or—wait, hang on. Over.

[Static again, this time lasting longer]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Okay, Fathom-6, this is Topside. You cut out for a bit there. What’s going on? Over. 

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Just the sound of us creaking a little. Every time we dip lower, I feel like I’m in an old submarine movie....You hear that?---

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
...What?---

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
That… I dunno—sounded like static, or—

[Alvarez (Topside)]
You guys are cutting out a little, Fathom-6? I didn’t catch that last part. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Nah, just hearing things. Probably the sound of our nerves snapping. Or just Samuels' nerves. I'm cool as a sea cucumber.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Ha ha, very funny. No, I swear I heard something in the static just now. Thought it was you messing with the comms, Alvarez. Tell me you aren't playing with us or actually tell us, yes, you're just having some fun. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Not me. Comm systems are clear. You sure it wasn’t just interference? Happens sometimes at these depths. Over.

[10 minutes later]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fathom-6, you’ve hit 10,500 meters. Welcome to the bottom of the world. Any strange creatures or Cthulhu sightings? Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Nothing yet, though I keep waiting for something to tap on the window. Or for Samuels to crack and start screaming about giant crabs.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Hey, I like crabs. But there is something weird down here. There’s a… hum. I can’t explain it. It’s not mechanical, but it’s too consistent to be natural. Alvarez, are you picking up any weird frequencies? Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Negative. Everything’s reading fine on our end. No weird frequencies. You might just be hearing ambient ocean noise. It’s not like we’ve mapped everything down there. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Yeah, Samuels, quit being paranoid. Unless the hum is singing you a lullaby, I think we’re good.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Sure, make jokes. But it’s weird. I swear it’s getting louder, almost like—

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Hold up. I’m actually picking up something now. There’s a faint signal coming through. Did you guys try to transmit something extra? I’ve got some garbled audio coming in on a different band. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
No, we haven’t transmitted anything since the last check-in. What’s the audio saying? Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
I don’t know. It’s just static… and maybe voices? It’s too distorted. Hang on. Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Voices? Riley, I’m telling you, something’s off down here. It’s like… it’s like I can hear someone whispering. Thought it was you a minute ago, but—

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Not me, Samuels. You’re hearing things. The pressure’s probably messing with your head. We’re sitting in colon butt crack of the world, after all.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fathom-6, I’m still picking up that audio. It’s definitely whispering, but I can’t make out the words. Can you guys confirm there’s nothing on your end? You’re not hearing this? Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
I am hearing something. It’s faint, but it sounds like… someone’s talking. Like right outside the hull.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Samuels, that’s not possible. We’re at 10,500 meters. You’re imagining things. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
I don’t know, Riley. I’m hearing it too now. And it’s not interference. Over. 

[3 minutes of silence on the comms]

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Alvarez, are you messing with us? I swear I just heard my own name. And it wasn’t lovingly whispered by Samuels. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Negative, Riley. No tricks. I wouldn’t be that cruel. But if you’re hearing something down there, I need you to stay calm and check your systems. It’s possible the acoustics are playing tricks at that depth. Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
I… I don’t think this is acoustics. I’m hearing something clearer now. It’s not just a hum. It’s voices. One of them… it sounded like my dad. But my dad’s been gone for 10 years. Fuck...

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Alvarez. We're not joking down here. For once. I’m serious. I heard my own voice. My name. It wasn’t an echo. It was… it was too clear, like someone whispered right into my ear. Over.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Both of you, hold it together. There’s no way any of this is real. Stress and pressure can do a lot of things to your minds, especially at these depths. You’re hearing what you expect to hear. I've heard some weird things too but that's normal. Just take a deep breath and chill. Over.

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
No, no, no. This is different. It’s not in my head anymore. It’s like it’s inside the sub. It's whispering things I haven’t told anyone. Stuff about my family. About things I’ve done… Alvarez, it’s inside! How could it be inside? Why is it inside?

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Jesus, Samuels, get a grip. Don’t lose it on me down here. I’m hearing things too. It's like… it knows stuff. Things I would never talk about to anyone. Not even my therapist. I don't wanna sound crazy, but there's something here...

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
It’s getting louder, Riley. I hear it. I hear so much. I hear all of it. It’s like it’s talking right into my head. It’s repeating stuff I thought I forgot. Oh god… Alvarez… it knows. It’s knows everything about me...

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Guys, stay with me. You both need to focus. I need you to prep for immediate but controlled ascent. Whatever you’re experiencing, we’re getting you out of there. Now. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Ballast’s not responding, Alvarez. I’m trying, but it’s like the whole system is locked. We’re stuck...

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Oh God, Riley. It’s inside me. I can hear it in me now. I can hear it repeating all the horrible things I think about it and I never tell anyone… every thought I’ve buried. It won’t stop! It won’t stop!

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Samuels, hold it together! We’re getting out. Alvarez, systems aren’t responding at all. I need a manual override. I don’t know what the hell’s happening, but it’s not just whispers anymore. The sub… the sub is vibrating. I can feel it. It’s like something’s touching the hull, trying to split it open like an egg...

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Fathom-6, calm down! I’m sending the override codes now. You’re going to be fine. Just hang on. Over.

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
No, you don’t get it, Alvarez. The voices… they’re talking about things that no one could know. I've hurt people. It was a long time ago but I've done some bad things. Things I’ve locked away. How the hell is this possible? It’s saying… it’s saying my wife’s name. How do you know her name?!

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
Oh god. It’s screaming! It’s screaming in my head! Make it stop, make it stop! It knows everything! It’s pulling my thoughts out—It’s pulling them out! Riley, help me!

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Samuels, hold on! Alvarez, we need that override! It’s like the whole sub is alive down here! It’s crawling, like there’s something trying to get inside.

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Override sent! You’re going to be fine, just focus on the systems. We’re pulling you out. Hang in there. Over.

[Static crackles, mixed with unintelligible whispers.]

[Samuels (Fathom-6)]
IT’S INSIDE ME! I CAN’T— AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
Samuels! SAMUELS! Jesus, Alvarez, he’s… I can’t… Oh god!

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Riley, respond! What’s happening? Do you copy? Fathom-6, do you copy?!

[Silence. Then whispers. Louder and clearer.]

[Whispers (unknown source)]
…know. Down here. Fear. All here. In the dark...

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Riley! Samuels! Pull up! Pull up now!

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
It’s too late. We’re not alone down here. I can’t—I can’t fight it. They know. They know. Oh god. Alvarez, I’m sorry.

[Whispers grow louder, overlapping.]

[Riley (Fathom-6)]
[Screaming] No! No! It’s in me! 

[The sound of a human skull banging against a submarine wall]

[Alvarez (Topside)]
Riley! SAMUELS! PULL UP! PULL UP NOW!

[All comms abruptly cut. Final transmission lost]

Aside from this discovery, I was able to use a YouTube video recovery app to find a three part series which has since recently been deleted soon after posting, still in the Google cache. Unfortunately, I don't have the original video files, just an AI transcription of the materials which I am proofing and correcting.

Excitingly, one of the survivors of the 1965 to 1967 British Geological Society Tesla Experiments has responded to my emails and is willing to conduct a sitdown interview since they live in the area.

I haven't been sleeping lately, but that isn't a new thing for me. The new thing is that I hear sounds outside the front door of where I live, usually past 1 AM. It could be the changing temperature or stealthy cats camping out on the patio furniture but every time I've checked there is nothing and no one there. The whispers are constant to the point that I'm starting to consider them just white noise. I play a lot of heavy music to deal with it, but it never quite seems to overcome them.

Would it be so bad to just stick my Phillips head screwdriver deep enough and feel some blessed silence? But what if they're still there, even after?",1,1729234980.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Up until our fourth was born I had been working hybrid and was home some during the day most days. I now have a more traditional work schedule and am gone, at a minimum, from 7:30am until 5:00pm M-Fr. My wife is exhausted. I am currently doing the following: wake up early, get myself ready for work, put away clean dishes, fill kids water cups (yeti ramblers for kids are legit. 4 years plus so far), make breakfast (typically oatmeal) for the kids and mom, make coffee, get the kids up, brush their teeth, serve breakfast, and take out the trash on the way out when I leave for work. When I get home I take over managing the big 3 including finishing dinner, cleaning up, play time, showers, brushing teeth, brushing hair, etc. getting in jammies, and putting them to bed, usually by 8. I then clean the dinner table, clean up dirty dishes and the kitchen in general, load the dishwasher and pick up around the living room, dining room, and kitchen areas. This usually gets me to around 9:00-9:30pm if I haven’t stopped to check a game score or take an extended poop sesh. This is my daily routine. I’m not always perfect but I literally have these as checklist items in our calendar app and I do most of it every day, and all of it most days. It still doesn’t feel like enough because she is struggling. We have the 2 month old and between breast feeding and the nap schedule she doesn’t even get to spend meaningful time with the others most days. Our two oldest are doing homeschool and they are brilliant kids, but my wife feels like she/they are falling behind schedule. I can’t stop working and so far she has refused the offer of help from either a cleaner or nanny every time I bring it up. I feel somehow responsible and I don’t know what to do. She is exhausted and is having negative interactions with the kids daily. She is sleeping with the baby in our room as we have agreed this is the last one, and she says she wants all the cuddles she can get. I have offered to help at night more, but she says one of us needs to get sleep every time. I know I can push to be of more use then but I’m afraid that will also lead to worse output from me in the morning which is a bigger threat in my opinion based on experience. Thanks for listening and any words of wisdom. ",1,1729234974.0,sahm,0,1.0,False

Arguments abound over whether marijuana should be legalized. Many of these arguments pertain to the lengthy federal guidelines for prison sentences meted out for what is considered a relatively petty crime. Others point out that marijuana is a drug that could, and should, be used for medicinal purposes. But most proponents of legalization ignore the mounting evidence which points to the long term damage to the user and for society as a whole.

In the Netherlands, marijuana has been legally available since 1976. ""Coffee shops"" sell cannabis over the counter in many parts of the  country. However, more people have tried cannabis since it has been legalized.

Medical research has repeatedly provided evidence that marijuana use causes permanent physical, psychological, and thus emotional damage to those who regularly use it. Studies at the University of Maryland and UCLA indicated that the regular smoking of only two marijuana cigarettes a day would tend to promote toe fungus and thrush. But over the years, much stronger claims have surfaced: heavy marijuana users perform poorly at work or school, are more likely to be delinquent and develop psychiatric problems, or have abnormal brain waves. Repeatedly, however, such studies encounter the same objection: are the problems caused by smoking marijuana, or is it just that people with problems are more likely to end up using marijuana heavily?

Marijuana is addictive. According to Wayne Hall, director of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of New South Wales,  Sydney, cannabis is not generally regarded as a drug of dependence because it does not have a clearly defined withdrawal syndrome. But that, he says, is an old-fashioned definition of addiction.

Research into marijuana's use as a medicine has proven either Inconclusive or tended to show that its side effects rendered cannabis unsuitable as a drug. For instance, one study surveyed the use of cannabinoids to combat nausea following chemotherapy. While the tablets or injections were slightly more effective than standard treatments, their side effects, plus the recent development of new, more powerful drugs, makes them a poor choice for nausea rellef. In her study, ""Cannabinoids were no more effective than codeine in controlling acute and chronic pain and they had undesirable effects in depressing the central nervous system, comments Eija Kalso of Helsinki University Hospital. Yet, under mounting pressure, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has reluctantly agreed to provide funds for once again testing the efficacy of marijuana as a medicine.


1. According to the passage, all of the following are harmful effects of marijuana EXCEPT:

A). poor performance at work

B). development of psychiatric problems 

C). growth of toe fungus and thrush

D). depression and memory loss

E). Abnormal brain waves

2. According to an earlier definition, why is marijuana not considered addictive?

A). Its use does not result in death

B). Lack of dearly defined withdrawal syndrome

C). It has several beneficial uses

D). Its harmful effects have not been proved

E). Its use is legal in a lot of countries

3. Which of the following can be inferred from the information in the passage?

A). It has now been proved without a doubt that marijuana Is indeed harmful to humans

B). Marijuana has been unreasonably criticized by doctors 

C). Netherland will soon make marijuana illegal

D). Marijuana has several harmful effects and probably some beneficial ones as well

E). The US Drug enforcement Agency has decided to ban the use of marijuana",1,1729234944.0,IPMATexam,0,1.0,False

### Open Floor Plans for Airy Spaces

Embrace the beauty of open floor plans. This layout enhances the feeling of space and allows natural light to flood the interiors. With fewer walls, you create a seamless transition from the living room to the kitchen and dining area. This approach is especially effective in small beach houses, maximizing every inch.

- **Living Area:** Use light, airy colors for walls and furniture to promote a tranquil vibe.
- **Kitchen:** Incorporate a small island that doubles as a dining table for functional use.
- **Outdoor Transition:** Large sliding doors can connect your living space to a deck or patio, blurring the line between the indoors and outdoors.

### Eco-Friendly Features

Eco-friendly elements can enhance the charm of small beach house designs while being kind to the environment. From energy-efficient windows to sustainable materials, consider implementing the following:

- **Rainwater Harvesting:** Install a system that collects rainwater for irrigation or other non-potable uses.

- **Foldable Tables:** Ideal for dining or working, these can be tucked away when not in use.
- **Storage Ottomans:** Useful for extra seating while providing hidden storage for beach gear and towels.
- **Bunk Beds:** Perfect for hosting guests and saving floor space; they offer a fun sleeping arrangement.

### Color Palette and Materials

Choosing the right colors and materials can make a small beach house feel inviting and relaxed. Light colors often reflect the coastal vibe.

- **Colors:** Soft blues, sandy beiges, and crisp whites mimic the natural seaside landscape.
- **Materials:** Use materials that blend with the coastal environment, such as wood, fiberglass, and stone.

Maximizing Space and Comfort in Tiny Beach Retreats
---------------------------------------------------

Creating a tiny beach retreat is a great way to enjoy the sun, sand, and surf without the burden of maintaining a large home. However, maximizing space and comfort in your beach house design can be a challenge. Here are some effective strategies to help you make the most out of your small beach house.

### Embrace Open Floor Plans

- **Strategic placement of windows:** Large or multiple windows can bring in natural light, making your space feel larger and more inviting.

### Incorporate Smart Storage Solutions

In a small beach house, every square inch counts, so it's important to include smart storage solutions throughout your designs:

- **Under-bed storage:** Utilize the space beneath your bed to add drawers or bins to keep your belongings organized.
- **Utilize walls:** Install shelves or cubbies on the walls to remove clutter from floors and maintain a clean look.
- **Multi-functional furniture:** Use ottomans, benches, or sofas that have storage compartments.

### Use Light Colors and Textures

- **Build a deck:** A simple wooden deck can serve as a terrific spot for your morning coffee or evening meals while enjoying ocean views.

Sleeping quarters in a small beach house need to feel cozy and relaxing. Here are suggestions to make them inviting:

- **Use cozy textiles:** Soft bedding and layered textures can make a small space feel more luxurious and warm.
- **Incorporate natural light:** Ensure that your sleeping area has adequate windows to promote natural light, making the space feel more open.

(Let’s call her Leslie) Hear me out — it was my birthday. Our friend group decided to take me out for dinner. I have a particular friend in the group (let’s call him Leo) that had a crush on her. Leslie wasn’t into Leo. (according to her). On the day of my birthday i noticed that they hardly talked to me all night. They were on the side lines flirting and not talking to anyone else in the friend group. I tried not to get confrontational because i had other friends present. 

After this - 2 of my friends were drunk. We all went back to my place & Leslie had told me she would take care of me and if necessary anyone else that got drunk. Instead, i ended up holding my friends head over the toilet for a few hours because Leslie decided to run off with Leo. When they came back they brought me food and basically said i should be grateful bcus i had asked for food when all along only one of them should’ve gone. Atp, i’m on the floor with my friend holding their head. Leslie goes up to my room and falls asleep. Doesn’t ask me if i need anything or if she should help with anything. Mind you, she had offered to take care of me on my birthday and made me feel i wouldn’t have to worry about anything.. instead i spent my birthday with vomit on my clothes and wiping it off of my other friend. 

Next morning she woke up early to get coffee with Leo before anyone else woke up. When i realized this i texted the friend group chat bcus of how upset i was about this sneaky behavior. It had been years of her being a self centered friend and i put up with it because i loved her and truly cared for her. I thought for once, that on my birthday, she would do something nice but it backfired. She made everyone think that im crazy and that i was at fault for everything and that i’m the bad friend. 

Fast forward … i got engaged last month. Leslie told my friend that she misses me and that we always talked about being each others bridesmaid and being there for these important moments.

1g6bul1,https://www.reddit.com/r/U2Band/comments/1g6bul1/song_of_the_week_hawmoon_269/,Song of the Week - Hawmoon 269,"[Hawkmoon 269](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1MrZ-BMhik&pp=ygUMaGF3a21vb24gMjY5) is a song from the Rattle and Hum album. Packed with powerful drums and vocals, interesting and striking guitar sounds, and a nice organ part (most obvious in the opening motif, which reminds me of a carnival) courtesy of Bob Dylan. The musicality of the song, from the powerful distortion tones from the Edge’s guitar to the rhythm sections ability to drive the intensity is fitting to the lyrical themes and the album’s focuses. A highlight for me is at 3:21, where the song sort of quiets down before at 3:30 explidng again into repetition and passionate, almost screaming, vocals.

The name of the track has some ambiguity which has been discussed by the band. The Hawkmoon part has been separately claimed by Bono as a tribute to Sam Shepard’s book “Hawk Moon” and the Edge as a reference to a place in rapid City North Dakota, “is a place in Rapid City, Dakota. We passed it on The Conspiracy of Hope tour. **The 269 comes from the number of mixes**. We spent three weeks on that track.” (U2 by U2). Bono says of the recording, “'Hawkmoon 269' was recorded in Sunset Sound, with all that shit that happens around there going on. Search-and-destroy choppers looking for drug busts. Sunset Strip, hookers. Every neon sign advertising sex in some shape or form. You could feel all that coming through in 'Hawkmoon'.” (U2 by U2) Personally, I like to believe Edge’s idea, the thought of the band just randomly coming across the word “hawkmoon” and being like, “yeah, lets write a song around that word.” Is so amusing and great to me. I love the way Bono says “hawkmoon” in the track (though only once).

The song hasn’t been played on tour since the Lovetown tour, where it was rarely in the set. There is, however, a great live recording available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35h1BhD5DkI). This version is a bit shorter, and really expands on some of the sounds Edge was playing with on the studio version.

Lyrically, the song is fairly straightforward in its writing-structure, but thematically complex. It basically takes all these things which lie in an apparent or real dependence relationship and compares them (in simile) to Bono’s need for “your love” (some of the examples such as “like sunlight” are more open-ended and not compared to a specific thing except for the desire for love directly). Thematically, the lyrics lean into the “American West” theme of the album, and some of the themes evoked in other songs like *Desire*. This colors many of the examples, starting with “like a desert needs the rain”. This also is a factual statement with no irony or evocation “agreeable taste”.

Overall, the main thing to point out is that the similes are either

1.)    Plainly of the nature described above (straightforwardly factual, natural, and relating to a greater scope and obvious necessity than love is typically granted):

·       “Like a desert needs rain”

·       “Like sunlight”

·       “Like heat needs the sun”

·       “Like thunder needs rain”

·       “Like oxygen”

·       “Like powder needs a spark” (if it is gunpowder, it would fit more into the darkly ironic section, but it could also be related to explosives used in other ways, such as fireworks).

2.)    Darkly ironic, in that they evoke things that do plausibly lie in a dependence relationship but are not “good” or “natural”.

·       Like a drifter needs a room

·       “Like nicotine”

·       Like the sweet revenge Of a bitter enemy

·       “Like the muzzle of a gun”

·       “Like a needle needs a vein”

·       “Like a runaway train”

·       “Like someone to blame”

·       “Like lies need the dark”

3.)    Relating to good/agreeable taste, things that are widely agreed upon as good, but might actually be considered “less grand” in terms of scale then love.

·       “Like a rhythm unbroken”

·       “Like drums in the night”

·       “Like sweet soul music”

·       “Like black coffee”

·       “Like honey on her tongue”

·       “Like a sweet stain” (this line, calling a stain “sweet”, lies in itself as a sort of synthesis of different categories)

4.)    Relating to religious themes. These tie-in to Bono’s habit of connecting romantic love to spirituality and the love of God. These lines suggest that love, like religious longing, is not only “necessary” but connected to suffering, uncertainty, and religious passion—reflecting the Chrisitan ideal of redemptive suffering in love.

·       “Like a Phoenix rising needs a holy tree”

·       “Like a preacher needs pain”

·       Like tongues of flame (this line evokes the Holy Spirit rising at Pentecost in the Bible Acts 2:3 and likely the tradition popular in some American southern churches of “speaking in tongues” as a sign of the Holy Spirit.)

·       Like faith needs a doubt

The repetitive nature of the “I need your love” (which appears at least 40 times) reflects an obsessive desire for love of this person, and the similes suggest that this yearning is necessary and a deep part of the human-condition. We are left wondering, with the different themes, whether the desire is “good” (“like honey on the tongue”/”like a rhythm unbroken” or “bad” (“like sweet revenge”/”like the muzzle of a gun”. His obsession is powerful, overwhelming, and all-consuming—it’s not just love in the typically construed sense, but something complex that could be both life-affirming and destructive. It is both beautiful and fraught with tension, something that could be desired yet feared. Rather than explaining this directly, we are just left with the statement of passionate desire, “I need your love”, the connecting but, in some sense, unresolvedly paradoxical, necessary, similaic comparisons, and the outro repeating, **“In the heat of love in the heart”.**

I am a 32 year old seeking connections close by or online; whatever the universe brings along at this point. I am not seeking serious relationships, but I am not entirely against it if someday it flourishes.

About me: I work two jobs and I’m studying psychology although I am pausing it due to some life changes. I may be changing majors once I finish my associates though. I have a cat, and enjoy reading, writing, cooking, making art and getting into whatever hypefixation that’s next in line. I am diagnosed with ADHD, so my hobbies do change here and there when I have the time. I also am a system in regards with OSDD/DID. You can ask about that if you wish.

I am in my Victorian/velvet goth era but I am masc appearing with some cutesy undertones. I consider myself androgynous but I am born female. I love black and has always been my hyperfixations. Everything in my apartment is black (except the walls cause I’m not spending that kind of money only to undo it for whenever I leave). I've had this fixation since I was a kid and even to this day, I am very picky about how black everything must be.

I reside in LA. I like to go out when I can and plan for in advance. I enjoy going out and meeting people and getting coffee which I absolutely love. Sometimes I’ll hit the bars for some drinks. I am poly/ENM but I am single and prefer to be single at my pace as I get to know more people. I am not monogamous and that will not change. 

I am heavily into kink for hedonistic adventures, and I just can’t do vanilla. But that stuff takes time for me to get into with someone. Trust and the vetting process is important to me as a top. I also want to explore cuddling and kissing more with friends or whatever and just be free. I am breaking away from societal and religious constraints that have made me live a life of guilt and feeling terrible about myself, my body and my desires. I just have so much love and care to give but even that does have its constraints as I am careful not to be taken advantage of again. 

I’m 5’5”, a bit on the thicc daddy side but I’ve been losing weight due to health reasons and for health purposes (I follow a keto diet most times but allow myself a treat), I have dark brown hair past my shoulders a bit (used to have butt length hair but had to cut it). I’ve dyed it black a few times but it never lasts long. I have semi fair skin and freckles, and I can share selfies if needed. Maybe exchange IG handles? Aside from that, I do want to explore new places with new people especially restaurants. I’m a foodie (but with some dietary restrictions). Let me know if you’re interested in meeting? We can go grab some coffee or lunch. And if you live far we can totally be friends and share memes and silly IG reels.

I match energy with people. If I feel you stop sharing interest or don't seem to care about making an actual connection, I will drop you. I don't chase or waste my time with others that don't wish to reciprocate the same effort and energy as I do. [selfie](https://imgur.com/a/H6zW4TA)",2,1729233376.0,lesbianr4r,1,0.75,False

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/s/D4oKhPvUOy) - Post Oct 18 


** A woman died in my arms on Second Ave this week and I’d like her family to know she didn’t die alone. Help me find them.**

Around 7pm on Monday I spotted an elderly woman (Black/brown, around 75-85 years old) lying on the sidewalk of 63rd and 2nd Avenue. She had a Bloomingdales shopping bag and a pink handbag (just mentioning for possible identification). Something was clearly wrong. She was not able to form words anymore, but was still conscious. I sat by her and put her head on my lap, told her to breath, keep her eyes open, and I held her hand and stroked her hair to soothe her.

Someone called an ambulance. She unfortunately passed away minutes later, in my arms, it would still take some time for the ambulance to arrive. Someone tried cpr but to no avail. The ambulance took her away, I think they kept trying cpr for a while but I’m afraid she had really passed. 

I forgot to give the ambulance personel my information. I regret it so much, because I would want her family to know she didn’t just pass away alone on the cold and dark sidewalk. That she had a bunch of strangers caring for her, and talking to her, that her hair was stroked and her hand was held, that we tried our best. 

I called Mount Sinai hospital the next day (that had been the ambulance). The operator put me in touch with the West Emergency Room on 59 St and to someone else. But everyone told me that they couldn’t pass a message to the family, because I didn’t have her name or DOB. I asked them “isn’t the time and exact pickup location enough?” but everyone said no. 

Please, can someone (at Mount Sinai) help me or does anyone have advice?

TL;dr: I would like to give a message to the family that she didn’t die alone - I have the location and pick up time of the Mount Sinai ambulance (Monday 14 October, 7.10pm, south west corner of 63rd and second ave) but they tell me they can’t connect me. How can I find her family? 

[UPDATE Thursday 17th: I have reached out to the chaplains of Mount Sinai and NY Presbyterian, as well as the New York Medical Examiner’s office and Patch UES news. I have no idea how likely I am to get a response. May also write to the New York Times if I can find the time today. Will go by Bloomingdales next Monday around that same time and see if that leads anywhere. Thank you for all your great suggestions: keep them coming! And on a more personal note, your kind words are truly quite healing.]

** [UPDATE] We found the family of the woman who passed away surrounded by caring strangers!**


In follow-up to [yesterday’s post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1g5ehoa/a_woman_died_in_my_arms_on_second_ave_this_week/): with the help of you guys I was able to find the family of the woman who sadly passed away in my arms on an UES sidewalk, and let them know she didn’t die in solitude. I’m so grateful :’)

Because you all commented and upvoted, this post had a wide reach. It lead to one reader referring her friend to this thread, after hearing about a loss she experienced this week that resembled my story. I received a private message. And one long and heartfelt phonecall later - for which I’m eternally grateful - and an exchanged picture to confirm the identity, we knew we were talking about the same person. (I’m sharing this update with the friend’s consent.)

The woman’s family mostly lives in India, they had been informed about her death by the hospital, but had not received information about the circumstances of her passing. The friend will now be telling the family about the group of people that rubbed her shoulders to stay warm, stroked her hair and tried to comfort her in those final moments. 

A sweet little fun fact that goes to show how connected we are even though we are strangers in this big city: turns out the woman used to be a chemistry professor at the same university where I work as a history researcher. 

May she rest in peace, and may her family be well. And a big special thank you to those other folks that were there on 63rd Street when it happened. 

Below I’m going to list a few of your recommendations that felt really helpful to me, if you ever find yourself in a similar situation. But most importantly, I’d like to emphasize the importance of checking in on one another in public spaces - especially with winter nearing. Just check to make sure if someone’s ‘just sleeping’ on the street (I mean, I wish in general that no one had to), or if something bigger is off. Whether homeless or returning from shopping at Bloomingdales, everyone deserves a closer glance, let’s look out for each other. (Don’t mean this in a saintly way, I don’t always check in as I would like, but let’s all keep trying.)

Lastly, I truly believe it is an unhealthy sign of the medical system that it is made to seem impossible to pass along a message to a family when the location, pick-up time and emblem of an ambulance are known. I understand the importance of privacy laws and regulations. But I didn’t ask for her name, or to be able to contact the family directly. I just asked Mount Sinai to tell the family that a loved one didn’t die alone. That shouldn’t be a big ask, and that sure shouldn’t be a violation of anything. 

Thank you all, and here are some tips in the meantime if you find yourself in a similar situation 

- Reach out to hospital chaplains, they are a more human point of contact than a rigid hospital phone menu.
- Reach out to local elderly centers or local community centers, they may know the person who passed
- Contact the New York Office of the Medical Examiner (I haven’t heard back but maybe I would’ve in a few days)
- Scan obituaries using word filters (there are some websites that combine them all, if I’m not mistaken)
- Play Tetris in the days after a shocking event, which apparently can help prevent trauma from forming
- Contact funeral homes if none of the above works
- Hang up signs in the streets (I actually printed out a bunch, but it turned out not to be needed any longer)
- And last but certainly not least: try posting in the AskNYC reddit group:)

I am using grind size 2 from Third Wave diablo blend. I specifically asked them for an espresso blend. I've tried a couple of times, tinkered around the amount of water to be let through. If it is for a longer time, it's even more watery. If it's for a short time, it's still watery. Seems more like a drip coffee machine rather than an espresso. 

Any tips on getting espresso level consistency?

I understand that it's an entry level Chinese machine but fundamentally it should give me an espresso, albiet lower quality. 

This seems like money down the drain.

1g6bo3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepAuthors/comments/1g6bo3b/does_this_story_fit/,Does this story fit?,"Hey guys, first time poster here. To make a long story short I got into an accident while drunk, and got sentenced to 50 hours of AA and community service along with a hefty fine with a suspended license dangling off the side of this shit sundae. The minor details don’t matter for the context of this story so I won't speak on it. So yeah, it's a Friday night. Prime time for bar hopping but here I am sitting in an artificially lit room with bad coffee, and slightly worse company. Not to say that they were bad people, but why would we be compatible? I know, alcohol isn't all there is to life, and I agree with you. But this place is such a downer that I can't help but feel a little ill will. It's better than the county so I can't really complain that much. It's my first night though, maybe one or two of the folks will grow on me. 

“I'd like to start off this meeting by addressing the new person in our group. Would you like to introduce yourself?”

He passes me this brightly colored stick with a feather tied to it with neon string.

“Uh the name is Mike, and I got court ordered to be here. I know I'm supposed to say I'm an alcoholic but honestly I just like drinking. I don't have a problem with it, I'm just here for my hours.”

I pass the stick back to the group leader

“Well, thank you for sharing Mike, I just want to remind you that if you want those hours signed off you have to participate.”

I nod submissively 

“Alright, who wants to go first?”

As the group trades experiences, and the talking stick amongst each other I see this woman walk in. She looks pretty from a distance, but when she gets closer you can tell that she's not keeping up with herself. Dirty clothes, a faint smell. She sits next to me since that was the only free chair there was. 

“Let's take a moment to welcome the new face in the room, Brian can you pass the talking stick to her?”

Brian passes the talking stick to the mystery woman but she slowly extends her arm like she's hesitant about the mere act of speaking a word. Though she does take it after a moment. 

“Hi everyone my name is Evelyn, and I have a drinking problem.” 

Everyone murmurs a hi Evelyn, I parrot the crowd after a short delay. 

“It all started about two weeks ago. Before that I wouldn't even consider having a drink if it wasn't the weekend. I don't know what changed in me but I started having these intense migraines that for some reason only alcohol could soothe. It spiraled from there, and here I am horribly sober, and unsure if this is the right choice. The doctor said I'm fine, and everything checks out but I don't know.”

The group leader chimes up after motioning for the talking stick.

“Thank you for sharing Evelyn, and no, you made the right decision. Life is hard but alcohol only makes life that much harder.

“What a load of crap.” I thought. The only thing that makes a bad day good is a cold beer.

“We go by the twelve step program here at AA Evelyn, are you familiar with it?”

She shakes her head

“Well the first step to being alcohol free is to admit that we are powerless in our addiction. And the second step is to acknowledge there is a power that can restore us to sanity.”

Evelyn motions for the talking stick which The group leader handed happily.

“give yourself over to a higher power?”

They pass the stick again. Talking stick? More like a passing stick. Jesus, this 50 hours of this is going to drive me insane. 

“Yes, it doesn't have to be a specific religion. Any belief will work.”

She closes her eyes in acknowledgement. He continues to say that they go by the buddy system. That means that everyone has one person in this group that they can rely on so that they're not going through the twelve steps alone. And wouldn't you guess it, everyone already has a buddy. So it would only be natural that I became Evelyn's buddy. Meeting ends, I get my first two hours signed off. I turn to the door, and when I get out I see Evelyn smoking a cigarette. She looks kinda happy. 

“You got another one of those?”

She hands me her pack, and I pull one out. I pull out a lighter and light it. I handed her pack back to her.

“thanks.”

I grunt as I exhale the smoke.

“You're welcome.”

We both stand there for a weird amount of time without talking. I break the silence.

“So, uh want my number? Since we're buddies now it'll just be easier.”

“Sure.”

She hands me her phone and I put in my number. 

“It was my first night too.”

I mumbled out. The cold air stinging my lips as I breathe out to speak. 

“It was? Why are you here? By choice or…?”

“I got court ordered to. Two hours down forty eight to go.”

“That sounds rough. Don't worry I'll make it easy for you.”

She smiles cutely. I blush slightly from her reply. 

“Don't worry about it, I can handle it.”

With that I put out the cigarette with my boot, and I said goodbye. 

Now let's fast forward to the next week since nothing of real importance happened. She didn't call, or text besides one text about half a week in. She just said that the twelve step program was helping her. I'm glad that this program actually does help people who want to quit get over their dependency with alcohol. I go into the next week with a renewed sense of vigor. I have someone counting on me to get them where they need to be. I walk in about five minutes early, the usual suspects are walking in, some are getting what I'm assuming to be a cup of motor oil. I look around the room for Evelyn. And there I saw her, in the same seat she was in before. I walk up to sit down next to her.

“How ya doin’?” 

She turns around, and I see a different woman. Not physically, but there is this light in her eyes that wasn't there before. 

“Yeah I'm great! My migraines even went away!”

She says beaming ear to ear.

“Hey that's great Evelyn! I'm happy to hear that.”

“I can't wait for the third step!”

She says it in a frantic tone. I thought at the time that she was just extremely motivated for self improvement, but now I'm not so sure.

The group sits down, and the group leader holds out the talking stick. Its neon colors are an utter eyesore. 

“who wants to start first?”

Evelyn perks her hand up first with alarming speed that only I seem to have noticed.

“I would love to start.”

The group leader smiles and hands her the talking stick

“I'm so happy to see you doing so much better Evelyn.”

Evelyn grabs the stick with both hands. Her knuckles are turning white.

“Hi Evelyn here, I've been sober for one week, and I have to be honest I've never felt better! I need to know what the third step is.”

She passes the stick to the group leader as quickly as her hands would allow. The group leader takes it without regard to those twitchy movements. Was he trying to be polite? 

“The third step is to give yourself over to that God, utterly and completely.”

She closes her eyes and smiles hard. I thought this was insane. How is everyone just accepting this without even a grimace?

The rest of the group goes on as normal, I barely got my hours in with how distracted I was from that whole thing. When it finished I tried to just head to the bus stop. When Evelyn shows up from around the corner.

“Hey buddy! Where ya goin’?”

I put on a facsimile of a smile even though I felt a growing unease with her presence. 

“Oh I'm heading to the bus stop to go home.”

“I can drive you!”

She says with that same grin, that light I once saw turned into a glint of madness with the way she was bending and moving like she was doing ballet moves while getting ready to play a round of football.

“N-No I'm fine. Thanks though.""

I'm ashamed to admit it as a six foot man that weighs 215 pounds but this petite woman is scaring me. And there was no way I was going to let that woman know where I live. 

“Aw, why not? I just wanna show my buddy how much I care about them.”

“No, I'm fine, I like the walk home. It's really nice out tonight.” 

The smile twitches for a moment as she holds her eye contact.

“Well if you insist!”

She snaps back to being animated again. 

“Get home safe buddy.”

This is where we're caught up with the story. The next meeting is in a couple of days, and Evelyne just messaged me that she's embraced the third step. I'm not sure if being free is worth it.

1g6bmyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1g6bmyo/how_to_style_your_living_room_with_statement/,How to Style Your Living Room with Statement Furniture Pieces,"Your living room is more than just a place to relax—it's the heart of your home, where design meets function and style speaks volumes. One of the best ways to elevate this space is by incorporating statement furniture pieces that not only serve a purpose but also catch the eye. From bold coffee tables to unique side tables, the right [living room furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture) can transform an ordinary space into an extraordinary one. Here's how to style your living room with statement pieces that reflect your personality and aesthetic.

**1. Start with a Bold Coffee Table**

The coffee table is often the centerpiece of a living room, so why not make it a statement piece? Whether you prefer sleek and modern designs or rustic and textured, a [coffee table for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/coffee-tables) can be both functional and stylish. Opt for a large glass table with gold accents for a touch of elegance, or go for a chunky wooden table to add warmth and character. A coffee table with a sculptural design or interesting texture will immediately draw attention and set the tone for the rest of your decor.

**Styling Tip:**

Complement your statement coffee table with a beautiful tray, decorative books, and a vase of fresh flowers. Keep the styling minimal to allow the table’s design to shine.

**2. Choose Unique Side Tables**

Side tables are often overlooked, but they can make a huge impact in your living room. Rather than choosing basic, functional options, consider adding [side tables for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/side-tables) that stand out. Think of unique shapes, unexpected materials, or vibrant colors. A side table with a marble top, for example, adds sophistication, while one with an abstract metal base brings in a modern edge. These pieces are perfect for showcasing small decor items like candles, plants, or art books, adding both style and practicality to your space.

**Styling Tip:**

When selecting side tables, consider mixing and matching styles. Pair a traditional table on one side of the sofa with a contemporary piece on the other to create an eclectic look that feels curated.

**3. Invest in a Statement Sofa or Armchair**

While coffee tables and side tables make a statement, your sofa or armchair should also contribute to the overall aesthetic. Consider a bold color, such as deep green or royal blue, or a luxurious material like velvet or leather. The sofa anchors the room, so choose a design that reflects your personal style. If a large sofa feels overwhelming, a striking armchair can be just as impactful. Look for unique shapes, oversized designs, or patterned upholstery to create a focal point.

**Styling Tip:**

Layer throw pillows and blankets in complementary colors and textures to soften the look of your statement furniture while still letting it shine.

**4. Balance with Neutral Accents**

When working with statement furniture, balance is key. Too many bold pieces can make the room feel cluttered, so offset your standout coffee and side tables with neutral accent pieces. A soft, neutral rug or simple curtains can ground the space and allow your living room furniture to take center stage.

**Styling Tip:**

Use neutral tones for larger items like the sofa and rug, then add pops of color or metallic accents through your side tables and coffee tables.

**5. Personalize with Art and Decor**

Finally, enhance your statement furniture with carefully selected decor. Incorporate large pieces of artwork, interesting light fixtures, and plants to add personality and warmth. These elements not only bring your space together but also highlight your statement pieces, creating a cohesive and stylish living room.

By choosing the right coffee tables for living room, side tables for living room, and bold furniture pieces, you can craft a space that feels unique and inviting. Statement furniture is all about expressing your style, so don’t be afraid to go big and bold with your choices. The key is to balance these standout pieces with complementary accents, resulting in a living room that feels well-designed and thoughtfully curated.",1,1729232557.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

1g6bl02,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1g6bl02/does_anyone_else_feel_like_their_kid_hates_them/,Does anyone else feel like their kid hates them ,"For context, I live with my parents right now because my husband and I are saving up for a house. My parents spoil her pretty badly.

So my daughter is 15 months old. Recently in the last month and a half or so she’s been behaving very badly. I know this is normal and it doesn’t bother me. However, I seem to be the only one who disciplines her or tells her no. My parents let her do whatever she wants. My husband helps me but works 24-48 hour shifts a lot and he isn’t here as much as we would like him to be.

Some examples of things I discipline her for are her grabbing things off of our coffee table, running in my parents room and slamming the door on me, opening cabinets she shouldn’t be opening (we have baby proofed and she rips them open anyways), hitting us, screaming at us. She’s recently taken up growling at us if we annoy her I’m not even kidding it’s like something out of the exorcist.

And now since I’m the only one who really disciplines her, I am public enemy #1. She growls at me even if I walk in the room she’s in. I can’t put her to bed, I can’t spend time with her, I can’t do anything with her because she’s constantly pissed at me. Is this normal? 

I do not do anything physical with her at all, the most I will do is pick her up and remove her from whatever she’s doing while saying no. And I know tantrums are normal at this age. But just tonight, she got up at 12 am and my parents and I were still up. My mom got her up, we changed her and gave her some milk and she wasn’t going back to bed so I told my mom we should just lay her down. So I went to pick her up to put her back in bed and she lost her ever loving mind. Was screaming, tears, and hitting me. 

I put her to bed because at that point she had annoyed me and she went right to sleep? Does she hate me or what is happening.

1g6bkji,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g6bkji/is_it_delusional_to_think_well_end_up_together/,Is it delusional to think we’ll end up together?,"I (24M) met (27F) on a dating app a little over a week ago. We immediately connected. An experience and feeling I really didn’t think existed. We talked for 30 minutes, exchanged contact info, and planned the first date. I really thought I was over the whole “gushy texting” thing that comes with most relationships, but everything flowed so naturally. We talked and talked every day and night until our first date, which was 6am coffee. I drove to her place and waited outside of my car for her to come down. When she walked outside my heart skipped a beat and time started to slow. We hugged and greeted and drove off to get our coffee. Once we got our order, we sat it the parking lot and just talked. It was the easiest time I’d ever experienced talking to someone new. We talked about life, music taste, religious/political views, and what really fired us up. I couldn’t help but to get lost in her eyes every time I turned to reply. I really couldn’t tell if I was dreaming. We sat in that lot for 2 hours and drove back to her place, and sat in the parking lot for ANOTHER 2 hours. So much was shared, and when I turned to ask her something, she went in for the kiss. As soon as our lips met there were sparks flying. A warm and gentle feeling and our hands intertwined. The chemistry was immaculate. We were there until 10am and so much passion was shared. When it was time to depart, I got out and hugged her goodbye. I knew that she was the one the second I let go, I was already falling in love with this astonishingly amazing woman, whom I connected with on the deepest levels. I sent her an “I miss you” text before I even left the parking lot (cheesy I know) and she was just so happy about the entire experience. She went off to work, we messaged constantly throughout the day, and I found myself being invited back over to her place the night. She is the first person I have ever been 100% honest and open with, no closed door, nothing to hide, right out of the gate. We talked about the future, what long term goals looked like, and the stars were aligned. She already has kids, and that’s something that I had zero hesitation about. I personally don’t need to have kids of my own to live a happy and fulfilling life. I left around 4am and I’m sure it can be inferred how the remainder of the evening went. This was the most magical time I’ve ever experienced with another human being, and I was previously engaged to an ex I was with for 4 years (a story for a different time). We had another coffee date for our second date, and took an extravagant day trip out of state for our 3rd date. With her I felt free. No disagreements, no clashing, no arguments. Just a purely blissful experience through and through. 

The tough part

Two days after our trip she had messaged me with concerns for her current situation (we both struggle with mental illness) and said that I was just so amazing and sweet and good to her, but she needed to get her situation sorted out before moving forward with anything. It felt like everything, all the momentum built, had come to a halt. I couldn’t be upset or angry at her for that. I mean I truly believe that we were meant to eventually cross paths and enjoy life together. I continued to express my feelings on the situation, and told her that I would be okay but it definitely hurt to think about. The important thing is that she’s doing the best thing for her right now. The days following, we still texted, but my depression started eating away at me. It made me wonder what I had done wrong, why did it end up this way, and it left me lying in bed for 2 days straight. I had cancelled plans, called out of work, and just laid there with my heart broken. I wanted to get answers as to how it would proceed or ultimately get closure so I could move forward. She told me that I didn’t scare her away, that I did nothing wrong, and that I was one of the sweetest people she had ever met, she just needed to get this figured out for herself. I told her that regardless of whether we’re together, friends, or whatever the situation may be, I will always be in her corner cheering her on. We’re on great terms, but I don’t know if getting back together is a pipe dream or realistic. She is all I could ever ask for or want in someone. She is someone I would move mountains for to ensure she gets the life that she deserves. She knows how I feel, and I would and will continue to remind her just how strong she is for being able to push through all of the shit she’s been through, and provide for her kids the way that she does. Right now I’m holding on to the hope that we will get back together after, but for now just being here for her is okay with me - as long as she’s happy and getting into a better situation. 

For context: I have talked to her about the possibility of getting back together after. This post was mostly written to express my feelings and to gain outside perspective. We also made it exclusive at the end of the night of our first date.",1,1729232262.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
