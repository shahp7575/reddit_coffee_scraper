1prb2zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1prb2zy/im_extremely_confusedtelling_her_how_i_feel/,I'm extremely confused/telling her how i feel.,"Hi, so a little background: about five years ago I was cheated on in a very extreme way, and since then I’ve had a lot of trauma around letting anyone into my life — let alone dating. Even though I did go out with a few girls over the years, it never really felt right.



This is where things get complicated. I met this girl a long time ago, but she was extremely shy — that’s just who she is. Very hard to get through to, and honestly she felt like she was leagues above me. Combined with my dating trauma, I never really approached her for about a year.



Then about three months ago, there was this random event where she was there. We were drunk and had a great time — no kissing or anything — but I remember thinking, “Holy shit, is this really her?” She wasn’t that shy girl anymore; she was happy, dancing, open, and it was honestly amazing to see.



The next day I thought, “Screw it, she’s probably out of my league, but I’ll shoot my shot,” and I texted her. She started replying immediately, sending reels and engaging, but I got scared and deleted my Instagram — that’s kind of my pattern when things start to feel too serious. Still, she got my phone number and texted me about a week later, which honestly shocked me, because that was a huge step outside her comfort zone.



From there, we started texting again. She had some trips planned, and even while she was on girls’ trips, she would still text me. Eventually I asked her out, we went on a date — nothing crazy — and we kept texting, going for coffee breaks, and spending time together. Over time, she really started coming out of her shell, and it was incredible to see. I was genuinely so happy just watching her shine.



This is where I think I messed up. Earlier this week, I got extremely drunk. I might have been a bit too touchy — I don’t fully remember, because I was really drunk. The event itself was boring, and afterward we went home. She texted me when she got home and asked me to text her once I got home too. I ended up apologizing like five times for making her uncomfortable in front of her friends. She said it was all fine, but knowing her, I feel like it really wasn’t.



The next day we texted like nothing happened, and she replied almost immediately, but I can’t shake the feeling that I messed things up badly. I spent months slowly building this wall of trust, and now it feels like 80% of it collapsed in one night. I’ve been overthinking that night all week, and it’s been killing me.



On top of that, this year has been absolutely awful. I’ve had so many personal and family issues to deal with, and now the pressure and uncertainty around this girl are getting to me too. I don’t have the energy anymore — I want to, but I’m not sleeping, I’m not eating, and it’s just been a horrible year overall.



Because of that, I’ve decided to ask her out for a coffee and just be honest. I want to ask her what we are and where this is going. She’s always known that I like her, and I feel like she kind of likes me too, but I need to know whether we’re on the same path. Something that once gave me peace and happiness is now causing me a lot of anxiety.



I do like her a lot. She’s been extremely complicated, and I don’t know if she’s worth the emotional toll, but I need closure — or at least some indication of whether this is moving toward a relationship. I know people often say not to tell someone how you feel, but at this point I have to. I just don’t really know how.

The shrill ring of my cell phone—far too close to my ear—yanked me out of a nap I’d barely managed to fall into. My head throbbed as consciousness rushed back, the kind of ache that came from exhaustion layered upon exhaustion. Thirty-six hours on my feet, two back-to-back shifts because my relief doctor had called in sick, and an emergency room that had refused to slow down for even a second.



I groaned softly and squinted up at the dim fluorescent light buzzing overhead. The on-call room smelled faintly of antiseptic and burnt coffee, a scent that had become far too familiar. Dragging the phone to my ear, I answered without checking the screen.



“Where are you?” Melissa’s voice came through in a whisper, sharp and urgent. “Do you know who’s back?”



My pulse kicked up instantly. “Caleb St. Vincent?” The name slipped out before I could stop it, betraying me. The image followed just as quickly—tall, broad-shouldered, devastatingly handsome, with the kind of confidence that filled a room without effort. “Is he okay,” I added quickly, “or is it his son?”



“His son,” she replied. “But not for sickle cell. Think he either broke or sprained his ankle. And listen—Dr. Flores still isn’t here. This is your chance to finally meet him.”



“Not like this,” I muttered, already swinging my legs off the narrow hospital bed.



I pushed myself upright and caught my reflection in the small mirror above the sink. For someone who had slept maybe four hours in a day and a half, I didn’t look half-dead. My eyes were still bright, my face clean. I’d clipped my shoulder-length twists into a careless ponytail before collapsing earlier, but at least it looked intentional. Presentable enough. Professional enough.



“Girl,” Melissa continued, clearly amused, “don’t be stuck on stupid. You’ve been crushing on this man. You were the one who told me how incredible of an athlete he was, when all I could see was a fine-ass muthafucka.”



A laugh slipped out before I could stop it. “Lower your voice. I hope no one can hear you.” I shook my head, even though she couldn’t see me. “And I’ve never crushed on him. I happen to love football and admire his talent. That’s it.”



“Mmhmm. And I’m the Virgin Mary,” she shot back. “Can you be human for once and admit you’d kill to let that man sex you down one good time? Just once. Then you could die happy.”



“Please tell me you’re alone,” I said, turning on the faucet and grabbing a few napkins from the dispenser. “Or better yet, locked in your office.”



She laughed softly. “Everyone’s running around like a chicken with its head cut off. I’ve been covering for you so you could rest, but the patients are screaming for their doctor. Mostly standard stuff. An eighty-year-old with a concussion from a slip, another patient with pulmonary embolisms—blood clots in the lungs. He’s stable and on treatment while we wait for vascular.”



I pressed the cool, damp napkins to my face, letting the chill revive me. The fog in my head began to lift. “Then Mr. St. Vincent can’t be a priority.”



“He donates to the hospital,” Melissa reminded me. “He’s always a priority.”



“And that,” I said flatly, “is exactly why I don’t have a crush. He’s arrogant. Entitled. All alpha energy and demands.” I rolled my eyes. “He walks in like his family is the only one in pain. As good as he looks—in person and on paper—we’d clash constantly. I don’t deal well with entitlement.”



“Brooklyn,” she sighed, “all those years in med school got you stuck on stupid. Alpha men love a challenge, and you’re the ultimate one—a woman who doesn’t think she needs him.”



I grabbed the small bottle of mouthwash from under the sink and scoffed. “I see how you slipped in think. I don’t need him—or any man. Never have. My life is good.” I swished the minty liquid around my mouth. “I’d rather be single and at peace than trapped in something toxic just to say I have a man.”



“Relax. Nobody’s asking you to marry him,” she said. “Just have some fun. When’s the last time you got out of scrubs, got pretty, and went on a date? Or better yet—had some mindless sex?”



I didn’t answer.



“That’s what I thought,” she continued smugly. “Crickets. At least let yourself feel something—with him or someone.”



“You act like I have a chance just because I’m the treating resident,” I replied, spitting into the sink. “Caleb St. Vincent doesn’t even know I exist. And right now, he’s a worried father. I’m not about to be that thirsty woman shooting her shot in the ER.”



“He doesn’t know you exist,” Melissa snapped, “because you won’t let anyone see you. You’re gorgeous and brilliant, yet all you do is work and hang out with your mama.”



I snorted. “Until Mama finds another man—which should be any day now.” My mother treated relationships like chapters. When one ended, she turned the page without regret.



“Exactly,” Melissa said triumphantly. “Even your mama knows you have to get out there.”



“I don’t believe in looking for a man,” I said quietly. “Unlike her.”



“Well, lucky for you, you don’t have to look. He’s sitting in a room with his son, waiting for his doctor. That sounds like fate to me.”



Before I could protest, I heard her turn away and address someone else. “Dr. Kelley is checking on 24E. No worries—she knows to be discreet. We really need Dr. Craviz in 18A. She’s been here since yesterday morning, and we don’t want mistakes from exhaustion.”



“No, you didn’t,” I hissed into the phone.



“Oh yes, I did,” she replied smugly. “You’re welcome. Now get your ass here. Mr. St. Vincent has pressed the call button twice because no one’s tending to his son. Vitals and bloodwork are good—no elevated white count, no infection. Just waiting on your IV orders. X-ray is on the way.”



I took one last look in the mirror, silently grateful that my purple scrubs fit better than most of my civilian clothes. Pulling the clip from my hair, I let my twists fall naturally around my shoulders and slipped on my lab coat.



As I hurried across the ER, weaving past rooms filled with pain, fear, and urgency, I felt the familiar adrenaline surge. Weekends were always like this—especially with Thanksgiving only two days away. The chaos grounded me. It kept me from overthinking the choices I’d made… from dwelling on the life I’d walked away from, or the one I hadn’t quite figured out how to live yet.



And yet, as I approached the room where Caleb St. Vincent waited, my heartbeat told me this encounter was about to disrupt more than just my shift.

Taking a deep breath when I approached 24E, I walked in briskly.

Bedside manner and professionalism covered my eager smile. I mean...the

brother was fine. Caleb St. Vincent looked up when I entered the room, and

his dark gaze swept my body before settling on my face. He didn’t smile,

though his eyes radiated warmth. “We’ve been here over an hour with no

word. Time is of the essence with my son, and this hospital knows that.”

“My apologies. It’s incredibly busy during the holidays. I hope we have

been kind to you and your son while you waited.” I bit down the retort that

most people waited hours for a non-threatening emergency like a sprained

ankle on a day like this. Yep, spoiled and entitled, but oh so sexy even with

that Dodgers baseball cap on his head. Focus. “I’m Dr. Avery Collins,

the attending doctor for your son.” I nodded at him before focusing on the

patient: his beloved son, who’d been a patient due to his disease off and on

over the years. “Good afternoon, Sekani. Am I pronouncing your name

right?”

“Yes, Ma’am.” The handsome teen, whose dark eyes and smile were

similar to his father’s, tucked his head sheepishly. “Trying to catch a pass

that my father threw wide, I twisted my ankle. I’m fine, but this worried old

man made me come here.”

“I’ve had enough injuries to know when we can ignore it or when we

need to get it checked out. Need fluids while we’re here to make sure he

stays hydrated,” he said to me before replying to his son, “And I didn’t

throw wide. Told you to pay attention to the angle of the ball. If you

listened, you wouldn’t have twisted your ankle.”

I reassured Carter, “I can make sure we get some fluids going to make

sure his cells don’t sickle.”

Carter’s brow furrowed. “Have you cared for my son before? How do

you know he has sickle cell?”

“No, I haven’t. I checked his records before stepping in here,” I

improvised. “I also wanted to check with your son first on his level of pain

before we give him his usual pain meds.”

Carter continued to look skeptical. “Waiting for meds and fluids doesn’t

really help him since you apparently know his medical history, though

you’ve never treated him.”

I bristled under his scrutiny. “I consider any patient who walks through

our doors as my patient, especially on a day like today when other doctors

call in. And if you must know, I pay special attention to the sickle cell

patients when they come into the ER to make sure they’re treated right by

the doctors and nurses who don’t understand the disease and want to

assume that the patients are drug-seeking because they happen to be black

and need pain meds. It’s a slippery slope between need and addiction, but I

prefer to err on the side of need since no one deserves to sit in pain because

the medical profession can be biased against our people.” Taking a calming

breath, I added, “Sekani is in good hands with me. However, if you prefer

another doctor to take over, I can arrange that, though it would be a huge

mistake.”

“Why?” His eyes narrowed.

“Because I’m the best resident in this ER.” It wasn’t my nature to brag

about my accomplishments, but his condescending tone grated on my

nerves.

Carter settled back in his chair, his frown relaxing, still watching me.

“Don’t mean to seem paranoid. You would be amazed at what people do to

get close to me.”

“Not every woman wants you.” Sekani teased with a chuckle.

Carter’s glance swept my body again before addressing his son. “If she

doesn’t, she will.”

“Here he go.” Sekani rolled his eyes.

Heat flamed my cheeks at the obvious flirtation, and I cleared my

throat. “I wanted to step in first before I ordered the fluids.” Donning the

gloves from the box at the foot of the bed, I moved to the edge and picked

up the ice pack resting on his injury. The red and purplish bruise on his

swollen ankle did look painful. “The X-ray tech should be here in a few. In

the meantime, can you rotate your foot for me?”

Sekani grimaced while he complied.

“Good movement. Probably a sprain like you guessed,” I reassured

Sekani. “That ice pack should work for now to reduce the swelling. Have

you taken anything at home for the pain?”

Sekani shook his head. “I try not to take pain meds unless I absolutely

have to take them. My pain level is about a five.”

“Still too high. We won’t have to worry about any counter effects with

any drug we give you. And we want to reduce that pain to at least one,

okay? Prescribed Tylenol should work. Let’s save the Demerol or stronger

meds for when you really need them.” I smiled at Sekani, who seemed like

a respectful son, not an entitled one whose father was worth millions. “I

want you to take at least two bags of fluid to make sure your cells don’t

sickle. Might be here for only a couple more hours if the X-rays show what

I believe they will. Would you like some juice or crackers, too?”

“Cranberry?” Sekani asked with a soft smile.

“I can arrange that.”

I sighed inwardly before looking at Carter, whose steady, interested

gaze as I treated his son intimidated me. “Any questions or anything you

need from me before I leave?”

“You think I can have some of your delicious cranberry juice? I mean, if

it’s not too much trouble to ask the best resident in the ER.” He chuckled.

The genuine warmth of his laughter tickled me, and I left the room,

smiling, glad that Melissa insisted that I be assigned to Malakai St. Vincent.

At the nurse’s station, Melissa clapped in delight when she pointed at my

smile. “He noticed you, didn’t he?”

I glanced around the area for listening ears before I replied, “He seems

like a natural flirt, so I don’t know if he noticed me or not because I’m his

son’s doctor. Besides, I’m sure that man has women. Even if he didn’t have

money and fame, he would attract them.”

“Ain’t nothing wrong with being one of those women. Have a little fun

if the opportunity presents itself.” She pushed the bags of fluid toward me.

“I prepared this for you. I think since he’s already complained, it’s best you

go back in there instead of one of the nurses.”

“The patient doesn’t appear to be in any pain besides his ankle. Tylenol

should work, and don’t think I don’t know what you keep trying to make

happen.” I started pushing the IV pole when I remembered to grab a couple

of bottles of cranberry juice out of the small refrigerator behind the nursing

station.

A woman’s concerned voice greeted me as I opened the door to the

room. “Why do you insist on pushing football on him?""

“He didn’t, Mama. I asked him to show me,” Sakani replied. “I’m

alright. Stop treating me like I can’t do anything when I don’t even have the

worst kind of sickle cell.”

I cleared my throat before walking fully into the room, and Sekani’s

mother stopped talking. Standing next to Carter, who remained in the chair,

was a beautiful, earthy woman with Jill Scott vibes who gave me a quick

once-over and brusquely asked, “What are you giving him?”

Hold your tongue, Brooklyn. “Good afternoon, I’m Dr. Avery Collins,

his treating doctor. I’m giving him fluids and Tylenol to take. Demerol is on

hand if the Tylenol isn’t enough. His vitals and bloodwork look good. The

X-ray tech will be here in a few, though I’m sure it’s a sprain, and you all

will be able to go home soon.” I moved to the opposite side of the bed from

his mother and smiled at an annoyed Sekani. “I have your juice.”

“Do you have mine?” Carter asked, kindness coating his voice, more

than the flirtatiousness he’d demonstrated earlier.

“Yes.” As I started to walk to give it to him, the woman held out her

hand across the bed to receive it.

She gave him the bottle as she explained. “Sorry about my tone, you

know how I worry.” Then she bent to peck Carter’s lips.

A low rumble of disappointment settled in the pit of my stomach at her

display of possessive affection while I flushed Sekani’s IV with a needle

before I finished setting up his bag. “Two bags, okay? If you need to use the

restroom, have your parents help you out of bed. I’ll be back once I have

the X-ray results. Buzz if you need anything.” I only gave Sekani direct eye

contact and barely acknowledged the couple before leaving the room,

hating the wave of hope that had been erased in a matter of seconds.

“His woman, Sekani’s mother, is here,” I whispered at Melissa’s

questioning gaze.

She frowned. “So, they broke up a while ago, according to the media.”

“Not from what I can tell.” My cell buzzed, and I eased it out of my top

pocket.

You have every right to still be angry. Can we please talk?

“Hell, no,” I exclaimed without thought.

“Asshole again?”

“Yep. Still don’t want to talk about it. Three years, and now he keeps

bothering me.” The humiliation and rageful hurt of the last time I saw him

inflamed my chest. I grabbed a chart. “Got two more hours and I’m out. I

don’t care who else calls out, I need to sleep, and the hospital beds aren’t

cutting it.”

“Okay. Okay. I’ll handle the rest of this shift. Dr. Noto should also be

here within an hour.” She typed in a note on her keypad. “Want to grab a

late dinner or cocktails tomorrow night since you’re off?”

“Naw. I’m exhausted. Need to prep for Thanksgiving dinner with Mama

and Auntie Max, who’s in town anyway. Maybe a Happy Hour next week?”

I tapped the counter, shook off the flood of emotions from the interaction

with Carter and then my ex, and continued making rounds.

I needed the quick reminder that men brought more drama than peace.

And the turtle slid back in her shell.

After another tense moment with Sekani’s mother, as I told the St.

Patrick family that it was indeed a sprain and how to treat it at home, and

checking on my other patients, I headed to the cafeteria. I sank into a chair

near a window, used my arms as a pillow, and closed my eyes. A little bit

longer and I’m out. My brief chemistry buzz with Carter quickly fizzled

once Sekani’s mother arrived. Clearly, she either picked up the vibe

between her man and me, or she knew her man’s wandering eye. The

dullness of my head mirrored my heart. Why would I get my hopes up for

an ex-NFL player just because he spoke to me? Or maybe my ex reaching

out to me over the last three months fucked with my self-confidence more

than I realized?

My cell rang. With closed eyes, I reached down in my scrub pocket and

pulled out my phone, hoping I didn’t have to block my ex.

Mama.

I propped the phone against my ear, with my head still on the table.

“Guess what, Brookie Cookie?”

“Mama, I’m way too old for that nickname.”

“Never too old.” She shushed me as she always did. “Your Auntie found

us a cheap flight to a spa in Vegas for Thanksgiving. We have to leave

tonight for the deal, and we’re there until Monday. Can you get away?”

I popped up. “Vegas? Mama, you know I can’t. I’m only off tomorrow

and Thanksgiving.” This was when I hated being an only child of a single

mother and a father who preferred his new wife to his daughter, which

meant holidays were often small or nonexistent. “I thought we were going

grocery shopping tomorrow and having a quiet dinner for Thanksgiving.

Mama huffed, “Call in like every other person does, and let’s have fun

in Vegas. I’m sick and tired of turkey and dressing.”

“You know I can’t. Not during holidays. We can get fired or at least

written up.”

“How did I raise a daughter who always follows the rules?”

“Because I have a mother who doesn’t,” I muttered.

“Damn right.” She cackled. “And who has more fun?”

I didn’t bother to answer because she lived the life of a much younger

woman. My mother had a busy dating life, took trips on a whim, and loved

to bar hop. Usually on my dime because she’d sacrificed so much for me to

get to this level. “Guess, I’ll take on an extra shift since I won’t have any

plans. I’m sure someone wants to be with their family on Thanksgiving

since mine don’t. Might as well earn some extra money and favor by

working.”

“Or you can get a life. Don’t make me feel guilty because I want to

enjoy mine. I did invite you,” Mama replied crossly. “You don’t need the

money, Brooklyn, and they need you too much to fire you if you call off. As

long as you allow it, they’ll keep demanding more and more of you until

you break.”

“Um...Ma, they're paging me. I got to run.” I quickly clicked off the

cell. Her tone meant a long lecture about how my life had become a cliché

of all work and no play. She didn’t understand that I wasn’t her. I loved my

job, and I didn’t attract men simply by existing as she did. At heart, I was a

proud, introverted nerd who preferred a quiet night at home, curled up with

a book or watching a football game on TV, over a night out on the town,

especially after my last disastrous relationship. Solitude and peace had

become my new best friends.

“I think we have the same problem, New York.”

His deep voice opened my eyes. Carter sat at the table next to mine. His

back faced my right side, and he looked over his shoulder to address me.

This close and relaxed, Carter was even more handsome, especially when

he stood to straddle the chair to face me, resting his black and gray bearded

chin on the top of the chair.

Like we were in high school in the cafeteria, and the popular jock

wanted the quiet, nerdy girl’s attention.

Willing myself not to flee from the flirty intensity of his gaze, mustering

my inner confidence, I replied, “What problem would that be? An annoying

mother?”

He chuckled. “That, too.”

“Too?” I frowned slightly.

“I don’t have plans for Thanksgiving either.”

My head jerked slightly. “Really? That’s surprising.”

“Why?” Carter’s eyes twinkled, assessing me.

“I mean...you’re you.”

He wryly asked, “And who’s me?”

“Like you’re this NFL star with a family.”

“Former NFL star who has two families and neither wants me there,”

He said ruefully. “Okay, maybe my children want me there. Their mothers,

not so much.” Carter gestured behind him. “You saw Exhibit A.”

“So not together?” I hope the hopeful flutter in my stomach didn’t

reflect on my face.

Something strange has been happening in my apartment for three months.

I live alone, I’m 28 years old, female, single, and I rarely have visitors.
I live only with my dog, a small Spitz. He doesn’t react much — he barks occasionally during the day, which is normal for the breed. He never barks at night.

Now to the reason for this post.

I collect Harry Potter figured/merch, The Witcher figures, and NECA/horror figures like Pennywise, as well as swords from the Witcher. These figures mean a lot to me and collecting them is something I truly enjoy. I love fantasy and horror.

I want to emphasize that I’m not your typical “nerd or freak” haha — not that it influences your opinion on helping me - I just want to make sure no one thinks I’m imagining things because I’m too deep into fantasy or something like that, haha.

So — in mid-October, my Dobby figure from Schleich went missing from my shelf. It was my first Dobby figure, a gift from my sister, and it meant a lot to me even though it only cost €12.

I couldn’t explain where it went. No one had been over. My dog doesn’t play with anything. It’s just me and him. I completely tore the apartment apart — moved the couch, lifted the carpet — the figure was nowhere to be found.

My sister and friends laughed at me and said I was crazy, that I probably knocked it down or vacuumed it up by accident.
Fine — they’re probably right, I thought. Where else could it have gone?

I ordered the same figure again on Amazon, and everything went back to normal.

Weeks passed. Everything seemed fine, but in the back of my mind I kept wondering where that figure could be.

One evening, I turned on the TV and noticed another Dobby figure had its back turned toward me. I smiled and thought I was really starting to lose it. I turned the figure back around and watched my movie without thinking much of it.


Then this Thursday morning, I was sitting on the couch drinking my coffee when I noticed something else:
A picture frame on the shelf had been pushed completely to the left. My Lego Lord Voldemort figure was turned around with its back facing me, even though they always face forward. Next to the picture frame, a Geralt Funko Pop had fallen over and was lying face down on the shelf.

I got a really strange feeling.
I immediately called my sister. The evening before, I had jokingly shown her my shelf and collection again because it had become a running gag:
“Who took my Dobby? Have you seen Dobby?”

Now my sister started getting worried too. It’s really strange — like I said, I don’t have visitors, I’m home a lot, and I do NOT touch my figures. They are purely decorative.

I turned everything back around and tried not to think about it.

Today — same thing again. Except this time, the original Dobby — the one that had gone missing, which was then replaced by another — was turned around.

Guys, what the hell is going on here?
A poltergeist?
A jinn?

I’ve also been sleeping badly since this started. I’ve bought new blankets, new pillows, tried everything — even natural medication — and my sleep is still bad.

I was born Muslim, but I’m more of an atheist now.
Is this God’s punishment?
Did a religious jinn find me like: “lil bishhh let me show you how fast you’ll believe in Allah again muhahaha. 

Already talked to chat gpt that MF said I’m possibly sleep deprived and probably unconsciously moving stuff around or physics - wall moving, motion, shaking bla bla. 

What’s going on?
Has anyone experienced this before? 
Is it time for the psych ward or is something deeper going on?

The Wyoming Cowboys (9-2) host the Grand Canyon Antelopes (6-4) on Saturday, December 20, 2025, in a Mountain West Conference opener that’s as much a numbers game as it is a basketball game. Wyoming enters as 2.5-point favorites, and if you’ve ever seen a cowboy lasso a steer, you know this isn’t a pick you’ll second-guess. Let’s break it down with the precision of a statistician and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffee drinks.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Wyoming’s Numbers Are as Fluffy as a Laramie Snowbank

Wyoming’s offense is a well-oiled (or should we say, well-herded?) machine, averaging 87.9 points per game (35th nationally) while allowing a mere 71.7 points per contest. Their +16.2-point margin is enough to make Grand Canyon’s +7.2 look like a fiscal crisis. The Cowboys also outrebound opponents by 9.3 boards per game—imagine a vacuum cleaner with a college degree, and you’ll picture Wyoming’s frontcourt dominance.

Defensively, Wyoming isn’t elite, but they’re good enough to frustrate teams like a slow Wi-Fi connection. Their 88.3 points per 100 possessions defensively (105th nationally) suggest they’re not letting opponents glide through their defense like a hot knife through… well, Wyoming’s famous bison burgers.

Grand Canyon, meanwhile, is a team that plays like it’s in a training film for the NBA G League. They average a pedestrian 74.9 points per game (243rd) but defend respectably, holding opponents to 67.7 points per game (62nd). However, their three-point shooting is so abysmal (6.4 makes per game at 28.8%, 339th) it makes you wonder if their players practice free throws with their non-shooting hands.

Let’s dissect this Sun Belt clash with the precision of a coach’s halftime rant and the humor of a fan who’s had one too many sweet teas.

---

### The Odds: A Tale of Two Turnovers and Three-Pointers

The betting lines tell a story of conflicting strengths. South Alabama (-1.5 to -2.0) is favored by most books, but Texas State’s home-court magic (7-1 at San Marcos) keeps the spread tight. The total is set at 139-140 points, which feels about right—these teams shoot like a pair of caffeinated baristas. South Alabama averages 75.7 PPG, while Texas State allows 67.5, but here’s the twist: the Jaguars let opponents drill 6.1 threes per game, and the Bobcats *love* to chuck it up—4.8 made threes per contest. It’s like a pickup game at a coffee shop: everyone’s got a shot, but not everyone can hit it.

### The News: Chaze the Wizard vs. the Home-Court Curse

South Alabama’s Chaze Harris is on a tear, dropping 38 points in a recent overtime thriller. He’s the team’s wizard, conjuring 16.7 PPG and 4.9 RPG. But here’s the rub: the Jaguars cough up the ball 8.9 times per game—imagine a toddler with a balloon at a party. When they limit turnovers, they’re 8-2; when they don’t? A惨淡 1-3. Texas State, meanwhile, leans on DJ Hall (13.0 PPG, 8.2 RPG) and Adam Olsen (16.3 PPG), but their 3-4 record against .500+ teams suggests they’re the sports equivalent of a “meh” emoji. Their home dominance? A product

1praz2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1praz2q/when_did_you_become_your_own_worst_enemy/,When did you become your own worst enemy?,"Before I begin, I hope some of you managed to read my previous post, “Take 5 minutes to read… this might change how you live.” I have seen all your comments and I am thankful for those who shared or reflected. I truly hope those words helped your wounded hearts feel a little lighter.

I know this period is not easy. Results are being released. Semesters are ending. Many of us are quietly questioning ourselves, wondering if we are enough, if we will make it. So I want to share this with you. It is lengthy, but it might be exactly what you need to hear right now.

“Dear self, when did you start joining the chorus of voices that tear you down?

It is 2 AM. Your desk lamp is the only light in the house. Your textbooks sit open, another practice paper waiting. In a few hours you need to wake for school, but you push through the exhaustion. Then it happens: one wrong answer. Just one. And suddenly you are at war with yourself, criticizing the person who has been working until their eyes burn, the person who has traded youth’s freedom for a hunched back over endless pages.

You collapse into sleep during the day because nighttime is not yours anymore. You are carrying the weight of exams that everyone says will determine your entire future. Then someone criticizes you, just once, and you join them. You attack yourself for feeling the pressure, for not being bulletproof, for being human.

“Dear self, you are exhausted. You need to love yourself.

But I know what you are thinking: I cannot afford to be soft. My eyes cannot only hold daydreams. They need to see all the futures I am fighting for.
You are right. And you are also wrong.
Here is what I have learned: True self-love is not weakness. It is the foundation that keeps you standing.

We live under dark clouds: the pressure to outwork everyone, to achieve more, to never be enough. Academic rankings. Workplace competition. Social media comparisons that make you feel like you are losing a race you did not know you had entered. The weight of it all makes our hearts feel like they are about to break.

So when we say “love yourself,” people misunderstand. They think it means giving up. Being lazy. Making excuses.

It does not.

Loving yourself means acknowledging that you have been trying so hard. It means accepting yourself after genuine effort, even when the results are not perfect. It is not pretending everything is fine. It is giving yourself the emotional space to heal from what hurts.

Think of Simone Biles at the Tokyo Olympics. The greatest gymnast in history stepped back from competition, choosing her mental health over another medal. The world watched. Some criticized. But she knew something crucial: you cannot pour from an empty cup. She loved herself enough to say “not today,” and that decision did not make her weak. It made her wise.

Not every flower needs to be a rose. Not everyone needs to be extraordinary in the same way. If you are not jade but you force yourself to shine like precious stone, you will shatter under the pressure. Even the strongest athletes need rest and care before they can soar again.

But here is the truth we need to face: Self-love without boundaries becomes a trap.
I have seen it happen. We are so afraid of being harsh on ourselves that we swing to the other extreme. We call it “self-love” when we avoid challenges. We call it “self-care” when we refuse to grow. We turn temporary rest into permanent retreat.

Real self-love is not hiding from storms. It is building the strength to face them.
Think about it: If you use “self-love” as a shield against every difficulty, you will never discover what you are capable of. You will trade the pain of growth for the comfort of staying small. And one day, you will wake up and realize that protecting yourself from failure also protected you from becoming.

There is an old story about a boy named Fang Zhongyong, born with extraordinary talent. At five, he could write beautiful poems without any training. His father paraded him around town, collecting praise and payment from amazed crowds. But he never let the boy study or practice. By adulthood, Fang Zhongyong’s gift had vanished completely. He became ordinary, not because he lacked ability, but because comfort felt easier than growth.
Does that not tell us something? Should that not warn us?

So here is what authentic self-love looks like:
It is holding yourself when you are exhausted. Encouraging yourself when you are lost. And yes, pushing yourself when you want to quit. It is both the embrace and the challenge. The rest and the call to rise.

It is knowing when to say: “You have done enough for today. Sleep. Heal.” And when to say: “I know you are scared, but you can do this. Get up. Try again.”

What this actually means for tomorrow:
After you fail an exam, give yourself permission to feel disappointed. Cry if you need to. Then, when you are ready, start again.

When work overwhelms you, reward yourself. Buy that coffee. Take that walk. Then return to the challenge with fresh eyes.

When your parents compare you to your cousin who got into NUS Law, remind yourself: their path is not yours, and that is okay.
This kind of self-love does not make you weak. It makes you sustainable.

We need to understand something: Life is not a straight line where we constantly climb upward. You will fall. It will hurt. You will need to rest. And that is okay.
When you stumble, let yourself feel it. When it hurts badly, sleep. Let yourself recover.
Taking sick leave requires a doctor’s note. But loving yourself? That only requires your own permission.

Here is what I want you to try:
Tomorrow, when that critical voice starts, and it will start, pause. Take a breath. Ask yourself: Would I say this to someone I love?
If the answer is no, do not say it to yourself. Not today. Not anymore.

You replay conversations in your head, cataloging every mistake. You see someone else’s success and feel like you are falling behind. You work until you can barely think straight, then hate yourself for being tired.

Stop.

You are not behind. You are not failing. You are learning what it means to be human in a world that demands perfection.

“Love yourself.” I will see you tomorrow.
Tomorrow brings sunrise. It brings the bright heat of noon. It brings evening moonlight that will catch in your hair and remind you that you are still here, still trying, still enough.
Even on days when you do not feel like it, you are enough.

The textbooks will still be there. The challenges will not disappear. But you will face them as someone who has learned to be both ambitious and kind, driven and gentle, pushing forward while also knowing when to rest.
That is not weakness. That is wisdom.

That is how we survive. That is how we grow. That is how we become people who can weather storms without breaking, because we have learned to be our own shelter when we need it most.

So tonight, before you sleep: Look at yourself in the mirror. Not with judgment. Not with criticism.

Just see yourself. The person who has been trying so hard. The person who deserves kindness.

And say it: “I love you. I am proud of you. Tomorrow, we will try again together.”

You do not have to earn this love. It is already yours.

See you tomorrow, dear self. The sun will rise. And so will you.”

Thank you for reading until the end. If this helped you in any way, and if you know someone who needs to read this, please share it with them. Sometimes we all need a reminder that we are doing better than we think.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",2,1766225006.0,SGExams,1,1.0,False

**Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Old Dominion enters this Sun Belt clash as a 5.0- to 5.5-point favorite, per the bookmakers’ chaotic symphony of odds. DraftKings has them at -220 on the moneyline (implying a 69% chance to win), while Coastal Carolina sits at +185 (35% implied probability). The over/under is 145.5 points, with nearly even money on both sides. Translating this: Bookmakers expect a low-scoring, defensive grudge match, where neither team will embarrass themselves… unless they trip over their own shoelaces, like Appalachian State’s basketball team did last month (more on that later).

Statistically, Old Dominion’s offense (74.3 PPG) edges out Coastal Carolina’s defense (71.2 PPG allowed), but the Monarchs’ defense is a sieve—leaking 77.3 points per game. Meanwhile, Coastal’s defense ranks sixth in the Sun Belt, holding opponents to 37.4% shooting. Old Dominion’s opponents, meanwhile, shoot a blistering 44.0%, which is like letting a toddler loose in a bakery and expecting them to count calories.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Coffee, and One Weird Bowl Victory**  
Old Dominion’s recent 24-10 bowl victory over South Florida was less “gridiron glory” and more “Quinn Henicle’s college football version of a Heisman highlight reel.” The redshirt freshman QB rushed for 107 yards and two TDs, including a 51-yard game-sealer. But let’s not confuse past glory with present relevance—this is basketball, and Henicle’s now a footnote. What *does* matter: Old Dominion’s 4-0 home record this season, including a 22-point eruption from Ketron Shaw against James Madison.

Coastal Carolina’s lone Sun Belt loss came against Appalachian State, who beat them 67-49 in Boone. That game was so one-sided, the Chanticleers probably still hear the echo of Alonzo Dodd’s 25-point performance in their dreams. But Coastal’s defense *has* forced opponents to shoot 38.1% from the field this season—better than

This sucks so bad. I vaped before my pregnancy for 3 years and now I feel like Im going to pay for it the rest of my life. I could probably blow through 3 inhalers a month if I used it every time Im super short of breath but Im trying to ration them. Its a stuggle to get one to last a month.

Im so scared for when my belly is huge and Im short of breath on top of having bad lungs. My last pregnancy I had to take breaks just going up stairs and I felt like I couldn't do anything that raised my heartrate at all. I was on oxygen for the majority of my labor. There's some studies that suggest abuterol use slows uterine contractions and that might have contributed to my baby never dropping and my prolonged labor that ended in 4 hours of traumatic pushing that was getting me no where. 

I guess I'm just frustrated and venting. There's no cure for this. Im always so scared about the state of the world and a possible event that could prevent me from getting an inhaler.

1pranxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1pranxm/my_parents_threatened_me_to_not_become_orthodox/,My Parents Threatened Me to Not Become Orthodox. What Should I Do?,"So, this is going to be long. But, please bear with me.

I’m 20 years old right now, but this specific story took place when I was 19—in June 2025. As some additional background knowledge, by this point, I was away from home (out-of-state) at a summer pre-law program at my college. So, my parents didn’t have “direct” access to me when I was gone. But, nonetheless, I (still) live(d) with them back home—and I drove/drive my Dad’s car to college. 

I come from a Baptist background. Both in terms of family & personal belief. In fact, I was baptized at a local youth church on my college campus on Easter Sunday 2024. But, very shortly after, I began to see glaring errors in my theological & ecclesiastical understanding. (At first, I thought, “Okay, perhaps high-church Protestantism resonates more with me?” Fast-forward a few months later, I was experiencing major anxiety deciding between the arguments of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. (This internal debating occurred over the span of multiple months—probably around 8-10) Nonetheless, I eventually settled on Orthodoxy as being the more “likely” position. 

One day at the program, I felt emboldened (partially by my parent’s absence) to attend a Divine Liturgy. At that, there was a particular parish I was eyeballing. I had an intuitive sense that my thoughts would be corroborated by attending, but I needed a real, authentic experience to repel any doubts I had. So, I went and made the hour+ drive. And before, I went, I had informed my Dad that I was trying out the Orthodox Church—and I gained his approval (this is important, remember this for later!). 

Once Liturgy was over (BY FAR the most astounding religious experience I’ve ever had, bar-none!), I called my parents and told them what an amazing time it was. How awestruck I was the whole time. At first, they were happy for my joyfulness. That is, until they began questioning me on what the service was like. They quickly realized that what I was describing wasn’t anything like the Protestant churches they were used to, but something more akin to Catholicism. I mention Catholicism intentionally—because my parents had ZERO indication of what Orthodoxy was whatsoever, but as soon as I mentioned terms like “father/priest”, “incense”, “iconography”, “saints”, “veneration”, “Eucharist”, they instantly recognized these terms from Catholic understanding. If it’s not evident already, my parents hate anything Catholic &/or Catholic-adjacent in practice. Then they began screaming at me. A lot.

I’m not going to detail \*everything\* that verbally transpired when they started raising their voice, but I was streaking in tears by the end of it. (To give you a rough idea, they began accusing me of renouncing Christianity, that I needed to repent of my sins, and that I must’ve underwent some trauma of some kind.)

My Dad then commanded me not to attend another Orthodox service until after law school was complete—(that’d be in approximately 4.5 years), and if he caught me participating in anything Orthodox-related in the meantime, he’d take away my car—among other various threats he made. From my vantage point, he said this out of fear. Mainly, fear of authority. He believes I’ve been “brainwashed” by predatory Church leaders to think I need to submit myself under a spiritual father; that I need to attend confession; that I potentially must be “re-baptized”, that I need anything else besides “faith in Christ alone.” And, I think he recognized that I had already mentally renounced Protestant doctrine, which led to the fear. (Just to be clear, I love my Dad—don’t get it confused. Although, this was certainly a rough time for us.) 

We didn’t speak for around a week after that conversation. And, I mentally decided that to avoid any further animosity between us, I wouldn’t bring it up for a while. 

Well, ever since then, to this day, I haven’t attended another Liturgy. And we haven’t talked about anything Orthodoxy-related since. When I returned home from that program, they immediately tried taking me to various Protestant churches near our area (they hadn’t done so like that in years). It was evident, albeit unspoken, that they were trying to “bring me back to the light.” But, internally, I knew, and still know—that Orthodoxy is what my soul needs for nourishment and healing. I have too many sins that I need to confess, too many internal demons that I need to be set free from! 

Now, I don’t consider myself Orthodox in any capacity. But, I certainly can’t consider myself a Protestant any longer. I don’t know what to call that intermediary point—but it’s certainly uncomfortable.

I purchased an Orthodox Prayer book at Coffee Hour that day at the Liturgy, but in full transparency, I’m too ashamed to pray from it. In many ways, I feel cowardly regarding this whole situation. Am I? Please help. 

In short, thank you for reading. I look forward to hearing from any of you who have honest advice regarding my particular predicament. God bless. ",8,1766223746.0,OrthodoxChristianity,5,1.0,False
1prann6,https://youtu.be/XtAEkgqH3rk,4 Very Scary TRUE Remote Island Lighthouse Horror Stories,"# ""Little Ross"":

My father and I took our small boat across the water to Little Ross Island, as we had done many times before. It was our quiet place, somewhere we escaped to for picnics and calm afternoons away from the town. The island was small and rocky, with patches of grass that flattened under the wind, and the lighthouse stood tall at its centre, white against the grey stone, guiding ships through the Solway Firth at night.

That August day in 1960, nothing seemed unusual as we set out. The sea was calm, the sky pale and clear. We planned to eat our sandwiches, sit for a while, and be back home in Kirkcudbright by evening.

As we neared the shore, though, something felt wrong.

Usually, one of the lighthouse keepers would notice us long before we tied up. Hugh Clark, the principal keeper, often waved from above or came down to greet us, cheerful and talkative, always ready with a story about storms, ships, or the loneliness of the job. His assistant, Robert Dickson, was quieter—reserved, sometimes awkward—but polite enough.

That day, no one appeared.

The island looked deserted.

“Father,” I said as I looped the rope around a post, “where are the keepers?”

He shaded his eyes and looked up toward the lighthouse. “Probably busy inside,” he said after a moment. “Let’s go and see.”

We walked up the narrow path toward the cottages. The door to the main house stood unlocked, slightly ajar, which immediately struck me as odd. The keepers were careful men; they didn’t leave doors open. Father knocked loudly, the sound echoing against the stone walls.

No answer.

He pushed the door open, and we stepped inside.

“Hello? Hugh? Robert?” Father called.

Only silence answered him.

The room was neat—chairs pushed in, the table clean, everything in its proper place. A small birdcage sat by the window. Inside it, a budgerigar hopped from perch to perch, chirping softly, the only sign of life in the house. The sound felt wrong in the stillness, too cheerful for the emptiness around it.

“Check the other cottage,” Father said quietly. “I’ll look here.”

I crossed to the second building. Its door, too, was partly open. Inside, the beds were made, clothes folded carefully at the foot. There was no sign of a struggle, no disorder—just absence. As I stood there, a sound cut through the quiet.

A telephone.

It rang and rang, sharp and insistent, echoing through the building with no one to answer it.

I ran back to Father. “The phone’s ringing,” I said, breathless. “But there’s no one there.”

His expression tightened. “Come on.”

Together, we went to the principal keeper’s house. The phone stopped ringing just as we entered, leaving behind a heavier silence than before. In the kitchen, the signs of interrupted routine were everywhere—washed pots drying on the rack, a mug on the counter, half full of tea, now cold.

“Hugh?” Father called again, louder this time.

No reply.

We moved down the short hallway to the bedroom. The door was closed. Father hesitated, then slowly turned the handle and pushed it open.

A man lay on the bed beneath the covers. His head was wrapped in a towel, as if he’d been unwell or trying to sleep off a headache. For a moment, I thought he might stir.

But the towel was stained dark.

Father stepped closer. “Hugh?” he said softly.

There was no movement.

He touched the man’s shoulder. Still nothing. Then he gently pulled back the towel.

I wish I hadn’t seen it.

Blood, dried and dark, soaked into the pillow. A small, terrible hole marred the side of Hugh’s head. His skin was pale, his eyes closed, his face slack in a way that told me instantly he was beyond help.

Father recoiled. “Don’t look,” he said sharply. “Go. Go get help. Run to the shore and signal any boat you see.”

My legs felt weak, but I did as he said. I ran, heart pounding, every shadow suddenly threatening. At the shoreline, I waved frantically at a lobster boat working nearby. The fishermen noticed and came over.

“What’s wrong, lad?” one of them asked as they tied up, his voice suddenly serious.

“Something bad’s happened,” I said. “My father found Hugh. He’s not moving. Please—please come.”

They followed me up the path. Father met us at the door, his face pale. “He’s dead,” he said quietly. “Looks like a gunshot.”

The fishermen went inside with him. I stayed outside, sitting on a rock, my hands trembling. The island felt different now—smaller, closer, as if the rocks and grass could hide someone watching us. I couldn’t stop thinking: *What if whoever did this is still here?*

After a while, one of the fishermen came out. “We’ve called the police,” he said. “Stay put. Don’t touch anything.”

While we waited, Father sat beside me. “It’ll be all right,” he said, though his voice lacked conviction.

“Where’s Robert?” I whispered. “Do you think he—”

“We don’t know,” Father said quickly. “It might’ve been an accident.”

But even then, I knew it wasn’t.

Hours later, the police arrived by boat. They asked us what we’d seen, took notes, and searched the island thoroughly. In one corner of the house, they found a .22 rifle hidden under a blanket. It smelled recently fired. There were no signs of a struggle. Hugh must have been asleep.

They searched everywhere—behind rocks, inside the lighthouse, up the spiralling stairs to the lantern room. The light was off. The sea stretched empty in every direction.

In Robert’s room, they found a note.

*Can’t take it anymore. The quiet drives me mad.*

Nothing else.

Before leaving, Father and I fed the bird and locked the doors behind us. As our boat pulled away, I looked back at the island. The lighthouse stood silent, a lonely sentinel guarding a terrible secret.

Robert was found days later in Yorkshire. He had taken a small amount of money and fled. In court, he barely looked up as he spoke. He blamed the isolation, the arguments, the endless quiet. He said it broke something inside him.

They sentenced him to death, later reduced to life imprisonment. He took his own life not long after.

The lighthouse was eventually automated. No keepers returned.

I never did either.

Even now, whenever I see a lighthouse, I think of Little Ross—the empty rooms, the ringing phone, the towel stained with blood—and I remember how silence, when left alone long enough, can turn deadly.





# ""The Unlit North"":

I live in a small town on the edge of a great lake, the kind of place where the water shapes your days and the lighthouse shapes your nights. Folks here trust that beam like they trust the sunrise. When it shines, ships find their way home. When it doesn’t, people notice.

That was why Tom came knocking at my door one morning, his face tight with worry.

“Have you seen the north light on Grand Island?” he asked. “It’s been dark nearly a week now.”

I shook my head. “That’s not right. Those keepers don’t miss a night.”

By midday, Tom and I had gathered a couple more men from town—Bill and Fred—and decided to row out and see for ourselves. The lake was calm, almost glassy, the oars dipping in without resistance. Still, the closer we got to the island, the heavier I felt, like something unseen was pressing down on my chest.

The lighthouse rose from the rocks ahead of us, tall and silent. No smoke from the chimney. No movement in the windows. No keeper standing watch.

We tied up at the dock and stepped ashore. The first thing I noticed was the supplies—crates and sacks stacked neatly near the landing, as if they’d just been delivered and then abandoned.

“Look at this,” Bill said, nudging a torn sack of flour with his boot. White powder spilled across the boards. “They didn’t even bring it inside.”

Fred frowned. “That’s not like them.”

We followed the path up to the keeper’s house, attached to the base of the lighthouse. The door wasn’t locked. That alone set my nerves on edge—keepers always locked up, if only to keep animals out. When I pushed the door open, the hinges let out a long, complaining creak that echoed through the empty rooms.

Inside, everything looked… orderly. Beds made tight. Dishes washed and stacked. For a moment, it almost felt foolish to be uneasy. Then I noticed a vest draped over the back of a chair. I lifted it, and a pocket watch slipped free, hitting the table with a soft clink, still ticking.

“This is Edward’s,” I said. “Why would he leave it behind?”

Tom was already sifting through papers on the table. He stopped, cleared his throat, and read aloud from a half-written letter.

“*Dear wife, things here are not good. The head keeper, George, has a bad temper. He shouts over small things, and I fear that if I speak up, something terrible may happen. Do not be shocked if you hear news of me found along the shore.*”

The room fell quiet.

Bill finally spoke. “Where are they?”

We searched the house room by room. In the kitchen, a pot sat on the stove, cold now, with old coffee grounds clinging to the bottom—as if someone had started a brew and never finished it. Upstairs, George’s coat still hung on its hook. His pipe lay on the nightstand, tobacco packed and ready.

“It’s like they just stepped outside,” Fred muttered.

That was when I suggested the boathouse.

On the way down, I spotted deep boot prints pressed into the soft dirt, leading toward the trees. The island was large and thick with woods, home to deer and watched over by a game keeper who lived miles off. He’d quarreled with the lighthouse men before, accusing them of taking game without permission.

The boathouse door stood open. Inside, one of the small boats was gone.

“Maybe they went out on the water,” Tom said.

“Then why leave everything?” I asked.

Bill bent down and picked up an oar lying on the floor. One end was darkened, sticky-looking. He touched it, then held up his finger. “That’s blood. Dried… but not old.”

My mouth went dry.

“We need to keep searching,” I said. “Tom, Bill—you check the tower. Fred and I will walk the shore.”

Tom and Bill disappeared up the spiral staircase, their footsteps echoing hollowly. Fred and I followed the rocky edge of the island, the water lapping gently at the stones. I scanned the shoreline for wreckage, for anything out of place.

Then Fred stopped. “There.”

He pointed toward a clump of bushes near the water. We pushed through the branches and found a shovel, half-buried in the dirt. Dark stains marred the blade.

“Someone’s been digging,” Fred whispered.

I dropped to my knees and pulled at the loose soil with my hands. It gave way easily. Too easily. My fingers brushed cloth.

“Fred,” I said, my voice barely steady. “Help me.”

We dug faster. An arm emerged. Then a shoulder. The body lay face down, the skull crushed so badly I had to turn away. The smell followed a heartbeat later.

“That’s George,” Fred said, shaking. “The ring—look. His wedding band.”

The woods suddenly felt closer, tighter.

From the lighthouse came a shout. Tom came running toward us, breathless. “We found the logbook! The last entry says, *‘Fight with assistant. He wouldn’t listen. Had to make him quiet.’* It’s George’s handwriting.”

Bill followed him, pale as ash. “There’s blood on the railing at the top of the tower.”

The pieces began to fit together in the worst way. George had attacked Edward—maybe killed him—and taken the body out on the lake. But then what had happened to George?

A branch snapped behind us.

I turned just in time to see movement in the trees—a tall figure, hat pulled low.

“Who’s there?” I shouted.

No answer. Another step. Closer.

Fred tightened his grip on the shovel. “The game keeper,” he said. “He’s hated them for years.”

“Or George isn’t dead,” Tom whispered. “What if that body—”

“It’s George,” I said, though my heart hammered. “But that doesn’t mean he was alone.”

“We need to leave,” I said. “Now.”

We started back toward the dock, but the path felt longer than before. Footsteps followed us, steady, deliberate. I glanced back and saw the man again, closer now, carrying something long—a shotgun.

“Run!” Bill yelled.

We broke into a sprint. Fred stumbled, but I hauled him up. The dock came into view just as a shout rang out behind us.

“You shouldn’t have come!” the game keeper roared. “They got what they deserved!”

The shotgun fired. Water erupted beside us as we shoved the boat free and rowed with everything we had. We didn’t slow until the island shrank to a dark shape on the horizon.

Back in town, we told the sheriff everything. A search was sent out, but the game keeper had vanished. George’s body was recovered where we left it. Weeks later, Edward washed ashore miles away, beaten and broken, just as he’d feared.

No one ever learned the full truth—whether George killed Edward and paid for it, or whether the game keeper settled his own score that day.

The lighthouse still stands, with new keepers now. The light shines again.

But I’ve never set foot on that island since—and I never will.





# ""The Watch"":

I took the job at the lighthouse because I needed the wages. There wasn’t much choice for a man like me. The Smalls sat miles off the Welsh coast, nothing but a jagged rock rising from the sea, barely wide enough for the tower and the narrow strip of stone that ringed it. No trees, no soil, no sound but wind and water. Once the boat left you there, the world felt very far away.

There were only two of us assigned to the light: me and Tom. He was older by many years, thick in the shoulders, his face weathered hard as rope. His voice was rough, always half a shout, and his temper flared quick, like dry oil catching a spark. From the moment we were left behind together, I could feel the tightness of the place pressing in—not just the walls, but him.

Our duty was simple enough. We were to keep the light burning every night so ships could clear the rocks and find their way. That meant endless climbing of the narrow iron stairs, cleaning the great glass lens until it shone clear, trimming wicks, hauling oil, wiping soot from every surface. Honest work, steady work—but the tower felt smaller with each passing day, as if the stone itself was leaning inward.

Tom never let me forget I was beneath him. He barked orders as though I were green, though I’d kept lights before.  
“Hand that rag here—proper,” he’d snap, wrenching it from my hand even when I was already passing it over.  
I swallowed my anger more often than not. There was nowhere to storm off to, nowhere to cool down. Still, sometimes my patience wore thin.

One evening we sat at the small table, the oil lamp between us flickering with every shudder of the wind. Supper was the same as always—bread gone stiff with salt air, fish packed hard in brine. Tom chewed slow, then glanced up at me with that familiar scowl.

“You polish the lens like a child,” he said. “If you leave streaks like that, we’ll have a wreck on our hands.”

I set my spoon down harder than I meant to.  
“I’ve done it right,” I said. “I’ve done it this way for years.”

His eyes narrowed. He leaned forward until I could smell the fish on his breath.  
“You don’t know half of what you think you do.”

Something in me snapped.  
“You act like you’re the only man alive who’s ever kept a light.”

For a moment I thought he might strike me. His face flushed red, veins standing out on his neck.  
“Watch your mouth,” he growled. “Or you’ll regret it.”

We stared at each other across the table while the lamp guttered between us. After that, the silences grew longer, heavier. The words we did speak were sharp-edged things.

Still, routine carried us. Up at dawn, down at dusk. Check the lamp, check the oil, mend whatever the salt and wind had eaten away overnight. The tower was stacked straight up like a chimney—sleeping quarters at the bottom, kitchen above, then storage, and finally the lamp room crowning it all. My legs burned every day from the climbing. Tom complained about his back more and more.

“This place isn’t fit for a man my age,” he’d mutter, pausing halfway up the stairs, one hand pressed to the rail.  
I’d nod, feeling the truth of it in my own bones.

Sometimes, when the sea was calm, we talked of home. He spoke of his wife waiting with hot soup, of a chair by the fire. I told him of my family on shore, of the village lanes and the sound of voices at night.  
“They worry about me,” I said once.  
He laughed, low and humorless. “They should. This rock could swallow us whole and never spit us back.”

The change came sudden. One morning the steps were slick with damp, and Tom was carrying a bucket down from the lamp room. I heard his foot go out from under him—a sharp scrape, then the sickening thud of flesh on iron. When I reached him, he was crumpled at the turn of the stairs, blood running from his ear, his breath coming in broken gasps.

“Help me,” he whispered.

I hauled him to the bed as best I could and bound his head with cloth. His skin burned hot under my hands.  
“Hold still,” I told him. “You’ll be all right.”

But he wasn’t. Fever took him. His words turned to murmurs, his eyes glassy and unfocused. I fed him water drop by drop, wiped his brow, spoke to him though he rarely answered. Once, he grabbed my arm with surprising strength.

“Don’t leave me,” he said.

“I won’t,” I promised, meaning it.

One night, the sound of his breathing simply… stopped. I shook him gently, then harder.  
“Tom,” I said. “Wake up.”

He didn’t. His eyes were open, fixed on nothing. I closed them with my fingers, and the room fell into a silence so deep it felt like the tower itself had died.

I was alone with him then—and trapped by the rules. If a man died, the body was to be committed to the sea. But I couldn’t do it. We’d fought too much. People knew it. If they found his body in the water, they’d say I’d pushed him. I told myself I needed proof. I needed to keep him until relief came.

The smell began slow, creeping, sweet and rotten. I covered him with a blanket, but it only trapped it. Each day it grew stronger. My appetite vanished. Sleep came in scraps. At night the tower creaked and sighed, and every sound felt like footsteps climbing the stairs.

I built a box for him with the spare wood and tools. My hands shook as I worked in the dim light, hammer blows echoing inside the stone.  
“This is for you,” I muttered, though my voice sounded wrong in my own ears.

Getting his body inside was worse. It was stiff, heavy, unwilling. When I finished, I tied the box to the outside railing where the wind might carry the smell away.

For a short while, it helped. I could breathe again. Then the sea rose.

A great swell slammed into the rock. I heard the crack before I saw it. The box had split, and Tom’s body hung half out, one arm torn free and dangling over the edge. The waves tugged at it, back and forth, back and forth, as if he were waving.

“Stop that,” I said aloud.

It didn’t.

After that, time lost its shape. I kept the light burning, though my hands shook so badly I spilled oil. I set two plates at meals without thinking.  
“Eat up,” I’d say, then laugh at the empty chair.

His voice lived in my head now. *You did this.*  
“No,” I’d argue. “You slipped.”

The nights were endless. The sea whispered, and sometimes it sounded like my name. I prayed, though the words tangled on my tongue. I went to the body again and again, though each time made me retch. Birds had pecked him. His skin darkened, loosened. His eyes seemed to follow me wherever I stood.

I began to see shapes in the corners of the tower, figures that vanished when I turned. My food ran low. Water too. I counted every swallow. The light above became the only thing that felt real—its steady beam cutting through the dark. Yet even that filled me with dread. What if a ship mistook that waving arm for a signal?

Weeks passed. Or days. I no longer knew.

Then, one afternoon, a horn sounded across the water. I ran to the gallery, waving, screaming. Men came ashore, their faces draining of color when they saw what remained of Tom.

“What happened?” one asked.

I tried to tell them. The words spilled over each other, broken and desperate.  
“He fell. I didn’t kill him. I couldn’t throw him away.”

They looked at me the way men look at something dangerous and fragile all at once. They wrapped Tom proper. They led me off the rock.

When the boat pulled away, I watched the lighthouse shrink behind us, the light still burning—steady, silent, unforgiving.





# ""No Flag Flying"":

I stepped off the boat onto the slick, uneven stones of Eilean Mòr, my boots crunching sharply in the damp air. The Hesperus rolled restlessly behind me, her hull knocking against the rock as if eager to leave this place behind. We’d battled foul seas for days, and Captain Harvie had finally decided to send me ashore first. As relief keeper, it was my duty to check on the men before the supplies came up.

I was no stranger to the island or its keepers. James Ducat, the principal, steady and dependable. Thomas Marshall, younger, good-humored. Donald McArthur—quiet, rough-edged, but reliable. Hard men, all of them. Men who knew this rock, knew the sea, knew how quickly things could turn.

Still, the moment my feet touched the island, something felt wrong.

I looked up toward the lighthouse as I began the climb—160 steep steps carved directly into the cliff face, slick with spray and age. No signal flag flew from the pole. No figure stood waiting above. The wind pressed against my ears, carrying only the sound of waves hammering the rock below. Three large black birds—cormorants, perhaps—sat perched near the path, unmoving. Their dark eyes tracked me as I climbed, heads tilting slightly, as if judging whether I belonged.

“Ducat!” I called, my voice thin against the wind.  
“Marshall! McArthur! It’s Moore—relief’s come!”

Nothing answered me. Not even an echo.

By the time I reached the top, a tight knot had formed low in my stomach. The lighthouse rose before me—tall, white, and closed tight against the gray sky. I laid a hand on the door before pushing it open, half-expecting it to resist. It didn’t.

Inside, the air was cool and unnaturally still, as though the place itself had been holding its breath.  
“Anyone here?” I called again. My voice echoed up the spiral stair, coming back to me hollow and wrong.

The kitchen stopped me cold.

The table was laid for a meal. Plates held cold potatoes and chunks of meat, untouched, as if the men had risen from their seats all at once. One chair lay overturned, pushed back violently enough to land on its side. The clock on the wall had stopped, its hands frozen at a time days past. In the corner, a small canary chirped weakly from its cage—the only living thing in the room. The sound of it made my skin crawl.

I moved through the bedrooms next. Beds were unmade, blankets twisted and rumpled, as though the men had risen in haste, not bothered to straighten a thing. On the wall hooks hung two sets of oilskins—neatly placed, dry, ready. The third was missing.

“That’s not right,” I muttered.

No man went out here without his oilskins. Not unless something urgent had pulled him away. Something sudden.

My unease deepened as I climbed to the lamp room. The glass was spotless. The lenses polished. The wicks trimmed and ready, as if the men had expected to light the lamp again that very night. Everything was in perfect order.

Except the keepers themselves.

By the time I returned to the boat, my hands were shaking despite myself. I told Captain Harvie what I’d found—or what I hadn’t found.  
“No sign of them, sir. Place looks like they left in a hurry.”

His weathered face tightened. “We’ll search the island. Take the second mate and a seaman.”

Eilean Mòr offered nowhere to hide. It was nothing but grass, stone, and sharp drops to the sea. We spread out, shouting their names until our throats were raw. The wind stole every word.

At the west landing, we found the damage.

The iron railings were bent and twisted as if struck by something enormous. A heavy supply box lay smashed open, ropes and tools scattered like toys. This landing sat more than a hundred feet above the water, yet it looked as though the sea itself had reached up and clawed at it. Nearby, a massive rock—larger than a man—had been shifted from its place. Higher still, turf had been torn from the cliff face.

The second mate pointed to a length of railway track ripped clean out of its concrete base. “What could do that?”

I swallowed hard. “A wave,” I said. “A big one. Bigger than any I’ve seen.”

We searched every crevice, every narrow geo where a body might have been thrown. We found nothing. The east landing stood untouched, calm by comparison, as if the island had been struck from one side only.

As daylight faded, Captain Harvie made his decision. He would return to report, leaving me and three seamen behind to keep the light burning.  
“Do your duty, Moore,” he said from the boat. “We’ll send help.”

I nodded, though dread settled heavily in my chest as the Hesperus pulled away. That night, the lighthouse felt impossibly empty. The beds were too quiet. The walls creaked and groaned with every gust. Waves slammed the rock below like fists against a door.

I thought of Ducat—calm, thoughtful. We’d shared a pipe not long before. *This place tests a man,* he’d said with a grin. *But we keep the ships safe.*  
Marshall’s laugh echoed in my memory. *Don’t let the sea scare you, Moore.*  
McArthur, gruff and silent, but always there when work needed doing.

In the dark hours, I heard a sound—slow, scraping, like boots against stone. I sat up, heart pounding.  
“Did you hear that?” I whispered.

The seaman shook his head. “Just the wind.”

But it came again.

Lantern in hand, I went down the stairs, every step echoing too loudly. The kitchen was unchanged. The cold meal still waited. The overturned chair looked wrong, accusatory. I set it upright, though my hands trembled as I did.

What if they’d heard something too?  
What if the sea had called them out?

Days passed in a blur. We worked, we waited, and the emptiness pressed in on us. A slate was found with routine notes—weather, duties—but the last entry spoke of a storm on the 15th, fiercer than any before. Nothing after.

“They went out to secure the gear,” I said quietly. “And then…”

“All three?” a seaman asked.

“McArthur left without his oilskins,” I replied. “He must’ve run out to help the others.”

Nights were the worst. The lamp’s glow twisted shadows along the walls. The sea stretched black and endless beyond the glass. One night, a tremendous crash shook the tower, spray blasting high against the cliffs.

“Inside!” I shouted as we slammed the door shut and barred it.

“That’s what took them,” someone whispered. “A monster wave.”

When Superintendent Muirhead arrived days later, I showed him everything.  
“They were good men,” I told him.

He examined the damage carefully. “Ducat and Marshall likely went to the west landing first. McArthur followed without his gear. A great sea struck them.”

It was the only explanation that fit.

We left soon after. The light was later automated, the island abandoned to birds and wind. But I never forgot Eilean Mòr—the silent rooms, the frozen meal, the feeling of being watched. And sometimes, when I hear the sea rise at night, I still think of those men, taken in an instant by something vast and merciless.",1,1766223711.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

After years with Nespresso, I finally moved to a real espresso machine and bought a Meraki. I know these are completely different systems, but I wanted to properly learn espresso, and this felt like a good entry point.

I am running into a couple of issues and would really appreciate some guidance.

First issue is the portafilter. It screws in very hard. I need to use quite a lot of force to get it to the point where the handle is at roughly 90 degrees to the machine. If I stop earlier, water leaks around the portafilter. Even when I get it fully tight, I still see one or two drops of water. That might just be condensation, but I am not sure. Is this level of tightness normal, or should I be concerned about the gasket or alignment?

Second issue is the puck. I grind 18 g of coffee at grind setting 12 and pull 36 g out. After the shot, the puck is very wet and sometimes a bit muddy. Is that expected on this type of machine, or does it suggest a problem with grind size, dose, or technique?

Overall, I am mainly trying to understand whether what I am experiencing is normal beginner stuff and part of the learning curve, or whether it points to a mechanical issue with the machine itself. I am happy to learn and adjust technique if the machine is behaving as expected. I just want to rule out a fault early on.

Sorry if my terminology is off. I am very new to this and still learning the basics. Any advice or pointers on what to check first would be really helpful.",2,1766223436.0,espresso,11,1.0,False

*By Your Humorously Analytical NBA Oracle*

**The Odds: A Math Class You Can’t Skip**  
Let’s start with the numbers because, let’s face it, the Washington Wizards’ chances here are about as likely as a snowstorm in July. The Memphis Grizzlies are priced at **decimal odds of 1.16–1.22**, translating to an **85–89% implied probability** of victory. For context, that’s like betting on the sun rising while wearing a “This Is Fine” dog costume. The Wizards? They’re hovering around **4.6–5.56**, which means bookmakers give them a **15–18% chance**—about the same odds as correctly guessing your barista’s favorite album on your first coffee order.

The spread? Memphis is favored by **11–11.5 points**, which is generous even for a team with **nine players sidelined**, including stars Ja Morant and Zach Edey. The total is set at **233.5 points**, suggesting this won’t be a defensive masterclass.

**The News: A Medical Drama Unfolds**  
The Grizzlies’ injury report reads like a rejected script for *Grey’s Anatomy: NBA Edition*. Ja Morant (ankle sprain) is shooting **19.4% from three**, which is worse than my ability to parallel park. Zach Edey (ankle stress reaction) is playing hurt but still averaging a double-double—though “double” here might mean “double the disappointment.” Nine players out? The Grizzlies’ roster is thinner than a $2 gym membership.

Meanwhile, the Wizards are… well, they’re the underdog in a game where their only advantage is that **Memphis’ bench is shorter than a toddler’s attention span**. No news on Washington’s

I go to baby-mom yoga classes and after class we all grab a coffee and catch up. There was a new mom and her LO was about the same age a mine (6 months at that time). So naturally we connected over that.

But then she told me how her LO was already talking full words and sentences! The entire group was in awe of course! However the first obvious give away should’ve been the dead silent baby in the stroller. 

Apparently I’ve no critical thinking skills and immediately enthusiastically blurted out that I knew a colleague (who’s is a great child psychologist btw) that specializes in gifted children, and that they’d be very interested in this case. Of course the mom was thrilled as well, she had already researched and recognized the characteristics of giftedness  in her LO and was exited for a possible diagnosis. So I gave her my colleagues practice information, but I never saw the mom again after that.

Couple of weeks or so later I see my colleague at a conference and I ask about the talking wonder baby. They immediately chuckled and explained that the mom interpreted every “goo”, “ga”, “prrrt” and even an occasional melodic fart as a separate word. Stringing them together apparently counted as a whole sentence. We had a good chuckle about it. 

So now every time our LO farts my husband excitedly yells: “she’s talking!”, or “her first word, her first word!”. 

TLDR:  I got too exited by the idea of a talking baby, referred a mom to a specialist, apparently farts count as words. ",24,1766223344.0,NewParents,2,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Toronto Raptors vs. Boston Celtics: A Rivalry as Chaotic as a Toddler’s Playdate**

The Toronto Raptors (17-11) and Boston Celtics (16-11) collide in a high-stakes Eastern Conference clash, where the only thing more volatile than the betting line is the weather in Toronto in December. Let’s break this down with the precision of a surgeon and the humor of a stand-up comic who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The Celtics enter as slight favorites (-1.5) with implied probabilities hovering around **54.6%** (based on decimal odds of 1.83), while the Raptors sit at **50%** (odds of 2.0). The over/under is set at **223.5 points**, suggesting a fast-paced, shoot-first affair.

Key stats? Oh, where do we begin?

* **Toronto’s Fast Break Frenzy**: The Raptors lead the NBA in fast break points (19.9/pg), thanks to Scottie Barnes’ 4.1 per game. It’s like watching a cheetah in a 100-meter dash—until they trip over their own shoelaces (i.e., their 4-game home losing streak).
* **Boston’s 3-Point Juggernaut**: The Celtics rank second in 3s made (15.9/pg), with Derrick White nailing 3.3 per game. White’s recent performance? A career-high 33 points on 9 threes. If the Raptors’ defense is a sieve, Boston’s offense is the tsunami.
* **Injury Report**: Toronto’s missing RJ Barrett (knee) and Jakob Poeltl (back), while Boston’s Jayson Tatum (Achilles) and Ron Harper Jr. (knee) are out. Tatum’s absence is like losing the quarterback mid-game—Boston’s star-studded roster suddenly feels like a reality TV show cast.

---

### Digesting the News: Star Power and Squirrel Energy

The Celtics just steamrolled the Miami Heat 129-116, with White and Jaylen Brown combining for 60 points. White’s 9 threes? A performance so dominant, even the Heat’s fans were side-eyeing their own team. Boston’s 7-3 stretch has them shooting 49.2% from the field—think of it as a well-cali

between travel guides and cookbooks. 
Your sleeve brushing mine like a question
neither of us was brave enough to ask yet.

You reached for a novel at the same time I did. Our fingers colliding, a meeting 
Engineered by paper and fate
And a stubborn novel that refused to choose sides.

You smiled the kind of smile that lingers,
The kind that says I read the endings first
But I still hope to be surprised.
I laughed too loudly. The shelves forgave me.

We talked in whispers, as if the books were listening. 
Argued gently over dog eared pages versus pristine spines. 
Confessed favorite authors like tiny secrets,
Our coffee growing cold somewhere in the background.

When you asked me to stay a little longer,
it felt casual—almost accidental—
like the best things always do.
One more chapter. One more minute.

Outside, the world waited patiently,
but inside that bookstore. 
We were already writing something new
A first date with a soft spine,
A flirty margin note,
Snd a story that didn’t want to end at chapter one.”

Ending this year with an indie showcase has been amazing. Getting to experience games that I never would have touched before. This time Coffee Talk, a short visual novel-esque barrista simulator. There are incredible opportunities, then there are fun games. The six stories (technically seven) that this game tells are interesting. However, the gameplay itself is very straightforward and because of that boring until the challenge mode. I wouldn't say I was bored or disliked the game, more like it was very middle-of-the-road. The story is worth it to experience. The trophy experience could be missed, but is easy enough if you are looking for a quick trophy. The only not-as-great trophies are the waiting one hour on the latte art screen and getting to 50 successful orders in challenge mode. Overall, there is a market for this game, but it was not necessarily for me. I am glad to have it in my platinum list! Next up Gris! ",3,1766222883.0,Trophies,1,0.8,False

The first 3 hours of sleep was amazing that my husband said how surprised he was at how well she was doing. Yup we jinxed it.

Her arms flailed around and woke herself up 3-4 times overnight. So naturally whilst rocking her back to sleep, I looked up on Amazon for other transition sleeping bags to try whilst sleep deprived!!! Added everything to cart. I am willing to try anything!

I think she is also going through her sleep regression phase which does not help. This is equally bad as the newborn trenches!

It's really been a piece I've dumped a lot of stagnant and difficult energy into. I'd been to my bead store a few times to get parts and the manager wanted to see it when it was done. So I finished it, put it in my purse, and went to get beads for an Xmas gift. 

I was at the local bead store and the manager wasn't there, but I kept bumping into a lady. We got to talking about a strand of gemstone beads, and then our projects. I pulled my finished piece out, and she knew what it was without prompting. ""That's vesta""

I'd been hoping to meet a platonic gal-pal friend that I could seriously study astrology and chat with. I was rather stunned and also thrilled. We finished our bead purchases and went to go get coffee. We chatted for a couple hours, talking about how we both listen to the same podcast and our lives. She asked if I'd go 50/50 that strand of fancy gems we'd both been eyeing up.

I slept on it.

Anyways, we met again today and I've now got half a strand of opals.

1pra9lp,https://i.redd.it/83awc5l5tb8g1.jpeg,Wild Flight,"Another weekend, another whisky flight, another delve into the different things the world of whisky offers.  

\*\*Fragrant drops 50 yr Invergordan\*\*

\*\*Nose:\*\* cereal, vanilla, pastries, sweet bread, custard bread, profiteroles without chocolate just cream. Icing sugar. If you’ve ever held and smelled cereal grains in your hand, very much like this.

\*\*Palate:\*\* quite juicy, a bit prickly which surprises me given the age and ABV (46.2%). Feels more like lemon pastries now, maybe some cooked pear.  Subtle fruits but not overwhelming. Viscosity is ok but a touch thinner than I’d personally prefer. The juiciness hits first, but it lacks the body to carry it, and the prickle of the alcohol disrupts the cohesion for me. On the final sip it’s soft on the palate, gentle sweetness, it is getting better in the glass. I’ve waited like 50minutes+ already, maybe it needs longer?? Tasting more juicy now, a bit more viscous, and a bit more fruitiness is coming out. More pleasant, a bit more warning, I like this. 

\*\*Finish:\*\* not that long, some spice and bitterness linger, the fresh pastries and sweetness of the nose kind of disappeared. Yeah finish is too short and the flavors from the nose do not carry all that well.  Better as it’s been left longer and longer, the sweetness and cooked down pear pastry notes are now lingering more, and the alcohol prickle and bitterness are way more subtle.  This is quite unusual.  This may need further time in the glass to really show the best of itself. 

\*\*Rating:\*\* 5/10 - the nose promises some really nice notes, but they don’t really follow through, and by the finish they’re almost completely gone. Mouthfeel isn’t rich enough by far, it’s almost thin, and the finish is quite short.  You see 50yrs and, even if it’s a grain, you expect big things. I can’t see any justification for the price except for marketing reasons dictating a 50yr product should cost x amount. Underwhelming. Nose is by far the best but if the palate and finish don’t follow through it’s a bit of a problem. \*\*Note:\*\* what’s written above was before I tried again - it’s now more mellow, fragrant, there’s way better cohesion, sweetness and pastry notes are carrying to the finish, the bitterness has vanished.  Very enigmatic dram, the longer I wait the more I am enjoying it.  This might be one of those in which you need a bottle to really give a proper analysis of it.  Certainly grows in complexity, and keeps adding to itself as it sits in glass.  Really interesting, I’m not going to buy another dram because I’ll have to wait another two hours to get the most out of it, but this is a slow burner for sure, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a 7/10, 8/10 or even high given enough time in the class.  

\*\*Two stacks pillars of creation 2025\*\*

\*\*Nose:\*\* lime zest, citrusy, stewed fruits, I don’t know if it’s my imagination but wisps of peat/smoke, with a piney sort of smell? Definitely wisps of smoke, very nice undercurrent of smoke. Bit of funk and earthiness too. More like herbs, like lime and herbs combined which sounds like it would clash, but it’s actually really nice. 

\*\*Palate:\*\* very nice! Pretty thick, very juicy, but I’m getting a lot of strawberry here. There is alcohol prickle (at 57% not surprising) but it’s minor, and doesn’t really interfere with the flavors.  Some coffee now as well, dried fruits come on the back palate. A bit drying but I really like that, dried fruits, raisins but also spices too, baking spices (I don’t know their specific names), dark and dry, like a fruity coffee? Really juicy on first hit, alcohol prickle gone by second sip, faint woody/smokiness underneath which feels like it’s binding other things together. There is a thickness to it which I really like, but the alcohol still stands out a bit, and with a few more years you might smooth that out. Lot of potential here though. 

\*\*Finish:\*\* long, drying, a bit tannic but very satisfying.  Makes your mouth kind of want to go in for another sip.  Yep tannic an dry, it’s coffee and meat!? Almost like a dried, smoked meat? This must be my imagination. Lasts long, but it’s drying (though not bitter) and, whilst I love that, it’s definitely not for everyone.  I’m trying to take other things from the finish but it is pretty tannic. Not the best balanced, but by no means unpleasant, I actually really like this and think it shows huge potential. 

\*\*Rating:\*\* 5/10 - it would be higher except for the fact the finish is very drying, and the alcohol integration isn’t as good as it could be. Very interesting though, really juicy, then drying, herbal in parts, Smokey in parts, and actually pretty cohesive I feel like it sits well together. Certainly more to look out for. 

\*\*G&M Longmorn 1966 45yr\*\*

\*\*Nose:\*\* everytime I gone back to it it changes. First got leather, lots of leather and deep baked fruit in the background.  Then second time herbal, like noticeably herbal, almost like mentholated but not in the artificial throat candy way, like actual fresh herbs. With bits of fruit backing it up. Third time a dark sweetness, like hot treacle, and faint fruitiness.  I expected loads of upfront Sherry-related fruits, but they’re actually very subdued and in the background.  Leather keeps coming back in big waves as well.

\*\*Palate:\*\* medium viscosity, not that mouth coating to be honest. Dark. Very dark. Leather seems to be carrying over. Dark fruits, like cherry, it’s really heavy, almost dark forest gateaux like, black currant but with these drying oak tannins and spices enveloping it.  Interesting.  It is complex and quite hard to get my head around, but I’m not sure it’s particularly cohesive.  Still vibrant for its age, like not muted at all, but the development is a bit odd. I don’t have enough experience to say this definitely, but it feels like the cask has had a bigger say. Oak tannins and spice are more apparent as I keep drinking. Alcohol prickle too which is baffling at this age. Gets increasingly drying and tannic. I like tannic whisky, but this is really on the edge. Dark chocolate coming out a bit now, but very dark to the point of bitterness. 

\*\*Finish:\*\* it is long, but it is full of oak and spice and tannin and dark chocolate bitterness.  Honestly I want a bit more fruit, the oak is taking over the other flavors and, whilst it’s good, the balance is lacking in my opinion.  Never thought I’d complain about a 45yr Longmorn but here we are. The finish is really long, I’m still tasting it minutes and minutes later…but it’s tannic and oaky, so I’m not sure I want it to be. 

\*\*Rating:\*\* 4/10 - the nose is phenomenal and far and away the best part of the experience. It promises so much but I feel like what we end up with is an uncohesive dram that is too overly oaked. If that nose wasn’t as good this would be a 3/10. Can’t believe I’m saying this. You get other flavors, but they’re always competing with the drying, oak spices, and they’re always losing.  I feel like I’m being a prick, but at this age, this price, I would have expected something far more well-rounded, cohesive, and better integrated. I could forgive this if it was a new distillery - in fact I’d praise it for what it offers - but for where it sits in the whisky world it has to do a lot better in my opinion.  

I am intrigued by that Invergordan, it seemingly took an age to show quality, and I feel like it would show more.  My favorite of the flight by the end, but an overall unusual flight which completely subverted the expectations I had.

As time went on we began talking, I invited him to my church and he started doing better and met, let's call her Christy, Christy. They moved in together and I had high hopes for the both of them. She was a beautiful young woman 13 years his junior. I thought well this should keep him busy and his mind off drinking. As time went on and I got more familiar with them both we became friends and I even stayed with them about a week one time when I was waiting on an apartment. We sat around playing cards and drank a few beers but all was well and a good time was enjoyed by all. Now fast forward 10 years. Jeff and Christie have moved in with her, what can only be described as delusional, mother and her chronically jail bound brother after her, and the only sane one in the family, father passed away! I swear I never would have believed that this beautiful girl had grown up among such ""people""! It shouldn't be so surprising then that she has a son by a previous marriage that beats his girlfriend to the point that she lost their baby! He is presently jailed and prison bound, thank God! Well her mom gets committed to a long term care facility after the ambulance is called for her acting strangely and method was discovered in her system, a lawyer was appointed for her, started getting her social Security checks and liquidating her property to  satisfy her bills. Here's where I come in. The house was sold and they needed a place to stay for ""a couple of weeks"" till they could move in another apartment.

When they weren't doing drugs or getting drunk off their ass they were calling each other names that would make a sailor blush, hitting one another and screaming at each other at the top of their voice. The Police were called 3 times, my home and my nerves were a wreck, their was no food in the cupboard and nothing but water to drink unless I provided it. I'm still trying to figure out how the two of them managed to use over 40 rolls of toilet paper! The only good thing, if you can call it good, was he would get high on method and clean up their mess from the previous night. My floors have been mopped so much that the tiles have lost their color and something, I can't stand, is for someone to come in and start moving MY shit around to ""straighten up""! I admit, to the ordinary person my coffee table and bedside tables in my home look like a mess but I KNOW WHERE EVERY SINGLE THING IS! THIS IS MY FILING SYSTEM! I have notes written, phone numbers, passwords, people's names, appointments, schedules, IMPORTANT SHIT everywhere that it will now take me months to find, if ever, and all I got was ""sorry"", well you dumb son-of-a-bitch you should have asked! It all came to a head when after yet another visit from the   PoPo that I was approached by the other homeowners and given an ultimatum. Either they go or I do, and they meant TODAY! It was a mixed message in so far as I don't like to be threatened, BUT, it gave me the motivation and the excuse I needed to finally rid myself of two pests I should have done something about the second day. The entire time all they offered was $50 for the privilege of turning my life upside down and I was never so happy to see a ""friend"" leave!!!",1,1766221747.0,AboutAllRelationships,0,1.0,False

I dropped my ex best friend about two months ago and he reposts stuff about me about missing me but I am nervous I didn’t make the right decision.

Growing up, I was walked all over. One thing about me now is that I do not play when I am walked over, Everyone has their points. I became friends with this man, let’s call him Eli for now. Me and Eli first started becoming friends in September 2024. I first met him in January of 2025. 

From then on, we were inseparable. We quickly grew close and to fill you guys in, I am a homosexual man. He is a straight male. One of the first things he called me was the f slur to try to talk to me. Why? I don’t know. Anyways I let it slide and we grew closer. Eventually we started seeing each other weekly and I would buy him coffee when we would hang out.
After about three hangouts, I told Eli jokingly he was gonna start paying for coffee and he straight up said no. That rubbed me the wrong way. As we grew closer, Eli confided in me to tell me that he has had gay allegations. People would accuse him of being gay and he would say he wasn’t because he claims he isn’t. To add onto this, over the previous summer, Eli lost his V. to a woman, but he didn’t finish. Shortly after Eli telling me all of this, he told me how he also had a gay interaction with another gay male. I chose to look past it because I started to fall for him. Throughout February-May, we decided to go to the same college and even live with each other. It was a time! 
During the summer as well we grew even more closer and started cuddling and I would massage his back. Once we got to college, Eli grew increasingly clingier with me. He would lay in my twin sized bed and even sleep in the bed with me. One night we were cuddling and Eli got hard mid-cuddle. We were playing with each other’s waistbands when we went lower for each other. I went farther for Eli and asked for consent which he said yes, then once I asked again he asked me to stop, which I did. Eli got embarrassed after and eventually asked me to finish him off to which I did because I had feelings for him. After that, it became an every night thing. 
We progressed from the hand, to the mouth, to full on gay intercourse. Throughout this after Eli would finish inside me, he would help himself feel straight by saying he needs a girlfriend, after finishing inside me and essentially using me. He knew intercourse meant a lot to me. During this I started to distance myself so I would not get my feelings hurt. 
One night we went to our friend’s place and he accepted several drinks even though he drove me. The thing is, Eli knew my dad had driven under the influence years ago, which has left me traumatized. Eli picking up that drink was my final straw. After then on, I decided to distance harder. I stopped reaching out, got quieter, and worried about myself. During this Eli noticed. Eli would ask if I was okay and try to get in my bed, and even though I would say no, Eli would ignore it. It would bring up underlying trauma that nobody knows about. From then on, I completely stopped reaching out and talking. 
During this, I felt uncomfortable living in my own room. I would be laying down and Eli would be staring from his bed. Along with that, Eli also got drunk and urinated in my trash can. After that, I removed him from my tiktok streaks and I removed him from my instagram spam. Me and Eli don’t talk anymore but he has over 50+ reposts on tiktok about how I put him in a dark spot and he misses me. Here is where it gets interesting: over the course of our friendship, Eli would show jealousy if he knew that I was talking to other men. 
Eli also made a joke regarding my dad’s alcoholism. He also never offered to pay anything. For example, he bought me coffee twice while I had bought it for him over ten times. He works and I do not anymore. Another example is that we needed a lamp for our dorm, which was our idea, and I paid for it myself with my own money. I tried to voice that I’m paying for a lot of our stuff by myself and he wasn’t helping and he didn’t seem to care. I also would constantly buy us alcohol, in which he would never pay me back. I spent easily over $300 on it to which he never paid a dollar for it but would ask to drink it. He also told me he was having intercourse with me for me, if that makes sense. The list goes on and on, but it’s the same idea. 
While I do feel bad, I feel like leaving without explanation was the right decision. He knew about my history of getting walked over and he did the same thing. Am I the asshole?",0,1766221443.0,AITAH,4,0.33,False

1pra2p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/scavengerhunt/comments/1pra2p5/rehearsal_dinner_scavenger_hunt_was_the_highlight/,Rehearsal dinner scavenger hunt was the highlight of our wedding weekend,"Just got married last weekend and wanted to share a scavenger hunt success story!

**The Setup:**
Created a hunt for our rehearsal dinner to help our families (who hadn't met much) get to know each other. Mixed teams of 5-6 people - his family + my family together.

**The Route (downtown, ~90 minutes):**
- Where we got engaged (photo challenge)
- His favorite coffee shop (trivia about us)
- My favorite bookstore (find a book rec for the couple)
- Mural we love (team photo)
- Our first date restaurant
- Park where we walk our dog
- Ending at dinner venue

Everyone used their phones to navigate and solve clues.

**What Made It Work:**
✅ Families bonded naturally instead of forced small talk  
✅ Competitive energy kept it fun (my dad is VERY into winning)  
✅ Great photos from all the teams  
✅ Groomsmen/bridesmaids got to know each other  
✅ People learned about our relationship organically  

**The Surprise:**
People still talk about the hunt more than the actual wedding reception! My MIL said she learned more about us in those 90 minutes than months of conversations.

**Logistics:**
- Platform: Scavenge.rs (free tier, phone-based)
- Created it in ~2 hours
- Weather backup: had indoor version ready
- Made sure route was accessible for grandma
- Cost: $0

**One Hiccup:**
One team got lost and showed up 20 minutes late... but they still won 😂

**For Anyone Planning Something Similar:**
- Perfect for mixing groups who don't know each other
- Weather dependent (have a backup)
- Test the route if possible
- Consider mobility needs
- Keep teams balanced (mix ages/personalities)

The hunt created stories and inside jokes that carried through the whole wedding weekend. 10/10 would recommend for any celebration where you want people to actually interact!

I have the usual bloating/cramps but for larger meals it can turn into strong stomach aches. Been rotating between the Lactaid variations for a long time. I started years ago with Lactaid Original (3000 FCC) and these days I mostly use Lactaid Fast Act (9000 FCC). Honestly though, they’re just not that reliable for me anymore. I’ve stuck with Lactaid mostly because it’s been around forever (30+ years), and I’m generally skeptical of newer brands.

Recently, I noticed a new lactase enzyme product on Amazon with 18000 FCCs (!). It has no reviews yet, which would normally be an automatic skip for me. What caught my attention was that it appears to be the #1 lactase brand in German pharmacies (they're called ""Lactrase""). That + my occasional frustration with Lactaid made me try it as it might be a better (""German"") Lactaid-type brand.

I’ve been using it for \~a week now with pretty standard tests (e.g. milk in coffee and a cheese pizza) and honestly it worked better than I expected. I also like that the 18000 FCC tablets can be split in half if I just want the regular \~9000 FCC dose.

A few notes:

* Tablets are roughly the same size as Lactaid's caplets, maybe a tiny bit smaller
* Pricing is a bit premium, especially compared to the cheaper knock-offs in Target, Walgreens, and so on. But it's Made in Germany and you are getting quality in return
* No side effects so far (for me)

Obviously this is just one person’s experience, and I know everyone’s tolerance level is different. It’s brand new on Amazon, but it seems like it’s been around in Europe for a while. So far it ticks the important boxes of being a legacy brand + being reliably effective.

If you’re someone who likes trying new options (especially European brands) making their way over it might be worth keeping an eye on. I'm also curious if anyone else here has tried it yet.",1,1766221229.0,lactoseintolerant,0,1.0,False

I did actually do their reviews on their respective days, but had other stuff going on and didn't get them posted until today. But. With this I will now be up-to-date again.

So, Balcones Rye SBBP. This bottle is a store(?) pick from the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park Colorado. I did get to taste this before buying and I remember it being really tasty and surprising for a bottle from Balcones (the only other Balcones I remember having I didn't love). This is my second bottle coming in at 64.9%, so it will also end up at around 16.2% after mixing 4:1 with eggnog.

Here's my review of this bottle. Neat!

Nose: rich chocolate truffle, maple syrup, cinnamon. Kinda gives a Mexican hot chocolate vibe. A hint of mint.

Palate: very malty. Coacoa powder or like semi-sweet chocolate chips. Coffee, like a super fruity coffee. Super intense. The fruitiness that I associate with the coffee is definitely more red fruit. Like cherry, and kinda raisiny.

Finish: fruity coffee carries the rest of the way and lasts for a while.

This one is super interesting, unlike any other bottles I can think of, and incredibly delicious. Coffee isn't always a flavor I'm going to want from a whiskey I think, but what this brings us undeniably intense and delicious. 93/100

I'm very excited to see how this will do in eggnog, so let's dive in!

The nose is super chocolatey and the cherry/almond also feels pretty dialed up from usual.

This drinks like chocolate eggnog. It is so good! It also gives a bit of, like, the milk left over after eating chocolate cereal or something. A bit malty. Very tasty.

1pr9xsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTurkey/comments/1pr9xsi/relationship_advice/,Relationship advice,"I'm a 27 year old British woman dating a 26 year old Turkish man. We meet up in person fairly regularly, but I do have to keep going back home in between for a bit of context. Dating two years.

My boyfriend spoke to me briefly about a woman at his work and I didn't think anything more about it. But he has been messaging her daily since around September time. He will wish her good morning and goodnight, will ask her what she's doing throughout the day and exchange photo messages with her. There was one flirty message, but overall nothing explicitly flirty, however I'm not a person who can read between the lines due to my autism. Around this time, I remember asking him if there was a problem between us because something felt different. When I spoke to him he said he'd not done anything wrong and there were problems at work, so that's why he was messaging her regularly so she wouldn't leave the workplace and there'd be more work for him to do until they recruit and train someone else. He said there was no emotion behind it, however none of the messages were work related and he tried to initiate meeting her for coffee. The messages reminded me of how I used to communicate with him in the early stages of getting to know him. 

I don't want to sabotage my relationship over something that is meaningless. After all, there was no explicit flirting. But in my eyes, I tend to only behave in a conversation like this when I have an interest beyond friends with someone else. I probably would reserve good morning messages for someone I really like. Is it normal to look after female coworkers in this way?

Thank you in advance.

TL,DR Boyfriend messaging another woman, nothing overtly flirty but J have an uncomfortable feeling.

EDIT: I should probably add that there was a dating app on his phone. He claimed this was for his friend he lived with who didn't have a smartphone. He had such a look of honesty in his eyes that I stupidly didn't question further or ask to see the profile, but now it's deleted.",6,1766220822.0,AskTurkey,34,0.88,False

I started working there about 8 months ago and my coworker May (60sF) started working there a couple of months after I did. I work night shift and after a few weeks of her working there our manager started putting us together on night shift. When May first started working there I was nice to her and would occasionally help her figure stuff out because she was still kinda new and didn't know how to do everything. As far as I knew we got along well

One day our manager pulled me aside and asked me if I was actually helping other coworkers with chores during night shift. Because apparently according to May when we work together all I do is stand behind the counter and do nothing while she does everything. Our assistant manager confirmed to me that it was her who told our manager that. But even before she confirmed that it was May I already knew because before I started working with her I worked with 4 other people on night shift and never had an issue and the amount of work that I do had never been questioned until I started working with her

I didn't say anything and just left it alone. There's a cute guy that comes into our store and gets ice all the time and he has a crush on me everyone knows about him including May. A couple of days after our manager confronted me he came in and started talking to me. May interrupted our conversation and said ""Oh you should come in everyday because you're the only one who can make her wake up and do something"". He just gave her a weird look and ignored her and went to get his ice. Even as he was ignoring her she kept trying to talk shit about me to him

After that I decided to keep my distance and not talk to her unless absolutely necessary. The next time I came into work I wasn't there any longer than about 45 minutes and most of that time I was doing work outside while she was working inside. When I came back inside I answered a question for a customer that she was ringing up and she got upset and said ""Oh so you can talk to her but you can't talk to me?"" and stormed off to the back

After that I found out that quite a few of our other coworkers don't like her including our assistant manager because she likes to micromanage people and act like she's the one in charge and boss people around. She even tried to get another one of our coworkers in trouble for leaning on the counter while taking a break from cleaning. She's also been rude to a few customers even refusing to give one of our regulars a bag and telling him ""You should've kept the bag we gave you last time"". Also the reason why she lied on me to our manager is because she was mad because I wouldn't ""do as she said"". She wanted me to rush a customer out of the bathroom so that another customer could use it and not have to wait and she wanted me to show another customer how to use our coffee machine. I ended up making a video venting about the things that she did and how frustrating she was to work with and posting it on social media. My assistant manager saw it and didn't say anything and actually thought it was funny (this was about 3 months ago)

Earlier my coworker Tay (50sF) (who also doesn't like her) told me that a couple of days ago one of our regulars found my video and showed it to May and now she's upset and complaining to corporate about it. I told her that I don't care and she can be as upset as she wants because she shouldn't have started shit with me and lied on me to our manager. Especially when she breaks rules all the time like accepting packages that aren't addressed to us even though our district manager came in and told her not to or letting people use the bathrooms after they're supposed to be closed. Tay said that what I did was technically breaking the rules too and that I should've tried talking to her instead because some people don't like it when you run to the Internet

I said that there was no talking because she knew exactly what she was doing and tried to get me in trouble with our manager for basically no reason and when that didn't work she tried to embarrass me in front of the cute customer all because I wouldn't let her boss me around and even after that she was doing little petty and annoying things like purposely writing her numbers in my clearly marked column on the paperwork and interrupting me while I'm talking to customers and pretending like she doesn't know how to do basic simple tasks. She even got an attitude because I signed off on a repair when our managers weren't there even though the guy asked her first and she didn't want to and told him to ask me instead. Besides I didn't say what location she worked at and I wasn't wearing anything from work in my video and I did it during my personal time not work hours. So if someone put the pieces together and figured out it was her that's not on me

1pr9oye,https://www.reddit.com/r/snacking/comments/1pr9oye/does_anyone_actually_feel_different_after_they/,Does anyone actually feel different after they eat a Clif Bar that contains caffeine?,"I’ve been wondering about this a lot lately because I’ve been digging on the Cool Mint Chocolate Clif Bars and eating one every day. I like the flavor better than any of the others and it has nothing to do with the fact that they, along with Peanut Toffee Buzz contain caffeine. But the other day I noticed for the first time that on both packages of the flavors that contain caffeine, it tells you the amount of caffeine and that children under 18, pregnant/nursing women, and individuals sensitive to caffeine should not eat the bar. While I understand that they just want to make extra sure that you know it has caffeine before you eat it, there are plenty of things like coffee, tea, or energy drinks that contain way more caffeine but it isn’t emphasized so much on the nutrition label, nor does it say who should avoid drinking them. Again, I assume it’s a combination of the fact that most Clif Bars don’t contain caffeine so someone unfamiliar with all their flavors might not be aware of this, and also the fact that those beverages I mentioned above are pretty obviously caffeinated unless otherwise noted Decaf. But anyway, despite the sensitivity warnings on the Clif Bar labels, I’ve never had a reaction after eating one like I do when I drink coffee or Red Bull. I don’t think it’s enough caffeine to affect me personally but I’m wondering if it is for anybody else? I also don’t react after drinking a 20oz bottle of Pepsi which only has 23mg of caffeine so why even bother putting any in at all? I’ve also noticed that if I consume caffeine on a full stomach, I’m far less likely to be affected by it, similar to alcohol though less extreme. Maybe because Clif Bars are a bulky food to begin with, that masks the caffeine’s effects instantly after I eat them? I don’t for sure, but I’m curious if anyone else does?",2,1766219853.0,snacking,0,1.0,False

1pr9mfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/FTMventing/comments/1pr9mfx/hopeless_about_my_love_life/,Hopeless about my Love Life,"There's a woman I have feelings for at work. She knows I'm trans and she's very accepting, but the rest of the workplace sees me otherwise (thanks to the manager). She's a very bubbly extrovert and gets along with most people at work, and I could be too if I was viewed as my correct gender.

But I'm not. And when I'm not gendered correctly I reserve myself and barely talk. She was the one who sort of, melted the ice that I froze and I was getting slightly talkative (not as much as I usually am, but close enough).

I know some things about her bc she told me, but of course feelings are feelings and I care about her and want to get to know her even more, not just as a romantic partner but as a person. 

I ask her if she wants to grab some coffee (as friends, she don't know I'm into her). I was excited to hear what she's been up to and I wanted to tell her what I've been up to; we didn't get the chance to talk during break so, I was hoping for something. Then she mentions she's seeing a guy and that we can hang out someday later.

My rejection sensitivity is REALLY bad. But I also knew I wouldn't be spiraling as much as I'm doing now if she wasn't seeing someone. I tried asking her beforehand if she wanted to hang out a few months ago but she had extra shift that time. I was disappointed but understood that we weren't as close in our friendship back then and I wasn't out to her as well. Now? My heart is hurting since yesterday and I hate it. She's the type that goes with the flow; not very organized with respect to time and I've seen and heard it from other colleagues whom I asked how in the world I can hang out with her. And they always say *you need to be assertive to actually get a chance in her busy schedule*. I, am NOT the type to push people constantly and I especially find that sort of gesture rude. So, I guess I'm fucking lost!

I started comparing myself to neurotypical cis men and I thought to myself how fucking easy for them to start and get a date with someone without worrying about breasts and lack of P or even the fucking height or just the relationship with families and identity and whatnot. I don't even drive in a car-centric country because it's hassle to my mind what with all the traffic and road ragers.

My crush is taller than me. Why the fuck would she want to be with a short not cis dude who doesn't drive? She has lots of friends, why would she want to spend time with me outside of work when she has tons of people who match her energy better? Why choose someone who doesn't even drive? She won't choose someone who can't give her kids. She won't choose someone who is not a man legally.

  
And please don't tell me to go meet new people yada yada. I'm trying my best to do that. But my brain and heart decided to go for someone outside my league and like a dumbass I still stayed true to it because she gave me life whenever she was around. The past few months I was like a dog getting excited to see his favorite person (YAY FOR ANXIOUS ATTACHMENT WOOOOOOOOOOOOO). 

  
Anyways I hate cis people. I hate feelings and I hate love and trauma and I fucking hate cars. Cheers everyone. ",3,1766219574.0,FTMventing,0,1.0,False

I will attend 8 social Meetup events and form genuine friendships with 5 new people, exchanging contact info and meeting them outside organized events.

# SECTION B: BREAKDOWN OF STEPS

Week 1: Join 5 Meetup groups (hiking, board games, book club), RSVP to 2 events this week, prepare conversation starters.  
Week 2: Attend 2 events, initiate conversations with 5+ people per event, exchange Instagram/phone numbers with 2-3 connections.  
Week 3: Attend 3 events (mix of groups), follow up with Week 2 contacts via text, invite 1-2 people for coffee outside Meetup.  
Week 4: Attend 3 final events, solidify 5 friendships through one-on-one hangouts, create group chat with new friends.

# SECTION C: EVIDENCE COLLECTION PLAN

1. Meetup event check-in screenshots — proof of attendance at 8 events with timestamps.
2. Text message screenshots (names redacted) — showing conversations and plans with 5 different people.
3. Photos from one-on-one meetups — 5 separate coffee/lunch meetings outside organized events (faces can be blurred for privacy).
4. Group chat screenshot — showing active conversation with minimum 5 new contacts.

# SECTION D: POTENTIAL OBSTACLES & SOLUTIONS

Social anxiety at events → attend with accountability partner first time, prepare 3 conversation starters, arrive 10 min early to ease in.  
People not following through → reach out to 10+ people to account for drop-off, don't take personally, focus on genuine connections.  
Schedule conflicts → prioritize weekends, block calendar every Saturday for Meetup events.

# SECTION E: PROGRESS UPDATE SCHEDULE

Updates twice weekly in comments: Days 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 25, 28. Share number of events attended, connections made, follow-up progress.

# SECTION F: DEFINITION OF SUCCESS

Complete when: 8 Meetup events attended (documented check-ins), 5 people met outside organized events (coffee/lunch photos), active text conversations with all 5 (screenshots), group chat created with new friends.",1,1766219448.0,FutureGoals,1,1.0,False

This addon was actually **requested by u/master_si** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/s/Iyf44vVhrh).

I got curious whether, based on my previous addon  [Docchi](https://github.com/skoruppa/docchi-stremio-addon) (anime with Polish subtitles), it would be possible to quickly build with help of a LLM a **new addon that works purely by parsing HTML** instead of using a nice API. 

It was a nice learning experiance!

## 🎌 Anime World India Stremio Addon

An **unofficial** Stremio addon that pulls anime streams from  
Watch Anime World India.
It does not require Debrid service as all streams are http based. 

It provides anime in:
- Hindi 
- Japanese 
- Tamil  
- Telugu  
- English  

audio + subtitles (not everywhere, not always :P) 

### What works:
- Multiple catalogs (newest, most watched, movies, etc.)
- Search
- Multi-season shows
- Subtitles (VTT / SRT)

In feature maybe I will impelent tmdb/imdb mapping. For now to watch something from there you need to use addon's catalogs/search

I’m in college and I know this is where I’m supposed to make friends and trust me I’ve tried but it really is not easy. I managed to make one college friend and we’ve gone out a few times and she’s great but the thing is we’re not close and that’s just one friend. I’ve dreamed of having a big girl friend group and having people to always talk to (besides family) and having people to always hang out with and do different things with. I have technically barely 5 friends. And sure that could be plenty but it’s not a group and they’re all so different. (Not gonna get into that) and in terms of them. It’s just that sometimes they’re there for me but mostly I am alone. I have no one except my family to celebrate my accomplishments and share my doubts and fears with. And i know nobody is perfect but there are so many activities that I want to do and some of them I’ve gone and done alone because no one wants to do them with me. One friend has social anxiety and literally refuses to leave her house or basically do anything.. simply does not want to leave her house under any circumstance and every single hangout is just watching movies at her house), one only ever is with her bf, one moved away and we kinda fell off and the others always leave me on opened and never want to do ANYTHING with me. Also one of them who ik talks shit cheated on her partner and told me to cheat once and I’ve looked differently at her since. And maybe I shouldn’t be so picky with these friends and maybe that’s my issue but I just want genuine female friendships.

I’ve dreamed of going on a girls trip forever or girls trip to do literally anything anywhere. all of my friends take days to respond (sometimes will be left on delivered for weeks or just opened) and I’ve stopped asking people to hangout or suggest every kind of activity because the answer is always a no. Mind you I’ve known all these girls for years. I’m sorry to sound so damn selfish but I’m so lonely and tired of not having anyone to do literally anything with. I’m a pretty open person and I just want to do anything with anyone.. grab coffees, go to a workout class, go hiking, skating, golfing, take a pottery class, sip n paint, camping, clubbing,  literally anything except sitting at home.
