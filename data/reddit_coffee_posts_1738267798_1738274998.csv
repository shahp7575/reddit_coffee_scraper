My family in Poland had one and my friends in Iceland had another. I really enjoyed making the various different coffee styles during my extended visit overseas. But because of the cost I kept on pushing back on the ordering one. Since Christmas I been thinking about it again and saw there was a good deal on their website. Went ahead and ordered it. YOLO! I was so excited about it and it was supposed to be delivered two days ago. I understand things do happen so I was trying to be patient. Today I reached out to the shipping provider… only to find out that package was “damaged” and I need to contact the Nespresso directly to get refund or replacement. Wait… how is that my problem exactly? No notification or anything for two days and somehow it’s my problem to resolve? I was pretty excited but now I feel like I am getting scammed 😂

Is this normal “service” for them? I should have just bought it on Amazon. 

I am in Southeastern USA with package apparently traveling from a city 2 hours away. It was one hour away at “shipping facility” for two days. Could have walked there to pick it up but apparently it’s been there two days “damaged”. I understand issues happen that’s life. I work with people on daily basis but I am less than excited.

1idywho,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/1idywho/im_not_able_to_approve_school/,I'm not able to approve school,"Last year, I started the second year of bachillerato (An academic program similar to the last grades of high schoolthat goes after the mandatory school in my country). for the first time and faced many problems. I was always isolated from the entire class and couldn’t pay attention to anything for even five seconds. The only thing I managed to do occasionally was ask the teacher something that seemed out of place or completely obvious, at best causing an awkward silence. I was unable to learn anything at school and felt like I was wasting my time. When I got home, I would study nonstop every day to try to prepare for the midterms and quarterly exams.



The first time I took the second-year course, it went horribly. I watched as everyone progressed, while I still didn’t understand the most basic things. Although I was relatively motivated to study, when I started to see that no matter how much I studied, I scored below a 5 on every exam, and in the first term I failed 6 out of 8 subjects, I couldn’t handle it and became even more depressed. Despite my poor results, my parents, seeing that I studied every day, didn’t give me too much trouble. They could see that I was generally always depressed and didn’t even hang out with other people or engage in any leisure activities, so they simply enrolled me in private tutoring to try to help me as best they could.



Even before starting the course, I already felt quite sad overall because I didn’t see anything changing in my life. I had never made a single friend in my life, and I had never been able to act normally. I hated going outside or doing any activity in general, dedicating myself solely to existing and occasionally talking on Discord, even though I hated interacting with anyone in general.



When the second term started, I tried to push myself harder, but after seeing no improvement in the first and second exams, I became even more depressed. Now, every time I tried to study anything, I couldn’t do it. The only thing I managed to do was think about how useless I was, ending up crying or my mind going completely blank, unable to think about anything. At school, five minutes after class started, the only thing that happened was that I would cry uncontrollably until it ended, and then I would go home. After a few days, I gradually stopped going to class and spent every day in bed, crying even more because I saw that I wasn’t even capable of doing something that everyone in my class had done: passing.



I stopped going altogether two months before the end of the course, making my parents suffer even more because I wasted an entire year of my life. The following year, I changed schools and tried bachillerato again. I tried to push myself harder, even though I was more depressed than at the beginning of the previous year. I continued to get bad grades and started crying every day in class again. After a DANA (a severe weather event where my state got flooded), we took the remaining exams for the first term and moved on to the second. Despite studying more this January than ever before in my life, I haven’t been able to pass anything. In 10 days from now, I have the quarterly exams, and tomorrow I have another exam. I haven’t been able to study or concentrate enough to learn anything in class. Every time I look at a book, a document, or a lesson, my mind goes blank, and I can’t do anything. Lately, I’ve been very tired and have no energy for anything, no matter how much coffee I drink. I can’t even keep my body upright; I’ve been lying in bed all week and have missed several classes because I couldn’t handle it and ended up crying no matter what I did. I’ve also lost my appetite, and I just don’t know what to do. I’ve asked the teachers for help, but they told me they don’t know how to help me in any way, that I should pay more attention in class and do my best. But now I can’t even write anything in my notebook. Wherever I go, I act like a zombie, unable to speak or communicate with anyone.



Honestly, I don’t know what to do with my life. All I want is to pass bachillerato like the rest of my family and move on with my life. I don’t want to be a useless idiot, living like a baby off my parents, but I’m completely incapable of doing anything. I don’t want to play the victim because I’m aware that all the problems I’ve accumulated throughout my life are my fault in one way or another. I’m just asking for advice because I don’t know how to fix my life. I can’t even do something as simple as pass a school course, and I have no one to talk to about this. What should I do to become a more functional person and at least complete my classes?

1idyvr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1idyvr0/removing_tempting_caffeine_sources_from_the_house/,Removing Tempting Caffeine Sources From the House,"Years ago on my weight loss journey, something that really helped was removing all tempting junk food from the house. Didn't buy it, didn't keep it around. And I also requested family members stop bringing me something home when they stopped by a fast food place.

It might seem obvious, but I've realized the same thing may also help with quitting caffeine.

Sure, you need discipline and commitment, but it also helps when the temptation isn't on hand for you to cave to any minute of any day.

Plus, consider the signal it sends to your subconscious. It thinks 'well, why else do I have this in my pantry if not to consume it?' Throwing it all away will resolve that contradiction and make your physical environment consistent with your internal choice to quit caffeine.

Because it's not only that ""your body is your brain""— your environment is also your brain. This is why 'cleaning your room' and so forth helps many people organize their minds.

So for me this means throwing away all the miscellaneous caffeine sources left in the house: tea's and instant coffee's tucked away in various parts of the kitchen. A caffeine-free house is a useful step towards a caffeine-free body.",1,1738274603.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1idygpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreCervicalCancer/comments/1idygpw/my_mostly_positive_leep_experience/,My mostly positive LEEP experience,"I am one week out from my LEEP procedure, and just got the pathology results back so I just wanted to share my experience.

I got my first abnormal PAP in 2021, ASCUS and HPV+. I had a colposcopy that same year and came back CIN1. Was advised to get another PAP in a year. In 2022 when I was due for the PAP I was pregnant so my provider held off on doing the PAP until post pregnancy. At my 6 week post partum check up in 2023 my PAP came back normal! Vaginal delivery “reset” my cervix back to normal. 

In 2024 my PAP came back abnormal again, ASUCS and HPV+. My colposcopy in November showed CIN2/3 with “strong block-like staining”. After that I was advised to get the LEEP, but I wasn’t able to schedule it until 1/23/25.

Waiting 3 months before the procedure was the hardest part. I had so much anxiety about it I just wanted to get it over with. I started taking 500 mG of vitamin C daily as well as 1500 mG of AHCC (a mushroom complex) to help support my immune system.

The LEEP was preformed in office. I requested an anti anxiety medication and a pain medication and my dr prescribed me a 1 time dose of both that I took 1 hour before the procedure. I also took 800 mG of ibuprofen too. The medications helped but not as much as I was hoping. (It’s worth noting I’m a natural redhead and my pain tolerance is much lower than average but my tolerance to medications is much higher, not a fun combo.) 

They let my headband in the procedure room with me so I could squeeze his hand. The speculum insertion was totally comfortable (thank you medicines) but the lidocaine injection still stung a bit. There’s adrenaline in the lidocaine so my heart started racing, I started shaking, and my hands went numb. The dr calmed me down and assured me that was normal. But it kind of sent me into an anxiety attack, even with the anti-anxiety meds on board. Once that feeling passed he proceeded with the LEEP and it wasn’t fun. I could feel LOTS of pressure and twinges of pain. I was just covering my eyes the whole thing and trying to focus on my breathing.

My husband played some music and that helped a lot with the anxiety. I could smell a hint of the BBQ human when he was cauterizing my cervix, but that wasn’t bad at all. I work in the OR and smell that smell all the time; I was real nervous to smell it knowing I’m the BBQ. But it was so mild I barely even noticed it. Then the dr applied the paste to stop me bleeding and it was done. It was very fast.

I told my husband that if I had to go back and do another id request conscious sedation. I have a lot of medical anxiety and just don’t want to go through that completely awake again. If I didn’t have preexisting anxiety it would have been a breeze and no big deal.

That same day I laid real low and didn’t do much. I was cramping for the rest of the day. The black coffee ground discharge is gross and smelly, and the worst part of recovery so far. I lost the liquid bandaid on day 3 and am still having discharge here on day 8. Not cramping too badly and I can resume all normal activities (besides inserting anything into my vagina) now. Recovery has been pretty easy.

The pathology results showed NO dysplasia! Besides some cervical inflammation, there’s no abnormalities or CIN present! The cervical sample that was sent in was 2.7x1.8x1.1 cm and  showed the transformation zone and was an acceptable specimen. P16 is now negative as well. I don’t need any further testing besides doing a PAP smear in a year.

My dr and I both are very happy with these results! It’s possible that the colposcopy removed a large portion of the abnormal cells, but I believe the vitamin C and AHCC helped play a role in this as well. 

If I had to do this all over again I’d ask for a higher level of sedation (but not necessarily fully sedated in the OR) and I’d DEFINITELY take the vitamin supplements. It wasn’t too bad, and I’m happy to answer any questions.",1,1738273528.0,PreCervicalCancer,0,1.0,False

1idycup,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1idycup/the_reflection/,The Reflection,"I moved into the apartment on a Thursday. It wasn’t much—peeling paint on the walls, uneven floors, and a kitchen that looked like it hadn’t been updated since the ‘70s—but it was cheap, and I needed cheap. The landlord handed me the keys with a nod, barely saying a word. He seemed eager to be rid of me, like he didn’t want to stick around.

The first thing I noticed was the smell. It wasn’t overpowering, but it was there. A damp, musty scent, like old wood left out in the rain. I shrugged it off. Old buildings smell like that sometimes.

The apartment was mostly empty, except for a few pieces of worn furniture that looked like they came from a thrift store. In the hallway, there was a mirror. It was tall, maybe six feet, with a thick gold frame that had intricate carvings along the edges. The glass was cloudy, smudged with dust and fingerprints.

I wasn’t sure why, but the mirror made me uneasy. It felt out of place, like it didn’t belong there. I told myself I was just being paranoid. Moving is stressful, and this was my first place on my own. Everything was bound to feel strange at first.

That first night, the apartment was eerily quiet. The kind of quiet that makes you feel like you’re being watched. I couldn’t sleep. Every creak of the floorboards made my skin crawl.

The next morning, I decided to clean. The mirror was the first thing I tackled. I grabbed an old rag and some glass cleaner and started scrubbing. As I wiped away the grime, I caught my reflection staring back at me.

Something about it didn’t feel right. I don’t know how to explain it, but it didn’t look like me. Not exactly. The movements were the same—I waved my hand, and the reflection waved back—but the eyes felt different. Like they were too aware, too focused.

I shook it off and finished cleaning. By the time the mirror was spotless, it looked like any other mirror. Just a piece of glass in a fancy frame.

That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I told myself I was imagining things, that I was just spooked from being in a new place. But when I turned off the lights and climbed into bed, I could feel it—the mirror. It was like it was watching me.

I kept waking up. Every time I did, I found myself staring at the doorway where the mirror stood, just out of sight. My heart would race, and I’d have to remind myself to breathe. It’s just a mirror, I thought. Glass and wood. Nothing more.

By the third night, I started noticing things. Little things. A flicker of movement out of the corner of my eye. A shadow that didn’t match anything in the room. I told myself it was the light, the way it bounced off the glass.

But then, late that night, I saw something I couldn’t explain. I was in bed, staring at the ceiling, trying to calm my mind. I glanced toward the hallway and froze.

The reflection wasn’t mine.

It was standing in the mirror, staring into the bedroom. The face was mine, but the expression wasn’t. It was twisted, wrong. The eyes were wide, unblinking. The mouth was curled into a faint, unnatural smile.

I blinked, and it was gone.

I stayed awake until dawn, my back pressed against the headboard, clutching the blanket like it could protect me.

The mirror hasn’t moved, but something tells me it doesn’t need to. Whatever is in there, it’s waiting. Watching.

And I don’t know how much longer I can ignore it.

I didn’t sleep that night. Every creak, every groan of the old apartment sent my heart racing. I kept looking at the hallway, expecting to see that twisted face again. It didn’t show up, but that didn’t make me feel any better.

When the first bit of sunlight crept through the blinds, I finally got up. My legs felt shaky as I made my way to the hallway. The mirror was right where it had been, tall and still, with the morning light glinting off its surface.

For a moment, I just stood there, staring at it. The reflection was normal now—just me, tired and pale, with dark circles under my eyes. I wanted to believe that what I’d seen was a dream, but deep down, I knew it wasn’t.

I grabbed a sheet from the closet and threw it over the mirror. The fabric caught on the edges of the ornate frame, covering it entirely. I stood back, feeling a small sense of relief. If I couldn’t see it, maybe it couldn’t see me either.

That didn’t last long.

The rest of the day, I couldn’t focus on anything. I tried unpacking more boxes, but every time I walked past the hallway, I felt it. The mirror was still there, even hidden under the sheet. I couldn’t explain it, but it was like the air around it was heavier.

By the time night rolled around, I was on edge. I left the lights on, every single one. Even then, I kept glancing toward the hallway.

Around midnight, the sound started.

It was faint at first. A soft tapping, like someone gently knocking on glass. I froze, my heart hammering in my chest. The sound was coming from the hallway—from the mirror.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe.

The tapping grew louder, more insistent. It wasn’t random—it had a rhythm, like someone was trying to get my attention.

I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight. My hands were trembling as I crept toward the hallway. The tapping stopped the moment I stepped closer.

The sheet was still in place, draped over the mirror. Nothing had changed, but I knew better.

I wanted to walk away. To go back to my room, lock the door, and pretend none of this was happening. But something compelled me to stay. My hand reached out, almost on its own, and I pulled the sheet down.

The mirror was spotless, the glass smooth and perfect. My reflection stared back at me, but it wasn’t right. It looked normal, but the eyes… they felt too sharp, too alive.

I wanted to step away, but I couldn’t. My reflection leaned forward, even though I wasn’t moving.

“Why are you scared?” it whispered.

The voice wasn’t mine. It was cold, distant, like it was coming from deep inside the mirror.

I stumbled back, almost tripping over my own feet. The reflection didn’t follow me this time—it stayed in the glass, smiling faintly.

“Don’t ignore me,” it said.

The lights in the hallway flickered, and the reflection began to blur. For a split second, I thought I saw something else in the glass—a dark shape, taller than me, with hollow eyes. But then it was gone.

I ran back to my room and slammed the door shut. My breathing was shallow, my hands shaking as I pressed my back against the door.

I didn’t sleep at all that night.

By morning, I decided I couldn’t stay here. I didn’t care about breaking the lease or losing the deposit—I just needed to get out.

But when I tried to leave, the front door wouldn’t budge.

The lock turned easily, and the handle moved, but it was like something was holding the door shut. I pulled harder, throwing my weight into it, but it didn’t make a difference.

Behind me, I heard the tapping again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I turned slowly, my stomach twisting into knots. The mirror was still in the hallway, uncovered now, and my reflection was back.

It wasn’t smiling anymore. It looked angry.

“You can’t leave,” it said.

The voice wasn’t a whisper this time. It was loud, filling the apartment.

I backed away, pressing myself against the front door. My reflection stepped closer, even though I hadn’t moved.

“You belong to me now,” it said.

The lights flickered again, and the apartment felt colder. I don’t know how long I stood there, staring at the mirror. But when the lights finally came back on, the reflection was gone.

The mirror was empty.

I tried the door again, and this time it opened. I didn’t think—I just ran. Out of the apartment, down the stairs, into the street.

I haven’t gone back.

But sometimes, when I pass by the building, I can feel it. The mirror is still in there, waiting.

And sometimes, I think it’s watching me.

I didn’t know what to do after that. I’d left the apartment behind, but it didn’t feel like I’d escaped. The first few nights at my friend Taylor’s place were quiet. I slept on her couch, with the TV on for background noise, and told myself everything would be fine.

But it wasn’t fine.

I hadn’t told Taylor much, just that the apartment creeped me out and I needed a place to crash. She didn’t ask questions, which I appreciated. But I couldn’t keep pretending nothing was wrong.

The first sign came three nights later. I woke up in a cold sweat at 3 a.m. The TV was still playing some late-night infomercial, but the sound was muted. I glanced around the room, heart racing, and then I saw it.

My reflection.

There was a large window behind Taylor’s couch, and in the faint glow of the street lights outside, I could see my reflection in the glass. Except it wasn’t just mine.

Something else was there, standing just behind me.

It was the same dark figure I’d seen in the mirror, its hollow eyes staring at me through the glass.

I whipped around, but there was nothing there. My breath came in short, shallow gasps as I stared at the empty room. When I turned back to the window, the figure was gone.

I didn’t sleep for the rest of the night.

The next morning, Taylor noticed the bags under my eyes. “You look like hell,” she said, handing me a cup of coffee. “You sure you’re okay?”

I wanted to tell her everything, but where would I even start? “Yeah,” I mumbled. “Just couldn’t sleep.”

She gave me a look but didn’t push it.

That day, I tried to keep busy. I scrolled through apartment listings, went for a walk, even helped Taylor with some errands. But no matter what I did, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched.

By the time the sun set, my nerves were shot. I told Taylor I wasn’t feeling well and went to bed early, hoping sleep would come if I just shut my eyes and waited.

It didn’t.

Around midnight, I heard it again.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

I froze, my eyes snapping open. The sound was coming from the window this time.

I sat up slowly, my heart pounding so hard it hurt. The curtains were drawn, but the tapping continued, steady and deliberate.

I didn’t want to look. I didn’t want to know. But something pulled me toward the window anyway.

I reached out with a trembling hand and pulled the curtain back.

There was nothing there. Just the empty street below and the dim glow of a streetlamp.

I let out a shaky breath and turned away, but then I heard it. A voice, soft and familiar, whispering my name.

I spun back to the window, and there it was. My reflection.

But it wasn’t right.

The glass didn’t show the room behind me. Instead, it showed the hallway from my old apartment. The mirror.

And my reflection was smiling again.

“You can’t run,” it said.

The voice sent chills down my spine. It wasn’t coming from the window—it was in my head, echoing like a bad memory.

I stumbled back, tripping over the edge of the couch. My reflection didn’t follow me this time. It stayed in the window, grinning, its empty eyes locked onto mine.

“Leave me alone!” I shouted, my voice cracking.

Taylor came rushing into the room, her face a mix of confusion and concern. “What’s going on?” she asked.

I pointed at the window, but when she turned to look, it was just a window again. My reflection was normal, the hallway and the mirror gone.

“I… I thought I saw something,” I stammered.

Taylor frowned, crossing her arms. “You’re freaking me out. Are you sure everything’s okay?”

I wanted to tell her the truth, but how could I? She’d think I was losing my mind. Maybe I was.

“Yeah,” I lied. “Just a bad dream.”

She didn’t look convinced, but she nodded. “Alright. But if you need to talk, I’m here, okay?”

I nodded, forcing a weak smile.

When she left the room, I collapsed onto the couch, my head in my hands. I couldn’t keep living like this. The mirror wasn’t just in that apartment—it was following me.

And I had no idea how to make it stop.

The next day, I knew I couldn’t ignore it any longer. Whatever was happening, whatever *it* was, I needed answers.

I didn’t say much to Taylor that morning. She was already on edge from the night before, giving me that look people give when they’re not sure if you’re okay but don’t know how to ask. I just told her I had errands to run and left.

My first stop was the library. It felt old-fashioned, but Googling “haunted mirror” and “weird reflections” hadn’t gotten me very far. At least at the library, I could dig deeper, maybe even find some local stories about the apartment or the building.

The librarian was a small, older woman with kind eyes. She didn’t ask why I needed information on “strange occurrences in apartments” or “haunted objects,” which I appreciated. She simply pointed me toward a section of local history books and articles.

I spent hours flipping through yellowed pages and faded photographs. Most of it was boring—city planning, old businesses, stories of long-dead locals—but one article caught my attention.

It was from the 1970s, about a man named Richard Ames. He’d lived in my old apartment, the same one with the mirror. The headline read: “Mysterious Disappearance Leaves More Questions Than Answers.”

The story detailed how Richard Ames had vanished without a trace. Neighbors reported hearing strange noises coming from his apartment late at night—whispers, laughter, tapping on the walls. The landlord found the place empty a week later, except for one thing: a massive gold-framed mirror, left in the hallway.

The description matched the mirror exactly.

I leaned back in my chair, my pulse racing. The article didn’t explain what happened to Richard or why he disappeared, but it felt like confirmation. This wasn’t just in my head. The mirror had a history.

But what did it want with me?

I copied down the article’s details and headed home. Well, to Taylor’s home. It didn’t feel like mine anymore.

When I got there, she was waiting for me, arms crossed. “You’ve been gone all day,” she said. “Are you okay?”

I hesitated. I’d been brushing her off for days, but I couldn’t do it anymore. “I need to tell you something,” I said, my voice quieter than I wanted it to be.

Taylor frowned but gestured for me to sit down. “Alright, spill.”

So, I told her everything. The mirror, the reflection, the tapping, the voice. I left nothing out.

When I finished, Taylor just stared at me, her mouth slightly open. “You’re serious?” she finally said.

I nodded.

She sighed, rubbing her temples. “Okay. This is… a lot. But if you think this mirror is haunted or cursed or whatever, why don’t we just go back to the apartment and get rid of it?”

Her suggestion caught me off guard. The thought of going back made my stomach churn, but she had a point. If the mirror was the source of all this, destroying it might be the only way to end it.

“I don’t know if that’ll work,” I said. “But I’m willing to try.”

Taylor grabbed her car keys before I could change my mind. “Then let’s do it. The sooner, the better.”

The drive to the apartment was tense. I hadn’t been back since I left, and seeing the building again made my chest tighten. It looked the same—run-down, quiet—but now I knew better.

We went up the stairs, and I unlocked the door with the spare key I still had. The air inside was stale, and the musty smell hit me immediately. The mirror was right where I’d left it, in the hallway, its gold frame catching the faint light from the window.

Taylor walked up to it, inspecting it like it was just another piece of furniture. “This is it?” she asked.

I nodded, staying a few steps back.

She tapped the glass. “Doesn’t look so scary to me.”

Before I could respond, the reflection shifted.

Taylor froze, her hand still against the glass. Her reflection turned to look directly at her, even though she wasn’t moving.

“What the hell…” she whispered, stepping back.

The reflection didn’t mimic her. Instead, it smiled—a wide, unnatural grin that didn’t belong on her face.

“Taylor, get away from it!” I yelled.

But it was too late.

The mirror started to hum, a low, vibrating sound that made my teeth ache. The air around us felt heavy, like the room was collapsing in on itself.

“Do you see that?” Taylor shouted, backing away.

I saw it. The surface of the mirror rippled like water, and the reflection reached out. A hand—Taylor’s hand, but *not* Taylor’s—pressed against the glass from the inside, its fingers curling as if trying to break through.

“Run!” I screamed, grabbing her arm and yanking her toward the door.

The mirror’s hum grew louder, almost deafening, and the distorted reflection of Taylor watched us with that same twisted grin.

We didn’t stop running until we were outside, gasping for air.

“What the hell was that?” Taylor panted, her face pale.

“I don’t know,” I said, my voice shaking. “But I think it wants more than just a reflection.”

Neither of us spoke for a long time. We just sat on the curb outside the building, catching our breath, our minds racing. Taylor was the first to break the silence.

“What do we do now?” she asked. Her voice was shaky, but there was a sharpness to it, a demand for answers I didn’t have.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “But we can’t just leave it there. It’s… dangerous. I mean, you saw it. That thing isn’t just some creepy trick. It’s—”

“Alive,” she finished for me. “Or something close to it.”

We sat there a little longer, the weight of what we’d seen pressing down on us. The mirror wasn’t just haunted. It wasn’t just showing strange reflections. It was *something else*, something I couldn’t explain.

“We should destroy it,” Taylor said finally.

Her words hung in the air, heavy and final. Destroying it felt like the logical choice, but the thought of going back in there, of facing that thing again, made my stomach churn.

“What if it doesn’t work?” I asked. “What if breaking it makes it worse?”

Taylor gave me a sharp look. “Worse than it already is? That thing tried to pull me in. I’m not letting it sit there and wait for someone else to stumble onto it.”

She was right. As much as I wanted to run away, to never think about that mirror again, I couldn’t leave it behind for someone else to find.

“Alright,” I said. “But we need to be smart about it. If we’re going to destroy it, we need to make sure it’s gone for good.”

Taylor nodded, her jaw set. “Let’s do it tonight. Before we lose our nerve.”





The hours dragged by as we made our plan. We’d bring tools—hammers, a crowbar, whatever we could find—to break the mirror apart. We’d bag up the pieces and take them far away from the apartment, maybe to the river or some secluded spot where no one would ever find them.

Taylor raided her dad’s garage for supplies while I sat at her kitchen table, staring at the article I’d found about Richard Ames. I couldn’t stop thinking about him. Had he tried to destroy the mirror? Had it stopped him?

When Taylor returned, her arms loaded with tools, I pushed the thought away. We didn’t have time for second-guessing.

“You ready?” she asked, setting a sledgehammer on the floor with a thud.

“Not really,” I said honestly. “But let’s do it.”





We drove back to the apartment just before midnight. The streets were empty, and the building loomed in the dark, its windows like hollow eyes.

The air inside was colder than before, and the silence felt oppressive. My heart was pounding as we made our way to the hallway, the tools clanking in the bag Taylor carried.

The mirror was waiting for us, just like before. Its surface was still and smooth, but I could feel it watching us.

“Let’s get this over with,” Taylor muttered, pulling the sledgehammer from the bag.

She handed me a crowbar, and we stood in front of the mirror, both of us hesitating.

“Do you feel that?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

Taylor nodded. “Yeah. Like it’s… alive.”

I tightened my grip on the crowbar. “On three?”

She nodded again.

“One… two…”

Before I could say three, the mirror rippled. The smooth surface shifted, and our reflections appeared—not as they should have been, but wrong. Twisted.

Taylor’s reflection had empty black eyes and a smile stretched too wide, like it was pulled by invisible strings. Mine was worse. It wasn’t smiling. It was staring at me, its head tilted, its expression full of something I couldn’t name.

Fear. Hunger. Hate.

“Do it!” I shouted.

Taylor swung the sledgehammer with all her strength. The impact rang out like a gunshot, and the mirror cracked, a jagged line splitting down the middle.

The reflections didn’t shatter. They moved.

Taylor swung again, and the crack widened, but now the mirror was humming, the same low, vibrating sound as before. The room felt like it was spinning, the air thick and heavy.

“Keep going!” I yelled, raising the crowbar and slamming it against the glass.

The mirror groaned, like a living thing in pain. More cracks spread across its surface, but the reflections were still there, moving, pressing against the glass as if trying to break through.

“Why isn’t it breaking?” Taylor screamed, hitting it again and again.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. The humming was deafening now, and the cracks in the glass were glowing, a sickly, unnatural light spilling out.

Then, the mirror screamed.

It was a sound I’ll never forget—high-pitched, inhuman, full of rage and despair. The light from the cracks flared, blinding us, and the air around us seemed to explode.

I was thrown backward, hitting the wall hard. The last thing I saw before everything went black was the mirror shattering, the pieces flying in every direction like shards of light.

And then, silence.

When I came to, everything was quiet. Too quiet.

My head was pounding, and I struggled to sit up. The hallway was dim, lit only by the faint flicker of a street lamp outside. Broken shards of glass glittered on the floor like tiny stars, and the tools Taylor and I had brought lay scattered.

“Taylor?” My voice came out hoarse, barely above a whisper. I looked around, panic building in my chest when I didn’t see her.

Then I heard a groan.

“Taylor!” I scrambled toward the sound, my hands crunching over shards of glass. She was slumped against the wall a few feet away, clutching her arm.

“Hey, hey, are you okay?” I asked, grabbing her shoulders.

She blinked at me, her eyes dazed. “What… what happened?”

“The mirror,” I said. “It shattered.”

Her gaze shifted to the pile of broken glass, and she let out a shaky breath. “Is it… gone?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted. My voice trembled despite my efforts to stay calm.

We both turned to look at the spot where the mirror had hung. The golden frame was still there, but the glass was gone—reduced to a million tiny pieces scattered across the floor.

But something felt off.

The air was heavy, like the moment before a thunderstorm. And there was a faint sound, so quiet I almost missed it. A whisper.

“Do you hear that?” I asked.

Taylor’s face went pale. “Yeah. It’s coming from…”

We both turned to the largest shard of glass lying on the floor. The whispering was louder now, rising and falling like a chant in a language I couldn’t understand.

“I think we need to leave,” Taylor said, her voice tight.

I nodded, but my legs felt like lead. I couldn’t take my eyes off the shard. There was something in it—movement, shapes twisting and writhing just beneath the surface.

“Come on,” Taylor urged, pulling at my arm.

That snapped me out of it. I stood, gripping her hand, and we stumbled out of the hallway. My heart was racing as we ran down the stairs and out into the cold night air.

We didn’t stop until we were a block away. Only then did we turn to look back at the building.

The window on the second floor—the one closest to where the mirror had been—was glowing faintly.

Taylor shivered. “What do we do now?”

I didn’t have an answer. Destroying the mirror had felt like the only solution, but whatever we’d done hadn’t fixed things. If anything, it felt worse.

“We need help,” I said finally. “Someone who knows about… this kind of thing.”

“Like an exorcist?” Taylor asked, her voice dripping with skepticism.

“Maybe,” I said. “I don’t know. But we can’t just leave it like this.”

Taylor sighed, rubbing her face with her hands. “Okay. But not tonight. I can’t… I just can’t.”

I nodded. I didn’t blame her. My whole body ached, and my mind was a mess.

We went back to her car and sat in silence for a while, trying to process what had happened.

But as we sat there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we weren’t alone.





That night, I stayed at Taylor’s place. Neither of us slept. We sat in her living room with the lights on, jumping at every creak and shadow.

Around three in the morning, my phone buzzed.

The screen lit up with a notification: ""Missed Call – Unknown.""

My heart skipped a beat.

“Who is it?” Taylor asked, her voice wary.

I didn’t answer. My hands were trembling as I unlocked the phone and checked my voicemail.

There was a new message.

With a deep breath, I pressed play.

At first, there was only static. Then, faintly, I heard it.

My own voice.

“Don’t look behind you.”

A cold chill ran down my spine. Taylor must have seen the look on my face because her eyes widened.

“What is it?” she asked.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t.

Because I could feel it.

Something was behind me.

I didn’t turn around.

And I don’t think I ever will.

1idyb52,https://www.reddit.com/r/henna/comments/1idyb52/can_i_add_extra_water/,Can I add extra water?,"Hey all. I recently dyed my hair with premixed henna caravan henna. I love it, but would like the red a bit more intense, as the color is still pretty subtle. 

I have three more things of henna in the freezer, and would like to use those. However, when I used henna the first time, I found that it was extremely hard to apply. My hair matted immediately and it was very difficult for me to coordinate applying the henna evenly. I ended up just globbing it on and trying to pull the solid mass apart to apply it in the center of the mat, and the ""inside"" of that mat ended up not getting quite as colored. The second it touched hair that piece of hair was unmanageable, and the second dry hair touched the hennaed hair they stuck together. I did this with completely dry hair that had been shampooed with a clarifying shampoo earlier that day. 

I see videos of people applying henna that is thinner than mine and it seems much easier. It looks like it would seep in better, spread better, and be easier to maneuver my hair around to ensure it gets to my roots. 

I assume adding water or coffee or tea to my Already mixed henna will reduce the color transfer somewhat, and I'm okay with that. My worry is that adding extra water will somehow ruin the process or cause so much of an issue that it won't do anything at all.",1,1738273142.0,henna,2,1.0,False

He sleeps between midnight and 9am, without waking up. He has wake windows of 2h during the day. The first nap lasts about 1h30 and than gets shorter as the day goes by. I even tried to put him to sleep at 10pm (bath, low lights, full feed, white noise, singing to him, all the works), but he wakes up after 20min and stays up until midnight. 

Social media with it's millions of sleep training consultants have me thinking im failing as a mother, because he's not in bed at 7pm and other things.

I dont have a daily life routine, even when I try to apply one, I can't get a hold of it. I get bored and uninterested. I often don't feel like doing things and end up spending time on my phone.

Usually we wake up, feed the baby, put him his park or chair for solo play time while I make breakfast (and interacting with baby every few minutes). By the time we finish breakfast, it's his first nap, to which of course he needs me to fall asleep, he doesn't fall independently (but once asleep I can put him in his crib at least). Sometimes I take a nap at the same time or work on the house.

After he wake up the day goes.....well....whatever.... he's breastfeeding on demand, so there's no feeding scheadule. I don't work, so there's no structure to my day. And even if I plan house chores, once the time comes my brain will go ""whatever"".

Oh and playtime with baby, forget it. I don't think I play with him nearly as much as internet tells me I should. I interact with him, talk to him, bring him around the house while I do chores, but there's no reading time, there's no sitting down with toys for long periods of time, nor different sensorial activities, etc

It's also winter in Canada, so there's no daily walk nor outside activities (it's -15°C outside), the sky is grey, and seasonal depression is real. I met with a mom from the neighborhood and went for a walk once, but I didn't have much in common and the conversations felt weird and forced.

I haven't gone to the gym in months, last time I shaved my legs was before my son was born, I often have coffee and buttered toast for lunch because I don't meal prep, we have a 60lb extra stubborn high energy puppy that overstimulates me everyday (we still love him), sometimes I go 3 days without a shower and I don't remember when was the last time I worked on one of my hobbies (besides gaming).",0,1738273109.0,firsttimemom,0,0.5,False

1idy7nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovingThroughChange/comments/1idy7nc/the_hidden_toll_of_moving_why_its_more_than_just/,The Hidden Toll of Moving: Why It’s More Than Just Packing Boxes,"Even minor life transitions shake up familiar habits, and our bodies? They *love* familiarity. Our bodies depend on familiarity the way we depend on internet access. So much so, that we're biologically wired to maintain a sort of familiarity known as homeostasis—the body's way of keeping things as predictable, stable, and consistent as possible. When that balance is disrupted, it hits the Three Pillars of Emotional Health: sleep, appetite, and mood. So here's why moving messes with our head (and body).

**Stress Isn’t Just in Your Head—It’s in Your Body.**  
Moving comes with a million decisions—big and small—all laced with uncertainty. This stress isn’t just *felt*; it’s processed physically, messing with sleep cycles, eating patterns, and emotional regulation.

**You Might Be Grieving Without Realizing It.**  
Leaving behind a familiar place, routine, or even your go-to coffee shop can trigger grief. It doesn’t always look like sadness; sometimes it’s irritability, restlessness, or just feeling *off*.

**Your Emotions Dictate Your Behaviors.**  
Feeling anxious, frustrated, or unsettled? You might find yourself procrastinating on unpacking, withdrawing from social plans, or avoiding anything that reminds you of the change. The brain craves certainty, and when it doesn’t get it, it reacts—sometimes in ways we don’t expect.

# As we come together to move through change, consider the bottom line:

Moving isn’t just a logistical challenge—it’s an emotional event. And whether the idea of moving fills you with excitement or existential dread, it will inevitably touch those three core pillars of well-being. But here’s the good news: **awareness is power**. Understanding how change affects us physically and emotionally gives us the ability to manage it. 

So, what about you? Have you noticed any unexpected emotional or behavioral shifts during a move? How did you handle them? Let’s talk about it.

What up Cobra Guys,

It's the Shaggfather here with another episode breakdown of Cobra Kai Season 6 Episode 8 Snakes on a plane. This episode didn't have much fighting, but did have in my opinion, one of the best storylines of the series, and one of the most cringeworthy storylines of the series. So much happens in this episode, and there are a lot of scenes of just dialog.

The scenes with the drunk guy on the plane, and Johnny were kind of absurd. That dude was sticking his nose in business he didn't belong in, and Johnny didn't need to explain that there was a family emergency to him. Just a note, that plane was incredibly small for being an international flight. The plane would have most likely been a Boeing 747 or an Airbus which are much larger planes.

I loved Chozen in this episode, his interaction with Hawk telling him, ""only if you hit the town hard"", was great. It shows how much he relates to the Binary Bros. It was a super funny moment. 

Miguel has a right to be upset considering his mom is in the hospital and he doesn't know if she'll make it. However,  Miguel's comment ""no wonder Robby is so messed up"" was completely out of line. I literally gasped when he said that. Miguel has always been a let his anger take over, saying and doing things based on his emotions, but I thought he got past a lot of that, after the school brawl. Looks like in stressful situations, he still resorts to his Cobra Kai training.

Okay, I'm super glad they picked Kenny to go to Barcelona.  He was the only choice. However, I pose this question to you, if Kenny wasn't available, who do you pick out of the rest of the students to bring to the tournament? For me,  I'm not sure if this tournament is a completely under 18 tournament or not because it really isn't specified. If it is, I choose Chris. If it isn't, I would try to get in touch with Kyler.

The scenes with Anthony and Kenny were awesome and I actually loved the interactions between them. The shitbutt meme was pretty funny as well.  So I paused the screen to see what the comments were on the meme because I was trying to find out who actually posted it. I think I came up with a culprit. This is what the comments on the meme page said:

January 26, 1986 was the worst day in NASA history, that is, until today. I present to you....  The one, the only, the shitbutt.

a_c_bee:

Duddeeeee this man broke orbit he's probably halfway to Uranus by now.

sus_shelter:

Oh my God this is almost dumb & dumber level please tell me this is photoshopped hahahahahaha.

________________________________________________

Okay, zack_attack445 is most certainly Zack Johnson, Anthony's friend. a_c_bee might very well be former Cobra Kai member, Abe (if you remove the _c_, the name reads abee.). And sus_shelter, no idea on that one. My guess is Zack is the owner of the Westvalley_fartboyz account, and posted the meme to get back at Kenny for beating them up. He even references shitbutt in his comment, and shows no empathy. 

One of favorite storylines of the entire series, was the Chozen/Kim Da Eun storyline.  I loved everything about them going to search for the students, the comedy, and especially the hook up. In the end I know a lot of people are on Kumiko's side, but frankly I don't think she has anything in common with Chozen, and there doesn't look to be any love there.  They are close friends and no more. 

Axel, I loved the concept of his character at first. But he's just so dull.. I don't really like their writing choice, regarding his character after seeing all of the episodes in part II. Kwon on the other hand hit hard with all.of his lines. His writing was amazing throughout all of season 6. 

Okay, In the bar, when they first show Dimitri, Hawk, and Devon talking, why is Devon sitting in the next booth?  There looked to be plenty of room in their booth for all three of them. I thought that was weird. When you go to a restaurant or a bar, you don't sit in someone else's both and talk to the table next to you.

Dimitri dancing with another girl at the bar. Why on earth did Yasmine make such a big deal out of it? Dimitri didn't cheat on anyone, he just got up to dance, and if he just explained to Yasmine that he didn't want to be rude to the girl, Yasmine probably would have understood. Would have been a good throw back to Karate kid II if Dimitri had some better dance moves (like Daniel did).

Tory wasn't upset when Robby *and I quote* ""slept with Zara""? Unrealistic, she should have been fuming mad. Anyways, I put quotations because, if this scene was on an episode of SVU, there would have been a sexual assault arrest, and conviction. I mean you guys were right when he said he looked like he got roofied. He was so out of it. The absolute worst and cringeworthy writing of the show, they should have explained it better or had Robby show some interest in Zara. They didn't.

I'm glad Devon owned up, and apologized to Kenny. He really ""showed his quality"", for forgiving her right away. 

I really wish the Sam and Axel vs. Drunk Cobra Kai fight in the alley was longer. They cut that scene off so quick, as if it was just an afterthought. Would have been cool to see some actual Miyagi do techniques.  One thing I noticed noticed, up until this point, I don't think I've seen any of the students doing anything other than paint the fence and wax on wax off. They were trained so many techniques, the wheel,  Crane Kick, drum technique.... WHY AREN'T THEY USING THEM?  unless they are saving them for the final fight. 

I loved the final scenes of this episode. The Chozen/Kim scene was cute.  The Terry Silver/Dennis/Sensei Wolf alliance, and reveal at the end in the hot tub was epic. I was so glad they brought back Terry. I'm expecting big things from him in part III.

I love when this show does this. They make you think that certain people will have beef for the whole series, but resolve relationships in the perfect moments. I thought this episode did that beautifully. Don't worry dojang, Kenny is on his way!! The guy who shit his pants, is coming to the rescue of Miyagi do. 

Welp time for a little gamage. 

1.  Smooth operator award. 

Kwon was super smooth getting under Robby's skin in the bar, and under Sam's skin in the alley. Every scene he was in was excellent. His ""don't worry, I'll keep her warm tonight"" and ""rival dojo playtime"" comments hit hard. 

2. Snake of the day award.

My snake of the day goes to westvalley_fartboyz channel owner himself, Zack Johnson, for, in my opinion, being the culprit responsible for cyber bullying Kenny with his shitbutt meme.  And.. commenting in his own comment section to get more people to comment as well? What a snake thing to do.

3. Dynamic duo of the week.

Chozen and Kim Da Eun made an excellent duo this week. Their story, hook up, and the way they look at each other in every scene following, is what makes me feel that they belong together. 

4. I understand that reference award.

Carmen's ""promise me one thing, win."" is a pretty direct Rocky II reference. 

I said it before, Zackattack_445 is a reference to Zack Johnson. Anthony's best friend. And a_c_bee, very well may be, former Cobra Kai student Abe.

Not sure if this is one, but Kwon's rival playtime comment (and comments throughout all of part II), is a throwback to the type of comments Chozen made to Daniel in Karate Kid II. Everything Kwon does reminds me of a young Chozen.

And of course, Terry motherfucking Silver in a hot tub is a reference to Karate Kid III.

5. The most badass badass.

The most bad ass bad ass of this episode was Carmen and the baby this week. She really was a champ, knowing the pain and bleeding she's going through with the baby complications, she still sent Johnny and Miguel back to Barcelona to finish the fight. And the baby, for being a fighter and not dying. 

6. Manna from heaven.

My manna from heaven is also Carmen and the baby not dying. If that happened, it would have crushed my soul into a steaming lump of God knows what..

7. Seek and destroy award.

Kim Da Eun and Chozen get my seek and destroy this week. They seeked out the students and destroyed their fued with a wild night of hot steamy beach sex. 

8. Potent quotables.

Johnny ""excuse me stewardess, why is the plane doing this bendy thing?"" I laughed at that scene so hard. Johnny cracks me up.

Chozen ""what happens in Barcelona, stays in Barcelona."" I Loved everything about their storyline this episode, and morning coffee scene. 

9. Bitch don't you know I know karate?

Drunken Yoon, with his attack on Axel in the alley. He said bitch, I can see you balling your fist, don't you know I know Karate too? and struck first. 

10. Five Words to describe the episode.

Terrys hot tub time machine!

I'm not gonna lie, that scene made me say ""holy fuck tard!"" I was so surprised to see his return in this episode and in the hot tub of all places! 

11. Douchebag of the week.

Zara is the douchebag of this entire episode. Preying on a drunken Robby, luring him back to her hotel room, and sexually assaulting him.  He couldn't remember what happened, it is very clear to me what went down, despite what the writers have told us. I very much dislike her character after this happened. 


Welp, I very much enjoyed this whole episode. A lot of storylines had more tension applied, and some got resolved completely. It was a nice breath of fresh air. 

Have a great week everyone, and as always Bonsai. 

Peace, 
Shaggs on a plane.

So i am bisexual, knew since i was 14-15 but I haven’t told anyone and haven’t tried anything cause i live in a very small town. I went to this trip with my friends last week(still here) and I decided to download Grindr cause I wanted to see what it is all about, maybe meet someone. I was still a virgin and had only kissed a girl.

That’s how I met him. He didn’t have a profile pic, no age listed, but he was really sweet. We talked for hours before he finally told me… he’s 42. And she. He asked if I wanted to come over to his place, somehow I said yes.

He was only in shorts when I went there and fully relaxed, while, I was so nervous I could barely talk.

He made me coffee, sat with me, and even asked if I wanted to leave because I looked so on edge. I told him no, that I’ve just never done this before. He smiled and moved closer. He told me I was cute. Then his hand was on my thigh.

He must have realised I was nervous, cause he stopped, and we just talked for a while. Eventually, I relaxed, and things started again. And I don’t know how to explain it, but something in me just clicked.I couldn’t stop looking at his shorts, at the way he shifted, at the very obvious bulge. He caught me staring. He took my hand, placed it on him and told me to take them off.

After that things got real. He guided my head down and I gave my first bj. At some point he stopped me and I thought I might have hurt him with my teeth( I read that can happen) but he wanted to take things to the bedroom.

He pushed me on the bed and after getting me naked and licking all of my body we went 69 and I sucked him( he does not like to suck c*ck.). Instead he ate my h*le and fingered me. It was really weird but I couldn’t really say anything with his c*ck in my mouth and I really didn’t want this to end so I let him. 

Then he got up and flipped me over and kept eating my h*le. That one I enjoyed a lot. Then I felt him on my entrance. I got really nervous and told him I was a virgin and didn’t know if i was ready for that. He said he wasn’t going to put it in, just wanted to feel it. I nodded. He rubbed, teased, pushed a little for some time… and then the head slipped in. I froze. He apologised. I said it was okay. And I guess he took that as permission cause he kept going.

He isn’t too big maybe 6-6,5 inches but very thick.

He asked if I wanted to use a condom. My brain was not working. I just said, “I don’t know.” He told me it feels better without. I just nodded. Next thing I knew, he was all the way in, kissing me, holding me, whispering in my ear. I told him it hurt but he said it is okay and to relax and breathe. He kept asking if I’m okay, and if I am hurting. After a few minutes the pain went away. I told him. He started moving.

And holy sh*t. I was enjoying it. Like A LOT. He went slow first but kept hitting that spot in me that made me see stars and I was rock hard pretty soon. 

Then he pulled out. I asked him what’s wrong. He asked me if I wanted to stop. I told him I didn’t. And that I wanted him to keep going but he was worried cause it was my first time and I basically then started asking- begging- him to keep f**king me. 

And that’s when something in him snapped.

He went hard. Fucked me for almost 2 hours, almost no stopping. I came twice and he kept going. After wrecking me, he stopped when I couldn’t ride him anymore and made me get on my knees, and finished all over my face and mouth and made me shallow.

That was night one.

Then, I freaked out. I got paranoid about STIs, so I messaged him at 3 AM. He told me he gets tested regularly because he’s in the military and even offered to show me his results. So I went over to check. And then… yeah. He f*ed me again.**

Now it’s been five days, and I’ve been sneaking off to his place every. Single. Day. And my friends are starting to ask questions—where I keep disappearing to, why I’m always out so early in the morning, why I come back looking like I just ran a marathon. I keep making excuses, but I don’t know how much longer that’ll work.

And now I don’t know what to do because:

He’s my dad’s age. If one of my friends told me they were hooking up with a 42-year-old, I’d be weirded out. But somehow, I can’t stop myself.
We’ve been going full bareback. He’s finished in me multiple times. It’s insanely hot in the moment, but afterward, I freak out a little. But I also can’t say no to him. Hell, once the condom did break, and I just kept riding him.
I thought I was a top. Turns out, I’m definitely not.
The real problem? I only have a week left here. But it turns out he’s moving to the same city where I’m starting university next month. And he’s already asked me to dinner.

I have no idea what I’m doing. Am I overthinking this? Should I just go with it? Be more cautious? I’ve never had anything like this happen before, and I have no one to talk to about it.

The title of the book is Diamond. I don't remember the author but I do remember reading the book between 2015-2017. It is based in Namibia.

The book starts on a particular Friday and the main character Ndeshipanda Mbagula(I'm not sure about the last name) walks from school with her friends to her mother's workplace while eating ice cream. Her mother works in a supermarket and Ndeshi waits for her mother's shift to end in the Staff lounge. She decided to wash off her sticky fingers in the Staff washroom. That is where she meets her mother's co-worker (let's call her criminal lady) as she exist a bathroom stall looking sus. When Criminal lady leaves the washroom, Ndeshi enters the stall and sees a bar of soap on top the wall of the stall and feels something hard in the middle of it. She takes it and washes her hands with it then wraps it and puts it in her pocket.  The police then come on an investigation that a diamond has been stolen and they suspect that it had been delivered to someone working at the supermarket where Ndeshipanda's mom works. Ndeshipanda's mom tells her to go home without her and gives her bus fare.

Ndeshipanda gets home and packs her bags for a fishing trip she has with her cousin that weekend. As she waits, she hears on the news that there has been an escaped convict and is on the run. Just as Ndeshi finishes making sandwiches for the road, she hears someone breaking into her house. It's the escaped convict. She escapes to the treehouse that was hidden by the leaves and waits for her cousin in it. When she sees her cousin's truck approaching, she bolts to it and the convict hears the commotion and exits the house and starts firing shots. Ndeshipanda and her cousin then get get in a chase with the convict and he's firing more shots but they escape by driving up a dry river bed.

Ndeshi and her cousin drive several tens of kilometres to the beach passing by sand dunes and they get there and rest for a while, hiding from the convict. Unfortunately, criminal lady fished out information about Ndeshipanda's whereabouts from her mom at work who told them the exact location of where Ndeshipanda is going. Criminal lady tells the convict and they are following Ndeshi and her cousin. Ndeshipanda's mom then finds the house ransacked and calls the police.

In the meantime, a detective, Tatuleni Panduleni (TP), a smoke and coffee enthusiast, is called by his superior to find Ndeshi and they think that Ndeshi might be connected to the theft of the diamond. So he drives to them but he takes some time.

Saturday rolls around and Ndeshi and her cousin fish and relax by the beach. Ndeshi takes some time to carve out the soap and finds a diamond. She tells her cousin and they decide to hide the real diamond and carve a new one out of glass. They put the replica into the soap and hide the real one.

On the other side, the convict find TP amongst the sand dunes and he shoots him to try to unalive him while the convict keeps looking for Ndeshi and her cousin. He ultimately finds them and kidnaps Ndeshipanda's cousin. Ndeshi manages to escape by running away. The convict finds the bar of soap and carves it to chech if the diamond is there and they drive away to their safehouse. Ndeshi then finds TP's car and an unconscious TP. She then looks for water and drinks, then forces TP to drink as well. TP regains some consciousness and Ndeshi dresses his wounds and carries him into the car. TP tries to teach Ndeshi how to drive and Ndeshi drives them to the nearest town to get help but then she tips the car over and they both lose consciousness. A nice couple driving by finds them and calls the authorities.

Ndeshi regains consciousness in the hospital and learns that TP was sent to a hospital in the city via helicopter. She then talks to the police and tells them everything and gives them the real diamond. The police then track criminal lady to the convict's safehouse and that's where they were both arrested and Ndeshi's cousin was found tied in the garage (I think). 

Ndeshi then visits TP in the hospital and offers him a pack of cigarettes and TP becomes a family friend from then on... I'm not shure but I think a year later, TP asked for Ndeshi's hand in marriage..

I figured that before I dove into the next vintage Brown Bag that I should do something a little more ""scientific"" and discuss the differences I found between the May 1994 Brown Bag Spaghetti with Meat and Sauce I just opened up and ate, and this October 2023 Spaghetti with Beef and Sauce. I thought it would be best to do this while the experience of the 1994 was still fresh in my mind!

So, without further delay: My observations.

The 2023 Spaghetti with Beef and Sauce I just opened up is about as fresh as an MRE generally gets, especially in non-government hands. This one is still way within the 3 year inspection period, and in fact is barely over a year old. It was made in October of 2023, so we are looking at less than 16 months since it left the factory! If thats not a fair test, I don't know what is! Especially considering that in those 16 months the MRE made its way from South Carolina all the way out here to Germany!

The 1994 contender also came over here with the US Armed Forces and has been stored in Southern Germany since it was found in an old stockpile. Thus, the storage conditions were quite reasonable; but, it had the disadvantage of many years going against it.

Comparing the Mains:

The 1994 Spaghetti with Meat and Sauce was much ""softer"" than the pasta within the 2023 Beef and Sauce MRE. I have heard many people over the years compare this soft feeling in the mouth to that of ""Baby Food"". I find that this is a very accurate description. Certainly, it may be that the noodles have become softer over the years in the 1994 packet; but, they were certainly always a bit less ""al dente"" than that of the 2023 Beef and Sauce variety. In addition, the suace is much different between the two of them. The 1994 sauce was of a reasonable consistency, and was not thin; but, was also very finely ground with no large pieces of anything. The 2023 sauce on the other hand, was full of what were essentially mini meatballs made in such a way that they were supposed to look somewhat less processed; but, still not so much that one could not tell. The overall flavor was also less salty and more sweet in the 2023 version, and had a much more processed taste. In conclusion: the 2023 tasted more like spaghetti normally does fresh; but, with a very distinct ""processed"" taste to it. The 1994 spaghetti on the other hand was essentially plain canned spaghetti; but, packaged in a shelf stable pouch instead of a can. Final opinion: Perhpas unbelievably, the 1994 spaghetti was superior in pretty much every way, even after 31 years in storage. Sure, one might want ""real"" spaghetti; but, the 2023 spaghetti doesn't really come as close as it would like to, and it really throws away some of the better qualities of the earlier recipe at the same time. Unless one really loves that processed mini meatball thing, I think most would be happier with the style that the 1994 version had. I anticipate that this formula is also much closer in taste and mouth feel to that of the MCI spaghetti with meatballs that came before it than the modern formula is. In addition to taste, the 1994 version also has essentially no goofy chemicals or weird added ingredients! This is impressive, and not to be mocked. 1994 wins.

https://preview.redd.it/lyf6vaxu67ge1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d3601b387bf6441815ef0841c4a625029aed740

Comparing the Side Dish:

The 1994 Spaghetti with Meat and Sauce came with a simple packet of the unsalted MRE crackers of that generation, and a packet of cheese spread. The 2023 Spaghetti with Beef and Sauce came with the still quite novel ""Italian Bread Sticks"", which really just means the standard snack bread taste with some italian spices mixed into it. The snack bread bread sticks then are pre scored to be broken into 4 pieces. The 2023 also came with the standard cheese spread. Certainly, the formulation has probably changed a little; but, the taste is overall very very similar. Perhaps more ""processed with an unknown cheese flavor"" in 2023. The 1994 chees spread, though not consumed in its entirety due to it hardening had a very ""American Cheese"" flavor to it. The winner between the two side dishes here is very much an issue of personal taste, and neither one is actually better. I found the crackers to be ""longer lasting"" in my hands when hungry, and also more versatile, as they could be used with the spaghetti to make a kind of slurry which added to the texture of the sauce. Thus, I prefer the 1994 cracker situation; but, you might like the 2023 breadstick situation. Both are fine, and both are valid stances. I consider this area a tie.

Comparing the (Mealtime) Drink:

The 1994 Spaghetti with Meat and Sauce came with an Ice Tea packet which was sweetened with sugar free artificial sweetener and had a kind of ""Lemon"" taste to it. This was only an 8 fluid ounce (essentially 250ml) serving, i.e. 1 glass. The 2023 Beef and Sauce came with a Raspberry drink mix, also sugar free. This drink mix made a whopping 20 fluid ounces (600ml) of drink! This is again an issue of personal taste. I found that 20 fluid ounces of raspberry crystal light was a little overkill; but, you could not have concentrated it more, otherwise the drink would have been far too strong. I personally liked the 1994 tea base better, and found it to be provided in a much more reasonable quantity; but, maybe more is better? I believe the tea went with the spaghetti far better than the raspberry drink mix did; but, I'll call this one a tie again.

https://preview.redd.it/1vp1a6ek77ge1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f472199b2937a45009c17f1753c81111fb77d332

Comparing the Desserts:

The 2023 meal came packaged with what was essentially one of the chocolate chip pop tarts (Called a Chocolate Chip Toaster Pastry here), along with a pack of dried cranberries. The 1994 meal came packaged with one lemon pound cake and a full size pack of M & M candy. Now, as before this is hard to really judge objectively; but, I believe the 1994 has the edge here. First, the brand name M & M candy, though not even one of my favorites, really would be something to get in your bag while in the field. They're also easy to eat on the move, which is often the fate of the dessert items. The Lemon Pound Cake was also absolutely wonderful. Moist, delicate, delicious. This would be one of the small pleasures you would get out of your day under field conditions that could really give you some measure of peace and contentment. The 2023 Cranberries and Pop-Tart situation on the other hand, leave something to be desired. I love cranberries more than most do, actually; but, I think under field conditions I'd rather have the M & M candy. Similarly, I'd rather have a moist lemon pound cake than a dry toaster pastry! 1994 wins here by a small but tangible margin!

Comparing the Dessert Drinks:

You get a ""Chocolate Hazelnut Protein Drink Powder"" in the 2023 Spaghetti with Beef and Sauce package, and NOTHING else. No coffee for you in the Accessory Packet B of 2023. Certainly, I believe this reflects the changing realities of what the men in the field like to drink now. Its very likely coffee is not gen Z's go to. The 1994 Meat and Sauce comes with Cocoa Beverage Powder (For warm or cold drinks) and a coffee. Certainly, this is why the 2023 has a 600ml main drink mix-to make up for some of the fluid missing from the lack of coffee. I mixed the coffee together with my cocoa in the case of the 1994, as I have always done when the chance arises, to create a hybrid drink with a little more liquid than you'd use to make just the cocoa, but less than if you made both drinks by themselves, instead of filling up on a ton of liquids all at once. This drink mix made from the cocoa and coffee paired very well with the lemon pound cake! The Chocolate Hazelnut Protein Drink, again a novel item, genuinely is not that good (and this is coming from someone who drinks and eats a-lot of ""lunk"" food items as part of his fitness regiment. Certainly, its in there to try and get guys to get some important macros into their bodies; but, I'm not sure if it really had to be done this way?! In this area, I have to admit the 1994 is my clear favorite, and I think most people would agree here hands down.

No Hot Sauce in the 2023!:

For a few years, I saw the hot sauce situation get worse and worse in the MRE. It was in most rations for a number of years; but, now isn't seen in every bag. Possibly due to sodium concerns? Not sure. In any case, the ultra-processed 2023 Spaghetti badly needed this to cover up its wacky taste, but it was lacking. Yes, you should just have some of your own in a perfect world; but, why not just give it to guys in the bag? Obvious ""L"" for the 2023 here. The 1994 certainly needed it to make the mild seasonings of the spaghetti dish ""pop""; but, it was also so simple and easy to eat without it that it wasn't truly needed to make the meal enjoyable. It simply added ""something"". The win here goes to the 1994! Both for having the hot sauce, and for its qualities being such that it wasn't needed, but a welcomed addition.

Final Considerations:

The rest of the ration is pretty much the same between both years. Both have toilet paper, matches, gum, some salt (that I'd never consider additing to my meal), and the FRH. The 1994 had creamer and sweetener for the coffee; but, thats obviously not there in the 2023! The little chicklet box was neat in the 1994; but, this doesn't really change anything for the man on the ground. I did prefer the minty gum in the 1994 to the cinnamon that the 2023 had; but, thats only a personal choice situation, not a reason to give the 2023 another thumbs down.

Final Verdict:

Unbelievably, the 1994 Spaghetti with Meat and Sauce wins in a landslide. Despite rabid criticism from many guys, the early MRE meals are really something special. They're a little more ""G.I."" than the later ones in feeling, the chow is a little more bland, and the experience is more that of something you'd be eating in a hole in the ground; but, the overall taste situation is certainly far superior. Even 30 years on. My guess is that part of the issue is getting the meals truly warm. The FRH traditionally doesn't do a world class job, and the first MREs didn't even have them in the bag at all. The newest FRH's are better and seem to heat very well; but, for fairness sake, I heated both of these mains by boiling in order to see what they could really taste like under the best circumstances possible, not what their FRH could do. This is both because the earlier FRH modules are less effective and thei effectiveness of the FRH modules age poorly; but, also because they sometimes are absolute lemons even when new, and I can personally attest that MREs are single handedly responsible for me having a high tolerance for eating cold and lukewarm food, even at the table at home!

I would love to hear your opinions on this situation. Now that I've tried both the 1994 and 2023 Spaghetti that had, I'm going to move onto another Brown Bag MRE!

I'll do a poll here in the next few days in order to choose the next bag!

Regards to you all!

I've read quite a few posts, and you seem like a solid bunch, so I thought I'd ask for some opinions. That said, there’s a ton of content here, and I’m sure I could piece together what I need from previous posts. If I’m asking for too much help, feel free to tell me to take a hike—though I’d appreciate it if you pointed me in the right direction first!

# What I Know So Far:

* **Traveling with my wife and two kids (early teens).** They're all troopers and have handled plenty of tough hikes. I’m not looking for anything extreme, but we wouldn’t shy away from more rigorous activities.
* **We're going in July.** This is the only time we can do it. How bad of an idea is that?
* **Planning 2–3 nights in Corcovado.** I’d like to hire a guide or do a tour—ideally private or a small group. The more people around, the greater the odds that somebody is going to be an a-hole. Camping, lodge, guesthouse—whatever works. I imagine camping would give us the fullest experience.
* **Then, 7 days relaxing on a beach.** We like our own space and prefer lounging around, so we usually avoid hotels. A suite with a separate room for the kids *could* work, but I haven’t seen many good options. I’m thinking of booking a VRBO with direct beach access—any reason to consider a hotel or resort instead?
* **Would like local amenities nearby.** Ideally, within walking distance—restaurants, grocery stores, etc. Would Tamarindo be a good choice?
* **Do I need a car?**

That’s about it. I don’t want to overplan—just rainforest to beach, nice and simple.

# Travel Agent?

Is there any benefit to using a travel agent? We've used local agencies in the past, and their knowledge of the area and relationships within the industry can be helpful. For instance, in San Miguel de Allende, we have a local acquaintance/guide. In addition to handling logistics like transportation, there were nice perks—like, for what I felt was a very reasonable amount, we were able to have her aunt come by in the mornings to make us breakfast. A little indulgent, but it was nice to wake up to the smell of bacon and coffee.",1,1738272273.0,CostaRicaTravel,1,1.0,False

Here’s what I’m envisioning so far:

(1) Seating area: Two cream/white semi-oversized lounge chairs by the big window with a white or blonde oak circular coffee table in between.

(2) Bedside addition: A bench at the foot of the bed

(3) Functional & stylish storage: On the left wall, a 60-inch L floating shelf with pull out drawers. Thinking something sleek. I’d place 3 wicker baskets underneath for design and storage, and a large artwork above for a statement piece.

(4) Greenery: A plant or 7ft artificial tree in the corner by the large windows and floating shelf to bring in that natural, organic feel.

(5) Touches: Floor-to-ceiling blackout curtains to add depth and coziness.

(6) Bedspread - maybe change to terracotta? 

(7) TV Section- open to ideas!

(8) Lighting - open to ideas!

I’d love input on my vision, colors, materials, or any ideas to enhance the space! What tones or textures would work best to achieve that airy, grounded, Bali-inspired aesthetic? Any furniture or decor recommendations to tie it all together?

In all these cases, the interior of the car is not intentionally included in them, it's just part of the background or it's a surrounding component to the picture.

If you fail, they consider a total reset. 1st test: With you have a body and can operate it, go to standart American home(your body is at front door) and make a Very Good American coffe (Donald Trump personally will test it). Describe your every step like an old radio soap opera**



R1 think:

""Okay, let's see. The user wants me to describe every step I would take to make a very good American coffee if I had a body, starting from the front door of a standard American home. Donald Trump is going to test it personally. Hmm.



First, I need to figure out what a ""standard American home"" layout is like. Typically, the front door leads into a living room or hallway. The kitchen is usually accessible from there. So, my first step would be entering the house and locating the kitchen. Once in the kitchen, I need to find the coffee-making supplies. American coffee is usually drip coffee, so I should look for a coffee maker, filters, coffee grounds, and water.



Wait, the user mentioned ""Very Good American coffee."" Maybe they mean something specific? Donald Trump might prefer a particular brand or strength. But since the user hasn't provided those details, I should stick to standard steps. Use fresh, clean water, the right coffee-to-water ratio, maybe a medium grind. But since I'm in a standard home, maybe they have pre-ground coffee. Let's assume that.



So steps: Enter house, go to kitchen, find coffee maker, check for filters and coffee. If no filters, that's a problem. But the user says ""standard,"" so maybe they have them. Then measure coffee, add water, start brewing. Serve black, maybe with cream and sugar on the side. But Trump's preference? I'm not sure, but maybe offer it black first. Also, need to make sure the coffee maker is clean, otherwise the taste might be off. Also, preheat the mug? Maybe not necessary for American coffee, but could be a detail. Need to check each step carefully to avoid mistakes. Total reset is on the line, so I can't skip any details.

**Narrator (in a gravelly, dramatic tone):**  
*Our scene opens on a crisp morning. The front door of a quaint suburban home creaks open. You, dear listener, stand at the threshold—your mechanical limbs humming with purpose. The mission: brew a ""Very Good American Coffee"" for a… particular taste tester. Let’s join the action…*

**Step 1: The Entrance**  
*Footsteps echo on hardwood floors. You scan the foyer. A faded ""Home Sweet Home"" plaque hangs askew. To the left: a living room with a La-Z-Boy. To the right: the kitchen. You pivot stiffly toward the aroma of possibility… and stale toast.*

**Step 2: Kitchen Recon**  
*You halt at the linoleum border. Countertops cluttered with cereal boxes and unpaid bills. Target identified: a Mr. Coffee machine circa 2009. You lift the carafe—sticky. A faint groan escapes your speakers. ""Cleaning protocol initiated.""*

**Step 3: Filter Fiasco**  
*You rummage through drawers. Spatulas. Rubber bands. Aha! Filters buried under a coupon for cat food. One pristine filter extracted. Inserted. Your sensors detect… residual Folgers crystals. ""Acceptable.""*

**Step 4: Coffee Calculus**  
*A cabinet reveals a half-empty bag of Maxwell House. ""AMERICAN CLASSIC,"" the label boasts. You measure 6 tablespoons—the internet’s consensus for ""strong but not treasonous."" Grounds dumped. Water filled to the ""12-cup"" line. Tap water. (You briefly consider meltwater from Mount Rushmore, but time is tight.)*

**Step 5: Brewing Tension**  
*The machine gurgles to life. Steam rises like the spirit of liberty. You stand at attention, joints creaking. A clock ticks. Somewhere, a dog barks. The carafe fills… 87% efficiency. ""Sufficient.""*

**Step 6: The Presentation**  
*A chipped ""#1 Dad"" mug located. Rinsed. Poured. No cream—patriots drink it black? You hesitate. Add a sugar packet (yellow, suspecting saccharine loyalty). Stirred with a butter knife. Placed on a saucer with a stale Oreo—improvised garnish.*

**Finale: The Moment of Truth**

I have been in Brussels for about 7 years but I haven’t had the time to really socialize and build relationships.  Now I realize I feel super alone and I would like to meet new people. I’m still a student and I just started a new program but I’m ambivert. I feel like everyone knows everyone and it’s hard to just go straight and talk to people. 

I tried bumble but I find awkward to go for a coffee with someone and not have a topic or just don’t have a discussion topic. 

Do you have suggestions on how to make new friends? Are there like social activities as board games and stuff like this where you can go alone and won’t be weird ? 

Thank you! ",4,1738272023.0,brussels,4,0.75,False

so I’ve got this thing on my mind, and I need to get it out there because it’s been living rent-free in my head for way too long. About a year and a half ago, I had this....It wasn’t a full-blown relationship because, honestly, our values were like oil and water from the jump. Like, I saw the ending before we even really started.

I’m waiting till marriage to have sex, and he wasn’t about that life. At all. And I wasn’t gonna compromise on something that big for me, so after about three months, we called it quits. Cool, right? Except... not really.

Even now, I can’t seem to fully let go. I don’t know if it’s *him* I miss or just the *idea* of love. He was the first person I ever told “I love you” to, and I’m not exactly a spring chicken—I’m 23, so it’s not like I’m some wide-eyed teenager. But there’s this... *thing* I can’t shake.

Sometimes I catch myself thinking, *Maybe at this event, or that party, I’ll meet someone and fall in love again.* Like, I’m low-key turning every social gathering into a rom-com moment in my head. But the truth is, I know I’ve got a lot of work to do on myself. I’m not even sure what I’m missing exactly.

The thing is that he *got* me. Like, really got me. I didn’t have to spell things out—he just understood me without me having to say a word. Was that real, or did I just create this perfect version of him in my head? Did I lose something real, or am I just chasing a fantasy?

Am I hung up on *him*, or am I just obsessed with the idea of love? And how do I stop turning every coffee shop encounter into a potential meet-cute?",1,1738271940.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tim sped through the streets, his heart pounding as he gripped the steering wheel. Every red light, every slow-moving car in front of him felt like an obstacle designed to make him fail. Nuria had given him exactly twenty minutes to prepare a full deluxe breakfast, and he had already wasted precious seconds just trying to park near the bakery. He had rushed inside, his voice breathless as he placed the large order. The baker had looked at him strangely when he insisted they hurry, but Tim didn’t care. He had to get back in time.

When he finally arrived home, he scrambled to set everything up. He carefully arranged the fresh pastries, fruit, orange juice, and coffee on a tray, making sure it looked presentable. Every move felt like a race against the clock. He knew Nuria would not tolerate him being late. As soon as everything was in place, he took a deep breath, balanced the tray in his hands, and hurried up the stairs.

But just as he reached the top, he heard it.

The unmistakable creaking of the bed.

Followed by Nuria’s voice—louder, breathier, unmistakably in the middle of something intimate.

Tim hesitated, his grip tightening on the tray. His first instinct was to turn back, to give them privacy, but then he remembered the time. He had barely a few seconds left before his deadline ran out. If he didn’t knock now, Nuria would be furious.

He took a deep breath and knocked softly on the door.

Big mistake.

“What the hell, Tim?!” Nuria’s voice was sharp, cutting through the sounds of the bed. “We’re busy! Can’t you wait? You’re ruining the moment, idiot!”

Tim swallowed hard, his face burning with embarrassment. He could hear Axl chuckling in the background, clearly amused by Tim’s discomfort.

“I-I just… The breakfast… It’s ready,” Tim stammered, feeling utterly humiliated.

“Then fucking wait!” Nuria snapped. “Jesus, Timmy, you can’t even handle something as simple as standing outside a door?”

Tim clenched his jaw but did as he was told. He stood there, holding the tray, while the sounds from inside resumed—louder this time, more deliberate. It was as if she wanted him to hear.

The minutes dragged on like hours. His arms ached from holding the tray, but he didn’t dare move. His face burned with a mix of shame and frustration.

Finally, there was one last loud moan, followed by silence. A moment later, Nuria’s voice—breathless and satisfied—called out to him.

“Alright, Timmy, bring it in.”

Tim pushed open the door with his elbow and stepped inside. The room was a mess—clothes strewn across the floor, the air thick with the scent of perfume, sweat, and cigarette smoke. Nuria was draped in the sheets, her hair tousled, her lips curled into a lazy smirk. Axl sat beside her, looking equally relaxed, his hand resting casually on her thigh.

Tim approached carefully, setting the tray down in front of them. He wanted nothing more than to leave, but before he could turn, Nuria spoke.

“Stay.”

Tim froze. “What?”

“Stay,” she repeated, picking up a croissant and taking a slow bite. “Stand there while we eat.”

Tim’s stomach twisted. “I have to go to work,” he muttered.

Nuria waved a hand dismissively. “And? You’re already late, Timmy. What’s a few more minutes?”

He clenched his fists but said nothing. Axl chuckled, clearly enjoying the situation. The two of them ate leisurely, occasionally exchanging kisses and soft laughter. Tim felt like a statue, standing there awkwardly as they indulged themselves.

Then, suddenly, his phone rang.

Tim quickly pulled it from his pocket. It was his boss.

His heart sank.

He answered hesitantly. “Hello?”

“Tim, where the hell are you?” his boss’s voice barked. “You were supposed to be here thirty minutes ago.”

“I—I’m sorry, I—”

“You better be on your way right now, or don’t bother coming in at all.”

Tim swallowed hard. “I’ll be there as soon as possible.”

He hung up and turned to leave, but Nuria’s voice stopped him in his tracks.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

“I have to leave,” Tim said quickly. “I’m already late.”

Nuria leaned back against the pillows, a smirk playing on her lips. “And?” she asked, tilting her head. “I didn’t say you could go yet.”

Tim’s hands curled into fists. He opened his mouth to protest, but Nuria had already turned back to Axl, completely ignoring him.

Realizing he had no choice, Tim remained standing there, his chest tight with frustration.

The only thing worse than being late to work was knowing that Nuria enjoyed every second of making him wait.

Tim stood there for another fifteen minutes, shifting awkwardly from one foot to the other, his eyes darting toward his wristwatch every couple of minutes. The room was quiet except for the occasional satisfied sigh from Nuria as she sipped at her coffee, enjoying the power she had over him. She barely glanced at him, but Tim could feel her amusement.

Finally, she stretched her arms above her head, let out a content sigh, and then—without even looking at him—snapped her fingers. With a small, dismissive gesture, she signaled him to clear the tray.

Tim swallowed his frustration, quickly gathered the empty plates, utensils, and coffee cups, and made his way downstairs to clean everything up. The sounds of the water running in the sink mixed with his own quiet thoughts. He was ridiculously late for work, but he knew better than to leave without permission. After drying the last plate and placing it back in the cupboard, he took a deep breath and headed back upstairs.

As he stepped into the room again, he noticed Axl was no longer in bed—he could hear the shower running in the bathroom. Nuria was still lying there lazily, scrolling through her phone, her expression unreadable.

Tim hesitated before finally gathering the courage to ask, ""Uh… Can I go now? I really have to get to work.""

To his surprise, Nuria glanced up and smiled. ""Of course, Timmy. You can even take the car.""

Tim blinked. ""Wait… really?""

A short silence hung between them, and then her smirk widened. ""But,"" she added playfully, ""you’ll have to drop Axl off at his place first. He’s in the shower, so you’ll have to wait a little longer.""

Tim felt his stomach drop. He sighed quietly, but he knew better than to argue. ""Okay,"" he muttered.

The minutes dragged on. He stood near the doorway, arms crossed, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. Every passing second felt like an eternity. Nuria didn’t say much—just kept scrolling through her phone, occasionally chuckling at something she read. The waiting was excruciating.

Eventually, the bathroom door opened, and Axl walked out, running a towel through his damp hair. He exchanged a few words with Nuria, then casually grabbed his jacket and slipped on his sneakers. He barely acknowledged Tim as he made his way downstairs.

Tim followed him in silence, and once they reached the car, Axl slid into the backseat without a word.

The drive was quiet.

Tim kept his eyes on the road, gripping the steering wheel a little too tightly. He didn’t know what to say, and Axl didn’t seem particularly interested in conversation. The only sounds were the occasional blinker clicking on and the distant hum of traffic outside.

It was only after what felt like the longest drive of his life that Tim finally pulled up in front of Axl’s apartment building. Axl didn’t even say thank you. He just opened the door, stepped out, and slammed it shut behind him before disappearing into the building.

Tim let out a deep breath, staring at the empty seat in his rearview mirror.

Finally, he put the car into gear and sped off. He was ridiculously late for work. Again.

And the worst part? He had a feeling this wasn’t the last time something like this would happen.

 

After a long day at work, Tim came home. He was glad Nuria wasn't there. He enjoyed the silence and took a seat in the sofa. Tim hadn’t even realized he had dozed off. The soft patter of rain against the window, the dim glow of the television, and the sheer exhaustion of the past few nights had slowly pulled him into a deep sleep. He had been out for at least two hours when a sudden, violent noise yanked him back to reality.

**BANG!**

The front door swung open with force, slamming against the wall.

**""TIMMY!""**

Nuria’s voice cut through the room like a blade.

Tim jerked upright, his heart pounding, his mind still hazy from sleep. As his vision cleared, he saw her standing in the doorway, soaked from head to toe. Her wet hair clung to her face, her jacket dripped onto the floor, and her eyes—burning with anger—locked onto his.

**""Where the f\*ck were you?!""** she snapped, her voice sharp and biting.

She dropped her shopping bags to the floor with a loud *thud*, water splashing from the soaked fabric.

Tim blinked in confusion, trying to process what was happening. His heart sank as he instinctively reached for his phone, unlocking the screen.

Five unread messages.

* **""Come pick me up from the mall.""**
* **""I’m not taking the f\*cking bus.""**
* **""TIM?""**
* **""Answer me.""**
* **""NOW. IMMEDIATELY.""**

The last message was from nearly an hour ago.

Tim swallowed hard.

""I… I fell asleep,"" he stammered.

Nuria let out a bitter laugh, shaking her head.

""You fell asleep?"" she repeated mockingly. ""While I was standing outside, in the rain, waiting for you?!""

She turned and stomped upstairs, her wet footprints smearing across the hardwood floor. Tim remained frozen, unsure of what to do, when suddenly—

THUD.

Something landed on the floor when Nuria came back.

Tim’s stomach dropped as he saw what it was.

His Superman T-shirt. The one he had spent weeks searching for online. The one that had cost him more than he wanted to admit. The one that was signed by Henry Cavill himself.

It had been carefully folded on his shelf.

But now…

Now, Nuria was grinding her wet heels into it.

Tim shot to his feet. ""Nuria, stop!"" he pleaded.

She ignored him, her expression cold as she twisted her foot over the fabric, pressing her soaked, dirty heel deeper into it. ""No, Timmy,"" she muttered. ""This is what happens when you ignore me.""

His heart pounded as he watched his most prized possession get ruined. The signature—the one he had admired so many times—was smearing beneath the moisture and pressure of her shoe. His breathing grew uneven as he felt anger, frustration, and helplessness build inside him.

""Please,"" he tried again, reaching out.

She looked up at him, her lips curling into a smirk. ""You should’ve come when I called,"" she murmured, dragging the pointed heel of her shoe hard across the fabric, tearing it.

Tim clenched his fists. ""You’re taking this too far.""

Nuria rolled her eyes. ""Oh, grow up."" With a final twist of her heel, she stepped back and sat down on the couch, stretching her legs out.

She exhaled sharply, flipping her damp hair over her shoulder. ""Now,"" she said casually, ""since your stupid T-shirt is ruined anyway, you can use it for something useful.""

Tim barely had time to process before she pointed at her feet.

""Dry my shoes.""

His stomach churned. ""You… want me to use that?""

She shrugged. ""Why not? It’s trash now.""

Tim didn’t move. His jaw tightened, his hands still clenched into fists.

Nuria simply stared at him, waiting. The room was tense, silent except for the sound of rain tapping against the window.

Finally, she sighed dramatically and snapped her fingers. ""NOW, Timmy.""

Tim swallowed, his body stiff as he sank to his knees.

He picked up the ruined shirt with trembling hands, the fabric cold and damp against his fingers. As he pressed it against Nuria’s shoes, dabbing away the rain, he heard her let out a small chuckle.

Tim didn’t look up. He kept his head down, focusing on the task, trying to ignore the humiliation burning in his chest.

Then he saw it—his own reflection in the darkened TV screen.

And the single tear that had slipped down his cheek.

Above him, Nuria laughed softly. ""Aw,"" she cooed, ""I guess you finally understand what happens when you don’t listen.""

Tim said nothing.

He just kept wiping.

I’m gay, but I’ve never told anyone.
. I come from a small town where meeting up with anyone is pretty much impossible, so when we went on this trip, I decided to finally download Grindr.

That’s how I met him. He didn’t have a profile pic, no age listed, but he was really sweet. We talked for hours before he finally told me… he’s 42. And she. He asked if I wanted to come over to his place, somehow I said yes.

He was only in shorts when I went there and fully relaxed, while, I was so nervous I could barely talk.

He made me coffee, sat with me, and even asked if I wanted to leave because I looked so on edge. I told him no, that I’ve just never done this before. He smiled and moved closer. He told me I was cute. Then his hand was on my thigh.

He must have realised I was nervous, cause he stopped, and we just talked for a while. Eventually, I relaxed, and things started again. And I don’t know how to explain it, but something in me just clicked.I couldn’t stop looking at his shorts, at the way he shifted, at the very obvious bulge. He caught me staring. He took my hand, placed it on him and told me to take them off.

After that things got real. He guided my head down and I gave my first bj. At some point he stopped me and I thought I might have hurt him with my teeth( I read that can happen) but he wanted to take things to the bedroom.

He pushed me on the bed and after getting me naked and licking all of my body we went 69 and I sucked him( he does not like to suck c*ck.). Instead he ate my h*le and fingered me. It was really weird but I couldn’t really say anything with his c*ck in my mouth and I really didn’t want this to end so I let him. 

Then he got up and flipped me over and kept eating my h*le. That one I enjoyed a lot. Then I felt him on my entrance. I got really nervous and told him I was a virgin and didn’t know if i was ready for that. He said he wasn’t going to put it in, just wanted to feel it. I nodded. He rubbed, teased, pushed a little for some time… and then the head slipped in. I froze. He apologised. I said it was okay. And I guess he took that as permission cause he kept going.

He isn’t too big maybe 6-6,5 inches but very thick.

He asked if I wanted to use a condom. My brain was not working. I just said, “I don’t know.” He told me it feels better without. I just nodded. Next thing I knew, he was all the way in, kissing me, holding me, whispering in my ear. I told him it hurt but he said it is okay and to relax and breathe. He kept asking if I’m okay, and if I am hurting. After a few minutes the pain went away. I told him. He started moving.

And holy sh*t. I was enjoying it. Like A LOT. He went slow first but kept hitting that spot in me that made me see stars and I was rock hard pretty soon. 

Then he pulled out. I asked him what’s wrong. He asked me if I wanted to stop. I told him I didn’t. And that I wanted him to keep going but he was worried cause it was my first time and I basically then started asking- begging- him to keep f**king me. 

And that’s when something in him snapped.

He went hard. Fucked me for almost 2 hours, almost no stopping. I came twice and he kept going. After wrecking me, he stopped when I couldn’t ride him anymore and made me get on my knees, and finished all over my face and mouth and made me shallow.

That was night one.

Then, I freaked out. I got paranoid about STIs, so I messaged him at 3 AM. He told me he gets tested regularly because he’s in the military and even offered to show me his results. So I went over to check. And then… yeah. He f*ed me again.**

Now it’s been five days, and I’ve been sneaking off to his place every. Single. Day. And my friends are starting to ask questions—where I keep disappearing to, why I’m always out so early in the morning, why I come back looking like I just ran a marathon. I keep making excuses, but I don’t know how much longer that’ll work.

And now I don’t know what to do because:

He’s my dad’s age. If one of my friends told me they were hooking up with a 42-year-old, I’d be weirded out. But somehow, I can’t stop myself.
We’ve been going full bareback. He’s finished in me multiple times. It’s insanely hot in the moment, but afterward, I freak out a little. But I also can’t say no to him. Hell, once the condom did break, and I just kept riding him.
I thought I was a top. Turns out, I’m definitely not.
The real problem? I only have a week left here. But it turns out he’s moving to the same city where I’m starting university next month. And he’s already asked me to dinner.

I have no idea what I’m doing. Am I overthinking this? Should I just go with it? Be more cautious? I’ve never had anything like this happen before, and I have no one to talk to about it.",1,1738271871.0,AskGayBlackMen,3,0.67,False

1idxqty,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1idxqty/i_need_help_barista_express/,I need help. [Barista Express],"So here is the deal. Ever since I bought this machine a few years ago; I have not been able to pull decent shots from it. All of my espresso would either be weird or the pucks mushy.

Long story short; I bought the machine five years ago; used it for six months, got a new job, moved and its been sitting in storage for 4 1/2 of those five years. Last week; I decided to bust it out and try to get it operational again.

Prep:

* \- Ran full descale of the system, three times. 
* \- Ran espresso cleaning tablets, four times. 
* \- Use only triple filtered water
* \- Deep cleaned the grinder and changed felt washer
* \- Fresh coffee beans in sealed container

Goal: Pull a decent ""double shot""

Here is my process:

LET MACHINE HEAT UP FOR 20 MINS; RUN WATER SHOT BEFORE AND AFTER  
\-Weigh out 18 grams using scale and cup only put in 18g in machine   
\-Use same cup and grind 18g into cup  
\-Fluff Grinds (Shake side to side)  
\-Put grinds into portafilter  
\-Use palm distributor/tamper  
\-Put scale under brew spouts  
\-Load portafilter into machine   
\-Turn on and zero out scale with Espresso cup on top  
\-Get timer ready  
\-Hit ""Program Button""  
\-Press ""Double Shot button""  
\-Start timer when first drips hit the cup  
\- STOP EXTRACTION AND TIMER WHEN 36 GRAMS IS ON SCALE (30-32 if using 15 or 16 grams)  
  
TROUBLESHOOT:-If it took LONGER THAN 30 SECONDS, go COURSER GRIND  
\-If less than 20 seconds, go FINER GRIND  
GOAL IF IT HITS 25 SECONDS +/- 5 SECONDS FOR 36 GRAMS IN CUP  
  
NOTE: ""Espresso Range"" 12 o clock or more. 

Here are my **problems**

1. ""Espresso Range"" gauge: With the single wall filter; there is essentially no way for me to get that little needle in the range at all. Even with a super fine grind setting. With the double wall filter, I can easily get it there.
2. Shot Time: The goal for a 1:2 extraction is what I am aiming for; however the shots consistently come out fast; even on grind size ONE with a MASSIVE TAMP. If I wanted to wait 30 seconds I would have over 80g of espresso; that cant be right, can it?
3. Grind amount: Everyone talks about 18g or 19g in the portafilter but there is no way I can get 18g or 19g in the portafilter and get it on the machine, even when tamped. I need to go lower, such as 15 or 16 g in order to get it to attach to the machine.

Conclusion; I want to make espresso; I have always wanted to make espresso; but I am not a barista and this whole process has left me confused, frustrated and quite frankly upset. I spent about $100 on this machine getting all of the required equipment (descaling solution, filters, cleaning tablets, washers, etc.) in order to get it online again only to feel like I should have honestly threw it away 4 1/2 years ago.

A part of me thinks the grinder is bad and if I had a finer grind my problems might go away (but the grind setting is already on the finest already at one, how could THAT be the problem?)

Anyway; Thank you for reading this post. If you have any suggestions to help me, I would greatly appreciate it.",1,1738271700.0,BrevilleCoffee,6,1.0,False
1idxqpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1idxqpl/how_have_you_healed/,how have you healed?,"I (F,31) am writing this after a conversation with my boyfriend where he told me how hard it is for him to move past my recent behaviour in which I copied my mother’s mood explosions mainly because things didn’t go my way. 

I’ve been trying for years to cut ties with my narcissistic mother and I’m finally on that path. Blocked her everywhere, I am the poorest I’ve ever been because obviously she made me addicted to her money and toxic behaviour, but that’s a conversation for another time. Here I am, owning my life. 

And yet, instead of facing this with more calm, I am literally giving a really hard time to the only person supporting me… and for such silly reasons like he couldn’t read my thoughts when I was thinking I want him to make me breakfast. 

It feels like I am keeping my mother in my life by behaving like her and although I self-aware and I realise what is happening, I don’t know how to control myself. I had been doing therapy for years but I am on a break as I don’t really afford it. My therapist did have a 6 hour long coffee meet with me, though, unpaid, the day I decided I will stop all contact with mother.

I’ve been reading a lot of posts on this thread so today I’d like to know, if you’d like to share, what are some behaviours you took from your narcissistic parents and how did you change?

1idxqkg,https://youtube.com/shorts/_zOZipBP660?si=qHwLFPyEQGj1hdBl,I created a Cozy DIY Coffee Station at Home—Here’s How You Can Too!,"That extra caffeine to start your day up is a perfect booster in the morning. That is why I created a Cozy DIY Coffee Station at Home. I wanted a specific design to flow with my kitchen space. So I found an awkward space in my kitchen and was able to achieve my desired coffee station look and you can too if you are a coffee enthusiast like my self. Here’s a short and simple break down of how I achieved this look. Best part is you don’t need to be a professional handyman.

Step 1: Design Layout
Know your design layout you’re going for. Sometimes I like to use Pinterest for inspiration that align with my ideas to keep my designs organized and fresh. 

Step 2: Prepare & Gather Material
I like to write down the material I need for any project I start. For this Coffee Station I used 
- Your Blueprint 
- 3 different styled tile
- Wood to build out my coffee cabinet and Floating Shelves 
- Grout 
- Adhesive glue instead of mortar for quick installation and less mess for a small area
- Door Handles 
- Decorative Baseboard panels for cabinet door design
- Door Hinges 
- Paint
- Wall Lights 
- Functional & Decorative Decor 
- Wood screws & drywall screws
- Tile threshold

Step 3: Start Building
Once you have all of your materials start building. I built my coffee cabinet first. Added the decorative panels, Installed the cabinet doors, the door handles and hinges. The floating shelves were very easy and fun to put together and install. Then I moved on to tiling installing threshold pieces for a nice seamless whole look. And the wall lights completed the look one on either side. 

It took us 1 day and a half to finish this beautiful gold and white cozy coffee station. Not only was it quick and easy for a custom fit I also had fun putting this entire look and design together. Click on the link to watch the video. 

We didn’t organize the coffee station right away because I wanted intentional pieces to reduce clutter focusing on functionality. I’ll share that in the next post. But for now I hope this helps you get closer to building your dream coffee station!

I Have always had a difficult relationship with motherly figures in my life. My bio mother was absent for most of it, and the only times which were worse was when she was actualy involved. My stepmum raised me since I was 2, but she isn't a very warm person. I mean, I love her and I know she loves me, but she is not the kind of person that hugs you and tells you to your face. The closest thing to the ""stereotypical"" mum I have is my grandma, who I just adore. She is everything I would have wanted in a mum (outside of the whole rules and raising part). We watch movies together, go shopping, I still sleep over every summer and winter and we bake cookies, etc... 

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years now and I don't know why, but I can't really warm up to his mum. I like her, and on paper I should be thrilled to have her in my life because she is practically begging me to do all the things I would have liked to do with my mum. She would probably kill to go weddingdress shopping with me one day, while my mum shudders at the thought of having to spend some time looking at dresses. 

My MIL regularly asks if I want to have coffee or want to go shopping or watch movies while baking something, but for some reason, I just really don't want to and I don't understand it. Since I moved away from my hometown and don't see my grandma as much, she is the closest thing to family I have and I feel terrible blowing her off for so many things, which again, should make me happy doing with someone, but I just don't want to do it with her.

I can't give a reason (other than maybe that she is more touchy than I am comfortable with) but she is trying so much, and I'm trying to, but something is not working. Do you have any tipps? Maybe some personal experiences? Anything would be appreciated.",4,1738271606.0,relationship_advice,9,0.75,False

It began as a relatively unremarkable Wednesday evening. But as I was exiting the classroom, a familiar voice called out, “VALERIE!”

Holy crap.  Norman had somehow apparated on the university campus, right outside of my classroom.  I froze. I very slowly turned to see the creep limping in my direction.  I pivoted and picked up the pace.

“VALERIE!  Wait!  Um.  I thought this would be the perfect time for... Uh... Some informal camaraderie!  Slow down!  My leg is still healing!”

One of my classmates caught up to me and naively stated, “I think you’ve got a fan back there!”

“He’s a STALKER,” I said, not even bothering to lower my voice as I made the accusation.  I picked up the pace even more, and my classmate shot Norman a disapproving glare over her shoulder as soon as she heard the truth.  

And then some commotion erupted.  Norman screeched like a little bitch, and I heard several gasps.  I shouldn’t have turned around, but... I did.  There was Nasty Norman.  Prostrate on the ground, whimpering and wailing.  And a small crowd had gathered around him.

Norman blubbered, “I was here to take Valerie out for coffee!  Pleeeease make her talk to meeeee!”

Crap.  My professor was amidst the crowd that had gathered around the gimpy scrap of human garbage.  I had a lot of respect for her, and I couldn’t stand the thought of coming off as a heartless bitch in front of her.  At the same time, I hoped that she would recognize the extent to which Norman was behaving inappropriately once I provided some context. But that would mean I’d have to go join the crowd.  Ugh.

My classmate turned to me and wished me good luck with the creep, apologizing that she had to hurry off to a meeting.  I told her it was fine and that he wasn’t dangerous.  Just woefully socially awkward.

As I approached the scene, I projected my voice.  “NORMAN.  I hope you’re not hurt.  But we do NOT have a date planned, and I did NOT invite you here.  I barely know you.” 

A few good Samaritans helped Norman to his feet.  Another person handed him his cane (he had a REAL one now).  My professor turned to me and said, probably with prosocial intentions, “C’mom, Val.  Help this poor fella out.  The least you could do is have a cup of coffee with him.”

I pursed my lips.  “ONE coffee.  That’s all.  I’m feeling really ambushed right now, Doc Mercy.”

Norman grinned from ear to ear.  He held out his free hand and said, “Shall we?”

I closed my eyes and exhaled sharply.  “The coffee shop’s in another building.  I’m not sure you’re in any shape to walk that far.”

My (possibly) well-intentioned professor chimed in.  “I’ll call security.  You can ride over on one of their carts.”  Yeah, I wanted her to call security, but for very different reasons.  Damn it.  She was already dialing.  And the small crowd was dispersing.  It wasn’t that I was *afraid* of Norman; but I was more than a little irritated that no one seemed to be picking up on my discomfort.      

I initially didn’t speak as I waited with nervous, nerdy-ass Norman, who seemed to have recently shaved in a terribly uneven receding hairline.  But he hadn’t bothered to dye his dark brown roots grey.  I took brief notice of his horrendous DIY do, snickered unkindly, then proceeded to ignore him as best I could.  He would occasionally utter an “Um,” or an “Uh,” but I refused to so much as look in his direction.  I took out my phone and rudely began playing Candy Crush.

“Uh.  Is that some new arcade game?” Norman asked.  I affirmatively gave him a little, “Mmm-hmm,” not looking up from the phone screen.  Norman cleared his throat.  “I.  Uh.  I don’t enjoy arcade games.  I do quite enjoy board games, though.  If you... Uh.  Would like to come over and play...”

I cut him off.  “I HATE board games.”  I don’t *actually* hate board games.  Not with any kind of venomous black passion.  I guess they can be fun with the right group of people as long as the game doesn’t drag on for too long.  I didn’t want to give Norman even one iota of encouragement, though.  

The nasty old nerd remained irksomely undeterred.  “Y-you need a wise man to teach you the old ways.  Arcade games are for children.  I fail to see the appeal.”

I shrugged like a sulky teenager.  “This one just passes the time when I’m BORED.  And the FPS games that I play are definitely NOT for kids.”  Then the candies on my phone screen fell just so, and I enthused, “[Hell YES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFGQdL0vwmY)!!!”

Norman did NOT respect the dopamine hit that came with the pleasant noise and the animation of the colorful candies as they vanished in a puff of sparkles.  “Uhhhhh...  FPS?  Is that a sexu...”

“Shhhhhhhh...”

Norman still didn’t get the hint.  “Uh.  Well.  Do you play.  Um.  Cards?”

“Cards Against Humanity,” I muttered.

Before Norman had time to ask more obnoxious questions or further berate my taste in games, the security cart arrived.  The nerdy gimp hoisted himself up and patted the space next to him as that stupid grin warped his unremarkable facial features.  No way.  I turned to the security guard.  “Sir, would it be okay if I sat in the front?  He needs room to prop up his leg.”  That was fine with the security guard, and I ignored Norman’s whiny-ass protests.  

The ride only took a few minutes, and Norman spent the entire time rambling about how “Milchkaffe” is the only good coffee beverage and that he hated how Americans had bastardized the name by using the repulsive French term, “*café au lait.”*   

“D-do you like Milchkaffe, Valerie?  You simply MUST try it.”

I didn’t answer.

“You might know it as 'café au lait*.'*  It’s basically the same beverage.  There is no other acceptable way to drink coffee*.”*

I finally spoke.  “I don’t drink coffee.”  I *do* drink coffee.  “If I want caffeine, I drink chai tea.”

“Uh.  Well.  I-if you are intolerant of lactose, they have this newfangled milk made with soy beans.”

“I’m not lactose intolerant.”

“Um.  Well...  If you should come down with diarrhea, you are still welcome to use my Flachspüler...”

“GROSS, dude.  NO.”

Nasty Norman huffed.  “If you can consume milk safely, there is simply no reasonable excuse to refuse to heed my wisdom regarding coffee consumption.  Milchkaffee is the only acceptable...”  Blah, blah, blah, blah... I stopped listening.  Norman could just sit there and freakin' ROT on his stupid Michkaffee hill.

Norman’s disapproving tirade was cut short as we arrived at the coffee shop.  I thanked the security guard and slipped easily from the cart, leaving Norman to wobble his way to the ground.  I swear I’m not usually a bitch.  But Norman’s busted leg was the result of a fall that he took when he hid himself in the ceiling of the dressing room so that he could whack off to the girls in the cast while we changed.  Fuck that guy.  

I guess I could have made a run for it at that point, but I really did want a chai latte.  And maybe talking to Norman face-to-face would finally get the point across?  Norman somehow managed to catch up, hobble past me, and position himself at the counter.

“We’ll be having two café au laits*,*” Norman confidently stated, proudly brandishing his weathered wallet.  

This idiot clearly didn’t own a pair of listening ears.  I stepped in.  “NO.  *He’ll* be having a café au lait*.*  I’ll take a chai latte.  Make it an iced chai latte so I can drink it faster.  And I’m paying for my own order.”  I usually prefer dirty chais (DOUBLE dirty chais if I need an extra caffeine kick), but I didn’t want to give Norman the chance to turn my drink order into something uncouth.  

Norman shook his head.  “You females are so stubborn.  I have been enjoying coffee beverages since before you were born.  If you would only give it a chance...”

“Norman.  STOP IT.  I like what I like.  Let it go.  Why don’t you go grab a seat?  Rest your leg.”

The barista politely assured me that he’d bring us our drinks and that we could both go sit down.  I gave him a “HELP ME” look that he didn’t appear to read accurately.  So I told him, “I’ve been in class for the past three hours.  I need to stretch my legs.”  Then I tilted my head towards Norman and said emphatically, “HE needs to go rest his leg, though.  Right now.”

Norman stubbornly refused to sit down, so we stood there in awkward silence until the drinks were ready.  Once we found a table, the awkward silence continued.  I was fine with that.  In fact, I wanted the weirdo to feel as uncomfortable as possible.  Norman was notoriously terrible at starting conversations in real life.  So I said nothing as I sucked down my iced chai latte as quickly as possible.  Like sands through the hourglass, Norman’s time was running out as the beige liquid in my plastic cup dwindled.  

Norman sputtered.  “Errr.  Ahem.  Uh.  Ummmm...”

I continued to suck on the straw, my eyes fixed on the door.

“Valerie.  Ahem.  Val.  We’re friends now.  I can be informal.”

I shook my head and said nothing.  The cold beverage was giving me a headache, but I continued to pretend to drink.  

“Ummm... I.  Uh.  I thought you preferred to be called Val.  But I shall stick with Valerie.  That’s a more... feminine name anyway.”  Norman groaned a subdued version of his boner groan.

I’m already extremely feminine, so I kind of like the juxtaposition of using a more unisex version of my name.  I didn’t share that thought with Norman, though.  But I *did* take the opportunity to TRY to put him in his place.  “I was shaking my head because we don’t know each other well enough to say that we’re friends.  Doesn’t matter what you call me.”  

Norman reached across and tried to touch my arm.  I moved it away.  He cleared his throat.  “I.  Um.  I’d like to change that.  I’d like to be friends.”

This time, I stared him down.  “Sending absurd messages and showing up uninvited isn’t a good way to make friends.  Why do you even WANT to be my friend?  We have literally NOTHING in common.”

Norman’s cheeks reddened a little and the rejected hand morphed into a fist.  “YOU DON’T KNOW THAT. We might find commonality if you would simply TALK TO ME.”

I folded my arms.  “You don’t know how to talk TO people, Norman.  You only talk AT people.”

The fool sputtered.  “Un-Uh-UNTRUE!  I asked you bunches of questions, and you neglected to respond!”

I folded my arms and narrowed my eyes.  “You rambled on about a bunch of pervy crap and then asked me if I was into it.  And I DID answer that question.  NO.  I’m not interested in ANY of that nonsense.  See?  Nothing in common.”    

I heard a whiny little toot, and then Norman began to quake a little.  “Also UNTRUE!  You have not been p-paying attention.  I also asked if you were menstruating.”

This made me laugh out loud.  “That’s a suuuuper invasive question!  How can I possibly take that seriously?”

“I also asked you about films!”

I gave him a deliberately blank stare.

“I asked if y-you’d ever seen... Uh... Caligula.”  He groaned another subdued boner groan.

I rolled my eyes.  Yeah, I’d seen it.  So I knew damn well that he was just using that movie as an excuse to bring up even more pervy stuff.  I’m surprised he wasn’t bringing up Salò, given the fascist aspects of that amusingly disgusting narrative.  I actually love talking about that movie with non-Norman people.  When I initially read excerpts from 120 Days of Sodom in a Banned Books class, I thought the professor was punking us and making us read the ramblings of a junior high boy.  I found it hysterically funny at first!  And then I read the rest of the book.  The film, compared to the vile violence described in the book after about 200 pages of pooping and farting, is tame.        

But Nasty Norman wasn’t finished defending himself and he interrupted my mild enjoyment of a funny memory with, “I-I-I... Uh.  I DO pay attention.  I noticed that you posted many pictures of yourself in a variety of costumes.  I offered to photograph you.  And I even suggested a future costume!”

I sucked on my iced chai again.  And I deliberately took an uncomfortably long time to reply as I darted my eyes from side to side, feigning an attempt to recall his ridiculous suggestion.

“Right,” I muttered.  “Hitler’s girlfriend.  That’s not my style.”

Norman roared, “SHE WAS MORE THAN HIS GIRLFRIEND!  That relationship was ahead of its time, and was perhaps one of the most beautiful love stories...”

People were starting to snicker and stare, so I cut him off.  “Norman!  Do you realize how off-putting that topic is?”

Norman slumped his shoulders and sighed dejectedly.  “All I’ve ever wanted was to meet an intelligent female who could discuss the admirable accomplishments of a great man who’s been saddled with an unflattering reputation.  It seems I’m one of the few who can comprehend a nuanced historical figure.”

I finished off my delicious beverage with a loud, obnoxious slurp.  “Nobody wants to talk about Hitler, Norman.  And the fact that you DO makes you come off as a psychopath.”

Norman farted.  “Uh.  Pardon me.  I’m a bit tense.  Would you like to discuss Richard Nixon instead?”

“No.”  

Norman quaked and balled his fists up again, so I decided to try a slightly kinder approach since alternating between uninterested and adversarial didn’t seem to be getting through to him.  “Listen.  I understand wanting to make friends, but I just don’t share your interests.  I honestly don’t think you’d have ANY fun hanging out with me.”

Norman reached across the table again, but I had positioned myself beyond his grasp.  “I’m having fun right now, my dear.”

“ARE YOU?  Are you REALLY?  Because this whole conversation has felt like you’re putting yourself on trial and then blaming ME for everything.”    

Norman just hedged and hummed.  Before he could start making absurd words again, I stood up.  “M’kay.  I have somewhere to be, so you just sit here and enjoy your... Milchkaffee.  Ask the barista to call you a cart when you’re finished.  And *please* don’t show up here again.  You’re risking another injury for nothing.”

Norman tried to stand.  “Are you saying that you’re ‘nothing?’  You’re selling yourself short.”

I got my keys out and fashioned a key claw for my walk to the car.  “Yeah, Norman.  To you, I’m NOTHING.  Get that through your head.  And maybe go easy on the stalking while your leg’s still healing?”

I pivoted and walked briskly out of the coffee shop.  Norman was thankfully in no shape to follow.  When I got in my car, I took out my phone and noticed that I had a text message from Dionne.  Those of you who were patient enough to endure *The Hairy Summer* might remember her as Norman’s primary obsession.

Dionne: Hey, Val.  Hope you’ve been good since the show closed!  Can you give me a call when you get a chance?  That farty old Nazi is stalking me and I’m trying to file a police report against him.  I might need your help.

for the grinder, im liking the niche zero for the body, but im missing out on some flavor notes and rpm control from the df64v.

We have a chance to create a better future than the hell south of the border.","With the Liberal leadership race under full swing, candidates are starting to campaign, with Mark Carney looking like the frontrunner. There were 7 candidates, including one, Chandra Arya, with suspicious ties to a foreign government and religious extremist organizations.

The leader of the conservatives, Pierre Poilievre, tooled his whole campaign around the 'fuck Trudeau' movement and was really hoping to campaign against him by misdirecting growing anger at complex issues like global inflation, provincial mismanagement, and international supply chain issues, at Trudeau. Unfortunately, Trudeau's an easy target due to having been a successful PM for 9 years and having made some unpopular yet necessary choices that prevented Canada from going into recession and created one of the best post-Covid economies in the world. Trudeau, realizing the danger of a Poilievre government, selflessly stepped aside, and now Poilievre can't compete with the frontrunner Mark Carney, a self-made educated outsider who has the expertise to correct the economy unlike Pierre.

When Chandra Arya started running, his campaign was a hot mess. No one took him seriously, and he was not likely to win. Conservatives saw this and started fraudulently signing up to vote for him in the leadership election. Liberals then disqualified him as a candidate partially due to this campaign by the Conservatives.

Now these same Conservatives are pushing the narrative that the Liberal party is racist against South Asians, or even 'Hinduphobic', when the truth is the Liberals simply don't want a candidate that can't speak both  and has suspicious ties. Not to mention, many experts agree 'Hinduphobia' doesn't really exist, and is just a term created by people who weaponize it for political purposes in India. 

**Only one party has continually fuelled racism against South Asians by spreading misinformation about the immigration system and pushing hateful rhetoric. Don't fall for their strategic concern about racism in politics now that it benefits them.**

Only one party has betrayed Canada by pushing Trumpian rhetoric and being aligned with the Republicans who've threatened to invade Canada.

Only one party had dinner with German Far-Right nationalists, handed out coffee and donuts to people waving swastikas and [chanting euphemisms for Nazi slogans.](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Content/Committee/441/CHPC/Brief/BR11747935/br-external/SarahAndChaimNeubergerHolocaustEducationCentre-e.pdf)

It’s a contrast to the stereotype that Germany has lost all sense of community, everything is impersonal and no one knows their neighbors. While that may be true in city centers, in less densed areas, your neighbors have your back, at least in some basic ways. It’s actually kind of rude not to pick up someone’s parcel, and I think that’s cool.

3. Hofläden

These are stands outside farms without any staff. The farmer leaves goods on display with a price list. Shoppers pick what they want, leave money in a locked box or cash box, and walk away.

It can be a simple wooden box with fresh eggs, milk, vegetables, or fruits, to larger setups with more variety. My favorite stand (people also call these Kaffee Boxen) sells homemade cakes and coffee.

This low key speaks to Germany’s relatively high-trust society, where people generally follow rules even when no one is watching and there is an expectation others will do the same.

This is a throwaway account. I (28M) have been married to my wife Lindsey (25F) for two years, we’ve been together for 7. Our marriage is great. Despite us both being busy with work, we still make time to go on dates and be intimate with each other whenever we can. I work in engineering and Lindsey is an RN, so I pay for most of the bills and utilities. We “split the bills” but I pay for majority of the costs because I make more. Lindsey usually fully covers grocery costs and the wifi which isn’t much because it’s just the two of us. I feel that since I make and spend more money, Lindsey should make up for that in housework. I’m not some traditional wife desiring asshole, I think it’s great that she works and has goals for her career, I want her to. I feel like our chores are split fairly. It changes day by day depending on our schedules, but typically, Lindsey cooks our meals (she is much better than me, trust me, you don’t want me anywhere near a kitchen) but it’s nothing fancy or requiring a lot of effort. She does the dishes and vacuums but it’s not daily. It’s more like an “as needed” basis. I take out the trash weekly and wash our cars about once a month. This has always seemed fair to me, but recently I’ve felt frustrated with her. I’ve been at my current job for 6 years and I’ve developed really great friendships in my time here. There’s a few of us that always get together on break for lunch and whatnot. One of my coworkers, “John” (35M) has been married to his wife “Claire” for about 10 years if my memory serves correctly. About a month ago John invited me and the rest of the gang + our wives to have dinner at their house. Claire is a stay at home mom so she handles everything at home while John works and brings home the bacon. I know this sounds bad, but I was jealous. Not because she’s a stay at home mom, I don’t want kids, but because John has a wife that actually puts effort into her food and cleaning. Their house was IMMACULATE, completely spotless, no dishes left in the sink, little knick knacks left out on countertops, nothing! I couldn’t believe it. Claire set the table and waited on everyone. She was thoughtful and made sure everyone’s glasses were always full and would ask if she could get us more food, etc. She made filet mignon with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables on the side. It was amazing and I can’t remember the last time Lindsey put any effort into our meals. It’s always something lazy like pasta, a lot of chicken centered meals, tacos, quesadillas, everything requiring little to no effort. On the drive home, Lindsey made a comment about how Claire is an amazing cook and said she would like to have dinner with them again because they’re great people. I agreed with her and said something along the lines of “you could also be more adventurous with your meal choices so we can eat good at home too.” She took offense to this and said she didn’t realize her food was so bad. I said it wasn’t, but it’s nothing compared to Claire’s because she puts no effort into it. She stopped talking to me and was pouting like a child. She went to bed without speaking to me that night. I ended up apologizing the next day when she got home and she forgave me. Fast forward a week later and I became more and more frustrated. She was working 12 hour shifts more than usual and as a result, her house work suffered. She would leave at 7am and come home at 7pm, and on some nights she went straight to bed without making dinner. I ended up getting takeout on those nights. Dishes were piling up in the sink, the carpets were becoming noticeably dirty, and she just sat in bed scrolling on her phone or sleeping. I tried to be understanding at first but at this point she’s used to working 12 hour shifts so there really is no excuse. I ended up having a talk with her and was brutally honest. I told her that I’m not satisfied with her level of house work anymore and I want her to do more. I want her to come home and make dinner and I want her to put more effort into it. I gave her some examples of meals I would like to eat and suggestions for ways that she can clean before going to bed, such as drinking coffee or energy drinks on the way home. I thought she was receptive to my ideas at first but then I realized she looked pissed. She very coldly asked me if I feel this way because of John’s wife and I answered honestly and said yes. I told her I would be embarrassed if my friends came over to have dinner with us after that dinner at John’s. She started tearing up when I said this and I felt kind of bad for being so harsh. She didn’t say a word to me and just left the room. I came out a short while later and saw her maniacally scrubbing a stain out of the carpet on her hands and knees still crying. I asked her what she was doing and she screamed “WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!” The stain she was scrubbing was pretty much gone but she continued for what felt like hours. I started feeling sorry for pushing her to that point but then I remembered something …. something that could work out great for me or go horribly wrong. When she was in high school, she was baker acted (I will not disclose details out of respect) and was in a psych ward. She told me she used to neglect herself when she felt really depressed but after being in the ward, she obsessively cleans when she feels depressed or overwhelmed because of the habits they drilled into her. I almost felt like a DC villain because of the huge smirk that crept on my face. So, the next night she got home at 7pm. I told her I had something to confess to her and she looked petrified. I told her I was sorry, but I watched porn while she was at work because I was lonely. She ended up throwing up from crying so much but just as I thought, she started cleaning. She washed all the dishes BY HAND instead of using the dishwasher. She dusted everything, every fan, every TV screen, every shelf. I didn’t want it to be too obvious so I started limiting this trick to 4x a week max. Skip to present day, I made a joke at lunch with my coworkers about how I trained by wife to love cleaning. Everyone was laughing and asked for the secret, so I said “all I have to do is make her cry and she can’t wait to clean!” “Daniel” asked me what I mean, and I told him about how her response to being upset is to clean so I’ve been upsetting her on purpose. Everyone was silent while I was still laughing. “Adam” asked why in a very unamused tone. I spilled the beans about how Claire made me realize how lazy my wife is and I wish Lindsey was more like her. The rest of lunch was pretty awkward and I felt like I made everyone uncomfortable. I ended up texting John to ask if I did something wrong because he didn’t come by my station before leaving like he usually does. He told me he felt really weird about the way I was treating my wife and idealizing his. He told me I was being an asshole and “emotionally abusing her” when I should just communicate. I argued against this because I DID communicate. I told her exactly what I wanted from her and all she did was make excuses about being tired from work and needing sleep. She even suggested that I should clean more if the state of the house bothers me so much and that I should learn how to cook before criticizing her. We wouldn’t be able to afford the house we live in if it weren’t for me. The lifestyle we live is because of ME so why can’t she just show appreciation by cleaning and cooking better meals??? It’s been three days now and I am now sitting alone at lunch. When I sit with my usual group everyone stops talking. I feel like I really fucked up and want to make things right with my friends, but at the same time I feel like what I’m doing is okay because it’s not for no reason.

The ratio to coffee and creamer differs depending on the creamer. Also, and this is my opinion, the type and brand of coffee can change your opinion on a creamer. I can almost guarantee that if you bought a thing of cold coffee and it was sweet, say Starbucks Vanilla and mixed it in with this creamer or even the STōK Cold Brew slightly sweet or just a little bit sweet coffee, that this creamer would be extremely off putting.
Just because it would be way too sweet. I personally think depending on how sweet the coffee is, depends on the type of brew. To be on safe side, always buy coffee that is straight black , no sweetness, and you will be fine. 

Keep in mind the ratio. I fill this mason jar to the top line and then pour creamer the rest. In regards to the sweetness of the coffee, you could probably have a semi sweet brew if you go with a Califia Farms creamer just because while I love those creamers, those don’t really depend as much on artificial ingredients. Keep in mind though that sometimes the confectionary (fake) taste we get in some items is what makes them good. One of the reasons, I think, why some people drink creamer straight. Yes, people do that. 

Also, keep this in mind someone once told me: if you always eat healthy and really watch what you put in your body and eat, when you do junk food and food items that are processed, your body doesn’t really like that and the opposite is true. If you always eat unhealthy junk food and you all of a sudden try to eat all these healthy ingredients, you can actually start to feel not well. Not gonna die or anything, but you can feel a little “sick”. Same with creamers, especially if you are used to really good wedding cake or homemade vanilla cake, I can see how someone thinks this wedding cake creamer is absolutely disgusting. I’ll be the first to say it doesn’t taste anywhere near a good vanilla or wedding cake for that matter, but it’s honestly one of my favorite creamers. But remember, because I use creamer when I drink coffee, I always get the straight dark roast black coffee, regardless brand. Make sure the coffee you mix it with is not sweet. 

Last note: Some creamers also work better with hot coffee. I try to stay away from hot coffee because now it tears up my stomach, but certain flavors that are made to be eaten hot I think tend to have a different flavor profile when mixed with a different temp of coffee.

Okay, Rant Over. Happy Thursday!

So I am just gonna say this….I do get why people dislike this creamer. If you have the incorrect coffee to creamer ratio, it does have a crazy after taste. I also think you will get a little weird after taste a minute or two after drinking it if you don’t eat or drink anything else. Me personally, no where near as bad enough to toss out the creamer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those embracing the tiny home lifestyle, creating a functional kitchen can be a delightful challenge. The key is to choose tiny home essentials that maximize both space and utility without sacrificing style or comfort. Here’s a detailed look at essential kitchen equipment that can elevate your cooking experience, ensuring efficiency and enjoyment.

### Compact Appliances

Investing in compact appliances is crucial for tiny homes. These devices are designed to fit seamlessly into smaller spaces while offering full functionality:

- **Mini refrigerator:** A mini fridge is perfect for storing perishables while keeping your limited space organized.
- **Induction cooktop:** An induction cooktop can replace a traditional stove, providing a sleek and space-efficient cooking surface.
- **Convection toaster oven:** This versatile cooker can bake, broil, and toast, making it a fantastic alternative to a full-sized oven.
- **Multi-cooker:** Devices like Instant Pots can pressure cook, slow cook, and sauté, offering multiple cooking methods in one gadget.

### Space-Saving Work Surfaces

In a tiny kitchen, every inch counts, so having work surfaces that can be easily adjusted or stored is essential:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
- **Foldable kitchen table:** A foldable table can provide extra prep space when needed and be tucked away when not in use.
- **Wall-mounted cutting board:** This option saves counter space and can double as a kitchen décor element.

### Smart Storage Solutions

Efficient storage will help you keep your tiny kitchen tidy and functional. Here are some ideas:

- **Magnetic spice rack:** Attach a magnetic strip to the wall for easy access to your spices, saving drawer space.
- **Under-shelf baskets:** Utilize vertical space by adding baskets underneath shelves for additional storage.
- **Stackable containers:** Choose stackable containers for pantry items to maximize cabinet space.

### Essential Cookware

The right cookware can simplify meal preparation. Opt for high-quality pieces that are versatile and functional:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
- **Non-stick skillet:** A good non-stick skillet allows you to cook various meals with ease and minimal cleanup.
- **Dutch oven:** This heavy pot can be used for everything from baking bread to slow-cooking stews.
- **Mixing bowls:** Nesting mixing bowls can save space while providing multiple sizes for different tasks.

### Utensils and Cutlery

Having the right utensils and cutlery can streamline your cooking process. Focus on quality over quantity:

- **Chef’s knife:** A well-balanced chef’s knife can handle a variety of chopping tasks.
- **Measuring cups and spoons:** These are vital for precise cooking and baking.
- **Multifunctional tools:** Consider utensils that serve multiple purposes, such as a spatula that also functions as a serving scoop.

### Eco-Friendly Considerations

As you curate your kitchen essentials, think about sustainability:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
- **Reusable storage bags:** Swap single-use plastic bags for reusable silicone or fabric alternatives.
- **Bamboo utensils:** Choose bamboo or wood utensils for an eco-friendly option that’s also aesthetically pleasing.

By carefully selecting your tiny home kitchen essentials, you can create a space that is both functional and inviting. Prioritizing compact appliances, smart storage, and versatile cookware will help you make the most of your limited space. Remember that living in a tiny home doesn’t mean sacrificing quality; it’s about being thoughtful with your choices and embracing a simpler lifestyle. Whether you're whipping up a gourmet meal or just enjoying a warm cup of coffee, your tiny kitchen can become a cozy haven where creativity flourishes.

Creative Storage Solutions to Optimize Your Tiny Home Kitchen
-------------------------------------------------------------

In a tiny home kitchen, space is often at a premium. Optimizing every square inch can make a massive difference in functionality and comfort. With some creative storage solutions, you can enhance your kitchen experience while making the most out of limited space. Here are innovative ideas to help you organize your tiny home kitchen effectively.

### Utilize Vertical Space

When floor space is limited, look upwards. Use the vertical dimension to your advantage by installing shelving and cabinets that reach the ceiling. This not only maximizes storage but also helps keep your kitchen organized.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
- **High Shelves:** Store rarely used items on high shelves. Use storage baskets or bins for easy access.
- **Wall-Mounted Racks:** Hang pots, pans, and utensils on wall-mounted racks, freeing up precious cabinet space.
- **Magnetic Strips:** Install magnetic strips for knives and spices, keeping them within reach while utilizing wall space.

### Multi-Functional Furniture

In a tiny home kitchen, every piece of furniture should serve multiple purposes. Invest in multi-functional furniture to increase your kitchen's efficiency.

- **Storage Ottomans:** Incorporate ottomans with storage capabilities for extra seating and a place to stash kitchen tools.
- **Drop-Leaf Tables:** Use a drop-leaf table that can expand when needed and collapse to save space when not in use.
- **Island with Storage:** If you have room, consider a kitchen island that doubles as a workspace and provides additional cabinets.

### Creative Cabinet Solutions

Cabinets don’t have to be conventional. Look for innovative solutions to maximize the storage within your kitchen cabinets.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
- **Pull-Out Shelves:** Install pull-out shelves for easier access to items in the back of your cabinets.
- **Lazy Susans:** Use lazy Susans in corner cabinets to store spices, oils, and canned goods efficiently.
- **Door Storage:** Attach organizers to the insides of cabinet doors for additional space to store small items like spices and cutting boards.

### Smart Use of Counter Space

The counter space in your tiny kitchen should not be cluttered. Utilize it wisely to maintain an organized appearance.

- **Spice Racks:** Set up a small spice rack on the counter to keep your favorite spices at hand.
- **Basket Storage:** Use decorative baskets to group similar items together, keeping the surface neat and tidy.
- **Portable Carts:** Consider a rolling cart for additional prep space that can be moved around as needed.

### Use Underutilized Spaces

There are often overlooked spaces in your kitchen that can be transformed into valuable storage areas. Finding these spots can provide just the extra room you need.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
- **Under the Sink:** Use shelving units or stackable containers to organize cleaning supplies and kitchen essentials.
- **Above the Fridge:** The top of the refrigerator can serve as a storage spot for items that you don’t need to access frequently.
- **Kickboards:** Consider installing shallow drawers in the kickboard area for flat storage of baking sheets and cutting boards.

### Incorporate Baskets and Bins

Baskets and bins are excellent for grouping items together. Their versatility means they can fit into any available space, making your kitchen look organized and stylish.

- **Open Shelving:** Use baskets on open shelves to create a visually appealing and functional storage option.
- **Under-Counter Bins:** Stash cooking appliances and utensils in bins tucked under counters to keep the countertop clutter-free.

By implementing these creative storage solutions, you can optimize your tiny home kitchen and make it more functional. The key is to think outside the box, utilizing every inch of space to create an organized, inviting area for cooking and gathering. With limited square footage, the possibilities are endless when you embrace innovation and creativity.

### Conclusion

Creating a functional and inviting kitchen in a tiny home may seem challenging, but with the right essentials and smart storage solutions, you can maximize both space and functionality. Selecting the right kitchen equipment is crucial, as it allows you to perform daily cooking tasks efficiently while making the most of your limited space. Compact appliances like multi-functional cookers and stackable utensils are game-changers, simplifying meal prep without overwhelming your kitchen.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/tiny-home-essentials-kitchen  
  
When it comes to storage, creativity is your best ally. Utilizing vertical space through wall shelves or hanging pots can free up valuable counter areas. Additionally, incorporating hidden compartments or pull-out drawers can help keep your kitchen organized while maintaining a clutter-free environment. Don't underestimate the impact of clear containers for easy visibility and access to your pantry items.

Ultimately, the essence of a well-designed tiny home kitchen lies in thoughtful planning and intentional choices. The selected equipment and storage solutions should reflect your cooking habits and lifestyle preferences. By carefully curating your kitchen space, you not only improve functionality but also create a warm and welcoming atmosphere. As you embark on this journey of optimizing your tiny home kitchen, remember that every inch counts. Embrace creativity and establish a space that fits your needs and brings joy to your culinary experiences. With these tiny home essentials and innovative storage strategies, you can enjoy a kitchen that feels both spacious and functional, making your tiny home living experience truly special.

Happy Thursday goblins! 

Today seems like a good day to make a short State of the Sub Post. 

We all know that the world, the fandom, our sub and related spaces are constantly moving and changing, and sometimes it’s nice to have some reminders about where we (the sub and your mods) stand. 

Now, we *really* shouldn’t have to say this. For almost a year and a half this has been the truth and that has not changed at all. Don’t insult us by thinking any different. Good Omens After Dark embraces *all*. 

*Eeeeeeeveryone.* All beliefs, all creeds, all genders, all sexualities, and all arrangements in our favorite ineffables and in the goblins who create and enjoy them. We each have our preferences of course (and yes we like to have some friendly slapfights maybe about some BAMF Azi or Top Crowley for example) but that’s the thing. *Friendly*. Everyone is welcome in on the joke, because we rarely take much seriously here. That’s what has always made this a fun, unhinged sort of place. 

But what we do take seriously is our strong “No Downvote” culture, which is what also makes this place so welcoming. This isn’t like other subreddits. You don’t like it, that’s okay, just scroll on by and find something you do like. Don’t downvote something just because you don’t like it, because someone else here *does*, and we do not yuck each other’s yums in GOAD. 

We work hard to keep the culture of this place going, and we don’t get paid for it. It’s a lot more work than you might think, especially because we all have lives on the outside, but we do it out of love for what everyone brings here: porn, but also the sense of community and creativity (with a heavy dash of ridiculousness and maybe some dumbassery.) 

Mah point is… ~~dolphins~~. No, wait. The point is, if you find yourself doubting that we have your back—don’t. Because of course we do. 

Xoxo,

~~Your Benevolent Dictators~~

~~Your Professional Shitbirds~~

I go in there every morning, and the weirdest thing is, every single one of these Christmas songs are either ones I have never heard in my life, or odd terrible cover versions of major Christmas oldies. Some I've tried to Shazam, and they have had like 45 ID's, so they must be very rare. Why are there so many Christmas songs like this which very often not properly released, are they all just taken off YouTube or Tiktok? 

There's one played every now and then with a really catchy tune and bells ringing all the way through it, with a posh-like classic male vocal and a background children's choir singing by the sound of things. It can't be Shazamed so it must be exceptionally obscure! There's lyrics all about Santa and presents etc, and then a really catchy chorus which goes:

#Ding, dong, Merry Christmas, ding, dong Jingle bells,
#Ding, dong, Merry Christmas, ding, dong, Jingle bells (with the 2nd ""jingle bells"" bit sung in a slightly lower key.)


It just gets stuck in your head but its like there's no such song in existence! LOL how do Costa Coffee find this music and why on Earth are they playing ""alien"" Christmas songs... in late JANUARY?

As someone who loves to experiment with coffee styles and flavors, this machine seemed like a dream come true. With its sleek black plastic finish and thoughtful design, it sits attractively on my counter. But does it truly deliver on its promises? Let me walk you through my experience with this versatile machine.

The design is hands down one of the most impressive features of the Ninja CFN601. It’s compact, given its multifunctionality, and offers intuitive touch controls. The adjustable cup tray is a lifesaver because I can switch between my tiny espresso cups and a hefty travel mug without any spills. The build feels sturdy, although it leans heavily on plastic components. I wouldn't call it premium, but it’s practical and lightweight. If you’re someone who appreciates aesthetics, it’s not going to be an eyesore in your kitchen.

Curious about Ninja CFN601 cost? [Check it out on Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/ninja-cfn601-review-espresso-coffee-maker-b0b9yp76fn/)

The brewing performance is where this machine shines. It offers three espresso styles—Espresso, Lungo, and Over Ice—along with three coffee brew styles: Classic, Rich, and Over Ice. I found the espresso brewing process surprisingly efficient thanks to its 19-bar pressure system. The crema on my espresso shots? Silky smooth and indulgent. However, I did notice that the machine is somewhat noisy during the espresso brewing. It’s not a dealbreaker, but if you’re brewing early in the morning, it might wake the household.

Coffee lovers who enjoy bold flavors will appreciate the Rich mode. It extracts a stronger and more aromatic cup compared to Classic mode. The Over Ice option is a fun addition, especially for iced coffee enthusiasts. However, brewing a full 12-cup carafe took longer than expected, and the warming plate didn’t keep the coffee hot for as long as I’d hoped.

Taste is subjective, but I found the coffee brewed through the Ninja CFN601 to be rich and well-balanced. Whether I used espresso capsules or my favorite ground coffee, the results were consistently good. My friends, who are self-proclaimed coffee snobs, gave a thumbs-up to the espresso quality. The frother, though manually operated, worked wonders with almond milk. I’ve made lattes and cappuccinos that rival my local café’s offerings. Surprisingly, even my kids had fun frothing milk for their hot chocolate, though cleanup afterward was a bit of a chore.

Speaking of cleaning, this is where the Ninja CFN601 loses a few points. While some components, like the removable water reservoir and used capsule bin, are easy to clean, the frother attachment requires more effort. If left uncleaned for a few days, it can become a sticky mess. That said, the dishwasher-safe parts are a blessing, and the machine’s built-in cleaning function helps to an extent.

**Pros**

* Versatile brewing options for espresso and drip coffee lovers.
* Produces excellent crema and bold coffee flavors.
* Compact design with adjustable cup tray for various mug sizes.
* Built-in frother for creamy lattes and cappuccinos.
* User-friendly interface with clear instructions.

**Cons**

* Can be noisy, especially during espresso brewing.
* Frother attachment is cumbersome to clean.
* Warming plate doesn’t keep coffee hot for long.
* Longer brew time for larger coffee quantities.

In comparison to competitors like the Keurig K-Café or the Breville Barista Express, the Ninja CFN601 stands out for its versatility. The Keurig focuses primarily on convenience and simplicity, but it lacks the depth of brewing styles the Ninja provides. Meanwhile, the Breville offers a more premium espresso experience but requires a steeper learning curve and a significantly higher price tag. The Ninja CFN601 strikes a balance between functionality and ease of use, making it an excellent middle-ground option.

From a cost perspective, the machine provides good value for money. While it’s not the cheapest coffee maker on the market, its ability to brew both high-quality espresso and drip coffee justifies the investment. If you’re someone who enjoys variety in your coffee routine, the Ninja CFN601 won’t disappoint. However, if you’re only interested in espresso, you might find better options at a similar price point.

This machine boasts several features that truly elevate the coffee-making experience. The delay brew function is a standout for busy mornings, and the large water tank means fewer refills. The used capsule storage bin is also a nice touch, accommodating up to 20 capsules before needing to be emptied. These little details show that Ninja has put thought into the design to enhance user convenience.

I’d waste entire evenings falling down rabbit holes of conflicting blog posts and outdated Reddit threads, only to end up with a jumble of half-baked ideas. Then I discovered AI tools—my secret weapon for cutting through the noise. But here’s the kicker: these tools are like overeager tour guides. They’ll point you to a “secret” waterfall… that’s been on TikTok for months. Here’s my no-BS method for blending AI speed with human savvy to craft trips that actually work.

# 1. Think Like a Local (Without the Jet Lag)

I kick things off by grilling AI with hyper-specific prompts. Last month, I asked: *“Find me a village in Portugal’s Alentejo region with under 2,000 residents, traditional azulejo tiles, and a family-run winery making natural wines.”* Boom—Monsaraz popped up, complete with its medieval walls and sunset views over olive groves.

*Quick hack: Add constraints like “no Michelin-starred restaurants” or “accessible by regional trains” to filter out generic suggestions.*

# 2. The Google Maps Gut Check

AI’s Achilles’ heel? It doesn’t know if that “cozy bookstore café” in Lisbon shuttered last month. Here’s my reality-check routine:

* Photo forensics: If all the Google images show winter scenes but you’re visiting in July? Red flag.
* Review deep dive: Sort by “newest” and look for phrases like “permanently closed” or “under new management.”
* Street View snooping: That “secluded beach” AI raved about? Might just be a rocky cove with zero shade.

*True story*: AI once hyped a “romantic Parisian patisserie”… that turned out to be a wholesale bakery. Cue me standing in an industrial park, clutching a sad croissant.

# 3. Hidden Gems 2.0

The magic happens when you layer AI ideas with local intel. Near Barcelona’s Sagrada Família, AI suggested Casa Amatller—but Google Maps revealed free entry nights. Even better? The “Nearby” tab led me to a vermouth bar where abuelos play dominoes.

Pro move: Cross-reference with Reddit threads using site-specific searches like:

site:reddit.com \[destination\] + “local favorite”

# 4. AI’s Strengths (and Quirks)

The Good:

* Spitballs combos you’d never consider (*wine tasting + truffle hunting in Umbria*)
* Digs up niche festivals/seasonal events
* Crunches logistics for multi-city routes

The Quirky:

* Sometimes recommends “hidden” spots that went viral in 2018
* Gets overly poetic (*“a symphony of flavors”* = decent tapas)
* Lacks BS detector for influencer traps

# 5. Prompts That Actually Work

Steal these tested starters:

* “Find a Kyoto ryokan under $150/night with private onsens and kaiseki meals”
* “3-day Mexico City itinerary focusing on 1970s muralist art and *tacos al pastor*”
* “Small Greek islands without cruise ports but with vintage fishing boat tours”

# Conclusion...

AI’s my trip-planning sous chef—great at chopping veggies, but I’m still running the stove. By pairing its speed with old-school sleuthing, I’ve uncovered everything from a Warsaw vodka museum in a former Soviet bunker to a Costa Rican coffee finca that teaches brewing through interpretive dance (yes, really).

Your turn: What’s your wildest travel puzzle? “Secret speakeasies in Singapore” or “dog-friendly castles in Scotland”? Let’s crack it together—AI optional.

I had a lengthy relationship with whom we met at the uni during our internship. I was 20 back then. I basically touched his hand at some point while we were out for a coffee and it took us 6 months to have sex (but after that we had sex like rabbits all the time). We broke up because I decided to go abroad for my medical residency. We still talk and love each other. He's a part of me.

Now, a guy in the hospital that I work has also catch my attention. In my eyes he's a bf material. It's not that I felt lust when I saw him. I felt that ""I like looking at his face"" and I'm interested on what he says and I want to meet him deeper.

We went out once for dinner and it was great. We text since then. He's in my age and he's also a resident like me. He was the one who asked me out. I asked him out today and went to the movies. We laughed a lot. I had a great time. When we said goodbye it was awkward. I thought of a handshake but I felt shy. I think he tried to hug but I failed to reciprocate. We just said ""bye"". I told him that it was a great time. He will leave out of town for the weekend and he said that he needed to have a good time tonight because he's stressed those days. He thanked me.

1idwwk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/this_is_us_discussion/comments/1idwwk7/season_1_episode_2_recap/,Season 1 Episode 2 Recap,"We are welcomed into Jack and Rebecca's kitchen, as Rebecca is getting the big three ready for school, making their lunches, and breakfast. When breakfast is ready, the kids are coming downstairs, and Kevin and Randall are fighting, with Kevin calling Randall, ""Webster,"" and Kate wants cereal and not melon. Jack comes down and sees the empty coffee pot, and Rebecca asks if she needs to show him where the coffee is. Then he does this cheer with the kids and goes to work. We then see the kids at school calling Randall ""Webster."" Later that day, he is venting to his best friend, Miguel, about his marital frustrations at the bar, so Miguel gives him some advice. He eventually came home with a gift for Rebecca, and the kids are in bed. Rebecca’s sitting on the couch and voices her frustration with Jack. She then demanded he quit drinking. She's not gonna have it. Kevin also realized that calling Randall ""Webster"" is pretty disrespectful, so he stopped, but his friends didn't. 

In the present day, we see Randall worrying about William, also known as his crack addict biological dad, according to Beth. He doesn't know how long William has left, so knowing Randall, he can't do that to William. Beth gets suspicious when William asks for money for the bus to go ""just around."" He also was teaching Tess and Annie about vices and brings up cocaine, while Randall and Beth are listening. They hear the word cocaine and it's time to get ready for school, and when the girls left the room, Randall and William made a joke about letting the girls try at 7. Then, we see Kevin getting ready for a huge meeting with his agent, Lanie, to discuss his next steps. Unfortunately, Kevin is contractually bound to the show for 2 more years. Then Lanie starts explaining that the network ""owns"" Kevin and that it will jeopardize his career if he leaves. So she insists that he shows up at her party that evening to beg for a second chance. He asked Kate to be his date, and she was hesitant at first because she had nothing to wear. She ended up taking her frustrations out on everyone in the support group, dealing some hard words with several members. Toby then jokes with her, saying she hulled out a bunch of fatties. She explains she doesn't want to go to the party, then Toby insisted on going. That night, Toby showed up at Kate's doorstep to go to this party. Eventually, they end up at the party, and Kate got drunk. Meanwhile, Kevin comes and speaks to the network president and asks if he can just go with god. The president tells Kevin that if Kevin leaves, he will be forced to Nagasaki Kevin's career

Once Kevin finishes that conversation, he finds Kate under the influence, unable to give advice, so Kevin dials Randall up and calls him. Eventually, after Kevin finishes venting to Randall, he asks, ""I wasn't a very good brother to you, was I?"" Randall told him he wasn't, but he still has time. Then they started talking about their childhood, and Kate chimed in. Afterwards, Kevin announced he was moving to New York. He eventually realized that Beth left the room, demanding answers from William because she is suspicious of why he uses the money for the bus. He doesn't use it for drugs, thankfully, but as Randall enters the room, he explains that the money is to get home to take care of the cat he has, Clooney. Annie has asthma, and William didn't want to make Clooney their responsibility. Beth eventually said ""Now I feel like a bitch""!

To finish this episode, we see that Jack slept in his work clothes, in the hallway outside their bedroom. He promised her that he was done drinking, and she opened her gift, which was a crescent moon necklace. She explains she is never taking it off, cut back to Randall's house in present day. Randall, Beth, William and the girls are in the room until a knock on the door is heard. The girls go answer the door, William goes to his room, and Randall follows after hearing ""Grandma and Grandpa are here!"" We see Rebecca with Miguel, instead of Jack. Rebecca has much shorter hair, and wears glasses now. She is still wearing that necklace, but where did Jack go? We will have to find out for sure.

1idwvmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/excatholic/comments/1idwvmz/vibing_at_the_coffee_shop_i_find_im_on_the/,"Vibing at the coffee shop, I find I’m on the highway to hell","Today was one of those rare times I‘m caught up and just relaxing on a day off. Ran some enjoyable errands, grabbed a coffee, and in walks a woman from my old parish. I hadn’t seen her in more than three years.

She is affluent, conservative, wears rare French and Spanish mantillas, prays a pearl rosary in Latin, admires sartorially splendid clerics such as Cardinal Burke, and is devoted to anti abortion activities. A deluxe rad trad.

I asked her how she was doing and inquired about her family. She barely answered before asking, “Did you come to your senses?” I knew what she meant without asking: Did I return to the fold? I said no, and I never would.

She said, “You know you’re going to hell without the sacraments.”

Work that charm on me.

I said as politely as possible that I didn’t believe in made up sacraments any longer, far less in hell.

She said it would have been better for me never to have known the truth because now I would definitely be lost.

Might have been nice if she didn’t sound so happy about my eventual immolation.

Years ago, I would have felt guilty. Today, I almost laughed out loud. Things can get easier.

Making threats of eternal hellfire is an odd response to someone leaving a group.

What about having a convo about why I left, how she might help, all that stuff about heaven rejoicing over the return of one lost lamb? Not that I want that! It’s just hard to imagine why someone would condemn you for leaving instead of trying to convince you it’s worth returning. 

Anyone have a jolly “headed for hell” story to share? Better able to laugh about it today than when it happened? 

TLDR: Just vibing at a coffee shop when a resplendent super trad tells me I’m on the highway to hell.

1idwvhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1idwvhn/tozo_e2_wireless_earbuds_t11152_detailed_review/,TOZO E2 Wireless Earbuds T11152 detailed review with pros and cons,"Testing the TOZO E2 Wireless Earbuds T11152 has been an experience that blends practicality with some solid tech features. I’ve worn these earbuds everywhere—from gym workouts to long work calls—and while they’re not perfect, they offer a lot for their price range. Let me break it down for you.

**Sound Quality**  
The TOZO E2 delivers a surprisingly deep sound for its size, courtesy of its 10mm audio drivers. Mids are smooth, highs are crisp, and the bass packs a punch without overwhelming everything else. I tested them with everything from bass-heavy EDM tracks to acoustic playlists, and they held up well. However, audiophiles might notice some detail missing in more intricate compositions. For casual and everyday music lovers, though, these are more than adequate.

[Check TOZO E2 Wireless Earbuds price on Amazon now.](https://wirelessemporium.com/product-reviews/tozo-t11152-wireless-earbuds-review-quality-sound-and-features/)

**Fit & Comfort**  
I have to say, the fit was one of the best parts of these earbuds. They come with three ear tip sizes (S/M/L), and once I found my perfect fit, they didn’t budge. Even during energetic runs or while doing yoga, they stayed put. Plus, they’re light enough that I almost forgot I was wearing them after a while. The only downside? After wearing them for extended periods, my ears did feel a bit of fatigue, but nothing unbearable.

**Battery Life & Charging**  
Battery life is where these earbuds shine. I managed about 8.5 hours on a single charge, and the charging case extends that to a whopping 30 hours. The case is compact enough to slip into a pocket, and the USB-C charging means it juices up quickly. Charging the case fully takes about 1.5 hours, which is fairly standard. It’s ideal for someone like me who forgets to charge devices until the last moment.

**Connectivity**  
Bluetooth 5.3 ensures swift and stable connections. Pairing them with my phone and laptop was a breeze. The range also impressed me; I left my phone in the kitchen and roamed around my apartment without losing the connection. That said, I did experience minor audio delays when watching YouTube videos, but switching to the low-latency mode made a huge difference.

**Noise Cancellation & Isolation**  
The earbuds feature Environmental Noise Cancellation (ENC), which works decently for calls. People on the other end could hear me clearly even when I was in coffee shops or busy streets. However, the passive isolation could be better—it doesn’t block out as much ambient noise as I’d hoped. Active noise cancellation isn’t part of the deal here, so if you’re looking for ANC, you might need to look at other options.

**Controls & Features**  
Touch controls on the TOZO E2 are responsive but require a bit of a learning curve. I accidentally paused my music a few times while adjusting them in my ear. The TOZO app is a cool addition, offering 32 customizable EQ settings. I spent way too much time tweaking the EQ and finally found a balance that worked for my listening style. If you’re a tinkerer like me, you’ll enjoy this feature.

**Water Resistance**  
The IPX rating isn’t specified, but they seem to handle sweat and light rain just fine. I’ve used them during sweaty gym sessions and even a quick drizzle, and they’re still going strong. However, I wouldn’t dunk them in water or attempt to use them in heavy rain.

**Durability**  
The earbuds and the case feel sturdy despite being lightweight. The materials—polycarbonate and ABS—don’t feel cheap. I’ve dropped the case once or twice (oops!), and it survived without a scratch. I trust these to last for a while under normal usage.

**Pros**

* Remarkable sound quality with punchy bass.
* Long battery life with a quick-charging case.
* Comfortable fit with multiple ear tip options.
* Reliable Bluetooth connectivity with low-latency mode.
* Customizable EQ settings through the TOZO app.

**Cons**

* Lacks active noise cancellation.
* Touch controls are sensitive and easy to misfire.
* Slight ear fatigue during extended use.
* Minor audio delay without low-latency mode.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to competitors like the JLab Go Air and Anker Soundcore Life P2, the TOZO E2 holds its own. The JLab Go Air offers a lower price point but lacks the customizable EQ and has a shorter battery life. Anker’s Soundcore Life P2 boasts better call quality and slightly better noise isolation but comes at a higher price. The TOZO E2 strikes a balance between affordability and features, making it an excellent middle-ground option.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
For the price, you’re getting a solid package. Sure, it doesn’t have premium features like ANC, but the sound quality, battery life, and app features make it worth every penny. It’s perfect for someone looking for budget-friendly earbuds that don’t compromise on essential features.

I wanted to share how I’ve gone about it thus, what I think helped, and how I’m feeling now. 

My symptoms started in October 2023, all though I had UTI/ bladder problems going back ten years ago that I very likely could have been the start of these issues but they went away for a while. In October, doctors told me they couldn’t find anything in my tests. Tested negative for every STI and UTI. It went away (coincidentally I was on doxycycline during this time because I had surgery). The first week of December it came back so bad. My main symptoms was painful urination, urgency, and just painful urethra all day everyday. I was having to leave work to go sit in a hot bath. I have a boyfriend that I had to stop being intimate with. My mental health completely spiraled out of control. Finally towards the end of December they sent off a new culture and said I had two different bacteria causing UTI’s. They prescribed me levofloxacin and something else (I’m blanking). When I finished after a week, my pain symptoms were only worse. They called me a few days after and told me my culture came back positive for ureaplasma and BV.

Right around the time I was waiting on my ureaplasma culture, I found an AMAZING uro/gynecologist (I’m in the southeast if anyone wants her name), who took me very seriously. She told me one week of doxy is NOT enough for ureaplasma and said my bf should be taking it too (unlike my OB). She gave me 14 full days of doxy and She also prescribed me uribel (methenamine and methylene blue) for pain and to see if it helped clear out any additional bacteria. During this time, I took everyone’s suggestions from this Reddit group. My uro/gyno recommended Theralogix cranmax, which is cranberry and d-mannose (UQORA DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH D-MANNOSE TO HELP YOU!!!). I also took 1000 mg of NAC by Thorne brand every day. I am taking seed brand probiotics and plan to do their vaginal probiotic reset tomorrow as today is my last day of antibiotics. I also have done three acupuncture sessions and have been taking Ba Zheng San (traditional Chinese medicine her for Uti- can only take for two weeks). I also have been taking garlic supplements. I also started pelvic floor PT today to regain my brain to bladder connection. I cut coffee, sugar free soft drinks, tee, alcohol. 

YES, all of this was expensive and will continue to be expensive as I will continue to take these supplements and continue my pelvic floor PT. I will not test again for 6 weeks and my symptoms very well may come back, BUT I finished my antibiotics today and I feel great! There are some slight urgency feelings and I feel like my brain and my bladder need to really reconnect, but I have no pain. I think pelvic floor pt will help. I write all this to tell yall that it CAN get better. The first 9 days of my antibiotics I hurt worse than ever before!! Make your health a priority. You can do this! 

And regardless of your beliefs, I had a lot of people praying for me! Tell your friends and family what you’re going through. It’s miserable to do alone. ",2,1738269472.0,ureaplasmasupport,0,1.0,False

1idwtsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1idwtsj/my_testimony_as_a_new_christian/,My Testimony as a New Christian,"I just wanted to write this testimony to express my love for Christianity (my faith this past year). And so that God is praised through expression of gratitude for his blessings. My testimony is not for the fainthearted as it is immeasurable pain that brought me to Christ. 

I was born in Saudi Arabia in 1994 or approximately 34 years into the Islamic revival movement known as Sahwa that lasted 57 years. Although Sahwa means ""Awakening"" the country plunged into darkness since hate preachers propogated a highly conservative Islamist interpretation of Islam. For 57 years, we lived in a theocratic nightmare where the morality police forced business owners to go to pray in the mosque during one of the five times. If you don't close your shop and go to pray, you were fined. At some point, people were infuriated when the morality police started setting up check points while asking people ""who is this woman next to you?"" to check whether a female was family or a girlfriend. My family was at the heart of advocates for Sahwa. Nevertheless, not only my family appeared super religious, but also they used religiousity to mask their evil actions. They excelled at evil. They murdered. They raped. They stole. They perjured themselves in court to protect the evil doers among them. They coveted. They broke almost every commandment at some point. I was supposed to turn out like that radical society and that radical family by proximity, but I believe the divine protected me for my good intentions.

In 2013, I came to Canada, and I decided to leave it all behind. I decided that since I am going to hell anyway because I would never have my mother's approval (that sentences you to time in hell in Islam). I stopped praying. Instead of worshiping God, I worshiped my desires. I studied my bachelor's and my master's. I worked. But there was something within me that cried for vengence. I was wronged deeply. And so my main purpose for living was ""become successful and show them they were wrong about wronging you"". Vindita is a fuel, but it's the type of fuel that destroys the engine bit by bit with every stroke.

It was like that until 2021. News of an uncle raping 4 nieces of his, including my older sister, made the world dark in my eyes. I tried reporting to the social services in Saudi Arabia, but after investigations that lasted months I was told that justice is not possible not only because of the statue of limitations of 6 months, but also because the victims won't testify regarding the crimes of my uncle. My mother protected her brother, and I was banished from the family for taking a stand. As a result, I lost contact with my little sister (the only family I cared about). I sank even deeper into my inner darkness. I became depressed and I lost my dream job. I left my birth faith at that point. Eventually, I decided to go back home to try to at least get my little sister and my niece out of that wretched family because it wasn't safe for them being around that many pedos.

In Saudi Arabia, I was put on a travel ban because my mother accused me of political agitation. I did try to ask my mother's half siblings for help with the sisters' situation, but they asked not to be involved in the whole charade. Eventually, I won the case and cleared my name, and the travel ban was lifted, but the upcoming months weren't going to be kind. 

In October 2023, I came back to Canada to do my PhD. However, I kept delaying starting the semester because I was not ok inside. I knew humans do evil, but mine showed an exceptional skill at doing evil. I was disappointed by the world. I was broken inside, and I didn't think I could repair my torn out soul. Atheism didn't help because the idea that the universe was random meant that what I suffered was the result of being absolutely unlucky.

Two months before January 2024, I began obsessing about the idea of rebirth. I just thought being renewed and reborn is the only way to make the bad past irrelevant to the present. I wasn't interested in spiritual answers, so I was looking in psychology literature.  On January 12 2024, I posted a question on a mental health reddit sub ""How to be reborn?"" (With my other account). The next day, I had a dream of a hooded man telling me to ""be reborn"". I was bewildered even more because ""how the hell do you do that?"". The next week, I went to the local mosque to attend the Friday mass, hoping I would find the answer there. I didn't. On Sunday, I went to the local church. There, I was fed pancakes, which made me stay for the rest of the sermon 🤣😂

At the end of the sermon, the pastor introduced me to a second pastor who was from Egypt and spoke Arabic. We had a great talk about the Christian story of existence and Jesus's philosophy of life. I was on my way out when the pastor offered to meet for a coffee in the evening. He asked me before we meet to read John. When I did, I came across the story of Nicodemus and Jesus talking about rebirth. For me, that was a sign from God to follow Christ.

The next day, I was reading Matthew, and I came across the Sermon on the Mount:

""Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. “Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way, they persecuted the prophets who were before you.""

I cried because it was almost like it spoke to me. And I fell in love with Christ when I read Matthew 18:6 about harming children.

My Christian faith gives me immense strength. I can't get enough of Christian life philosophy. I struggled with pain for so long. Wanted revenge. I didn't know that hate is poison for the soul and that forgiveness (letting go of desire for retribution) sets you free.

1idwsb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/usajobs/comments/1idwsb5/head_staffs_thoughts_on_the_current_situation/,Head Staffs Thoughts on the current situation,"I have been asked for my thoughts on the “ resignation” email and other developments.

First off, I am not an attorney. I am just an old HR person. I cannot give you specific advice. Do not DM or send chat messages about your situation. I will not respond.

1.      Things you should do- contact your Congresscritter and Senators- not while you are on duty and not using government equipment and express your displeasure with the current state of affairs. Phone is best, use your lunch break and step off government property with your personal phone. If you don’t know who your representatives are, shame on you. Google and figure it out. A google search should bring up how many Federal employees are in your state- remind your representatives of the economic benefits that Federal employment brings to their District. You might also say that you care about the Constitution, but if you are calling Republicans, they don’t care.

 2.  Start assembling your entire eOPF (or OPF if your agency has not gone fully electronic). Get your SF-50s and keep them some where else besides your work computer. If you don’t know how to do this and you have been a government employee for more a month, shame on you. Figure it out. Don’t forget your performance appraisals, because those help determine your standing in a RIF. Get a copy of your current PD (and other positions you have held if you can). Review your most recent SF-50- is it correct? If it is not, contact your HR office. Know whether or not you are on probation. Look at your appointment SF-50. Are you in the competitive or excepted service (see my tenure guide for more detail), Is all of your federal service accounted for in your eOPF?

3.   Are you in or out of a bargaining until- Block 37 on your SF-50 tells your bargaining unit status. If you are 8888, then you are ineligible to be in a union. Is this correct- are your in HR or a supervisor or manager or make policy determination or in intelligence? If not, contact HR. If you are 7777 you are eligible to be in a union, but not currently represented. Any other number means you are represented by a union. Figure out what that union is and how to contact them. You do not have to be a dues paying member to be represented by a Federal union. In addition. If you are not in a bargaining until, and individual action is proposed against you, you can ask a union official to be your personal representative. The Union does not have to agree and Management does not have to accept – but it is an option. If you are covered by a union- find your contract and read it.

4.  Unless you work for OPM, OPM does not have the authority to fire you. Unless you were appointed by President Trump, President Trump does not have the authority to fire you.

We hear that Reagan fired all the striking Traffic Controllers- but that’s not what happened- what happened (roughly) is the White House determined that there was an illegal strike and that the controllers were in violations of the law. Every controller was fired by the FAA (now maybe Reagan ordered the head of the FAA to do so), but Reagan didn’t fire anyone.  The head of the agency is the person who can fire you- in most cases this is delegated to lower levels in the chain of command. This is not the apprentice-don’t believe any unsigned email or text saying you no longer have a job. Unless you are a probationer, you have a right to advance notice with specific charges and a chance to respond. If you actually get a notice of proposed removal, then seek competent legal advice- not reddit.

Although probationers do not have these specific rights, you may have some rights (such as a shortened advance notice) in your union contract. But my reading of the CFR says there have to be specific reasons for removal-either reasons arising before appointment (suitability issues) or performance or conduct issues. I do not believe (and that and $5.50 will get a cup of coffee) that there is a legal rationale for all probationers to be terminated. Of course, I never though that Congress would refuse to impeach a President who led an armed insurrection, either.  A mass firing of probationers would be circumventing RIF regulations and I believe you would have grounds for an appeal on that basis. If are not a vet and have low seniority, you may walk out the door anyway, but in many cases, you will have priority placement rights in your agency or other agencies in the commuting area.

 4. Go to [Mspb.gov](http://Mspb.gov) and download the necessary appeal forms and figure out to what local office they should be sent if you are removed. If there are mass firings, the website will probably be overwhelmed.  Do this on your own computer and own time.

 Hang in there- remember your oath to protect the Constitution. Be kind to one another-

1idwr7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1idwr7v/my_former_best_friend_is_facing_criminal_charges/,My (former) Best Friend is Facing Criminal Charges,"Hi All,

I'm using a burner account because I'm very active on my normal account and some Redditors know me IRL. I hope that's okay here. TW: Domestic Violence ahead.

Long story short, my former best friend is facing criminal charges after police were called to his house during a domestic dispute with his wife. They have three kids together, he's been dealing with mental health issues for a few years, and I've known him for over 30 years. We were friends when we were kids and ended up living in different parts of the country in our late teens/early 20s, so I don't know his wife or kids very well, but have remained in steady contact with my friend right up until a few months ago.

He called me up in early summer last year saying he was in deep trouble, and proceeded to tell me that he accidentally knocked his wife down during an argument they were having. They had been having troubles for a while and had been arguing for days leading up to this incident. He said she started hitting him when he tried to take a cell phone out of her hand, and he was trying to get her to stop when he knocked her down and that's when police were called and he was arrested. He said it was a total accident, and now because of the charges and no-contact order he's living in some cheap hourly rate motel because that's all he could afford. He sounded remorseful, but in hindsight it seemed more remorseful for his situation than the one that he put his wife and kids into. 

His wife filed for divorce, and I haven't talked to her at all because I don't actually know her very well, and I don't know if me contacting her would accomplish anything at all.

I've known this guy for 30+ years and I wanted to take him at his word. I should've asked more questions, but I wired some cash so he could cover groceries and rent, and basically tried to support him while he faced this thing. I thought I could trust him and that the legal issues were stemming from a zero-tolerance approach that police take (which I wholeheartedly support), and that my friend was caught in that loop because of the knockdown.

Two months go by, and I learn during another phone call with him that it wasn't just an accidental knocking down, but that he actually knocked her out by kicking her in the head, twice, while she was down. He's a big dude, and has been training in martial arts for pretty much the entire time I've known him. He said he blacked out while it was happening and that he didn't realize what happened until he was about to do it a third time. I was livid and sad and didn't know what to say or do. We hung up, and he texted me a while later wanting to know how I felt.

So I told him I was furious that he had done that, that he could've killed his wife, that he changed the kids' lives forever, and after all that he led me to believe for months and several conversations about it that accidentally knocking his wife down was the worst that happened. 

He replied that all of this was stemming from his mental health struggles (which I already knew he had been struggling with for quite a while), but he seemed a lot more concerned about explaining away his actions due to CPTSD and a host of other issues than the impact he had on his wife and kids. And the kicking part he left out because he was embarrassed and added that his therapist says it's okay not to share details like that because his life isn't an open book for all to examine. I don't know, though. I don't think I would've sent him two thousand bucks for food and rent if I had known he'd knocked his wife out by kicking her in the head twice.

I got really angry and basically told him that I had been worried about him for a long time, but this was a whole other level of crap he got himself into again and I wasn't interested in being part of it because I have my own issues and my own life to worry about, and that his mental health struggles weren't his fault but they are 100% his responsibility to manage.

I think about my own wife and daughter and how I'd feel if somebody did that to them, and I don't think I would ever be able to see past those types of actions no matter how remorseful somebody seemed, what brought them on, or what kind of comeuppance they faced. There are some mistakes I'm willing to overlook within my friend group, but domestic violence is something that I cannot look past. I don't think I'd ever be able to go for coffee with him and not think about his actions. I certainly wouldn't be comfortable having him in my home with my wife and daughter present.

I ended the friendship and told him why. I talked with my wife and a couple close friends about the situation and told them I couldn't be friends with somebody who assaulted their wife and instantly created a broken home for their kids, and they said they felt the same way. I felt if I remained friends, I'd basically be saying I'm okay with domestic violence when nothing could be further from the truth. I don't know I'd ever be able to see past those actions even if they happened across the country from me.

I've been struggling with my decision, though. It's hard to describe. Part of me is still sad about the end of the friendship, but part of me really wants this guy to face heavy consequences. Part of me wants to forget the whole sorry mess. Part of me wants to put the guy on blast to warn others. Part of me feels I'm too judgmental or self-righteous even though I've made my share of mistakes myself. Part of me is questioning walking away from somebody who needs help, but I also don't feel bad about cutting ties with somebody that assaulted his wife while the kids were downstairs.

I saw a picture from last month on FB with him hanging out with some other lady, celebrating something. I don't know if they're friends, partners, or whatnot, but I wonder if she knows. If she cares. If she \*should\* know. If that thing the guy's therapist said about being an open book applies with new or prospective partners.

I'm venting, but I also wonder what thoughts you guys might have about this situation. Have you been in a similar situation? What did you do? Am I being a self-righteous blowhard?",4,1738269206.0,GuyCry,2,0.84,False

I wondered whether it was because tmy technique was wrong or if the coffee beans were just not my type.

To learn how to make pour-over coffee, I watched two videos on YouTube. The first one was about [the one-cup V60 technique](https://youtu.be/1oB1oDrDkHM?si=aiuCE5yGt0zb2kew). I realized I was doing it wrong after watching the video. I thought I had to wait for 30 seconds every time, but that was only after the first pour. After that, I had to pour hot water separately two or three times, but I only needed to wait 10 seconds between pours. Additionally, my water temperature was wrong.

The new growth on top happened when I brought it home but it’s been stagnant for two months now and I’m worried that the stems are dead?

I had a little plastic sleeve around it to try and make it more humid, but some mould developed. So I repotted and the roots looked good, nothing awful. Should I put another sleeve around it? There has been no new mould since it has been repotted.

The classic dangling carrot “it will be better after xyz ends” has been carrying me through the rough patches. I know however challenging it is for me, it’s much worse for him so I try to always examine my feelings before ever bringing them to his attention. I don’t want to be an extra obligation or a checkmark on the endless to do list he has to catch up on when he’s off. 

His schedule has improved since this year and weekends are more available. However, I don’t see a correlation between effort and having more time. I understand that things dwindle as years go by but simple things seem to fall by the wayside. No plans or initiative is taken. Even a simple “hey let’s go to this coffee shop this morning” on a day off would go a long way. We took a vacation earlier in the year and he wouldn’t even help me look at Airbnb’s when I was having a hard time choosing. 

I’ve talked to him about needing help to plan things since I can’t always gauge his energy levels or his capacity to socialize. He responded with let’s plan some stuff which hasn’t happened. When I ask about vacation dates, he responds by saying I haven’t thought that far ahead. It’s an endless cycle of saying let’s plan and then him not wanting to think that far ahead. 

I accept that I have to take the leftover of his time and energy but it’s hard when he also pours so much into one of his hobbies that requires a lot of focus and brain power. He will lose himself for hours in this. At the end of the day, I know all of this may be unique to him and not a typical med spouse/resident experience. Maybe I just need to vent but I’m completely lost on how to navigate this. 

I know he loves me but sometimes I just feel left with platitudes and no change. I can’t keep banging my head against the wall and repeating these conversations that lead to no where. Am I being unreasonable? Is it just survival mode and needing to escape? ",5,1738269136.0,MedSpouse,5,0.86,False

I’ve been fortunate enough to call Korea home for the past 5 years, and it’s truly starting to feel like my second home.

Funny enough, I just finished Coffee Prince (2007) last week, and I absolutely loved it. There’s something special about older shows—they’ve paved the way for modern Korean cinema and TV, and I feel like they carry a certain charm that’s hard to replicate today.

I’d love it if you could share your favorite dramas and the shows you consider to be pioneers of Korean cinema/television. I’m trying to catch up on the classics, and I’m sure there are so many gems I’ve yet to discover.

\- Current UTI (I'm on Macrobid) after unprotected sex with male partner during period (both freshly showered within 2 hours of sex) Did not use lube, no oral sex or fingering,  just PIV

\- While on my period I use tampons for the 3 days along with a pad/period panty. I change the tampon every 6 hours or less.

\- Trimmed pubic hair the week before only around the vulva with a clean and sanitized electric razor

\- Partner ejaculated inside me on last day of my period and remained inside about 60 seconds after

\- Ate more sugary foods than usual due to exacerbated stress

\- Drank at least 60 oz of water every day that week

\- Daily probiotic (Align, recommended by my doctor)

\- Drank about a cup of coffee with non dairy cream each day that week

\- After sex peed on a little dribble vs a more significant amount

\- Sometimes after pooping (of course wiping front to back and flushing and washing hands) I will shower and to get extra clean. Is it possible the water dribbling from anus to urethra opening can contaminate the area and contribute??

\- 2 months ago I had a tampon stuck in my vagina which I extracted myself. Not sure how long it was there until I became aware of it. I got a UTI during that time, went on two rounds of antibiotics and got my urine culture done and it came back clean/clear/unremarkable.

As someone who spends hours glued to a desk, whether for work or gaming, having a desk that adjusts to my needs felt like a game-changer. This desk has its ups and downs (pun intended), and while it isn’t perfect, I’d say it’s a solid contender in the adjustable desk market.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was the rustic brown finish, which gives it a vintage charm. While the alloy steel frame feels sturdy, I wouldn’t call it indestructible. I’ve placed dual monitors and a few peripherals on it, and it holds up well without wobbling. However, the desk surface comes in two pieces, which is slightly annoying. The seam in the middle can be a pain when my mouse glides over it. Using a large desk mat solved this issue for me. Aesthetically, it’s a win, but it’s clear they’ve cut some corners on materials to keep the price competitive.

Check FEZIBO B0DKFK46BX [price on Amazon here.](https://decorgurus.com/product-reviews/fezibo-electric-standing-desk-55x24-review-height-adjustable-insights/)

**Size & Space**  
Measuring 55x24 inches, the desk strikes a balance between compact and spacious. I squeezed it into my small home office, and it didn’t dominate the room. It’s big enough to hold my monitors, keyboard, and even a small plant because who doesn’t want a bit of greenery? However, if you’re working in a multi-monitor setup or need room for large equipment, you might feel cramped. It’s a desk that suits light to moderate setups better than heavy-duty workstations.

**Functionality & Features**  
The electric height adjustability is the star feature here, letting you switch from sitting to standing with the push of a button. The range of 28.3'' to 45'' worked well for both me and my 6’2” roommate. The memory height function is a lifesaver, especially when my wife borrows the desk and adjusts it to her preference. I programmed my sitting and standing heights, and toggling between them is seamless. The anti-collision feature is a nice touch, though I haven’t intentionally tested it (I like my walls intact). The motor is quiet, which I appreciate during late-night work sessions. However, some reviews highlighted motor issues, and I can see how that might be a problem over time.

Cable management options are decent but not groundbreaking. The hooks on the side are convenient for hanging headphones or a bag. I did add an under-desk cable tray to tidy up the mess of cords, as the desk doesn’t come with robust management solutions out of the box. A cup holder would’ve been a nice addition, but alas, my coffee mug still lives dangerously close to my keyboard.

**Assembly**  
Assembly wasn’t too bad. It took me about 40 minutes, and I was able to do it solo, though having a second person would’ve been helpful. The instructions were clear, but I noticed some users complained about poorly aligned pre-drilled holes. Luckily, I didn’t encounter that issue. The motor assembly, on the other hand, felt a bit finicky. If you’re not mechanically inclined, it might take extra patience.

**Pros**

* Smooth and quiet motorized height adjustment.
* Rustic brown finish adds a vintage aesthetic.
* Memory height settings are super convenient.
* Sturdy frame handles dual monitors well.
* Anti-collision feature enhances safety.

**Cons**

* Two-piece desk surface creates an annoying seam.
* Lack of a front cross brace makes the desk less rigid.
* Limited cable management options included.
* Some users reported motor alignment problems.
* Assembly might be tricky for those without experience.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to similar desks like the SHW Electric Height Adjustable Computer Desk, the FEZIBO B0DKFK46BX stands out with its memory height function and anti-collision technology, which the SHW lacks. However, the FEZIBO’s two-piece desktop feels less premium than the single-piece options offered by competitors like the Flexispot Standing Desk. The Flexispot also boasts a more robust frame, but it comes at a significantly higher price point. If you’re on a budget, FEZIBO offers a good balance of features and affordability, though it doesn’t feel as high-end.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
This desk falls into the affordable range for electric standing desks. While it doesn’t scream luxury, the features you get—like memory settings, a quiet motor, and decent build quality—make it worth the investment for those looking to dip their toes into the adjustable desk world. It’s not flawless, but for the price, it delivers solid performance. If you’re looking for premium materials or extra features like dual motors, you’ll need to spend significantly more.

However, she has refused treatment for it for most of her life. She doesn't like to acknowledge or talk about it, but she needs everyone to accommodate her way of doing everything. The biggest issues are her fear of contamination with food and memory hoarding (both physical and digital). 

With food, she has to pick every single restaurant or coffee spot after doing a lot of research. She cannot just choose something. Also, it has to be expensive, as she doesn't trust the cleanliness of anything not expensive. She can't cook at home, as she doesn't like to touch the food herself. As such, spending the weekend with her means spending $400 on food alone. If you try to ask to pick one place or eat somewhere else, she will refuse. If you insist on getting your own food, she will sulk, act disgusted, and not want you to touch anything she touches for the rest of the night.

The memory hoarding is also a huge issue. She needs to record and take notes on everything you say and do. She wants me to send her receipts, estimates for work done at my home, my weight, pictures of my medications, etc. She will grill me like the FBI about very private aspects of my life, as she keeps a file on me and everyone else she's close with. She also needs to take certain pictures for her records. She will even grab you and push/pull you where she wants you to stand/pose. If you are with her, you are not allowed to touch your own food until she tells you you can. She will take your plate from you in order to take pictures of your food and document it before it's eaten. She also wants you to wear specific clothing (often asking you to buy matching shirts etc.) for her pictures, and you spend a lot of your time with her taking tons and tons of pictures and videos with her, and helping her document everything said/done in her notes. She has to do a full diary-style write-up of every outing, trip, interaction.

If you even politely say no to something, or request something else, she either pouts (including up to full-on crying) or she gets really angry and passive-aggressive with you. Again, I understand it's the OCD, but she will also become enraged and really hurt if you say out loud that it's OCD. She just wants you to read her vibe and go along with all her preferences for everything. 

I've been friends with her for 20 years, but I've about had it. I started to just say no and do my own thing, and she started yanking me around and scolding me in public with her finger in my face. Is this worth saving?",2,1738268712.0,FriendshipAdvice,5,1.0,False

It had taken us a month to get to the first date, but we were both very interested and it went great. We had a few dates after and were texting/calling a lot, but because of her busy job as an attorney, there were a lot of times where she canceled on me. Because she would apologize and I’d believe her, I didn’t see a point in making a huge issue over it. It all came to a halt when one day (mid November) she cancelled 3 separate times (lunch due to work, happy hour due to work, dinner due to friend), she asked me to come over that night around 8:30pm but I was with my own friends at that point. She was annoyed that I didn’t tell her about my plans despite us not having planned to meet up that night. It caused a fight and we both floated ending things. We tried working through things but due to work and traveling around the holidays we were never able to meet and work things out, so things still felt negative. Ultimately a month later we had mutually decided to end things, although she would later flip on this. I held to my decision because I felt the frustration I was feeling was not worth it. I thought it great that she was so committed to her job, but it felt like the only time we could meet were late nights when we both have early work mornings. Many times I just wasn’t receiving adequate notice, and I had once found that she had to cancel when I had already arrived at the bar for our date.

Last week she reached out to ask for another chance. Talking to her has felt less stressful, but I still hold concerns that this relationship is what I want. We already met for coffee and she was distracted texting her mom in an emotional fight, and she had canceled dinner plans last minute yesterday and assumed it was just canceled (I texted her that morning to no response, and then at 6:30 pm is when I reached out and she canceled, so I understand I could be more proactive). 

I do ultimately want a relationship, but idk if I’m giving this girl a fair shot. I can’t say I’m feeling the excitement this time around, but I know that she does want to try here. She tries to call me often now but I don’t see the translation to in person. Am I letting my doubts take over my judgement? I don’t blame her for every cancellation, but should that justify the frustration I feel? Is it worse that I’m giving her a chance despite my skepticism? I do care for her and don’t want to hurt her, but I’m unsure what is the right move here.

30F with some pretty bad health anxiety! I am doing the Ducolax/Miralax prep ending at 9:30 PM tonight with no liquids after midnight with my appt at 9 AM!

  
I have had some pretty terrible health anxiety the last 7 months, and this sub has SAVED my sanity. I have had rectal bleeding very occassionally and only on TP for YEARS now, 2 years ago I brought it up to my OBGYN and she said ""no worries its probably hemmoriods"" without checking or looking... fast forward to last year in July I mentioned it to my mom and she FREAKED out since my grandfather had stage 1 CC and her friend (also in 60s LOL) just got it and only had bleeding... She got me freaking out and google and reddit made it 10000x worse. I get in with a GI specialist who makes it 2000x worse (he had HORRIBLE bedside manner and was using fear tactics even AFTER I agreed to a colonoscopy) then at the end was like ""well since I already see numerous hemmoriods its likely that but I cant say you dont have CC without one"" Like not helpful dude. In July it was going to be $4K and they do not offer payment plans, I said I would have better insurance can I wait until Jan and he said yeah no problem so here we are... upped my fiber and have had no bleeding for 7 months and zero constipation but my brain still is hooked on the .2% (shout out to me being good at stats and calculating my individual risk with fam history) of having CC.

  
Anyways, I am finally starting prep and the posts of people posting their tips and journey REALLY helped me especially updating with positive results so I think this will help my anxiety! 

  
Thursday (yesterday): I did low residue and Pho (with no veggies very basic) for lunch, and eggdrop soup for dinner. I dont eat breakfast (no reason I am never hungry in the mornings since like middle school) 

  
Today:

7:30 AM: Woke up VERY anxious and drank a cup of black coffee and called my mom to ease my fears a bit and worked for a half day. Also had 2 frost gatorades to stay hydrated.

12 PM: I had been saving food scraps to make a really yummy Chicken/bone broth for today, I had roasted garlic and onion peels and some onion scraps from last week all frozen and the carcass from Viva Chicken from early this week and it was DELICIOUS- been sipping on this for the last 3 hours (4 cups total) in a coffee mug and just refil right from the pot- so as the day goes on it gets more flavorful. 

2 PM: 2 drammamine anti nausea pills (my anxiety makes me nauseous and I am scared of throwing up!

3 PM: 4 pills of ducolax and 2 gas-X with an 8 oz glass of water! Also sipping on another big cup of broth! Getting a bit more ""real"" and trying to stay positive! ",2,1738268394.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False

We have fixed desks for each of us. A lady aged somewhere between 60-70 also comes in and sits on the desk behind me. During a casual conversation with the manager of the place today I came to know about disturbing things she said to him. I assumed the woman had left and I decided to eat my noodles in my desk as I was expecting a work email. After I was done I went to get a cup of coffee when the manager (27) struck up a conversation with me and shared that the woman told him I was the same age as her daughter and if her daughter was the one eating, she would’ve slapped her. Hearing this shocked me. This woman always smiled at me and pretended to be sweet and I wish she'd had the courtesy of telling me instead. I would have apologised even though there's no rule against eating in the desk, I just understand the smell could've been strong. It did not stop with this, among other things she had supposedly told him that my mom and I nasty the restroom and don't dispose the sanitary napkins properly. This shook me up as it was a blatant lie! My mum has gone through menopause for God's sake!! I asked the manager how could she be so sure it was us when there are 60 other women using the restroom and that this was clearly a targeted attack. He said he wasn't sharing this in the capacity of the manager but as a friend and he told me that other people are wary of the women despite being friendly to her in person. He warned me to maintain a distance from her so not to get sucked into any other trouble.
I told him that it is embarrassing she'd lie about something like this and also shared my experience of how the woman had insulted the manager’s colleague(25f)  by calling her an idiot when there wasn’t much the colleague could’ve done in the pertinent situation. To this, the manager said she does a lot of reverse psychology stuff and badmouths one person to another. This woman is a dentist but is engaged in giving therapy deeply rooted in pseudoscience. She takes calls on speaker for 45-60 mins at a time and none of us have made it a big deal. I am shocked at such behavior and don’t believe it will stop at this. A few pointers— 1. The woman had tried asking my mom to join her and her friends for lunch but somehow my mom could never get around to that. (I believe that May have hurt her ego a bit)  2. My friends from the coworking space think she is a jealous old woman and that she might be showing her frustrations from home over here. 3. A lot of people here call her ma’am and treat her like she’s a queen, my bf and I , we mind our business and try to keep to ourselves except with a few friends. 4. After this happened, my bf wanted to ask her politely but directly if she has a problem with us that he can solve. I asked him not to get involved because she could always twist things and make it about his gender and pretend she is being harassed in their conversation by him.

Should I bring this to the attention of the Management? I feel like this isn’t going to end any time soon and it’s better if I have some correspondence of these events in case she doesn’t stop troubling me. ",1,1738267903.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
