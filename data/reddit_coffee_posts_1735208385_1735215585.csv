Talbak is locally produced coffee from Bulacan. My first taste of this coffee is from Kape ni Pepe which is a road side pop up store and only sells coffee during weekend mornings near Philippine Arena and Bocaue Food Park.

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

If you had itching before dx, what was it like?","So, I'm a woman in my lower 30s and have had slight suspicions that I could be diabetic, prediabetic, something. I've had a few relatives who have or had diabetes (a grandfather, a cousin, I think maybe another 1 or 2). Most of my life I've been at least slightly overweight, and never had a super healthy diet but had an ok one. The past 5 years or so though, I have just truly let my diet go to shit due to mental health issues. I also drink 1-2, occasionally 3, sodas in a day, sometimes sweetened coffee too. Also an increased alcohol intake the past few years, where I didn't used to drink almost at all.

Frankly, being out of shape and depressed it's hard to notice whether I have energy changes much or feel unwell - low energy and not feeling great are kind of my norm because of mental health, so I think sometimes I wouldn't notice a change, if that makes sense? So it's hard to tell if I have symptoms like that.

But I have various unexplained itching, probably the past year or 2. A while back I'd notice I'd have a couple of drinks, and notice my heels would start itching. It was just like this weird deep itching that I'd notice a bit. Not every single time I drank, but sometimes. Now, probably the past couple of months (maybe at times before that), I've had random itching here and there. Sometimes my legs just itch a bit in random spots, or my inner thighs, or underarms or arms, or random itches anywhere all over my body. 

It's weird because it's like an itch that doesn't feel intense, but at the same time is hard to ignore. I'll scratch one, then another, and just realize they don't quite seem like the random itches that anyone gets at random times. Also doesn't seem to be explained by dry skin. It's like one small spot itches, then another, and another. Sometimes it seems to be a slight stingy feeling to the itch (maybe a nerve thing?...)

I'm agoraphobic and haven't gone to the doctor in a few years. Not really sure if I even care to go now.

But I'm curious to hear from anyone who was undiagnosed (with type 2) and had itching as a symptom. What kind of an itch was it, and did there seem to be any certain area(s)?",2,1735214950.0,diabetes,0,1.0,False

My cofounder and I are flying in from the EU this February to immerse ourselves in the city’s founder culture.

But with only one month, we’re a bit overwhelmed on how to make the most of our time.

**Any recommendations?**

* **Events or meetups** in crypto, startups, or tech.
* **Coworking spaces** (especially those with a focus on crypto or Web3).
* **Communities** or clubs that welcome visiting founders.
* **Networking opportunities**—we’d love to build meaningful connections.

We don’t have a super rigid schedule yet, so any guidance—places to hang out, favorite coffee shops near coworking spots, or even just cool local tips—would be really helpful.

And I'm getting tired of humanity.,"This is a bit of a peculiar and very long case, so I'll try to summarize as much as possible but it is hard to omit details of years and years. And please, forgive my grammar as english is not my first language.

I have chosen to go no contact with my two siblings for different reasons.

My oldest sister seriously disrespected and yelled at me on two occasions, made me cry and was alienating people close to me so they would stop talking to me or that they start thinking badly of me out of jealousy and despite (she is really toxic). She changed the story of what happened, making herself the victim, so I chose to cut all sorts of contact almost 3 years ago. Best.decision.ever.
This is, of course, after several years of me trying to just ignore certain red flags until I couldn't.

Now I'm in no contact with my brother for a year because he has been a freeloader and an ungrateful bastard to my parents and was talking badly of them to people he barely knew for 6 months in front of me (I can't imagine what he would say behind my back). To put it in context; my stepfather has Alzheimer and is incapacitated in a bed due to the worsening of the disease. My brother along with his husband moved to my parents' house to have a better life in our country because they used to live abroad and that country is doing bad economically. Since my mother has the ""burden"" of having my stepfather being dependent, they were not willing to help my mother change diapers or move my stepfather if my mother needed help changing and cleaning him (my mother has multiple illnesses as a result of an accident and has a work disability because of it, among all things she has osteoarthritis which makes it very difficult for her to move her joints) then they chose to ignore her and give 0 help and only complained about the situation and saying things as my mother was ""too much"" with these ""new friends"" they met in the neighborhood, stopped helping economically so they were living for free. I was paying mostly for all the groceries while I was there for the holidays. And they even chose to spend that last year's New Year's eve with them instead of with us. So one day I spoke to my mother about the situation so she is aware of the kind of people that live with her ( brother has been living without us for +20 years so he is kind of a stranger at this point) and I chose to cut off the relationship with both of them because I don't want freeloaders and fake people in my life. 

I have been visiting my parents for Christmas for three consecutive years (I live abroad), especially because I am worried about my stepfather's health.  However, because of what happened with my brother and his husband, I opted not to go this year (my brother is still living there), save money, and stay home with my boyfriend. I invited my in-laws to our flat. Why did we do that? I'm stil wondering...

Anyway, this is when my dearest MIL comes. I never told her about my situation with my sister or what happened. I just tried to ignore her (my sis) and move on with my life cos I thought my IL shouldn't care or know that cos they are not that close anyway. But what I did was, in fact, tell them about my brother and his husband and how mean and heartless their attitude were (my brother told me one day that he didn't care if my stepfather died which made me really upset and was very eye-opening) because they met them when my brother and his husband visited me and my boyfriend (we live in another country) for a month before them moving in with our mother. Their excuse was to visit me, but what they really wanted was to travel and stay for free. That's all...

The thing is, my MIL is a woman with a lot of issues herself. Very insecure, she has no friends, is very controlling and manipulative and always has to have right and for some reason hates to hear ""no"" and/or about boundaries... 

She thought, when she met me, that we were going to be best friends and was calling me nonstop at the beginning of my relationship with her son. She used to call to suggest things like grabbing lunch or going shopping ( I hate going shopping or window shopping with passion), to go visit them and have dinner or coffee, etc. But even my boyfriend had to set boundaries after a few years of what felt like harassment. Calling him nonstop for nonsense, trying to find any excuse to talk to him and ask about our plans, what we were doing, eating, etc. When we were to become intimate, there she was, calling. It felt like a horror movie, no kidding, a true nightmare! And she even had the audacity to feel offended when we set boundaries. Like, come on, woman.

Then came the obsession again.  She asked me to apply for a job at her company because they were looking for people (she works in logistics for a well-known clothing brand), and I wasn't feeling it. If I wanted to work in logistics, I would have moved back to my country for a better quality of life.There's nothing wrong with that type of job dont get me wrong, but I had other plans when I moved to their country, and felt like she was imposing her opinion or decisions on me. I appreciated the offer, but declined. She tried a total of four different times, really pushing and ignoring my will and boundaries.

One day I was this super nice, wonderful daughter-in-law, only to become this opportunist seeking her son's money in her eyes (?). Because my boyfriend's ex spent six years with him with no job and no studies, she then started to think I was the same, all because I didn't want to accept her job proposal, didn't want to grab lunch every time she asked, or go shopping with her when I had other plans with my boyfriend.

Then she eventually started to get annoyed because I wasn't buying her ""goodwill"" and setting my own boundaries. Her son, luckily, saw how pushy her mom was(is) and also started to change and backing up. So all of this annoyed her till no end. 

It is when it started the shit talking behind my back with her two other daughters. How do I know this? Well, I'm not 100% sure this happened, but my sisters-in-law changed a lot afterward, so I figured. Plus, the few times I went to spend alone time with my MIL, she always, and I mean *always*,  was shit talking about her own daughters. Criticizing the youngest because she is living in a one-bedroom rented flat with her boyfriend, who works as a postman, and she finds this sad... Also, criticizing her unhappiness with her daughter's boyfriend because he is ""weird"" for not wanting to visit or spend time with them(oh wow what a surprise!). Then criticizing the oldest because she does not visit often. Also how annoying her two dogs are. Then, being jealous of her daughter's mother-in-law because they spend way too much time together (they used to live together for several years) instead of with her. *Insert Pikachu's surprised face* And that's the thing; if she is so eager to speak badly about her own daughters, I wonder what other bad things she says about me...

My MIL is a woman that had her own issues with her siblings and they don't talk with each other for more than 20 years due to problems with their parents' inheritance, her brother scammed them and her sister allied with him instead of her or thats her side of the story. Sooo because of this I stupidly thought that she would understand me. Oh boy, I was wrong... 

Last September, we decided to go to Italy with my boyfriend's family to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday. We planned ahead so everyone could save money and avoid excuses. Everyone agreed, until a few months before the trip when my sisters-in-law backed out, claiming lack of money.  So, in the end, it was just me, my boyfriend, and my in-laws. 

One night at dinner in Italy my boyfriend brought up the subject that he didn't think was right that if I didn't talk to my siblings, my in-laws would talk to them as if nothing happened. I was in shock because I didn't expect it (probably it was the wine talking) and I felt awkward during the rest of the dinner but glad that he said something. I went to the toilet and apparently my boyfriend told my MIL something like ""how would you feel if me or my sisters started to talk to our aunt and uncle?"" She replied ""awful, I would feel heartbroken and betrayed"". Then my boyfriend said:""then you have it, that's how my girlfriend feels about you guys talking to her siblings"". I was so proud of my boyfriend when he told me that and I was hoping they would understand me.

Then this past October my in-laws decided to visit my country for the 10th time (they kind of obsessed) and my MIL told me that she wants to visit my parents but they need my sister as translator cos otherwise it would be awkward. I said at the beginning it was fine for me but please that keep my name or me out of the conversation. But then the more I thought about it, the more annoyed I felt cos why, why they need to visit if they are not that close and feels weird anyway. Why don't they just use Google translator? Then again, I know I can't force someone to forbid talk to others, that would be selfish of me, isn't it? So I let it pass.

Fast-forward to Christmas eve. I called my mom to wish her Merry Christmas and just to catch up and my mom then told me that she had received a christmas postcard from my in-laws and I thought ""aww that's cute"" until she said ""-and your sister too""... I was like wtf(?) why?? I guess at the end they ended meeting back in October, I guess my sister also sent her a postcard or so. In any case, I felt uncomfortable. I felt really weird, like all of sudden they were all getting along and I am the bad bitch that wouldn't talk to her siblings?? Because that's how it feels to me. 

Then, my in-laws came to our flat to spend Christmas with us. Me and boyfriend spent three stressful days organizing, cleaning, cooking, getting out of our nerves, for only four, FOUR hours in total they spent with us... But I'm telling you, at the end it was a blessing. Because what they only did is drink alcohol (they're borderline alcoholics), eat and just be socially awkward. They don't engage in activities. I said to them we have Karaoke, we have different boardgames but nope, at the end we spend almost two hours just watching funny videos on YouTube (Yay!! so much fun!).

At one moment my MIL asked me to translate for her a message from my mother that was sent through WhatsApp. That was it, I knew right there that my MIL has been texting secretly with my sister cos she only uses sms and Messenger so it was really weird that now she uses Whatsapp and is writing to my mom there too. But I knew that was my sister or my brother's idea (to her to start using Whatsapp to exchange text) and I guess I caught my MIL lying to me about the trip to my country and never mentioned that they all met behind my back. Then I told her that I knew she sent postcards to my mom and then I said ""and I know to my sister too"". She all of a sudden was  nervous or surprised that I knew that, so she asked ""how do you know that?"". Very telling asking me that in return as she wasn't expecting me to know that information because I'm in no contact with my sister, right? Well, I said ""my mom told me"" so all of a sudden her mannerism felt off and she admitted kind of ""proud"" of herself with her chin up and said: ""yes, I sent it to you sister also"" which I just replied with a disappointed face ""ok, cool to know..."".

Then the whole night felt like they were two detectives in our flat. Both were looking at all the christmas decorations in detail. My MIL started to look and flip almost every ceramic and porcelain decoration we have to know the brand or if it was legit. Then looking into a cabinet where we ""hide"" our wines. 

After we ate dinner, she received a call and went to the kitchen to get it and talk. In this kitchen there's a door that leads to our second bedroom which was all messy inside cos we put all the ugliest stuff in there to just have a more clean apartment. And all my beauty products and makeup was in there cos I didn't want my MIL sneaking through my stuff in the bathroom as she had done before and has been obsessed to know which new perfume I wear so she can buy it too as she has done in the past. To add, she has been obsessed with my clothes, asking where and when I buy my clothes, she took a picture of my DrMartens and bought herself some boots too... She is really really weird.

Well, the call took like 6 minutes and I was feeling uneasy cos I felt she entered the bedroom and was looking into our stuff. Once she came back from talking over the phone, her body language was way too off. I asked if she was fine and she said yes but I don't know, I was not having it and when I went to the kitchen and saw the door was not completely closed I went to ask her if she had entered to the room in which she answered with a straight face ""no, I didn't"". I got pissed, I got pissed cos i knew and I was in disbelief of what they were doing.

My FIL was also controlling our balcony and went there just to check if it was smelling cigarettes and did the inhale air gesture to just smell. My boyfriend saw it too. He did this cos two years ago I was smoking quite a bit and the balcony was smelly and they hate smokers so yes, I'm a woman in my mid 30s and still have to hide the fact that I smoke occasionally if I'm under stress to not disrespect them (?). All because my boyfriend used to smoke too behind their back and it is scared of disappointing them... Damn, even the oldest sister smokes and they don't even know, neither her own boyfriend lol.

I don't know, I just couldn't sleep yesterday. I was feeling very uneasy with this situation. I'm a very private person and I don't let everyone go to our flat cos it is our sanctuary and the fact that they felt entitled to inspect it felt like a violation of our privacy. Plus the whole situation with my direct family and that my IL are not able to try to walk in my shoes for once as they have this mentality of ""they are nice and kind to us hence We don't care what they did to you"". 

I feel powerless and kind of tired of everyone. I just feel to isolate myself more and more to avoid get hurt. It is a shitty tactic but it kind of works. I don't really know what to do or say anymore... I want to go no contact with my IL and not see them to just not give them any of my time and nothing to talk about... I am very hopeless with my life in the way that I feel everyone is just walking over me, like I don't matter. That people can be assholes, narcissists and it is just fine. My brother's attitude was rewarded instead of being apprehended. My sister played the victim, and everyone believed her without question and my mom didn't even defend me at all, even though she was present in one of the moments my sister overstepped me. My brother then played the ""good son"" card and started to change, and it worked with my mother and everyone else, but I couldn't overlook his horrible badmouthing. My in-laws, the family I suppose I chose because of my boyfriend, are the most self-centered and controlling people I ever known.

I'm glad that we're a childless couple cos I couldn't imagine involving kids into this and having this type of crazy grandparents and toxic dinamics.

We're thinking of talking to MIL today to shut the situation but knowing how easy it is for her to lie and do what she pleases, I'm feeling that this is going to be another excuse for her to just play the victim, shit talk and keeps her ways. But one thing I am sure is that I had enough of all their bullshit. 

Guys, am I overreacting? Am I being too extremist??

Hello. I've recently started my fun with Gene Cafe and it seems that I have underroasted few batches. After I left them for few days to degass, they became considerably more pale. I made a coffee out of them and it is... Watery. I would like to try to save them. Does anyone have experience with double roasting? Does it make sense at all?

Please note, I am not asking for medical advice and my specialist is aware of my dieting habits. 

Context 

Ckd patient with impaired renal function for over 20 years. Have 1 kidney and egfr has been between 26-30 for over 10 years. 

Been doing omad for just over 13 months and have lost just short of 5 stone in weight. My blood pressure has normalised and my kidney egfr has been around 26 during the same period. 

I try to throw in a 48 hour fast every few weeks and it’s been working great. 

Last week I did my first ever 70 hour fast and felt fine but then I had a meal and bloods taken the day after the meal and my egfr had dropped from 26 to 21. Obviously alarm bells were ringing, even the hospital called late in the evening to speak to me about it. I have to admit that hydration during my 70 hour fast wasn’t good, but I didn’t feel thirsty.  I’m wondering whether anyone else with CKD has see similar egfr drops if dehydrated? My drinks for the 70 hours were mainly coffee and Diet Coke, again I think the choice of drink didn’t help matters either. Just looking for some reassurance whilst I wait for more blood results to come back after eating and hydrating properly for a week. 

Also wondering whether fasting is safe for me to continue. My kidney specialist knows about it and he didn’t mention it being a problem. I’ve never discussed extended fasting however.

Hi all,
I purchased a new Sage Barista Touch Impress and I encountered the following issues:
- I tried 4 types of freshly roasted beans and on 2 of them it seems that the grinder has problems with the grinding - it gets jamed and not grind, and sounds different. All the beans are medium roasted (5-6 out of 10 roast level)
- The internal burr was set to default setting - number 6. For all the beans I followed the machine instructions for dialing in each type, in order to obtain a decent espresso shot.
- I tried to clean the inside grinder, I vacuumed all the beans and ground coffee and I observed that the internal burr rotated to number 5 by itself. How could this happen? I never removed the wire to rotate the ring from the default number 6 setting.
- I have tried the coffee beans that are jamming the grinder in my old Phillips coffee machine and they grind fine, without any problems.
My questions are:
- does the grinding machine has defects? 
- Am I doing something wrong? 
- Is this a common issue?
- Do I need to return the machine?
Thank you for your support!",1,1735214317.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1hmmxy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/exIglesiaNiCristo/comments/1hmmxy0/proud_ako_na_hindi_nako_napipilitang_sumamba/,Proud ako na hindi nako napipilitang sumamba,"Isa ako sa naging member dito because of my bf. Sa totoo lang masiglang kalihim talaga ako before and yung bf ko is catholic. Nung mga first month namin ay lagi talaga namin pinag aawayan ang tungkol sa religion. Nag try din sya magpadoktrina pero di na tumuloy dahil di nya daw talaga kayang tanggapin ang isa sa doktrina ng INC which is hindi kinikilalang Diyos si Cristo kundi tao lamang. Nung una lagi kami nagkakasamaan ng loob pagdating sa usaping relihiyon pero thankful ako kasi di talaga sya tumigil na kumbinsihin ako kahit na madalas nauuwi lang sa pagtatalo ang usapan namin. Nag try ako maging open minded. Inintindi ko mabuti yung mga sinasabi nya at minsan pinagbibigyan ko sya at sumasama ako pag nagsisimba sya.
Ang isa sa nagustuhan ko kapag nagsisimba kami ay yung nakakapag share sila ng gospel without saying bad about other religions unlike INC na grabe kung magsabi ng kung ano ano lalo na sa catholic.
Isa din sa nagpamulat sakin talaga ay yung may pinabasa sya saking verse sa bible na nagsasabing Diyos talaga si Jesus. At dun nako nag umpisang magkaron ng questions about sa INC.
Sabi nila ay masama ang magdagdag at magbawas sa aral ng Panginoon pero bakit may mga doktrinang binago? Sa totoo lang yung iba sa mga evidence na nakita ko ay dito ko sa Reddit nabasa kaya napakalaking tulong talaga netong group na ito.
Napaisip na din ako na kung bakit nga ba tuwing pagsamba ay hindi nila nakakalimutan ipaalala ang about sa paghahandog? Napaka contradicting ng aral na magbigay ayon sa pasya ng puso pero ang gusto nila ay handog na laging sumusulong. At sa dinami rami ng pera ng iglesia, bakit pati ang mga kakulangan na gamit sa mga opisina at kapilya ay kapatid ang nagpo-provide at walang budget para dun? Pati kapag may namamatay ay ipinanghihingi pa ng abuloy sa mga kapatid at yung mismong iglesia ay walang ibinibigay na tulong. At sa pagtulong naman sa lingap, ang priority ay yung mga hindi kapatid para nga naman makahikayat sila at makahanap ng mga pwedeng pa doktrinahan. Meron din silang fitness gym, barber shop, coffee shop at the garden. So para saan yun ? Wala naman yun kinalaman sa religion pero nagpagawa sila gamit ang pera ng mga kapatid. Buti sana kung libre ang kapatid kapag sila ang gagamit e hindi naman.
Napakadami ko pang questions pero syempre hahaba lang ng hahaba yung kwento 🤣

At ayun na nga nag start nako magpa absent absent sa pagsamba, di na rin ako tumutupad. Pero ang hirap lang kasi buong family talaga namin sa father side ay INC. Umuwi ako ng probinsya kasama ang bf ko at kinausap ko si papa about sa mga iniisip ko at sa pasya ko na ayoko na nga sumamba. Buti na lang ay hindi masyadong OWE ang papa ko at sinabi nya na malaki nako at nasa tamang edad na para magpasya. Nonsense na nga naman kasi kung sasamba pa ako tapos di naman nako naniniwala sa mga itinuturo nila. Pero yung isa kong kapatid na masiglang kalihim, ang gusto nya mangyari ay makipag usap daw ako sa ministro para masagot lahat ng katanungan ko. Kaso para sakin ay nonsense na kumausap ng ministro dahil syempre sasabihin nila ang lahat para ma convince ka na tama talaga ang inc. Isa pa yung ate ko na sinabihan pa akong masusumpa ang buhay ko dahil sa pasya kong magpapatiwalag nako. Typical na close minded. Pero ayun nga, sinabihan ko sila na ipinapaalam ko lang sa kanila para aware sila at di na magulat na di na pala ako sumasamba. Gusto ko lang na alam nila kasi pamilya ko pa rin sila. Pero diko na ipinaalam sa mga pinsan, mga tita at tito ko lalo na sa grandparents ko na masyadong mga fanatics talaga. Sapat na yung naipaalam ko sa main family ko.

Yung half sister ko ay diko na pinatuloy sa doktrina nya pero ayaw na din naman nyang tumuloy talaga. Yung dalawa kong kapatid ay may doubts rin pala pero di lang makapagsalita dahil nga puro masisiglang MT ang family namin. Ayaw na nga sana sumamba nung isa pero kasama kasi nila sa bahay yung kapatid kong masiglang kalihim. Baka daw bungangaan lang sya. Siguro tsaka na sya makakaalis kapag nagwowork na sya para kaya nya na.

Pagbalik ko galing probinsya at di na talaga ako sumamba. Malaya nako pero dipa masyadong sure kasi dipa naman ako tiwalag. Haha

After ng mga realization ko, grabe yung naramdaman kong panghihinayang sa ginugol kong pagod, puyat, oras at pera sa kapilya. At isa sa talagang nagpapalungkot sakin ay aware ako na once na matiwalag ako, possible talagang diko na makasama pa yung mga matatagal ko ng kaibigan sa INC. Kasi alam nyo naman ang mindset nila. Ang iniisip ko na lang ay ganyan talaga ang buhay. Talagang may mga taong mawawala sa buhay mo kahit hindi mo gusto.

Sa ngayon ay sumasama sama ako sa pagsisimba ng bf ko pero honest naman ako sa kanya na hindi dahil hindi nako naniniwala sa INC, ay maniniwala nako sa catholic.

Nandito ako sa point na diko alam kung anong next step ko pagdating sa religion. Pero nagpe-pray pa rin naman ako. Diko na lang talaga alam kung dapat pa ba akong maniwala sa religion dahil sa naranasan ko sa INC na grabe ang brainwashing. Kasi kahit aware ako sa mga kasinungalingan sa inc, nandun pa rin yung nababagabag ako na baka mali lang ako at baka pagsubok lang ito sakin.

Dati ang iniisip ko, kaya ko nakilala ang bf ko ay para maakay ko sya. Pero baliktad pala. Kaya ko pala sya nakilala ay para maalis nako dito sa pekeng relihiyon na ito.",2,1735214312.0,exIglesiaNiCristo,3,1.0,False
1hmmxwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hmmxwc/aitah/,AITAH,"Sorry, the title didn't post correctly for some reason -  AITAH for thinking about going no contact with my mother?

I need to talk about this with someone or I think my head will explode. I created a new account since my other one has some real life friends connected to it. They know about some of this, but I don't want them to know all the details, nor hear about my morning breakdown.

I (F, 33) am considering going no contact with my mother (70). I've considered it before, but this morning I'm considering it again.

Some background: my mother and I are the only members of our family. She doesn't have any sibling or closer relatives, and I am an only child, except for a much younger half sister on my deceased father's side.

My parents split up when I was around 15 - he cheated with a woman who came into our life as a family friend and who befriended me. My father did some financial speculation for which my mother put up her dead father's house as collateral - they lost it all and made, from what I understand, more than one million euros in debt. They broke up, both became severely depressed. My father drank, womanized.

My mother was so angry. She would tell me my father deserved to die every time I went and visited him. I picked up quite a lot of unhealthy coping mechanisms myself - over-eating, drinking, >!self harm!<, all of which I am dealing with now and have for years. I checked myself into a psychiatric clinic for six months in my late teens, because I could not see my parents helping me. I was very lonely and learned to depend on myself early on. I moved out the first chance I got. I'm fiercely independent in most aspects of my life - too independent. I have a hard time forming relationships, opening myself up to others and allowing myself to be vulnerable, because I don't trust anyone to stick around when I become a ""burden.""

Fast forward fifteen+ years. My father died six years ago, leaving behind his new wife and very young daughter. My mother and I are close. Too close, if you ask me. I help her with things, tech stuff, her phone, trouble she has with friends, which is often, etc. She's quite avoidant when it comes to ""uncomfortable"" topics and often needs my help with things that could have easily been solved but now require more work. It's fine, it's who she is, she's only human. I'm happy to be helpful, for the most part.

A constant topic in my our relationship is my weight. I'm slightly overweight. I don't like to dress very ""feminine"". I take care of myself, but I'm a jeans and hoodie kinda person. It's just how I feel most comfortable. Someone pushing me on my weight or my style makes me deeply upset, ""triggers"" me, you could say. Yet my mother consistently does it, no matter how many times I've asked her to stop.

She wrote me a lengthy email this morning, asking me to lose weight, suggesting I go for walks during lunch breaks, do intermittent fasting - most of which I do. I'm not saying there's not room for improvement. I'm not saying I couldn't be healthier. She didn't bother me much with it for the last year, since I had lost some weight, which she took as a success on her end. Before that, it was a constant topic, brought up almost weekly, for all of my adult life.

This isn't the only thing she constantly ignores that I've asked her to do. When I invite her into my apartment, she moves things around, picks up things that are lying around, criticizes me when I haven't vacuumed in a couple of days. I'm not a messy or dirty person. I'm not a 60's housewife either. I've asked her to stop this. I've refused to invite her into my home if she continues criticizing me.  She says it's just normal mother behavior. I'm not a mother and have never been mothered by anyone else, so I have no idea whether it is.

Sometimes, a couple of times, she has called be crying, desperate about things in her personal life. When I started therapy again last year, I sometimes did not react to her calls or messages. For context: she texts and calls almost every day. She wants to see me three times a week, usually. It's too much for me, since our meetings are more often exhausting than not. I've told her that between work and my own private life it's too much, which led to one of her breakdowns where she told me ""she doesn't feel like I love her anymore"".

Once she called me while I was spending some weeks out of the country. I was genuinely worried she was going to hurt herself, considered traveling home. When I confronted her about her behavior a day later on the phone, she said ""don't make such a big deal about it"".

I spend Christmas Eve with her, with her alone. We both had a little bit of wine, and overall a nice evening. She got a little drunk. When she does that, she starts holding my hand, touching my face. I have some aversion to intimacy due to some issues with my father and other older men when I was a young girl. I don't like the way she touches me, and I don't know if I'm overreacting. She touches me like you would touch a lover, not a daughter. I pull my hand back or move my head so she knows not to touch me this way, but she often still does.  On the one hand she repeatedly criticizes my body, on the other she touches it when I clearly don't want her to. How does that make sense? How does she expect me to be okay with that?

I don't know if I'm overreacting. I don't mind hugs, but someone touching my hands or face often makes me uncomfortable, but then most people simply don't do it.

I don't know where I'm going with this. I'm sorry I'm rambling. I was sitting in bed this morning since I took a few days off work around the holidays. I was drinking coffee, reading, writing, enjoying my free time, which was when she sent me the aforementioned email. She said she did it this way since I ""appreciate the written word"". Now I'm sitting here, sobbing my eyes out, writing a fucking post on reddit. But I'm so tired.

I don't want to be on the defensive. I just want her to leave me alone. I don't want to be touched by her anymore. I don't want her to look at my body or my apartment or myself anymore and judge me. I've told her that my father has touched me in ways he shouldn't have (he didn't sexually abuse me, but he touched me the way you would touch a child when I was already a teenager - little pats on the butt, etc.  He also commented on my breasts and body many times as well as expose me to binge drinking and women he brought home and had sex with in the room next to the one I was sleeping in). My mother was surprised, but never brought up the topic again. I've come out to her as a lesbian, and she has never acknowledged it, since I don't have any partners I bring to meet her.

She does not mother me. I mother myself, however badly, but she reaps all the ""benefits"" of having me as her daughter - me taking care of her, etc.

I don't know what to do. I have the usual fears of cutting off contact and then I imagine her getting sick, being unwell, dying because I'm not around, stuff like that. I don't know that I actually have it in me to break off contact with her. I know I should go back to therapy, and I will, but I just need someone, today, to tell me if I am going crazy or if I am in the right, and my mother is acting wrongly.

My therapist, when I was going to therapy, said I needed to set clear boundaries to my mother and decrease contact. She suggested my mother might have borderline personality disorder. I still feel like I'm overreacting, like this is just normal stuff and I'm being a pig-headed asshole, like I shouldn't be so sensitive over her just wanting me to be healthy, losing some weight, seeing me. Maybe I just need to be above it, let her make her comments. She says I should. When I asked her recently, after being quite hurt by her comments on my body and apartment, how she expects me to reacts, she said: ""You should be above such things,"" as in, I shouldn't mind her comments. I don't understand that. Why is it my responsibility to be above her comments when she knows they hurt me?

I'm sorry for the rambling post, I hope it makes some sense. AITAH or am I justified in my wish to not see her anymore?",2,1735214305.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I had ghosted my LDR in the beginning of this year after telling him for months that I could not give him what he needed but he kept on insisting we try to make it work. After being tasked with a major project at work, I just couldn’t handle it. He knew that this was a coping mechanism I used but after not hearing from me for about a month, he broke up with me via text/voicemail. In the moment, I didn’t really give it a second thought because being the workaholic that I am, my career meant so much more. It took me about a month to listen to the full voicemail & process everything. 

During this time, I had also met a new guy coming back from my work trip. He had casually asked me to coffee but I declined, though I did give him my social. He was liking my stories & making small talk with me for months before I was back in his city. When I was in town, I would let him know & he would take me out. After several months & several dates, I was trying to gauge if he liked me or if this was strictly platonic, so I asked him & got ghosted. I waited two weeks, because I knew he had a vacation coming up, for an answer before removing him from my socials. 

What I learned this year as a 30F, that’s only had a handful of relationships, my second to last one lasted 8 years, is that ghosting sucks for all those involved. I gave my LDR the closure he asked for although it took me months. I’m in therapy again & working on my own issues. I’m still not over the fact that I got ghosted & I still think about him but it’s more because of the potential future he made me envision. 

I feel quite disheartened about the dating culture as this seems to be quite the norm. I know I’m a part of the bigger problem but I’m working on it. But if anyone has any advice, I’m open to hearing them as I feel quite lost being back on the dating market after basically spending my all of 20s with one person.

And then basically saying it's weird that he asked...

I will be paraphrasing texts to try and be concise - so they will sound choppy.

I (30F) matched and went on a date with ""Sam"" (36M) at the end of the summer. It went well, we had coffee - did an activity - and then grabbed dinner ( very PG, no kiss even.) Prior to the date we had amazing texting chemistry, to the point I was questioning if he was love bombing me. We tried to go on a second date a few weeks later but he had to cancel due to work, and he ended up telling me that he wasn't sure he had time to date and we should just be friends. We try to text as friends but he kind of got cold tbh so I stopped talking to him for about 5 weeks.

At the end of Nov we started texting again here and there. And it gradually became flirty and we talked about trying for that second date. Well, I brought up trying to get together a few times and he didn't really bite or was busy.

But a few days ago he brought up going to Jamaica together over Christmas. I thought he was teasing/joking so I humoured him a bit while also being sarcastic. Eventually I told him I thought he was joking but then he assured me he wasn't, to which I responded with an incredulous no. He made a joke about me being a buzzkill, and I responded sarcastically with ""yes lol, it's almost like I'm reasonable and value my safety"". He then got offended that I was implying he was unsafe, to which I said ""no, but going to Jamaica for second date is ... a lot to ask of someone"". He responded with something along the lines of ""I thought you'd want to go, I guess I was wrong"". I asked him if he understood why I couldn't do that. He said not really.

So I told him that objectively asking someone to go out of the country with them having only met once is a bad idea. Also, that I don't feel like we know each other well enough yet to travel together, even if it was just a weekend road trip even. (Not to mention that it's expensive and it's Christmas- I have plans). I said it was also really out of the blue as he never tried to get together before, so it was confusing.

He then went on about how if I just wasn't interested in him I should say so, and even tho I say it's not about him, it feels like it is.

I tell him ""no I am interested in him, I want to get to know him better... It has nothing to do with him as a person, but I just would never travel with a man I met once in person...""

He responds with something along the lines of , ""I genuinely thought you'd like to go, my mistake"". I say it is just a misunderstanding, I'm sorry I thought he was joking and I wasn't more direct from the start, but I would like to see him again still. He then stops responding.

Honestly... wth? I can't get him to grab a coffee with me, but he wants to go to Jamaica, then is offended when I say I'm not comfortable with that... and makes me feel guilty for saying no?

(He also mentioned at one point that he won't go by himself because it's a better deal with 2 people... and the website looked sketchy, like AI pics)

I may have led him on a bit when I thought he was joking (just by asking questions about the trip- never agreed to go), but when I realized he wasn't I tried to be playful but kind while saying a firm no.

Six months ago, I had to wear a blindfold and earmuffs to avoid stimulation. Covid gave me severe ME/CFS. Around five months ago, I started taking LDN. Ever since then, I’ve been steadily improving. I can play video games now. I can drink coffee again. I can listen to music. I can facetime my family. I can get up to refill my water bottle.

Three days ago, I decided to try something bold: I helped my husband bake some goods for Christmas. I felt pretty tired by the end, but I woke up feeling better. On Christmas Eve, my family came to visit for like four hours, and I felt relatively normal. By the end, I felt a bit out of it—but that’s it. I felt rejuvenated the next morning, which is something I haven’t felt in a long time. (NSFW warning) Yesterday, I had good sex for the first time since I’ve gotten ill. I realized afterwards that my arms and legs were the sort of sore one feels after a workout. I thought for sure I’d crash today, but… I didn’t. I feel better than I did when I went to bed.

Where do I go from here? I am so afraid to be happy because I don’t want to be disappointed. I don’t even know how to celebrate these little wins without fear. Should I start slowly going on walks (an activity I sorely miss) again? Should I keep to my normal routine for a while? To anyone who has recovered, what did you do when you first started to feel like you saw the light at the end of the tunnel? Were you afraid it was just an illusion, or someone holding a flash light playing a nasty trick?

1hmmk2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hmmk2h/how_do_i_get_over_obsessive_patterns/,How do I get over obsessive patterns?,"Hi everyone! I (F22) have been dealing with obsession and obsessive patterns for 2-3 years now, and would love some advice. I have talked to family, friends and professionals about this, and yet I still find myself falling back into old thoughts and habits. Sorry for the long post.


So, I became very obsessed with a man, and here’s some backstory.

We met at the gym, and he was hands down the most handsome man I’ve EVER seen in my life. So you best believe I was over the moon when we started having eye contact and smiled at each other. And coincidentally we both liked the same coffee shop in town, and would see each other there too.

When we finally started talking (i took initiative first) I could simply not relax and be myself. He was older than me, had his life together and seemed so relaxed and confident in himself. Meanwhile, I was the opposite. Younger, did not have my life together, anxious by nature and so scared of not being good enough. 

I think my obsession really began during the eye contact phase, so you can imagine how intense it was when we were actually talking. I was at the coffee shop everyday, at the gym everyday, checked my phone every second, checked his instagram constantly, I even started checking his snapscore when he was too slow at replying. It came to a point where I couldn’t eat or sleep properly. And that was when I decided, that this wasn’t for me, even though every fiber of my body wanted him so bad.

So, I just deleted him from my snap and instagram. Just ghosted him. Which I know is so rude and stupid. I was 20 years old at the time, and have since grown so much. I know now that I would have done everything so differently. And yes, I still regret the way I handled everything till this day.

We talked in total for for 2-3 weeks.

But even though the communication stopped, my obsession certainly did not. I tried moving on by getting into a new relationship, which didn’t work. (we broke up after half a year) The guy got into a relationship himself a few months after we stopped talking, and they’re still together till this day. That was a rollercoaster of jealousy as well.



Now, it has gotten better over the past year and a half. I started avoiding the places he usually would be. I do not look up at his apartment when I pass by. And I avoid entertaining any and all thoughts about him.  These are the only things that have helped so far. But oh man, I still fall into the obsessive thoughts sometimes..

I am currently in a very healthy relationship of 1 year with my boyfriend. I made sure to tell him about my obsession and experience early on in the relationship and we actually bonded over it - he has had a similar experience with obsession before. But now, I just really want to completely move on..

When I see the guy in public my heart starts racing, I become incredibly aware of my body and its all I can think about. I can barely enjoy a coffee when I’m out and I know he’s around.. It almost feels like a panic attack or an anxious reaction? We live close by in a medium sized town, so I see him fairly often. Moving is not an option yet.

I also consistently dream about him, either he’s with his gf or he tells me they have broken up - and when that happens it’s like I get the crush all over again.



So, what can I do to really get over the lingering obsession? Any advice would be appreciated❤️",2,1735212628.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 Rejected


Amarah

My name is Amarah Raven, I am a twenty one year old Werewolf and the future Alpha of White Crescent Pack. Yes, you read that correctly I am the future Alpha and our Pack is the largest and strongest Pack there is.

Hearing the Omegas talk about my parents has me stopping dead in my tracks, my parents have been ruling our Pack for almost forty years and they don’t want to celebrate. 

“Alastor, where are you?” I ask my baby Brother through our mind-link and as I rush up the stairs I link my best friends.

“Did you know Mom and Dad have been ruling for almost forty years?” I ask him as I open the door to Alastor’s room and his eyes fly open as he mutters “Fuck” before he sits up straight. 

I link one of the Omegas to have breakfast delivered to my office for all of us and as soon as we are all sitting, Alastor and I tell them what the reason for our meeting is. We know we need a lot of help organizing this and I tell each of them what I expect them to do.

We are able to get every Pack-member to help in one way or another, from decorations to color scheme and we manage to do it without our parents finding out. I am even able to enlist the help of Luna Jess of Silver Moon Pack, she will take care of inviting some of our Allies.

In a matter of three weeks we have to get everything organized and on the day of the party, Alastor and I will take our parents out to dinner. 

I am even wearing a dress to humor Mom, everyone knows that I don’t like to wear a dress and if I can avoid it for the rest of my life I will. 

It is an emerald green, floor length, one shoulder dress with a split starting mid-thigh on the left. Three string of shiny stones run from my right shoulder down my back to just above my ass and I top it off with black velvet high heeled ankle boots. 

The Friday of the party comes as it always does and after lunch Mom and I go upstairs to get our hair and make-up done, after which we get into our dresses and Mom looks gorgeous in her royal blue, floor length dress.

Blue and gold is the color scheme, just as it was at their Alpha and Luna Ceremony and when I see Dad I am stunned. He is wearing a black three pieced suit with a royal blue button-up shirt and so is Alastor. 

“I had a small surprise made for you,” Alastor says as he pulls out two black mask. “Would you mind putting these on?” he asks and Mom and Dad take them without hesitation. We both grab hold of an arm and lead them through the Pack-house to the backdoor.

Melia and Rhea are waiting for us at the back porch and they take up position behind Mom and Dad, they pull away the masks at the same time. Mom and Dad look stunned at the scene in front of them and I see tears form in Mom’s eyes, looks like we did an excellent job.

Eos signals the DJ to start the music and soon Mom and Dad are off to mingle with their guests, laughing and smiling they walk around. Alastor and I watch from a distance with smiles on our faces.

After an hour I get on to a small stage and everyone quiets down, “Thank you all so much for coming. My Mom and Dad stood here forty years ago to swear to each of you that they would be your Alpha and Luna until the day they would step down.” I start the speech I prepared for tonight.

Everyone is having an amazing time and I talk to every Alpha and Luna that is present. I dance with Gammas and Betas and even with some of our own Warriors, really enjoying myself despite wearing a dress.

It is a little after midnight when I decide to get changed into something a bit more within my comfort zone and as I walk in through the back door I get hit by an intoxicating scent, a scent I smelled a few times during the evening.

I had not been able to locate the scent with all those Wolves around, because it came and quickly went away every time. This time I sniff the air and I know that however the scent belongs to is inside the Pack-house, I slowly walk further into the hallway.

With every step I take the scent becomes stronger and Minerva, my Wolf, is jumping up and down in my head, making me giggle at her. I am at the bottom of the stairs when I realize that the scent is coming from upstairs and I get an inkling feeling.

Minerva is now pacing in my head and like me she doesn’t like where this is leading us. As I reach the first floor Minerva whispers “Mate” and I start walking towards the guest rooms on this floor, but I know that we don’t have anyone spending the night here.

Suddenly a noise stops me dead in my tracks and Minerva and I are on high alert, being an Alpha’s Daughter makes me react faster than most. I turn around to see if there is someone behind me and when I am satisfied I am alone in the hallway I turn back around.

After taking two more steps I am on high alert again, but this time I know the sound is coming from somewhere in front of me and tentatively I take another step. Slowly but steadily I get closer to the scent and slowly a smile appears on my face, I believe Minerva is right.

Minerva is getting more agitated the closer we get to the scent, but she can’t explain to me why and I decide to ignore her for the time being. Following the scent has lead me to the last room on my right and as I put my hand on the doorknob I hear someone groan.

Not knowing what might be behind the door I quietly turn the doorknob and I start pushing the door open slowly and quietly. My eyes widen at the scene in front of me and Minerva is roaring in my head.

A male is standing at the foot of the bed and in front of him is a woman on all fours, they are so engrossed with one and other that they don’t even notice me. The male slowly turns his head towards me as he keeps pounding into the female, he has a smirk on his face and I realize that even the female is looking at me now.

“I, Damien of Dark Mountain Pack, reject you as my Mate. I don’t need a barbie doll.” The male says and I hear Minerva whimper in my head, I know he is our mate but he really doesn’t want us. 

“I, Amarah of White Cresent Pack, reject you as my Mate.” I reply and the Male crashes to the floor in pain.



Chapter 2 Find Out


Amarah

I don’t remember how I got up the stairs or how I got to my room. I don’t remember getting out of my dress or into the bathroom, and I don’t remember getting into the shower.

But that’s where my Mother found me early in the morning, still silently crying at the loss of my Mate.

Minerva has been quiet ever since I walked away from our Mate. I tell her that I understand she is hurting, and that I don’t have the words to comfort her, but that I am here whenever she needs me. For the first time today, I feel her presence, and I feel a little relieved at that.

Alpha Atlas

My Mate and I are enjoying the party our Pups organized for us behind our backs. They did an excellent job, enlisting the help of everyone willing to assist. Amarah even got Luna Jess to help her with the invitations, and I think I’ve thanked her for that four times already.

My Mate was surprised to see they used the color scheme from forty years ago. But when Melia told us her Mom had helped them with that, it explained everything. Amarah is wearing a dress for once, and she looks absolutely stunning.

Amarah never was a girl to wear dresses, and from the moment she was able to make that known to us, we had a battle every time my Mate tried to get her to wear one. This is the third time I’m seeing my Daughter in a dress, and I know she’ll never wear one again if it’s up to her.

It’s nearly morning when we finally decide to call it a night. Most of the guests that weren’t from our Pack left around one in the morning, and now there are only a handful of Pack members left in the backyard.

My Mate tells me she’ll check on our Pups before joining me in our room. I smile at her as I nod my head; no matter how old they get, she will still check on them before turning in herself. I get out of my suit and go through my evening routine when I suddenly feel my Mate’s distress.

I rush out of our room in a pair of shorts, and I hear her softly talking to Amarah, but I can’t make out what they are saying. She must have felt my presence as she links me and tells me to go to bed and wait for her.

Ten minutes later, my Mate walks in with a sad expression on her face. She tells me what she found when she went to check on Amarah, and I ask her if she told her what had happened. My Mate says she didn’t, but she hadn’t seen any injuries on her.

Amarah spends the day in her room, and I call her friends to my office, hoping to find out more, but they don’t have any answers for me either. Ione asks if they can investigate this on their own, and she’ll inform me once they’ve found something.

Something happened to my Daughter, and I intend to find out what it is and who is responsible. I will make whoever hurt my little girl pay for what they did, and they will regret it. My Wolf is roaring in my head at whoever did this to her.

Amarah stays in her room during dinner, something she has never done before, and everyone is talking about it.

Alastor tells them that something happened during the party, but that Amarah has not told anyone anything yet. He hopes that whoever knows anything will come forward.

No one seems to know anything about what might have happened, and Ione hasn’t come to me yet, indicating they haven’t found anything either. Knowing my Pack members, everyone will try to help find the answers I need.

My Mate and I have a restless night as we keep worrying about our Daughter. In the early morning hours, roars and growls make both of us jump out of bed. I link my Gamma to find out what is going on.

He tells me he was woken up by a mind-link, only stating to come to the borders.

Amarah

I wake up in the middle of the night to a very agitated Minerva, and she tells me we need to go for a run. I quietly make my way down the stairs as everyone else is fast asleep, and as soon as I walk out the back door, Minerva takes over, making a run for the border.

She crosses the border without slowing down, sniffing the air in search of rogues, and I hope that she will be able to get rid of some of the pent-up anger raging through her.

It doesn’t take her long to find a rogue roaming near our northern border. She toys with him for a while before tearing him to pieces, leaving his body close to the border. She takes another sniff of the air before taking off running again.

After a few hours, she has killed six rogues, and I can tell that she has calmed down a little, but I know it will take a few more nights like this before she comes to terms with what Damien did. We rush back towards the border, and again she doesn’t slow down as we cross the border.

Roars and howls wake me a few hours later, and I know our Warriors have found the rogues Minerva took out during the night. I hear footsteps running around the Pack house and softer rushed footsteps inside, indicating that everyone was woken up.

I decide to get dressed and go see Dad to tell him Minerva took out those rogues, but Minerva shows me the scene with Damien again. I know she needs this to get it out of her system, and Dad will order us to stay within the borders as soon as he finds out it was Minerva.

Deciding not to tell Dad, I fall back on my bed again, Damien’s rejection running through my mind once more, and the tears start flowing again. The day repeats itself, spending my time in bed and crying for the loss of my Mate. Minerva and I both don’t understand why, and I guess we’ll never find out the answer to that question.

He said he didn’t want a Barbie doll, but how could he say that, seeing we never met before? Anyone that knows me will tell you I am anything but a Barbie doll. No, I think he used that as an excuse to reject me, and if I ever meet him again, I will make him regret this.

I ignore the knocks on my door, and I ignore the pushes against my barrier on the mind-link. Only Mom opens my door after I don’t respond to her knocking. Just like yesterday, she makes sure my food is brought up to my room, and just like yesterday, I don’t leave my room.



Chapter 3 Answers


Ione

After hearing from Alpha Atlas that something had happened to Amarah, we went to her office to find some answers. So far, all we know is that she left the party before most of the guests, but after that, no one seems to know where she went.

None of us got much sleep, as we were worried about our best friend. This morning, before heading to Amarah’s office, I asked Dad if he had any idea where to look next. He told me to use the security cameras to see where she went after leaving the party.

As Melia and I eat breakfast, we watch the security footage outside to see where she went. To our surprise, she walks into the Pack house, telling us that whatever happened, it happened inside.

I know that our security cameras record both image and sound—something Dad told me is useful if you can’t see someone’s face. I hoped this would explain what happened in the Pack house better than just watching the footage.

Rhea and Eos walk into the office as I search for the footage from inside the Pack house. Once I find it, I put it on the big screen so we can all see it at the same time. We see her enter through the backdoor, and it takes us only a second to realize that she found her Mate.

Instead of saying or asking anything, we watch the screen as it unfolds the most horrifying thing I have ever seen. I think I would rather watch a massacre over and over again than ever see this again. As I look at my friends, I know I am not the only one.

It took us hours to find all the footage from inside the Pack house. Now that we have finally found the answer to our question, my Wolf wants to kill someone. It is close to dinnertime, and I know I have to let Alpha Atlas know what we found—something I am not looking forward to.

“Alpha, could you come to Amarah’s office and bring everyone with you?” I tell him through the mind-link. Within seconds, all our parents, Amarah’s parents, and her Brother walk in. I tell my Dad I followed his advice and found out what happened during the night of the party.

Melia starts the video feed, and like us, they quickly realize what must have happened. But Melia stops the feed before we get to the point where her life changed for good. “I don’t know….” I start, but I am not sure how to say what I want to say. Eos is the one to help me out.

“Alpha Atlas, I would rather spend twenty-four hours reading through our history than ever see this again,” Eos says. Alastor pales, as we all know how much she hated it when we went to school.

Alpha Atlas tells Melia to start the feed again, and we all watch as she walks down the hallway toward the soft sounds. Eos walks toward the window as the feed jumps to another camera in the hallway. As we see Amarah slowly open the door, I hear Alpha Atlas growl, which only gets louder the more he sees.

Our Mothers have tears running down their cheeks as they hear the words spoken by the male. Alastor yells, “I am going to kill you, Damien,” before he even mentions his name, and I wonder how he knew who the male was, as I didn’t.

Our Fathers are growling and roaring, while our Mothers are heartbroken. We keep watching as Amarah slowly makes her way up to her room, staggering up the stairs. Once she is in her room, Melia cuts the feed. None of us say a word as we try to make sense of what we saw.

Alastor asks why he referred to Amarah as a Barbie doll, and I have no idea what answer to give him. “Maybe because she was wearing a dress,” Rhea whispers. “She looked like a porcelain doll in that dress, and I doubt he ever saw her in her usual outfits.”

We all know she is probably right. Amarah looked amazing in her dress, and anyone who didn’t know her would have thought she was a spoiled little brat. But that’s not an accurate picture of Amarah—she is the best Warrior we have and our future Alpha.

Amarah

I hear my Dad roar, and I wonder if he found out what happened. Soon he is joined by his Beta and Gamma, and I even hear my Brother roar—it sounds like they are beyond pissed. Minerva roars in my head as the tears come once more. I didn’t think I had any left, but apparently, I was wrong.

Mom walks in with my dinner on a tray, and I know she will not ask me to come downstairs to have dinner with everyone else. She tells me they know what happened and that Dad wants to inform the Pack about it, show them the footage of the video feed.

I tell her Dad is allowed to inform the Pack, but to make it clear that no one is to bring it up in my presence. Unless, of course, I bring it up myself. Our Pack will be outraged, and I know that once they have seen it, I will hear roars throughout the Pack.

It doesn’t take long before I hear the first roars, and when I hear them about an hour later, I know Dad just informed the Wolves that had been on patrol. Minerva is becoming restless again, and I know that tonight will be a repeat of last night.

She needs it as an outlet for the anger she feels toward our former Mate, just as I need to let the tears fall. I just hope that someday we will be able to put this behind us and accept our second chance Mate if we are lucky enough to find him.

It is something Minerva and I do not want to think about right now, but maybe someday we will be able to think about it without feeling heartbroken and sad. For the past three years, Minerva and I had wondered what our Mate would look like, what kind of person he would be, and if we had ever met him before.

It is uncommon for us to find our Mate on the day we turn eighteen. Usually, it takes a few years, as we don’t interact with other Packs on a daily basis, and we had always believed in a happy-ever-after.

Most Werewolves are taught that the Mate-bond is a sacred bond—a bond to be cherished—and most Werewolves wait for their fated Mate. However, there are Werewolves who believe a fated Mate is a weakness, so they choose a Mate instead.

My eyes slowly close as my body finally gives in to the exhaustion from crying my eyes out all day. His face haunts me in my sleep, his words haunt me in my sleep, and there is nothing I can do about it.



Chapter 4 Asteria


Amarah

Again, I wake up in the middle of the night and quickly make my way out of the Pack house to hand over control to Minerva, giving her the chance to deal with the pain she’s feeling. She doesn’t waste any time, crossing our border without being spotted by one of our Warriors.

It doesn’t take long for her to find a Rogue and shred him to pieces. She keeps running along our borders, and some of the Rogues flee the moment they see Minerva approaching. Those Rogues are left alone as they pose no threat to our Pack.

About an hour before sunrise, we run along our eastern border from south to north. Suddenly, Minerva stops dead in her tracks, sniffing the air as she scans her surroundings. “Blood, not a Rogue,” she tells me, and slowly makes her way toward a cluster of trees and boulders.

The scent of blood grows stronger the closer we get, and Minerva slows down even further, scanning her surroundings. Suddenly, her ears perk up as we hear soft whimpers coming from within the cluster of trees and boulders.

Minerva steps cautiously into the trees to reveal a female covered in blood, with her arms wrapped around a Pup. I ask Minerva to give me back control, and the female’s eyes widen as I stand before her. She clearly wasn’t expecting a female to show up.

“Please, don’t send us back. Please, don’t tell anyone we are here,” she whispers, her voice laced with despair. I crouch down in front of her, taking in the cuts and bruises on her body. Minerva roars in my head at the sight of her injuries.

“I won’t send you back, but I need to warn our Pack doctor. I need to know that your Wolf will be able to heal this on her own, and I need to inform my Pack so our Warriors can keep an eye on you,” I tell her gently. It takes a few minutes before she responds.

“My Wolf says she can heal this on her own as long as we don’t have to start running again. I don’t know if I want anyone else to know that I’m here. Can you give me a few days to think about it?” she asks, and I decide to give her some time to calm down and rest.

I tell her I’ll be back in a few minutes. I shift into Minerva before bolting from the cluster toward our eastern border. I quietly make my way into the Pack house to gather some supplies and food for the female and her Pup.

Once I’ve handed her everything I brought with me, I tell her my name and find out her name is Asteria, and her Pup’s name is Inti. “I’ll be back tomorrow night. Get some sleep and eat something,” I say before leaving the cluster once again.

It has been four days since the rejection and three days since Asteria showed up. Inti has come out of his shell, hugging Minerva the moment we enter the cluster, and we both enjoy those moments. Asteria finally told me what had happened to them, and I had to let Minerva out to deal with her anger.

After we talked for a while longer, she finally agreed with me on telling our Pack. It will give us the chance to keep an eye on them and maybe we will be able to find out if it’s safe for her to return home. Not that Asteria is as optimistic about that as I am.

I crash on my bed to get a few hours of sleep before informing Dad about what Minerva and I have been doing at night and about our guests hiding in the cluster. It doesn’t take me long to drift off to sleep, and for the first time since my rejection, I sleep without dreaming.

As I slowly open my eyes, I realize I slept straight through. Even though it still hurts thinking about Damien, I know that Minerva and I will survive. I walk into the bathroom to take a shower, and after that, I get dressed, ready to face the world again.

Everyone acts as if I haven’t been avoiding them for days as I walk into the dining room. After I sit down, I tell Dad that I need to talk to him with all of our leadership Wolves. Alastor sits beside me, placing his hand on my knee, giving me the calm I need as I see some females staring and whispering about me.

I stand in front of the window, looking at some Pups playing on the lawn to the left of our Pack house, and I wish I could see Inti running with them. “Dad, I know everyone is aware of what happened. I don’t want to talk about it, but I have to tell you how Minerva has been dealing with it,” I say.

Turning around, I see that everyone is waiting for me to start talking. “The Rogues that were found near our borders were Minerva’s doing. It was the only way for her to deal with everything without hurting the ones we love.” Mom wraps me in her arms, while Dad tells me he already suspected as much.

“Are you going to be okay?” Alastor asks as he hugs me, and I tell him that it will take time, but that I am already feeling better. “Dad, there’s something else we need to talk about. Did the Elders or the Council send a message about Little Crescent Pack?” I ask him, and he nods.

He hands me the message, and the more I read, the angrier Minerva becomes. 

“Amarah, what’s going on?” he asks, as everyone can feel the anger radiating from my body. I take a few deep breaths, trying to calm Minerva down.

“The contents of this message are a bunch of lies,” I respond. “Khonsu’s Brother didn’t die in a Rogue attack. Khonsu killed him and tried to forcefully mark Luna Asteria. He also tried to kill her Pup, Inti, but he failed at that as Luna Asteria protected him.

Khonsu always wanted what his Brother had, even as little Pups. When his Brother found his fated Mate, Khonsu tried to seduce Asteria, but she told her Mate about what Khonsu had tried to do, and he removed Khonsu from the Pack-house to protect his Mate.

Luna Asteria managed to escape her Pack’s territory with Inti. She kept running until she was too exhausted to continue and took shelter in the cluster of trees and boulders near our eastern border. She is fully healed now, and she and Inti are doing much better than the night I met them,” I say as I look at my Father.

We discuss the options we have, and Dad decides that I’m right. With Asteria hiding in no-man’s land, we won’t be lying if we say that she is not in our Pack’s territory. Instead of having a meeting in front of the Pack house, Dad links the entire Pack at once and explains the situation.

Everyone is ordered to keep her presence a secret, and with the Alpha command in place, I know Asteria and Inti are safe. 

I follow Dad out of his office, and I’m surprised to see that an Omega is putting clothes, toys, and other items into a bag.

“Alpha, some of our Pack members have brought supplies for Luna Asteria and Inti. Where would you like me to put them?” she asks, and I smile as Dad tells her to put them in his office. He informs me that he will accompany me tonight.

Our Head Warrior approaches me and Dad to tell us that every Warrior has volunteered to visit them at night and to bring them whatever they need. Happiness and pride fill my heart as I realize that our Pack considers them as one of our own.

That night, I visit Asteria with my Dad, and when we tell her what’s going on in our Pack, she rewards us with a smile. Inti is happy with his toys and clothes; Asteria is happy with the support she’s been given, and she tells me that for the first time since her Mate was killed, she feels calm again.

We have all fallen into a routine that works for all of us. Asteria and Inti have their day and night rhythms reversed—they sleep during the day and are awake at night. Pack members take turns teaching Inti everything he would normally learn in school and helping Asteria with whatever they can.

Khonsu is still searching for her and still sticks to his story, even though most Packs have found inconsistencies with it. The Elders are not eager to give him any information, and so far, no one has shown up on our doorstep to ask about Asteria and Inti.

We received a message from Council member Boaz, stating that Khonsu was still searching for Asteria and that they had questioned him about the events of that night. He had refused to come in, using his search for Asteria as an excuse, but the Council is not giving him much time to dodge them.

Two weeks after Damien rejected me, he informed the Elders that he had found his Mate, and that had set off a new string of sleepless nights for me, while Minerva had once again taken to hunting down Rogues and shredding them to pieces.

Dad had a video conference with the Elders and a Council member the day he found out what happened. When Damien reported finding his Mate, they called Dad to ask what I wanted to do. Dad told them to leave it as it was—that his Pack would feel the consequences one day.

Realizing I needed something to take my mind off Damien, Dad told me he was stepping down, and that gave me enough to keep me busy. 

I had been trained by Dad for years, and I knew I could handle the job, but I was nervous nonetheless.

Today is the day I will take over from my Father, and we both know that some of our allied Alphas will not agree with him. They may or may not break their alliance with us, but truth be told, I don’t care, and neither does my Father.

Alastor has been over the moon, to say the least. I don’t understand why, as I am becoming Alpha and not him. 

Alastor once told me and Dad that he was glad Dad didn’t believe only a male could take the position of Alpha. When we asked him why, he smiled and said, “I don’t have the patience to deal with crap.”

Dad and I had laughed our asses off because it’s true that Alastor lacks patience in some areas. 

Alpha Drew and Luna Jess are the first to arrive. After just one look at me, they both know that I will be taking over instead of Alastor.



Chapter 5 Long Awaited


When I took over from my Father, a lot of Alphas had been shocked.

Most High-ranking Wolves give their position to their Sons even if they have a first-born Daughter. In the history of my Pack there have been two other females that could take over the Alpha title from their Father, but both decided they didn’t want to.

I on the other hand have always known that I wanted the title when the time came and with my Father’s Beta, Gamma and Deltas also having first born Daughters all our Highest-ranking positions are filled by females.

When my Father stepped down as Alpha and when the Elders had sent out the notification to every Pack some Alphas had torn up the alliance we had with them. It didn’t bother me as it was something my Father and I had expected.

Of the nine alliances we had four that were broken when I took over, but the other five stayed loyal as each of their Alphas had seen me grow up and they knew I would be as good an Alpha as my Father had been. One of those Packs lives to the south of us and together we keep an eye on the no-mans land between our Pack territories.

That clearing is used by anyone that wants to travel from one side of our Pack territories to the other side and most of those travelers have no ill intentions, but some are Rogues that will try to get onto our Pack territory. They only get one warning, if that doesn’t scare them off, they die.

I know that not all Rogues are bad and the ones that have no ill intentions are also the ones that only need one warning, the others don’t care whether they life or die as long as they think there is something to gain. So I must always pay attention to the Rogues.

Right now, I am sitting in one of the watch spots along our border, my eyes shift left to right and back again as I keep an eye out for Rogues. 

Our eastern border patrols tightened after three Rogues crossed into our neighbor’s territory ten years ago, killing two pack members. 

I can still hear Dad’s roar that morning when Alpha Damon informed him. He gathered the Warriors on duty, but no one had seen the Rogues. After a long investigation with his Beta and Gamma, they found nothing.

I was sixteen then, and determined to help. 

I called my friends for a sleepover, and that night, we snuck out to watch the patrol ourselves. 

After an hour of observing, we saw the problem: our Warriors run the borders from north to south at the east border, and they run the borders clockwise, but as they near the south border they all take a short cut, leaving a blind spot—exactly where the Rogues crossed.

The next morning, we told Dad what we discovered. He was furious at us for sneaking out, but more so at the Warriors for endangering the pack. 

He called every Warrior not on border patrol to the Pack-house and the ones on border patrol were included through the mind-link.

“As some of you may have heard three Rogues crossed the west border of Dark Mountain Pack and killed two of their Pack-members. We couldn’t find anything wrong with our border runs and I can assure you that your Beta, your Gamma and I went over everything.

Our Pups were the ones that pointed out how they were able to cross the border without being spotted. They watched you for an hour last night and each and everyone of you takes a short cut from the eastern border to the southern border.

This will no longer be tolerated, as of right now you will run the borders the way they are and I will make sure that you will be randomly checked. Am I making myself clear?” The look on his face is murderous and the Warriors all answer with “Yes, Alpha.”

Since that day, our Warriors have patrolled diligently, but one of our older Warriors suggested we set up hidden watch points along the borders, like in his former pack. 

I proposed the idea to Dad, and after refining it with his Beta and Gamma, we implemented it. 

Now, I sit at one of those hidden spots, armed with my bow and arrows, ensuring no Rogue crosses our borders again.

I see movement across the clearing and know it’s one of their Warriors on border patrol. I still haven’t figured out how they conduct their patrols, and truth be told, I don’t really care. But I do wonder if they’re aware of the fact that we have stopped dozens of Rogues since that night.

“Alpha, you have a visitor,” I hear my Beta say through the mind-link. I tell the Warriors with me that I’m heading back to the Pack house for some Pack business. They both nod but don’t take their eyes off the clearing.

Before heading to the Pack house, I step out of the tree line and look in the direction of a small cluster of trees and boulders. I know who lives there, and so does every Warrior in my Pack, but we don’t mention it to outsiders as it might put her life at risk.

I know who my visitor is, but I don’t know why he’s here. I’ve been thinking about his reason for showing up ever since he announced his visit. No answer has come to mind, but I guess I’ll find out soon enough why he’s gracing me with a visit.

As I walk back to the Pack house, I pass many of my Pack members. Like my Father, I greet each and every one of them as I pass. 

I smile at the antics of a little Pup and grab a hold of him just before he tumbles down. 

“Thank you, Alpha,” the little Pup says before I put him back on his feet.

One of my Deltas joins me as I near the back of the Pack house, and the two of us make our way to my official office on the ground floor. 

I ask an Omega we pass if she can bring us some coffee, and she rushes off to the kitchen to comply with my request.

As I walk into my office, my visitor gets up from his seat. 

“Elder Ezra, please take a seat,” I say, and he sits back down in the chair he just got out of as I take a seat behind my desk. 

“To what do we owe this pleasure, Elder?” I ask.

Elder Ezra pulls an envelope from his bag and puts it on my desk in front of me. I stare at the envelope for a moment. I know what’s in it just by looking at it, and I have to suppress the smile that wants to spread across my face.

I have only seen it once before, lying on this same desk over a decade ago when my Father was still the Alpha. 

I have been waiting for this day ever since I took over from my Father, and I know I will enjoy this very much, as will my Wolf.

“Alpha, in the file you’ll find a list of the Packs that have been invited as well. All the rules, regulations, and conditions are in there, along with my number, just in case you still have unanswered questions,” he says as he gets out of his seat.

“Thank you, Elder Ezra. I will read it all and contact you if something is unclear to me,” I say as I shake his hand. I guide him out of the Pack house to his car and watch him drive off. 

A smirk appears on my face as soon as he is out of sight.

“That’s about damn time,” my Gamma mumbles, and we all start laughing. 

We walk back to my office, and as we’re about to enter, one of the Omegas walks out, telling me she has placed the coffee in my office as she heads back to the kitchen.

I sit down in my favorite armchair facing my desk, while my Beta, Gamma, and Deltas sit on the couches to my left and right. The five of us grew up together—if you saw one of us, the rest were soon to follow, making it easy for our parents to find us.

I open the envelope, already knowing what’s inside: an invitation to the Alpha bloodline competition. 

The smirk on my face gets bigger as I pull it out. I have been waiting a long time for this moment, and I will enjoy putting all those cocky Alphas and their siblings in their place.

The Alpha bloodline competition is held every year for a select few Packs. They get invited by the Elders and get to beat the crap out of each other legally. Every person from an Alpha bloodline in that Pack is allowed to enter the competition.

The Council doesn’t interfere with this competition, even though they love the fights between the Alphas, and some of them even come to see the invited Alphas fight. Our King has never shown his face at the competition, and Dad doubts he ever will.

I read through all the rules and regulations for the competition. The more I read, the bigger the smile on my face becomes, and I know everyone present in my office can tell that I’ve found a way for the participants to underestimate me.

The rules state that the first name drawn gets the choice to fully shift into Wolf form or go Half-shift. But there’s a loophole—the opponent doesn’t have to follow. They just can’t shift fully if the first fighter chooses Half. 

I’ll use that to my advantage. Let them think they know what I’m capable of.

Chapter 1 Rejected


Amarah

My name is Amarah Raven, I am a twenty one year old Werewolf and the future Alpha of White Crescent Pack. Yes, you read that correctly I am the future Alpha and our Pack is the largest and strongest Pack there is.

Hearing the Omegas talk about my parents has me stopping dead in my tracks, my parents have been ruling our Pack for almost forty years and they don’t want to celebrate. 

“Alastor, where are you?” I ask my baby Brother through our mind-link and as I rush up the stairs I link my best friends.

“Did you know Mom and Dad have been ruling for almost forty years?” I ask him as I open the door to Alastor’s room and his eyes fly open as he mutters “Fuck” before he sits up straight. 

I link one of the Omegas to have breakfast delivered to my office for all of us and as soon as we are all sitting, Alastor and I tell them what the reason for our meeting is. We know we need a lot of help organizing this and I tell each of them what I expect them to do.

We are able to get every Pack-member to help in one way or another, from decorations to color scheme and we manage to do it without our parents finding out. I am even able to enlist the help of Luna Jess of Silver Moon Pack, she will take care of inviting some of our Allies.

In a matter of three weeks we have to get everything organized and on the day of the party, Alastor and I will take our parents out to dinner. 

I am even wearing a dress to humor Mom, everyone knows that I don’t like to wear a dress and if I can avoid it for the rest of my life I will. 

It is an emerald green, floor length, one shoulder dress with a split starting mid-thigh on the left. Three string of shiny stones run from my right shoulder down my back to just above my ass and I top it off with black velvet high heeled ankle boots. 

The Friday of the party comes as it always does and after lunch Mom and I go upstairs to get our hair and make-up done, after which we get into our dresses and Mom looks gorgeous in her royal blue, floor length dress.

Blue and gold is the color scheme, just as it was at their Alpha and Luna Ceremony and when I see Dad I am stunned. He is wearing a black three pieced suit with a royal blue button-up shirt and so is Alastor. 

“I had a small surprise made for you,” Alastor says as he pulls out two black mask. “Would you mind putting these on?” he asks and Mom and Dad take them without hesitation. We both grab hold of an arm and lead them through the Pack-house to the backdoor.

Melia and Rhea are waiting for us at the back porch and they take up position behind Mom and Dad, they pull away the masks at the same time. Mom and Dad look stunned at the scene in front of them and I see tears form in Mom’s eyes, looks like we did an excellent job.

Eos signals the DJ to start the music and soon Mom and Dad are off to mingle with their guests, laughing and smiling they walk around. Alastor and I watch from a distance with smiles on our faces.

After an hour I get on to a small stage and everyone quiets down, “Thank you all so much for coming. My Mom and Dad stood here forty years ago to swear to each of you that they would be your Alpha and Luna until the day they would step down.” I start the speech I prepared for tonight.

Everyone is having an amazing time and I talk to every Alpha and Luna that is present. I dance with Gammas and Betas and even with some of our own Warriors, really enjoying myself despite wearing a dress.

It is a little after midnight when I decide to get changed into something a bit more within my comfort zone and as I walk in through the back door I get hit by an intoxicating scent, a scent I smelled a few times during the evening.

I had not been able to locate the scent with all those Wolves around, because it came and quickly went away every time. This time I sniff the air and I know that however the scent belongs to is inside the Pack-house, I slowly walk further into the hallway.

With every step I take the scent becomes stronger and Minerva, my Wolf, is jumping up and down in my head, making me giggle at her. I am at the bottom of the stairs when I realize that the scent is coming from upstairs and I get an inkling feeling.

Minerva is now pacing in my head and like me she doesn’t like where this is leading us. As I reach the first floor Minerva whispers “Mate” and I start walking towards the guest rooms on this floor, but I know that we don’t have anyone spending the night here.

Suddenly a noise stops me dead in my tracks and Minerva and I are on high alert, being an Alpha’s Daughter makes me react faster than most. I turn around to see if there is someone behind me and when I am satisfied I am alone in the hallway I turn back around.

After taking two more steps I am on high alert again, but this time I know the sound is coming from somewhere in front of me and tentatively I take another step. Slowly but steadily I get closer to the scent and slowly a smile appears on my face, I believe Minerva is right.

Minerva is getting more agitated the closer we get to the scent, but she can’t explain to me why and I decide to ignore her for the time being. Following the scent has lead me to the last room on my right and as I put my hand on the doorknob I hear someone groan.

Not knowing what might be behind the door I quietly turn the doorknob and I start pushing the door open slowly and quietly. My eyes widen at the scene in front of me and Minerva is roaring in my head.

A male is standing at the foot of the bed and in front of him is a woman on all fours, they are so engrossed with one and other that they don’t even notice me. The male slowly turns his head towards me as he keeps pounding into the female, he has a smirk on his face and I realize that even the female is looking at me now.

“I, Damien of Dark Mountain Pack, reject you as my Mate. I don’t need a barbie doll.” The male says and I hear Minerva whimper in my head, I know he is our mate but he really doesn’t want us. 

“I, Amarah of White Cresent Pack, reject you as my Mate.” I reply and the Male crashes to the floor in pain.



Chapter 2 Find Out


Amarah

I don’t remember how I got up the stairs or how I got to my room. I don’t remember getting out of my dress or into the bathroom, and I don’t remember getting into the shower.

But that’s where my Mother found me early in the morning, still silently crying at the loss of my Mate.

Minerva has been quiet ever since I walked away from our Mate. I tell her that I understand she is hurting, and that I don’t have the words to comfort her, but that I am here whenever she needs me. For the first time today, I feel her presence, and I feel a little relieved at that.

Alpha Atlas

My Mate and I are enjoying the party our Pups organized for us behind our backs. They did an excellent job, enlisting the help of everyone willing to assist. Amarah even got Luna Jess to help her with the invitations, and I think I’ve thanked her for that four times already.

My Mate was surprised to see they used the color scheme from forty years ago. But when Melia told us her Mom had helped them with that, it explained everything. Amarah is wearing a dress for once, and she looks absolutely stunning.

Amarah never was a girl to wear dresses, and from the moment she was able to make that known to us, we had a battle every time my Mate tried to get her to wear one. This is the third time I’m seeing my Daughter in a dress, and I know she’ll never wear one again if it’s up to her.

It’s nearly morning when we finally decide to call it a night. Most of the guests that weren’t from our Pack left around one in the morning, and now there are only a handful of Pack members left in the backyard.

My Mate tells me she’ll check on our Pups before joining me in our room. I smile at her as I nod my head; no matter how old they get, she will still check on them before turning in herself. I get out of my suit and go through my evening routine when I suddenly feel my Mate’s distress.

I rush out of our room in a pair of shorts, and I hear her softly talking to Amarah, but I can’t make out what they are saying. She must have felt my presence as she links me and tells me to go to bed and wait for her.

Ten minutes later, my Mate walks in with a sad expression on her face. She tells me what she found when she went to check on Amarah, and I ask her if she told her what had happened. My Mate says she didn’t, but she hadn’t seen any injuries on her.

Amarah spends the day in her room, and I call her friends to my office, hoping to find out more, but they don’t have any answers for me either. Ione asks if they can investigate this on their own, and she’ll inform me once they’ve found something.

Something happened to my Daughter, and I intend to find out what it is and who is responsible. I will make whoever hurt my little girl pay for what they did, and they will regret it. My Wolf is roaring in my head at whoever did this to her.

Amarah stays in her room during dinner, something she has never done before, and everyone is talking about it.

Alastor tells them that something happened during the party, but that Amarah has not told anyone anything yet. He hopes that whoever knows anything will come forward.

No one seems to know anything about what might have happened, and Ione hasn’t come to me yet, indicating they haven’t found anything either. Knowing my Pack members, everyone will try to help find the answers I need.

My Mate and I have a restless night as we keep worrying about our Daughter. In the early morning hours, roars and growls make both of us jump out of bed. I link my Gamma to find out what is going on.

He tells me he was woken up by a mind-link, only stating to come to the borders.

Amarah

I wake up in the middle of the night to a very agitated Minerva, and she tells me we need to go for a run. I quietly make my way down the stairs as everyone else is fast asleep, and as soon as I walk out the back door, Minerva takes over, making a run for the border.

She crosses the border without slowing down, sniffing the air in search of rogues, and I hope that she will be able to get rid of some of the pent-up anger raging through her.

It doesn’t take her long to find a rogue roaming near our northern border. She toys with him for a while before tearing him to pieces, leaving his body close to the border. She takes another sniff of the air before taking off running again.

After a few hours, she has killed six rogues, and I can tell that she has calmed down a little, but I know it will take a few more nights like this before she comes to terms with what Damien did. We rush back towards the border, and again she doesn’t slow down as we cross the border.

Roars and howls wake me a few hours later, and I know our Warriors have found the rogues Minerva took out during the night. I hear footsteps running around the Pack house and softer rushed footsteps inside, indicating that everyone was woken up.

I decide to get dressed and go see Dad to tell him Minerva took out those rogues, but Minerva shows me the scene with Damien again. I know she needs this to get it out of her system, and Dad will order us to stay within the borders as soon as he finds out it was Minerva.

Deciding not to tell Dad, I fall back on my bed again, Damien’s rejection running through my mind once more, and the tears start flowing again. The day repeats itself, spending my time in bed and crying for the loss of my Mate. Minerva and I both don’t understand why, and I guess we’ll never find out the answer to that question.

He said he didn’t want a Barbie doll, but how could he say that, seeing we never met before? Anyone that knows me will tell you I am anything but a Barbie doll. No, I think he used that as an excuse to reject me, and if I ever meet him again, I will make him regret this.

I ignore the knocks on my door, and I ignore the pushes against my barrier on the mind-link. Only Mom opens my door after I don’t respond to her knocking. Just like yesterday, she makes sure my food is brought up to my room, and just like yesterday, I don’t leave my room.



Chapter 3 Answers


Ione

After hearing from Alpha Atlas that something had happened to Amarah, we went to her office to find some answers. So far, all we know is that she left the party before most of the guests, but after that, no one seems to know where she went.

None of us got much sleep, as we were worried about our best friend. This morning, before heading to Amarah’s office, I asked Dad if he had any idea where to look next. He told me to use the security cameras to see where she went after leaving the party.

As Melia and I eat breakfast, we watch the security footage outside to see where she went. To our surprise, she walks into the Pack house, telling us that whatever happened, it happened inside.

I know that our security cameras record both image and sound—something Dad told me is useful if you can’t see someone’s face. I hoped this would explain what happened in the Pack house better than just watching the footage.

Rhea and Eos walk into the office as I search for the footage from inside the Pack house. Once I find it, I put it on the big screen so we can all see it at the same time. We see her enter through the backdoor, and it takes us only a second to realize that she found her Mate.

Instead of saying or asking anything, we watch the screen as it unfolds the most horrifying thing I have ever seen. I think I would rather watch a massacre over and over again than ever see this again. As I look at my friends, I know I am not the only one.

It took us hours to find all the footage from inside the Pack house. Now that we have finally found the answer to our question, my Wolf wants to kill someone. It is close to dinnertime, and I know I have to let Alpha Atlas know what we found—something I am not looking forward to.

“Alpha, could you come to Amarah’s office and bring everyone with you?” I tell him through the mind-link. Within seconds, all our parents, Amarah’s parents, and her Brother walk in. I tell my Dad I followed his advice and found out what happened during the night of the party.

Melia starts the video feed, and like us, they quickly realize what must have happened. But Melia stops the feed before we get to the point where her life changed for good. “I don’t know….” I start, but I am not sure how to say what I want to say. Eos is the one to help me out.

“Alpha Atlas, I would rather spend twenty-four hours reading through our history than ever see this again,” Eos says. Alastor pales, as we all know how much she hated it when we went to school.

Alpha Atlas tells Melia to start the feed again, and we all watch as she walks down the hallway toward the soft sounds. Eos walks toward the window as the feed jumps to another camera in the hallway. As we see Amarah slowly open the door, I hear Alpha Atlas growl, which only gets louder the more he sees.

Our Mothers have tears running down their cheeks as they hear the words spoken by the male. Alastor yells, “I am going to kill you, Damien,” before he even mentions his name, and I wonder how he knew who the male was, as I didn’t.

Our Fathers are growling and roaring, while our Mothers are heartbroken. We keep watching as Amarah slowly makes her way up to her room, staggering up the stairs. Once she is in her room, Melia cuts the feed. None of us say a word as we try to make sense of what we saw.

Alastor asks why he referred to Amarah as a Barbie doll, and I have no idea what answer to give him. “Maybe because she was wearing a dress,” Rhea whispers. “She looked like a porcelain doll in that dress, and I doubt he ever saw her in her usual outfits.”

We all know she is probably right. Amarah looked amazing in her dress, and anyone who didn’t know her would have thought she was a spoiled little brat. But that’s not an accurate picture of Amarah—she is the best Warrior we have and our future Alpha.

Amarah

I hear my Dad roar, and I wonder if he found out what happened. Soon he is joined by his Beta and Gamma, and I even hear my Brother roar—it sounds like they are beyond pissed. Minerva roars in my head as the tears come once more. I didn’t think I had any left, but apparently, I was wrong.

Mom walks in with my dinner on a tray, and I know she will not ask me to come downstairs to have dinner with everyone else. She tells me they know what happened and that Dad wants to inform the Pack about it, show them the footage of the video feed.

I tell her Dad is allowed to inform the Pack, but to make it clear that no one is to bring it up in my presence. Unless, of course, I bring it up myself. Our Pack will be outraged, and I know that once they have seen it, I will hear roars throughout the Pack.

It doesn’t take long before I hear the first roars, and when I hear them about an hour later, I know Dad just informed the Wolves that had been on patrol. Minerva is becoming restless again, and I know that tonight will be a repeat of last night.

She needs it as an outlet for the anger she feels toward our former Mate, just as I need to let the tears fall. I just hope that someday we will be able to put this behind us and accept our second chance Mate if we are lucky enough to find him.

It is something Minerva and I do not want to think about right now, but maybe someday we will be able to think about it without feeling heartbroken and sad. For the past three years, Minerva and I had wondered what our Mate would look like, what kind of person he would be, and if we had ever met him before.

It is uncommon for us to find our Mate on the day we turn eighteen. Usually, it takes a few years, as we don’t interact with other Packs on a daily basis, and we had always believed in a happy-ever-after.

Most Werewolves are taught that the Mate-bond is a sacred bond—a bond to be cherished—and most Werewolves wait for their fated Mate. However, there are Werewolves who believe a fated Mate is a weakness, so they choose a Mate instead.

My eyes slowly close as my body finally gives in to the exhaustion from crying my eyes out all day. His face haunts me in my sleep, his words haunt me in my sleep, and there is nothing I can do about it.



Chapter 4 Asteria


Amarah

Again, I wake up in the middle of the night and quickly make my way out of the Pack house to hand over control to Minerva, giving her the chance to deal with the pain she’s feeling. She doesn’t waste any time, crossing our border without being spotted by one of our Warriors.

It doesn’t take long for her to find a Rogue and shred him to pieces. She keeps running along our borders, and some of the Rogues flee the moment they see Minerva approaching. Those Rogues are left alone as they pose no threat to our Pack.

About an hour before sunrise, we run along our eastern border from south to north. Suddenly, Minerva stops dead in her tracks, sniffing the air as she scans her surroundings. “Blood, not a Rogue,” she tells me, and slowly makes her way toward a cluster of trees and boulders.

The scent of blood grows stronger the closer we get, and Minerva slows down even further, scanning her surroundings. Suddenly, her ears perk up as we hear soft whimpers coming from within the cluster of trees and boulders.

Minerva steps cautiously into the trees to reveal a female covered in blood, with her arms wrapped around a Pup. I ask Minerva to give me back control, and the female’s eyes widen as I stand before her. She clearly wasn’t expecting a female to show up.

“Please, don’t send us back. Please, don’t tell anyone we are here,” she whispers, her voice laced with despair. I crouch down in front of her, taking in the cuts and bruises on her body. Minerva roars in my head at the sight of her injuries.

“I won’t send you back, but I need to warn our Pack doctor. I need to know that your Wolf will be able to heal this on her own, and I need to inform my Pack so our Warriors can keep an eye on you,” I tell her gently. It takes a few minutes before she responds.

“My Wolf says she can heal this on her own as long as we don’t have to start running again. I don’t know if I want anyone else to know that I’m here. Can you give me a few days to think about it?” she asks, and I decide to give her some time to calm down and rest.

I tell her I’ll be back in a few minutes. I shift into Minerva before bolting from the cluster toward our eastern border. I quietly make my way into the Pack house to gather some supplies and food for the female and her Pup.

Once I’ve handed her everything I brought with me, I tell her my name and find out her name is Asteria, and her Pup’s name is Inti. “I’ll be back tomorrow night. Get some sleep and eat something,” I say before leaving the cluster once again.

It has been four days since the rejection and three days since Asteria showed up. Inti has come out of his shell, hugging Minerva the moment we enter the cluster, and we both enjoy those moments. Asteria finally told me what had happened to them, and I had to let Minerva out to deal with her anger.

After we talked for a while longer, she finally agreed with me on telling our Pack. It will give us the chance to keep an eye on them and maybe we will be able to find out if it’s safe for her to return home. Not that Asteria is as optimistic about that as I am.

I crash on my bed to get a few hours of sleep before informing Dad about what Minerva and I have been doing at night and about our guests hiding in the cluster. It doesn’t take me long to drift off to sleep, and for the first time since my rejection, I sleep without dreaming.

As I slowly open my eyes, I realize I slept straight through. Even though it still hurts thinking about Damien, I know that Minerva and I will survive. I walk into the bathroom to take a shower, and after that, I get dressed, ready to face the world again.

Everyone acts as if I haven’t been avoiding them for days as I walk into the dining room. After I sit down, I tell Dad that I need to talk to him with all of our leadership Wolves. Alastor sits beside me, placing his hand on my knee, giving me the calm I need as I see some females staring and whispering about me.

I stand in front of the window, looking at some Pups playing on the lawn to the left of our Pack house, and I wish I could see Inti running with them. “Dad, I know everyone is aware of what happened. I don’t want to talk about it, but I have to tell you how Minerva has been dealing with it,” I say.

Turning around, I see that everyone is waiting for me to start talking. “The Rogues that were found near our borders were Minerva’s doing. It was the only way for her to deal with everything without hurting the ones we love.” Mom wraps me in her arms, while Dad tells me he already suspected as much.

“Are you going to be okay?” Alastor asks as he hugs me, and I tell him that it will take time, but that I am already feeling better. “Dad, there’s something else we need to talk about. Did the Elders or the Council send a message about Little Crescent Pack?” I ask him, and he nods.

He hands me the message, and the more I read, the angrier Minerva becomes. 

“Amarah, what’s going on?” he asks, as everyone can feel the anger radiating from my body. I take a few deep breaths, trying to calm Minerva down.

“The contents of this message are a bunch of lies,” I respond. “Khonsu’s Brother didn’t die in a Rogue attack. Khonsu killed him and tried to forcefully mark Luna Asteria. He also tried to kill her Pup, Inti, but he failed at that as Luna Asteria protected him.

Khonsu always wanted what his Brother had, even as little Pups. When his Brother found his fated Mate, Khonsu tried to seduce Asteria, but she told her Mate about what Khonsu had tried to do, and he removed Khonsu from the Pack-house to protect his Mate.

Luna Asteria managed to escape her Pack’s territory with Inti. She kept running until she was too exhausted to continue and took shelter in the cluster of trees and boulders near our eastern border. She is fully healed now, and she and Inti are doing much better than the night I met them,” I say as I look at my Father.

We discuss the options we have, and Dad decides that I’m right. With Asteria hiding in no-man’s land, we won’t be lying if we say that she is not in our Pack’s territory. Instead of having a meeting in front of the Pack house, Dad links the entire Pack at once and explains the situation.

Everyone is ordered to keep her presence a secret, and with the Alpha command in place, I know Asteria and Inti are safe. 

I follow Dad out of his office, and I’m surprised to see that an Omega is putting clothes, toys, and other items into a bag.

“Alpha, some of our Pack members have brought supplies for Luna Asteria and Inti. Where would you like me to put them?” she asks, and I smile as Dad tells her to put them in his office. He informs me that he will accompany me tonight.

Our Head Warrior approaches me and Dad to tell us that every Warrior has volunteered to visit them at night and to bring them whatever they need. Happiness and pride fill my heart as I realize that our Pack considers them as one of our own.

That night, I visit Asteria with my Dad, and when we tell her what’s going on in our Pack, she rewards us with a smile. Inti is happy with his toys and clothes; Asteria is happy with the support she’s been given, and she tells me that for the first time since her Mate was killed, she feels calm again.

We have all fallen into a routine that works for all of us. Asteria and Inti have their day and night rhythms reversed—they sleep during the day and are awake at night. Pack members take turns teaching Inti everything he would normally learn in school and helping Asteria with whatever they can.

Khonsu is still searching for her and still sticks to his story, even though most Packs have found inconsistencies with it. The Elders are not eager to give him any information, and so far, no one has shown up on our doorstep to ask about Asteria and Inti.

We received a message from Council member Boaz, stating that Khonsu was still searching for Asteria and that they had questioned him about the events of that night. He had refused to come in, using his search for Asteria as an excuse, but the Council is not giving him much time to dodge them.

Two weeks after Damien rejected me, he informed the Elders that he had found his Mate, and that had set off a new string of sleepless nights for me, while Minerva had once again taken to hunting down Rogues and shredding them to pieces.

Dad had a video conference with the Elders and a Council member the day he found out what happened. When Damien reported finding his Mate, they called Dad to ask what I wanted to do. Dad told them to leave it as it was—that his Pack would feel the consequences one day.

Realizing I needed something to take my mind off Damien, Dad told me he was stepping down, and that gave me enough to keep me busy. 

I had been trained by Dad for years, and I knew I could handle the job, but I was nervous nonetheless.

Today is the day I will take over from my Father, and we both know that some of our allied Alphas will not agree with him. They may or may not break their alliance with us, but truth be told, I don’t care, and neither does my Father.

Alastor has been over the moon, to say the least. I don’t understand why, as I am becoming Alpha and not him. 

Alastor once told me and Dad that he was glad Dad didn’t believe only a male could take the position of Alpha. When we asked him why, he smiled and said, “I don’t have the patience to deal with crap.”

Dad and I had laughed our asses off because it’s true that Alastor lacks patience in some areas. 

Alpha Drew and Luna Jess are the first to arrive. After just one look at me, they both know that I will be taking over instead of Alastor.



Chapter 5 Long Awaited


When I took over from my Father, a lot of Alphas had been shocked.

Most High-ranking Wolves give their position to their Sons even if they have a first-born Daughter. In the history of my Pack there have been two other females that could take over the Alpha title from their Father, but both decided they didn’t want to.

I on the other hand have always known that I wanted the title when the time came and with my Father’s Beta, Gamma and Deltas also having first born Daughters all our Highest-ranking positions are filled by females.

When my Father stepped down as Alpha and when the Elders had sent out the notification to every Pack some Alphas had torn up the alliance we had with them. It didn’t bother me as it was something my Father and I had expected.

Of the nine alliances we had four that were broken when I took over, but the other five stayed loyal as each of their Alphas had seen me grow up and they knew I would be as good an Alpha as my Father had been. One of those Packs lives to the south of us and together we keep an eye on the no-mans land between our Pack territories.

That clearing is used by anyone that wants to travel from one side of our Pack territories to the other side and most of those travelers have no ill intentions, but some are Rogues that will try to get onto our Pack territory. They only get one warning, if that doesn’t scare them off, they die.

I know that not all Rogues are bad and the ones that have no ill intentions are also the ones that only need one warning, the others don’t care whether they life or die as long as they think there is something to gain. So I must always pay attention to the Rogues.

Right now, I am sitting in one of the watch spots along our border, my eyes shift left to right and back again as I keep an eye out for Rogues. 

Our eastern border patrols tightened after three Rogues crossed into our neighbor’s territory ten years ago, killing two pack members. 

I can still hear Dad’s roar that morning when Alpha Damon informed him. He gathered the Warriors on duty, but no one had seen the Rogues. After a long investigation with his Beta and Gamma, they found nothing.

I was sixteen then, and determined to help. 

I called my friends for a sleepover, and that night, we snuck out to watch the patrol ourselves. 

After an hour of observing, we saw the problem: our Warriors run the borders from north to south at the east border, and they run the borders clockwise, but as they near the south border they all take a short cut, leaving a blind spot—exactly where the Rogues crossed.

The next morning, we told Dad what we discovered. He was furious at us for sneaking out, but more so at the Warriors for endangering the pack. 

He called every Warrior not on border patrol to the Pack-house and the ones on border patrol were included through the mind-link.

“As some of you may have heard three Rogues crossed the west border of Dark Mountain Pack and killed two of their Pack-members. We couldn’t find anything wrong with our border runs and I can assure you that your Beta, your Gamma and I went over everything.

Our Pups were the ones that pointed out how they were able to cross the border without being spotted. They watched you for an hour last night and each and everyone of you takes a short cut from the eastern border to the southern border.

This will no longer be tolerated, as of right now you will run the borders the way they are and I will make sure that you will be randomly checked. Am I making myself clear?” The look on his face is murderous and the Warriors all answer with “Yes, Alpha.”

Since that day, our Warriors have patrolled diligently, but one of our older Warriors suggested we set up hidden watch points along the borders, like in his former pack. 

I proposed the idea to Dad, and after refining it with his Beta and Gamma, we implemented it. 

Now, I sit at one of those hidden spots, armed with my bow and arrows, ensuring no Rogue crosses our borders again.

I see movement across the clearing and know it’s one of their Warriors on border patrol. I still haven’t figured out how they conduct their patrols, and truth be told, I don’t really care. But I do wonder if they’re aware of the fact that we have stopped dozens of Rogues since that night.

“Alpha, you have a visitor,” I hear my Beta say through the mind-link. I tell the Warriors with me that I’m heading back to the Pack house for some Pack business. They both nod but don’t take their eyes off the clearing.

Before heading to the Pack house, I step out of the tree line and look in the direction of a small cluster of trees and boulders. I know who lives there, and so does every Warrior in my Pack, but we don’t mention it to outsiders as it might put her life at risk.

I know who my visitor is, but I don’t know why he’s here. I’ve been thinking about his reason for showing up ever since he announced his visit. No answer has come to mind, but I guess I’ll find out soon enough why he’s gracing me with a visit.

As I walk back to the Pack house, I pass many of my Pack members. Like my Father, I greet each and every one of them as I pass. 

I smile at the antics of a little Pup and grab a hold of him just before he tumbles down. 

“Thank you, Alpha,” the little Pup says before I put him back on his feet.

One of my Deltas joins me as I near the back of the Pack house, and the two of us make our way to my official office on the ground floor. 

I ask an Omega we pass if she can bring us some coffee, and she rushes off to the kitchen to comply with my request.

As I walk into my office, my visitor gets up from his seat. 

“Elder Ezra, please take a seat,” I say, and he sits back down in the chair he just got out of as I take a seat behind my desk. 

“To what do we owe this pleasure, Elder?” I ask.

Elder Ezra pulls an envelope from his bag and puts it on my desk in front of me. I stare at the envelope for a moment. I know what’s in it just by looking at it, and I have to suppress the smile that wants to spread across my face.

I have only seen it once before, lying on this same desk over a decade ago when my Father was still the Alpha. 

I have been waiting for this day ever since I took over from my Father, and I know I will enjoy this very much, as will my Wolf.

“Alpha, in the file you’ll find a list of the Packs that have been invited as well. All the rules, regulations, and conditions are in there, along with my number, just in case you still have unanswered questions,” he says as he gets out of his seat.

“Thank you, Elder Ezra. I will read it all and contact you if something is unclear to me,” I say as I shake his hand. I guide him out of the Pack house to his car and watch him drive off. 

A smirk appears on my face as soon as he is out of sight.

“That’s about damn time,” my Gamma mumbles, and we all start laughing. 

We walk back to my office, and as we’re about to enter, one of the Omegas walks out, telling me she has placed the coffee in my office as she heads back to the kitchen.

I sit down in my favorite armchair facing my desk, while my Beta, Gamma, and Deltas sit on the couches to my left and right. The five of us grew up together—if you saw one of us, the rest were soon to follow, making it easy for our parents to find us.

I open the envelope, already knowing what’s inside: an invitation to the Alpha bloodline competition. 

The smirk on my face gets bigger as I pull it out. I have been waiting a long time for this moment, and I will enjoy putting all those cocky Alphas and their siblings in their place.

The Alpha bloodline competition is held every year for a select few Packs. They get invited by the Elders and get to beat the crap out of each other legally. Every person from an Alpha bloodline in that Pack is allowed to enter the competition.

The Council doesn’t interfere with this competition, even though they love the fights between the Alphas, and some of them even come to see the invited Alphas fight. Our King has never shown his face at the competition, and Dad doubts he ever will.

I read through all the rules and regulations for the competition. The more I read, the bigger the smile on my face becomes, and I know everyone present in my office can tell that I’ve found a way for the participants to underestimate me.

The rules state that the first name drawn gets the choice to fully shift into Wolf form or go Half-shift. But there’s a loophole—the opponent doesn’t have to follow. They just can’t shift fully if the first fighter chooses Half. 

I’ll use that to my advantage. Let them think they know what I’m capable of.

Chapter 1 Rejected


Amarah

My name is Amarah Raven, I am a twenty one year old Werewolf and the future Alpha of White Crescent Pack. Yes, you read that correctly I am the future Alpha and our Pack is the largest and strongest Pack there is.

Hearing the Omegas talk about my parents has me stopping dead in my tracks, my parents have been ruling our Pack for almost forty years and they don’t want to celebrate. 

“Alastor, where are you?” I ask my baby Brother through our mind-link and as I rush up the stairs I link my best friends.

“Did you know Mom and Dad have been ruling for almost forty years?” I ask him as I open the door to Alastor’s room and his eyes fly open as he mutters “Fuck” before he sits up straight. 

I link one of the Omegas to have breakfast delivered to my office for all of us and as soon as we are all sitting, Alastor and I tell them what the reason for our meeting is. We know we need a lot of help organizing this and I tell each of them what I expect them to do.

We are able to get every Pack-member to help in one way or another, from decorations to color scheme and we manage to do it without our parents finding out. I am even able to enlist the help of Luna Jess of Silver Moon Pack, she will take care of inviting some of our Allies.

In a matter of three weeks we have to get everything organized and on the day of the party, Alastor and I will take our parents out to dinner. 

I am even wearing a dress to humor Mom, everyone knows that I don’t like to wear a dress and if I can avoid it for the rest of my life I will. 

It is an emerald green, floor length, one shoulder dress with a split starting mid-thigh on the left. Three string of shiny stones run from my right shoulder down my back to just above my ass and I top it off with black velvet high heeled ankle boots. 

The Friday of the party comes as it always does and after lunch Mom and I go upstairs to get our hair and make-up done, after which we get into our dresses and Mom looks gorgeous in her royal blue, floor length dress.

Blue and gold is the color scheme, just as it was at their Alpha and Luna Ceremony and when I see Dad I am stunned. He is wearing a black three pieced suit with a royal blue button-up shirt and so is Alastor. 

“I had a small surprise made for you,” Alastor says as he pulls out two black mask. “Would you mind putting these on?” he asks and Mom and Dad take them without hesitation. We both grab hold of an arm and lead them through the Pack-house to the backdoor.

Melia and Rhea are waiting for us at the back porch and they take up position behind Mom and Dad, they pull away the masks at the same time. Mom and Dad look stunned at the scene in front of them and I see tears form in Mom’s eyes, looks like we did an excellent job.

Eos signals the DJ to start the music and soon Mom and Dad are off to mingle with their guests, laughing and smiling they walk around. Alastor and I watch from a distance with smiles on our faces.

After an hour I get on to a small stage and everyone quiets down, “Thank you all so much for coming. My Mom and Dad stood here forty years ago to swear to each of you that they would be your Alpha and Luna until the day they would step down.” I start the speech I prepared for tonight.

Everyone is having an amazing time and I talk to every Alpha and Luna that is present. I dance with Gammas and Betas and even with some of our own Warriors, really enjoying myself despite wearing a dress.

It is a little after midnight when I decide to get changed into something a bit more within my comfort zone and as I walk in through the back door I get hit by an intoxicating scent, a scent I smelled a few times during the evening.

I had not been able to locate the scent with all those Wolves around, because it came and quickly went away every time. This time I sniff the air and I know that however the scent belongs to is inside the Pack-house, I slowly walk further into the hallway.

With every step I take the scent becomes stronger and Minerva, my Wolf, is jumping up and down in my head, making me giggle at her. I am at the bottom of the stairs when I realize that the scent is coming from upstairs and I get an inkling feeling.

Minerva is now pacing in my head and like me she doesn’t like where this is leading us. As I reach the first floor Minerva whispers “Mate” and I start walking towards the guest rooms on this floor, but I know that we don’t have anyone spending the night here.

Suddenly a noise stops me dead in my tracks and Minerva and I are on high alert, being an Alpha’s Daughter makes me react faster than most. I turn around to see if there is someone behind me and when I am satisfied I am alone in the hallway I turn back around.

After taking two more steps I am on high alert again, but this time I know the sound is coming from somewhere in front of me and tentatively I take another step. Slowly but steadily I get closer to the scent and slowly a smile appears on my face, I believe Minerva is right.

Minerva is getting more agitated the closer we get to the scent, but she can’t explain to me why and I decide to ignore her for the time being. Following the scent has lead me to the last room on my right and as I put my hand on the doorknob I hear someone groan.

Not knowing what might be behind the door I quietly turn the doorknob and I start pushing the door open slowly and quietly. My eyes widen at the scene in front of me and Minerva is roaring in my head.

A male is standing at the foot of the bed and in front of him is a woman on all fours, they are so engrossed with one and other that they don’t even notice me. The male slowly turns his head towards me as he keeps pounding into the female, he has a smirk on his face and I realize that even the female is looking at me now.

“I, Damien of Dark Mountain Pack, reject you as my Mate. I don’t need a barbie doll.” The male says and I hear Minerva whimper in my head, I know he is our mate but he really doesn’t want us. 

“I, Amarah of White Cresent Pack, reject you as my Mate.” I reply and the Male crashes to the floor in pain.



Chapter 2 Find Out


Amarah

I don’t remember how I got up the stairs or how I got to my room. I don’t remember getting out of my dress or into the bathroom, and I don’t remember getting into the shower.

But that’s where my Mother found me early in the morning, still silently crying at the loss of my Mate.

Minerva has been quiet ever since I walked away from our Mate. I tell her that I understand she is hurting, and that I don’t have the words to comfort her, but that I am here whenever she needs me. For the first time today, I feel her presence, and I feel a little relieved at that.

Alpha Atlas

My Mate and I are enjoying the party our Pups organized for us behind our backs. They did an excellent job, enlisting the help of everyone willing to assist. Amarah even got Luna Jess to help her with the invitations, and I think I’ve thanked her for that four times already.

My Mate was surprised to see they used the color scheme from forty years ago. But when Melia told us her Mom had helped them with that, it explained everything. Amarah is wearing a dress for once, and she looks absolutely stunning.

Amarah never was a girl to wear dresses, and from the moment she was able to make that known to us, we had a battle every time my Mate tried to get her to wear one. This is the third time I’m seeing my Daughter in a dress, and I know she’ll never wear one again if it’s up to her.

It’s nearly morning when we finally decide to call it a night. Most of the guests that weren’t from our Pack left around one in the morning, and now there are only a handful of Pack members left in the backyard.

My Mate tells me she’ll check on our Pups before joining me in our room. I smile at her as I nod my head; no matter how old they get, she will still check on them before turning in herself. I get out of my suit and go through my evening routine when I suddenly feel my Mate’s distress.

I rush out of our room in a pair of shorts, and I hear her softly talking to Amarah, but I can’t make out what they are saying. She must have felt my presence as she links me and tells me to go to bed and wait for her.

Ten minutes later, my Mate walks in with a sad expression on her face. She tells me what she found when she went to check on Amarah, and I ask her if she told her what had happened. My Mate says she didn’t, but she hadn’t seen any injuries on her.

Amarah spends the day in her room, and I call her friends to my office, hoping to find out more, but they don’t have any answers for me either. Ione asks if they can investigate this on their own, and she’ll inform me once they’ve found something.

Something happened to my Daughter, and I intend to find out what it is and who is responsible. I will make whoever hurt my little girl pay for what they did, and they will regret it. My Wolf is roaring in my head at whoever did this to her.

Amarah stays in her room during dinner, something she has never done before, and everyone is talking about it.

Alastor tells them that something happened during the party, but that Amarah has not told anyone anything yet. He hopes that whoever knows anything will come forward.

No one seems to know anything about what might have happened, and Ione hasn’t come to me yet, indicating they haven’t found anything either. Knowing my Pack members, everyone will try to help find the answers I need.

My Mate and I have a restless night as we keep worrying about our Daughter. In the early morning hours, roars and growls make both of us jump out of bed. I link my Gamma to find out what is going on.

He tells me he was woken up by a mind-link, only stating to come to the borders.

Amarah

I wake up in the middle of the night to a very agitated Minerva, and she tells me we need to go for a run. I quietly make my way down the stairs as everyone else is fast asleep, and as soon as I walk out the back door, Minerva takes over, making a run for the border.

She crosses the border without slowing down, sniffing the air in search of rogues, and I hope that she will be able to get rid of some of the pent-up anger raging through her.

It doesn’t take her long to find a rogue roaming near our northern border. She toys with him for a while before tearing him to pieces, leaving his body close to the border. She takes another sniff of the air before taking off running again.

After a few hours, she has killed six rogues, and I can tell that she has calmed down a little, but I know it will take a few more nights like this before she comes to terms with what Damien did. We rush back towards the border, and again she doesn’t slow down as we cross the border.

Roars and howls wake me a few hours later, and I know our Warriors have found the rogues Minerva took out during the night. I hear footsteps running around the Pack house and softer rushed footsteps inside, indicating that everyone was woken up.

I decide to get dressed and go see Dad to tell him Minerva took out those rogues, but Minerva shows me the scene with Damien again. I know she needs this to get it out of her system, and Dad will order us to stay within the borders as soon as he finds out it was Minerva.

Deciding not to tell Dad, I fall back on my bed again, Damien’s rejection running through my mind once more, and the tears start flowing again. The day repeats itself, spending my time in bed and crying for the loss of my Mate. Minerva and I both don’t understand why, and I guess we’ll never find out the answer to that question.

He said he didn’t want a Barbie doll, but how could he say that, seeing we never met before? Anyone that knows me will tell you I am anything but a Barbie doll. No, I think he used that as an excuse to reject me, and if I ever meet him again, I will make him regret this.

I ignore the knocks on my door, and I ignore the pushes against my barrier on the mind-link. Only Mom opens my door after I don’t respond to her knocking. Just like yesterday, she makes sure my food is brought up to my room, and just like yesterday, I don’t leave my room.



Chapter 3 Answers


Ione

After hearing from Alpha Atlas that something had happened to Amarah, we went to her office to find some answers. So far, all we know is that she left the party before most of the guests, but after that, no one seems to know where she went.

None of us got much sleep, as we were worried about our best friend. This morning, before heading to Amarah’s office, I asked Dad if he had any idea where to look next. He told me to use the security cameras to see where she went after leaving the party.

As Melia and I eat breakfast, we watch the security footage outside to see where she went. To our surprise, she walks into the Pack house, telling us that whatever happened, it happened inside.

I know that our security cameras record both image and sound—something Dad told me is useful if you can’t see someone’s face. I hoped this would explain what happened in the Pack house better than just watching the footage.

Rhea and Eos walk into the office as I search for the footage from inside the Pack house. Once I find it, I put it on the big screen so we can all see it at the same time. We see her enter through the backdoor, and it takes us only a second to realize that she found her Mate.

Instead of saying or asking anything, we watch the screen as it unfolds the most horrifying thing I have ever seen. I think I would rather watch a massacre over and over again than ever see this again. As I look at my friends, I know I am not the only one.

It took us hours to find all the footage from inside the Pack house. Now that we have finally found the answer to our question, my Wolf wants to kill someone. It is close to dinnertime, and I know I have to let Alpha Atlas know what we found—something I am not looking forward to.

“Alpha, could you come to Amarah’s office and bring everyone with you?” I tell him through the mind-link. Within seconds, all our parents, Amarah’s parents, and her Brother walk in. I tell my Dad I followed his advice and found out what happened during the night of the party.

Melia starts the video feed, and like us, they quickly realize what must have happened. But Melia stops the feed before we get to the point where her life changed for good. “I don’t know….” I start, but I am not sure how to say what I want to say. Eos is the one to help me out.

“Alpha Atlas, I would rather spend twenty-four hours reading through our history than ever see this again,” Eos says. Alastor pales, as we all know how much she hated it when we went to school.

Alpha Atlas tells Melia to start the feed again, and we all watch as she walks down the hallway toward the soft sounds. Eos walks toward the window as the feed jumps to another camera in the hallway. As we see Amarah slowly open the door, I hear Alpha Atlas growl, which only gets louder the more he sees.

Our Mothers have tears running down their cheeks as they hear the words spoken by the male. Alastor yells, “I am going to kill you, Damien,” before he even mentions his name, and I wonder how he knew who the male was, as I didn’t.

Our Fathers are growling and roaring, while our Mothers are heartbroken. We keep watching as Amarah slowly makes her way up to her room, staggering up the stairs. Once she is in her room, Melia cuts the feed. None of us say a word as we try to make sense of what we saw.

Alastor asks why he referred to Amarah as a Barbie doll, and I have no idea what answer to give him. “Maybe because she was wearing a dress,” Rhea whispers. “She looked like a porcelain doll in that dress, and I doubt he ever saw her in her usual outfits.”

We all know she is probably right. Amarah looked amazing in her dress, and anyone who didn’t know her would have thought she was a spoiled little brat. But that’s not an accurate picture of Amarah—she is the best Warrior we have and our future Alpha.

Amarah

I hear my Dad roar, and I wonder if he found out what happened. Soon he is joined by his Beta and Gamma, and I even hear my Brother roar—it sounds like they are beyond pissed. Minerva roars in my head as the tears come once more. I didn’t think I had any left, but apparently, I was wrong.

Mom walks in with my dinner on a tray, and I know she will not ask me to come downstairs to have dinner with everyone else. She tells me they know what happened and that Dad wants to inform the Pack about it, show them the footage of the video feed.

I tell her Dad is allowed to inform the Pack, but to make it clear that no one is to bring it up in my presence. Unless, of course, I bring it up myself. Our Pack will be outraged, and I know that once they have seen it, I will hear roars throughout the Pack.

It doesn’t take long before I hear the first roars, and when I hear them about an hour later, I know Dad just informed the Wolves that had been on patrol. Minerva is becoming restless again, and I know that tonight will be a repeat of last night.

She needs it as an outlet for the anger she feels toward our former Mate, just as I need to let the tears fall. I just hope that someday we will be able to put this behind us and accept our second chance Mate if we are lucky enough to find him.

It is something Minerva and I do not want to think about right now, but maybe someday we will be able to think about it without feeling heartbroken and sad. For the past three years, Minerva and I had wondered what our Mate would look like, what kind of person he would be, and if we had ever met him before.

It is uncommon for us to find our Mate on the day we turn eighteen. Usually, it takes a few years, as we don’t interact with other Packs on a daily basis, and we had always believed in a happy-ever-after.

Most Werewolves are taught that the Mate-bond is a sacred bond—a bond to be cherished—and most Werewolves wait for their fated Mate. However, there are Werewolves who believe a fated Mate is a weakness, so they choose a Mate instead.

My eyes slowly close as my body finally gives in to the exhaustion from crying my eyes out all day. His face haunts me in my sleep, his words haunt me in my sleep, and there is nothing I can do about it.



Chapter 4 Asteria


Amarah

Again, I wake up in the middle of the night and quickly make my way out of the Pack house to hand over control to Minerva, giving her the chance to deal with the pain she’s feeling. She doesn’t waste any time, crossing our border without being spotted by one of our Warriors.

It doesn’t take long for her to find a Rogue and shred him to pieces. She keeps running along our borders, and some of the Rogues flee the moment they see Minerva approaching. Those Rogues are left alone as they pose no threat to our Pack.

About an hour before sunrise, we run along our eastern border from south to north. Suddenly, Minerva stops dead in her tracks, sniffing the air as she scans her surroundings. “Blood, not a Rogue,” she tells me, and slowly makes her way toward a cluster of trees and boulders.

The scent of blood grows stronger the closer we get, and Minerva slows down even further, scanning her surroundings. Suddenly, her ears perk up as we hear soft whimpers coming from within the cluster of trees and boulders.

Minerva steps cautiously into the trees to reveal a female covered in blood, with her arms wrapped around a Pup. I ask Minerva to give me back control, and the female’s eyes widen as I stand before her. She clearly wasn’t expecting a female to show up.

“Please, don’t send us back. Please, don’t tell anyone we are here,” she whispers, her voice laced with despair. I crouch down in front of her, taking in the cuts and bruises on her body. Minerva roars in my head at the sight of her injuries.

“I won’t send you back, but I need to warn our Pack doctor. I need to know that your Wolf will be able to heal this on her own, and I need to inform my Pack so our Warriors can keep an eye on you,” I tell her gently. It takes a few minutes before she responds.

“My Wolf says she can heal this on her own as long as we don’t have to start running again. I don’t know if I want anyone else to know that I’m here. Can you give me a few days to think about it?” she asks, and I decide to give her some time to calm down and rest.

I tell her I’ll be back in a few minutes. I shift into Minerva before bolting from the cluster toward our eastern border. I quietly make my way into the Pack house to gather some supplies and food for the female and her Pup.

Once I’ve handed her everything I brought with me, I tell her my name and find out her name is Asteria, and her Pup’s name is Inti. “I’ll be back tomorrow night. Get some sleep and eat something,” I say before leaving the cluster once again.

It has been four days since the rejection and three days since Asteria showed up. Inti has come out of his shell, hugging Minerva the moment we enter the cluster, and we both enjoy those moments. Asteria finally told me what had happened to them, and I had to let Minerva out to deal with her anger.

After we talked for a while longer, she finally agreed with me on telling our Pack. It will give us the chance to keep an eye on them and maybe we will be able to find out if it’s safe for her to return home. Not that Asteria is as optimistic about that as I am.

I crash on my bed to get a few hours of sleep before informing Dad about what Minerva and I have been doing at night and about our guests hiding in the cluster. It doesn’t take me long to drift off to sleep, and for the first time since my rejection, I sleep without dreaming.

As I slowly open my eyes, I realize I slept straight through. Even though it still hurts thinking about Damien, I know that Minerva and I will survive. I walk into the bathroom to take a shower, and after that, I get dressed, ready to face the world again.

Everyone acts as if I haven’t been avoiding them for days as I walk into the dining room. After I sit down, I tell Dad that I need to talk to him with all of our leadership Wolves. Alastor sits beside me, placing his hand on my knee, giving me the calm I need as I see some females staring and whispering about me.

I stand in front of the window, looking at some Pups playing on the lawn to the left of our Pack house, and I wish I could see Inti running with them. “Dad, I know everyone is aware of what happened. I don’t want to talk about it, but I have to tell you how Minerva has been dealing with it,” I say.

Turning around, I see that everyone is waiting for me to start talking. “The Rogues that were found near our borders were Minerva’s doing. It was the only way for her to deal with everything without hurting the ones we love.” Mom wraps me in her arms, while Dad tells me he already suspected as much.

“Are you going to be okay?” Alastor asks as he hugs me, and I tell him that it will take time, but that I am already feeling better. “Dad, there’s something else we need to talk about. Did the Elders or the Council send a message about Little Crescent Pack?” I ask him, and he nods.

He hands me the message, and the more I read, the angrier Minerva becomes. 

“Amarah, what’s going on?” he asks, as everyone can feel the anger radiating from my body. I take a few deep breaths, trying to calm Minerva down.

“The contents of this message are a bunch of lies,” I respond. “Khonsu’s Brother didn’t die in a Rogue attack. Khonsu killed him and tried to forcefully mark Luna Asteria. He also tried to kill her Pup, Inti, but he failed at that as Luna Asteria protected him.

Khonsu always wanted what his Brother had, even as little Pups. When his Brother found his fated Mate, Khonsu tried to seduce Asteria, but she told her Mate about what Khonsu had tried to do, and he removed Khonsu from the Pack-house to protect his Mate.

Luna Asteria managed to escape her Pack’s territory with Inti. She kept running until she was too exhausted to continue and took shelter in the cluster of trees and boulders near our eastern border. She is fully healed now, and she and Inti are doing much better than the night I met them,” I say as I look at my Father.

We discuss the options we have, and Dad decides that I’m right. With Asteria hiding in no-man’s land, we won’t be lying if we say that she is not in our Pack’s territory. Instead of having a meeting in front of the Pack house, Dad links the entire Pack at once and explains the situation.

Everyone is ordered to keep her presence a secret, and with the Alpha command in place, I know Asteria and Inti are safe. 

I follow Dad out of his office, and I’m surprised to see that an Omega is putting clothes, toys, and other items into a bag.

“Alpha, some of our Pack members have brought supplies for Luna Asteria and Inti. Where would you like me to put them?” she asks, and I smile as Dad tells her to put them in his office. He informs me that he will accompany me tonight.

Our Head Warrior approaches me and Dad to tell us that every Warrior has volunteered to visit them at night and to bring them whatever they need. Happiness and pride fill my heart as I realize that our Pack considers them as one of our own.

That night, I visit Asteria with my Dad, and when we tell her what’s going on in our Pack, she rewards us with a smile. Inti is happy with his toys and clothes; Asteria is happy with the support she’s been given, and she tells me that for the first time since her Mate was killed, she feels calm again.

We have all fallen into a routine that works for all of us. Asteria and Inti have their day and night rhythms reversed—they sleep during the day and are awake at night. Pack members take turns teaching Inti everything he would normally learn in school and helping Asteria with whatever they can.

Khonsu is still searching for her and still sticks to his story, even though most Packs have found inconsistencies with it. The Elders are not eager to give him any information, and so far, no one has shown up on our doorstep to ask about Asteria and Inti.

We received a message from Council member Boaz, stating that Khonsu was still searching for Asteria and that they had questioned him about the events of that night. He had refused to come in, using his search for Asteria as an excuse, but the Council is not giving him much time to dodge them.

Two weeks after Damien rejected me, he informed the Elders that he had found his Mate, and that had set off a new string of sleepless nights for me, while Minerva had once again taken to hunting down Rogues and shredding them to pieces.

Dad had a video conference with the Elders and a Council member the day he found out what happened. When Damien reported finding his Mate, they called Dad to ask what I wanted to do. Dad told them to leave it as it was—that his Pack would feel the consequences one day.

Realizing I needed something to take my mind off Damien, Dad told me he was stepping down, and that gave me enough to keep me busy. 

I had been trained by Dad for years, and I knew I could handle the job, but I was nervous nonetheless.

Today is the day I will take over from my Father, and we both know that some of our allied Alphas will not agree with him. They may or may not break their alliance with us, but truth be told, I don’t care, and neither does my Father.

Alastor has been over the moon, to say the least. I don’t understand why, as I am becoming Alpha and not him. 

Alastor once told me and Dad that he was glad Dad didn’t believe only a male could take the position of Alpha. When we asked him why, he smiled and said, “I don’t have the patience to deal with crap.”

Dad and I had laughed our asses off because it’s true that Alastor lacks patience in some areas. 

Alpha Drew and Luna Jess are the first to arrive. After just one look at me, they both know that I will be taking over instead of Alastor.



Chapter 5 Long Awaited


When I took over from my Father, a lot of Alphas had been shocked.

Most High-ranking Wolves give their position to their Sons even if they have a first-born Daughter. In the history of my Pack there have been two other females that could take over the Alpha title from their Father, but both decided they didn’t want to.

I on the other hand have always known that I wanted the title when the time came and with my Father’s Beta, Gamma and Deltas also having first born Daughters all our Highest-ranking positions are filled by females.

When my Father stepped down as Alpha and when the Elders had sent out the notification to every Pack some Alphas had torn up the alliance we had with them. It didn’t bother me as it was something my Father and I had expected.

Of the nine alliances we had four that were broken when I took over, but the other five stayed loyal as each of their Alphas had seen me grow up and they knew I would be as good an Alpha as my Father had been. One of those Packs lives to the south of us and together we keep an eye on the no-mans land between our Pack territories.

That clearing is used by anyone that wants to travel from one side of our Pack territories to the other side and most of those travelers have no ill intentions, but some are Rogues that will try to get onto our Pack territory. They only get one warning, if that doesn’t scare them off, they die.

I know that not all Rogues are bad and the ones that have no ill intentions are also the ones that only need one warning, the others don’t care whether they life or die as long as they think there is something to gain. So I must always pay attention to the Rogues.

Right now, I am sitting in one of the watch spots along our border, my eyes shift left to right and back again as I keep an eye out for Rogues. 

Our eastern border patrols tightened after three Rogues crossed into our neighbor’s territory ten years ago, killing two pack members. 

I can still hear Dad’s roar that morning when Alpha Damon informed him. He gathered the Warriors on duty, but no one had seen the Rogues. After a long investigation with his Beta and Gamma, they found nothing.

I was sixteen then, and determined to help. 

I called my friends for a sleepover, and that night, we snuck out to watch the patrol ourselves. 

After an hour of observing, we saw the problem: our Warriors run the borders from north to south at the east border, and they run the borders clockwise, but as they near the south border they all take a short cut, leaving a blind spot—exactly where the Rogues crossed.

The next morning, we told Dad what we discovered. He was furious at us for sneaking out, but more so at the Warriors for endangering the pack. 

He called every Warrior not on border patrol to the Pack-house and the ones on border patrol were included through the mind-link.

“As some of you may have heard three Rogues crossed the west border of Dark Mountain Pack and killed two of their Pack-members. We couldn’t find anything wrong with our border runs and I can assure you that your Beta, your Gamma and I went over everything.

Our Pups were the ones that pointed out how they were able to cross the border without being spotted. They watched you for an hour last night and each and everyone of you takes a short cut from the eastern border to the southern border.

This will no longer be tolerated, as of right now you will run the borders the way they are and I will make sure that you will be randomly checked. Am I making myself clear?” The look on his face is murderous and the Warriors all answer with “Yes, Alpha.”

Since that day, our Warriors have patrolled diligently, but one of our older Warriors suggested we set up hidden watch points along the borders, like in his former pack. 

I proposed the idea to Dad, and after refining it with his Beta and Gamma, we implemented it. 

Now, I sit at one of those hidden spots, armed with my bow and arrows, ensuring no Rogue crosses our borders again.

I see movement across the clearing and know it’s one of their Warriors on border patrol. I still haven’t figured out how they conduct their patrols, and truth be told, I don’t really care. But I do wonder if they’re aware of the fact that we have stopped dozens of Rogues since that night.

“Alpha, you have a visitor,” I hear my Beta say through the mind-link. I tell the Warriors with me that I’m heading back to the Pack house for some Pack business. They both nod but don’t take their eyes off the clearing.

Before heading to the Pack house, I step out of the tree line and look in the direction of a small cluster of trees and boulders. I know who lives there, and so does every Warrior in my Pack, but we don’t mention it to outsiders as it might put her life at risk.

I know who my visitor is, but I don’t know why he’s here. I’ve been thinking about his reason for showing up ever since he announced his visit. No answer has come to mind, but I guess I’ll find out soon enough why he’s gracing me with a visit.

As I walk back to the Pack house, I pass many of my Pack members. Like my Father, I greet each and every one of them as I pass. 

I smile at the antics of a little Pup and grab a hold of him just before he tumbles down. 

“Thank you, Alpha,” the little Pup says before I put him back on his feet.

One of my Deltas joins me as I near the back of the Pack house, and the two of us make our way to my official office on the ground floor. 

I ask an Omega we pass if she can bring us some coffee, and she rushes off to the kitchen to comply with my request.

As I walk into my office, my visitor gets up from his seat. 

“Elder Ezra, please take a seat,” I say, and he sits back down in the chair he just got out of as I take a seat behind my desk. 

“To what do we owe this pleasure, Elder?” I ask.

Elder Ezra pulls an envelope from his bag and puts it on my desk in front of me. I stare at the envelope for a moment. I know what’s in it just by looking at it, and I have to suppress the smile that wants to spread across my face.

I have only seen it once before, lying on this same desk over a decade ago when my Father was still the Alpha. 

I have been waiting for this day ever since I took over from my Father, and I know I will enjoy this very much, as will my Wolf.

“Alpha, in the file you’ll find a list of the Packs that have been invited as well. All the rules, regulations, and conditions are in there, along with my number, just in case you still have unanswered questions,” he says as he gets out of his seat.

“Thank you, Elder Ezra. I will read it all and contact you if something is unclear to me,” I say as I shake his hand. I guide him out of the Pack house to his car and watch him drive off. 

A smirk appears on my face as soon as he is out of sight.

“That’s about damn time,” my Gamma mumbles, and we all start laughing. 

We walk back to my office, and as we’re about to enter, one of the Omegas walks out, telling me she has placed the coffee in my office as she heads back to the kitchen.

I sit down in my favorite armchair facing my desk, while my Beta, Gamma, and Deltas sit on the couches to my left and right. The five of us grew up together—if you saw one of us, the rest were soon to follow, making it easy for our parents to find us.

I open the envelope, already knowing what’s inside: an invitation to the Alpha bloodline competition. 

The smirk on my face gets bigger as I pull it out. I have been waiting a long time for this moment, and I will enjoy putting all those cocky Alphas and their siblings in their place.

The Alpha bloodline competition is held every year for a select few Packs. They get invited by the Elders and get to beat the crap out of each other legally. Every person from an Alpha bloodline in that Pack is allowed to enter the competition.

The Council doesn’t interfere with this competition, even though they love the fights between the Alphas, and some of them even come to see the invited Alphas fight. Our King has never shown his face at the competition, and Dad doubts he ever will.

I read through all the rules and regulations for the competition. The more I read, the bigger the smile on my face becomes, and I know everyone present in my office can tell that I’ve found a way for the participants to underestimate me.

The rules state that the first name drawn gets the choice to fully shift into Wolf form or go Half-shift. But there’s a loophole—the opponent doesn’t have to follow. They just can’t shift fully if the first fighter chooses Half. 

I’ll use that to my advantage. Let them think they know what I’m capable of.

1hmme80,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/1hmme80/my_wife_hates_notes/,"My wife hates ""notes"".","My wife and I have been fighting this past week and it's far worse then ever before.  We're in our mid 40's and been together 11 years.   On a side note, I'm on the spectrum and had no idea until a few years ago.   I just thought I was weird.  We both have traumatic pasts and a whole lot of baggage.   We have an 8 year old daughter who is also on the spectrum but ""more"" if that makes sense.  She's a lot less verbal and has more issues with social interaction then I did and that's even with a proper diagnosis and all that.    She's a two person job at most times and that makes this whole situation more complicated then ""oh you're incompatible just break up."" 

Last night we were able to get down to what I *believe* is the root of the issue.

She hates ""notes"" - as in **any form** of criticism.   Over the years she has periods where she became very cold, distant and unaffectionate but never told me why until now - it's because I gave her a note or notes.   

Here's a recent example.  I *really* like it when she touches me.  If she rubs the top of my head/scalp for a moment in the morning, it makes my entire day better.   So I told her about this and asked her if she could take 10-15 seconds in the each morning as she walks right past where I sit and just rub my head for a moment.   She agreed to this and did it and it was great.  But then it went from once a day to every other, to every third and when I mentioned it she stopped doing it altogether.   

If she does something I like and I express that really like something that she did and would like more of whatever that is - she is likely to interpret that as ""oh, so I've been failing by not doing that all this time"" so even what I would consider positive reinforcement or praise comes across as like, reverse criticism to her.

I've brought up that I'm frustrated by this because I can't seem to communicate any of my needs, wants, desires, preferences to her without it being interpreted as an attack, a criticism or basically put, a ""note"".  

Meanwhile, she doesn't have any problem asking me to do things or giving me notes.  I don't mind notes, it makes it easier for me to ensure that when I'm doing things for her, it's the way she likes it.   I often ask for them.   

For example, she fell and hurt her back/ass bone last summer and it's caused some pain in her legs.  I've given her a leg + foot rub with pedicure almost **every, single, day,** of the last 6 months.  These last anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour.   I sand down any rough spots, use high quality massage oil and include pain relieving cream if she's particularly sore.    If she has any particular requests or ""notes"" on how she wants the massage I do it.   no problem.  

Once she told me that all those times that she was withholding her affection was because of the notes, I felt hurt and betrayed by that, like she was punishing me. Also that she lied about it.  When I'd bring it up in the past she'd give me different reasons for why she was acting like that, ie: tired from work or stressed out etc. instead of telling me the truth that it was because of something I did or said.  

She disagrees with my assessment, saying it's normal to not want to be affectionate or do nice things for someone you are upset with.    

I pointed out that the times that I have done that to her, she called it childish, immature and asshole behavior.   For example, I normally get up before her, make us both coffee and bring her coffee to her in bed.   A few times when I was upset with her about something I didn't bring it her.     When asked, I also told her the truth about why I didn't bring her the coffee, because I was upset with her and didn't want to - but after she told me that she felt it was asshole behavior to do that, I agreed and stopped that.    

Any advice on how to approach this?   She doesn't seem interested in therapy - she is trained as a therapist herself and wouldn't take any therapist that didn't have a phd and 30+ years experience seriously.      

I have grown tired of being expected to meet her needs, expectations but unable to ask that any of my needs be met or be met the way I would like.   

We have other issues too but this seems to be the primary issue preventing us from moving forward.

As of now the only way I can envision resolving this is simply by never asking her for anything and seeing how that goes.   

I am very much in love with this woman and completely devoted to her.

The inverter itself is well-designed and compact, making it easy to install and find a suitable location for it in my RV.

One of the standout features of this Redodo Pure Sine Wave Inverter 1000W is the included monitoring screen. This screen provides real-time information on the inverter's status, including input voltage, output voltage, and current draw. This is incredibly helpful for troubleshooting any potential issues and ensuring that my appliances are receiving the proper power. The monitoring screen also allows me to easily adjust the inverter's settings, such as the low-voltage cutoff, to optimize its performance for my specific needs. I also appreciate the fact that the Redodo Pure Sine Wave Inverter 1000W is compatible with a variety of renewable energy sources, including solar panels. This makes it a versatile option for those who are looking to build a sustainable off-grid power system.



Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Redodo Pure Sine Wave Inverter 1000W. It has exceeded my expectations in terms of both performance and reliability. I highly recommend this inverter to anyone who is in the market for a high-quality and affordable power solution.

Its very early days, and i'm happy to do the full titration, but already I suspect that this isn't the med for me

It seems split down the middle which meds 'work' for people. Even amonst us adhd ppl. (and seemingly the same drugs would effect ppl without adhd differently again)

I wonder if there's a pattern and/or clues about which meds would 'fit' us the best based on other clues

In my younger years I took cocaine on occasions. It would make my friends bounce off the wall whereas with me, I felt it made me very 'inward' thinking. Laughing became hard and almost felt forced! Maybe a mild general increase in anxiety? But my friends seemed to experience a massive CONFIDENCE increase. Something I would have loved! 

Anyway, since starting methyphenidate, i've unfortunately felt similar side effects, albeit too a lesser extent. I feel it makes me a bit inward thinking. Serious. Certainly not an increase in confidence etc. 

Although Lots of people on this sub talk about an initial 'spike' and how they felt so good on meds like methylphenidate  (and to not get used too it etc as it won't last). But I never felt that at all. So even 'we' are different

Maybe there's other clues (like how coffee effects us for instance) that would give you an idea as to what adhd med would suit you best?!!

I wonder if a ddiferent adhd med would give me that 'high'. I'm not seeking a high, but I feel that experiencing it would maybe mean that it's the correct drug for me, and that my brain was craving!

Sorry for the ramble. This was more of a stream of conciousness as opposed too a proper question! But i'm curious about those who changed meds in their titration and how different they felt for you etc",1,1735211252.0,ADHDUK,3,1.0,False

After playing around with Modafinil, I’ve noticed why it sometimes loses its touch after a few days straight. For some folks, it might even bring on brain fog or make it tougher to focus while studying. Here's what I've figured out through trial and error to dodge those issues: 

  
Hydration & Electrolytes: Modafinil can squash your appetite, which might make you forget to drink up. Water alone doesn't always cut it though, so tossing in some electrolytes—like sodium, potassium, and magnesium—has been a game changer. I sip on water and munch on a banana for that potassium boost. Since I started this, I’ve felt sharper and way less fogged up. 

  
Choline: Modafinil can drain your choline, which messes with acetylcholine levels that are key for focus and learning. Best way to top up on choline? Food, not pills. Eggs are budget-friendly (boiled ones are my go-to), but if you want something different, try chicken breast. 

  
Multivitamins & Iron: Modafinil gives your neurotransmitters a workout, so I keep mine happy with B vitamins (especially B12) and iron. Popping these daily has helped keep my mental energy up. 

  
Fasting Before Taking It: You'll get the most out of Modafinil on an empty stomach. Ideally, take it first thing in the morning while fasting, and hold off on eating for 45 minutes after. Doing this has helped keep its power strong and avoids building up a tolerance. 

  
Handling the Jitters with L-Theanine: Modafinil can feel like a mega-strong cup of coffee. If you’re feeling too wired or jittery, 200mg of L-theanine can mellow things out. If that’s not enough, go for a second 200mg capsule. It’ll help you feel calm yet focused, which is perfect for study mode. 

  
Timing Is Everything: Steer clear of taking Modafinil after noon or you'll struggle to fall asleep. Learned this the hard way, so now I get up early, take it, get my stuff done, and have an easier time chilling out by the evening. 

  
Wrapping it up: For anyone using Modafinil, getting your hydration, choline, B vitamins, and timing right can seriously up your focus and keep brain fog at bay. Make sure you're giving your brain the support it needs with Modafinil working its magic. Anyone else have similar experiences or extra tips? ",0,1735211107.0,fantasywriting,0,0.25,False

Another story? Gee Fred, maybe you think God is setting a pattern here for us to deal with our sin? 

No, I’m sure it’s just coincidental.

Next up? 

Jael. 

This time, when the Israelites went back into sin, God raised up Jabin the king of Canaan to oppress them. He had a general named Sisera. He commanded the army which included 900 chariots of iron. After 20 years of oppression, the Israelites cry out to God and Deborah ends up leading the Israeli army. God sends rain to bog down those 900 chariots and they win the victory. 

And Sisera, the general escapes — he runs away and finds a man named Heber and his wife Jael who were Kenites. There’s a story behind all that as well, but that’s for another day. Sisera begs for them to hide him and Heber and Jael comply. He goes into her tent (a huge social no-no in those days) and Jael covers him with a blanket. He’s very thirsty and asks for water but she gives him milk. Remember milk in those days isn’t refrigerated, it is warm and probably a bit cottage cheese/yogurt in its consistency. And Sisera falls asleep. 

To this day, the women of that culture are in charge of setting up and taking down the tents. The men are in charge of bargaining and bartering and drinking coffee. So keep that in mind. 

As Sisera sleeps, Jael takes a tent stake — 18” to 24” long and a hammer and pounds that stake through Sisera’s temple and into the ground. The Israelites are free once more and Deborah is judge over them for years of peace and prosperity. 

Which leads me to this. 

Who’s sleeping in your tent? 

Will you do yourself a favor and drive a tent peg through his skull? 

Gee Fred, wouldn’t it be better to ease out of this sin of mine? You know, cut back to three times a week and just wean myself from porn and masturbation? 

As a Boomer, I am obliged to say “been there, done that.” 

It doesn’t work. This story sounds a lot like what Jesus told you (and me) to do, namely cut off and cast away.

A low-level dps speedrunner sprinting ahead of others, pulling all the mobs, getting unceremoniously killed off and complaining that the others are too slow.

A stealther not waiting for the group to get through the stunned enemies with them.

Not waiting for others to get on speeders before driving through mobs.

Spacebar/skip spammers taking the longest in cutscenes or not helping out in fights.

Blowing a lid over someone making a mistake.

 

After running hundreds if not thousands of Vet FPs I can say that this mode offers the absolute best and worst of the game. I’ve had the funniest banter and laughs with squadmates, seen disgusting slurs and bullying, got great tips and tricks for any class I was playing, and seen that most ’high-end’ players have no actual clue about what they are doing. Yet love to complain.

My point is this: you are only one of four. Skipping cutscenes is just good manners: you don’t want others to unnecessarily wait on you. Yet the opposite is also true. Just because you know everything and have a specific goal in this run, does not mean others have to cater to you. Gearing up, farming tech frags/FP stabs, getting high-level ear/implant/relics for alts, levelling up fast, having a social interaction in-game, playing different content/stories, anything else: everyone runs this mode for their own reason. None is wrong, all are right.

We all know the guys who run through to the boss pulling all the mobs along the way and then just start hitting the boss while others have to take care of the small accumulated army. Like, no, mate. You either pull mobs to a secluded area where we kill them before engaging the boss, or you start AoEing them all together in the big fight. No other ways about it.

Also, if you are the group leader, it is your job to make sure everyone gets through the FP well and good, and has a pleasant experience. Which is why I always find it nice to remind others about some nuance a boss or FP has. Don’t engage HK when he goes under the metal. Stay clear of those little fire clouds. Stand under Shrek when he pounds his chest or he’ll toss you off the ledge. The jump in Cademimu. The little things. Most people know these, but some don’t, or don’t remember. It’s not the end of the world if there’s a mistake. And don’t expect others to have an anxiety-riddled sugar rush devouring coffee two hundred push-ups tearing cardboard at the same time attitude. It’s a Vet FP. We’ll all be fine with an extra five seconds. Say hello. Drink some water. Have a laugh.",25,1735210377.0,swtor,11,0.84,False

I spent the first few decades of my life swinging into and out of extreme depression that caused me to drop out of school, uni, jobs... 

I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD in my late twenties and given an SSRI but it triggered hypomania so I was switched to Lamictal instead. 

I've tried many other medications for different things this last decade and Lamictal has been the best over all for me. Minimal side effects (I thought) and I haven't had an episode of depression since I went on it. 

That said, I used to be a stellar student and highly intelligent but for the last few years I have terrible brain fog and it's really hard to concentrate, remember and process information. I've also been battling insomnia and rarely sleep for 8 hours continuously. I'm wondering if reducing the lamictal would help. 

I'm on 300mg. 

I am currently recovering from occupational and autistic burnout and trauma, so maybe that's causing the brain fog. I'm also currently not taking my stimulant ADHD medication and I quit drinking coffee 4 months ago to try and improve my sleep, so that might also explain something. 

I also stopped taking a very low dose of an antipsychotic a year ago, at the same time as I got COVID. My brain was definitely affected whilst on that but it has improved since stopping. 

The only other thing I could think of is that just over a year ago I saw a rheumatologist for what seemed like autoimmune disease and the first thing he asked was whether I'd been vaccinated against COVID. I said yes and he tested for antibodies against the spike proteins. He then said they were way too high and not to get a booster. I got COVID a couple of months later, so who knows if that's affecting my brain.

I watched die hard last night when it occurred to me that the tower in which the film takes place is a perfectly Jaquay’ed dungeon. 

There’s multiple floors and several ways between floors with clever elevator and hvac system usage. Multiple competing factions create lots of dynamic interactions. 

The tower itself has 30+ floors but they only really use a handful of them. Yet this was enough to keep me glued to my seat for 2 hours.

It caused me to rethink my approach to creating dungeons. In all honesty, it made me realize that I might have been over thinking things a bit.

Thoughts? 

...

Is *Friends* a dungeon crawl?  

I was rewatching *Friends* last night when it hit me—the apartments and Central Perk are basically Jaquay'ed dungeon hubs.  

There are multiple ""floors"" (apartment levels), hidden passages (like the window Ross climbs through), and dynamic factions constantly clashing—Roommate Wars, Ross vs. Everyone, and the eternal Monica vs. Chandler Cleaning Rivalry.  

The ""dungeon"" spans several locations—two apartments, a coffee shop, and occasionally the hallway or a beach house—but it's enough to keep millions engaged for 10 seasons.  

Honestly, it made me question if I’ve been over-complicating dungeon design. Maybe all I need is some snarky dialogue, secret turkey sandwiches, and a pivot strategy.  

Thoughts?

...

Is abstract thought a dungeon crawl?  

I was pondering the nature of abstract thought last night when it hit me—our minds are basically Jaquay'ed dungeons.  

There are multiple levels of consciousness, and countless ways to traverse them: introspection, analogy, free association. Competing factions of ideas create dynamic, often chaotic, interactions—logic vs. intuition, memory vs. imagination.  

The mind itself holds infinite possibilities, yet we only explore a few concepts at a time. Still, those fleeting ideas can keep me captivated for hours (or spiraling into existential dread).  

Honestly, it made me wonder if I've been over-complicating thought itself. Maybe all I need is a clear metaphor, some mental ""trap rooms,"" and the courage to confront my own mental gelatinous cubes.

No salt. No sugar. No spices. No alcohol. No coffee. No fruit and dairy. I have been on this for 2 weeks now and I still wake up with sore throat and earache like before. Am I too impatient? Are there any perimenopausal women on here who had experienced the same symptoms and may have been successful with hormones? Anyone successful with eliminating gluten? Thanks!

I (fingers crossed) will have the opportunity to get a transfer from London to the USA with my job. My US office is in Reston and I will be required to commute twice a week. I'm used to expensive cost of living having lived in London so I'm hoping DC won't be a huge shock plus hopefully the US salary will still leave me better off than in London. I'm 25 female, single and excited at the prospect of relocating and starting a fresh. I have visited DC earlier this year but looking for some advise on where to live. I would prefer DC because I'd like to make the most of doing the tourist activities, joining sports clubs/ making new friends but also have friends and family come to visit me and show them round. I don't expect to have a car initially (unless necessary) so therefore would need to use the grey line to commute. It's only twice a week so I don't mind something up to 1hour ish commute which (my office is very close to RTC station). 

Where would you recommend I live? I was looking at Rosslyn/Court House area. I see a lot of recommendation for Dupont/Logan Circle but I don't know if the commute is too long.

For extra background, I'm not into clubbing scene but I like hiking, walking, coffee and would like to find a club or group of friends and be able to attend NBA games, go to talks and seminars etc. 

Looking to spend no more than $2,300 USD all in for a 1BD. Also do any flats come furnished or is it typical to furnish yourself? Must have in unit washer and dryer, I like the amenities of gym, pool, co-working space etc but that's not a requirement and see that more in Noma which is the wrong side of the city for me.
