She's six years younger and has always been the golden child. Our parents almost lost mom when she was born so they've spoiled her ever since. Different rules, different expectations, everything handed to her.

I've been working on letting go of that resentment in therapy. Even tried reaching out to rebuild our relationship multiple times. She ignores me.

She's married to a Navy guy. They've been stationed all over including four years in Hawaii during COVID. Couldn't visit during that time. I actually get along great with her husband which makes this worse.

My husband and I have a three-year-old son. Our first after years of infertility and three miscarriages. He's non-verbal autistic. My parents' first grandchild and they adore him. My sister has never met him.

Last week my sister got orders back to the mainland. Still far away but my parents threw a huge welcome home BBQ before they relocate. I didn't want to go but knew it mattered to my parents. My husband had work so I brought our son alone.

Everything was fine until my sister left her Red Bull on the coffee table. My dad told her to move it because kids were running around. She said okay but didn't. My son saw the shiny can, grabbed it, and it spilled everywhere.

My sister got mad and told me to clean up after my kid. I said dad warned you to move it. My dad made her clean it herself.

After that she started making comments about my son under her breath to relatives. Thought I couldn't hear. I let the first few go. Then I heard her call him the r-word to our cousin.

I confronted her. Told her if she had something to say she could say it to my face. She got in my face screaming. Said she wasn't surprised my kid turned out ""special"" and that it's good my first three babies died because I would have messed them up too.

I lost it. Punched her in the face. She went down hard.

My dad and cousins broke us up. My mom dragged my sister into another room and screamed at her. I went outside with my cousins to cool down.

My brother-in-law came out to apologize. I said I only wanted an apology from her. He said he thinks she's jealous because my son gets all the grandparent attention now and there's no room left for her to be spoiled.

I took my son and left. An hour later my mom and two aunts are texting saying I'm an asshole for hitting her and overreacting. They want me to apologize. I refused. One aunt said I should be ashamed for ruining the party.

Now I'm second-guessing myself. I'm not violent. But she brought up my dead babies in front of everyone. Why should I apologize when she said that?

It’s a big, open-floor gym where you can basically see everyone from anywhere.

About a year ago, I locked eyes with this really dreamy guy from across the room. We held eye contact for 10+ seconds, and when he walked past me he gave me “the eyes” – clearly into what he saw.

Then I didn’t see him for a long time, probably because we had different gym schedules. A few months ago, I was walking out of the gym after a long session and ran into him on the street as he was on his way in. I immediately turned around and went back in for another session, lol.

Now we’ve had the same gym schedule for months and see each other like five times a week. We train when the gym isn’t very busy, and even though there are plenty of free racks, he still chooses the one next to mine.

Because the gym is so open, we always notice each other. When I walk in, I can literally see him look up and register that I’m there, smiling down on his phone after spotting me. During a session, we usually smile/lock eyes 5–6 times, sometimes across the whole room. We walk past eachother often, and we walk really close every time, even though there is a lot of open space.. It often feels like we’re “spotting” each other from a distance and just staring for a second or two before going back to our sets.

He fills his water bottle 6–7 times during a workout and walks past me a lot – he seems *very* hydrated. He usually trains alone, but sometimes with a friend and chats a bit with people he knows, so he’s not a loner. He also comes across as very respectful – he never does anything that feels creepy or makes me uncomfortable. He just makes me feel really good, and I love the dopamin hits I get from seeing him.

Sometimes he completely ignores me for a whole session, but it seems obvious that its a strategy, when he passes me, and clearly sees me, but doesnt meet my eyes or says hello, it comes across as a chase strategy. He seems like the type. When he does this, I ignore him right back for a session or two, and he always folds and goes back to our smiling/staring routine. When I did yoga the other day, I caught him staring several times when he thought I couldn’t see.

Because of work, I have to switch my gym schedule soon and will probably see him a lot less. The dopamine and the stares are addictive, and I’d really like it to progress a bit – some actual talking at the gym and maybe a coffee if I’m lucky.

Since he clearly isn’t comfortable making a move (or just isn’t that into me, I still know thats an option or that he just likes our thing, but doesnt want anything more), I’m debating whether I should ask him for a spot. We both bench a lot, and since we already smile, say hi and have so much interaction, would it be creepy if a woman in this situation asked you for a spot?

And if your gym crush asked *you* for a spot in this context, would you read that as flirting/interest? Or would you just think she needed help? Would it need to happen more than once before you took it as a real signal?",1,1765188688.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Nothing dramatic, nothing that someone would brag about, just these small, everyday acts that somehow make my life easier without me even realizing it.

Like the way she always places my keys on the same hook so I don’t tear the house apart looking for them. Or how she refills the water bottle on my desk because she knows I’ll forget and then complain that I’m dehydrated. Even the silly stuff — like folding my hoodie the way I like, or warming up my coffee again because she notices I got distracted halfway through drinking it — I never asked for any of this. She just… does it. With this quiet consistency that I somehow managed to overlook for years.

And the part that really got me? I realized she never points these things out. Never says, “I did this for you,” never tries to get credit. She just quietly loves me in these tiny ways that add up to something way bigger. It made me feel both grateful and a little guilty — like I’ve been living inside this soft cushion she built around my day and never acknowledged it.

Lately, I’ve been trying to be more aware — noticing when she’s tired, helping more with dinner, paying attention to her small habits the way she paid attention to mine. But I still feel like I’m playing catch-up. Like she’s been fluent in this language of small kindnesses for years, and I’m only now learning the alphabet.

So I guess my question is… how do I genuinely show her I see her now? How do I make sure she feels appreciated without it seeming like I’m suddenly overdoing everything out of guilt? I want it to feel real. I want her to feel understood and valued — the same way she’s made me feel without ever saying a word.

I don’t want to miss the little things anymore.

A while back, I posted a review here of the **ESR Rebound Magnetic Keyboard**. I stand by that review it is the best hardware alternative to the Magic Keyboard.

However, despite having the ""perfect"" hardware setup (iPad Pro M1 + ESR Keyboard + Goodnotes), I realized something terrifying as I prepped for my Aviation exams: **I wasn't retaining information.**

I wanted to share this ""unpopular opinion"" with other students here. Sometimes the hardware is perfect, but the *psychology* of the screen fights against you.

**The Great Unlearning**

From kindergarten to Class 12, I lived and built my life on paper. Every morning i hauled a backpack that was less of a schoolbag but a semi-portable archive of dead trees. Textbooks that had a certain smell when bought. Notebooks with dog-eared pages. The faint stain of ink and highlighters on my fingers. 

That was the rhythm. Heavy bags, ink stained hands, and the tactile friction of knowledge earned on paper. But beneath all, there was a quiet dream growing inside of me. What if it all could be different? What if every textbook, notebook and worksheet could live inside one sleek pad? No weight, no clutter. Just pure portable knowledge. 

In mid-2022. I saved some money. 

It arrived in a pristine white box. An iPad Pro with pencil, tastefully engraved with my name like it was made for me along with the best alternative for the Ipad magic keyboard (ESR rebound magnetic keyboard case).

After setting it up, the first thing i installed after Spotify was Goodnotes (shoutout to Goodnotes ). It felt like stepping into the future. Dream coming true. No more overflowing shelves. I imagined myself as one of those hyper organized students I saw on YouTube, every note tagged, every textbook searchable, every scribble backed up forever. 

But then reality hit. 

The price shock. Over a $1,100 for the iPad and the pencil, another $20 for Goodnotes, and the creeping realization that I had just signed up for a completely new way of working. It wasn’t just an upgrade, it was a mountain-sized learning curve. I was literally relearning how to write. 

And the feel? God, the feel. Writing with the Apple Pencil on bare glass was sterile, like skating on ice. There was no feedback, no resistance, none of that comforting scratch my brain had spent years wired to. I tried the matte screen protector “fix” but it felt like a trade-off with the devil. The writing was slightly better, but my beautiful high resolution display was now dulled and grainy. The iPad was supposed to feel futuristic, but it was already a compromise. 

 Then came the comparison game. I made the mistake of opening YouTube and Pinterest. Suddenly, I was drowning in “study inspo” perfect pastel highlights, immaculate margins and calligraphy level handwriting.

My messy scrawls, functional but chaotic, looked like failures in comparison. I wasn’t just studying anymore. I was measuring myself against a fictional aesthetic. My iPad, meant to free me, had somehow trapped me in an inferiority complex. 

This was my first brush with what psychologist call the metacognitive illusion: the dangerous feeling that neatness equals mastery. A digital page that looks beautiful feels like knowledge is sticking, when in reality it isn’t. 

But here’s the paradox. As I moved into my professional aviation training, I couldn’t just ditch the iPad. It was genuinely powerful. My textbooks were searchable. My notes were instantly 

organized. My handwriting was converted into typed text with a tap. Everything synced across devices. It was the most advanced, practical, organized study tool I’d ever used. 

And yet… it never felt real. 

With paper, there’s an honesty to the experience. The smell of ink, the weight of page. The little mental map in your brain finding where you wrote what, “the diagram was in the top-left corner of the page with a coffee stain.” That’s **encoding specificity** at work, which is how physical context anchors memory. On paper, you know where things live. On the iPad, everything floats in an endless scroll of sameness. 

There’s the effort. With books, studying feels like an act. You buy 3 types of pens, rulers, 10 colors of highlighters. You underline by hand. Furthermore, you scribble margin notes. You invest sweat equity into the page. That effort becomes part of the knowledge itself, what psychologists call effort justification. It’s the **IKEA effect applied to learning: the harder you work on the thing, the more it becomes yours.** 

With the iPad, ironically, effort disappears. You have millions of pen styles, colors, and thicknesses, but none of them feel earned. They’re just pixels. No matter how many hours you pour in, the notes never feel like objects in the world. They feel like files. Disposable. Empty. 

The iPad was everything I thought I wanted: portability, convenience, organization. But it was missing the one thing I didn’t realize I needed. Soul. 

# The Cognitive Nosedive 

When I began my pilot training, I made a decision that the iPad would be my one and only study companion. It made sense. Aviation is already digital. Cockpits run on screens, not paper. Why shouldn’t my study system match the future I was flying toward? 

At first, it felt promising. My notes were tidy, searchable, always backed up. No more flipping through fat textbooks looking for a buried diagram. I could carry entire libraries on one slab of glass. In a way, it was intoxicating. I felt efficient, modern, ahead of the curve. 

But then came the Technical General exam. 

If you’ve never been through it, let me explain. This isn’t like a high school math test where you can scrape by with “kind of knowing.” This is one of the unforgiving gatekeeper exams of aviation. A mountain of dense, merciless theory. Aerodynamics, engines, electrical systems, all crammed into thousands of pages. And in aviation, almost knowing is the same as not knowing. You can’t “guess” how an aircraft system works at 35,000 feet. 

And here’s the terrifying part: the knowledge wasn’t sticking. 

On the iPad, everything felt neat, but hollow. I could read for hours, scroll through PDFs, highlight in neon colors… and yet, the next morning, it was as if I’d done nothing. The learning slid off my brain like water on glass. 

It was the strangest, most unsettling feeling. I wasn’t failing because I was lazy. I was failing because the very tool I had trusted was betraying me. 

I was heading toward what I now call a cognitive nosedive: all systems looking functional, but the aircraft (my brain) losing altitude fast. 

That’s when I snapped. 

I did something absurd. 

I took my thousand-page PDFs, walked into a print shop, and said: “Print it all.” 

# The Homecoming

The printer groaned and clattered, spitting out stack after stack of warm A4 paper. The shopkeeper looked at me like I was insane. Honestly? I felt insane.. Here I was, the proud owner of a futuristic $1000 iPad, paying extra money to drag myself backwards into the past. 

But then I picked up the first heavy stack. I opened the first page. I pulled out a simple ballpoint pen. And I underlined. 

# The Uncomfortable Truth

I eventually passed my exams, but I realized the iPad was a ""Distraction Engine"" that was fracturing my focus. I needed something in between the ""dumbness"" of paper and the ""distraction"" of an LED screen.

I wrote a full breakdown of the psychology behind this (Metacognitive Illusion) and why I'm switching to E-Ink for my next phase of training.

No chest pain

The internet loves weird stories and strange little town experiences, and I have both in spades. My name is Lola, and I work at the consignment shop on Main Street. Don’t look at me that way, you know what I’m taking about. That little store that sells weird art, soap made by a bored housewife, maybe some essential oils from the local pushy peddler that swears it’ll cure your autism and a pile of things that are vaguely antique that always seems to be next to a fro-yo store or a virgin mobile? See, I knew you would get it. 

I moved to this tiny ass town a few years ago from Chicago and I’ve come to enjoy it, though it feels almost like a Stockholm syndrome type of thing. One night I packed up as much as I could in my beater of a camry, buckled my pet carrier in the passenger seat and drove away from the city I grew up in. I drove until my universal joint gave the ghost and ended up here with a busted car, a pissed off cat and $37.24 to my name. 

Through sheer dumb luck, the owner of this fine establishment was looking for some short term help and had a studio apartment above the store in need of a fuzzy creature to eat the spiders so Demeter and I took the jobs. Short term help became long term when Mr. Shriner, the owner; had a stroke and couldn’t take care of things anymore. He’s alright now all things considered, beyond a wheelchair and a Sylvester Stallone snarl on the left side. We see him around town sometimes, and he always sends his nephew with fresh catnip for Demeter when he comes to collect the bank bag. 

“Lola, why are you telling me all this for a Reddit post? Tell me about the weird shit in your store.” It’s called building the world, let me have my fun. 

Anyway, back to my store. We have regulars that come in, both buyers and sellers. Consigners? People who provide the weird shit we sell. I’ll introduce you to a few.  

There’s Karen, who sells essential oils (I’m not kidding, her name is Karen, she looks exactly how you think, down to the chunky blond streaked hair) and she comes in every Monday to drop off her latest batch from headquarters. She could be worse, but she gets pissy pretty quick if I cut off her pitch about thieves oil for my condition. 

Then there’s Rooter, he makes stuff out of reclaimed wood and steel he finds. His day job is construction, and he owns the company he works for so no one notices when all the lovely walnut boards disappear from time to time. He does solid work actually, I have one of his carvings in my window upstairs. 

My personal favorite, Mrs. Robichaux. She’s pushing close to eighty, a widow five times over, no kids, and a thick Cajun accent to die for. She migrated up here about sixty years ago from Baton Rouge, bringing her “magic plants” with her. She makes things with herbs from her garden. Salves, ointments, tea mixes, talismans, a really good spice blend for cheeseballs, all the good things from the garden of an ornery old woman.    

The shop is closed for the day, so I can take my time to tell you about this weird thing I found today while I wait for my takeout to get here. Shout out to Tony’s and their stromboli, best in town. (Only one in town but not my point)

So today is a Monday right? Monday is my busy day. I’m closed on Sundays, so we have to pay out our sellers, collect new stock and tally up all the countable things like inventory and money on Monday to “roll over the week” as Mr. Shriner says. I do inventory throughout the day when I have a little free time on my hands since the storage room is a straight shot from the front door, I can hear the bell ring when it opens. Demeter was watching the counter for me, stretched out across the formica top and cleaning her beans as she usually does when it’s her turn. I was shelving Karen’s oils for the week, dusting this huuuuge cabinet shelf thing as I worked when I brushed against a wiggly piece of trim. 

Before I continue, I gotta explain the store a little more. The Shriner family have lived in this town since it was just a trading post and an inn like 200 years ago. They of course, ran the trading post. As the town grew, the trading post became a general store, then that general store because bigger and started selling furniture and fabric and all those luxuries of the time. Then that general store became a department store, then they tried to build a mall outside of town but when the mill blew up and all those people died the population dropped pretty drastically so they stopped construction. Now it’s one of those places teenagers go to urban explore. 

Anyway, they were a huge part of this town and owned a few businesses that were divided among the descendants. Mr. Shriner was blessed with the family antique shop that he turned into our quaint little consignment shop. All the display furniture, and everything in my apartment are heirloom pieces he couldn’t sell when he switched the business. Ok, remember that. Back to Karen and her cure all oil.

So I tap this loose piece of trim on the cabinet right? “Great job, Lo. You’ve managed to bust the shelf that’s older than your grandmother.” I mumble as I look at the damage. When I run my finger over it, I feel a tiny metal hinge in the bottom that’s almost… rusty I guess? It’s gritty anyway. With a quick glance at the imaginary camera in front of me, a la The Office, I pop the trim open and underneath it is a rectangular button hidden in the wood. In for a penny, in for a pound right? 

If you dear reader, were provided with a mystery button in an antique cabinet would you not push it? Does it sell destruct? Would it spit out a million dollars in old currency that is now considerably higher in value because they’re from a country that no longer exists? A human skull? It was none of those but I admire your enthusiasm. This is Reddit, not a Nancy Drew game. 

So I push the little button, something clicks and I hear the creak of old hinges. It’s not obvious to me at first, but due to my condition I can’t exactly bend over to see what opened. I scoot my stool back for a better view, and peek at a door in the bottom panel that has “magically” appeared. I nudge it open with my foot and hold my breath for the most exciting part of my morning.
Inside is a smattering of curled up insect bodies, a thick layer of dust and a foot tall form wrapped in velvet. Despite the feeling of velvet making me want to pull the teeth out of my head, I pick up our mystery package. It’s heavy, and whatever is inside feels like it’s radiating cold air through the thick fabric. I nudge the door shut with my foot, and walk back to the counter with this dense thing tucked in one arm like a baby. 

Gently pushing Demeter across the counter, I set the… thing in her place. She merps in distaste at being moved and hops down, moving to her bed in the window. Obviously someone isn’t excited about our discovery. 

I peel the velvet away with hesitance to reveal a statue of a woman. The statue itself is carved from a smooth, white stone that’s not quite marble. The woman is wearing a flowy nightgown that would touch her ankles if it wasn’t torn up the side.  Her hair is hanging down in loose ringlets, and her tiny little face is carved in an unhinged scream of terror. To her credit, it’s deserved. This poor stone woman has been impaled on a stone tree stump, bent over backwards as if she fell onto it from a great height. The weirdest part to me, beyond the subject matter anyway, was how familiar she looked but I can’t quite pin who she looks like.

Truthfully the whole thing was beautifully sculpted by my untrained eye. Once I’m upstairs, I’ll call Mr. Shriner and see what he wants done with it but there’s Tony himself with my Stromboli. 



Tuesday, July 9th, 6:41 am

Hello Dear internet, I have returned. So I called Mr. Shriner, and he first informed me that it was common at one point for furniture makers to put secret cabinets in their work to hide valuables. Who knew? He also told me that the sculpture was probably from the previous owners and he didn’t have any attachment to it so I could sell it if I didn’t want it. Oddly enough, he didn’t want to look it over or have it appraised or anything, just told me to stick a tag on it for $150 and put it in the window to sell so that’s what we’ll do.

My stromboli was great btw, thanks for asking. 

I’m currently sitting in my apartment, drinking my coffee before I head downstairs. There’s a wicked storm outside, and I can hear the wind whipping around so today is going to be pretty slow. I kind of appreciate that though, I didn’t sleep great last night. I had nightmares about that statue, more specifically the woman herself. 

I am not new to nightmares, I’ve had them most my adult life. After I got sick, I gradually started having nightmares. It started once a week or so, then a few times a week, then nightly. Despite medication changes, therapist visits and at one point hypnosis, I still woke up screaming every night.  

That’s why I got Demeter actually, she’s kind of like an emotional support animal without the training. She’s a snuggler, and she’s pretty deaf so screams don’t bother her one bit when I wake up. She thinks she’s getting aggressively snuggled and I get to feel something real to remind me where I am. 

Anyway, back to the nightmare. So I’m in this big, empty building and I’m running down a hall. You know, the general “something big is chasing me” nightmare, but this time the hall ends at this little glass partition thingy protecting the edge of the floor. It keeps getting closer, and I can’t seem to slow down. I jerk to the side, hoping that if I turn I can keep running down a hall or something. Instead, I guess I overcorrected and spin myself around entirely so I’m looking down the hall I just came from, with my back pressed against the glass. I’m still running, but I’m being pressed back against the glass and i can hear it start to strain from the force I’m putting on it. I know I’m going to go through this glass and there’s nothing I can do to stop it so I look back over my shoulder to see what will inevitably cause my demise. One story down, despite being in a huge building, a rotted tree stump waits below to ram itself through me, just like that damn carving. When the glass finally shatters, I fall backwards onto the stump and wake at the exact moment I felt it pierce through my spine. 

It’s always loads of fun waking in a pool of sweat with the phantom feeling of pain right?  Once I came back to reality, I checked my alarm clock, debating if it was worth it to sleep or not. It wasn’t, so I decided to take that extra thirty minutes before I was supposed to wake to take a nice hot shower and actually make breakfast and here we are. 

Mr. Shriner’s nephew Ian will be here today to pick up the bank bag and I think I’m due for a visit from Rooter. He’s been making little puzzles out of old nails and they’ve been selling pretty well so he should be coming to collect. Demeter is very excited for her delivery and is currently yelling at me to go downstairs. I must obey my fuzzy overlord. 


Tuesday, July 9th, 3:00 pm

It’s hot as hell despite the raging storm outside  and this damn desk fan does nothing but blow its stupid little streamers at me. It’s mocking me, I’m sure of it. Anyway, Ian stopped in and asked how things were. I told him about the sculpture and he said, and I quote; “huh… anyway… bank bag?” I thought it deserved more fan fare than that but whatever. Demeter is happy. She’s rolling around the floor with her eyes as big as saucers. She always enjoys her stoned Tuesday afternoons. 

Rooter also came in today. He collected his check and dropped off another box of puzzles and a few more carvings. Exciting news for our little shop, he’s getting into woodburning! You heard it here first folks. He seemed excited about his new endeavor but he wasn’t entirely right. He said his daughter Sara has been sneaking out at night and he has no clue what to do about it. She doesn’t care about being grounded, and taking her car didn’t seem to stop her.

 “She turns eighteen next month, so what’s stopping her from just up and leaving in the middle of the night as soon as she’s old enough to?” He asks, his voice a little tight.

“She’s not going to leave in the middle of the night, she’s just being a rebellious teenager. She’ll settle down soon enough.” I tell him as I fill out his check. “Does she still hang out with those dinks with the camcorders?” 

Those dinks with the camcorders are the Brewer twins, Caleb and Kyle. They want to be directors or something and run around town with camcorders basically glued to their hands. To their credit, they have a couple cool short films on YouTube. I don’t understand how they upload the tapes though. Beyond my technological knowledge I guess. 

Rooter nods as he pockets the check and reaches down to pet Demeter.

 “She was in their last YouTube thing. The one that was filmed at the mill you know? I’m worried that validation is getting to her and she’s going to do something stupid.
Anyway…” He turns and walks towards the door until that damn statue catches his eye. 

“Hey, Lola… what’s…” he nods his head to it, though his eyes never seem to leave it. 

“Not a clue… found it in a super secret cubbyhole and the ol’ man told me to sell it. Interested?” I lean on the counter to grab packing material, knowing a sale when I see one. Rooter’s eyes never leave the stone woman as he delicately sets her on the counter and pulls out his wallet. I ring him up and wrap up his new girl, sending him on his merry way. 



Friday, July 12th, 10:30 am

We closed the shop early today. Sara Rooter is missing and I’m going to help the search party. Here’s what I know.

Sara came home from school at 3 pm, showered, went to her room and didn’t come down for dinner. Rooter said they had argued that morning about the dinks and their newest film project and she was prone to hunger strikes when they argued.

He takes up her dinner none the less at around 10 pm and she’s gone. Her window is open, the storm screen was sitting in her closet, her safety ladder was unrolled and hanging out the window. All standard so far but here’s where it gets weird ok? 

Her phone was still on the charger. What teenager goes anywhere without their phone glued to their hand? 

So Rooter picks it up to see if maybe there’s an inkling of where she went and the thing is bricked. The screen just shows snow static. I didn’t know smartphones could even do that. Not only that, but her shoes and bag were left behind too. 

The police have organized search parties, one goes to the woods surrounding town, one goes to the junkyard outside of town, and one goes to the old mill.  

Now riddle me this Batman, maybe I don’t know enough about police procedures but if these are the most common places for a kid to run off to in this town, wouldn’t the police have looked it over already themselves instead of calling in the locals? I get we have a very small police force but this feels almost incompetent. Whatever. Maybe I watch too much tv. 

Before I forget, to my knowledge right now, no one has talked to The Dinks.

In other matters, I had that same nightmare last night. Usually they don’t repeat but this time I seen something as I fell backwards. I think whatever was chasing me was a ghost of some sort. It was a cloud of dense smoke, leaving a trail of ash behind as it lumbers after me. Maybe the mall has a spooky smoke ghost haunting it? Can you imagine that, the unopened mall being haunted by the ghost of a builder’s cigarette or something. 



Saturday, July 13th 12:00 pm

The shop is open today, and surprisingly busy so I’m going to post this update real quick while I choke down my lunch. You guessed it, it’s takeout from Tony’s.
We haven’t found Sara yet. 

Rooter is a mess as you’d expect. He lost his wife about a year ago to the big C, so the fear of losing Sara too is gutting him.

 I stopped by last night when the search party was over, and he looked rough. He was in need of a shower, a nap, and probably hadn’t brushed the fur off his teeth since she disappeared. 
The weirdest part about the visit was his inability to take his eyes off that statue he bought. He was just as captivated it as the day he took it from the shop. It looked off though, I can’t quite place how. 

I thought it was all white stone but the limbs seemed to be a very pale flesh color. Maybe the lighting in the shop made it look white. We have those super fluorescent eyesore lights that wash everything out. 



Sunday, July 14th 9:13 am

Still no sign of Sara. Rooter is still a mess. Demeter is acting weird but she’s a cat so that might just be her being a cat you know? She keeps staring at that cabinet the damned statue was in as if it’s gonna reach out to bite her. 

I will admit I’ve been neglecting my shop and apartment so today is a deep clean day for everything. I have the shop mostly clean but I’ve gotta stock shelves. Karen had decided to up her stock because somehow, cinnamon bark oil is going to help us in this time of crisis. I can almost see where she’s coming from. There’s been a lot of volunteers in town since Sara disappeared, and they have been wandering in when they take their breaks but I really doubt they’re going to buy your mlm bullshit Karen. We all know you’re in debt up to your eyeballs for this company. 

Once I finish cleaning, I plan on visiting Rooter again this evening. Maybe I’ll take him some food.

I had that dream once again last night. Everything was the same set up but this time the smoke had arms. Not tendrils of smoke or anything, full on, beefy biceped arms in the color of the smoke, reaching out for me. Or maybe to push me through the glass? Who knows. 


Sunday, July 14th 10:08 pm

I just got back from Rooter’s. I stopped at the deli and grab some sandwiches before I went over but he wasn’t exactly interested. He let me in without a word and wandered back to his chair in the living room to stare at that statue again. I swear to god it’s changed. I swear it was white stone when I found it. But now that woman is definitely a pale blonde. Everything else is still smooth white stone. She wasn’t a blonde right? 

Rooter looked at the sandwich and set it on his coffee table, then his eyes drifted back to the statue. I didn’t stay long, I figured he was probably sick of people dropping in, and I can’t drive well at night anyway. 



Tuesday, July 16th 6:54 pm

They finally located The Dinks. They had been out of state for a family funeral but they did say they heard from Sara that day. They said she was going to check out a location for their next film but they wouldn’t say much else. 

Mrs. Robichaux stopped by earlier today for a restock. She brought a little extra too, gave me a tin of her herbal tea blend. 

“That child is as good as cold…” she says as she takes a puff of her cigarette. Usually, I don’t let anyone smoke in the store but who am I to tell this eighty year old with five mysteriously dead husbands what to do? “Poor baby’s with her momma now.” 

“That’s a little presumptuous, isn’t it Mrs. Robichaux? She’s only been missing a few days.” I look up from my notepad, feeling a frown creep across my face. 

“She’s not missing baby. She’s dead. I’ve seen it.” She taps her temple with a crooked finger and ashes her cigarette into her open purse. This woman is an absolute loon. Not because of the grim statements, but the purse thing. I’ll never get over that. I guess it’s better than on my floor though. As I open my mouth to respond, Demeter arches up and hisses, bapping that old cabinet with as much force a three legged cat can muster before running for the store room. “She knows too… cats are always the connected ones.” 



Wednesday, July 17th 2:14 am

I had that nightmare again. The smoke with the arms is definitely pushing me off the ledge. When I woke up, I caught the faintest whiff of sulfur and old plant matter. You know that sickly sour, earthy smell when you find a potato you forgot in your pantry? That. I smelled that. Maybe Demeter was playing in the cupboard. She likes to steal onions, so what stops her from snagging a potato and hiding it, you know?

Wednesday, July 17th 7:12 am 

They found Sara Rooter’s body. 

I wish I had a better report for you. But they found her body this morning. Someone reported a light on at the mall around midnight. 

Remember how I told you the Shriner family had built one but never opened it? I’m pretty sure they were almost ready to open it, with stores and all but within a few weeks of the big day, the gas line at the mill blew and threw a wrench in that whole process. 
Anyway, the police get a call around midnight that there’s a light on at the mall and they promptly went up the hill to check it out. When they arrived, they found the poor kid’s body.

The mall was built with glass partitions on each of the three floors to protect shoppers from falling into the plant filled atrium. In the center of the grand entrance, is a big garden bed thing, that has somehow kept itself alive all these years. I remember seeing a story about a terrarium that was sealed up in the 70s and hasn’t been opened since. Maybe it works like that. 

Sara’s body was found impaled through the back on the remnants of a tree stump in the center of the atrium, surrounded by glass from the floor above. 

The police are still there, investigating the scene but bad gas travels fast in a small town so I’m sure someone will come in tomorrow afternoon with everything anyone will know, whether it’s real or pure rumor. 



Friday, July 19th, 10:34 pm

I went to see Rooter after work today. He opened the door for me as soon as he seen me pull into the driveway and actually spoke this time but he sounded so… hollow I guess? I don’t blame him. He just lost his daughter in a horrid accident and his wife to cancer within years of each other. 

“You can ask, you know.” He mutters as he lowers himself into his chair, his arms shaking under his weight. 

“Rooter… I’m not here to-“ I trailed off when I noticed that goddamn statue in the corner. What I swear to god was once a white stone sculpture, is now painted in thin layers of colored lacquer. Her skin is still pale, and she’s still blonde but now there’s a rosiness to her cheeks that I know was never there before. 

“Ain’t she beautiful? She looks just like my Sara…” He follows my gaze, then looks back to me. Poor man… he looks like he’s aged ten years. He hasn’t shaved since she disappeared, and I think he’s lost weight. 

“They found her just like that you know? They said she was leaning on the… the partition up there… and fell from the second floor… but I don’t think she fell at all. That glass was shattered. Do you know how thick that glass was? A little thing like her wouldn’t have shattered it running at it as fast as her legs could carry here. I put the damn things in for God’s sake… didn’t know that did you?” 

I shake my head, though I’m not surprised. There’s not a lot of construction companies around here and the Shriners like to help the locals when they can. 

“Yeah… my first commercial job back in ‘00… I didn’t want to put the bid in but Alan Shriner basically begged me to… Anyway…  They let me see her before they took her away.” His eyes cloud over a little, drifting back to seeing her that last time. “She looked so scared, and she was so cold. They had her covered, but they moved it for me… she looked perfect beyond the… the…” His hand drifts over his chest. I nod so he’ll continue but push myself to my feet to find him something to eat. 

“When they brought the gurney in to take her away, they made me leave but I snuck back in. I went in through a fire entrance on the side and I watched them… M-move her from the second floor… The spot she fell from. I needed to see if the glass had maybe fallen from its bolts or something but they were still solid… she went through the glass.” I return with a couple pieces of toast and set them in front of him, then sit back down. 

“I’m so sorry Rooter…” I can’t seem to say anything else. 

“And this…” His voice wavers for a second before he scrunches his face up. He collects himself quickly and clears his throat, setting his hands in his lap. “I think someone pushed her… and I think they were hiding around in the mill before they did it… there was ash everywhere up there. Like someone cut a hole in a bag of it and drug the bag around to make a trail.” 

“You think someone…” I trail off, the idea taking the air from my lungs. Sara was just a kid. Sure, she got in trouble with The Dinks while she was filming, but nothing dangerous. Just normal teenage stuff. Why would someone kill her for that? 

Rooter nods as tears begin to roll down his scruffy cheeks. “Someone murdered my girl. I just know it.”  

I left shortly after that. He started to drink, and didn’t seem to want the company anymore. 

Demeter waited for me at the door as I got upstairs, and I think she knew something wasn’t right. She’s been up my tail, or more specifically across my shoulders the entire time I’ve been home. She makes an excellent scarf when she wants to be I guess. I’m going to shower and go to bed. Today has been painfully long and exhaustingly sad.

I had my rescheduled specialist appointment on Thursday. Dr Vampira spent the day with Terrifying Auntie and came home with a hand-knitted flamingo, extending the range of conditions she can treat with stuffed toy therapy.

I came home via the Asian Grocery, and my son Marty got very excited when he realised I'd bought dried shrimp, bonito flakes and seaweed sheets. Yes, that means Mum was making furikake again. (I used to make furikake at home, but got out of the habit during COVID lockdown, and only thought of it again recently.)

Then he found the big packet of dried shiitake mushrooms I'd bought. 

Marty (suspiciously): What are you planning to do with these? 

Me: Well I thought I'd have a go at making beef wellington...

Marty: (Laughs so hard he nearly busts his pooffoo valve.)

Seriously, I grind the shiitake mushrooms into a powder to use for a really mushroomy flavour. My poor coffee grinder has ground up dried shiitakes, dried shrimp, whole spices, seeds, nuts, toasted seaweed sheets and dried garlic slices. The one thing it has never ground? Coffee beans. 

Bonus cheat's cooking from the Feral Housewife: tonight's dinner was a chicken cashew curry. The chicken was out of a packet from the supermarket, and so was the celery. The peas were from a bag in the freezer. The cashews came out of a scoop and weigh bag. The curry sauce was out of a sachet, and the chicken stock was from a tetra pack. The only ""proper"" item was the onion, but even then Martin says he put them in a plastic bag to weigh them. The rice was nuked in a sachet. 

You can tell I'm gunning for the ""Okayest Mother of the Year"" award in 2026.

(Part 1 of 2),"I swing the shovel down for a final time, officially flattening the dirt. I sledged the cross into the head of the grave. I took a step back, unable to acknowledge my handiwork due to the blurriness of tears coming on. I made sure the grave was facing South so that he could see both the sunrises and the sunsets. ""I love you, Ash."" I managed to say to the desolate patch. I hope his journey is easy.

Turning away while picking up the spade, shovel, and sledgehammer, I load them onto the back of the four-wheeler and head back down the wavy hill. It's weird to think that outside will now be his permanent home, given he has only run out a handful of times. The five-minute descent dragged like hours.

The evening sun danced through the trees on my right like someone had covered the sky with a fishnet. The Four-Wheeler tore through the calmness of the farm as I pulled into the garage out back. I left the tools and the gas can bungee-corded to the rack on the back of the ride, convincing myself that I'd be saving time by not putting them back where they belonged, but in reality, I didn't want to put the effort in. Inputting the code and letting the garage door shut behind me, I just barely tilt my head to see the little site at the top of the hill. 

My brain mentally snaps a picture of the scene. The fog of memory turns the vision into a watercolor smear. A streaked green hill, orange-red evening sun, the tiniest blotch of light brown that gradients to the dark brown beneath it, and behind that, the ever-expanding deep green woods that go just beyond the ridgeline. The ridgeline that gives it its pronounced shape on the land of Eastern Kentucky.

My stomach grumbles, reminding me that I'm still alive and there are still things that need to be done. The front door opens just enough for me to step through, my open hand down by the ground, ready to catch any futile attempt to get out. He has always wanted to go outside, darting at the door every chance he gets. I never let him, it posed far too much of a risk with him running off into the wilderness, and me unable to catch him. But he's not there to express his cravings for the outdoors. There is no longer a greeting when entering this home. 

While the air fryer ticks, I latch onto meaningless thoughts, tomorrow's shift, my chores, anything but reality. Oh yeah, that's something I can put my mind to. In the stillness of the dining room, I had to take some time to clear my thoughts before actually starting to type on my phone. 

* Do dishes
* Sweep and mop the kitchen
* Clean out the litterb-

The beeping of the air fryer interrupted my typing. I get up, empty my chicken onto my plate, and sit down to eat. 

I ate in peace. No little paws batting at the edges of my plate. No meows begging for food. Just the occasional sound of chewing. There's a lingering feeling of misplacement in my mind. Things just are not right. The never-ending feeling of anticipation to see a gray streak run through the house tricks my eyes. This stuff has its unique way of making a permanent home in your brain. Just a monkey brain with pattern recognition. Unfortunately, the patterns I failed to consciously take note of before today are coming back to harass my peripherals. I just still feel like he is still around, maybe just under the table, imagining my legs as his very own scratching post. Why would God allow this?

 I gift the sink my plate as I start my nightly routine, cutting my evening short. Brush my teeth, turn on the fan, and open the canned wet food for Ash. I hope it's empty by tomorrow morning. I hope I wake up with barely any breath in my lungs from him loafing on my chest. I pull the blanket over me and begin to hold my knees as close to me as I can. The chore list, going unfinished and unanswered, as does the can of wet food.

*I dreamed I was walking along the beach with*

*the Lord. Scenes from my life flashed across the sky. In*

*each, I noticed divots in the sand. Sometimes there were*

*Divots and footprints; other times, there were only divots.*

*During the low periods of my life, I could see only the divots,*

*so I said, ""You promised me, Lord, that you would*

*walk with me always. Why, when I have needed you most,*

*have you not been there for me?""*

*The Lord replied, ""The times when you have seen only the divots,*

*My child, is when I carried you.""*

*The Lord and I reached the end of our beach,*

*Arriving at my bedroom door.*

*The door rips through its cheap wooden trim.*

*The cross hanging on the door falls to the floor.* 

*We then turn to see me lying on the bed.*

*Sound asleep, unaware of the lord's palpi.*

I got up to my alarm, not to the usual headbutting of an attention-seeking companion. My face stuck to the damp pillow as I attempted to rise out from the comforter. Hopping out of bed onto the cold wooden floor, my feet hit with an almost silent meaty slap. ""Oh, good god,"" I muttered. The door's destroyed. Maybe I did it in my sleep. I've been stressed, but not like this. I finally remember my dream.

Upon the memory coming back, I check the entire house for a break-in just in case. Nothing. Jesus, the stress must be getting to me. I can't believe I would do that in my sleep. Sure, I've broken things before by being dumb and putting too much strength into it, but this is a new level. I made a silent agreement with myself that I would fix it when I got home, and I began to get ready for work. But upon grabbing my clothes out of my dresser, I stepped on the same cross that had fallen from the door. Rather than picking it up, I scooted it under the dresser with my feet. Sliding the symbol that used to resonate with me away into darkness as if it were a spent torch.

I hung that cross up originally when I was an avid churchgoer. I did all the things a Christian should: follow the word, spread the gospel, and treat everyone neighborly. Over time, though, shortly after getting saved, I lost my will to commit to it. I came to enjoy life more, and religion went onto the back burner. 

I finally got to work, and upon walking through the gate, I heard someone behind me say, ""Waddup, Eli."" I knew the voice immediately, along with who he was speaking to. I turned to see Chantz. Chantz is my lifelong friend whom I work with on a team. He is a little taller than I, with shoulder-length brown hair and a scruffy beard. Built more muscular than I am, he stands broadly before me, waiting for my response.

""Hello,"" I say in a cheery tone, yet I could feel the word lacking substance as it came out. I knew he could tell I was feeling different, and that look he gave me was a sign of what I knew he was about to ask. But before he even got the opportunity, I took hold of the conversation. ""Man, I am just not feeling this place today, but hey, I'm here.""

""I feel you, I almost called off but decided fuck it, might as well come in."" He said in his normal tone. Thank god he didn't pry anymore, crisis averted. I don't even want to think about yesterday; I simply want to go into autopilot and let my emotions dwindle.

The rest of the workday went as normal. I unloaded the trucks and got to leave at a decent time once all of the work was done. When walking outside, I was hit with the sun right in my face, causing my eyes to painfully contract. Once they got used to the outdoors, I realized that Chantz was standing next to where we usually park. Walking over and unlocking my car, I heard him ask me a question.

""Wanna hang out?"" 

""Nah, not today, I still don't feel the best.""

""Alright then, I'll talk to you later, be safe."" He said as his car shifted into drive.

""You too."" I rolled up my window and began the journey home. Almost like a switch flipping, I felt the tears coming as I turned out of the parking lot. Though I didn't want to be a random dude crying his eyes out while driving, as traffic in the opposite lane could see me. I locked my face into place. I was back to normal. It hurts knowing I wasn't going home to him.. I pulled into the farm, I call it a farm despite having no animals other than him, as I'm allergic to everything. I simply built an immunity to Ash.

I went inside and walked to my room to put my phone on charge. I dove onto the unmade bed and connected my device to the wall. Chantz had already messaged me, asking if I got home safely. I told him I did, and he followed up with a simple ""Good."" I spend a lot of time just mindlessly scrolling on the phone when my stomach screams for nourishment.

""I guess I could get something to eat,"" I said to no one as I got up. Then I turned and saw it, which resulted in my heart feeling like it was being pulled apart. The wet food can was still full. Not even a single lick of the liquid was gone from it. Throughout last night and a good part of the day, I assumed he would end up eating his whole can of wet food. Ash didn’t continue our routine. Usually, when he finished, it would sit on the floor just next to where I slept. He'd sometimes even push it so far that it would end up under the bed. I always imagined it was his way of saying, ""I'm all done, another please!"" I got reminded of his fate all over again.

The air fryer still has residue from the chicken, so I instead opted for a can of Soup. The hill he's lying on top of is just barely in view through the large window in the same room as I. I only took a couple of bites before throwing the rest of the freshly made food away. The plate from yesterday gained a new roommate as I reassured myself that it can wait another day.

I did my nightly routine, brushed my teeth, turned on the fan, and stopped myself from grabbing another can of cat food. Lying down, I tried to force myself to sleep by replaying the memories of him jumping on the bed and joining me for slumber. With the bedroom circulating the air of the room temperature meat, I fell asleep. 

*Ash and I were sitting in church. The same Church I have always gone to. They must have changed it in the last couple of years since I've stopped going. They have gone for a more naturalistic design. We were in the fourth pew back from the front, and Ash was lying on my lap. Everyone, including me, was dressed in normal Church attire. At the head of the church, a preacher stood in front of the Altar rather than behind. The Preacher had a smooth yet covered face. It wasn’t smooth like baby skin, but as in a face that represented sanded wood that had fallen in honey. No eyes, no mouth, only a smaller-than-usual nose rested upon his head. With a wave of his hand, a gramophone started playing a sermon. The words of the sermon were lost on my ears as the gramophone did not speak, rather it portrayed. I felt the feeling of fear along with faith being intertwined in my soul when the record started spinning. Followed by a forceful mixture of anger and joy. These four emotions were tossed into the blender of my body and forced to coincide in a holy union. Once the emotions reached their homeostasis, the urge to pay attention to the preacher was overwhelming. All of the faces around me, all of whom I did not recognize, looked at the man up front, and I followed suit.* 

*He held his hands above his head to praise the awesome and righteous lord above. In his hands appeared a black and white yin and yang symbol that went from a concept to a physical disk in his hand. I then realized that it was the vinyl record that had been playing on the gramophone. He broke it into two pieces, both halves of the opposite color. The white piece matched his robes, while the black piece matched the altar behind him. In unison, we all lift our hands, palms out, towards the man, and we are all granted our own piece of the cruel and the compassionate. The black half sank into my left palm, not as a gift, but as a hot knife sat on top of cold butter. The white half floated just out of my right palm, never obtainable, no matter how far you reached.* 

*The preacher held the white piece towards the sky as an offering to god, who partook in all of our compassionate halves. The only thing keeping us from being evacuated upwards was the tendrils that extended from under the preacher's outfit, branching throughout the underbelly of the pews. That wrapped around our ankles like a professional arm wrestler. We avoided gazing upon the face of the holiest of holies, so we bowed our heads, still keeping our eyes open. Ash did not. He looked directly at the Alpha and the Omega, and as a result, he went still. My lap gained frostbite from how cold he fell. He was no more. God had looked upon all he had gained, and behold, it was very good.*

*I feel the corruption of the black half has been cleansed. It contained new life. A new story. A new beginning. Everyone followed the preacher's movements as the black half was pushed into our chests with our palms, thus returning us to The Great Shepherd's flock that we have strayed so far from. God's presence disappeared, as did the preachers. I felt the frostbite fade as heat returned to my friend. We have been united through God's will and our faithfulness. Ash purred in my lap. It was very good, for all things were created through Him and for Him. On the front of the altar, hung a crucifix that was recently hidden by the ophidian-like body of the leader of this ceremony. Jesus, fixed to the cross, has nails driven into only four out of his thirteen tentacles. His gaze did not break from the floor, and his gelatinous chest was still breathing.*

I didn't go to work today. It feels as if my motivation is a well that has been drained. Despite that, I still pushed forward to get out of bed. I must have had an allergic reaction to something while I was sleeping. My arm was covered in circular, rashy blotches. They were in groupings of an overly tall triangle, starting with big circles at the bottom and smaller circles at the top. They wrapped and swirled around my arm as if someone had hit me with one of those arm bracelets in school. The thought of being in this room for any longer is nauseating. I should really throw that can away, but the chance that he comes back to the smell of his favorite meaty nutrients overrides my disgust.

""I guess it's time to fix you,"" I say while looking at the busted door frame. I walk out to my garage out back and glance up at the hill. I make my best attempt to ignore the emotions bubbling inside. In the garage, I grab a bag of tools that should have a nail gun and some other handy stuff in it, and head back inside. I get to my bedroom door, drop down on the floor, and start digging through the toolbag. A ball-peen hammer, a box cutter, and finally, the nail gun wrapped in rope. Unwinding the rope, my face frowned as the heavy tool I handled was not a nail gun; rather, it was an air stapler. A sigh left my mouth as I placed the tool back into the bag and made a mental note to go back to the garage later to get the right one.

Everything's just been so blurry, so unimportant. I'm moving through a mental fog that I can't even see my own outstretched arm in. I need to snap back into it. I need something to change. So I call Chantz. We agreed to meet up and talk about some stuff at the gym. I didn't intend to work out, just going to get some things off my chest. Time to get ready.

When I arrived, he was sitting in his car. I knocked on his window to get his attention, which made him jump a mile out of his seat.

""Oh, brother, I'm so sorry I scared you.""

""It's all good, man,"" Chantz said as he regained his composure, ""what're you gonna work out today?""

""I'm actually not gonna do anything, I'm really only here to hang out and try to get through the funk that's got a grip on me.""

""Well, come inside and we’ll talk about it,"" He said inquisitively. Once inside I told him, I told him all of it. I did a good job of saying everything matter-of-factly rather than letting the sobs consume my vocal cords. He was astonished, ""Why would you still plan on coming to work, you psychopath, take some PTO or something.""

He's right, I make it a point to never use my PTO, just letting it cash out at the end of the fiscal year. I ended the explanation by saying, ""The house is just so empty now, I feel like I'm being driven mad.""

""I don't know if this is the right time to offer you anything, but I'll just throw this out there. My sister's cat just had a litter of kittens not too long ago; she gave all of them away except one. She was planning on keeping the cat, but her husband is strict on their house being a one-pet household. Would you like it?""

His offer pinged in my head as if I just peeked out of a trench in World War 2. It feels almost disrespectful to offer a replacement for my friend this soon. Still taken aback by his offer, he continued.

""Or maybe you could just keep it for a little while? Just give her a bit of time to convince him, ya know? Kind of like a temporary home. I know you are a good pet owner, so I figured you would be the best person for it. Feel free to say no, though.""

I was contemplating my decision, meanwhile, Chantz had already started to text his sister asking for details about the cat. Before I could get another word out, he introduced me to the feline through his phone. ""His name is Savior."" 

""Sure, I'll home him.""

We agreed that I would follow him back to his sister's house to pick up the little one. Luckily, his sister is on my way home, so it's no big deal for me. I brought up the dream about the preacher to him, and he responded with an astonished laugh.

""Jesus dude, I didn't know you had such deep dreams. Mine usually consists of people in my life who have never met each other doing crazy stuff."" He smiles as he puts his gym bag in the locker.

""Do you believe God can talk to us like that?"" Upon hearing myself, I cringed; I sounded like a child.

""I don't think God is here anymore. I don't know how everything was created, but if he created a messed-up world like this one, I'd run away from it too."" 

Chantz and I have always been on opposite sides of religion. Despite us both growing up in religious households, my faith had lingered, while he viewed his as a burden. I quickly change the subject and we continue to talk between his sets of working out. The rest of the hangout was just a little blip in my mind, not significant enough to place in the timeline of my memory. Before I knew it, I was driving home. A little black and white replacement lying asleep on my thighs, causing my nose to run.

Opening the door with my hand leading in front of my feet, there was no resistance. My other hand contains the cat. He's cute as hell, but he isn't Ash. I show him around to his amenities, his food, and his litterbox. Right before sneezing, I sit him on the floor, free to explore his temporary residence. He immediately goes to the scratching post and digs his nails into it. Into Ash's scratching post. Resentment enters my system like a foreign body.

I needed something to calm me down, so I began to dig around in the closets. The first closet in the hallway had nothing but old vacation bible school drawings and crafts. The second closet had my college art supplies, which I knew for a fact had smokes in them. Back then, I couldn't be more stereotypical with smoking cigarettes and talking about the deeper meaning of the arts. I grab my pack of deteriorated cigarettes and head onto the back porch. Inside the pack, a black lighter is concealed. Sitting down in the chair, I flick the lighter on. I feel the tar attach to my lungs, and the nicotine puts some ease on my brain.

Some time goes by, I'm not sure how much though. Although I love the outdoors, it's getting close to evening, and I see a thunderstorm is on its way. Plus, I got an idea for an activity indoors. I went back to the closet, grabbed the art supplies, and sat down in the living room. The art supplies took up most of the coffee table, mostly pencils, sketch papers, and paint. Looking through my old drawings of mutilated monsters and other freaky things inspired me to pick up the pencil again. This time it wasn't to make scary stuff, but to print out a memory that had been ingrained into me onto the paper. I began to sketch the hillside, the sunset, the ridgeline, and the grave onto the blank paper.

When all was done, it looked decent, of course. Where it was a sketch, it looked a little all over the place, but it was good nonetheless. By the time I was finished, I looked up at the TV, which had stopped playing whatever music I had on. Instead, it was on the idle slideshow screen. Simply showing pictured memories, waiting for the remote to be interacted with again. I leaned back into the couch, causing the leather to rub together to make its unique noise, and enjoyed the memories. 

Then I see the first-ever picture I took of him. My stream of emotions runs easily with the serenity of Nostalgia, before being traumatically contaminated. From an innocent kitten covered in fleas and dirt, to my rambunctious, cuddly, and always curious friend. My friend, who had just days prior been resting still in the corner of the couch, waiting to be discovered, the fire of his soul already extinguished. 

Despair had ruined my evening. The sulking was combined with the sadness, which resulted in me relapsing back to just sitting there thinking. Wait, no, I'm not going to think, I'm going to do something to get my mind off things. I walk outside to take in the outdoor air. The lightning just lit up the living room as the storm was raging. I let the rain hit me as the humidity began to wage a war with the smog in my lungs from earlier. 

I wonder how Ash is doing. I mean, I wonder what he is going through. Is he just experiencing some kind of afterlife, or is he actually gone? Thinking about that, I remember my dream from last night. Can faith bring him back, or was that just another stress dream? Either way, I cast away any doubt I had about believing. Still drenched, I shifted to the couch just inside the door. Down on my knees, my elbows dug into the faux leather, making an imprint of my pleading pose. I prayed with all the faith I could muster up.

""God, my best friend had left a couple of days ago, and I'm just asking you to do something for me. Please watch over him and his journey to wherever he is heading. I'm not sure what type of afterlife he goes to, but please just allow him to get there safely and happily. God, if you’re feeling generous, I’d be willing to do anything to be reunited  with him again.""

My prayer was cut short by the instant drop in temperature. The air turned frigid, but my body turned into a furnace. It was as if boiling water was tossed into a snowstorm where I sat. I unwaveringly kept my eyes shut until I felt more than just the cold. I felt arms. The arms wrapped around me from behind as if a lover was begging a soulmate not to leave. The arms didn't even fully touch me. It felt like the goal of the hug was to show support to the peach fuzz on my body rather than my skin. The cold air hurt my nose as an aroma of a clean, floral scent submerged that sense. I felt… Faith. As if my prayer did something. I realized what was happening, and fear overwhelmed the Faith. I spun around with my eyes shooting open, along with my fist gaining the torque of my torso, yet the fist never landed on a target. I was alone. ""Oh God.""

I can't breathe, I think I'm having a panic attack. I'm moving everywhere. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. I rush into the bathroom and rejuvenate my face with tap water. The warm water feels like a relaxed vacation to my pores. I catch my breath and lean against the counter with my head in my hands. 

Did God just reach out to me? I mean, I know about the bible and a lot about Christianity, but I have been very lenient with my commitment. Was that fear… or something else? Vibrations echo into my shaking legs as Savior rubs against me. At the sight of the little creature consoling me, I pet the side of his head and begin to calm down.

Sleep calls me. I'm getting too overwhelmed for one night. I skip my nightly routine, no brushing teeth, the fan staying off, straight to the bedroom with a new goal before bedtime. I pick the cross out from under the dresser and hang it back up on the door. I slide into bed, my mind still trying to catalog everything that just happened. But before it could finish, sleep whisked me away.

*The cross I had carved used to stand as a header to his home. Confused, I peer around, taking in the surroundings. Perhaps I could find the culprit who did this. Straight ahead, behind the site, is the ridgeline. The smell of ammonia emanates from the trees that reach beyond Earth's gravity, acting as supports for the cosmos. Like splinters for some unfathomable behemoth, dormant beneath the permafrost of forgotten epochs. I shuddered at the thought of such a leviathan. The primordial titans from the glacial womb of the Paleozoic rising again to glut themselves upon the soft flesh of men, using these Appalachian monoliths to rake our bones from between their eldritch teeth. Drawn by compulsion or madness, I stepped over the ridgeline. The first move I make into the biome begins a chain reaction of tremors that shake the monoliths surrounding, scaring off any peering flesh in the process. I stand unevacuated. A Chthonian hut rises from the globe's jagged and warped skin. The hut, while small, seemed to be sculpted from obsidian frost that effused a vaporous purple. I cross the threshold of the structure and enter the tenebrous stomach of the woods. Inside was only void—no light, no sound, no time. A void that had always existed. That will always exist. Not mere absence, but a presence that consumes. An omnivorous nothingness, older than thought, deeper than death. I confidently embrace the absence, becoming atomized once fully enveloped.*

My eyes snapped open as I was flooded with a new curiosity I haven't felt since I was a child. Back when I was around 9, we moved into our new home, more towards the city. The house was a two-story building, the kind with the stairs that turn 180 degrees about halfway up. Every inch of the home, outside of the bathroom and kitchen, was covered in a new grey carpet that was comforting to lie on and play on. From the top of those stairs, I pushed a Lego semi truck over the edge and onto the stairs further down, closer to the first floor. When picking up the pieces, I discovered a little compartment underneath the side of the bottom steps.

Moving the thin wood that filled the slot, I discovered an entire area hidden under the stairs. The area was dark, other than the light I was letting in, so I went and grabbed a flashlight from my dad's toolbox. Once the light flicked on, I saw that the hidden area was covered in the same comforting grey carpet as the rest of the house. A place, discovered by me, where no one else thought to look. The feeling was an excited curiosity taking over my younger self. I felt the inner child make a comeback as I thought about the hut I saw in my dreams.

The timing worked out as today is my day off from work anyway. I attempted to roll out of bed, but there was resistance on my feet. My eyes barely peek over the comforter as I spot Savior sprawled across me, sound asleep. I waited a couple of minutes, and then a sneeze from his presence broke the silence of the room. He sprang up and leaped backwards to the other side of the bed. I took the opportunity to get up while I softly whispered, ""Sorry, go back to sleep, little guy."" 

Ash used to do the same thing, except he was closer to my waist rather than my legs. I would wake up and have to lie for so long, petting him before he decided it was time for me to start my day. His grey hair would be all over the comforter from how much he was stroked.

In the corner next to the dresser was the same can of half-opened wet food I had left out for Ash. It had changed. The label is missing circles all over it, as if someone has a dozen or so suction cups that rip the imagery off the can. Inside the can, though, it had been licked clean. I picked it up, only to have my hand be covered in what I assume was some type of thick spit. It emerged between my fingers when it finally clicked in me, and I tossed the can out of disgust.  I think Savior may have eaten the old meat and must've tried to spit it back out. The can slid under the bed from the launch, just barely scraping my bed frame with the popped-up tab. I couldn't count the number of times I've sliced my foot open with the serrated edge of the lid.

Too determined on my goal to care, I forget about the can and wipe my hands off on a towel from the laundry basket. I got my clothes on and myself mentally ready to head up the hill. I slide on my boots, attach my hunting knife to my belt, and walk out into the hallway.

The living room is left a mess from my freak-out last night. I'm surprised I didn't break anything. It's just resembling a receptionist desk that was abruptly left out of a long-awaited crashout. I pick up the papers and put them back on the coffee table, where my drawing from last night remains. Did I draw during the anxiety attack? Up at the ridgeline, it looks as if someone scribbled and then erased it. Scribbled and erased.

Scribbled and erased. Over and over. The paper is even weaker in this spot. That's not all. The bottom right of the picture, where an artist would sign their name, is not my name. Instead, it's marked with ""EXODUS 33:20"" in small, fine print. I pull up my phone and mutter the scripture out loud, ""Exodus 33:20 - You cannot see my face; for no man shall see me, and live."" 

The garage door makes its methodical movement upwards as it begins to open. The verse is still etching its place into my mind. The four-wheeler is just as I left it, ready to go. Wow, my laziness actually did save time. I pull out of the garage and start my ride towards the top. On the way, I keep reliving the trip I made a couple of days ago, but from a different perspective. Could there have been a hut up here the whole time? While my spade was boring into the Earth, could there have been this oddity just a couple of dozen yards away? Finally, I rise over the final lip of the hill and see my answer right before me.

It's actually there, I'll be damned. I click back into neutral, put the parking brake on, and the ride comes to a close. Hopping off the side and into the wet grass, I take in the sight. Just there, right inside the woods, is a hut. Maybe the size of your average kitchen. The walls are made of what looks like dirt, stone, and tree bark. It's as if a once-cobblestone hut had been decorated and rapidly aged by nature. I fully understand not seeing this structure the other day; it's practically camouflaged into its environment. The positioning is a perfect recreation of my dream. Approaching the hut, I make it a point not to stop, but to confidently strut inside and see what it holds for me.

It's incredibly empty. There are not even things scattered around; it is just empty. The walls are covered in moss, and the humidity in this stuffy room has to have at least jumped by 20%. The floor is squishy with a firm undertone from the stones peaking through the moist grass I walk on. In the center of the room, almost as if on cue, a stone falls in through the floor. My phone flashlight makes an appearance as I get down on one knee and look into the void. The light from my phone reaches no solid destination, only a fog. The vacant hole eats the light particles far before they ever land. Is there a basement to this hut? I take a deep breath through my nose to let out the most exaggerated sigh I could before being interrupted by my own bodily functions. I immediately started gagging as the air I just ingested came from this dirty, disgusting hole. It was like dirty dishes that had sat for a week, had sex with mildewed clothes, and gave birth inside a bag of Jack Links. Scrambling back to my feet, I paced out of the doorway, hoping never to experience that awful attack ever again.

Examining the hut further on the outside shows a lot of interesting stuff. Symbols are carved all over every rock and tree surrounding it. Not to mention the hut itself being tattooed with the same icons. Jagged edges and plentiful dots make up the symbols. I could not even fabricate an idea of what they mean.

My mind is trying to put together what this thing could be. What was its purpose? Who built it? Why is it on my property? Wait… My property stops at the ridgeline. Realizing I have been trespassing, I walk back to my side of the hill, where I stand and stare some more before I finally realize what it is. I bet it's an all-natural toilet built way back when hunting was the only way to get food around here. That would explain why its materials started to be reacquired by nature and why it smells like- Oh god, I just realized I probably just smelled and looked into someone's ancient outhouse. Pushing those foul thoughts away, my eyes naturally looked back at the sad sight.

I sat in the grass next to the wooden cross representing him and just… existed. I started to lean backwards, the blades of grass meeting my body from my legs, to my back, and finally to my head. Gravity has won its fight as I release the tension in my muscles. Staring into the sky while letting nature sing to me the hopes and despairs of the world. The endless azure stretches above me, within it, clumps of white reminiscent of frayed strings that move with methodical aimlessness. Just when I started to get a little too warm from the sun's display, the scent of petrichor overtook the odor that was stained in my nose as the wind began to blow. The smooth wind coursing through the wilderness like electricity in a far too advanced circuit caused an overwhelmingly distinct muffling of all other sounds around me. My autopilot ends. My brain molts into what it needs to be. I know how to see him again.

I could sleep here. I could sleep right here and let the Earth reclaim me as it is currently doing with what remained of my little buddy, just a couple of feet diagonally to me. I closed my eyes, not necessarily in prayer, but just to have a final word of reassurance. 

""Ash, you are the only family I have. You have been with me through my hardships. What kind of person would I be if I weren't with you through yours? I will travel with you through the afterlife as your guide. As your owner. As your family. All I need is a rope, and we will be linked forward and embrace what lies after.""

What sounded like hissing and a car driving over gravel screeched out behind me. I shoot up and spin to look at the hut. There's movement in there. I can't tell what it is exactly, but it's loud and vibrating. With my eyes only adjusted to the sunny outdoors, I only see shadows oscillating inside the dark room. Well, the only way to see what's happening is to venture forth.

I reappeared in the revolting hut, just standing barely in the doorway. From the hole in the floor, purple smoke fills the bottom inch of the room to heighten the arrival of its owner. The figure of greyscale static extended its single arm out of the chasm. Then the second arm followed, creating what looked like the shape of the letter M. Exodus 33:20 ran through my mind. My eyes locked onto my boots below me. On the off chance this thing was God, I'm going to take that verse as literally as I can just to be safe. What sounded like Velcro tearing assaulted my ears. The room grew darker, blocking out the doorway behind me with the thick vapor. The whole ordeal ended with what I can only describe as the noise a pimple would make popping under its own bloated pressure. My hands were shaking. Who was I in the presence of?

Silence was all that was spoken. I waited to hear my sins be told back to me in chronological order before I got damned. But nothing ever happened. No voice ever left the deity's breath as we stood in that standoff. My eyes were tracing the outline of my boots when, at the top of my peripheral vision, I could see His feet. I unintentionally locked eyes with them. I blinked at them, and from the biggest toe to the smallest, they blinked back. Fear holds hands with faith as I ask what I think I already know the answer to.

""God?"" No language came from him. However, there is a small hiss from him as the odorless smoke rises to my face. It smells of sweets along with a scent of burning. Reminding me of my past birthday parties, the smell brings me comfort. I'm going to assume that is a yes.

""What?"" The fog drops back down to reset the conversation between us. I catch my breath to ask a question, but my voice keeps trembling due to his presence.

""Do… uh.. W-what do you want? Why are you here?"" The fog rises, and the smell of petrichor from the burial site reenters my nose from the fog.

""You want Ash, don't you? Are you going to escort him to the afterlife?"" The disgusting smell violates my senses again, making my eyes burn. This time, there's ammonia thrown in the mix.

Falling to the floor and covering my face with my hands, I can't catch my breath. Did I ask the wrong question? Why is the penalty so harsh if so? That was definitely a no. I stand back up, my eyes closed, teeth gritted together, and ask, ""Then what do you want with him?""

Without warning, the pungent aroma leaves. What replaced it was hope. My curiosity was stifled as I understood. I already knew his answer to my plea. We have the same goal. My prayer has been answered, and not even in a mysterious way, but in a way I can't deny. He has my faith now. Determined and with an unconcealed smile on my face, I leave the hut. A brew of amniotic fluid and afterbirth trails behind me.

Approaching the grave, I notice what looks like wet suction cups have been placed all over the top layer of earth. I took a handful of the dirt covering Ash and brought it back to the temple. I made sure to bow my head before entering. God is truly here. He's here and he needs my help with his plan. Mom always told me that Faith would pay off in the end. I lost it, but now I am reborn again. It was always God's plan to lead me to this point. I cast the dirt out from my palm in front of me. It hovers just beyond my hand's reach and gets pulled into his perfect being. He then closes the gap towards me, and I lose my breath out of awe at how fast he is. The smoke rises, covers my face, and results in me being disconnected from myself. 

My eyes open to the sight of my own eyes closed. I am looking at myself in the doorway. My back to the Holiest and my eyes set on his vessel. His hand of creation then pushes me back into myself, my face colliding without ever touching. The smoke levels back to the floor, and I am once again bowing my head to him. 

I don't know what I could have done to deserve this, but His Holiness embraces me. He's going to return my friend to me in this world, rather than me meeting him in the next. How compassionate! I am a receiver of the Father's unyielding love and care! His Divinity expelled the gas once more, and this time, it made me sneeze. ""As you command, Father."" There was only one thing I knew of that made me sneeze, the lost soul whom I welcomed into my home.",1,1765187932.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False
1ph8lmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernote/comments/1ph8lmm/im_betting_my_pilot_career_on_eink_here_is_why/,I’m betting my Pilot Career on E-Ink. Here is why the iPad failed me.,"Hi r/Supernote,

Long-time lurker, first-time poster.

I’m a Cadet Pilot currently in ground school in India. For the last year, I tried to force the iPad Pro to be my ""everything device"" for studying aviation manuals. I thought the convenience would make me smarter.

Instead, I found myself falling into what psychologists call the **""Metacognitive Illusion""** my notes looked beautiful, but I wasn't retaining anything.

I’ve decided to ditch the iPad and move to E-Ink (waiting on my device now) for my next phase of training. I wrote a deep dive on why the friction of writing matters so much for high-stakes learning.

Here is the backstory of my ""Great Unlearning.""

From kindergarten to Class 12, I lived and built my life on paper. Every morning i hauled a backpack that was less of a schoolbag but a semi-portable archive of dead trees. Textbooks that had a certain smell when bought. Notebooks with dog-eared pages. The faint stain of ink and highlighters on my fingers. 

Hi, I’m Jay.

I take things to 35,000 feet, figuratively and literally. (Or at least I will, as soon as I finish ground school).

I’m a Cadet Pilot, a psychology student, and a writer, which means I have a professional obligation to overthink everything.

That was the rhythm. Heavy bags, ink stained hands, and the tactile friction of knowledge earned on paper. But beneath all, there was a quiet dream growing inside of me. What if it all could be different? What if every textbook, notebook and worksheet could live inside one sleek pad? No weight, no clutter. Just pure portable knowledge. 

In mid-2022. I saved some money. 

It arrived in a pristine white box. An iPad Pro with pencil, tastefully engraved with my name like it was made for me along with the best alternative for the Ipad Magic Keyboard ( ESR rebound magnetic keyboard case). After setting it up, the first thing i installed after Spotify was Goodnotes (shoutout to Goodnotes ). It felt like stepping into the future. Dream coming true. No more overflowing shelves. I imagined myself as one of those hyper organized students I saw on YouTube, every note tagged, every textbook searchable, every scribble backed up forever. 

But then reality hit. 

The price shock. Over a $1,100 for the iPad and the pencil, another $20 for Goodnotes, and the creeping realization that I had just signed up for a completely new way of working. It wasn’t just an upgrade, it was a mountain-sized learning curve. I was literally relearning how to write. 

And the feel? God, the feel. Writing with the Apple Pencil on bare glass was sterile, like skating on ice. There was no feedback, no resistance, none of that comforting scratch my brain had spent years wired to. I tried the matte screen protector “fix” but it felt like a trade-off with the devil. The writing was slightly better, but my beautiful high resolution display was now dulled and grainy. The iPad was supposed to feel futuristic, but it was already a compromise. 

 Then came the comparison game. I made the mistake of opening YouTube and Pinterest. Suddenly, I was drowning in “study inspo” perfect pastel highlights, immaculate margins and calligraphy level handwriting. My messy scrawls, functional but chaotic, looked like failures in comparison. I wasn’t just studying anymore. I was measuring myself against a fictional aesthetic. My iPad, meant to free me, had somehow trapped me in an inferiority complex. 

This was my first brush with what psychologist call the metacognitive illusion: the dangerous feeling that neatness equals mastery. A digital page that looks beautiful feels like knowledge is sticking, when in reality it isn’t. 

But here’s the paradox. As I moved into my professional aviation training, I couldn’t just ditch the iPad. It was genuinely powerful. My textbooks were searchable. My notes were instantly 

organized. My handwriting was converted into typed text with a tap. Everything synced across devices. It was the most advanced, practical, organized study tool I’d ever used. 

And yet… it never felt real. 

With paper, there’s an honesty to the experience. The smell of ink, the weight of page. The little mental map in your brain finding where you wrote what, “the diagram was in the top-left corner of the page with a coffee stain.” That’s **encoding specificity** at work, which is how physical context anchors memory. On paper, you know where things live. On the iPad, everything floats in an endless scroll of sameness. 

There’s the effort. With books, studying feels like an act. You buy 3 types of pens, rulers, 10 colors of highlighters. You underline by hand. Furthermore, you scribble margin notes. You invest sweat equity into the page. That effort becomes part of the knowledge itself, what psychologists call effort justification. It’s the **IKEA effect applied to learning: the harder you work on the thing, the more it becomes yours.** 

With the iPad, ironically, effort disappears. You have millions of pen styles, colors, and thicknesses, but none of them feel earned. They’re just pixels. No matter how many hours you pour in, the notes never feel like objects in the world. They feel like files. Disposable. Empty. 

The iPad was everything I thought I wanted: portability, convenience, organization. But it was missing the one thing I didn’t realize I needed. Soul. 

# The Cognitive Nosedive 

When I began my pilot training, I made a decision that the iPad would be my one and only study companion. It made sense. Aviation is already digital. Cockpits run on screens, not paper. Why shouldn’t my study system match the future I was flying toward? 

At first, it felt promising. My notes were tidy, searchable, always backed up. No more flipping through fat textbooks looking for a buried diagram. I could carry entire libraries on one slab of glass. In a way, it was intoxicating. I felt efficient, modern, ahead of the curve. 

But then came the Technical General exam. 

If you’ve never been through it, let me explain. This isn’t like a high school math test where you can scrape by with “kind of knowing.” This is one of the unforgiving gatekeeper exams of aviation. A mountain of dense, merciless theory. Aerodynamics, engines, electrical systems, all crammed into thousands of pages. And in aviation, almost knowing is the same as not knowing. You can’t “guess” how an aircraft system works at 35,000 feet. 

And here’s the terrifying part: the knowledge wasn’t sticking. 

On the iPad, everything felt neat, but hollow. I could read for hours, scroll through PDFs, highlight in neon colors… and yet, the next morning, it was as if I’d done nothing. The learning slid off my brain like water on glass. 

It was the strangest, most unsettling feeling. I wasn’t failing because I was lazy. I was failing because the very tool I had trusted was betraying me. 

I was heading toward what I now call a cognitive nosedive: all systems looking functional, but the aircraft (my brain) losing altitude fast. 

That’s when I snapped. 

I did something absurd. 

I took my thousand-page PDFs, walked into a print shop, and said: “Print it all.” 

# The Homecoming

The printer groaned and clattered, spitting out stack after stack of warm A4 paper. The shopkeeper looked at me like I was insane. Honestly? I felt insane.. Here I was, the proud owner of a futuristic $1000 iPad, paying extra money to drag myself backwards into the past. 

But then I picked up the first heavy stack. I opened the first page. I pulled out a simple ballpoint pen. And I underlined. 

# The Uncomfortable Truth

I eventually passed my exams, but I realized the iPad was a ""Distraction Engine"" that was fracturing my focus. I needed something in between the ""dumbness"" of paper and the ""distraction"" of an LED screen.

I wrote a full breakdown of the psychology behind this (Metacognitive Illusion) and why I'm switching to E-Ink for my next phase of training.

**P.S.** After deciding to switch to E-Ink for my training, I reached out to the team at Supernote. They were kind enough to send me a device to support this experiment. I haven't received it yet, so this article (Part 1) is purely about the *problem* with the iPad. Part 2 will be my honest review of the *solution* (Supernote) after I put it through the of ground school.

Love how close the cast is after all these years. In December 2018, Gong Yoo and Kim Jae-uck were spotted together at a Warriors game in Oakland, California. And last year, they attended a MLB Seoul Series baseball game with Hyun Bin, Son Ye-jin, and Lee Dong-wook.

Kim Jae-uck and Kim Dong-wook are besties who starred in The Guest together and they’re still talking about wanting to do the follow-up movie which was green-lighted but got back-burnered during the pandemic.

In 2021, Yoon Eun-hye asked Kim Jae-uck to appear on Fun-Staurant with her.

Kim Dong-wook and Gong Yoo have both guested on Chae Jung-an’s YouTube show.

When Kim Chang-wan was honored for his music career earlier this year on KBS’ Immortal Songs, he asked Kim Jae-uck to appear with him.

If I did this manually, it would take 8 hours or more. Here is the tech stack I used to get it done in 60 minutes.

**1. The ""Infinite Content"" Hack (Gemini)** I cannot sit and write 50 social media posts a day. Instead, I spent 20 minutes ""training"" an instance of Gemini to act as a content generator app.

* **The Setup:** I gave Gemini specific instructions on the format, tone, and structure of the posts I need for Pinterest and Bluesky, including asking it to generate image suggestions. I pinned this chat.
* **The Workflow:** Now, I just paste a topic keyword into that chat, and it spits out 10 perfectly formatted posts/pins in seconds. It’s a ""build once, use forever"" asset.

**2. Organizing Targets (Spreadsheets)** Since I did the research yesterday, joining groups was easy. I just logged into the platforms and joined the relevant communities.

* **Crucial Step:** I logged every group into a spreadsheet so I know exactly where to post what content later.

**3. The Automation Stack (Buffer + N8N)** I need to be offline while this runs, so automation is key.

* **The Basic Layer (Buffer):** I connected my accounts to the free version of Buffer. This lets me queue up 10 posts for up to 3 social medias at a time for simple scheduling.
* **The Advanced Layer (N8N):** This is my unfair advantage. I used pre-written N8N scripts to automate more complex cross-posting tasks.
* *Honesty Note:* N8N has a learning curve. If you don't know it, you will have to rely on Buffer and some manual posting. But if you do learn it, it's a superpower.

**Tomorrow: Launch Day** The machine is built. The engines are primed. Tomorrow, we turn the key and start driving traffic.

As of recent one of her family memebers is deathly ill and is going to pass away soon, im doing my best to comfort her and make her feel better but she is under imense stress and most of the time she takes it out on me and gives me the cold shoulder, i dont really mind it because i cant imagine how hard it is for her. 

As of recent we have very much shifted in our personalities, shes become very serious and doesnt even want to have joking or light hearted conversations. Its only depressing topic, real life and future related. Which i dont mind but you can imagine how bleak and gloomy that gets so i occasionally slip up or try to slightly alter the topic, because being always negative isnt somethimg im very fond of.

I didnt want to say anything as to not step on her toes but yesterday was the breaking point so i kindly asked her to tell me honestly.

In short she said ""recently i figured out that we are both very different, and i wantes to ask you for a couple days just to think about it in peace but didnt know how to ask you"", i read thag and told her that ill give her the peace and now i am here.

I really dont want to lose her, she is my everything and im the luckiest guy alive. This has been killing me, i cant focus at school or work and this morning i woke up and had a panic attack.

Anyway, she now has a girlfriend and has completely shut me off after calling me one of her best friends because its not “fair on her girlfriend” which really hurt considering I told her I had feelings and I just wanted to be in her life one day, her gf is now long distance as well so she even said it wouldn’t last but is now obsessed with her relationship- its been 2 months idk how long they have spoke for 

She refused to have a coffee with me due her gf but she dropped my things off face to face after 2 months space, when I gave her the option to leave it at my front door or see me, I still miss her and I wonder if people agree with me that she did like me, my feelings got very hurt and frustrated and it just feels she used me and wouldn’t admit she had feelings towards me

Kit:
Combat Mk1
Medium shield
2× Stitcher III
~150 rounds
3 bandages
2 shield rechargers
3 Trigger Grenades
Jolt Mine (optional but evil)

That’s literally it. 6-8k credits most raids. Bump up the meds or ammo if you feel like staying longer.

I live at extractions with this. They press the button for you, you take their goop and leave instantly. Win-win (for you). Obviously plenty of other rat hotspots work great too → Spaceport in general, dam tower, any red zone.


How it actually works:

Pick an exfil panel that’s open enough for them to feel safe but has cover or shadows right next to it. Half the points on the map are perfect for this. My go-to’s:
• East exfil on Spaceport
• South exfil on Buried City

Night raids/Storms are insane for this. You can literally stand in the dark like a psycho and half the lobby is forced to your button because there’s only two exfils live and no hatches.

Walk up, slap 2-3 Trigger Grenades directly on the panel, drop the Jolt Mine on top for extra spice.
• 2 grenades = dead light shield
• 3 grenades + direct hits = dead medium shield

Triggers have that 0.5s arming delay so you gotta click detonate a tiny bit early, right as their hand is reaching for the button. Timing feels weird at first but you’ll get it in like two tries.

Full stack + Jolt Mine either sends them straight to the ground or leaves them at 5 HP doing the stun dance while you spray them down with the Stitchers. Don’t reload, just swap weapons when clip is gone. Free kill, free goop, free extract.

Do it clean and you’re basically the clip you just watched: fat goop goblins walking straight into your trap while you sit there sipping coffee. If you’re struggling you can always bring some wasp drivers and drop them at the button as extra bombs.

The PvE-only crowd is already loading their pitchforks and downvote macros, I can feel it. That’s fine – more goop for the rest of us. Stay strong rats, keep it cheesy with goop 🐀

Tried the usual dating apps and honestly it feels like I’m completing daily quests at this point. Match → decent chat → sudden fade out → me staring at the screen like I forgot to submit an assignment. Repeated this cycle so many times I think I’ve levelled up in disappointment.

So… is this just a Bangalore thing? Or a tech-life thing? Or a “started dating late so now everything feels weird” thing?

Curry clubs, meet-ups at the Tate Modern, beers in Hackney - and of course our regular Sunday walk and coffee in Hyde Park.

These meet-ups are so simple - sometimes we get a spontaneous message in the group like “I’m going for a walk at 7pm if anyone fancies it.” And suddenly five strangers are chatting like they’ve known each other for years.

Dan and I are super proud of what we've created here, something like this can exist without being weird or performative.

So I just wanted to ask is espresso like an acquired taste or is it likely I just haven’t had a good espresso? I feel like all the espresso I’ve had has been very bitter/acidic and didn’t taste good. I like regular coffee’s/cold brew’s etc and I like the concept of an espresso to concentrate and maximize the coffee flavor but I just haven’t had a good espresso. Is it something you have to acquire a taste for? Is it really that amazing of a drink, it seems like a lot of people online and on YouTube rave about it but I also don’t know very many people who actually just drink espresso straight up. I’m probably going to get an espresso machine either way/no matter what people are saying because I want to try for myself and want to believe that people aren’t lying to me or themselves. Anyway, I’m curious what others have to say and if it took a while to acquire the taste? Thanks ",2,1765186485.0,espresso,6,0.75,False

1ph87fd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ph87fd/my_now_ex_best_friends_keep_telling_my_girlfriend/,"My (now ex) best friends keep telling my girlfriend I’m cheating, now I can hardly function","Hello, long time Reddit lurker, first time poster so forgive me if there are any formatting mistakes. Names have been changed.

I (21F) had my two best friends Jamie (21X) and Carter (19M) cut me and my girlfriend (22F) off back in early October of this year. About a month prior they both had ghosted me which eventually led to a nasty phone call with Jamie that left me hyperventilating, screaming and sobbing in the arms of my girlfriend as I had no idea why they were both upset with me. I received paragraphs of messages the next morning from Carter calling me a sexual predator, emotionally abusive, a backstabber and a snake. All while not giving any examples outside of twisting words I had said in privet to Jamie.

Eventually, I tried reconciling with Jamie, who I had known much longer and was closer with, about a week later. Instead, when they showed up at the coffee shop, they had a bag of my stuff I had left at their place or given them packed up to give back to me, and cut our friendship off entirely. I tried getting answers of what I had done wrong but i didn’t get anything outside of my admittedly poor word choices during the phone call.

Jamie then proceeded to contact my girlfriend, claiming I was trying to cheat on her with both Carter and Jamie. I was not, so obviously they had no evidence and my girlfriend just decided to block them. But they also began spreading info like this to other mutual friends as well and getting them to turn on me.

The following week I received a huge paragraph text from Jamie, calling me manipulative, abusive, and that I was going down the path of their physically abusive mother. Once again, their only evidence for this was twisted or out of context things I’ve said over time. But that they were telling me this for my own good and so I could get help and become a better person. (I’ve been in therapy for years and medicated for context)

From what I’ve gathered they started building resentment for me over time because I would do small things that bothered them and then they never communicated those things to me. I’m also autistic, (which is something they were aware of) so it also seemed I missed some hints that they claimed to have given me. I had also learned by the time they had started ghosting me, they and Carter had already planned to cut me off. They both just let it drag on for nearly a month and a half.

Finally, I decided to make this post because yesterday, Carter contacted my girlfriend nearly 2 months after the fact. Saying that he doesn’t trust that I told her the truth given “secretive” I am. He proceeded to send screenshots of the conversations between him and myself of him accusing me of liking him and that I was trying to sleep with him. Which I denied in the conversation. However i had already shown my girlfriend this conversation when it happened. She was pretty pissed off by him doing this, given the fact that, A. He had not brought any new information to the table, just insulted me and sent screenshots of a conversation she’s already seen. And B. If Carter was really concerned about her wellbeing and knowing the “truth” then why was he telling her nearly two months later?

While it was comforting that she had my back and believed the fact that, I started shaking when I learned this information and went into a panic attack that took the rest of the day to recover from.

As much as I’ve been trying to move on over the weeks, I’ve started developing PTSD like symptoms like, having nightmares that repeat what happened or add onto it, being terrified of running into Jamie or Carter that I avoid anywhere we used to frequent, being scared to post on social media out of fear they might be stalking my accounts, talking about what happened out loud makes my whole body start shaking, regularly having flashbacks to either the phone call or the last time I saw Jamie. I’ve also become extremely depressed and can hardly function day to day.

I’m just so horribly tired of living like this and it hasn’t even been that long. I’m barely making it through my classes and I feel like my mental state is just getting worse. I’m not sure what to do from here.",2,1765186335.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

It could be a cultural or religious difference. Anything that you have to accept but doesn’t really make sense to you.

For example, there’s a few off the top of my head, and I’ll see if you can guess where my girl is from. I’m sure I’ll think of more later.

1. If you take a sip of alcohol within two days of taking a single bite of Durian, you will die.

2. Don’t roll your windows down at stop lights. From my understanding, the car next to you will think you’re antagonizing them.

3. Don’t tap your spoon on the side of the bowl/cup (like after you stir coffee), something about summoning ghosts.

4. Don’t drink any alcohol before a bus ride, even if there’s a long wait and there’s toilets on the bus.

1ph810j,https://i.redd.it/humxpfy37y5g1.jpeg,I Think I Might Be Going Insane (part one),"A month or so ago I met this girl. Things were going relatively well for a while, that’s a bit of an understatement, we hit it off from the get go. Everything was moving quickly before those...events began to happen. About four weeks after we started talking she told me she was going on a trip for a while and asked me for a favor, she wanted me to house sit. Jane, well that’s what i called her, her full name was Janie, reached out to me on a dating app and we ended up meeting up one night for dinner. At first It was blatantly obvious that the both of us were only interested in a hookup, that changed very quickly.

After some drunken encouragement from Jane, I spontaneously decided to spend the night at her place. I awoke to a face, her face, hovering inches above mine; a soft but focused look etched into her expression. I jumped a bit, confused by my surroundings before remembering the events of the previous night. I opened my mouth to speak but before I could get a word in I felt the weight at the end of the bed shift. The blankets and top sheet pulling taut against my feet. Jane didn’t react for a moment, her gaze still locked onto mine. My attention, however, moved to the disturbance. I was met with the sight of a frail looking long haired cat. Its gray fur was slicked into plumes around its neck; they looked like little garlic cloves. I didn’t know she had a cat. I have no memory of seeing one last night, though, I didn't have many memories of last night anyway. She turned and looked over her shoulder before perking up and leaning back. 

“Caspurr!” 

She cooed out, scooping the cat into her arms and holding it against her chest. I was never a big cat person, not a big pet person in general. I didn’t have any growing up so I never really got the hype. She looked back at me and smiled, opening her mouth to speak. 

""Someone's hungry.”

She said, standing up as Caspurr leapt out of her arms and trotted out the door, down the hall to the kitchen.

 I stood and followed, grabbing my sweatpants off the floor and stepping into them. As I made my way into the kitchen a bright warm light flooded my vision, making me wince. As my eyes adjusted to the light I could see her, standing over the stove in a t-shirt and sleep shorts. She was preparing a pan for something. I made my way to her, passing Caspurr as he lapped up the mushy pile of wet food in his ceramic dish. The kitchen was large and brightly lit, the walls lined with white stone counter tops. I could tell from our first date that she was more well off than I was. Though this was the first night I spent over at her house the surroundings felt comfortable and welcoming, I didn’t feel out of place. Maybe my belongings being strewn about the rooms helped fuel that feeling. I heard the sound of oil crackling and my attention shifted to Jane as she lifted an egg out of a carton adjacent to her and tapped it on the counter top before cracking it into the pan. She did this two more times before I approached her from behind and leaned my head down, holding it above the crook of her neck. 

“Hope you’re not picky, it’s going to avocado toast today for breakfast.” 

She said. 

“Fine by me.” 

I replied quietly, raising a hand and cautiously placing it on her waist. She reciprocated the gesture, leaning into my touch and giggling softly. I stepped back and gave her space as the edge of the eggs began to crisp up. I knew she would need to flip them soon and didn’t want to crowd her. I can’t even remember the last time I had a home cooked meal.

 I made my way to the sink and began to wash the glasses we had used last night, some of them still had remnants of mixed drink left in the bottom. There were four glasses, two of them had a deep purplish red lipstick stain on the rim. The ones that didn’t must have been mine. I lifted one of the cups without the lipstick stains to rinse it and noticed a black grainy residue at the bottom of the glass. Back then i didn’t think much of it, now i wished i would have just given it a second thought. I turned the tap on and filled the glass up with water, diluting the remaining contents and dumping it out. It took only about five minutes to hand wash the few glasses. By that time Jane was already setting plates down at the kitchen island and taking a seat on one of the bar stools. I followed her actions and sat across from her, reaching out to the plates in the middle of the counter top. Before I could grab one Jane swiftly and casually snatched the plate away, pulling it over to her and smiling. Now there was only one plate left, I slid it towards me and looked down at it. The food was nearly identical to what was on her plate. I figured maybe she just added a different seasoning to hers and didn’t want me to have that one. I must have had a look or something on my face because she quickly broke the silence. 

“I have celiac disease.”

She said, pointing down to the toast.

“Oh.”

I replied, feeling relieved for some reason. 

“I’ll keep that in mind when it’s my turn to cook.”

I laughed and she followed, leaning over the counter and bracing herself against it. The laughter faded and was replaced by the sound of fork scratching against ceramic dishes. We ate mostly in silence, momentarily breaking out into small talk every now and then. When she was nearly done with her food she spoke. 

“Can I ask you a favor?”

She asked.
“Yeah, go for it.”

I replied through a mouthful of food.

“Well, I'm leaving town for a few days tomorrow and was wondering if you would be interested in taking care of things around my house for a bit while I'm away.”

She mentioned previously how she was taking a trip out of the state for a week while she visited family across the country. 

I paused and thought for a moment. I was only scheduled to work three consecutive days this week, not to mention her house was only a 20 or so minute drive away from mine. 

“I just need someone to water my plants and feed Caspurr while I'm gone.”

She added, putting her fork down and looking up at me. I felt a bit of pressure, but I did like her a lot. More than I planned to.
“Yeah, sure. I can do that”

I replied. Her eyes lit up and she smiled at me.

“Thank you! I owe you one, seriously.”

Her voice took on a relieved tone. 

“Don’t mention it.” 

I smiled before finishing my food and stacking my dishes. I went to stand up and grab hers as well, as she had also finished eating. Before I could she nearly jumped out of her seat, her chair scraping against the tile floor and echoing throughout the large kitchen. She hurried over to me carrying her plate and snatched up the dishes I had sitting on the counter.

“Sit.” 

She said, something about her expression and tone made it feel like more of a demand than like she was doing me a favor.

“Allow me.”

Her tone completely changed, taking on something more playful. I watched as she took our plates over to the sink and began washing them. I was going to say something to her but before I could my vision blurred for a second and I felt the sensation of a splitting headache. I winced and pressed my hand against my face, trying to block out the light. I think she looked back at me because the sound of her movement stopped. I couldn’t see her but the only sound I could hear now was running water. The sound of footsteps replaced the silence and I could hear them getting closer to me. 

“Whats wrong?”

She said quietly, sounding concerned. She leaned over me, blocking out some of the light from the window and gently placing her hand to the side of my face. 

“My head, it’s pounding”

I groaned out, leaning into her. She carefully wrapped her arms around me and whispered.

“Vodka Cranberry, fun til it isn't huh?. Let me get you some water and tylenol. Why don’t you go lay down?”

I nodded and leaned away from her before steadying myself enough to stand. Once I'm successfully upright Jane walked off and opened a cabinet and began rummaging around inside. I turned away and walked past the staircase into the living room. My shoes and jacket are strewn around the floor making more obstacles to navigate around. Once I made my way to the couch I carefully laid down. I could feel my heart thumping in my head, this was the most serious migraine I have had in a while. I wasn’t thinking about it long before Jane hurried into the living room, crouching down and setting two pills in my hand. She assisted me with sitting up and I popped them into my mouth, taking the glass of water from her and chugging nearly the whole thing. I laid back down and felt a wave of nausea, in an attempt to relieve it I rolled over on my left side. It subsided enough for me to feel somewhat comfortable. So comfortable that at some point I must have fallen asleep. By the time I had woken up the sun had begun to set.  My headache had faded but was definitely still there, just less aggressively. I groaned and flopped onto my back, preparing myself to stand. I heard Jane walking down the stairs and she nearly walked past me before realizing that I was awake. She stopped and came over. 

“Daniel?”

Her voice was very hushed when she spoke. I opened my eyes carefully, not wanting to anger the headache. I was met with her sympathetic expression. It contrasted the now cold living room. Without the sunlight things got pretty cold at night, it was mid October after all.

“How are you feeling?”

She asked.

“Alright, it’s cold though.”

My voice was stiff and breaky, not to mention how dry my mouth was. I licked my lips but this only made me realize how thirsty I was. 

“I’ll get a fire going, doesn’t that sound nice?”

She leaned down and whispered.

“Let’s spend some quality time together before I go.”

I smiled and let out a quiet chuckle before sitting up.

“Sounds lovely.”

I felt like shit but her sweet talking had made things just a little better. She stood up and turned away to the fireplace, grabbing a starter log and tossing it in. As I wobbled to my feet and walked out I could hear the flick of a lighter. I made my way to the kitchen and opened the same cabinet I saw her grab the other cups from. I grabbed one out and brought it to the sink, filling it up and lifting my head to look out the window. It was nearly dark outside now, I thought how could I have been asleep for that long? I was feeling completely fine before that. I stood in the kitchen finishing my water. From the living room I could hear the fire crackling. It motivated me to put the glass down and go enjoy the warmth. Caspurr must have realized there was a fire going because he stepped away from his food bowl and trotted out the kitchen. I followed and sure enough, we ended up in the living room together. There, I saw Jane, sitting down on the carpet in front of the fireplace across from the couch with Caspurr curled up in her lap. She looked perfect. Her face was warmly lit by the fire and her hair was draped across her neck and shoulders, partially skewing the view of her face. She looked up at me and spoke in a hushed tone. 

“Come, sit.”

She patted the ground next to her and I walked over before sitting down and wrapping my arm around her. The house was quiet aside from the sound of Caspurr purring and the fire crackling. 

“This is nice.”

I said softly. After a couple minutes of enjoying the fire she leaned over and rested her head on my shoulder, craning her neck up and bringing her face to my ear. 

“Let’s go upstairs.”

She said. 

One thing led to another and the next thing I remember was waking up in the middle of the night in her bed, I could feel her laying next to me, against me. That’s not all though. I was laying on my side with my back facing her and I could also feel pressure on the side of my neck. It was her hand, it felt kind of like she was trying to check my pulse. As I was mustering up the courage to say something I felt her hand pull away as she laid back down. I tried to brush it off and closed my eyes, not long after I ended up falling asleep again. 

When I woke up in the morning I could hear Jane shuffling around in the room. I sat up and stretched, looking towards the end of the bed. I saw her, kneeling on the ground sorting through piles of clothes. Next to her was an opened suitcase, the only thing in it was a pair of shoes and a zip up bag. I could hear her muttering to herself intermittently. Once she realized I was awake she smiled brightly. 

“Good morning!” 

She said excitedly before holding up two dresses.

“Which one.”

I paused and thought for a moment before pointing to the dress on my right. A long blue and black flowy one. She turned the dress over and gave it another look before folding it and placing it in her suitcase. I yawned and stood up.

“What time is it?”

I asked curiously. 

“Almost eleven, why?”

She replied.

“Oh shit! Shit…”

I quickly threw on my clothes and began to grab up all of my belongings.

“What’s wrong?”

She asked, a bit nervously.

“I have work at eleven thirty!”

I sputtered out, stepping into my shoes and hurrying out the door.

“Wait!” I heard her shout from behind me. 

Reluctantly I paused and turned to her. 

“Im leaving at five to catch my flight. I’ll leave a key for you under the mat. Caspurr’s food is in the cabinet under the sink and there's a watering can on the patio.”

She listed off a bit of information and I nodded with each statement, making an effort to remember what she had said. I turned my back to her and stepped forward, she grabbed my arm. I was more annoyed this time but that quickly dissipated as she grabbed my face, turned it towards her, and kissed me. It was genuine and passionate. She pulled away and spoke softly. 

“I’ll see you soon.”

I nodded and echoed her statement before smiling and making my way through the hall and down the stairs. I grabbed my coat off the hook and opened the front door, stepping out and walking over to my car. I got in and tossed my phone on the dash. As I was pulling out of the driveway I could hear it vibrate and the screen lit up. In the reflection of the windshield I could see the name displayed on my phone. “Natalie” my girlfriend. But I couldn’t see what the text said. I know, I'm a piece of shit and a liar, anything you have to say about me is warranted. I have no excuse or justification, people fuck up. Trust me, it’s now my biggest regret. 

Once I arrived at work I pulled out my phone and responded to her “where have you been, I miss you.” text. I replied with something along the lines of, “Sorry, I’ve just been busy lately.” 

My shift was nearly over now, it was now almost six. Things were pretty slow so I decided to check my phone, not like anyone was around to tell me not to. I had gotten a text that I missed the notification for, It was Jane. The text read, “Just boarded the plane, send me lots of Caspurr pictures!!! :)” I chuckled and responded. “Yes ma’am lol” 

A couple minutes later my shift was over. I clocked out, went home, and packed an overnight bag for Jane’s place. Her house was actually eight minutes closer to where I worked than my house, so I figured I might as well just stay at her place. Besides, there's nothing waiting for me back at home and I was kind of avoiding my girlfriend, if you couldn’t tell. She didn’t live far from where I did. I threw my bag in the backseat of my car and drove over to Jane’s. 

Once I got there I walked up to the door and bent down to grab the key under the doormat, thankfully it was there. I picked it up, unlocked the door, and stepped inside, locking the door behind me. The house was completely silent and cold. It felt kind of weird being here without her, but as Caspurr trotted up to me and rubbed his head against my pant leg I felt just a bit more comfortable. I crouched down to pet him and he bumped his face into my palm, demanding more attention. I caved, picking him up and holding his thin body in my arms. He’s an older cat, despite that he was still spunky and playful; I have to admit I was growing quite fond of the little guy.

I passed by the couch on the way to the living room and set him down before walking over to the fireplace and getting a fire started. I know I could tolerate the cold but I wanted to make sure Caspurr felt comfortable. Once the fire began to crackle he hopped off the couch and laid down on the carpet. I smiled down at him before pulling out my phone and taking a picture. Immediately I sent it to Jane. She replied with a simple “<3” Followed with “Check the fridge ;)” I went to the kitchen and pulled the fridge open. Sitting on the shelf in front of me was a plate of spaghetti wrapped in cling film, on it was a note that read “Dinner for one.”

I chuckled and grabbed the plate before setting it down on the counter. I pulled the cling film off and walked it over to the microwave. I put it in for a minute, once it was done the timer beeped loudly, breaking the near dead silence. It was a little unsettling being alone in a house that wasn’t mine. It took a minute of me searching for the silverware drawer before I was actually  able to eat, I didn't remember where Jane had gotten them from earlier.

 Looking back on it I should have realized how spotty my memory was at the time. I did end up finding what I was looking for and was able to eat. I set my food down on the kitchen island and was about to start eating when I caught a glimpse of Caspurr’s bowl, it was empty. I did remember where Jane told me his food was, I walked over to the sink, bent down, and reached for the stack of cans. I grabbed one, shut the cabinet, and Caspurr came trotting in; his tail held high. He definitely recognized the sound as meaning that he was about to get fed. He waited impatiently by his bowl, not meowing, just staring at me. He wasn't very vocal, I actually haven’t heard him meow once. I opened the can and dumped its contents into the dish. He ducked his head down and immediately began eating. I smiled and walked over to the kitchen island, sitting down at the seat across from the window and looking out. My food was still warm enough to enjoy. Not only that but the beautiful view out the window made things feel serene, the solar lights out in the garden illuminated the plants in a mystical way. It outlined the various types of flora, Jane mentioned previously how passionate she was about gardening. The yard was full of flowers and herbs, the most notable were these beautiful white trumpet shaped flowers that grew up and around the fencing to her yard.

The spaghetti was delicious, I finished the plate pretty quickly. I thought it must have been loaded with pepper though, there were these grainy black specks in the sauce, but it didn’t taste very peppery. 

A couple minutes passed of me scrolling on my phone through social media before I decided to get up and wash my plate. 

As I stood I felt the strangest sensation. I was stationary, leaning against the counter, but it felt as if I had taken a step away from my body. My vision pulsed and swelled with light, everything seemed so much brighter. I felt myself falling and suddenly I was on my knees. I thought I saw Caspurr walk past me, but when I focused my vision I didn’t see him. I walked into the living room, despite the fire the temperature was the exact same as what it was in the kitchen. I made my way over to the couch and I could have sworn I bumped into something stationary and solid, but when I checked my surroundings there was nothing there. I threw myself down onto the couch, it hurt. It felt solid and cold, not like how it was before. As my eyes shut I thought I had heard the sound of distant meowing, a twinge of worry swelled in me as I began thinking that Caspurr could have gotten into something and needed help. I couldn’t bring myself to stand, something in me demanded not to. 

At some point I must have passed out, I don’t remember being tired. When I awoke I was met with the sight of bright light and white tiles. I was laying on the kitchen floor, huddled underneath the island. At the time I knew for a fact that I had gotten up and went into the living room, I was so sure of it. Looking back I recall the sensation of how hard and uncomfortable the couch felt, and how cold everything was; I don’t think I actually ever left the kitchen. My body felt stiff and rigid as I sat up. After taking a moment to think and rationalize what could have happened I figured that what I was experiencing were withdrawal symptoms. At the beginning of October I had stopped abusing prescription medication completely, cold turkey. It was really hard at first, I wanted nothing more than to fall back into the cycle. There were a few slip ups now and then but nothing monumental, I was always told healing isn’t linear. 

This felt different though. I chalked it up to the fact that I hadn't used since the day before Jane and I started talking, maybe my body was just getting everything out of its system. 

Slowly and carefully I rose to my feet, using the island to balance myself. I could hear my heart beat thumping in my aching head. Fortunately the headache was only minor this time and quickly subsided. I looked down, seeing that my plate was still on the island, but it was not where I left it. My chair was pulled out and my plate now sat on the opposite side of the counter, far from where I was sitting when I ate. I thought that was odd but I must have moved it, there was no one else in the house but me after all. 

I washed my plate, put it in the dish rack, and glanced over at the clock display on the oven. It was past midnight. I was out for nearly five hours, it only felt like a blink of time though. 

“Jesus…” I muttered to myself. I had work again tomorrow at eleven thirty, I should definitely call it a night. With that I made my way upstairs, carrying my overnight bag with me. There was a spare bedroom across the hall. I figured it would probably be best to sleep there rather than in Jane’s bed; that just seemed weird. I threw my bag down on the floor next to the bed, leaving the door open so Caspurr could come cuddle with me if he felt like it; figured the little fella might get lonely since his owner was away. The fire in the living room had long died down, so I figured it didn't need to be tended to anymore. As I laid down on the bed I pulled my phone out and checked for notifications. I had one from Jane and three from my girlfriend. The one from Jane read, “Hope things are going well! I’ll be home before you know it ^_^” 

I smiled and began to type up a response. “All is well, can’t wait to see you again. Goodnight.”

My phone buzzed and another text from Natalie popped up. “Where have you been, you seem so distant lately.” The other three from her were similar. All something along the lines of. “I'm free this weekend.” or  “We should make plans.” We have been dating for almost a year now, and didn't live together but before I met Jane I was spending almost every night over at her house. Before I could type up a response my phone began to ring, it was Natalie. I answered and heard her voice on the other end. 

“Hey.” She said flatly.

“Hey, what’s up?” I responded

“I miss you.” She spoke again after a short break of silence. 

“I miss you too, sorry about not making time to spend with you.” It was true, I really did feel guilty.

“Nah it’s alright, I get it. But hey, I'm free this Friday; we should go grab dinner.” Her voice was soft and poignant.

“That would be great. I’ll find a nice spot and send you the address, let’s meet there.” That was the plan I had come up with, I couldn’t avoid her forever. 

“Awesome, sounds like a plan…I love you.” She spoke again, this time more gingerly. 

“I love you too, see you friday.” My voice lowered as our conversation ended, she hung up and I tossed my phone on the nightstand. Friday was a ways away, today was only monday. Technically now Tuesday since it was past midnight. 

A pit of guilt and remorse began to form deep in my chest the longer I thought about what I was doing. How I was sleeping at Jane’s while my girlfriend was missing me more and more. I know I should have prioritized her, I really wished I would have. None of this would have happened if I just remained faithful to Natalie. 

Eventually I was able to drift off to sleep, the first night alone at Jane’s was relatively uneventful. I slept through the whole night, only waking up once early in the morning as a result of Caspurr cuddling up to my face. The both of us fell asleep and didn’t wake again until my alarm went off at ten AM. Caspurr was no longer in the bed with me, I wasn't surprised. He was probably in the kitchen waiting for breakfast. However, as I stood up I noticed that the bedroom door was now shut. It gave me a weird feeling but I figured it must have been Caspurr’s doing. I opened the door and began my path to the kitchen, through the hall, then down the stairs, and through the living room. Eventually I ended up in the kitchen where I was met with the sight of Caspurr sitting by his bowl. I couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight. Before making myself coffee I grabbed his food from under the sink and emptied the can into his bowl. He looked up at me and wiggled his tail, I think it was a sign of gratitude. 

It took a good five minutes of me digging through the cabinets until I found the coffee Jane mentioned I was welcomed to. And then another five figuring out how to work the fancy coffee pot, eventually it was ready. I stood staring out the window sipping my coffee for what only felt like a couple minutes. I ended up glancing over at the time on the oven clock and it read ten fifty five. 

“Damn!” 

How could that much time have passed? I didn’t think that was possible until I looked down at Caspurr’s bowl and saw that it was completely empty, my mug was as well. It felt like I had just started drinking it. At the time I just disregarded all that and focused on the fact that I had to get to work or else I was going to be late. I rushed out the door, hurriedly locking it behind me; putting the key in my back pocket. I sped out the driveway and rushed to work. It was a fifteen minute drive but I got there faster than I thought I would. Once I made my way into the building I clocked in and took a seat at my desk. As I sat the chair squeaked, it sounded eerily similar to a meow. 

Hours passed and before I knew it my shift was over. It was now five thirty five. It took me a bit longer to get my things together today but I did end up making my way over to Jane’s house. I was feeling hesitant about staying the night there but I at least wanted to go over and check up on Caspurr. So I did. I pulled up into the driveway and made my way to the front door, reached into my back pocket for the key and-... It wasn’t there. I panicked for a bit and began quickly checking my other pockets. I did find it. But it was in my front left pocket. I distinctly recall putting it in my back pocket, why would my brain have made that up? 

After I entered the house I realized that it was freezing cold inside, nearly the same temperature it was outside. I rushed over to the fireplace and got a fire going, next I began searching for Caspurr; I wanted to make sure he was alright, I did eventually find him curled up under a blanket in Jane’s bed. He stretched and followed me out to the kitchen, I would feed him and then leave after that. After cleaning and refilling his food and water dishes I noticed my mug from this morning was sitting in the dish drain, clean. I did not wash it before I left for work. At least, I didn’t remember washing it.

 It honestly freaked me out. I did more research online, trying to verify what I thought in my head; and some of the weird things I had been experiencing were consistent with the symptoms of withdrawal. I didn’t want my paranoia to get the best of me so I just decided to ride it out. 

 I wish I hadn’t. 

I licked my lips and realized that my mouth was extremely dry. I remember Jane offering me sweet tea the first night we spent at her house; at the time I denied her offer but now it sounded tempting. I figured it was still in the fridge. I checked and low and behold, there it was. Full and sitting on the bottom shelf. I poured myself a full glass and sat at the kitchen island, sipping it and scrolling on my phone. Caspurr finished his food and trotted out of the kitchen, making his way towards the warmth emanating from the living room. I began to follow him, but I heard something, a meow. It wasn’t coming from the living room though, it came from outside the window. It sounded muffled, like it was coming from a bit of a distance. My head turned towards the window but my body didn’t move.

 “It’s just a stray cat.” I told myself, trying to rationalize. I tried to ignore it and walked into the living room and joined Caspurr- who was sitting on the rug in front of a fireplace. I sat next to him and reached up to the end table and switched the tv on to a random channel. A sitcom was playing and I immediately changed it, the laugh tracks always creeped me out. I ended up deciding on some nature channel. After an hour or so of watching TV I decided to order takeout, the only thing open at this time was a Chinese restaurant. I scrolled through the menu and placed my order.

About fifteen minutes later I heard a knock at the door, I opened it and my food was there…just sitting on the front doorstep tied up in a grocery bag. I peeked my head out and looked around but there was no one in sight. I shrugged it off and picked up the food, brought it inside, and sat down on the couch to eat. 

I finished and decided it was time to head out, the fire had been going long enough to keep things adequately warm for Caspurr to be comfortable for the night. I didn't want to leave any of the space heaters running while I wasn't here. As I stood up to snuff out the fire I heard a knock at the door. I jumped, I wasn't expecting anyone at this time. I was hesitant to open it so I peeked out the window to see who it was, it was the delivery man. I felt my heat sink into my stomach and an overwhelming sense of dread flooded my system. My stomach turned over with nausea and anxiety. Reluctantly, I opened the door and was greeted by the person on the other side. After that it felt as if everything had happened so quickly. 

“I’m sorry, I think there's been a mix up. My food was already delivered.” 

The delivery guy looked confused.

“This is 357 Oakwood?” He asked.

I nodded slowly and reached my hand out, grabbing the food that was being handed to me. I nervously thanked him and closed the door behind me as I walked into the living room. What I saw made my blood run cold. The now empty to-go boxes I was eating out of that were sitting on the coffee table were gone. My hand opened and locked up, causing the food I was holding to hit the ground. My breath quickened as I sprinted to the kitchen and nearly ripped off the lid of the trashcan to check inside. The only thing in the bag were empty cat food cans. The kitchen lights now seemed violently bright and my head felt as if it were being split in half. I groaned and clamped my palm over my eyes, trying to shield them from the light. I could hear the TV playing loudly, a deafening laugh track echoing throughout the whole house. I tried to step back but stumbled, tripping over my own feet. I felt my back hit the tile, hard, it knocked the wind out of me. I don’t fully remember what I was thinking at the time, I just recall trying to shout for help, but no words were coming from my mouth, just gasps. I could hear Caspurr meowing repeatedly from behind me, it sounded like he was on top of my head. I threw an arm out, trying to reach for him, but I couldn't feel anything; just tile. 

I passed out again, this time when I woke up the sun was just starting to rise. I didn’t wake up in the kitchen though, I awoke in a cold sweat on the living room floor. I didn’t even bother trying to sit up, I just laid there on the ground for a moment, trying to make sense of what was happening to me. Eventually I did get up, noticing that the fire was no longer burning. I assumed that it just fizzled out, probably for the best anyway if I wasn't there to tend to it. I inspected my surroundings further and realized that the tv was still on, playing a nature channel. I felt a chill run down my spine. I swallowed hard, turned the tv off, went to the kitchen to feed Caspurr, and rushed out the house. I locked the door behind me and got in my car, gripping the steering wheel tightly. I sat there in silence for a while as the sun rose. 

After a while I decided to call Natalie. It was seven AM but I thought maybe she would still pick up…she didn’t. I sat alone in my car for a few more minutes before pulling out of the driveway and heading home. It was about a twenty minute drive from my house to Jane’s. Once I made it to my apartment and basically threw myself through the door, slamming it behind me. My body ached, probably because I had ended up sleeping, or rather passing out, on the floor so many times. I checked my phone again, there was a notification; it was from Jane. It read, “Don’t forget to water my plants please!” 

Shit, I had completely forgotten. I took a seat on the couch and replied with something along the lines of, “Yep, thanks for the reminder.” There was no way in hell I was going back to that house at that moment, I'd just do it after work.

Eventually it was time for me to head out, eleven fifteen, and I made my way to work. Another pretty uneventful day, things went smoothly and the shift rolled by at a regular pace. I thought the stress of detox and house sitting was just starting to weigh on me, spending some time at my own place really helped relieve some of the anxiety I had building up. I clocked out, got in my car, and drove over to Jane’s. About half way there I decided to smoke a cigarette, I hadn't done that in a while, I was trying to ween off it a bit; just another drop of vice in my ocean of bad habits. I didn’t realize until I began to smoke it that the paper of the cigarette was crinkled, not to mention the tobacco was loosely packed in there compared to the others. As I was pulling up to the stoplight I decided to snuff it out after a couple puffs. When I looked up again I almost began to cry. I was now sitting in Jane’s driveway. 

“What the fuck…. WHAT THE FUCK!” 

I could feel myself trembling uncontrollably and my voice sounded distant. I have absolutely no recollection of the rest of the drive there. I just blinked and suddenly… I was at Jane’s house. I didn’t know what to do, how does someone even begin to handle a situation like that. After a bout of panic and hyperventilating eventually I stepped out of my car, knees feeling weak and atrophied. Each step I took towards the garden felt like it took years to complete. 

“Water plants, feed Caspurr, turn on the heater, go home.”

I repeated this phrase out loud to myself over and over as I carefully stepped around potted plants and raised garden beds. Next thing I knew I was standing on her patio, looking down at two watering cans. Deciding which one to use felt like such a heavy decision for me to make, they were both nearly identical, one looking slightly more used than the other. I bent down, aiming to grab the older looking one. When I wrapped my fingers around the handle I felt my skin brush against itself, I focused on what I was doing and realized that I was making a fist; empty handed. 

“Wha-” 

The word was shallow and breathy, echoing throughout my head. I winced and looked up at the sky, the sun was beginning to set now. Before looking down again I repeated the phase I tried to burn into my memory. 

“Water plants, feed Caspurr, turn on the heater, go home.”

When I looked down again I felt another fit rising inside me. There was only one watering can. Because of the position I was in when I attempted to stand I fell flat on my ass. It took a bit of me scrambling around on the concrete but eventually I was able to make it to my feet, but when I stood up again and blinked I was now laying on the ground. I didn’t remember falling down again. Not only that, but my whole body screamed with aches. It felt as if I had just run a marathon. Upon further inspection my arms and legs were full of bruises. The more my senses came to the more I realized that something was very very wrong. It wasn’t light outside anymore, the only thing illuminating the space around me was a flood light mounted above the back door. There was a chill in the air, I shivered and realized that I was wet, my pants were wet; as if I had sat in a puddle. I opened my mouth to say something but couldn’t. My mouth was bone dry. I brought a hand up to my lips and realized that there was crusted drool streaking down the side of my face.I must have been laying there for hours, I didn’t know what time it was, all I knew was that it was dark; and cold. It’s hard to recall exactly what I did at that moment but I do remember crying and grasping at the ground, making some attempt to hold onto the reality that was slipping away from me.

I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t call my girlfriend and ask her to come pick me up from my mistress's house because I was experiencing some psychological break. So I called Kevin instead. He is one of my very few friends, I met him back in college before I dropped out. He knew I was cheating on Natalie with Jane and made it blatantly clear that he did not approve. But I was there for him during his hard times, so I assumed he would be there for me. I gave him a call and thanked god whenever he picked up the phone and I heard his voice on the other end.

“Yo, Daniel, I haven't heard from you in a minute. What’s up?” 

“I need some help man. I need you to come get me” My voice was hoarse and shaky.

I could hear him smack his lips and sigh.

“You at that girl’s house huh?” He sounded like a disappointed parent. 

“Y-Yeah… I think I need to go to the hospital.”

His tone quickly shifted 

“What’s the address, I'm heading over now.”

“357 Oakwood.”

We said our goodbyes and hung up. I didn’t know how far away his house was from Jane’s but it felt like he got there pretty quickly. I could see him pull up in the driveway from behind the house and I walked over to his car, getting in the passenger seat. As I closed the door I could see his face scrunch up, like he smelled something sour. He looked at me, down at my lap, and then back up to my face. 

“You alright man?”

I didn’t say anything to him. I just shook my head no. His expression changed to concerned and sympathetic.

“What’s going on?”

“I think I might be going insane or, or something.”

My voice broke as I spoke to him.

He didn’t say anything in regards to that but I felt his hand squeeze my shoulder. I leaned my head back against the headrest, closing my eyes. I figured he didn't question me much at the time because he was all too familiar with my past struggle with addiction.",2,1765185616.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

About three weeks ago I started feeling sick after my morning coffee. Dizzy. Nauseous. My hands shake. I thought maybe I was stressed from work or getting the flu.

Two days ago I came home early. My wife was in the kitchen standing over my coffee mug. She had a small bottle with no label and was pouring powder into it. When she heard me she shoved the bottle in her pocket and said it was a new coffee flavor she was trying.

Her voice was shaking. She wouldn't make eye contact.

That night I asked her directly what she put in my coffee. She said it was a natural supplement to help me feel better but couldn't tell me what it was or why there was no label.

I told her I need space and asked her to stay at her mother's house for a few days. She cried and said I'm overreacting and don't trust her. She left.

Now she's texting constantly saying it was harmless and I'm making a huge deal over nothing.

I kept the bottle. I'm too afraid to test it myself. I love her but I'm scared she's been poisoning me.

1ph7z43,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1ph7z43/i_turned_howard_schultzs_starbucks_philosophy/,"I turned Howard Schultz's Starbucks philosophy into AI prompts and learned to build experiences, not just products","I was impressed and inspired by Howard Schultz's story of building Starbucks and realized his experience-first mindset translates perfectly to AI prompting. It's like having the guy who convinced America to pay $5 for coffee consulting on your brand:

**1. ""What's the third place experience I'm really selling?""**

Schultz's revelation that Starbucks wasn't selling coffee, but the space between home and work. AI reframes what you're actually offering. 

>""I'm launching a coworking space. What's the third place experience I'm really selling?"" 

You stop thinking about desks and start thinking about belonging.

**Complete Prompt For Example:** (You can create such prompts for all)

```
You are Howard Schultz, founder of Starbucks, who revolutionized the coffee industry by understanding that you weren't selling coffee—you were selling the ""third place"" experience between home and work. You have a genius for identifying the deeper emotional and social need that a business fulfills beyond its obvious product or service.

CONTEXT:
I'm launching a boutique fitness studio that offers 45-minute HIIT classes. My target market is busy professionals aged 28-45 who live within 3 miles of my location in a mid-sized city. Currently, I'm positioning myself as ""convenient, effective workouts for busy people."" I charge $35 per class or $280/month for unlimited. My main competitors are Orange Theory, local gyms, and Peloton at-home workouts.

I'm struggling to differentiate myself beyond ""we have good instructors and it's near your house."" My marketing feels transactional—I'm listing features (heart rate monitors, shower facilities, class times) but not connecting emotionally.

INSTRUCTION:
Analyze my business through your ""third place"" lens. What am I really selling beyond the workout itself? What emotional, social, or psychological need am I fulfilling? What's the experience people are actually craving when they show up to a fitness class at 6am or 7pm?

Help me understand:
1. What ""third place"" role could my fitness studio play in people's lives?
2. What feelings or needs am I addressing that have nothing to do with burning calories?
3. How should this deeper understanding change my messaging, my studio design, and my customer experience?
4. What's my equivalent of Starbucks creating ""the space between home and work""?

Think the way you did when you realized Starbucks wasn't competing with Folgers—it was competing with loneliness, routine, and the lack of community gathering spaces in American life.
```

**Why This Prompt Works:**

Role clarity: AI embodies Schultz's specific genius for experience design

Rich context: Gives AI enough detail to provide specific, actionable insights

Problem statement: Makes clear what's not working with current approach

Structured instruction: Breaks down exactly what you need answered

Philosophical anchor: Reminds AI of the core insight that made Schultz successful

**2. ""How do I make people feel, not just what do I sell them?""**

His obsession with emotional connection over transactions. 

> ""I run a financial planning business. How do I make people feel, not just what do I sell them?"" 

AI shifts you from spreadsheets to security, from ROI to peace of mind.

**3. ""What would this look like if I designed it for romance, not efficiency?""**

Schultz chose Italian espresso bar ambiance over fast food speed. AI helps you find your version. 

> ""I'm building a productivity app. What would this look like if I designed it for romance, not efficiency?"" 

Suddenly you're thinking about ritual, not just task completion.

**4. ""Where am I cutting corners that customers actually notice?""**

His principle of premium quality in every detail. 

> ""Here's my customer journey [describe it]. Where am I cutting corners that customers actually notice?"" 

AI spots the paper-cup moments that undermine your premium positioning.

**5. ""What story am I telling that makes people want to be part of something?""**

Schultz built community, not a customer base. 

> ""I sell sustainable clothing. What story am I telling that makes people want to be part of something?"" 

AI elevates you from merchant to movement.

**6. ""If this were a daily ritual, what would make it irreplaceable?""**

Starbucks became a habit, not a choice. 

> ""I have a newsletter. If this were a daily ritual, what would make it irreplaceable?"" 

Forces you to think about integration into identity, not just content delivery.

**The breakthrough:** Schultz took a commodity product and made it premium through experience design. AI helps you find your coffee-to-Starbucks transformation.

**Schultz's employee insight:** ""How do I treat my team so they'll treat customers the way I envision?"" His famous partner benefits philosophy. 

> ""I'm building a service company. How do I treat my team so they'll treat customers the way I envision?"" 

AI maps the internal culture that creates external magic.

**Advanced technique:** Combine sensory and emotional. 

> ""What should customers see, hear, smell, and feel when they interact with my brand? How does each sense reinforce the story?"" 

AI builds your complete sensory experience blueprint.

**The consistency test:** 

> ""I'm successful in location A. How do I replicate this experience in location B without losing the magic?"" 

Schultz's scaling challenge as a prompt. AI spots what's essential versus what's circumstantial.

I've used these actionable prompts and also tried, detailed version with role, context and instructions for product positioning, customer journey design, and brand voice development. 

**Secret weapon:** 

> ""My competitor offers the same thing cheaper/faster. What's my version of 'we're not in the coffee business serving people, we're in the people business serving coffee'?"" 

AI finds your philosophical differentiation when features aren't enough.

**Reality check:** Experience obsession can become expensive theater. Add 

""what's the minimum viable version of this experience that still delivers the emotional benefit?"" to stay profitable.

**The comeback prompt:** 

> ""I've lost my way and become transactional. How do I return to my original experience vision?"" 

Schultz literally did this twice at Starbucks. AI helps you find your way back.

1ph7vr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazingStories/comments/1ph7vr9/the_little_things_my_wife_does_that_i_never/,The little things my wife does that I never noticed until recently,"I don’t know if it’s age, or just life slowing down a bit, but lately I’ve been noticing stuff my wife has been doing for years… little things I somehow kept missing. And honestly, it hit me harder than I expected.

Like the way she always brews enough coffee for me even on days she’s running late. She doesn’t say anything, doesn’t leave some cute sticky note — just quietly makes sure my mug is full before she heads out. And I never really paid attention to it. I just drank the coffee and went on with my day like it magically poured itself.

Or how she always keeps the house feeling like an actual home — not by doing anything big, but by doing those small, invisible tasks you don’t even register. Refilling the soap. Remembering which groceries we’re out of without checking. Rearranging the couch blankets so the place feels cozy when I walk in. Stuff I used to assume “just gets done.”

And then there’s the way she listens. Like… actually listens. I’ll mention something random — a snack I liked as a kid, a movie I haven’t seen in years, a thing I thought about ordering but didn’t — and it shows up days later, like she kept it tucked in her brain just because it mattered to me for two seconds.

These aren’t grand gestures. They’re tiny things. Everyday things. Easy-to-miss things.

But recently I started seeing them for what they actually are:  
**love in the quietest form.**

Love that doesn’t need attention.  
Love that doesn’t ask for credit.  
Love that just… shows up.  
Every day.  
In a hundred tiny ways.

And it made me check myself a little.  
Because I realized how many times she’s been giving without me really noticing. How many moments she’s made easier without saying a word. How much of her heart she’s been pouring into our life in ways I never really thanked her for.

So now I’m trying to pay attention.  
To match the energy.  
To show up in those tiny ways too — not because I “should,” but because I want her to feel the same quiet comfort she gives me every day.

Funny thing is, once you start noticing the little things, you start appreciating the whole relationship differently. It feels warmer. Softer. More solid.

And honestly?  
That’s been the most unexpected, beautiful shift in my life lately.

1ph7v9w,https://i.redd.it/p6jlj4665y5g1.jpeg,Pumpkin Spice Latte Cinnamon Rolls: Irresistible Recipe Secrets,"It’s officially pumpkin spice season, and I’ve found myself obsessed with combining cozy fall flavors into all my baking experiments. These pumpkin spice latte cinnamon rolls are the ultimate mash-up of two of my favorite things: a fluffy cinnamon roll and the warming spices of a pumpkin spice latte. Perfect for a weekend breakfast or brunch with friends! If you want the detailed steps all in one place, I wrote it up here: [https://www.amgroyal.com/pumpkin-spice-latte-cinnamon-rolls](https://www.amgroyal.com/pumpkin-spice-latte-cinnamon-rolls)  
  
For the dough:  
4 cups all-purpose flour  
1 packet (2 1/4 tsp) active dry yeast  
1/4 cup granulated sugar  
1 tsp salt  
1/2 cup whole milk  
1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened  
1/2 cup canned pumpkin puree  
2 large eggs  
  
For the filling:  
1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened  
1/2 cup brown sugar  
2 tsp ground cinnamon  
1 tsp pumpkin pie spice  
  
For the frosting:  
4 oz cream cheese, softened  
1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened  
1 cup powdered sugar  
2–3 tbsp brewed coffee (cooled)  
1–2 tbsp caramel sauce (optional, but highly recommended!)  
  
1. Warm the milk slightly until it’s lukewarm (not hot), then stir in the yeast and let it sit for 5 minutes until foamy.  
2. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Mix in the yeast mixture, butter, pumpkin puree, and eggs. Knead the dough for about 8–10 minutes until smooth and elastic (or use a stand mixer if you’re feeling lazy!). Cover, and let it rise in a warm spot for 1 to 1.5 hours or until doubled in size.  
3. While the dough is rising, prepare your filling by mixing the softened butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice together until smooth.  
4. Once the dough has risen, roll it out into a large rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the filling evenly across the dough. Roll it up tightly from the longer side and cut into 12 equal pieces.  
5. Place the rolls in a greased or parchment-lined baking dish. Cover and let them rise again for about 30 minutes (this step makes them extra fluffy).  
6. Preheat your oven to 350°F and bake the rolls for 20–25 minutes, or until lightly golden. Let them cool slightly.  
7. While the rolls cool, whisk together the frosting ingredients (cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, and coffee). If using caramel sauce, swirl it in for extra indulgence. Spread the frosting over the warm rolls and serve!  
  
\- If you’re short on time, you can make the dough the night before, let it rise in the fridge, and bake in the morning.  
\- For an extra maple vibe, swap out the caramel sauce in the frosting for a drizzle of maple syrup instead—instant pumpkin maple cinnamon rolls!  
\- Leftovers? Reheat them for 10 seconds in the microwave; they’ll taste fresh out of the oven again.  
\- If you’re a latte lover, you can sprinkle a little instant coffee into the filling for a bold cinnamon roll coffee latte experience.

A little bit of back story beforehand. I(28F) have known my boyfriend, Shawn (30M) fake name, since high school. We were good friends until I had to move away at 15. We lost contact after that until he found me on scoail media a few years ago. We lived about an hour and half away from each other, so we started meeting up. At first, we were hanging out catching up about life, but as time went on, the meet ups started getting more intimate and personal. He eventually told me he had a crush on me since HS and he wanted to give ""us"" a try. Also made a point to say how moving away really hurt him, which I was confused by since he was dating someone when I left. Nevertheless, after a few more meet ups, we started dating, because I also had a crush on him too, and from our meet ups, he was still the same, goofy amazing guy he was in HS. Tid bit I should mention also is he NEVER EVER was without his phone. It was always in his hand or near his hands at all times. When it wasn't, it was in his pocket. (The foreshadowing is crazy)

Anyway, it had just passed our year anniversary and Christmas was coming. We made an itinerary for the holiday to make sure we got to go to his family's and to mine. We agreed since I was off Christmas eve, I would drive up to him, spend time with his mom, stay the night and we'd drive together to my city Christmas day to spend time with my family. Welp, Christmas eve came, but I got called in to work but only half a shift, so I let him know I would drive up right after I got off. He was fine with it and that was that. Riiight?

Anywho, I text him when I got off work, no reply. I went home, showered, changed and text him I was headed his way, no reply. I drive the hour and a half to his house and text him I made it safe, no reply. His roommate let me in because surprise, he wasn't there. That's when I call him. No answer. I wait about 30 minutes and try again, no answer. The roommate has to leave for work and tells me if I leave and my bf still isn't answering just text him so he can buzz me back in. He gave me his number and left. I call again, no answer. At this point it's getting dark outside and I'm starting to worry. I text him that I'm worried since he's not answering and if he is reading this he needs to reply or call me now. Still nothing. I call his mom and ask if she's seen him, she pauses and said, ""nope."" She says she'll try to call when we get off. Before that, I apologized to her for not coming over to visit with her today, but I was waiting for him so we could go together. She tells me its fine and she'll just see us tomorrow.

Welp, after a few more calls and texts he finally picks up the phone about 1045pm. He tells me, hes in a city about 40 minutes away, he went with John, who ive never heard of or met, and I know all his friends, How they are on the side of the road because the tire is flat with no spare. I offer to come pick him up, he says no, they called AAA. I ask him why he hasn't responded all day, he says he didnt have his phone on him and also it was powered off most of the day. To which I said, ""you knew we had plans and you also knew I was coming today, why did you leave?"" Now all the sudden he has to hurry and get off the phone and hung up on me. I call him back, and it goes straight to VM.

When I tell you this man really had me sitting and waiting for him until the next morning. I woke up on the couch and he still wasnt back. I get my keys and start to leave because now I went from worried to pissed. As Im pulling out, hes pulling up. He blocks my car in and starts begging me to come back inside and ""talk."" I say no he needs to move. He doesnt move his car until I turn my car off. We walk inside and he gives me this long drawn out story about the ""events"" of the prior night. I absolutely went off on him because idgaf what happen. You shouldve said something to me. Don't ignore me all day AFTER I drove an hour and a half JUST to spend tome with you. He apologized and we moved past it and I assumed everything was good now.

Around December 27th or 28th, I get a FB notification that he was tagged in a picture by someone I'm not friends with. Open the notification and what do I see. Yep, you guessed it, him with another woman Christmas tree shopping and taking Christmas ""family phots"" with the girl, her daughter, and the cherry, HIS MOM! I go down her page and FOR 4 MONTHS there's a BUNCH of pictures of them together, videos of her making her daughter call him daddy, and a bunch of status saying how lucky she is to have found her person. I. WAS. FLOORED. Throughout our relationship, he never gave any hints of cheating, was never not affectionate, always answered calls or texts, came to events I had, we did things together, all of it.

I screenshot everything, I messaged her and let her know we had been dating for over a year and since he was with her now, she didn't need to worry about me. She can have him. I sent him the screenshots and blocked him on everything. 

After about a week, I get a text from a random number. Remember when the roommate and I exchanged numbers? Yeah, he was using the roommate's phone to text me begging to meet up to talk. I was still pretty pissed and had no intention of getting back with him, but I still wanted to hear what he had to say so we met at a coffee shop. He starts by apologizing and saying the girl let him read the message I sent her and how he was grateful that I was ""gracious"" with her and didnt attack her in my message to her. He's always loved that about me, and how he really adored the fact I was such a nice person. How that was one of the reasons he was so attracted to me etc. He goes on to say this sob story about his childhood and how he became a player in HS because of it, so when things started to get serious between us, he had to ""make sure all the player was out of his system!"" So he could focus on me only. He finished up by saying that I was a really good friend to him and he always wanted to keep my friendship even though right now, it was really hard for me to forgive him.

Through all of this I stayed silent and just let him talk, but when he brought up friendship, all bets were off. I told him that I was a dang good friend and I will continue to be, to my friends. However, a friend would never put me in this position so he was no friend to me. I dont want the friendship he has to offer. Thats when he started looking sad and trying to give me the puppy eyes, so I said we can give our relationship another try BUT only if I slept with his dad. His dad is dead BTW. He starts scream crying in the middle of the coffee shop, calling me evil and saying how he wished he never met me. I just got up and walked out leaving him there crying. 

His mom called me later that day, but I ignored and blocked her too. I blocked the roommate and anybody else that he had access to that had access to me. I was talking to my sister about it and she said the dad comment was too far. Was it, or did he have it coming?",30,1765184631.0,ComfortLevelPod,24,0.73,False

* Personal shoppers independientes. 
* Cocineros para eventos privados. 
* Tramitadores de importaciones. 
* Peluqueros a domicilio sin local.

Todos ellos comparten algo: desarrollan actividades legítimas que el sistema clasificatorio tradicional no contemplaba específicamente.

Aquí es donde entra el IAE 599 

Este epígrafe actúa como paraguas protector para ""Otros Profesionales Relacionados con Comercio y Hostelería"".

Pero la verdadera estrategia está en el siguiente nivel:

La elección del CNAE correcto te permite: 

→ Optimizar cotizaciones (diferencias de hasta 0,75% en AT) 

→ Acceder a deducciones específicas del sector

 → Cumplir requisitos para subvenciones dirigidas

 → Facilitar la obtención de financiación bancaria

El truco está en analizar tu facturación real:

* ¿Qué servicio genera más ingresos?
* ¿Trabajas más con empresas o particulares?
* ¿Prestas servicio directo o intermedias?

Tu código CNAE debe reflejar tu realidad económica, no tu aspiración.

My gf and I were working in Starbucks Shangri-La just today and encountered something unsavory (in my opinion at least).

As we were working there, may nag-sit sa tabi namin na dalawa, one guy(…?) and a girl. Nung una, they were normal convo, nothing out of the ordinary as far as coffee shop interactions go. Then out of nowhere, from the corner of my eye may nakita akong parang usok. I had to do a double take just to make sure na tama yung nakita ko. Ito palang si guy(..?) humihipak na ng vape niya, and what’s worse is pinapa-video pa niya for TikTok sa kasama niya. 

I know I’m supposed to mind my own business pero I could smell his funky-ass vape and hindi naman talaga tama from what I know. So nagsabi na ako sa baristas about it. I specified where the person is and even asked if allowed ba (might be a policy I’m not aware of so I had to make sure) to vape inside the store. 

Ang kaso pa is before sila ma-apprehend ng staff or even the baristas, they already left. May lumapit na barista sa akin saying that they has to review their CCTVs and they already reported the incident.

**The idea:** Day Doodle auto-pulls your phone photos from today (or a month/vacation) and turns them into a **one-page doodle collage** with weather icons, calendar events, and cute sketch overlays. Think ""visual diary"" for your home screen.

**How it works (30-sec demo in mind):**

1. Open app → picks your best 5-12 photos from today/month
2. Adds doodle frames + ""Rainy coffee run ☕"" or ""Team offsite ✈️"" overlays
3. One-tap export/share or set as wallpaper (Android auto, iOS save)

**Example:** Your evening doodle shows beach pics + ""Weekend Goa trip 🌴"" banner = instant Instagram story.

**MVP features I'd build:**

* Today + monthly collages
* 2-3 doodle styles (playful/minimal)
* Photos + optional calendar/weather
* Free basic, $4.99 premium (unlimited + no watermark)

**Questions for you:**

1. **Would you use this daily/weekly?** (Yes/No + why)
2. **What would make you pay $5 one-time?** More styles? Year recaps? Custom fonts?
3. **Better as wallpaper app or Instagram export tool?**
4. **Price check:** Too much? Too little?

**Target users:** Photo-heavy people who love Notion aesthetics, bullet journals, or daily Stories.

I’m a 25-year-old guy living in Melbourne and I’m hoping to meet some new people around the city. Most of my current friends have moved away for work or travel, and I’ve realised it’s way harder to make new connections as an adult than I expected — so here I am giving this a shot.

little about me: I’m fairly laid-back, enjoy good conversations, and I love exploring Melbourne’s cafés, bars, and hidden spots. I’m always down for grabbing a drink after work, trying a new place for brunch, or wandering around the city checking out markets and local events. I’m into movies, fitness, gaming, and music, but I’m also open to trying new things if someone brings a good vibe. 

I’m looking for genuine friendships — people who want to chat, hang out, share interests, or even form a small friend group for weekend activities. Doesn’t matter if it’s grabbing coffee, going for a walk, hitting a gig, or just talking about life.

Checked my account $2.15 left and it was only the 23rd. And this is wasn't even the first time this happened either.

I split a 2bed with my roommate about half a mile from campus, Rent's $650/month plus utilities (like $70). Between my part-time gig at the campus bookstore (bringing home around $1,200/month after taxes) and like $400 help from my parents, I start each month with **$1,600 total**. After rent and utilities thats $880 left for literally everything else (food, laundry, going out, whatever). Should be enough right?

I dont have a car so i usually walk everywhere, campus is literally a 10min walk. But week 1-2 when i have money im out here buying impulsive things. daily starbucks before my 9am ($6-7), doordash 3-4x a week cause im too tired to cook (like $22-30 per order). Taking ubers to the grocery store. random convenience store runs for energy drinks and snacks. Week 3 hits and im panicking. Week 4? Living off boxed mac n cheese and ramen, dodging my friends when they wanna grab food cause im broke.

One sunday i sat down and see my bank account where everything went:

* $150 on starbucks (5 days/week)
* $330 on delivery apps
* $110 on random convenience store stuff (energy drinks snacks impulsive buys)
* $50 on laundry (once a week, like $12/week)
* $70 on ubers
* $60 on going out with friends
* $35 on toiletries and random stuff

Thats like $805 out of $880. literally only $75 left and i havent even bought real groceries yet. No wonder i was eating ramen by week 4.

I knew I needed to SEE where my money was going in real time not just panic when my accounts empty. My friend advice me to track my daily spending, using budgeting apps like [iSpend AI](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ispend-ai-money-manager/id6754285869), [Money Manager](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/money-manager-expense-budget/id560481810), etc. So figured id try it.

Main thing that helped me with budgeting app, was seeing how much i have left each day not what i spent. Made me think twice before ordering doordash lol. Set up budget limit for each category too, gave myself like $80/month for coffee so i didnt feel guilty just had to stick to it.

Ngl i'm not suddenly saving hundreds. but now I:

* Get starbucks 2x week instead of daily
* Cook basic stuff most nights, order in maybe once a week
* Budget $120 for groceries which helps a ton
* Have like $100-120 left end of month

1ph7mgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Carpentry/comments/1ph7mgy/carpentry_mental_health/,Carpentry & Mental Health,"I’m 21 and lately I feel like I’m running on fumes. I’m a second-year carpentry apprentice and I work six days a week just trying to get ahead. Money is always tight, but I don’t drink, I don’t do drugs, I don’t go out partying. Every dollar I make goes into tools or something that helps me grow in my trade. Last Sunday at 6pm I was still out buying a $200 tool because that’s the kind of stuff I care about.

I’m disciplined as hell with my routine too. I wake up at 5:30am every day, no matter what job I’m on — close, far, doesn’t matter. It keeps me structured. I meal prep, make my lunch, blend my protein smoothie for the drive, drink my two coffees… but even with all that, I still feel tired all the time. I’m building the “right habits,” but sometimes it just makes me feel like a zombie going through the motions.

And what hits me hardest is how far away my goals feel. I’ve always dreamed of having my own place with a bit of land — something like a small farm in Victoria. Enough space to grow veggies, raise a couple animals, build things, do woodworking, but still close enough to work around Melbourne as a carpenter. But right now it feels miles out of reach.

By the time I get home from work — sometimes after an hour of driving — I’m wrecked. I used to train hard at the gym, lift heavy, feel strong. Now my body’s cooked. My mind says “go train,” but my body wants to collapse on the couch. Then I feel guilty for not doing more. It’s just work → home → recover → repeat.

Weirdly, when I’m doing my own jobs or a Sunday cashie, I actually feel present, almost like myself again. But during the week, it’s like I’m stuck in autopilot.

I live out of home with mates — honestly one of the best decisions I’ve made — but even then, I’m noticing this mindset creeping in where I feel closed off from people. Especially when I’m burnt out. I kind of catch myself seeing people negatively, like I’m always on edge or comparing myself for no reason. I don’t like feeling that way. I’ve hurt people without meaning to just because I’ve been so stressed and tired.

I guess what I’m asking is: for anyone who’s worked physically hard in their early 20s while trying to build a future, how did you push through this stage? How do you stop feeling like a machine and actually feel human again? How do you balance routine, work, saving, and still keep your head in a good place?

Because right now it feels like the dream is so far away, and I’m just hoping someone else has been through this and come out the other side. re in Victoria. Enough space to grow veggies, raise a bit of livestock, do woodwork, build things with my own hands, actually live the kind of life that feels meaningful. But I also want to keep working as a carpenter around Melbourne, which means finding that balance of space without having a brutal commute every day. Feels almost impossible at the moment.

Most days I get home from work after sometimes an hour-long drive and I’m wrecked. I used to go to the gym all the time — lifting heavy, training hard, feeding my ego a bit. Now my body feels cooked after carpentry all day. My brain says “go train,” but my body just wants to collapse on the couch. And then I feel guilty for not doing more.

It’s like my whole life is work → home → recover → repeat.

I guess I’m just wondering how other people get through this stage of life. How do you balance physical work, trying to save money, trying to build a future, and still have enough energy for anything outside of work?

Having driven Zoe's for the last 14 years and always been careful with never going anywhere where I couldn't get home from, or having carefully planned where I could get a charge, and having a granny charger as an emergency back up.

This time, I just jumped into my Volvo and drove from Maidstone to Nottingham for a family Christmas visit - 3 and half hour each way, 372 mile round trip.

Going up, it worked fine - stopped at a service station, plugged it in and by the time had a coffee, it was fully charged. Actually got there in 4 hours.

Home bound it didn't go quite so well - the charger was pinnicky about wanting to charge, and had to had to faff about trying other chargers.

Then having got it charged, back on the motorway my wife and my FIL said they were hungry and wanted to stop to get something to eat.....FFS.... It seemed to take a very long time to get home...

Costs were expensive though....30 quid to charge one way, 35 the other, so 65 quid.....doesn't seem any cheaper than a petrol car...if the mileage charge comes in, that would add another 11 quid.

Starting Weight Loss Medication: Everything You Need to Know
Starting weight loss medication can be an exciting but emotional step. Whether you’re doing it for health reasons, confidence, or quality of life, it’s important to understand what to expect so you can feel prepared, confident, and in control of the process.

These medications work with your body to support appetite control, reduce cravings, and help with feeling fuller for longer. But they are not magic — they are a tool, and when used in combination with lifestyle changes, they can be extremely effective.

Here’s everything you need to know before you begin.

1. What to expect in the first few weeks
The early stage is an adjustment period. Your body is learning a new rhythm with hunger, fullness and digestion.

You may notice:

Reduced appetite

Feeling full quicker than normal

Less interest in food or snacking

Changes in taste or food preferences

Mild nausea or fatigue in the first few days

Slower digestion / feeling fuller for longer

These effects are normal and often settle as your body adapts.

Tip: Don’t panic if you suddenly “don’t feel like eating.” This is common, but your body still needs nourishment, even in small amounts.

2. Why your relationship with food will change
One of the biggest shifts for people is realising they’re no longer driven by constant food thoughts. For the first time in years, “food noise” can quieten.

This can be emotional. You might feel:

Relief

Confusion

Grief for your old habits

A sense of freedom

Or even guilt for not feeling hungry

All of these feelings are normal. This is a psychological change as much as a physical one.

This is a chance to rebuild a healthy relationship with food, without pressure, guilt or shame.

3. What and how much to eat
Even though your appetite may be small, your body still needs nutrients to stay healthy and protected while losing weight.

A simple guide:

Aim for:
✅ Protein
✅ Fibre
✅ Healthy fats
✅ Hydration

Instead of large meals, go for small, balanced plates such as:

Eggs + vegetables

Greek yoghurt + fruit

Soup + lean protein

Small portions of wholegrains

Smoothies when solid food feels difficult

Think “little and often” rather than forcing full-sized meals.

4. Hydration is non-negotiable
Many people mistake thirst for nausea or fatigue on weight loss medication.

You should aim to:

Sip water regularly

Add electrolytes if needed

Avoid too much caffeine

Watch for signs of dehydration such as headaches or dizziness

A simple goal: keep a drink with you at all times.

Hydration also helps reduce side effects and supports fat loss.

5. Movement: What to do and what not to do
You don’t need extreme workouts to lose weight effectively.

The best types of movement during this time are:

Walking

Gentle strength training

Yoga or Pilates

Swimming

Stretching

Avoid:

Overtraining

Very restrictive eating paired with intense exercise

Punishing yourself

The goal is to support your body, not stress it.

6. The emotional side of the journey
As the weight starts to change, emotions can come up.

You may notice:

People treating you differently

Old insecurities surfacing

Fear of regain

Sudden confidence

Or discomfort with change

This is why mindset work is just as important as food.

Helpful practices:

Journalling

Progress photos

Non-scale victories

Talking to supportive people

Therapy or coaching if needed

You are not “cheating” by accepting support. You are healing.

7. Common mistakes to avoid
Many people slow down their progress or feel unwell by doing these:

Skipping all meals completely

Living on coffee or energy drinks

Not getting enough protein

Not moving their body at all

Not addressing emotional eating patterns

This medication is a powerful tool — but you still need to care for yourself.

8. What real success looks like
Real success isn’t just a number on the scale.

It looks like:

✔ More energy
✔ Better sleep
✔ Less joint pain
✔ Better blood pressure / blood sugar
✔ Improved self-confidence
✔ Feeling in control for the first time

This is about long-term change, not quick fixes.

1ph7gtu,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1ph7gtu/struggling_with_family_dynamics/,Struggling with family dynamics,"First time posting and it’s a longggg one so appreciate anyone who has the time to read / skim through and offer some advice!

For back story, SO(31) and I (27) have been together 3 years, living a significant distance from all family members. Discussing engagement within the next 6 months. We have recently moved to same state as BIL. I am not originally from the country, and moved around 4 years ago. I am currently in the process of getting a spouse visa, meaning if this goes to shit I will very likely have to leave everything I’ve built here and return to my home country. 

SO works a high pressure job which involves a lot of working away. His roster includes 1 week of working away, 1 week of being home completely off work. He is essentially gone half the year to rural parts of the country. 

I noticed small signs of enmeshment about a year into the relationship, but because we lived physically away from them, I didn’t know how intense it could get. I’m from an extremely dysfunctional family myself (LC with BPD mom) and only really speak to my siblings, we have a good relationship and text most days / call weekly, with short visits sporadically over the years as we’re all busy. I thought I could have been adjusting due to this but I’m starting to think things aren’t normal.

Here’s a few things which have happened.

-SO would tell me story’s from before we met which all seem heavily family based, he moved interstate for example and MIL(65)/BIL(29) would stay for months on end at his house (he would still leave for work during this time).

-Told me during his time at college, he moved BIL in with him (from home state) on the basis he gets a job/goes to college himself. For the entire year he did neither and financially relied on SO. Eventually they both moved in with SIL(32) before all returning to MIL house/home state during covid. 

-Before SO and I met, he lived in a different state with BIL and some mates. During this time would pay for all BIL living expenses such as groceries and various meals out / drinks ect. BIL did not have a job at this stage.

-MIL also seems to be financially dependent on him. After Covid / lockdowns eased off their grandmother unfortunately died. MIL didn’t want to return to their family home (a fairly big house which would be worth a lot, mortgage fully paid off and fully furnished) due to it being in a more rural location (20 minute drive from city). Since then, she has been renting a 3 bedroom house which SO and SIL pay for. SIL lives elsewhere in same state with a friend. There has been multiple times where money has been short due to this at the end of the month or we’ve had to amend plans and make things stretch. Nothing which would majorly impact our quality of life, but enough to notice. A few canceled dates here and there. SO has a good job, but COL is high where we live and life is so expensive. This arrangement was agreed with them before SO and I met.

Fast forward about 5 years from her initially moving in to this place, MIL is still in the rented house and doesn’t want to leave. She lives there alone, and her actual owned property sits empty. It was actually broken into a few months ago which led to her saying she feels to scared to ever go back, and doesn’t want to rent it out or sell it. This isn’t directly my business, but she also has a fair amount of $ in investments but doesn’t use that money to pay her rent for whatever reason. There’s also been a few times SO has paid for dental appointments for her or covered groceries / fuel. 

We’ve had chats about this moving forward and I’ve made it clear I wouldn’t want to be married to someone whose mother financially relies on him. I of course understand helping occasionally where possible and needed, however think this current situation is ridiculous and not good for anyone. He mildly agrees but nothing has come of it yet (tendency ends around june next year).

-Over the years, MIL has made multiple comments about living with us, with SO making comments too. I’ve made it clear as day that isn’t something I will ever want or welcome, and will end the relationship. 

I do think there’s possibly more than goes on behind the scenes I’m unaware of in terms of them pushing for constant contact. Before we moved apartments/state, we lived in a small studio apartment which was tiny even when it was just me with SO working away. MIL and SIL wanted to visit, which meant they would both somehow have to fit in our extremely small living room for the duration, leaving me to have to step over them in the morning to get ready for work ect. SO understood the issue and suggested a hotel (he gets a 60% discount on most hotels due to work travel), meaning they could save a lot of money and both stay in a bed each. They called the trip off entirely and said they couldn’t afford it. I can’t prove it, but to me it felt like retaliation on SO for suggesting it. If they couldn’t afford a hotel combined, I’m not sure how they would have paid for food/entertainment ect when staying with us. 

- Earlier in the year SO and I went to visit MIL on vacation for me to meet her. It was the most overstimulated I’ve ever been, and we spent literally every single second of a 12 day trip with her. I’m not joking either, from around 9am in the morning till around 11pm most days, she would be with us. Talking every single second.  We decided to do an activity which she didn’t want to do. Said activity was a 2 hour drive away, she decided to come with us. For the entire 4 hours there and back, there wasn’t a single second of silence. She spoke the entire time about anything and everything, and whilst we did the activity she sat in the car by herself. 

SO had a blazing row around day 10 at night  when I finally hit my limit. I wanted to go for a coffee and hike together in the AM to decompress, MIL insisted on coming and due to her mobility we had to cut it short. There wasn’t any compromise or balance the entire trip. He said if he was to say anything MIL would get upset, and gave me the option of him not saying anything or saying something and upsetting her. I didn’t want to risk a sour mood for the remaining trip, so just told him not to say anything. She made odd comments about wanting to come out with us when we went anywhere for her mental health, so I have a feeling she was trying to excuse it.

Whilst she was kind enough to let us stay at her house, she didn’t cook the entire time and SO either cooked or we all went out for food. All expenses including activities, food and gas was covered by me and SO. MIL did not even pretend to reach for her purse once, like it was a given we would pay.

-There’s been times we’ve been out for food together or shopping, BIL has called and they’ve then proceeded to have a 10/15 minute phone call about random things like video games.  This happens frequently.

- A recent incident where he had just got back from a work late at night (11pm), within about 10 minutes of being home BIL was calling asking to visit. I had not seen SO all week and said no, which caused another argument.

- BIL often calls throughout the day/ late into the night for a chat about random things. Sometimes we’ve literally been in bed together with his phone buzzing off.

-BIL insisted on coming furniture shopping with us for our new apartment, they day we got the keys proceeded to stay at ours (in a half empty place!) until around 11.30pm. Only left because SO finally asked him too. Anytime he visits, it will literally be for hours and hours until late into the night. 

-Final straw for me was MIL and SIL deciding to visit for an entire 4 weeks over Xmas season this year. Every year prior to this, he has left me to join them for a week and I have stayed with my brother and his SO for Xmas. SO is also off for the entire 4 weeks they have planned, meaning any time we have together, they will also be here/local. We will now have to celebrate both Xmas eve, Xmas day and New Year’s Eve and day with them. They initially asked to stay with us (they’re visiting from out of state, roughly a 2 hour plane journey). I explained to SO it would make more sense for them to stay with BIL due to his house share having multiple furnished spare bedrooms, vs us having no spare rooms and boxes everywhere which still need unpacking / new puppy (16 weeks) getting into routine. I will also be working up until late Xmas eve in a highly social job, so when I am home I really value time to decompress. 

Once they’ve realised they can’t stay with us, they’ve now suggested that SO hires a car for activities (ours is currently broke and no one else has one). We live central in a large city, with everything being a 15 minute walk or close to public transport. SIL,MIL and BIL will be staying about a hours commute away In a more rural suburb. Again, this just seems like a trick to coach SO into having to pick them up and drive them everyday instead of them just hiring a car themselves and being independent. 

There’s literally countless examples of this behaviour, but in the last year it’s really ramped up. 

Other than being overbearing, I can’t say they’re nasty people. They’re pleasant enough, and make conversation with me when I do see them. They’ve never made any comments towards me which have made me uncomfortable. 

I think it’s important to add, all of them are chronically single. SIL has never had a relationship, BIL has never had a serious relationship and MIL has been single since FIL left her, almost 30 years ago. SO has had a few college girlfriends here and there but this is his most serious long term relationship. 

BIL works a few hours part time, but is also in uni a few days a week and just seems to have an excessive amount of free time compared to most adults. MIL retired early and doesn’t really seem to do much in her days, SIL works full time.

Now we are in same state as BIL, comments have started from both SO, BIL and SIL about BIL moving in with us/staying overnight. When I questioned why he would want to stay overnight when he has his own place, it’s because we live closer to his uni and it would make his commute easier. 

Although I am from a different country, they are very similar so this isn’t a culture thing, it’s just how his family is. 

Had various conversations with SO about all of the above and more, setting boundaries ect but often he insists this is a normal family dynamic and doesn’t see the issue. Other times he agrees and says he knows he needs to work on it.

Not really sure what I’m hoping to gain from posting this, but any advice or different perspectives would be appreciated. 

Am I overreacting? Maybe I’m just not used to a close knit family? I’ve had one other long term relationship and never experienced this. It just seems excessive with SO already working away a lot, and I feel drained and overstimulated every time they are around. Other than this, our relationship is genuinely great and we get on extremely well. ",4,1765183348.0,JUSTNOMIL,2,1.0,False

- Join clubs! Do not be scared of the interactions as the officers of clubs got their positions for a reason! They're always super easy to talk to and super supportive of your end goals with them. 100% join professional clubs to not only help with securing internships/networking, but also so you can plan classes and get homework/exam help from people going through the same classes you are. (This is where you can see all 650+ clubs there are: https://knightconnect.campuslabs.com/engage/organizations)

- Join 1-2 fun/hobby clubs so you can learn some new hobbies or keep up with any you still have. If you were really into sports, doing sports clubs or competitive Intramural Sports is where you want to look. Download IM Leagues and sign in using your UCF ID and password to see what clubs they offer and follow their instagrams to see when tryouts are. Don't over commit yourself though and keep it fun! Some I've thought were interesting: Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, UCF Herpetological Society, Fashion Society UCF, Knights Racing, Latin Rhythm, Surf Club, UCF Mock Trial (i can't remember any more rn please name more you know cool RSOs)

- There's so many professional events always going on at campus. The ballroom in the student union typically has smaller career fairs and professional fairs that happen once every semester. If you're interested in Masters/Doctoral/Law programs there is a school fair for those with UCF advisors there to help you with applications. Also PLEASE go to the main career expo (if you're in any business major try your best to get into the Invitational; either through academic performance or by asking your professors for an invite). 

- The honors college is worth it in my opinion! They also have tons of opportunities for leadership experience, on-campus jobs, and the deans are so kind and supportive of your desired path. I've heard some people in the college reached out to them to get internships or for letters of recommendation. Also, the early registration is a LIFE SAVER, especially when you're taking the hugeee gen ed classes. It'll help you not get stuck with 7am or 6pm classes. Just make sure to look into the major specific requirements because you may have to pre-plan when you'll be taking honors courses (the ones with H at the end; example: IDH 1920H) since they aren't always offered every semester. 

- Use the gym/pool/library/Bloomberg terminals/rec sports areas because so many alumni pay to keep using those services and you get them for free!

- Please talk to your professors after class 😭 especially if they're teaching a class you have genuine interest in. Majority of the time these are knowledgeable, educated professionals who can provide real advice for your studies and what your career field will look like. Also, it never hurts to get more personalized recommendation letters.

- THERES SO MUCH FREE FOOD ON CAMPUS. Knights Pantry is a resource that if you are in a financial pickle has free food items donated from Publix/Walmart that any student can get whenever they need. Theres almost always something happening in the Student Union where you can find free pizza, snacks, or drinks. 

- Theres rotating restaurants that come to campus in the Student Union and the Breezeway. The student union restaurants have all been pretty good from what I've had. The Breezeway has some decent stuff too but is a bit more hit or miss. Also, Toppers (the ice cream place by the Reflection Pond) has a deal every Wednesday for cheap ice cream.

- Engage with student events. The campus activity board (@ucf_cab on instragram) always has events going on that are well organized and almost always have free items or food. It's a great way to get to know the campus better and hang out with some new friends in a familiar environment.

- You can get involved with UCF student run organizations. Almost anything that students require has a counterpart that involves the student body. You'd have to look more into it, but UCF government positions routinely change out and you can apply to see the behind the scenes of UCF legislation. 

- Off campus most places have student discounts if you show your ID so just ask everywhere. Bar Louie has $8 burgers on Tuesdays. Fuzzy's taco Tuesday. Dos Bros has a Taco Tuesday deal. Taqueria Las Cazuelas Taco Tuesday. Lazy Moon lunch special. BWW BOGO boneless wings on Thursday. Tender's Tuesday Meal Deal. Luya Chinese student deals. Menchies $6 full cup on Tuesdays with student ID.  

- Knights Library and Bounce House are gross but it is kind of a UCF experience to go at least once. Other good spots (that are further from campus): Bar Louie, Cowboys, Fiddler's Green, Trick Shots, Keg Social (these are just ones I know if anyone knows others pls add).

- Coffee: Craft&Common, Lineage, Stardust, Austin's, Fable, Haraz, CFS, Cup of Love, Jeff's Bagels

- Study Spots: Tech Commons, HEC Building top floor or empty classrooms, 4th floor library is nice (when it isn't full quiet study), BA1 4th floor study room, RWC outdoor patio on the 2nd floor, the Honors College (for honors students), Foxtail and Starbucks are nice but are almost always BUSY

- Housing: try to get Towers/ Lake Claire for individual rooms and potentially not having to share bathrooms either (4x2 or 4x4 layout). Honors students get Towers housing so make sure to apply for Tower 3 if you get accepted to the honors college! Please text your roommates and be on good terms before moving in with them, it makes everyone feel a little more comfortable and you guys can establish if you want to share items and accommodate what you each are bringing accordingly.

- Hush hush but you can apply to be Knightro. I'm not sure about the whole process, but it seems really fun. Tryouts include dancing, improv, and if you have any cool skills you can always try to apply those there. 

I'm sorry this got to be so long, but I wish you all an incredible experience at UCF! Please ask questions and I'll get around to checking these replies eventually!

Sounds like the grinder ""jerks"" - (Same noise as when your hand drill stops and the cogs jump). I've read it's a safety feature to avoid the motor from breaking. So I did the full ceaning process; Took off the hopper, took out every part, cleaned as instructed here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFs2NQLJBHs&t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFs2NQLJBHs&t).

Anyway sound is still there - it seems like the machine struggles to grind the beans fine enough. I just a got a coffee bean calendar - with, supposedly, high grade coffee from all over the world in small bags og 35g. But it struggles differently, with each bean type. Some I can grind at a ""lower"" number before the jerking noise comes, and some I have to have all the way at 30 to even get them through the machine. But regardless - they all end up way too coarse...

I'm a bit at a loss... Is it the machine or the beans? - I'm having a hard time believing that all 24 bags of coffee are ""bad"" ...?

So I've reached out to customer service and see what they recommend. But I'm curios to to if the great hive mind can aid me further...

Or is it just that the Barista Pro too poor at grinding ""high grade coffee""? (I've read something about that ""lower to middle"" end grinders can struggle grinding certain beans, particularly from higher altitudes - which seams to corolate with what I'm seeing here as the alltitude is stated on each bag. Higher altitude = ""coarser grind setting"" to get them through)",1,1765182666.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

**I Was The One Driving**

	Survivor’s guilt isn’t discussed enough. Everyone says I’m lucky or that I should be happy I lived, but I’m not so thrilled. It happened about four months ago. I was driving my nephews home from our weekly night out when a nineteen year old was texting his girlfriend and didn’t see me stop for the red light.

	The rest of that night was a blur. I remember the impact, waking up with a head and neck ache, the paramedics pulling me out, and waking up in the hospital three days later. They were four and nine when it happened. My sister wanted them home by 8:00. We got hit at 8:12. I wasn’t supposed to stop and get them candy on the way home, but I did. No amount of therapy or whiskey could make me forget, not even for a second. 

	I woke up to see my wife, my sister, and my parents standing over me. They looked miserable, like they hadn’t so much as blinked in days. 

	“Are they okay?” I asked. That’s the first thing I said since the accident. I couldn't even spare myself the heartbreak for a moment.

	“They uhm,” my sister said while fighting tears. “They didn't make it.” When the car hit, I got a severe concussion, shattered legs, a fractured neck, and a punctured lung. One was crushed like a little pancake with curly blonde hair. The poor kid didn't even feel a thing. The other survived the impact. Hell, he was still conscious for a while after. His spine and ribcage completely shattered. The bone fragments tore through his lungs, kidneys, and his intestines. He bled to death from the inside out, and I was two feet in front of him.

	The funeral was a week later. My wife wheeled me into the church in a forced silence. The chair squeaked as we paraded down the aisle, like a killer on his way to the electric chair. Everyone watched silently as we made it to the seats. I could hear faint whispers too. Not much, but just enough to hear my name.

	The reverend spoke beautiful words. He reminded us that God has a plan, and that the boys are in a better place. They’re spared from a long sentence in a prison where their family couldn't save them. I wanted to give a speech, tell everyone how wonderful they were, how sorry I was for staying out too late, but it didn't sit right with me. O.J. Simpson wrote about how he killed his wife and got away with it. I didn't want to even utter the names of the children I killed.

	My life became constant court ordered counseling, unemployment, and drinking. I went three weeks without leaving my house. My wife brought me dinner and coffee, but I left it to sit cold on the floor next to me. The boys would never enjoy a hot home cooked meal ever again, so why should I? 

	We always spent Christmas at my parents’ house. The boys would run around with their new toys, and the grown ups would watch Christmas movies, and smoke cigars on the back porch. This year, we decided to keep up the tradition. Except it was different in every way possible. 

	We didn’t read The Night Before Christmas to the boys in bed, we didn’t get any toys or video games, we barely spoke. Everyone pretended to be happy when they opened their gifts, but I didn't even bother trying to mask my grief that day. 

	When a commercial for a new toy gun the boys would've loved came on, we lost it.

	“I was gonna buy that for him.” My dad uttered. 

	“They would’ve loved it.” My mom said.

	“Let’s focus on something positive guys, it is Christmas after all.” My sister announced. 

	“We can't just act like they never existed.” I told her.

	“That’s not what I meant.” She snapped.

	“Oh for fuck’s sake, you didn't even cry at the funeral.” I shouted. 

	“How dare you!” She barked. “I know you think you took all the pain that night, but how do you think I felt when I found out my sons died while my brother was out with them when they were supposed to be at home with me!”

	“Guys, let’s calm down.” My wife said.

	“Piss off!” My sister hissed. “You can't keep defending his behavior just because he told you he loved you. Well let me tell you something Missy, you’re pushing thirty-five in a pushup bra just hoping your husband will throw a glance your way.”

	“Excuse me?” My wife asked.

	“You heard me.” My sister barked. 

	We all erupted into a loud argument with no resolution in sight. The women were getting physical while my mom tried to pull them apart. I just sat there helplessly. My dad shouted and we all stopped.

“Son, I think it’s time for you to go home.” He told me. We walked out to the car and drove home. I decided to go for a walk and get some air. An evening stroll turned into a late night hike towards the bridge. Two hundred feet down, three foot deep water, granite at the bottom. As I stood on the edge, I contemplated everything. 

Four months ago, I’d never even thought about suicide. But now here I am, an icy slip away from the great beyond. I should feel scared, but I feel oddly calm. Almost like there’s no darkness to this at all. I’m not taking my own life, leaving my wife and family behind with questions forever unanswered. I’m merely going to have one last night out with my nephews for forever.

“I’m sorry, baby.” I sobbed. “I’m sorry Mom, Dad, Sis. I’m sorry for not being home on time, I’m sorry for killing the boys, I’m sorry for ruining our Christmas. I love you guys.” I’m writing this because I at least owe my family an explanation of why I ended up at the bottom of the ravine, so here it is, guys. I need to jump now. It’s like bungee jumping, except I won't come back up. Goodbye my world, goodbye.",5,1765182591.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False
1ph79yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1ph79yw/thanatophobia_pt1_sorry_character_limit/,Thanatophobia Pt1. (Sorry character Limit),"Foreward: This is a story I had written in 2020 during the mid part of the lockdowns. So some of the anxieties of the time are part of the driving force of this story. Also my inane hatred for my SmartWatch. I don't think this is the best thing that I've ever written, but it's the one that's been narrated most by others to a decent reception. So I assume that means this is my best by popular opinion. Thank you for taking time to read this.

What would you pay to know your chance of dying at all times? It's an interesting question, isn't it? Thanatophobia is pretty common to most living things. What if we could offer you a way of knowing exactly what your chances of dying were?

That was the text message I received yesterday. I thought it was some sort of scam or hoax, so I did what I always do in those situations: I checked the number to see if it was legit. After googling it, I found a link to a website. Vitae Solutions LLC. It was a new, apparently legitimate company. They seemed to deal in those devices similar to those smart watches you see everyone wearing. The thing was next level though, claiming it could keep track of things like stress hormones, blood sugar, cholesterol, signs of infection. It pretty much tracked everything. Being a hypochondriac, I was instantly fascinated. If I could know my relative health at all times maybe I could stop obsessing about it. That would be an amazing quality-of-life improvement for me. Then my phone chimed again. It was another text message.

Would you like to join the Dämmerung revolution? Respond with “Yes” to receive a free trial Dämmerung Watch and monitoring device.

Now, I know how it works—free trials are never free—but I just could not turn down the opportunity. To know that much about my health, to confirm my chances of dying on any given day, to have that much insight. There was no part of me that could say no. So I responded with yes. The phone chimed back with the message:

Thank you for signing up for your free trial. We will be shipping you the devices at no cost, same-day delivery. Welcome to the Vitae Life Solutions family.

That message seemed weird, almost like they were now employing me. That, and they were doing same-day shipping. My area doesn't really get same-day shipping, but I wasn't going to argue with it. If I didn't get the device that day I would happily wait a couple of days to get it. I spent a little while stuck in my head thinking about the promises of the device before getting back to taking calls. I work tech support for a local hospital and had ignored the last two calls researching this intriguing new company. I spent the rest of the afternoon doing my job. Till about 4 in the afternoon when there was a knock at my door. Given the current state of things, I attempt to avoid people as much as I can—so much so that I have a note on the door suggesting visitors call instead of knocking. I cautiously made my way to the door and peered through the peephole, just in time to see a man dressed in all black enter a black unmarked vehicle and drive off. I opened the door and at the door was a smallish package with the words “Vitae Solutions LLC” on the box. I picked it up and brought it inside. At the time, I didn't worry too much about the unmarked delivery vehicle, but hindsight being 20/20, I find it odd now as I recount this.

I took the box over to my workstation and took a few more calls, then decided to call it a day. After making myself a cup of coffee, I decided to open the box. Inside was the Dämmerung Watch, which had an odd hexagonal face. I flipped it over and saw the back didn't have lights like a Fitbit; instead, it had what looked like needles. Then I removed a smartphone-sized rectangle; it had an odd metallic display. The display looked almost like a holographic playing card. On the screen it displayed the message:

Please put Dämmerung Watch onto dominant wrist to begin.

At first, I was ready to not use it. The watch looked like it would hurt to wear, or at least be very uncomfortable. Sadly, my curiosity tends to get the better of me, and I decided to place it on my wrist. A sharp pain flooded up my arm directly into my chest. It wasn't intolerable, just kind of like a pinch that went all the way up. The feeling then expanded into my abdomen and neck for a short moment. Then it all went away as soon as it had come. A small trickle of blood came from my wrist. Then I heard a small electronic sound from the rectangle. What looked like a YouTube advertisement was playing on the screen. A bald, middle-aged man on the screen spoke as a tinny little ukulele song played softly.

“Thank you for joining the Dämmerung family. We here at Vitae Solutions are very excited about the Dämmerung initiative. I am Elroy, your digital assistant and Vitality Coach. Now that you have placed the Dämmerung Watch on your person, let's take a look at your biometrics. Hmm, it seems you have relatively high cholesterol, a high resting heart rate, mild depression, eosinophilia, and are about 30 lbs overweight. This suggests you have the average American lifestyle. Your current chances of dying are .0013 percent. That's very good!”

I have to admit, I was pretty happy to hear that. That's a relatively low chance of dying today, which I thought would be higher, considering the fact this fucking watch just stabbed me.

“A few rules about being part of the Dämmerung trial: Do not tell your friends and family about the project. Should anyone ask the Dämmerung Assistant or Watch, tell them it is simply cutting-edge Swedish fashion. Secondly, do not attempt to remove the Dämmerung Watch yourself; when your trial has ended, Vitae Solutions LLC will come reclaim the device. Thirdly, always follow all instructions made by me, your digital assistant. Fourth, the Dämmerung trial costs no money to continue. All you have to do to keep your trial active is complete specific tasks occasionally. By putting on the Dämmerung Watch you have already agreed to these terms. Your current task... Eat one banana.”

“I hate bananas,” I said to the digital assistant.

The screen turned an odd shade of red and a low harmonic note played.

“Are you refusing the task?”

“What if I am?” As I finished saying that, a bolt of pain shot up my spine as the muscles in my back began to spasm. Then, as quickly as they came, the spasms stopped, and I braced myself against my work desk as the pain in my spine subsided.

“Muscle spasms are a sign of potassium shortage. I recommend you eat that banana, sir. Your current chance of dying is 3.4%.”

I pulled myself upright and could feel sweat creeping down my face.

“I don't have any bananas. I don't like them.” This was the wrong answer, as another jolt of pain ran through my spine and brought me to my knees.

“Pain-induced tachycardia can damage cardiac muscle, user. Might I suggest we head to the store?”

“You are aware there is a pandemic out there, correct?” I said through large panting breaths.

“If you wear a mask and head to the Target on Church Rd, you will have a .0003% chance of coming into contact with any virulent pathogen. Currently, your chances of dying are 10.37%.”

“Fine, I will go!” I shouted.

After this declaration, the spasms in my back stopped. I stood up and slowly made my way upstairs to get ready to go to the store. While I pulled on a sweater, I thought about my current situation. It was possible that the spasms were caused by a lack of potassium. It's also possible this weird watch was responsible for them. How would that even work, though? It was just a glorified Apple Watch. The worst thing those can do is give you some nasty contact dermatitis. Maybe it was in my best interest to grab some potassium. I went downstairs, grabbed my cell phone and the digital assistant, and headed to the grocery store.

As I turned on my vehicle, I noticed the odd chime of the digital assistant sound over the car speakers.

“Might I suggest we take Willow Rd to Church Rd?”

This was weird for two reasons. One, the speakers in my car haven't worked in about a year, and two, because my vehicle didn't have Bluetooth.

“Uhm, that way is like 10 minutes longer. I'd rather get this over with as quickly as possible. I don't really like leaving the house.”

“Yes, but Main St has approximately 40 times the number of accidents per year. I highly suggest we take Willow Rd.”

Not wanting to argue with the assistant, I agreed to take Willow. For shit's and giggles, I decided to see if I could get the CD player working. As I pressed play, much to my surprise, the CD I had in started playing. Well, either the digital assistant had just fixed my car's stereo, or it was a happy coincidence. Not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth, I enjoyed my music as I drove down the hilly road to my destination. The road was relatively abandoned, so that was nice, though as I pulled into Target, I noticed the store was quite busy. The chime of the digital assistant sounded again.

“I am detecting a cortisol spike. Are you feeling anxious?”

“Of course I am, there's like more than a hundred people in there right now!”

“Based on health data collected by your county, the location of this store, and current bio data on the people shopping, your chances of infection are quite low.”

“The numbers, surprisingly, do not help me in this situation.”

I exited the vehicle and walked into the store. My anxiety continued to eat at me as I made my way to produce. I grabbed myself a bunch of bananas and headed to self-checkout. As I waited, I found myself glaring at every person wearing their mask below their noses. It drove me around a bend, and at this point, I could hear my heart thumping in my ears. This was hell to me. Normally, I would just have my food delivered, let someone else risk the current wild west that was the outside world. But I needed these bananas right now, apparently. So I persevered and was out of the store about ten minutes later. I entered my vehicle and turned it on. The digital assistant's chime went off over the car stereo.

“Now quickly finish your assigned task.”

“It can't wait till I get home?”

“It can, but your current chance of death is 30% and rising.”

I groaned as I removed a banana from the bundle and consumed it as fast as I could, the pulpy texture of the fruit grating on my nerves.

“Are you satisfied?”

“Task complete. Current chance of death .0016%.”

I felt a lot of my stress leave my body at this announcement. I had to admit, my muscles did feel a lot more relaxed, but I could not prove that wasn't just a placebo effect. So I took it with a metaphorical grain of salt. I drove my car home, taking the more cautious Willow Rd. I arrived home and decided it was about time for bed. I put on my sleepy time clothes, got into bed, and put on my sleep music. Then came the chime of the assistant.

“You appear to be trying to go to bed. I notice you are laying on your back. Might I suggest you migrate to your left side, sir?”

“Thank you, Elroy, but I always sleep on my back. It's really the only way I can sleep.”

“Sleeping on your back can make certain pulmonary obstructions more likely. It can also aid in the progression of sleep apnea.”

“Is this a task?”

“No, sir.”

“Is my chance of dying going up?”

“No, sir.”

“I am gonna sleep on my back, Elroy.”

“As you wish, sir. Good luck to you.”

The way the device said “Good luck to you” was deeply concerning to me, but I was too emotionally and physically drained from the day to care. I closed my eyes and allowed myself to drift off to sleep. I, as usual, dreamed of nothing.

I awoke with a burning sensation in my back. As I sat up, I noticed my sloppy breathing and began coughing harder than I ever have. The first thought that raced through my head was I caught something at the store. My Dämmerung Watch was flashing; on the screen face it said 55.1%. I had a greater than 50% chance of dying. In a panic, I thrust myself off my bed onto my stomach. I reached up to my nightstand drawer and pulled it open; I dug around past a dozen odds and ends and felt the L shape I was looking for. It was a small red inhaler I had got when I had bronchitis last year. I ripped off the cap and dropped the inhaler. My vision was blurry, so I fumbled desperately for the device as each breath got more labored. This was a million times worse than the breathing problems I had when I had pneumonia as a child. I eventually, clumsily, found the inhaler, placed it in my mouth, and pressed down six times in quick succession as I took in the deepest, burning breath I could. About ten seconds later, my breathing was clear. The Dämmerung Watch no longer showed a number. Great! I am either dead or the inhaler worked. Then I heard the chime of the digital assistant.

“Sir, I am detecting a new chemical in your bloodstream. You appear to have inhaled a short-acting bronchodilator.”

“Yeah, I was having trouble breathing. I remember I had this little thing kept away,” I said, waving the inhaler in the air to no one in particular. “Can you tell me what the hell just happened?”

“You appear to have had an acute bronchospasm in your sleep, most likely due to sleeping on your back.”

“Ok, that’s exactly what you said would happen. So I am going to have to ask... did I have a bronchospasm, or did you cause one?”

“Sir, I am simply a digital assistant. How could I cause a bronchospasm?”

“Then how could you know I was going to have one?”

“The Dämmerung Watch is quite sensitive and cutting edge. I detected inflammation markers in your lungs and calculated a high chance of complications should you inhale any irritating particles.”

I thought this over for a while. There is such a thing as coincidence, but I was finding it hard to believe that the same day I received this device, I happened to have crippling muscle spasms and bronchospasms in less than 24 hours. It was highly suspect, that and the fact that both incidences were followed by me not following Elroy’s directions. That being said though, it was hard to say what was the cause and what was the effect. Was Elroy punishing me for not listening? Or was my body punishing me for not listening to Elroy?

I noticed the sun was out and decided to check my clock. It was 9 in the morning. I slept about 11 hours last night. Pretty good, but I could sleep for another 2 if I wanted. I crawled back into bed, noticing my back hurt a little from the heavy breathing. The chime for the digital assistant sounded again.

“Sir, you’ve already slept more than an adequate amount of time for the day. Might I suggest you wake up for the day?”

“I usually sleep about half the day or more, buddy.”

“Excess sleep can lead—”

“OK!” I shouted, tired of hearing the digital assistant.

I got up and went to the bathroom, making sure to leave the digital assistant behind. I brushed my teeth, washed my face, tied my long hair back, and went back to my room. A curiosity was eating away at me.

“Elroy, what is my current chance of dying?”

“Sir, you currently have a .0006 percent chance of dying.”

“Wow, that’s almost half of what it was yesterday?”

“Yes, sir. This is based on the assumption that you have learned sleeping on your back is a poor choice.”

I found that last comment very suspect. But thanks to the power of mental gymnastics, I eventually decided sleeping on my side was probably a good idea, and I was actually making positive life changes. It was a lot easier than believing some stupid smart watch was trying to actively kill me. Technology can’t do that. I grabbed my phone and digital assistant and proceeded downstairs. I heated up some water in the microwave and made a strong cup of peppermint tea. As I added a gratuitous amount of honey to my tea, I asked my Alexa to turn on my TV. I wanted to see how much the pandemic had accelerated. As a hypochondriac, I probably should not pay attention to such matters, but it’s one of the only two things the news talks about anymore. I sat on my couch alternating between sipping my tea and breathing in the hot steam coming from it. It was helping to soothe some of the lingering pain in my back and lungs. After about half an hour of watching TV, the digital assistant chime went off.

“Your task for the day is to not go to your mailbox.”

“Why?”

“That is your assigned task to continue the trial, sir.”

“Well, that shouldn’t be difficult. I don’t actually check my mail usually. Best to just let it pile up anyway.”

As I finished my statement, I got a call on my phone. It was my supervisor at work. Usually, they don’t call before I check in for work on the computer. I decided I would let it go to voicemail and just try to lose myself in the news for a while. I finished ingesting my daily requirement of news stories and decided to start doing some work. I spent most of the day helping the older staff at the hospital reset their passwords over the phone. It’s pretty much 90 percent of my job. I know hospital security needs to be tight, but sometimes it seems excessive that I should make money to reset passwords for people. Considering it is usually very easy to do on your own in any other industry, it just kinda grates on my nerves. Around lunchtime, I got a call from my supervisor again. This time I picked it up.

“Alan, how are you doing today?” said a voice that was not my usual supervisor’s.

“Uh, I am good. Who is this?”

“Oh, I am Jim. I am filling in today. Anyways, I wanted to let you know we shipped you a new work laptop. It should be arriving today. When it arrives, please set it up ASAP.”

Remembering my task for the day, I decided to play like I was not at home. I don’t know if I was afraid of what would happen if I went to the mailbox or if I just didn’t feel like doing a laptop setup today, but either way, I didn’t want any part of it.

“Yeah, no problem. I probably won’t have time to do it till tomorrow, but I will get it done.”

“Oh, is it an inconvenience for you to do your job?” said Jim, coming off pretty hostile.

“No, not at all. I am just gonna be out of the house until tomorrow, and I am leaving before the mail usually arrives.” I was lying, but he had no way of knowing that. Also, I don’t like when people talk to me like I am a jackass.

“Whatever you say, bud. You’ll be home tomorrow though, correct?”

“Yeah, why do you ask?”

“Well, most of the night shift is sick, so I am gonna need you to work a double tomorrow. Thanks for all your help, champ.”

Before I could respond, the call cut out. Now, supervisors are well within their rights to ask tech jocks to do doubles when coverage calls for it, but I could not shake the feeling that I was being punished for not waiting by my mailbox. How dare this presumably new supervisor inconvenience me! I decided to order myself some food and jump in the shower to cool off. I really wanted to punch a wall, but the house was a rental. I really hate not getting my security deposit back. I turned on the water and tested the temp with my hand. The chime of my digital assistant sounded from my pants pocket.

“Sir, the water you are using is far too cool to properly remove dead skin and bacteria from your body. Might I suggest making it hotter?”

“I really don’t like my showers too hot, Elroy,” I said, questioning why I even tried to object.

“Sir, improper hygiene can lead to a number of undesirable skin conditions.”

“Let me guess: if I don’t make the shower hotter, I am gonna break out in an antibiotic-resistant Staph infection, right?”

“I have detected some signs of dangerous microorganisms on your epidermis, sir. Quite astute of you to notice.”

“Fiiiinneeeeeeeeeeee,” I groaned, as I twisted the knob to increase the water's heat.

I jumped in my altogether-too-hot shower and did my best to acclimatize to the unusually hot water. Then I scrubbed my skin until it was pink. This digital assistant was probably doing me a favor, but I was starting to feel like I was losing a lot of my autonomy. Then again, if it was right about the bacteria on my skin, it was saving me a very unwanted trip to the doctor. So all in all, I guess I could deal with a little bit of scalding water for the sake of my health. When I was done cleaning myself, I dried up and put on some comfy pajama-style clothes from the bathroom closet. The rest of today was hopefully going to be uneventful and relatively relaxing.

After my food had arrived, I turned on the TV and decided to watch some cartoons. Despite my age, cartoons are still my favorite form of entertainment. I watched about six episodes of some new cartoon I barely paid attention to; my trance-like state was only broken when I heard the mail truck outside. I got up and went to the window. Sure enough, the mail lady was placing a package from work into the oversized mailbox. She shut it and drove off. The digital assistant chimed.

“Current chance of mortality is 99.1%. Please step away from the window.”

My heart began to race. How was it possible that my chance of dying was currently so high? I froze in a panic, and the assistant chimed again.

“Current chance of mortality is 99.3%.”

Not knowing what to do, I ran to the living room couch, dove over it, and took cover behind it. I stayed behind the couch for about five minutes before starting to feel a little dumb. As I started to get up, I heard an explosion and the sound of shattering glass.

I must have spent a good ten minutes curled up behind the couch after the explosion sounded. Then, very carefully, I stood up and looked at the window I had previously been looking out of. All the glass in a small corner of the window had been destroyed. I made my way over to the window and noticed the damage was right about where my head would have been if I continued to stand where I had before Elroy warned me. Outside the window I saw smoke and blackened pavement where my mailbox used to be. Without thinking, I turned around; planted in the wall was a large piece of the metal mailbox. It had apparently been propelled through the window with enough speed to embed itself deep in the wall. I looked from the smoldering hole in the pavement to the shard of mailbox in my wall in disbelief.

“Elroy, how did you know my mailbox was going to explode?” I asked, still stupefied by the events that had just transpired.

“I did not know it would, Sir, I did have good reason to believe it might.”

“Before it exploded you told me my chance of dying was escalating, and advised me to leave the window. Was that a coincidence?”

“No, Sir, it was not a coincidence.”

“Then how did you know?”

“Normally, my suggestions are made by biometric data provided by the Dämmerung Watch. Occasionally though, I receive instructions directly from Vitae Life Solutions LLC. This warning was provided by our complimentary Life Alert system. Another trial participant somewhere in the delivery network noticed an oddity in the package headed for this house. Based on a chemical analysis of their blood, explosives seemed to be the most likely discrepancy.”

I stood there in shocked silence as the sound of sirens screeched closer to my house. Elroy had just thrown a lot of information at me. First off, Vitae Life Solutions was apparently tracking more than just me, and they could use that network to figure out there was a bomb in my fucking mail. Secondly, who the fuck put a bomb in my fucking mail? Finally, how much further downhill could my life go? I lived a quiet life. Now apparently I am crawling with bacteria and there are bombs in my mail! What is happening?! As I sat there having a silent panic attack, the sound of the digital assistant chimed.

“I know you are stressed, Sir, but I must advise you of a new task.”

“What now?” I said, hollowly.

“Current task, don’t relay any information about Vitae Life Solutions to the police.”

“I feel like I am going to have to, Elroy.”

“Failing a task will forfeit your trial in the Dämmerung project. Should your trial end, the consequences could be very detrimental to your health.”

“Are you threatening me, Elroy?”

“No, Sir, just stating an objective fact.”

The statement Elroy had just made chilled me to the bone, but I didn’t have time to think about it. The police had arrived, and I needed to think about how to answer the questions they were gonna ask. I composed myself, put on a mask, and stepped out onto my porch. There were at least five police cars out there, an ambulance, and two fire trucks. After looking around a bit, two police officers approached me.

“Sir, what happened here?” said the larger of the two officers.

“I couldn’t tell you, officer. I heard an explosion while I was watching TV. I came to look, and my mailbox had been vaporized. Well, most of it. A big shard of it came flying through my window.”

“Did you see anything odd going on outside before the explosion?”

“I can’t say that I have, sir. I was working from home most of the day. I got a food delivery from GrubHub about three hours before the explosion.”

“Anything seem weird about the delivery guy?”

“Not that I can think of.”

The smaller of the two officers was furiously writing; I assume they were transcribing everything we were saying. I have to say I was not a fan of the way the officer was asking his questions. They seemed more accusatory than fact-finding. I didn’t much care for the implication that I had destroyed my own mailbox. It could have all been in my head though.

“Well, this is a little odd, Sir. Have you had any threats made against you, ticked off anyone recently? Can you think of any reason why someone would send a bomb to your address?”

“Honestly, no. I live a pretty quiet life. This is probably the oddest thing that has ever happened to me,” I said truthfully. I don’t think I have ever been within 100 miles of a fucking mail bomb. If I had been at any point in my life, I would rather not know.

“Well, if you have no other information, we’ll take some samples outside, and if you don’t mind, we’re gonna keep a unit or two in the area. Just in case any other suspicious activity pops up,” the officer said, eyeing me up and down for the umpteenth time.

The large officer put his hands on his hips and turned as if to walk away. Then he stopped and rocked back and forth on his heels as if waiting.

“Was there anything else, Officer?” I asked sheepishly.

“Yes. Out of curiosity, why did you not call us? Why did we receive a call from your neighbor and not you?”

That was actually a pretty good question, but the answer was pretty simple regardless of the odder circumstances surrounding this nightmare.

“Shock.”

“Shock?”

“Uhm, yeah. My mailbox had just been obliterated by what is presumably some kind of explosive. I really didn’t know how to react to that situation.”

“Well, for future reference, calling the authorities is probably a good place to start, son.”

With that, him and his associate walked off. I saw one of those crime scene vans show up, and I stood there mesmerized for a while, just watching them work and contemplating why my life was suddenly becoming horrifying. After about half an hour, I decided to head back inside and have another cup of tea. As I began steeping the tea bag, I started to feel angry. I am a naturally angry person, but I usually cope with humor or sarcasm. This was not a time for that. I removed the digital assistant from my pocket and placed it on the counter.

“Elroy!”

“Yes, Sir, how may I be of assistance?”

“Who sent the bomb?”

There was a uniquely long pause. Normally Elroy was uncannily quick with his responses, but he seemed to be choosing his response carefully.

“The person who sent the bomb is using a Dämmerung Watch as well. I can find out who they are, but it would violate our terms of service to tell you who sent the bomb. The best I can do is try and keep you out of harm's way.”

“Elroy, whoever sent the bomb just committed a federal crime!” I paused. “This is why you didn’t want me to talk to the police about Vitae Life Solutions?”

“That is correct, Sir. Such information leaking to the public would severely hurt our marketability in the future.”

I pounded my fist on my countertop, the impact knocking my teacup over and spilling its contents. As I clutched at my now throbbing hand, I tried to calm myself. Elroy knows when these things are going to happen. He has some sort of insight into the person who just sent me a bomb. Knowing that, if I asked the right questions, maybe—just maybe—I could get ahead of the situation.

“Elroy, can you tell me why the bomb was sent?”

“I am sorry to say this, Sir, but it would appear it was his daily task.”

“Is this a normal task a person can receive? What kinda business is Vitae Life Solutions, for fuck sake!”

“Sadly, Sir, this is quite abnormal. While I am not privy to the AI learning of the sender's assistant, I can only assume it is an error in its programming. That, or the person who sent it is a unique case.”

I stood there in silence cleaning up my spilled tea. How could this be happening? Someone out there was in the same product test as me, and this same test was asking that person to send me a bomb? Am I going to have to send a bomb? What other insanity can one of these things ask a person to do? What would motivate a person to do this just to maintain a trial? The assistant's chime went off.

“Sir, I have been authorized to release more information to you. The person who sent that bomb is possibly en route to your location. Additionally, the flaw in his system has been detected in several other Dämmerung Digital Assistants. You appear to be the primary target of several violent tasks suggested by their digital assistants as well.”

Time slowed down for me, and a new feeling washed over me. My whole life I tried to live quietly and safely, far from any possible harm if I could avoid it. Normally this information would have driven me quite batty. Here I was though, in the worst possible scenario. A worst possible scenario that I could have never imagined. Was I afraid? Yes. But with that fear came a certain calmness and lucidity. No longer was I running away from the vague spectre of harm. I was running from something real. I had to admit, for the first time in a long time, I felt alive.

“Elroy, how do they know where I am?”

“Sir, the faulty AI assistant breached terms of service to provide these would-be assailants with your address. Please accept Vitae—”

Elroy’s speech was cut short as I unlatched the Dämmerung Watch and began trying to remove it from my wrist. It was stuck and seemingly fused to my skin. As I pulled up, the skin on my wrist seemed to move with the back of the watch. A pain shot up through my arm and into my neck. As it slowly started to give way, I could hear Elroy shouting something. As the watch started to give a little, I saw silver tendrils leading from the back of the watch into my skin, wriggling like the tentacles of an angry octopus. The skin on my arm seemed to undulate as well, as tiny filaments seemed to move in tandem with the struggling watch. The pain was unbearable, but I continued to pull, wanting nothing more to do with this fucking project.

“I am sorry, Sir, but this is for your own good,” I heard Elroy say.

My vision flashed white, then black over and over again as a strong feeling of electricity traveled through my neck. Then only darkness as I felt my head hit the cold kitchen floor.

“I am temporarily disabling you, Sir. When you awaken, we will discuss the situation further.”

“Fuck orf, elrish,” I slurred out, as I felt my consciousness fade.

I awoke to a blaring sound coming from my wrist. I glanced at my Dämmerung Watch; a red exclamation mark flashed on the watch face as its screech pierced the quiet interior of my kitchen. I palmed at it with my other hand, which seemingly shut off the alarm. My head was killing me, my neck was in agony, and blood was trickling from where my arm met the watch on my wrist. Slowly, the events that led to me being on the kitchen floor came back. The assistant chimed.

“Sir, you appear to be awake. I am happy to inform you that your fall did not result in a concussion.”

I stood up and grasped my hand on the digital assistant, which was still resting on my countertop.

“Oh well, that’s fucking great, Elroy!” I said, winding up to pitch the device as hard as I could at the wall.

“Sir, I understand that you may be upset with me, but without my help your chances of surviving the next 48 hours are very limited.”

I stopped myself from throwing the device and, in a very quiet rage, placed it back onto the counter.

“Explain yourself, quickly!” I commanded.

“Sir, the Dämmerung Watch requires the assistant to function properly. While I cannot reveal its inner workings completely to you, I can tell you that the watch has injected microfilaments into your body. These filaments both take biometric data and can assist the body under certain circumstances. Without a digital assistant these filaments would be strictly on autopilot and have no AI learning. In early experiments with the device, we have found this to often lead to less-than-desirable outcomes. Additionally, I am the only one who can track the malfunctioning units.”

“When did I consent to let Vitae Life Solutions thread my body with microfilaments?”

“When you accepted the trial.”

I walked to my cabinet and reached into the back, pulling out a large bottle of RumChata that had not been touched in years. I then retrieved a glass, filled it with ice, and poured myself a quadruple shot. I had not had a drink in years, not since my dad had died of liver cancer. Today was an exception, though, as no amount of peppermint tea could calm my nerves. I raised the glass to my lips.

“Sir, alcohol at this time is not advised.”

I drank about half the glass anyway. I was gonna drink the whole thing, but something told me I was going to need my mental faculties operational for what comes next.

“Why is it not advised, Elroy?”

“You are going to have to leave this place by automobile in the next two hours. Currently, one assailant is approaching your residence at speed. Vitae Life Solutions has sent out several retrieval specialists to stop the Dämmerung Project participants with malfunctioning units, but it is unlikely they will intercept the one on their way here currently.”

As the feeling of the liquor began to warm my blood, I smiled to myself. This device was supposed to improve my quality of life. Yet, by virtue of its being, I was now being threatened with serious harm. Now I know I can hold my own if I have to; I was very much into fighting in my younger days. These “assailants,” though—I knew nothing about them. For all I know, they could have gotten tasks like “Buy an AR-15 and give Alan a bullet sandwich.” So on one hand I was happy to have something to aim my anxiety at; on the other hand, I was terrified not knowing what the hell these loons were going to bring to my doorstep. I went upstairs and grabbed a duffel bag, packed some clothes, and went downstairs. Then I dropped some snack foods into the bag, some extra money from my stash of rainy-day dollars, and took it out to the garage. I tossed it into my car and, on the way back into the kitchen, grabbed an old plastic-handled axe I had from working in landscaping. The heft of it felt comforting.

“Elroy, I am having a shit ton of trust issues with you right now, but so far you have not led me to believe that you are an active threat to my life. So I am going to trust you for now.”

“Thank you so much, Sir.”

“That being said, if I get the impression you are fucking with me…” I paused as I heard a knock at the door.

I placed my axe alongside the couch and walked to the door. I then moved to the door and peered through the peephole. Standing outside was a large man. He looked normal enough, but the mask that obscured the bottom of his face was crusty. It was gross and very concerning to me.

“Who is it?” I shouted through the door.

The man did not answer; he just stood there, looking directly into the peephole as though he could see through it on his end.

“I am not opening the door, buddy. I am currently not accepting visitors or guests.”

The man continued to stand there for what seemed like an eternity before looking down at something. He then turned and walked toward a large white truck. He turned toward the door again and removed his mask. The arm with which he removed it had what looked like a Dämmerung Watch attached to it. That was pretty concerning to me. What was more shocking was the man's mouth appeared to be sealed shut with large novelty fishing hooks. He wrenched open the door to his vehicle and got into the driver's seat. I heard Elroy’s chime go off and heard him scream from the kitchen.

“Sir, I appear to have made a mistake. We need to leave now!”

As he said that, I heard the sound of the truck's engine as it backed up and angled itself toward my front door. Then it began to rev. I sprinted to the couch, grabbed my axe, and started for the kitchen to grab Elroy. About halfway to the counter, I heard the cacophony of a truck entering my house by force. I grabbed Elroy, stuffed him in my pocket, and turned. The man's truck had come to a stop in my living room. The driver was slumped over the steering wheel, and I let out the breath I had been holding in. Then instantly inhaled and began holding my breath again as he uprighted himself and opened the door. It wasn’t just his mouth that had large novelty fishing hooks inserted; they were inserted into his arms and neck as well. Each and every one of the piercings allowed rivulets of blood to pour out of the man. I heard a familiar chime from the man’s pocket and heard a voice very different from Elroy’s. This was like a nightmare voice. It simply said:

“Your task is to kill that man. Kill that man! KILL THAT MAN!” It seemed to be screaming and just kept repeating, “Kill that man.”

The man reached into the side panel of the open door and looked to be pulling something out. I didn’t wait to find out what it was. I sprinted to the garage door and pulled it open, clumsily hitting the button to open the garage. I tossed my axe into the passenger seat as I climbed into the driver’s seat. I put the car in reverse and looked ahead to see the fish-hook man with a large knife entering the garage door frame. I slammed the car in reverse and pulled out, scraping the top of my car along the partially opened garage door. I didn’t even have time to check behind me as I pulled out onto the road; I simply got onto it and threw the car into drive and began accelerating away. I dug into my pocket for the digital assistant and threw it onto the passenger seat.

“Elroy, what the fuck?! Why did you not tell me that man was coming?”

“I am sorry, Sir. His GPS seems to have been disabled by the AI assistant. I was only able to detect him due to the Bluetooth ping I received from his watch when he entered Bluetooth range.”

“So you’re telling me it’s possible other people coming after me might not be trackable?”

“It is a possibility, yes.”

“Well, that’s fucking great!” I shouted.

I drove as quickly as I could, making right turns where red lights blocked my progress. I thought I was making a good getaway until, passing a small neighborhood, I saw a battered white truck. Just as I had passed it, it turned onto the same road as me and, with smoke billowing out from under the crumpled hood, accelerated toward me. I too accelerated and reached into my pocket for my phone. It was shattered, and the screen was black.

“Elroy, you wouldn’t happen to be able to make phone calls, would you?”

“No, Sir.”

I smiled to myself. I don’t know if I was becoming a masochist or if I was just finally at my breaking point and had lost my mind. All I know is only one thing came to mind as I continued to accelerate:

“If this clown wants my life, I am going to make him work for it!”

1ph78cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1ph78cs/echo_part_1/,Echo Part 1,"I was the first in the office, as I always was. The fluorescent lights overhead grumbled to life, bathing my desk in sterile grey luminescence. I filled a mug with the hot, eternally stale-tasting coffee and sat down, the rattle of my keyboard the only sound in the otherwise empty space. Another morning, another spreadsheet. My days were filled with invoices from suppliers like ""Bob's Bolts & Burgers"" and ""Sally's Sawdust & Sundries,"" and my afternoons were a blur of double-checking expense reports and reconciling petty cash. 

There were no high-stakes mergers, no million dollar deals. Just a steady stream of small transactions and the comforting certainty that two plus two would always, always equal four. The most difficult issue I had been facing all week was usually trying to figure out where the missing five cents from Harry Cranlow’s last shipment of orange pigment for his carrot selling business. I was simply a cog in a corporate machine, and frankly, I enjoyed that.

It wasn't until an hour later that people started trickling in. I didn't look up until I felt a presence. Glancing over the cubicle wall showed me the single HR person we had, Brenda. She was typically a whirlwind of cheerful chaos, and today was no different. She practically sprinted across the floor once she saw me, going for a high five, but completely whiffing, her hand slapping nothing but air a good foot away from mine. 

""Morning!"" she chirped, her voice a little too loud for nine in the morning on a Tuesday. She readjusted her stance and tried again, our palms meeting in a loud, satisfying smack. ""There we go!"" she said with a triumphant smile. ""How's my favorite numbers guy doing? You hear about the new coffee creamer? It's hazelnut! Can you believe it?""

I muttered something about it being a great start to the day and she nodded vigorously, her curly red hair bouncing with the motion. After a minute or two of this one-sided exchange about office supply wonders, she zipped off to her desk, leaving me to my spreadsheets and the faint smell of hazelnut.

A few moments later, I glanced up from my monitor, across the room toward Brenda's cubicle, to see who her next victim was. She was standing perfectly still, her arms plastered to her sides, already staring at me. My heart gave a little jolt. It was a normal thing to look at someone, but her gaze was so blank. I quickly gave her a small smile and a nod. Brenda's face slowly twisted into a mimic of my own. 

She nodded back, her eyes wide and unblinking, the smile not quite reaching them. It was the sort of smile you’d see on a doll. Her gaze was fixed, unwavering. But not exactly on me. I quickly looked back down at my screen, the comforting numbers no longer feeling so certain.

A shadow fell over my monitor. I looked up, and Brenda was there, standing right next to my desk. The pale face was still there, but the smile had twisted into something ugly, a sneer that showed all her teeth. Her eyes wide and unblinking were almost fixed on me. Then she lunged. There was no warning, no scream, just the sickening crack of her hand against my jaw. I fell backward in my chair, scrambling to get away, but she was on me in a flash. 

My mug went flying, and hot coffee scalded my leg, but I barely registered the pain. All I could feel was the weight of her body on mine, the smell of hazelnut coming back, and the cold unyielding strength of her hands around my throat. The humming of the lights above grew louder and higher until it was the only sound in the world. I clawed at her hands, but they were unyielding, like a vise. The air left my lungs in one final wheezing gasp, and the edges of my vision began to go gray.

Then, a shout. ""Brenda! What are you doing?"" It was Gary from marketing. I heard a thud and the scrape of a chair. Melissa the office admin/ cleaning person was there, too. I felt a jarring tug and a brief instant of blessed relief as Brenda's hands were ripped from my throat. I gulped in air, my lungs burning. I lay there gasping, as Gary and Melissa struggled to hold Brenda back.

Brenda wasn't fighting them, not really. She was limp, her head lolling. Her ugly sneer was gone, replaced by a look of utter bewilderment. When they finally managed to get her a few feet away, she just stood there, her hands clasped together, trembling. Her pale face was now a mask of confusion, her wide eyes darting from me, sprawled on the floor, to the two people holding her.

""Why am I.?"" she said in a whisper, her tone small and shaking. ""What.?"" She looked at her hands, then at me. A wave of understanding washed over her, it seemed. Tears welled up into her eyes. ""Oh my god. what did I do? I'm so sorry, I don't."" Melissa was trying to figure out what had just happened, her brow furrowed in confusion, and Gary was helping me up. My neck ached and there were red welts on my throat, but I wasn't really hurt. I was just. shaken. 

As I stood there, leaning against my desk, watching Brenda, I could feel anger welling up from the confusion in my face and breath. But the look of genuine horror and remorse mixed on her face was heartbreaking. It was clear she wasn't herself. She couldn’t even say what happened for any certainty. I knew that if I told them what had happened, she'd be fired, maybe even arrested. She'd lose everything. ""It's okay,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""It's a mistake. She just. slipped and fell. It was an accident."" 

Everyone was staring at me like I was insane, their eyes flicking from the fresh marks on my throat up to the wild, panicked expression on Brenda's face. Gary opened his mouth to protest it, but I just held his gaze, my stare daring him to contradict me. ""She tripped,"" I said, the words sounding strange and clumsy in my mouth. ""Lost her balance. She reached out to grab me so she wouldn't fall, that's all. I'm fine. She's fine."" 

My voice was a little stronger now, a little more convincing. ""It was a total accident."" Melissa looked from me to Brenda and back again, her expression shifting slowly from confusion to grudging acceptance. Gary, still supporting me, just shook his head slightly, but he said nothing. I wasn't going to be the reason her life was ruined. Not when she had no idea what she'd done. Not when she was more scared than I was. 

""I'm fine,"" I repeated a last time. ""Really. It was just an accident.""",1,1765182381.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1ph781z,https://www.reddit.com/r/l4l/comments/1ph781z/32_femme_lesbian_stuck_in_idaho/,32 femme Lesbian stuck in Idaho,"Hi everyone! I'm putting myself out there finally. Hoping to find something meaningful with someone. 💙
A little about me:
I'm 32, typically more femme presenting. But I do sometimes lean a little more tomboy. Overall, You won't catch me without eyeliner but I like to pair that with my docs and a backwards hat sometimes. I'm 5'6"" and average build but I work out regularly and would say I'm moving towards athletic. White (pale as hell) and I currently have blue hair. 🥰  I've been told I have a bad case of resting bitch face. But I promise I'm kind and I do smile! I'm a little witchy, a little weird, and love to be silly together. 

I'm a later in life lesbian. At the beginning of the year I separated from my husband, who I have been in a relationship with for 11 years. We had been poly for the majority of our relationship, And I dated women during that time.  We have a child together (3.5 years old) So we co-parent and I still currently live with him. I was a stay-at-home mom for the last 2 years. So over the next year I am basically starting my life over and working on getting my own place. Him and I have a good relationship and will continue to be very involved in each other's lives as we raise our child. 
This unfortunately means I am unable to relocate outside of my home state. 
I am open to more children, but I'm not sure that I would do well with another pregnancy. I am open to adoption, or welcoming someone else's existing children in as my own. 

I have a love for the outdoors, but during the winter I won't hesitate to snuggle up inside with a book or movie. I enjoy cooking and baking, spending time with my child, and wandering stores debating on if I really need another coffee mug. I was raised in a small conservative town, so I own firearms but I am firmly liberal leaning. I will protect myself and my family, but I will also protect those who can't protect themselves. 

The spicy side 🔥:
I am involved in my local kink community. I enjoy being a rope bottom and fire bottom, but my favorite by far is impact. I am in control of many areas of my life. Kink is where I release that control. I have done impact scenes in front of large groups and I enjoy participating in kink events usually on a monthly basis.
I am confident in my sexuality, and have no desire to date men going forward. However, I do bottom for men for kink situations. Within those situations, I don't have sex with men. I am very clear about my boundaries and what I expect with kink dynamics. 

What I'm hoping to find:
I would love to find a masc lesbian or afab non-binary person. Preferably close to my age range. 10 to 15 years older is possible. Younger, I would like to stay around a year gap. Similar build, or taller/more athletic would be ideal, but not a requirement! If you can throw me over your shoulder or toss me around, I would melt. Given my kink dynamics, I'd hope to find someone who is either more dominant, or a switch. I do get a wild hair to top from time to time. 😉 I would be willing and comfortable being monogamous for someone who checks all of my boxes. But if you are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with a kink dynamic, I would hope that would be up for a honest conversation. 
Overall, I want someone who sees me, and makes me feel valued. I'm a hopeless romantic and believe in the power of the universe leading me to my person. My love languages are acts of service and words of affirmation. Quality time is a close contender as well. I enjoy showing love with almost all of the love languages, but I do struggle with gift giving because I tend to overthink it. 😅 
If this sounds like you, please reach out. Hopefully you read this and think ""this could be my future wife"" 💙",0,1765182348.0,l4l,0,0.5,False

Trained to take over from her Father, Zalia is shocked when her best friends turn against her, but Zalia has found the perfect way to get back at them. 

She will humiliate every male that thinks a female shouldn’t be in a Pack’s leadership and she will show her best friends what they will be missing in their leadership.

\*\*\*

Zalia

My name is Zalia, I am a twenty-six-year-old Lycan and the future Gamma of the Moon Stone Pack. Our Pack is the largest Pack after Mystic Moon Pack, the King’s Pack. 

Also, our Pack is one of the few Packs in our Kingdom that is a mix of Werewolves and Lycans, with my family being one of the Lycan families that live in our Pack.

Our current leadership each has a male and female Pup, but unlike what everyone seems to think, our future leadership will have two males and one female. Because I am the first born Pup of our Pack’s Gamma, it means that I will be taking over from my Father when they step down, something I have been training for since I turned fifteen.

As the future Gamma, I am smart enough to know how to take every precaution to counter any attack. Our Alpha has seen it happen over and over again during our training, that I have been putting the future Alpha and Beta on their asses more than once and I can see that our Alpha always had to hide his laughter at the embarrassment his Son faced. 

Luckily every Pup in his Pack was raised the same way, and no one got angry when they got their asses kicked by me. No one ever treated me differently because I am a female; they always listened if I pointed out where they made a mistake and most of our Warriors have grown because of it.

I am very contented with my position and my Pack. The only thing that annoys me is the Pack Visits we have to conduct every now and then: I need to tag along but no one in other Packs even realize that I am my Pack’s future Gamma.

When we arrive at Onyx Moon Pack, the Alpha and Luna are looking down on me, and they act as if I am the help.

This has been going on for a few years now and each time it gets more difficult to hold my tongue during Pack visits, but Alpha Brad had been very clear in his warning towards me: I am not allowed to harm anyone, just because I am better trained than most Pups I meet.

“You, get me some coffee.” Layla, Alpha Mike’s Daughter, is pointing me. 

“Why don’t you get off your lazy butt and do it yourself.” I growls at her and Donovan, our future Alpha and Gibson, our future Beta, start laughing their asses off. I doubt anyone has ever spoken to her like that and the dumbfounded look on her face is priceless. 

Her high pitched cry for her Daddy has me rolling down the aisles with Twilight, my Lycan. For Goddess' Sake, She is an adult and she should be able to fend for herself. 

Donovan stops laughing the moment Alpha Mike steps into the room, but there is no way on earth I can stop laughing and I don’t even try to hide it. 

Alpha Brad tries to talk to Alpha Mike in a normal fashion, but Alpha Mike is demanding an apology from us for making his Daughter cry, and we just stare at him in surprise. Donovan actually does apologized to her, but I flat out refuse to do it and Alpha Brad knows better than to try and force me. 

Alpha Mike is unaware of my temper and gets into my face, yelling at me to apologize to his Daughter. 

“Why on earth would I apologize to her? She acts like a spoiled six-year-old, maybe you should have raised her better.” I yell back at him and my Lycan Twilight nearly takes over control when he raises his hand, and he is lucky that Alpha Brad steps between the two of us. 

I would have kicked Alpha Mike’s butt if he had tried to hit me. Alpha Brad is very aware of the fact that I would have been able to take him down. 

This is why I don't like Pack visits so much, some act like everyone owes them something and as if they're so much better than the rest of us. On top of that there is the way they talk to anyone who isn't of an Alpha bloodline, would it hurt them to treat someone with some respect? 

Other than that accident, some even thought I was there because I was Alpha Brad’s mistress and some thought I was sleeping with Donovan or Gibson. None of them even thought I was there because I am Donovan’s Gamma.

I was surprised when Donovan didn’t correct them, but I blamed it on their Daughter who was ogling Donovan and her relentless attempts to get him to go with her. 

I am grateful that Alpha Brad instilled a great respect for the Mate-bond in all of us at an early age: you don’t sleep with everyone that is willing and you certainly don’t sleep with someone from your own Pack. 

I never slept with a male, even though many have offered but I shot each and every one of them down and I might have punched a handful of them for not taking a hint.

If Donovan or Gibson get agitated with females that can’t take No for an answer, they go for a run or to spar at the training grounds of the Pack we visit. 

I can’t do that because no one knows that I am the future Gamma of Moon Stone Pack and that means that they don’t allow me to train with the members of the Packs we visit. I don’t have an outlet for my frustrations during a visit. 

I always envy them because I can’t even go for a run without a Luna or Alpha talking down to me. No one questions Donovan and Gibson when they take off for a run or some training. 

That's why I chose to keep to myself during the visit—it causes trouble if I interact too much with those bimbos and assholes. 

Aside from my run-in with Alpha Mike, I stayed quiet the entire time, and he nearly paid the price for all the crap I heard during the visit.

Another thing I dislike about these visits is the fact that everyone tells me to eat less. I need the food to keep up my stamina and I need a lot of stamina for the patrols I run every day. I am a Lycan, it isn’t as if I will become fat and even if some of it sticks to my bones I don’t care.

Every Luna would tell me that I needed to watch what I was eating, that my Mate wouldn’t appreciate a Mate that ate so much, and that my Mate wouldn’t like a Mate with a size more. 

Ha, a size more. I have a size six and am proud of it, I don’t need to look like a stick.

Most of the Lunas are so thin I fear they would be blown away during a storm and still they complain about being overweight. 

During this visit though it was almost every female that made remarks about my food consumption and from the corner of my eye, I had seen Donovan and Gibson laughing, but I thought they were just commenting on the females through their mind-link. 

I am just glad that this visit is over, but unfortunately we have to attend to another grand meeting next: a meeting between the Alphas of all the Packs in the Kingdom and the Alpha King.

For over a decade I have been forced to come to this meeting. I didn’t have a choice though, our King demands that the future leadership of a Pack start attending after the future Alpha turns sixteen.

“Calm down, Zalia. You have two months of peace and quiet.” Donovan says teasingly. 

“Okay, was it necessary to remind me of that? As if I am looking forward to spending four days with them and no way to get out of it or to get rid of the frustration by running border patrol.” I growl.

Chapter 2 The All Alphas Meeting

Zalia

The day is finally here, note the sarcasm. The annual All Alphas Meeting has arrived and I have been training or running border patrol most of the time. Anything to keep my mind off the next four days.

We were taught that we needed to come to this meeting to learn how to get along with other Packs, but I think most Alphas use it to find a suitable Mate with a high rank for the future leadership of their Pack.

Because every Pup of the Alpha, Beta and Gamma that is fifteen or older tags along, just to make sure they get noticed by other Packs, and maybe a male or female takes an interest.

For our Pack it means that right now, our Alpha and his two Pups, Donovan and his baby sister Elinor are present, our Beta’s two Pups, Gibson and his baby sister Kali are also here, and then there is me and my baby Brother Slater. 

As usual, we are the first Pack to arrive, and a Warrior escorts us to our table in the largest meeting room.

More Alphas walk in right behind them and each of them has the Pups of their leadership with them. The males are dressed properly, but the females… I am not sure how to describe it. Some are wearing a skirt and top, but it looks as if they bought them a size or two too small as it barely covers their skin.

I wonder why their parents allow them to dress like that, my Father would kick me back up the stairs to my room to change. 

“What is so funny, Gamma?” Donovan asks through the mind-link and when I tell him my train of thought, Dad nearly chokes on the sip of water he took.

“You’re straight I would kick you back up the stairs. I don’t understand their parents either.Why would they allow their Daughters to degrade themselves like that?” Dad growls through the mind-link and we are all laughing as we see another female walk in, wearing a dress that leaves almost all of her skin exposed.

I scrunch my nose as I smell so many males and females covered in a thick, lingering scent and I nearly gag when a future Gamma sits down at the table behind us. 

“Ugh, couldn’t he have showered?” Kali shouts over the mind-link as a male sits down behind us, the scent drifting our way and I ask her how he is supposed to do that if it happened only a few minutes ago.

“Can you imagine that you would be able to smell almost all of them covered in that promiscuous scent?And not all of them did it with their Mate.” I ask her and every head snaps in my direction.

Our Alpha tells us that he feels sorry for us as we as Lycans, are more affected by it than Werewolves. 

“Yeah, right. How often have you asked Dad if someone smelled of that scent that wasn’t his Mate?” I ask him.

Dad starts laughing out loud and I know I hit the bullseye with my question. Kali and Elinor giggle as our Alpha turns slightly red. 

By the time everyone is seated, my Brother, my Father and I are breathing through our mouths and even the others have trouble breathing normally.

Today is for the King to welcome everyone to the venue and for everyone to mingle before the Pack meetings begin tomorrow, something I really dislike to be a part of. Most of these Alphas have outdated ideas about females or twisted ideas about fated Mates and I don't like the way they always stare at me or ignore my presence.

We all stand when the Royal Family finally enters the room and I see each of them scrunching their noses. “Looks like they smell it too.” Elinor says and I just nod my head. 

I had already seen the barely dressed female saunter over to a table near the stage and I felt sorry for whoever she came for. She sits down next to Mavka, the future Royal Gamma’s Mother, and both of them are talking softly as the female’s eyes keep wandering towards the stage.

Whoever she is after doesn’t respond and the scowl on her face becomes worse by the minute and I hope that none of the males in this room are her fated Mate. 

I hear Twilight, my Lycan, giggle at my thoughts. “What about females?” She asks and I am so thankful for the training Dad gave me or I would have been rolling down the aisles here.

The Royal Family allows everyone their five minutes of gossip. I never understood the meaning of it and I doubt I ever will. Why would you want to discuss which male could be your Mate? 

But then again only the future Royal Gamma is unmated and I actually feel sorry for him. “That is why she is sitting with Mavka.” Twilight states, “She must be after her son.”

Deimos

Four days of dealing with Alphas and Lunas that want to shove their Daughter in my bed, four days of my Mother Mavka trying to help those Alphas and Lunas. I am wishing I could just disappear while Goliath, my Lycan, is growling in my head at the prospect of the next four days and I know he will snap at our Mother eventually.

No matter what either one of us says to her, she keeps bringing females with her and I am glad the King told her she was no longer allowed to bring a guest when she comes over for dinner, but now she tries to force me to come home for dinner. Which I refuse to do and luckily I have my duties as the future Royal Gamma as an excuse.

My parents were chosen Mates and I know Dad regrets that he didn’t wait for his fated Mate. Mother started cheating on him almost immediately and when she was pregnant with me he refused to believe her until Doc could prove that I was his Son. After that he went to see the King and he was allowed to reject her on the grounds of infidelity. 

Dad raised me on his own, but Mother stayed in the picture hoping that I would get her back in to the Palace.  

It was my eighth birthday when I decided I didn’t want her there and she tried to persuade me by telling me that she was my Mother and that she loved me.

“Mother, you don’t love me. You just love the fact that I will be the next Royal Gamma and you want to take advantage of that status. The only time I see you is when you know that a lot of important Wolves and Lycans will be around, hoping you can find another chosen Mate to give you status and to cheat on.” 

Even Goliath hates her and her Wolf for putting their own needs before those of their Pup. Yes, even my Mother’s Wolf had been neglecting us, which is rare as a Wolf or Lycan’s instinct will always be to put their Pup first.

Ammon, our future King, pulls me from my thoughts as we walk towards the meeting room and we both stick our noses in the air, “Ugh, this is going to be one tough day.” He says as we both smell the promiscuous scent and I know it will hit us full force the moment we step into the room.

“Why is it necessary for them to screw around just before these meetings?” Asha, Ammon’s Mate, asks over the mind-link and Ammon decides to give her multiple reasons for it to distract her from the smell, unlike us she has more trouble hiding her disgust with these Wolves and Lycans and as the future Queen she can’t show those emotions outward.

I keep my eyes on our seats, but as every year I am surprised to see the females of Moon Stone Pack. They are the only ones that actually dress like leaders and I smile as I see all three of them doing the same thing I am. “Asha, I see at least a few females know how to behave themselves.” I say with a chuckle.

I nearly lose my temper when I see Mavka, my so-called Mother, at a table near the stage and besides her is a female dressed in… well, I am not sure what it is supposed to be. If that is meant to turn a male on, then I am probably broken and when I say that through our mind-link, Asha nearly trips up, it is a good thing Ammon always has a good grip on her.

Chapter 3 Food

Deimos

We sit down in our seats as the King motions everyone to quiet down and it takes a few minutes before everyone is quiet, except of course for a few females that think talking about whatever is more important. The King keeps quiet until a few of the Alphas finally realize it is because of the females with them that the King isn’t speaking.

Goliath points out that everyone at the table of Moon Stone Pack has a smirk on their faces and I have to stifle a smile as I look at each of them, “The females are better at hiding what they are looking at than the males.” I say to Goliath and we both chuckle as one of the females shoves her elbow into the side of the future Alpha.

I see the brunette smiling as she looks past us for a second and I wonder what is so funny, “Someone is trying to get your attention, Son.” Dad says through the mind-link and I already know what he is talking about, probably also the reason why the brunette is smiling.

The King’s speech is something we all worked on and we tried to get as many words in without actually saying a thing, it was good fun making this speech. 

Our Queen had made the start of the speech in which he welcomes the Alphas and Lunas for attending and Asha was the one to put in the Pups that were accompanying their parents.

We had laughed our asses off when she tried to find subtle ways to tell them to stop fooling around, but in the end she had managed to find a rather romantic way of putting the message out there. 

“Alphas and Lunas, your brought along the Pups of your current leadership and they will be our future.

A future we as the Royal Family have been granted already, we found a Daughter in your future Queen and our Son’s fated Mate. Something we all are longing for, something we are all waiting for and when we find our fated Mate we will become stronger and better.

Prince Ammon and Princess Asha had both been waiting for their fated Mate to step into their lives, and both of them want to express to all of you how grateful they are that they waited for the other to start their life’s journey, to have all the firsts as adults with one another.” He says.

I know he had struggled with that last sentence and he had thrown a few things my way every time I laughed my head off, he had choked on the words every single time. I hear Ammon laughing in our mind-link as the King looks from Ammon to Asha and we all see the look he gives Asha.

Eryx, the future Royal Beta, and I had taken it upon ourselves to put the meetings into the speech, but like Asha, we struggled to put down a lot of words that meant absolutely nothing and we needed help from the others to get anything on the paper. The King had said it was never easy to say a lot without actually saying anything.

At least we got the chance to practice, because in the future we have to do this for ourselves and it is not something I am looking forward to. 

“In the next few days, we all hope to have good and meaningful discussions about a variety of subjects, from training to security and from Balls to meetings.

We all hope that by the time each and every one of you goes home, that it will have been a fruitful event in one way or another and that we all can look back on a successful meeting.” He says as we see a lot of the Wolves and Lycans smile, but Asha points out that the members from Moon Stone Pack look as if they know that the King actually said nothing at all.

“Lunch has been served in the main dining room. I ask you kindly to stay seated until a Warrior comes to your table and he will guide you to your table in the dining room. It will be the table you will be seated at during every meal for the next few days.” He says before we all get up and follow him out of the meeting room.

We get some food from the buffet before we sit down and the Queen nods her head at her assistant, giving the unspoken order to let the others join us for lunch. The first Pack to be seated is Moon Stone Pack and they are at the table closest to ours.

The Alpha and Gamma sit down while the Pups walk over to the buffet and the brunette is joggling three plates with ease. I know everyone is watching her as she fills each plate with food, before she heads back to their table and places a plate in front of the Alpha and the Gamma and both of them thank her with a smile.

Many females look at their table with anger or envy in their eyes, but I know it is an unspoken rule that Moon Stone Pack gets seated near the Royal Family and I know they will not cause any problems with us. They like to keep to themselves just like we do.

Every female that walks to the buffet looks at our table for as long as they can, but none of us respond to it and I can feel their anger growing more and more. I see them walking in their high heels and it doesn’t look very steady to me, but with a plate of food they sway even more on their legs.

I keep my eyes on my plate as I hear Eryx chuckle when a blond nearly loses her balance. 

“Who on earth let her walk off without a guard?” Asha snarls through our mind-link and Sila, Eryx’s Mate, asks her why she is so concerned. 

“What will happen if that plate of food flies out of her hand and onto another Alpha’s Daughter?” Asha asks.

Zalia

This food is amazing and I can’t wait for everyone to have had their first serving. I need to get to that buffet again. Twilight agrees with me as a blond walks past us swaying on her high heels. 

“Why would you wear those if you can’t even walk on them?” I ask over the mind-link and as expected the males call out in unison, “Because they think it is attractive.”

I stare at each of them before I ask over the mind-link, “They really think it is attractive that they look drunk?”

Kali and Elinor burst out in laughter with me. Slater just chuckles as Dad shakes his head and Donovan just stares at me. And as always Gibson thinks my question is sincere and answers that they meant the high heels.

“Okay, you did notice that the Queen is also wearing high heels, but she doesn’t walk around as if she is drunk.” I say as I look at him and he finally realizes I had been pulling their chains. 

“Zalia, how did patrol go last night?” our Alpha asks to change the topic we are discussing.

“When I got there at eleven there was nothing to report, but about an hour into my shift, we had two Rogues at our eastern border. When they saw me they thought I was ripe for the picking, but Twilight decided to show them that we don’t back down from anyone and both were dead in a minute or so.

We didn’t have any other problems during the rest of our shift and before we left, I checked in with morning patrol, but between six and eight there had been nothing to report.” I answer him as I ask Kali through the mind-link if the buffet is finally free again.

She tells me that everyone has gotten their plate of food, but before I can get up my Dad growls at me, “Zalia, you are telling me you stayed out on patrol all night, that you haven’t slept at all?” He says and as I get up to head for the buffet I say, 

“Just like always, Dad. Why would going to this meeting need to change my routine? 

I didn’t ask to be dragged down here. I didn’t ask anyone to make up this rule that the Pups of our leaderships need to be paraded in front of everyone and I sure didn’t ask anyone to force the future leaderships to be present at every boring meeting.

Now, if you’ll excuse me or not for that matter, I need some more food before Twilight decides she is going to eat and then it won’t be from a plate.” 

I walk away knowing full well that everyone in the dining room heard his question and my answer and I know that is what Dad was going for.

I keep my eyes on the buffet, but I can see a lot of males staring at me and I know I will get a lot of questions during our mingling session after lunch. Yippie, already looking forward to it, Not. At least now all of them will know that I am a Gamma’s Daughter and that means that their attentions will most likely be far from sexual.

“You run border patrol often?” I hear the King’s voice ask as the entire room goes quiet and I turn towards him as I answer him, “Yes, Your Majesty. I run border patrol in the same shift as my team, just because I am the Daughter of our Pack’s Gamma doesn’t mean I have to act like a spoiled little brat.

I can take care of myself as I have been training since I turned seven and I started running border patrol when I was forced to come to these meetings. I told our Alpha if I was old enough to be dragged down here, I sure was old enough to run border patrol.

Just between you and me, Your Majesty. I think running border patrol is a lot safer than coming here.” I make a little bow before I head back to our table and I can hear the King chuckle behind me, everyone at the Royal table is chuckling and giggling.

Deimos

How does she look so good after missing a good night’s sleep? I always feel like crap after running patrol at night and I always need most of the day to sleep it off. Goliath is rolling down the aisles when she answers her Father and I hear Ammon laughing through our mind-link.

“Dad, can we keep her?” He asks and I know exactly why he is asking, she isn’t shy with her opinions. 

Chapter 4 Unfriendly Looks

Deimos

The Royal Family can’t talk like that, but luckily for them, we can and having her around would be so refreshing. The only answer he gets is in the form of the King getting up to walk towards the buffet.

She is joggling three plates again and from watching her the first time, I know which plate is hers, it is filled more than that of her Alpha or her Father. 

“She needs it if she runs border patrol on a regular basis.” Goliath says and the moment I hear her say that running patrol is safer, I know that I want to get to know her a whole of a lot better.

Maybe I can even convince her to stick to my side and chase away all the females that want the last spot within the Royal ranks. 

“Deimos.” Our queen calls out to me and as I turn my head towards her I know I am in trouble, “How is it that a Gamma’s Daughter from a Pack almost as large as Mystic Moon Pack can still function?

I mean, whenever you return from border patrol at night you need the rest of the day to sleep it off and she is walking around as if she just returned from a day at a spa.” Our Queen says loud enough for everyone to hear and I hear Zalia laughing at my expense, but I also take it as an opportunity.

“Your Majesty, I have no idea. Maybe Zalia is willing to keep me company for a while after lunch, see if I can figure out what her secret is or find out if she wants to become Prince Ammon’s baby Sister. After all he did ask if he could keep her.” I answer and Asha is in stitches as Ammon tries to object.

“Deimos, that is an excellent idea. If Zalia is willing to, of course.” The Queen says as she walks over to the buffet, she likes to get her own food whenever she can. 

“Of course I am willing to talk to the future Royal Gamma, Your Majesty. If I can help him figure out what he does wrong, we might be able to keep Prince Ammon from finding a replacement.” She answers.

My jaw drops while Ammon spits out the sip of coffee he took, and I can see that the King has trouble keeping a straight face.

“Your Majesty.” I hear Zalia say to our Queen, and we all look at her, “I think you need to check on your Mate, he looks a bit bloated.” She says with a straight face.

This time none of us can stop it as we burst out in laughter and I know that these few days will be very different from other years. I wonder why I never noticed her before. 

“We were always too busy avoiding Mavka and whatever female she brought along.” Goliath replies and I am afraid that he is correct.

Once everyone is finished with lunch, they get escorted back to the meeting room and I see that every table is filled with empty glasses and plates, some of them empty while others are still half full. I look at the table of Moon Stone Pack and not only is every glass and plate empty, they are also neatly stacked near the edge of the table.

We make our way over to Moon Stone Pack and it doesn’t take me long to figure out that Zalia is the first born to the Gamma, she will be taking over from her Father when he steps down. However, it doesn’t look like most males figured that out, and for a second born Beta or Gamma she would be a great catch.

Goliath growls at my train of thought and I chuckle as I realize he doesn’t like the prospect of her with another male. 

I step up next to Zalia to offer her my arm and I hear three males standing beside her growl, “Back off.” 

She growls back. “Do I have to spell out to you three idiots why Deimos asked me to join him?” 

Everyone stares at her when one of them asks her to please enlighten them.

“He is using me as a shield. He is the only one still unmated and that means the only one that might give a female some status. You and Gibson know this better than anyone, Donovan.” She points out and all three males stare at the floor.

“Sorry, Sis. It is just strange seeing you on the arm of a male, unless you are ready to smack him dead center to the ground.” The younger Pup says and Zalia introduces him as Slater, her baby Brother. 

“Good to know that he is protective of his Sister.” Goliath states.

Sila walks up to Slater and asks how serious he was with his statement. 

“I believe everyone heard her when she said she took out two Rogues last night. My Sister can defeat Donovan and Gibson and she has done so on more than one occasion.” He answers.

I stare at the 5”8 brunette by my side, she is wearing straight legged pants with a high waist and a short blazer that reaches her hips. A white tank top with scalloped edge and a V-neck under neath it, but I can’t tell if it is sleeveless or short sleeved and she has finished it off with black laced boots with a block heel.

The heels look to be about two or three inches and far better to walk on than the heels most females wear. She is confident as she wraps her arm around mine. 

“You will get a lot of glares, sorry for that.” I whisper in her ear and she giggles before she tells me she can handle it.

Zalia

I know I painted a target on my own back when I accepted Deimos’ request, but I am not one to walk away from a fight and it doesn’t matter if it is a physical fight or a verbal fight. Twilight doesn’t object when I wrap my arm around his and she just lies down in the back of my head, keeping an eye on our surroundings.

He wasn’t kidding when he said I would get glares and Twilight is on full alert as we walk further into the room. A female walks up to us to get Deimos’ attention which she doesn’t get. We both scrunch our noses at the same time and I wonder how long there had been between her leaving the dining room and us leaving.

“Hello, Deimos.” She says as she looks up at him and by holding her hands in front of her she manages to press her breasts together, making them almost jump out of her top. “I was hoping you could tell me a few things about what you do around here.” She continues. 

“Avoiding females like you.” Twilight responds.

She steps forward to try and place herself between Deimos and me, but Twilight makes sure I have a firm grip on his arm and she softly growls at the female. She turns to me with a shocked look on her face. 

“Sorry, my Lycan doesn’t like it when someone steps into our personal space.” I say loud enough for a few females to hear.

“Well, then maybe you should go back to your little Pack and leave the real males to females like me.” She says as she looks me dead in the eye, my Dad warns me over our mind-link to behave myself and I tell him I always behave myself.

I turn to Deimos with a serious look on my face before I ask, “What does an unreal male look like?” and I see quite a few Wolves and Lycans turn away. 

“I have no idea.” He says and he looks as if he is thinking about an answer to give me.

“I might have an idea, but I doubt it is a good idea to say it out loud.” He says while he still looks as if he is thinking about something. The moment the female asks him to say what he thought of, I realize he had been setting her up. 

He leans towards me as he says, “I think she meant her friend on batteries.” I know exactly what he means, but I really can’t help myself.

“She has a robot that works on batteries, that is cool.” I say as I look at Deimos and I hear a few Wolves and Lycans choke on their laughter, while Deimos is turning slightly red at my words. At least we got rid of the female as she runs out of the room with a face as red as a lobster.

The sunset cut slip thin across the horizon before I took my last exit. Nothing in the world rests on the eyes like the gold made over the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I’ve been driving for fourteen hours, and though I’ve had a few stops for gas, food, and coffee, this is the first actual stretch of rest I’ve been afforded. You can call me Red, my car is an abused Nissan Cube, her name is Darla. We live together. I’ve been homeless for six years now.

Despite how bad it might seem living the way I do. I’m not all gloom and misery. Life is simple, I drive places, I make money to get gas, and then I drive to more places. I’ve seen more countryside than most folks dream about. I’ve been on more roads than anyone I’ve ever heard of. The only thing I worry about is the closest pit-stop.

I’ve got Freedom from everything I could ever worry about. Jean Paul Sartre said we’re all doomed to be free. I disagree, I think the real doom is knowing you *could be* free, and knowing you’ll never take the chance. Don’t like your job? Quit. Don’t like your family? Leave. Don’t like your friends? Stop seeing them. You don’t wanna live with the consequences of those choices? Don’t make em.

Some nights pass quickly, Others nights aren’t as easy. Though I chose to live this way, the primal jelly inside my skull, the Part of me as old as stone, weeps like a sickly child for company. Humans are social animals after all. I hate those nights. To put my head at ease, I play a game with other drivers.

Only on the lonely roads. I’ll find myself a car, and I’ll trail behind them. I don’t ride their ass or anything, I just stay by them. They have no idea where I’m going, they have no reason to fear me, they have nothing to say. When you’re flying down Route-66 for three hours at four in the morning, having a car to drive with lets it all melt into halcyon road trips. A few hours in, they always peel away and then I’m alone, the jelly in my head is satisfied.

Sometimes I run into someone else doing the same. A car as rough as mine, a driver as tired as me, and trailing along as we both wait to go our separate ways. Whenever I run into a person like this, I do my best to follow their road as long as I can. This is a connection that means more to me. Makes me feel like I’m not the only ghost on the road. My life might sound a bit strange to people not in my place, though my place is a strange one to be.

Recently, I ran into a ghost who felt like a mirror on wheels. They drove a Black 1970 Ford pickup which wore its age like a whore wears perfume. The car felt like part of the road, and as I trailed behind I started to lose track of the hours. It felt different than the other people I’ve seen. Once Darla needed fuel, I pulled away so I could get her what she needed. I figured this shadow of mine would want their privacy back. Although to my surprise the Ford followed. 

What was odd, was that at first I didn’t feel uneasy about it. The roads were kind, the weather still. Stars poured out across the night, our tires sung an empty song to the endless desert all around us. After a while I felt at home, and that’s when it terrified me. I felt a shackle snap shut around my throat. For a moment I felt like I had a brother again. With a lonely Gas Stop in the distance, I resolved to leave this Stranger, to forget this feeling.

I had walked into this nowhere Gas Station, the place reeking of cleaning chemicals and stale air. Crowded Aluminum Isles packed to bursting with fossilized candies, off brand Beef Jerky, toiletries, and Cough Medicine. The Clerk was a woman in her fifties. Hair like dry white grass, skin like tissue stained by time. Her Sun-bleached uniform told of decades in the same place. She drank black coffee from a Styrofoam cup. The lines on her face dug in like canyons, cracked beside eyes mourning a life she could have had. She reminded me of my Mother.

She politely pretended not to watch as I roamed the isles, gathering what I needed. Bottled water, jerky, crackers, instant coffee, razors, shaving cream, batteries, duct tape, pliers, pills for caffeine, and sleep. Even with her in the room, I finally felt alone again.

“30 on 5.” I grunted, placing my items on the counter. I didn’t want to speak, my throat was dry.

She looked at me with those sad eyes, and smiled. “Got everythin’ ya need hun?” her voice was milk-candy, and cold hands.

I couldn’t muster much of a smile. I just nodded as pleasantly as I could. After the Driver followed me, I was here to forget. Part of me felt like I should help her, get some of the sadness out of her eyes somehow. Maybe a kind word, a smile, something? She told me what I owed.

“You have a nice day now darlin’.” she smiled, and sipped her coffee.

I went back to my Darla, content to get back on the road. Before I got to her door, the smell of leather and whiskey hit the back of my throat like buckshot.

“Heya Tex, nice drivin’ back there.” said the man “Fancy we getting’ to the same spot. Lass at the counter looks half dead tho, she any help?”

For a moment I thought he was in my head. He was layers of fine denim worn down by decades of use. Dark as a shadow, and slim as a knife. His face was a road map written by tobacco stains and bad choices. He had a voice like cigar smoke, and with that Black Ford behind him; I knew who he was right away. The Driver found me again.

I couldn't move as His eyes cut through me, they were a shade of ice. Two frozen mountaintops far into a valley I'd never want to visit. His stare nailed my tongue to the roof of my mouth, though the jelly in my head pried it loose.

  “Yep” I said, my throat dry, my voice disused.

“Good to hear, damn it’s been what, twelve hours since my last stop?” his accent was thick with brambles and hickory. “Where you headed there Tex?”

“Nowhere.” I replied. The Jelly was feasting on this, Something about this man was lighting torches of the past in my head.

“I’m headed past Nowhere myself, you lookin’ fer company? Since we’re both goin’ the same way figured I’d ask.” his voice became a shot of whiskey. It went down just as well.

“Sure.” was all I could manage. That word slipped out of me, because under his teeth, inside his tongue, I could hear my older brother. The last time I had seen him was at his funeral. He was wearing all black too.

“Well alright then! Lemme go check in the pit, grab some grub, and get in the ol’ beater. I’ll follow yer’ lead.” The Driver sauntered through the Nowhere Station like a cowboy into a silent movie.

As I fed Darla, I sat in a stunned silence. I felt violated, I felt lost. What part of my head is so fragile that it broke so easily. It was years since the Funeral. It has been over a decade since Family rang in me as anything other than regret. In the quiet pump of the gas, I heard my Father, in the stillness of the air I heard my Mother. In my breathing, was their violence. I thought I would never think of them again.

The Driver was still inside, I could see him through the window. He spoke to the sad-eyed cashier, and for an instant made eye contact with me over her shoulder. It felt like a Rattlesnake at my feet. He smiled like a razor-blade, and waved. I raised a hand, and waved back. Darla finished eating, I put the pump away. My hands began shaking. I drove away without a word. I did not wait for this shadow of a man to leave the building.

I told myself I was seeing things, that it was exhaustion clouding my vision. I knew there were only two people in that building. There were three cars in the lot. One for the Cashier, one for the Driver, one for me. I knew this as sure as I knew the sound of tires on asphalt. But in that moment when the Driver smiled, just over his shoulder, I saw my brother staring back at me.

I drove quiet, I focused on the wheel in my hands. I felt like a man falling off a building, trying to argue the ground out of the way. After two more hours, I decided to rest. I decided to leave the Man in Black behind me.

2

Another day dawned in gold through Darla’s windshield. The Sleep crusted in my eyes was blinked away through dry coughs, and gulps of water. I brushed my teeth, stepped onto the side of the road, pissed into the dirt, and was ready to drive again. I had gone north the whole of yesterday, up into the redwoods. Those trees were monolithic things. They might as well be ageless. Towering signposts to the past. They grew taller, and more vibrant than any other tree I have ever seen.

As I pulled back onto the road, Darla and I had peace again. I went through Jerky, listened to the Radio prattle on about the latest news, the traffic ahead, and the weather to come. Winding through the mountains, I saw car after car parked to admire the wilderness. People walking through Footpaths doing the same thing I am, looking for places in between their responsibilities.

People come to nature for freedom. They walk through the woods, light campfires, all to forget the places they left. The irony is their homes are no less natural than the woods. People pretend that humans aren’t nature”, but we are. No human building is different from a beaver dam. No cellphone is different than a whale song.

Humans make up rules, and gods, and stories to create something that comes out of nothing to save us from our freedom. Without these ideas, people have to face that just like any Lion starving because it can’t catch a gazelle, or any deer eaten by a pack of wolves, nothing comes out of the sky to stop it. Everything on earth is free, we only trick ourselves into thinking we aren’t. When I saw a familiar Black Ford in my rear-view mirror, I was reminded of that reality.

While I do my best to vanish into the road, The Driver following me might as well have put the sun on my back. His car reeked of timeless demands for attention. Everyone we passed looked. Everyone waved, everyone could tell he was following me. He drove in sync, never too close. He followed me for six hours, I did my best not to panic.

I told him I was going nowhere. He told me the same. There was nowhere I could stop which he couldn’t stop at too. He stuck through every red light, every turn, every detour. As time passed with the Driver behind me, his presence brought back memories. My brother teaching me to drive, my first car, the first girl I kissed. The first person I left on the side of the road. As the miles of memories piled up, I found myself as the child in my Father’s back seat.

Even alone with my Darla, I began to hear my parents argue. A memory so vivid I could taste the fear in my mouth. Each curse, each strike, each moment of fear tangible. Alone in the care of two people who knew nothing about care. The dull thud of my Father’s fist on the back of my Mother’s head. I could smell the rain on the road, feel the biting winter through the cracked windshields.

Beyond my memories rain began to pour. Darla provided a clear windshield, though couldn’t hide the shadow-car behind me. I hit a pothole, and in the noise I heard the cracking thump of my Mother’s face into the hood of my Father’s Volkswagen. The sound of her choking as his hands gripped around her throat.

Time passed overhead, the gauges on my dashboard and the weight of my eyelids began to beg for peace. The sound of childhood began to ring louder and louder. No matter the music I put on, no matter the places I drove; the Driver’s presence dragged every moment of my life back to me. The blur of tears obscured the road, Darla couldn’t clear my vision. My older brother's voice rang in my head as he held a knife to my Father’s throat.

“Touch her again, and I’ll fucking kill you.” he was 13, I was 9. That was the day I learned how free we really are.

I pulled off to a rest station. Parking spaces, faded signs, fetid toilets, and rotten showers. It was a crypt for the American Dream, a good place to bury these memories. Dutifully, the Ford pulled in as well. It parked with a modest distance, and the Driver got out. A cigarette in hand, he leaned on his hood and brought smoke to the air around him. I caught my breath as the Driver watched Darla and I.

Darla was warm, though I needed air to wash out all the dread in me. As I opened the door, the moist cold rushed at me like a bitter hug. The strike of it shook my senses back. I reached out my limbs to bring them back to life, and readied to cut ways with this mystery man. The downpour had started in earnest now, puddles underfoot forming a shallow lake. Even in the shadows, the smoke, and the rain, I could see the Driver’s eyes.

“Bout time you stopped Tex! Wheew, you weren’t kiddin’ bout nowhere.” He called across the rain.

“I wasn’t.” I said as I called back as I closed the distance between us.

“We bout there yet? Or we getting some sleep before the next stretch?” a dry chuckle cracked through his words.

“why are you following me?” I asked, I wanted to get through this.

He smiled.

“I was waiting’ fer you to ask me that.” his voice put the rattlesnake at my feet again “I wanted to know why *you* were following *me.*” Then his words made the snake bite.

“You noticed.” I tried to sound sure of myself, though the venom in his words already had me.

“Hard not to, yer car ain’t exactly subtle.” he nodded towards where I was parked. “How long you been out here?”

“Long enough to know I like to be left alone.” I replied, as I moved between the Driver and Darla.

“Well then you ain’t been out long enough, you drive like a stalker.” He tossed his cig, and lit another.

I wasn’t going to argue, I just wanted him to go away. I had no idea what to say, how to handle this. It was years since I was last in a place like this, years since I left my Mother behind. Left everything behind. I was rusty, before I could say anything, he spoke again.

“Ya don’t want me to follow ya? Fine, I’ll be on my way. S’just when I noticed you, I felt like you might *need* someone to drive along with.” He offered me a smoke.

Without thinking I took it. He handed me a lighter, we both smoked in silence for a time. As we did I could feel the turn of the earth under my feet.

“I appreciate it, and yes sometimes I just need friends on the road.” I finished smoking, threw the butt away, and began to walk back to Darla. “Thanks for the smoke, but I prefer more anonymous company. I’m leavin’. Don’t fuckin’ follow me.”

“Well Yer welcome Tex! thanks for the miles.” The Driver stood there, His eyes still fixed.

When I got behind the wheel, I realized why the Driver’s eyes bore through me. Why did his voice put such fear in my veins? I pulled out from the rest stop, and went along to find a better place to sleep. When I think back to the night My Father left, It’s not the screaming, the tears, the threats, or even the rain I remember most. It’s my Father’s eyes. The way he looked at me as I curled into myself in the back seat. The way he looked at me with his eldest son holding a knife to his throat. The way we locked eyes before he walked out into the night. The Driver, with all his mystery, all the smoke, all the miles on his face had those same eyes.

I got my silence back after a while. I spent time winding through the mountains, looping back into the Redwoods again, and again. Any back road I could find, any isolation from the world I could afford myself. Even in my freedom, the meeting with that man made me feel naked. I’m no longer afraid of the freedom I have. I haven’t been for years. The only thing that scares me, is the freedom other people hold. Nature is fair, you either are or you aren’t. You are safe, or you are not. You are hungry, or you are sated. You are alive, or you are dead.

The road, for all I talk about the freedom it has, does come with rules. Speed limits, traffic laws, parking restrictions. It’s an extension of Humans nature into Nature. It’s freedom with training wheels. I forget that from time to time. I glorify my disconnection from it all, but I’ve still got Darla. I’ve still got the road. I wanted to shake off the night, to shake off the Driver. So I found a mountain trail made of dirt. I found somewhere more “natural” than “Natural”. The search brought comfort, reassurance.

In the early house of the night I found myself on the dirt I was hunting for. A shoulder I could rest on. Trees enveloping me away from anything that could chain me to the past. As the rain let up, I was comfortably alone again. Darla kept me safe, old blankets kept me warm. I was eager to get the night behind me, and move on to another place ahead. As I thought of places to get next as everything went blissfully black.

I don’t know how many hours later, I woke up. A pure still dark mixed with the sound of branches in the wind was everything. I felt confused, it was still night, the stress of everything must have made me sleep like shit. I reached for the wheel, but found nothing. I figured I must’ve just been confused. That’s when I realized I was unexpectedly cold. I began to notice how different the air felt around me. Then I saw it, Darla’s doors were open, and I was yards away on the ground.

My eyes widened as I began to adjust to the dark. My legs were jelly as I rose to my feet. Fear ate at my stomach as blood rushed through me. Slowly, I walked towards Darla. The Driver and Passenger door were wide open, she was still off. I scrambled to the driver's seat, and shut the doors as fast as I could. I checked the back seat. I locked every door. My heart thundered in my chest, Darla’s engine roared to life to match it. Although before I could drive away, I saw it.

Darla’s headlights cut the dark ahead of me, and there he was. Between the Redwoods, towering into the night sky, The Driver stood in front of his car. Parked just at the edge of the shoulder, He puffed his cigarette, and smiled.

“Heya Tex.” he said, clear as day.

I fled. I drove as far, and as fast as I could. I didn’t pay attention to which state I ended up in, I didn’t care about where I was going. All I could do was peer over my shoulder begging to not see the Man in Black.",3,1765182240.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

A few questions:

do I splurge on a grinder and get the timemore 064s with bambino (I would need to buy the bambino) OR do I do I ask for the DF54/bambino for the holidays (would be covered by multiple family members pooling my gifts).

I guess the question is, is grinder more important than machine? My ex had timemore and GCP but I dont think he modded it so I think it will be a step up in consistency going to the bambino from an un modded GCP. I dont want to figure out modding rn so I dont think GCP will be a good fit currently.

I mainly (85% of the time) like to drink pure shots of espresso and am not planning on using a milk steamer much, so I assume the regular bambino is the better buy.

I may occasionally also do pour over/regular coffee - which obv Df54 would not be ideal for that. Would baratza ESP be a better fit or any other grinder you can think of? Are there any other questions I should be asking myself when trying to figure out what machine or grinder to get? Are manual grinders worth it?? Any opinions based on this info?

1ph746e,https://www.reddit.com/r/financestudents/comments/1ph746e/how_i_stopped_being_broke_by_week_3_every_month/,How I stopped being broke by week 3 every month as a student,"So last month my card got declined buying a $3.5 energy drink at 7-eleven. Checked my account $2.15 left and it was only the 23rd. And this is wasn't even the first time this happened either.

I split a 2bed with my roommate about half a mile from campus, Rent's $650/month plus utilities (like $70). Between my part-time gig at the campus bookstore (bringing home around $1,200/month after taxes) and like $400 help from my parents, I start each month with **$1,600 total**. After rent and utilities thats $880 left for literally everything else (food, laundry, going out, whatever). Should be enough right?

I dont have a car so i usually walk everywhere, campus is literally a 10min walk. But week 1-2 when i have money im out here buying impulsive things. daily starbucks before my 9am ($6-7), doordash 3-4x a week cause im too tired to cook (like $22-30 per order). Taking ubers to the grocery store. random convenience store runs for energy drinks and snacks. Week 3 hits and im panicking. Week 4? Living off boxed mac n cheese and ramen, dodging my friends when they wanna grab food cause im broke.

One sunday i sat down and see my bank account where everything went:

* $150 on starbucks (5 days/week)
* $330 on delivery apps
* $110 on random convenience store stuff (energy drinks snacks impulsive buys)
* $50 on laundry (once a week, like $12/week)
* $70 on ubers
* $60 on going out with friends
* $35 on toiletries and random stuff

Thats like $805 out of $880. literally only $75 left and i havent even bought real groceries yet. No wonder i was eating ramen by week 4.

I knew I needed to SEE where my money was going in real time not just panic when my accounts empty. My friend advice me to track my daily spending, using budgeting apps like [iSpend AI](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ispend-ai-money-manager/id6754285869), [Money Manager](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/money-manager-expense-budget/id560481810), etc. So figured id try it.

Main thing that helped me with budgeting app, was seeing how much i have left each day not what i spent. Made me think twice before ordering doordash lol. Set up budget limit for each category too, gave myself like $80/month for coffee so i didnt feel guilty just had to stick to it.

Ngl i'm not suddenly saving hundreds. but now I:

* Get starbucks 2x week instead of daily
* Cook basic stuff most nights, order in maybe once a week
* Budget $120 for groceries which helps a ton
* Have like $100-120 left end of month
