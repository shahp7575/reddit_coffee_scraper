1p9hody,https://i.redd.it/wfzrwqx2y44g1.jpeg,Anyone else miss those early 2000s chatrooms and cyber café days? I made a tiny one out of nostalgia.,"Last night I was getting bored and scrolling X, and suddenly I saw a post about those **early 2000s chatrooms**. And it really brought back that old feeling. When the internet was simple… no rules, no pressure, no fancy apps. Just a nickname, a few strangers, and pure adda.

As a Bangali, I think many of you from Kolkata will get this. Those cyber café days… slow net, Orkut scraps, Yahoo Messenger, random chats with people you’d never meet again. Everything felt lighter, more honest.

Out of that nostalgia, I ended up making a small chatroom more like a tiny café corner on the internet. Very simple. No login, no history, nothing stored. Just only a nickname and your message, whatever you say exists only while you’re there, then it just disappears.

You can chat with strangers and make new friends… or create your own little circle and talk with your buddies. It’s fun, private, and quiet good for a peaceful chat with someone special or just some silly banter with your group.

Nothing big, nothing modern, just something I built because I genuinely miss that older internet vibe when things felt human.

Wife’s dad and aunt lived with their mother (wife’s grandmother) for decades. The aunt had many major health problems. Dad is in decent shape for 70 yo but drinks daily, takes pills he’s not prescribed, smokes, etc. The grandmother cared for both of them until she passed away about three years ago. The aunt just passed away about two months ago. Her dad is an absolute recluse. He doesn’t leave his bedroom except to get coffee and go outside to smoke. He’s been this way for 20 years or more. No family functions, barely will go to the store, hasn’t been more than 20 minutes from their house in over 20 years. 
     Here’s the issue. The aunt passed away and he was 900 miles from us and the rest of his family, now by himself with his mom and sister gone. We moved him up north to be near us so we can help him out, as he’s aging. We had this conversation multiple times over the last several years and agreed we would get him his own apartment near us. His new apartment is supposed to be ready in two weeks so he’s staying with us until then. Now that it’s time, my wife keeps saying she feels bad for him and he’d be better off just staying in our basement. No lease has been signed yet and I feel like I’m being pressured to move him in our house. 
     We just got her 24 year old daughter out of our basement and got our house back after three years of her irresponsibly, pot smoking, not saving money and trashing our house. I don’t want to be insensitive but I don’t want anyone living in our basement. Final note is I’m a recovering alcoholic/addict and don’t want the alcohol or drugs around either. I don’t feel tempted but just don’t want it here. Also feel it would be healthy for him to show a little independence. So, AITAH?",1,1764396977.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

1p9hd5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p9hd5s/married_to_a_woman_who_loves_everyone_and/,"Married to a woman who loves everyone and everything, but I feel less loved and disrespected.","How does one deal with Disrespect in a relationship? And who can actually define disrespect in a relation? Is it when someone FEELS that is called disrespect? Or is it a 3rd person who can truly differentiate disrespect with playfulness or something else.



For context this is my 2nd marriage and I have been in a few relationships before this. My first marriage left me traumatized as the girl was more of a con-artist who would marry men and then few months later run away or put police cases on the men who would then get scared and give her huge sums of money for settlement. So obviously when I was still dating after my 1st divorce I was only involved with women who either didn't want anything long term or were the nurturing quiet and kind hearted people who would be with me respectfully (both sides) and create a life and family that grows together and stays happy together. 



Until I found one. Lets call her Pam. LIke Pam from The Office. Because that is who she reminded me off. simple, calm, patient and incredibly thoughtful and hard working. We dated for a couple of years. In the duration I found out she's close friends with my friends' wife so we hung out together. I also made her meet a few of my cousins. These social events were more of mock tests for me to see what everyone felt about her and how she felt dealing with them as I had a pretty decent social circle and a larger than normal family. Also, she comes from a broken family so it was important for me to see that large family gatherings didn't make her uneasy or distressed. 



Fast forward another year and we got married. Everyone in my family and friends group fell in love with Pam. My grand parents, my mother, my uncles, cousins - they got so used to talking to her they would forget I was also around! hehe. My life had come full circle. this is EXACTLY the kind of person I wanted. Until, until I don't know what happened. Pam just, would sometimes change. 



What was unusual about my and Pams relation and marriage was that I moved from my semi-conservative eastern european country to settle in her western country. This was she could stay near her ailing grandma while also not having to move her pets. Her family also used to live not very far from where we lived. This made me feel happy that I compromised/ scarificed so that Pam could thrive and be happy and care for her loved ones. Also, Pam is a VERY hard worker. Almost, too hard a worker. Multiple jobs. Cooking cleaning (which I took over now). Even with me, she'd go out of the way to get me things even when I tell her I DID NOT want it or that I was ok without it. It was impossible for me to catch up to her. May be, that was an issue. 



Because Pam was an overachiever and an ALWAYS present daughter, sibling, friend, granddaughter, employee, pet-parent, she'd often times prioritize those things above our relation. Which was fine by me. But in between those things, she'd even forget that I'm her husband and not a room mate. And same with her family, they started treating me like i'm just a younger cousin. Wherein I was taking more care of the house we shared, I was cooking all the meals for everyone (we used to eat together a lot), I was cleaning dishes, doing clothes, taking care of grandma whenever Pam was busy etc. But sometimes Pam would just look at me and talk to me and treat me like I'm nobody. 



I know I must be soundning like a horrible, entitled and insecure pig, but in all the love she was having and giving to everyone else, I feel like the love we have and should be sharing is getting lost. More than that, it's the respect. Or am I too old school? I mean for example she's been on the phone with her sister for over 1 hour and I called her three times so we could share our coffee together, but she came out furious as to why was I incapable of being quiet and patient while she was 'busy' on phone. Another time, she lost it at me and my mother when my mother sort-of-playfully-but-with-some-fear told her that she can't sit in a car being driven by Pam since Pam is sort of fast driver. Pam told her to take a cab with me next time she wants to go anywhere. My mom was embarassed and speechless. And it's not that we haven't had discussions or arguments or fights over this. And everytime, I am the one who is wrong according to her. 



I mean. May be I am the asshole? I haven't proofread this, haven't made corrections, no revisions. So, Just tell me like it is. ",1,1764396067.0,AITAH,5,0.67,False

Last September, my (23F) boyfriend (27M) and I had an argument about his classmate — a super entitled, mayabang na bakla — who kept giving him review notes. In return, my boyfriend would buy him coffee as a “thank you.”

Nothing wrong with that… until this classmate kept posting on TikTok/IG implying na may gusto daw ang boyfriend ko sa kanya. Like publicly. Parang clout-chasing level.

I brought it up to my boyfriend because siyempre, uncomfortable ako. Instead of reassuring me, he snapped and said “grabe ka mag-isip,” and that buying coffee is just “basic human decency.” Fine. I tried to understand. I told myself maybe I was overthinking.

Fast forward to recently: my ate and her boyfriend came to our house para mameet siya ng buong family namin. After they left, I was telling my boyfriend about the usual things — how the meet-up went, etc.

Turns out—he actually knows my ate’s boyfriend. And suddenly he starts badmouthing him. Sabi pa niya he doesn’t want to be involved with him and “mag-sama na lang daw kami lahat-lahat.”

So ako, calmly, I threw his words back at him:
“Pakitaan mo lang ng basic human decency.”

And boom. BLOCKED. Everywhere. No explanation. No conversation. Just poof.

Honestly? Maybe he got scared of his own hypocrisy. Maybe ayaw niya ng mirror. Maybe “basic human decency” only applies when he’s the one receiving it.

Right now I’m just sitting here like… what did I even do wrong except use his own logic?

That’s my reality. I’ve been doing this since I was a kid, I’m 32, and the only time I ever lost weight was during a period of extremely unhealthy behaviors I won’t repeat or endorse.

Now I’m stuck in the restrict–binge cycle: I restrict, binge, go to the gym for hours, then end up eating 5,000 calories anyway. I’ve “started again” more than 24 times this year. I know my high-stress job, school, and workouts make things harder, but it still feels impossible. I’ve tried everything — more protein and fiber, water, calorie counting, not counting, shame, self-love — nothing breaks the pattern.

It feels like everyone around me has their own coping mechanisms — weed, alcohol, hookups — and mine is eating huge amounts of food while watching TV. I’ve even tried avoiding screens, and it didn’t help.

I don’t want to go on GLP-1s; I can’t afford them, and I don’t want to rely on that path.

I’m a software dev (not HVAC) helping a buddy who runs a commercial shop. I watched his estimator spend 4 hours manually typing model numbers from a nasty 50-page scanned PDF asset list into Excel just so they could upload it to ServiceTitan.

It looked miserable. He was literally squinting at ""Trane YCD..."" on one screen and typing it into a spreadsheet on the other.

I spent the weekend building a tool to automate it for him, and I wanted to see if this is a problem for anyone else here or if he's just old school.

**What I built (currently running as a simple web app):**

1. **Drag & Drop:** You upload the messy PDF (scans, coffee stains, weird formatting).
2. **AI Cleanup:** It extracts the table, fixes typos (e.g., changes ""Carrrier"" to ""Carrier""), and splits the Make/Model/Serial into columns.
3. **The ""ServiceTitan"" Hack:** It auto-formats the CSV for import and stuffs the filter/belt info into the ""Memo"" field so the techs actually see it on the roof.

**My questions for you guys:**

1p9h473,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1p9h473/how_do_you_hang_out_casually/,How do you hang out casually?,"So the example here I'll use for the rest of the post is going to a coffeeshop but obviously hanging out also includes stuff like Ieating lunch with someone, doing a hobby, or really any kind of casual hangout (I don't have many good examples as I don't really have friends :3).

So obviously I don't actually know how hanging out is supposed to work. For the example of hanging out with a friend at a coffee shop I've done something similar before, the closest thing was I got bagels with someone at a local shop. I think we organized it over Snapchat, but it was really awkward (doesn't help that she was half my height). Anyway I don't know how people decide they're going to hang out. You either need to like know someone's schedule, plan it in advance, or ask someone when you see them which at college so far has been once, maybe twice a week in class or at a club meeting. Even then planning something like a were going to go to x place at x time is something I don't have the energy to do more than once a week.

Hanging out casually is obviously important as it feels hard to be actually friends with someone if you only see someone once a week and generally people talk as if once you get closer or have done something with someone or are starting to become friends you naturally start meeting and talking with them more but it's not really natural but a skill that I don't really have. The other connected thing here is texting but I can save that for later.


Anyway I was wondering what people do when they hang out, how they organize/decide/ask people to hang out and if anyone has any similar issues.",3,1764395245.0,socialskills,2,1.0,False

**Published:** October 2025  
**Source:** *OffTheFrontPage*  
[Read the full article](https://offthefrontpage.com/fox-news-forced-to-acknowledge-the-soaring-cost-of-living/)

Fox News has begun openly reporting what many households have been feeling for months: everyday costs in the United States are rising sharply. In a shift from earlier coverage that blamed inflation on previous administrations, several Fox News segments now concede that rising prices are happening **during Donald Trump’s current term** — and that their own polling reflects growing public frustration.

The report highlights increases in essential categories: coffee up nearly 20%, utilities rising more than 11%, auto-repair costs jumping over 11%, and electricity rising roughly 5%. The network, which once framed cost-of-living pressures as “left-wing economic mismanagement,” is now being forced to describe the problem in real terms because the numbers are too large — and too widely felt — to ignore.

> “Almost 60% of Americans now say Trump is responsible for higher grocery prices,” Fox’s own poll shows.

> “These are price spikes that hit every household — and they’re happening on Trump’s watch.”

The article argues that the political impact could be significant: if costs continue to climb, voters may reassess the promises of affordability and economic relief that fueled Trump’s return to office. With consumer frustration rising and Fox’s messaging shifting, the cost-of-living crisis is no longer an abstract policy debate — it’s becoming a central political liability.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Me(19M) and my now ex-girlfriend (19F) broke up last month. We were together from March-October of this year. During the relationship for some reason I would either feel incredibly distant or madly in love with her with no in-between. I was faithful but due to a promiscuous past, she was anxious to the point of being controlling and emotionally abusive. (Asked what I was up to nearly every time I'd leave my place, would overthink female friends I've had for years, I was NOT allowed to make more female friends) This anxious behavior started to push me away little but little even though I was fine reassuring her.

I wasn't the greatest to her I won't lie, I would shut down and not communicate when I was upset which is something I tried working on, I was insecure at times and it made me pull away. Me and her moved fast but we both felt so intense about each-other, with her telling me quote that this relationship feels deeper than her two-and-a-half year long relationship prior to me. I loved this girl more than anything and we both are aligned in our goals and wants in a relationship. In August, things got worse. Much worse.

I was put on Zoloft at the beginning of the month and immediately I noticed I was more irritable, and she noticed to. I got snappier and snarkier, I felt stressed around her always (it made my anxiety worse), and when the moments were good - I felt they wouldn't last.  
The irritability never went away until I weaned off of it. (more on this later)

I had a bad feeling in my gut and said we should take a few days apart in early October, we proceeded to, and I felt nothing, I missed her at times and other times I felt like there was a massive weight off my shoulder. We got back together and then later in October we broke up for good, I had made a female friend purely platonically, but i felt I needed to hide it so whenever she would text me in class I lowered my brightness, which definitely didn't look good. (I offered to show my ex all of our texts when we were breaking up) When she finalyl found out, I told her I wanted to introduce my ex to her, my ex immediately said that she'd try not to overthink it but upon finding out this girl followed me on instagram now, she told me we were done.

I tried to talk with her about it and she was firm in not wanting this anymore but simultaneously telling me very mixed signals, things like she still loves me but has to push it down so she can move on, that if she doesn't say she'll never get over me shes gonna be disappointed when she ends up crying in her bathroom again, that she's so in love with me but this can't be fixed because ""the switch flipped"", she said I always sigh when she makes jokes like I don't wanna be around her or that she's annoying even though I expressed MULTIPLE times that sigh is a playful sigh of ""oh my god that was so dumb I love you"". Now onto the final two parts - please bear with me.

We made our entire schedules together so we shared classes and sit right next to each-other in two of them, the morning one has no assigned seats but she always sat next to me and a few days after we broke up I noticed she didn't come to class. I didn't try to start a conversation as she expressed wanting no contact, so I just sent my notes from a place of kindness ""noticed you weren't in class - hope these help. You don't need to reply"" and it started a conversation - I couldn't help but reply. It turned into a 45 minute circular conversation of me going ""I know this is fixable if you would just talk to me, I know I can be better."" (I had just started therapy and weaning off of my Zoloft 3 days prior to our breakup) and her accusing me of trying to manipulate her back into being with me (I said multiple times I understand if she's being final but she contradicted herself about wanting me and not wanting me so I was left with mixed signals), until eventually it ended with her saying that she never wants to be with me and that we weren't good to each-other and she recognizes how she was emotionally abusive to me and vice versa. We went no contact and I didn't contact her or plan to. I texted a mutual friend of ours (Primarily her friend but someone who was friendly and expressed in the past they cared about me not just because I was a boyfriend of one of her friends.) and I sent a very respectful text about not wanting to start drama or gossip but that it would be nice to have a neutral or near ear to talk to the situation about in order to maybe help receive the closest thing to closure I can get, and if I was overstepping by texting I apologize.

This did not go over well with my ex. She proceeded to tell me if I had any unresolved questions or thoughts that I should have asked her, and I responded with ""you told me we were no contact, I was respecting that"" and I get hung up on. Fast forward to this week, I'm told by a person in their friend group that the night we broke up she said ""yeah we'll probably get back together in a week"", but a week after we broke up she says she hates me?? I don't get it. I weaned off of Zoloft completely and have started Wellbutrin and I feel like a completely new man, my road-rage is nearly gone, my emotional regulation is far better, I'm calmer, and It takes WAY more to get me irritated than before, like I can count the times I've been irritated in the past week with one hand when before, I was practically 24/7 annoyed, and I had no motivation to do anything. I think my depression manifested primarily in irritability and a lack of motivation, I've got back into my hobbies, I've been waking up early to go to the gym, I feel happier, and therapy is really helping. I just can't shake the feeling that if I started these things months ago - we'd have been okay, she told me she starts therapy in December. In class where we're required to sit next to one another she's cold and distant, refusing to even do required group-work.

I can't help but feel like given a few more months of therapy and medication stabilization, I can be exactly who I want to be, mostly for myself but also because it literally changed my side of our issues. I want to break no contact in the future but I don't know how or if that's even smart, I don't want to treat another person how I treated her and I also want enough self respect to want better for myself. From talking to my therapist I think we're both fearful-avoidant or she is a mix of fearful and anxious, I just want advice on what to do. I want to use this as a learning experience to become the best man I can (something I'll do regardless of the future). I just don't know if I should fully move on or still have hope for the future. Maybe I can shoot a text to see how she's doing in a couple months, ask her to coffee, or even just a hi? I don't know. I'm perfectly happy healing and growing by myself but I miss her and her dogs and hell even her parents, the good times showed that we had potential to add SO much more to each-others lives, our personalities were super compatible in most ways.

I'd really like some advice, I know this is long and wordy and I apologize. I'm young and I know that but It's nice to find your person early( I don't believe in soulmates - I believe in growing together and sticking through the hard times, that's who your person is imo) a part of me wants it to be her still so intensely even now, and the other part of me is saying we treated eachother terribly and to move on.

TLDR: I was extremely irritable, unmotivated, and snappy for half of my relationship due to severe untreated Major Depressive Disorder and lack a of therapy. shortly before the breakup I started therapy to try and heal my issues, I started Wellbutrin as well and I already feel like a completely new man in almost every way, going from barely able to find the effort to do homework to now hiking and working out nearly every day and I want to decide if and when reconnecting with her is a good idea.

I am a whistleblower recently ""retired"" from the inside. And you're only getting part of the truth.

Hi. So I heard y'all want disclosure? Alright, hope you have time for this because there's a LOT. Grab a coffee or maybe get comfy with a pillow somewhere.

I've been watching the news and hearing a lot of things I know to be true shockingly being talked about openly by some higher ups in a documentary so I figured what the hell?

You can call me Rhea. Not my real name obviously, but it will do. 

A little about me... I spent about eight years in the military to pay for college and then another decade plus in a part of the US intelligence component that does not officially exist. On paper I worked for a boring sounding office in a department most people have never heard of. In reality it was a compartment inside a compartment where the odd stuff of a certain nature got routed.

My actual specialty is electro-optics. Lasers, sensors, EO imaging systems, the math and hardware behind how we detect things at a distance and, in some cases, put energy on them. That is what I trained in, what I did most of my serious work on once I was off the deployment treadmill. So when I say I know something about directed energy weapons and weird sensor returns, that's not ""I heard this from a friend of a friend"". That was my day job. Most of my career was boring in the way dangerous jobs are boring. Long days in windowless rooms. Iraq and Afghanistan in the early years, doing the usual mix of SIGINT and HUMINT support. Phone records, pattern-of-life workups, building target packets on people who’d never know my name but might notice a drone overhead later. After I got out of uniform I slid over to contractor work, then got pulled into the permanent government side.

For a long time my world was very normal: counterterrorism, sanctions evasion, shady cargo going through weird ports, stuff like that. After that, foreign missile tests and what you have probably seen described publicly as space domain awareness. Basically, watching dots move around the sky and trying to decide whose dots they were and what they were doing.

The weird part started when I was detailed to a small interagency working group looking at what was called ""anomalous aerospace and undersea systems"". Translation: things detected and showing up on sensors that did not match any known platform, did not behave like clutter, and did not go away when you changed radar modes or swapped optical systems. I was there because I understood both sides of the equation: the physics of the sensors and the intelligence context. You get taught very quickly to treat anything unexplained as a glitch, a calibration issue, operator error, software artifacts, anything that keeps your world tidy. You get used to hearing “weird glitch” as a catch-all. Except after a while you notice some of those “glitches” kept showing up, across different systems, different countries, decades apart. Same behaviors. Same basic locations. Same signature that never quite fits. At some point you either admit there is a real pattern or you drive yourself crazy trying not to see it. If you are useful and you start asking the wrong questions for long enough, someone eventually pulls you aside, takes you to a SCIF, takes your phone, has you sign your life away again, and shows you the next layer of the onion. 

This onion goes so deep I doubt that even after years of briefings I've been exposed to anything below a few layers. Even still most of this is purposely kept off NIPR and JWICS and is done in person.

That is where I learned about most of what you're interested in here and what seems to be bubbling to the surface in the news lately. That when I learned about what we call The Council. Yes aliens, and I suspect you're not likely to see a lot of what I know mentioned even by some who know it who have begun speaking out for reasons I'll get into later. 

I've never met them face to face. Everything I know about them is from briefings, documents, and one secure video session that I honestly wish I had skipped. But it lines up with too many independent data points to just shrug off as somebody’s pet theory.

The basic story is this. Earth was noticed roughly 2 billion years ago, long before anything walked around on land. Not because we’re special, but because we tripped a sensor. Or rather life tripped their sensors. You see, The Council is not a single species. It is a collective of several advanced interstellar maybe even interdimensional civilizations that run long term surveys of stars and planets the way we run spy satellites. Huge distributed arrays of instruments, working together, watching thousands of star systems at once, for millions of years at a time. Their gear probably makes the James Webb telescope look like a kid's backyard telescope.

About 2 billion years ago those instruments picked up biosignatures here, chemical fingerprints in the atmosphere that meant something was alive here. Atmospheric composition like free oxygen and methane, spectral fingerprints, chemical disequilibria that scream “there’s metabolism happening down there!"" you know, the basics. At that point Earth went into a database as “interesting, revisit later”.

Standard procedure for them when a world looks promising is pretty boring from their point of view. They send automated probes. Not big crewed ships like you see in sci-fi movies, just small, tough, very smart machines. Those probes come in, mostly target the oceans, and set up self replicating facilities on the seafloor. Those facilities use local materials to build more facilities, more probes, craft that can operate underwater, in the air, in near space, and eventually avatars that can interact with whatever life evolves. These biological or rather, biomechanical avatars are what some people who claim to have been abducted have likely experienced.  Though they do have what we would call ASI, these beings are not gods, they are technology and they aren't perfect, they make mistakes, glitch out, etc. 

The reason they base all of that underwater for a simple reason. The bottom of an ocean does not care about ice ages, political empires, climate swings or wars. Temperatures and pressures change slowly over what long periods of time. Its a fairly stable environment and for much of human history has been mostly inacessible. Speaking of time, we Earth humans tend to think in terms of nothing longer than the current human lifespan. And when pondering non-human intelligence we like to think in terms of deep space, distance and light years but we seldom consider the lifespan and concept of time for a post-biological species could be quite different than outs. Only our most astute thinkers in the realms of geology, palentology and cosmology think in terms of millions or billions of years. Geologic epochs, cosmological history. That is childsplay for The Council which has a different concept of time, more concerned with deep time, millions of years at a stretch. As such their infrastructure is designed for that. 

So yes, a lot of the TMOs (transmedium objects) and impossible accelerations you have heard about are just their hardware doing its job. Maintenance, observation, sampling. Nothing heroic. The warp bubble/Alcubierre effect was probably mastered by them before our solar system even existed. It's old tech for them. Kinda like the wheel is for us. Also, no, we are not the center of anyone’s universe. There are about a billion planets in our galaxy that are more or less like Earth. Some just have microbes. Some have more complex life. A smaller subset of those have or once had civilizations. We are just one more entry, a fairly recent one in cosmological terms, in a very large survey.

Once early humans started doing interesting things, we moved from “planet with life” to “planet with potential”. They have watched this same story unfold in slightly different ways around a thousand times from what I understand. Chemistry leads to biology, biology creates technology. Tool use, language, agriculture, cities, industry, energy, space travel. Somewhere in there you always hit the same fork. Either the species figures out how not to blow itself to pieces with the energy densities it increasingly has access to such as nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, anti-matter and more exotic matter/energy, or it wipes itself out.

Our situation worried them. We are a little paradox: extremely good at cooperation and also extremely good at organized violence. Our aggression stood out. Cooperation plus violence isn’t unique, but we’re very, very good at both. And once you get to things like nuclear power, that combo tends to end very badly. They'd seen plenty of variations of that play out over at least a few billion years.

About 10,000 years ago our trajectory towards that became clear and there was a major argument inside the Council about what, if anything, to do with us. One side said the odds favored self destruction once we discovered and weaponized atomic level technologies. The other side argued we were worth saving or at least worth understanding better. The compromise was an experiment. One which has ramifications as to why all of this has been hidden for so long.

Roughly 65,000 humans were removed from Earth and relocated to what is basically a preserve on a planet around the star you know as 82 Eridani. Internally we called those people Erids. That star is in our catalogs if you feel like looking it up, but the details of the target planet are not public for obvious reasons.

The Erids were started in a kind of controlled paradise. Their world has large dispenser systems that can produce whatever basic material needs they have. Food, clothing, tools, building materials, entire strucures for habitation. Think Star Trek replicators scaled up and wired into the environment. In that setup nobody starves, nobody is homeless in the way we understand it, nobody spends their life chasing money just to meet needs. This was just the Erids natural reality.

The point from The Council's view was to remove material scarcity from the equation and see what humans do and achieve when they are not spending most of their energy bashing each other over the head over resources. Meanwhile, the rest of us stayed here on the control planet, dealing with scarcity, ownership, money, hoarding, and the rise of socio-political systems based on scarcity: all of the things that define Earth civilization.

The result, according to what we were briefed, is that the Erids are now around 5,000 years ahead of us technologically, averaged out. Same species, same basic biology, same starting point, completely different trajectory because of conditions. Nature vs nurture on a cosmic scale. For most of their history they Erids thought they were native to that world. They only found out the truth roughly a century ago in our time. They learned that they were uplifted, that their ancestors were taken from Earth, that they have cousins here.

Once they knew that, some of them started coming back to visit the original branch. This is where their history intersects the some of the UFO stories you know. The “aliens” that look almost exactly human are just that. Human. They are not hybrids, not clones, not secretly angels or demons. They are Erids, born around another star, showing up here after being given a 10,000 year head start. They have in some cases met with leaders of certain countries and at least two U.N. Secretary Generals (both deceased).

Now we get to why this has been buried for 80 some years.

You have to think like a senior US official in the 1940s and 1950s. World War II has just ended, the Cold War is starting, everything is viewed through capitalism versus communism. Then someone puts a briefing in front of you that says, in essence, there is a group of humans living on another world who have no money, no private ownership in the way we structure it, automatic systems that meet their basic needs, and in that environment they advanced thousands of years faster than we have. The men who built what we now call the legacy program in the US that sounded less like “interesting anthropological data” and more like “a walking, talking advertisement for space communism.” It looked like proof that communism works better than the system they were trying to defend. That and the ramifications of what could happen if THAT ever got out terrified them more than the existence of aliens did, though to be fair they plenty had their worldview rocked by the latter too.

So the core of the cover up has never just been “aliens” or even their technologies. It has been the systemic implications. The idea that scarcity and ownership are not hard coded into reality, that they are one possible way to run a society, and maybe not the optimal one. That was seen as an existential political threat in the 1940s and 1950s and some of the people who grew up in that mindset are still steering parts of the program today. 

Now add in the famous crash-retrieval incidents. Roswell '47, Kecksburg '65, a handful of other retrievals around the U.S. and around the world. What we were told is that most of those were not accidents. They were tests and gifts. The Council, with Erid input, allowed certain craft and systems to fall into human hands in a controlled way. Enough intact technology that a very motivated and capable society could learn from it, not enough that it would instantly rewrite everything.

 In fact the Kecksburg landing, it wasn't called a crash internally, was a direct result of a meeting and gift agreement made at Holloman AFB the year prior. The idea was to see who did what with it. Who could figure it out, who kept it secret, who tried to share, who tried to weaponize it, who panicked. Based on those results, the plan was to pick one primary human partner to act as the main interface for full Council contact and to begin a managed process of reunifying Earth humans with the Erids and introducing us to the wider community.

You can argue whether that is a good way to do it. I am just telling you that is the framework I saw laid out.

In the 1980s-90s during a brief period when the Cold War ended there was a push to finally disclose much of this. This was initially proposed at meeting between then U.S. President Ronald Reagan and then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev at a summit in Reykjavik, Iceland in 1986. Also discussed was getting rid of nuclear weapons as had been urged by The Council. In the end it was decided to wait. There were two more U.S. pushes for disclosure between then and the 2017 New York Times article. One during the Clinton administration and another during the transition between the Obama and first Trump presidency.

Now for the part that put a clock on all of this stuff you've been hearing about 2027 etc....

About three years ago, a species that is hostile to the Council found out about the Earth project. They are not part of the collective. They resent the way the Council handles in younger civilizations as they themselves felt victimized by the Council. They also resent the credit the Council gets for “successful” cases. I have heard them described as the jealous neighbors who would rather break your toys than watch you win. 

Yes, we sometimes joke about this stuff because again, it's the only way to stay sane with this everyday knowledge and integrate it into your civilian life of thanksgiving dinner, xmas shopping, taking the kids to soccer practice etc.  Just as an aside, ever consider how two of the biggest holidays of they year involve gluttony (Thanksgiving) and overconsumption (Black Friday)? When you have the knowledge many have within the program stuff that is taken for granted seems really weird and a symptom of the now, forced scarcity of our current system.

Anyway back to the aliens... The hostile group I mentioned decided to spoil the experiment.

This species is ahead of us technologically but far behind the Council. Though they also inhabit a relatively nearby star cosmologically speaking, their travel is slower, less elegant and has to take place in stages, think of it as space ""island hopping"" which is why the lead time is so long. You probably want to know what they look like. Physically, based on the descriptions we saw, they are about five feet tall, segmented bodies, multiple limbs, basically ant like in overall form. Nothing subtle or humanoid about them.

They launched an expedition toward Earth with the stated goal of making a mess. Cause chaos here, damage the experiment, and embarrass the Council by showing they cannot protect their own projects due to internal disagreements. Basically exploiting internal fissures, turning small cracks of understanding in The Council into canyons, thus destroying it. That's their hope at least. The transit time means for us they are expected to arrive in roughly two years from now, the 2027 holiday present NO ONE asked for.

That news triggered a major debate within the Council. One group said, the rules say non interference, we watch and record what happens, even if it is ugly, as we had done in the past. The other group said, we effectively created this situation by tagging and monitoring this world, we have a moral obligation not to just watch a civilization we have been studying get smashed by somebody else’s grudge. If the Council showed up in force it would not be much of a fight. Their technology relative to the ant species is like a modern carrier group versus skilled archers on sailboats. The whole thing would be over quickly and it would also completely blow the point of letting a young species find its own way. It would also be a tremendous blow to the human ego which The Council is well aware of.

So they arrived at a compromise. No direct Council fleets defending Earth. No obvious intervention. Instead, they would quietly arm us.

What they chose to give us are things they roughly call scalar phase weapons. Our vocabulary is not great here. They are not just high power lasers. They interact with fields we do not fully understand or really have names for yet, shift phases, dump huge amounts of energy from the vacuum into very specific volumes of spacetime without a conventional bright beam or explosion. Compared to our current directed energy weapons, they are an enormous leap. As someone who spent years working with lasers and optics systems, I can tell you they sit so far off our current tech tree that if you saw the damage assessments from a pulse without context you would think they were misprints. But compared to Council weapons, they are nerf guns, training wheels per-se.

Anyway, that decision set off another big argument, both among them and among us. The obvious concern was simple. Once the external threat is gone, what stops us from turning these things on each other the same way we took nuclear power and turned it into thousands of warheads aimed at our own cities?

On the US side there were people saying exactly that. And some members of The Council argued that if we on Earth roll out scalar systems across arsenals, the first real test after the bugs are gone will likely be some crisis where two human governments start lighting each other up with technology they we do not fully understand.

The counter argument, which won, was that species level survival has to come first. If humanity gets wiped out by someone else’s petty feud, then the entire debate is academic. Also, if humans fight this off themselves instead of watching the Council show up and save the day, they will meet the wider community as people who actually did something, not as rescued primitives. Human ego intact. And kill switch if you will, has been built into the tech to disable it after the conflict which The Council sees us winning. If we then decide to use these weapons against each other they'll simply be disabled until we humans have learned enough to disable the kill-switch which could be thousands of years from now for all I know.

So against a lot of internal resistance, the Council has been quietly providing scalar phase systems to several blocs, not just the US. The list I saw included the United States, China, the European Union through specific channels, Russia, and Brazil. Those systems are being integrated into space platforms, aircraft, and undersea assets. Testing is happening in remote places and high altitudes, often disguised as other things. Most of the people physically working on it think it is an advanced homegrown black program. Only a very small circle in each capital sees the full context. I got to see pieces of that picture shortly before I was pushed into “retirement”, which is a polite way of saying I stopped being convenient. That is as specific as I am willing to get.

There is one more reason I am writing this now, after pondering it for a long time, and it is more personal than the two year clock.

A friend of mine, someone I worked closely with inside the program, another EO specialist, had been talking quietly years ago about going to Congress. Not with everything, they were not suicidal. Just enough to force a real closed door hearing in the Senate, get the true nature of certain SAPs acknowledged on paper, make it harder to bury the whole subject under jokes and career threats.

Over as year ago I got word that they died. The official explanation has been vague and unsatisfying. “Medical complications” on a trip to a black site in the Indian Ocean. Those medical complications do not match what I know about their health, then it became ""an accident at home” with no details anyone will put in writing. People who would normally be candid went very quiet very fast. Maybe it was just bad luck. People do die suddenly. But given the threats which are known about within certain IC sectors when one is associated with this subject, I don't know for sure. What I do know is that the last long conversation I had with them was about whether it was worth trying to talk to certain congressional staffers for a certain Senator.

After hearing recent news confirming publicly much of what I know to be true privately I stopped telling myself I would wait and see how things played out. Life is short.

So here we are. Some stranger on the internet telling you an unbelievable story you are free not to believe.

With roughly two years on the clock and the current rate of leaks and “whistleblowers” and half disclosures, it is very unlikely they keep all of this under wraps until the first time something openly not from here appears in our sky or our orbit. At some point before that happens, at least one major government, maybe more, is going to go public in a controlled way. My guess would be China or the US, but it could be one of the others on that scalar weapon list. You will likely get a very carefully worded announcement about unidentified aerial phenomena, about contact with “non human intelligences”, about new defensive technologies and unprecedented international cooperation. It will be designed to manage panic and control the story.

What you probably will not hear in the first round of briefings is the part about the Erids, the economic implications of their society's existence, the billion other habitable planets, the undersea infrastructure that has been here longer than we have had bones. You will not see anyone step up to a podium and say “oh by the way, there is a branch of humanity that grew up without the idea of money and scarcity ten thousand years ago and advanced five millennia past us”.

That is why I am dumping this here, where people can ignore it, laugh at it, or save it and see how it ages.

Like I said, do not have to believe me. I'm not here to sell a book, go on podcasts, be on Tv or do UFO lectures/ Treat this as fiction if that makes you more comfortable. What I am really trying to do is get you to think past the kiddie pool questions. “Are UFOs real” ""Are the NHI good or evil?"" is not the interesting part. The far more interesting questions are what happens to this planet once everyone knows we are being watched, that we have cousins around another star, that some of the basic assumptions we built our societies around were just one option, not a fundamental law of nature.

If in a year or two you start hearing officials talk about “our cousins among the stars” or “civilizations far older than ours” and “new non kinetic systems” and “shared planetary defense”, remember this post and see how well it fits. Look, the bugs are coming either way. The Council is not going to save us directly. They already handed out the tools and they are watching to see what we do with them.

The part that is still up to us is what kind of world we build if we get through it. Will we all go back to work and beat each other over the head with really advanced sticks or do we achieve a more enlightened potential?

That is all I have.

1p9gn6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Irrigation/comments/1p9gn6d/i_built_a_free_tool_as_a_hobby_project_to/,I built a free tool as a hobby project to visualize Orbit/Flume irrigation data over time (looking for feedback),"Long-time lurker, first-time poster.  I’m a homeowner (in California) with a number of Orbit B-hyve wifi controllers that are integrated with a Flume monitoring device (which measures water usage at the meter by the street).  I wanted a simple way to see water usage over time on a per-controller and per-valve basis.  Basically, I wanted tools to easily spot leaks and/or weird behavior across all of the controllers and valves. The stock apps from Orbit and Flume are fine for what they do but they aren’t great for plots and charts like this.  So I hacked together my own tool to collect the data from Orbit and to show different types of plots.  I then cleaned it up enough that others could use it and deployed it as a hosted service.

It's now live at[ https://hydrolytics.ai/](https://hydrolytics.ai/)  It's free to use. Individuals can create their own account, link it to their Orbit accounts and see plots of all of their irrigation data.  It works best on desktop but it’s mobile responsive.  Anybody can sign up. There's a ""buy me a coffee"" button if you're feeling generous, but absolutely no pressure — this is a hobby project for me, not a business. I'm posting here because I'd genuinely love feedback.  Specifically:

* What features would actually be useful to you?
* What's confusing or could be better?
* Is this solving a problem you have, or am I the only nerd who wants water usage graphs?

Happy to answer questions. And if you try it out, let me know what you think!

Note that to get **any** use out of the tool, you have to have:

1. One or more Orbit B-hyve wifi controllers (and an Orbit account)
2. A Flume water monitoring device that’s on your meter by the street
3. You have to have integrated the Flume data into your Orbit account already

If you have all of those working then once you create an account on my site, you can provide it with your orbit credentials and the site will grab your watering data and show you plots and stuff. And it will periodically re-grab your irrigation data.

If this type of post isn’t allowed here, mods please delete and I’ll happily take it down. Otherwise I’d really appreciate any feedback, including “this is dumb, here’s why.”

1p9g9a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1p9g9a8/cold_emailing_vps_and_directors_in_finance_for/,Cold Emailing VPs and Directors in Finance For Co-op,"What have people's experiences been with cold emailing VPs or Directors, specifically within finance at major banks, and attaching a resume or cover letter for a role you've already applied to online?

If you are, or have been, in a VP/Director-level position, how do you typically feel when you receive these types of emails?

I've been doing a lot of networking recently, mostly through Linkedin and coffee chats, but I'm considering taking the extra step and cold emailing a few alumni from my school who currently work at the banks I'm applying to. I've seen very mixed opinions on this, some people say it demonstrates initiative and shows you're outgoing, while others argue that it's a bad idea and could even hurt your chances or put you on an informal blacklist for future roles.

Given all of this, I'm wondering whether cold emailing is worth trying or if I should stick strictly to building connections through LinkedIn messages and coffee chats.",0,1764392451.0,jobs,1,0.5,False
1p9g8pg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1p9g8pg/difficult_extended_family_member/,Difficult extended family member,"I’m dealing with a bit of a dilemma and would really appreciate some advice. I’m a millennial based in Melbourne, but I travel to Sydney a few times a year for work events. I also have a first cousin there who is a fair bit older than me (Gen X, late 50s).



We’ve never had much in common, and I often struggle to find things to talk about with her. She still treats me like the child she remembers rather than the adult I am, with my own life and views. She’s genuinely kind and generous, and she often sends gifts for me and my kids — but they’re usually not things we use or wear, and I feel guilty that they often end up being donated.



Recently, I went to Sydney for a two-day work event and let her know out of courtesy. I suggested a quick coffee, but she insisted on a long dinner. She ended up arriving very late, brought along a man I wasn’t expecting, and chose a restaurant far from my hotel. The whole evening ran much longer than I’d planned, and I ended up exhausted for my work event the next day.



Despite telling her I only had a backpack, she also gave me a pile of clothes to take home, which made travelling back a hassle. She then insisted that next time I stay with her for a day or two so she can cook for me — which isn’t something I’m comfortable with for a variety of reasons.



To be transparent, part of my discomfort is that I don’t really connect with the people she spends time with, including her partner. Our lifestyles, values, and priorities are extremely different, and I find myself feeling uneasy in those environments. I’m also aware I have some internal biases about the choices she’s made and the circumstances she lives in — and I’m trying to acknowledge that honestly without letting it turn into judgement or cruelty.



Here’s where I’m stuck:

I want to be respectful, but I also want to use my limited Sydney time to see people I genuinely connect with. However, these people are also connected to us through family, so I can’t simply hide my visits.



How do I set boundaries with my cousin without hurting her feelings or creating unnecessary drama?



Is there a polite way to limit the intensity or frequency of contact while still being kind? Am I overthinking this, or being too “class-conscious”? I’d really appreciate some guidance on how to approach this gracefully but firmly.",1,1764392409.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

i’ve tried different pods, assembling the latte in a different order, to no avail. still yucky.

I highly recommend doing NCLEX Bootcamp's 2 month plan and following the exact schedule they generate for you. It gives you a well-rounded plan for all the major topics and concepts the NCLEX tests you on. Try your best to do questions every single day and work your way up to doing 85 questions daily so that by the time you walk into the real exam, the number of questions doesn’t feel overwhelming. Bootcamp has some of the best rationales I’ve ever seen, so make sure you read every single one, even if you got the question right. Their videos explaining the answers are so helpful too. I also highly recommend doing all 50 of the Bootcamp case studies and watching the video explanations. They really prepare you for NGN style questions. If you don’t understand a concept, their cheat sheets break everything down in such a simple and easy to understand way. I also watched all the Bootcamp crash course videos and did the quizzes after, they are super short and very helpful to review concepts. 

For content review, I truly believe everyone studying for the NCLEX should start with Mark K’s 12 lectures. They’re completely free on Spotify and the notes are free online. I took notes as I listened and made Quizlets for each lecture so I could review them every week. If there’s only one thing you do for NCLEX prep, it should be listening to Mark K. I also watched the Klimek Review YouTube channel with Dr. Sharon—those videos helped so much, and they have content on pretty much everything. Their Top 50 NCLEX drugs playlist is amazing because there’s no way to know every drug, but those ones and the ones Mark K talks about will absolutely show up. I also watched the Beautiful Nursing 1 hour comprehensive review on YouTube, the 2 hour crash review by Your Nursing Space, and Simple Nursing videos with Nurse Mike. Nurse Mike explains things in such a simple and fun way, and even his music videos help you remember random things. There are so many helpful free resources online that you can find with a quick search, so you don’t need to spend a ton of money to learn content.

I also did the Archer Intense Prep Program with Shelley, which is definitely expensive, but it helped me a lot. They give you a 6 week intense study plan plus live two-hour lectures twice a week. You also get two-hour Zoom tutoring sessions twice a week where they go over high-yield topics, question strategies, and any questions you have. My tutor sent weekly feedback videos based on the practice tests I took, which helped me understand my weaknesses better. Even if you don’t get the intense program, at least get the question bank. Do readiness assessments as often as you can if not every single day—Archer says that getting four High or Very High scores in a row gives you a 98% chance of passing. I personally think readiness assessments are way better than CAT exams because they give you a broader range of questions and give you a better see at the likelihood of passing.

Something that helped me a lot was taking my practice tests at the same time my real test was scheduled. After taking readiness assessments, I would look at when I started missing more questions and think about whether that’s when I needed to take a break. It’s really important to see when your performance dips and take a short break, breathe, and then keep going. Also, don’t study in your room every day—you will get distracted or end up scrolling or laying in bed. Go to a coffee shop, the library, or somewhere else to stay focused. Wake up in the morning to study instead of saving it all for the evening. You won’t have enough time to take breaks and still get everything done. Make a schedule and stick to it. Figure out your weaknesses and really work on those areas.

Do not study all day, every day—you will burn out. You have to take care of your mental health or none of the studying will matter. Take breaks, take walks, go to the gym if you can, at least get some fresh air. Hang out with your friends and make time to do things you love, even something small like grabbing a coffee or watching an episode of your favorite show. Maintaining a positive attitude while studying is so important. Surround yourself with good people who make you happy. You do not need extra stress on top of this. Find at least one person you can lean on. It helped me so much to review topics with my nursing school friends. Sometimes we would FaceTime and teach each other concepts in simple ways. Having someone to hold you accountable helps a lot too. I used to send my boyfriend my readiness assessment scores so he could hold me accountable and because he was one od my support systems. Even when I failed, he was supportive and helped me find new resources. Reading Reddit posts from other people also helped me so much—you really don’t feel alone when you see that other people have struggled too.

On test day, do not feel discouraged if you keep getting questions past 85. That doesn’t mean you’re failing—it means you’re still in the game and hovering near the passing line. Stay calm and don’t rush. Read each question slowly and carefully. There were so many times I got practice questions wrong just because I misread the question. Take your time. You have 5 hours for the whole exam, and you absolutely do not need to rush through it.

Lastly, I want to share this Google Drive link full of great free study materials, including the Mark K notes. They really helped me: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dda43n-ob6eNeyOxUWLAlH\_e78smQ1He?usp=share\_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dda43n-ob6eNeyOxUWLAlH_e78smQ1He?usp=share_link)

Overall, be consistent, take care of your mental health, use high yield resources, protect your confidence, and don’t study yourself into the ground. Being a repeat test taker is hard, but it doesn’t mean you can’t pass. Changing the way I studied made all the difference, and I hope my experience helps someone else.

She’s a single parent and she has done a really good job, but there has been this one consistent trend that I don’t know how to address she has stolen every dollar I’ve ever made when I got my first job. She opened up an account for me I and both of us had access to it. I worked for about eight months. Don’t remember how much I made but if I had to guess it was around $1500 and I maybe spent 700 of it so I had quite a bit left over one day I decided that I wanted to go to the mall and spend some I asked for my card and she said no, confused I asked why? she said there’s nothing on it again asked why there’s nothing on it and she said she took it all and spent it all I said on what she said on things that we need and pretty much dodged the question I let it go because I don’t like to  hold grudges and every time I try to confront her about it, she cried and made me feel like I’m the bad guy. For some context. She has diagnosed mental health issues that are all trauma related, fast forward to a month or two ago I did some work for my aunt and she paid me $50-$60 not too much longer after that I went to my grandparents 50th anniversary and my uncle who I have a very strong connection to that doesn’t live near here gave me $200 in cash that combined gave me a roughly 250 something dollars in cash. I hid it in my in my 10 Pokémon card holder. I hid it in my closet and I left it for a weeks I left it there cause I don’t want to spend my money that often and one day I decided that I wanted to buy something. I think it might’ve been a kayak for fishing and I went to go grab the money and it was gone I asked my mom what happened to it and we did the same song and dance that we did once prior. I decided to question her a little more this time I asked her did you spend this on rent for example like would we be homeless if you didn’t spend this, she stumbled and paused and stumbled before saying no we would’ve been fine so then I grilled her with further questions like what did you spend it on eventually she broke down and said she spent it on coffee and chocolate now after me trying to address this with her and her promising to pay me back it hasn’t happened yet and every time I try to remind her of it, she cries it makes it very hard for me to feel any kind of resolution to this. I don’t know why but recently these feelings have been coming up again since money has been getting tighter, I look at all my friends who have brand new things and I and I think to myself that I could have those nice things as well. If all the money I worked for wasn’t stolen in total she probably owes me up to $700. This whole ordeal has really killed any motivation for me to get another job since I believe any money that I make whether it’s in my account or in person would just be stolen. anyways Reddit .

I gave him the cake, and after that he said, “By the way babe, I’m going to have dinner with my friend.” I was like, “Ah okay.” He didn’t invite me at all — I was honestly so surprised.

Last night he also invited his friends and he didn’t insist on having me there. The other night, we went out for his advance birthday dinner but he said he left his wallet, so I ended up paying for everything.

I’ve been giving him gifts since the start of November, but I didn’t even get an invite today. When he realized it, he said he could buy me a coffee — it was a free Starbucks birthday drink.

The whole time, I was literally floating, feeling nothing. He kept insisting I could join the dinner, but I said no because it was just an afterthought. Later he admitted that he didn’t invite me because his friend gets awkward with girls around.

specs: 1:17 ratio (20:340), 95C water temp, zp6 on setting 6.2, ceramic v60 02, cafec abaca filters

- 60g bloom
- 60g pour (second bloom)
- 220g final pour
- gentle swirl to settle bed, promote agitation

pretty straightforward. i normally use 93C, but this coffee benefits from a slightly higher extraction and lighter body, so i up the temp instead of grinding finer.

We clicked, the first date was 1.5 hrs, including a walk and coffee ($14, I paid). We texted, called, and spoke many times. Then the next day, we met again, this time I visited her suburb on my way home. I took her to dinner. Total time was 1.5hrs plus. By the way, we kissed after both dates. Cost $65. I paid. Third date, she came to my house. She wanted my full name. I gave it. I also gave her my professional registration. So now she knew my name, my address and my work industry, also my workplace. Also during that date we engaged in kissing and slightly more (touching outside clothing).

Fourth date, she said, you can come over here. She sent photos of her lounge. I asked, would I be able to park at yours? Yes sure.

The next day (this would be our 4th date) the morning of my visit, I messaged, would you mind sending your address?

Then I got this response: ""Sorry. I am not comfortable giving out my address. We would need to date for a month for that to happen. You can come to my suburb"".

I feel betrayed by this.

1. She'd agreed I would visit.
2. It's not dangerous. She has my ID, my name, my address. She can call a friend and tell them I am coming.
3. Because I have been transparent and given her my details, I feel it is very odd for her not to reciprocate. I have not asked for her name, her work details, anything. I only needed the address to visit.

I feel this is a sign of someone who has such poor judgment or is so indecisive that I don't want to be involved. I also feel it is very unequal.

I messaged and said ""Don't worry. And to be honest, if you are now suddenly unwilling to give out your address, it just makes me think you are hiding something"".

I actually kind of hate dating over 40. Experiences like this just make me want to buy a dog, shut the door on the whole process.

She was wearing underwear and an oversized T-shirt with a picture of a cat and the words ""what kind of girl do you think I am?"". It made me so sad... I saw her old self-harm scars on her thighs. 

I had medical students with me. One laughed when I read aloud what was written on the T-shirt. I ask him ""What's so fucking funny?"". Nobody talked much after that... they just watched.

1p9fv8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/absentgrandparents/comments/1p9fv8s/sometimes_it_makes_me_sad/,Sometimes it makes me sad,"Our family is so small. My husbands parents died young. My family is very patchwork, chaotic and distant. We do meet up for birthdays and holidays, but that's pretty much it.

Parts of my childhood were bad, but I've ""forgiven"" my parents for most things, as they just didnt know better and had difficult upbringings themselves. I was never abused. We had a roof above our heads and a fridge full of food. What I didnt have was emotionally involved parents, who'd eat lunch *with me*, chat with me, help with my homework. Go on trips/ do activities with me. Parents who'd ask me how my day was. 

Instead, they were busy arguing. Busy with their own problems. They were probably happy that I became online-addicted and spent my teens glued to the computer, not bothering them. But there's definitely some resentment now.

My son is only (almost) 2, so I don't want to act like a ""know-it-all"", but at this point, I don't understand how you could ever become this detached and uninterested in your own child.

If you've come this far, you can probably guess that they're absent grandparents. They acted excited during my pregnancy and visited with many gifts at the hospital after birth. But that excitement soon died down. They now come over when we invite them (we live a 40 minute drive from each other), but then they just want to eat cake(my mom is obsessed with having cake when we meet),drink coffee, bitch about life and occasionally throw a ball back at their grandson who's desperately fighting for attention😐 last time I asked if we could go out for a walk, because babyboy was going crazy. They replied ""nah we're feeling kinda sluggish today"".
...

Before my last birthday, my mom asked me what I wanted and I said ""I'd love an afternoon off tbh!"" and we planned a date where she'd babysit our son. That eventually didnt happen because one of us became sick and then she never brought up the topic again. I know I could have, but at this point, I kinda gave up on making an effort. She likes to drop phrases like ""I'll play with him when he can actually play games"" as if there wasn't a whole load of stuff to play with him right now. At our last meeting, our son asked for someone to read a book. I forced a book into my moms hand lol and my son immediately climbed on her lap. They started reading it and it was very sweet, I went into the kitchen and started cleaning a little. 3 minutes in, he asked ""mama?"", probably just because he was curious about the noise I was making. And my mom RUNS with that and tells him ""Yeah where's mama? Go look what mamas doing and help her!"". I was disappointeeeeeed.
AND THEN LATER SHE TEXTED ME HOW MUCH SHE LOVED THEIR BOOKREADING MOMENT???? 
Okay, then why didn't you even TRY to make it last more than 3 minutes?
One time we went to the zoo. It was her idea and I really appreciated it. Babyboy ended up not being very interested in the animals and just enjoyed picking up random sticks and jumping around instead. Instead of acknowledging that, my mom kept dragging him to see the tigers etc and got disappointed when he wasn't super excited about them (as a 1,5 years old....).
Then not even 2 hours in she was like ""sorry, I have some handyman coming in for a repair soon, I need to go home now"" after I drove there 40 minutes??? Like, couldn't she tell me before or plan that for another day?

I've read somewhere that grandparents have a right to choose what kind of GP they wanna be. Some want to enjoy their retirement instead. Some are just not kids people (which I think is the case for mine). They often appear genuinely confused at what/why/how they should play with a toddler. Some grandparents want to be the ones that spoil the grandkids with sweets and gifts on special occasions only and thats it. I grew to accept it.

Oh and if anyone wonders why I seem to be cutting my dad some slack. He's not my biological father and I quickly realised the bond to his (non-biological) grandson isn't as strong. It's sad but just reality. He's also still working full-time and I kinda gave up on having hopes for him more quickly than for my mom.

I have PTSD especially from emergency service providers, how do I get him to stop.","He's in a wheel chair, I asked one of his support workers to address this, he hasn't listened. 

The knocking effects my PTSD, I don't like anyone knocking on my door loudly. It triggers me.

I'm about to go out, but that's an ineffective solution.

I even talked to the SIL provider about this yesterday, they are very bad sometimes about passing things on.

How do I deal with this other than asking to move houses?

I can do all the informal supports in the world, but low/non-verbal is actually really difficult and it fries my brain as a person with PTSD whose trauma history includes being misunderstood and not being heard.

I did it last night and then I had to say to myself ""I can't cope."" It takes a lot of detective work in getting to what they're saying, which causes a trauma response from me where my brain goes into overload and I get shutdown symptoms with amygdala hijacking.

It causes me to go into fight, flight, freeze, fawn, and at the moment avoidance which is a freeze symptom due to the prolonged knocking. This includes spending prolonged time here on Reddit to avoid having to tip toe past his door which is a reaction to when my father and brother abused me for just existing as a human being.

Every few hours he starts knocking on my door. I'm not a formal support, I'm not even an informal support. I tried calling the ambulance service and even police for a welfare check they're both avoiding their social responsibility to find the appropriate formal or informal support for him even though IT IS IN THE JOB DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THEY DO.

The police won't do anything because they think ""he can knock on the door at least."" The ambulance service hasn't arrived even though they would be qualified for non-verbals, just even to work out WTAF this person wants.

I don't like using the police for that purpose, and they're over stretched, and don't understand disability but it is within the charter of what they are set out to do in our society, yet they're flat out refusing.

He IS NOT and WILL NOT be my responsibility. I just can't deal with verbal conditions because of my PTSD, it triggers me even if I would otherwise help.

There are no after hours contacts for the SIL provider which is not only stupid but dangerous.

I'm going nuts, and my only solution to that is to take myself to a crisis support space. 

I believe he is low verbal, plus intellectual impairment of some sort and is in a wheel chair. He can ""self care"" and get in and out of bed so it's not that, he even has a phone, so it's not that either. He can use his phone, I even set it up for the internet last night, he can press buttons and work out what the password is because it's already in his phone now. He knows what he is doing enough to be lucid, so I don't know WTAF he wants from me.

It's almost like he's assuming, like some (not all) II people, that he's ""lonely"" and I am his after hours care. 

I am not and will not subject myself to after the trauma of living in a house with someone with an II when I could manage my PTSD better. I was abused coercivly by someone with an II who said they just wanted a housemate and then had very messy boundaries and that also affects me. 

In another sub, I even escaped by writing an entire journal entry (basically) about PTSD and management.

I can't deal... low/non-verbals trigger me because it reaches the point of ""information overload"" when I can't work out WTAF they want even if I am trying to be nice to people. IIs trigger me because of messy boundaries that they can have. I spent 6 months living in absolute hell with no boundaries because I couldn't find an appropriate break lease for the situation and will not subject myself to someone with messy personal boundaries like I am their family member or carer, or even ""friend."" The last time this happened it was coffee grinder on at 6am, ""lets go to Hillsong!"" followed by me saying ""NO!"" the person leaving their clothes wherever, expecting me to watch new age fundamentalist religious bullshit, and expecting me to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner with him then be his informal ""wing man"" when he went out to Coles and was sexually promiscuous and inappropriate with women while using his II as an excuse even when he knew better, even if he had lowered impulse control and lower sexual inhibition (that's not an excuse when he knows what sexual contact is).

1p9ftu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tryingtoconceive/comments/1p9ftu1/preworkout_while_ttc/,Preworkout while TTC,"I’ve posted before about the restrictive advice my partner and I received on our TTC journey. I’m 30 and we have been TTC for 24 cycles now. We were told only one shot of coffee a day, no soft drink whatsoever and no sparkling water with flavouring. This also includes no preworkout. All of which we have cut out the past 3-4 months. 

I have really struggled to show up and push myself at the gym without my preworkout. I’ve tried cleaner/more natural alternatives but they aren’t the same. My preworkout was a part of my routine that helped me step into my gym girl identity. It was also a fun drink reward for getting myself out the door to go. Since stopping, my gym routine has flopped. 

I’m keen to hear people’s thoughts on if the benefits of weight training 3 times a week would outweigh the negatives of a pre-workout 3 times a week? 

I have already been TTC for so long and tried so much, I kinda miss feeling like myself. I would absolutely not drink it while pregnant.  
I have short cycles, low AMH and low progesterone. I’ve just completed my first medicated cycle with letrozole and progesterone, which lengthened my cycle and improved my hormones.

1p9fnbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/onepagerpgs/comments/1p9fnbq/system_a_suburban_apocalypse_30_games_in_30_days/,System: A Suburban Apocalypse | 30 Games in 30 Days Challenge | Day 27,"**The Game**



A floating blue holographic screen that appears when you say “status.” Monsters that spawn in your neighborhood. Electronics have suddenly stopped working, and your neighbor Frank is carrying around a sword the size of a door. It appears reality has been replaced with some sort of System, and it is leading to some sort of Apocalypse. 

**What I Like About This One**

The idea of a ‘system apocalypse’ is intriguing to me. It suggests that, given an alternative set of values (survival, understanding of gaming tropes), different people would end up being particularly successful. It skirts objectivism in much the same way that superhero stories do. But it’s also just kinda fun to think about - what if reality was suddenly governed by Final Fantasy rules? What if the world was suddenly a reality tv show run by aliens and the challenges often resulted in mass murder? What if there was a weekly competition where you could fight to get your resources instead of having to go to a job you hate and do work for people you barely tolerate? 

**What I’d Do Differently Next Time**

This idea really, really wants to be a much bigger game. Like, a 4E style powers-based game or a PbtA game or something. It wants cronch so goddamn bad. Out of all the games I’ve made this month, this is the best candidate for expanding into standard publication size.

1p9flyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamblingRecovery/comments/1p9flyf/financial_improvement_postgambling/,Financial improvement post-gambling,"I’m officially one month gambling free today. I had quit initially on July 7th and went 3 months without gambling, relapsed, and quit again on October 28th. I feel really really good about where I’m at now. 

But the reason I’m posting here is: I think gambling may have had a silver lining. When I was gambling I did everything I possibly could to save money to gamble. Buying the bare minimum of food, stopped buying things like coffee, skincare products, etc. It sort of taught me how to save money in a weird way. I’ve started to transfer SOME of those methods post gambling, and now I think there’s a chance this was a really good lesson to take away from this whole thing. I feel like I’m more financially responsible now than I was before gambling.

I don’t mean to say that gambling was a good thing in any capacity. I wasted years of my life and became a significantly shittier person during it, and I lost and stole a lot of money, but if there’s any positives I can take away, I’m going to. I also don’t mean to say I’m still starving myself or not taking care of myself, I’ll still purchase things that for the benefit of my health and well being, I just don’t buy anything that is stupid or unnecessary.

1p9fj4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ViaRail/comments/1p9fj4k/the_canadian_a_november_2025_trip_report/,The Canadian - A November 2025 Trip Report,"We recently got home from a lovely 4 day trip, early November, going westbound from Toronto to Vancouver. We were fortunate and had actually booked a year in advance during last year’s Black Friday 40% discount + BCAA 20% off for berths in the sleeper class. We ended up paying approx. $700 per person for the trip. 

Amazing food, calming views, great staff. The only thing I regretted was that we fell asleep and missed any chance of seeing the aurora in the dome car.

Some thoughts and tips I wanted to share while fresh in my mind for anyone looking to do this trip 

General thoughts:
- Early November, not really much snow, only through Northern Ontario and the Rockies. Sunshine but cold through the Prairies, and of course, rain in BC.
- As a Canadian, what a way to experience the true size of our nation, and it still only covered half of the country! And as a west coaster… what the hell Northern Ontario? TWO DAYS?!
- Going westbound means you gain an hour every day, it makes getting up in time for breakfast easier. I like to sleep in, so I was worried before the trip.
- The Park car/bullet car is cool and booking off-season means you get unlimited access, but it honestly wasn’t really necessary. We preferred the Skyline car. The Skyline car has more leg room, less warped windows, and on our trip, more lively activity. The Park car was just very quiet and felt very serious. You can always grab a fancy drink back there and bring it to other cars. A note that the Park car also felt bumpier and there was more swaying at speed. You can always leave your devices to charge or take timelapses out the very back if you want, people never minded.
- The Park car also has the nicer public washroom - go there for your poop, use the nicer car’s amenities!
- Don’t be worried about charging your devices, plugs everywhere, the staff will watch your stuff if you’re really worried, but you will know everyone by day 2 and I never felt like I had to be cautious.
- Go to bingo and trivia and wine/beer tastings! They’re alot of fun, even kids can participate (they get pop and juice instead)
- Don’t be a seat hog. If you’re sitting in the front of the skyline car with the good views and you’ve been there all day, that doesn’t mean you need to leave your stuff on the table when you go for lunch to “save your spot”.
- It gets DRY! Especially as you go through the Prairies, bring lotion for your dry cracking skin. It’ll recover once you hit the BC humidity.

Berths:
- We were in berths, so had to get up for the beds to turn back to seats, and because of the time changes, it was much easier than I anticipated. 
- But keep in mind the halls are very narrow, especially when the beds and curtains are up. Expect to need to move the ladder to move things around if you need to. But the attendants are awesome, if you need a bag placed on the bed instead of underneath, just ask and they’ll do it for you every time they make the bed!
- We picked the berths for the wider bed width and also so that our heads were facing the direction of travel, I didn’t want to be sideways to the direction of travel and felt the rolling at every slow down. But this is a personal preference.
- In the sleeper cars, the women’s washroom has a whole seating space, with a stool and a shelf and a plug! You can charge your devices in there and not worry about balancing it over the sink like in the men’s washroom. Yet another reason to use the Park car for poops and save this one for charging.
- I tend to run cold, and the berths were nice and cozy, no extra blankets needed. My husband said the lower bunk was warmer than he liked, so we ended up switching. Jokes on him, I got the window and watched the stars while falling asleep.
- I loved the bench seats of the berths! If you get 3U and 3L, you have more privacy compared to 1U/1L and 2U/2L which are directly across from each other. 

Food:
- You won’t go hungry, tea and hot chocolate and cookies and snacks and Oreos all the time. The coffee is okay, could be better, but my husband is a coffee snob. If the Skyline car runs out of anything, just check at the Park car.
- Yes, wake up for breakfast. And the day going through the Rockies has brunch with amazing bennies! 
- Get the tenderloin. The cold beet-cured salmon was okay. Ginger beef was shockingly good. 
- If you REALLY need pop/soda, buy and bring your own cans/bottles, and then ask the bar for ice. Otherwise it’s $4 for a coke.
- We always got the last seating for meals so we didn’t feel rushed. It also meant we could ask for a second dessert if we wanted to, like the strawberry cake. This meant that while the first and second seating went to eat, the Skyline car cleared out and we could take our turns in the dome car seats during daylight. We were happy to eat with no views.

Reading Material:
- Over the 4 days, I listened to two audiobooks:
1) “[The Company: The Rise and and Fall of the Hudson’s Bay Company](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/610847/the-company-by-stephen-r-bown/9780385694094)” by Stephen Bown, and 
2) “[Dominion: The Railway and the Rise of Canada](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.ca/books/690690/dominion-by-stephen-r-bown/9780385698740)” by Stephen Bown. 
- From start to finish, listening back to back, with breaks for meals and attending bingo/beer tasting, both books together lasted the full trip. I started in Toronto as we pulled away, and finished the second book as I laid in bed during the last night. I listen at 1.2x so YMMV.
- My forever memory of the train is how we slowly stop-start trudged through Northern Ontario while I listened to how the Voyagers navigated and portaged those exact same rivers 300 years ago; rumbling through Manitoba while listening to the recount of the Métis’s Red River resistance; speeding through but then slowing right the fuck down at the Rockies while listening to how workers laid down 10 km of rail a day on the flats of Alberta/Saskatchewan but could only blast 2 m of rock per day in BC; and hearing about how the very tunnels we were traveling through were due to the dangerous jobs of the Chinese workers who made the construction through the mountains possible… To learn about the human ambition of nation building, cost of so many lives deemed expendable, the frustrating injustices and lasting impacts to our Indigenous peoples, all in the name of creating this incredibly important railway which we all benefit from WHILE I was sat on the train, it felt strange and surreal. It definitely made me appreciate the railway so much more.

- For guidebooks, there are two main options: 
1) Trans-Canada Rail Guide by Melissa Graham: Waste of money, DO NOT buy it. It lacks ALOT of information, and anything it does have is outdated. It even skipped Saskatoon!!
2) [Canada by Train by Chris Hanus](https://www.indigo.ca/en-ca/canada-by-train-the-complete-via-rail-travel-guide/9780988160200.html): Find a copy and buy it, absolutely worth the money. It has all the routes, even discontinued routes (the book does say which are discontinued and only included for context and information). It has train car layout diagrams and cutaways, signal light and sign explanations, history of train station buildings, notable people and place names, it’s a fantastic resource. We saw the 3rd edition being sold at the Jasper ViaRail station too! Unfortunately, it is difficult to find online, you may need to check used book selling sites like ebay or Thriftbooks.

People:
- The kind of person who would take a 4 day train journey through sporadic cell service and freight delays is, in my biased opinion, the best and interesting kind of person. 
- We met visitors from all over the globe, from Australian train-nerds, to toddlers conquering the dome car stairs, to young people with a train ticket discount and time to kill, to retirees checking off a bucket list item. We met people who knew exactly the track widths and car type name codes, to people like us, who just wanted to ride the train.
- You really do end up knowing your fellow passengers, to the point where when “new people” got on the train in Edmonton just to do the Edmonton/Vancouver route to see the Rockies, the vibe changed. Not worse, just different.
- The staff are amazing, both sets of crew. They knew how to keep us entertained and well fed. They can't control train and schedule delays, but they had wine and knew how to use it.
- The lack of cell reception and the slow way of travel means you are forced to also slow down. You talk to strangers and learn about their lives (I never learned a single person’s name yet I can tell you about their families and some hopes and dreams). You enjoy the little things, like spotting a fox on the prairie, laughing at a stupid joke about time zones during trivia, and eating a damn good tenderloin dinner.
- You will leave the train with a new and strong opinion on infrastructure, and how the concept of passenger trains sharing the same tracks as freight is stupid. But also okay, building railways across a giant country is really really really hard.

TL;DR - Highly recommend, would do it again. Find a sale and use your CAA/BCAA for discounts. Bring a good book. ",26,1764390164.0,ViaRail,5,1.0,False
1p9fhp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1p9fhp1/breville_charged_415_to_repair_machine_and_has/,"Breville charged $415 to ""repair"" machine and has now sent it back twice without fixing it","My wife and I have a Breville Dual Boiler (BES920XL) bought in 2017 that has done fine for most of its life. Recently, we began having very poor water pressure when pulling shots. Instead of getting 8-10 bar pressure, we starting getting 3ish bar or even less. We've been using the same grinder with the same settings for a few years, but we tried grinding finer, coarser, we tried to up our WDT tool use and tamping game. Nothing changed, so it clearly was an issue with the machine and when I was unable to drain the left boiler at all during a descale attempt, I suspected there was a blockage in the left boiler and maybe that was causing the problem, but I'm just a normal dude who knows nothing about anything, so... (



(As a side note, we use a Breville Smart Grinder Pro bought around the same time as the machine. At the time, we read reviews which indicated minor clumping easily fixed with WDT and therefore rated a better value than the Rancilio Rocky that we were going to buy. Also, we clean and descale when the machine notifies us each time, but haven't kept track of a specific schedule)



In August, my wife contacted Breville customer service and explained the problem. The support person asked for a detailed explanation of the problem, then wanted to see video and they did facetime or something so he could see what was happening. He kept talking about how important fresh coffee was. My wife said something along the lines of: ""My husband roasts our coffee himself and we've tried literally just-roasted coffee, but I don't see how that makes the pressure drop compared to week-old or even older coffee. The water is just barely dripping out with no portafilter on and regardless of age, the coffee is ground in the same grinder at the same settings we used when we were getting good shots. We've tried grinding nearly as fine as Turkish ground and it doesn't improve. Its clearly the machine. We suspect it may be related to the left boiler not draining during descaling."" He talked a little more about fresh coffee and finally said to send it in and they'd inspect it and quote any repairs. He also mentioned if they were unable to fix it, they'd replace the machine.

  
We sent in the machine for repairs and were quoted $415.05, so we paid that and they ""fixed"" the machine and sent it back. The first time we tried with the ""repaired"" machine, we realized nothing had changed. The shots were watery, we were still getting sub 3-bar pressure, and the left boiler still didn't drain during descale. So my wife tried everything she could think of for a couple weeks and finally called Breville customer service. They asked her to please use messaging through her Breville account and she did. After several frustrating back-and-forth messages over a few weeks they finally called and once again talked at length about fresh coffee and they had her pull several shots while they watched on video. It was like they had a script and had no clue what they were talking about. Finally after explaining the same things over and over, she said something along the lines of, ""Look, we sent the machine in for repairs. We paid for those repairs. We received the machine back and it clearly wasn't repaired. What I want is for you to make the repairs you supposedly completed in the first place. Its hard to believe no one even checked to make sure the machine actually worked before you sent it back to us supposedly repaired."" So they had her return it to fix the repairs under the 3-month warranty they offer on repair work.

  
A week or so later, they sent her a bill for repairs. She told them she'd already paid and wanted the machine actually fixed like they claimed it was when they'd done the ""repairs"" two months earlier. Then she got a message saying the machine was fixed and on its way. We got it today and nothing has changed. Its now at or beyond three months since the ""repairs"" were completed initially, so I don't know if they're pulling some scheme to run out the clock on the three-month repair warranty or they're just incompetent. Either way, we're $415 poorer, with a slightly lowered IQ just from dealing with Breville customer service, and we're getting cranky because we've had to drink press pot or moka pot coffee for several months now.

  
tldr: Breville charged us to fix machine, returned unfixed, made it a hassle to re-return for actual repairs, attempted to charge again, then returned unrepaired, all while claiming it was repaired.",1,1764390042.0,BrevilleCoffee,1,1.0,False
1p9fhna,https://www.reddit.com/r/PartneredYoutube/comments/1p9fhna/how_to_choose_a_name_of_my_new_channel/,How to choose a name of my new channel?,"So, I am starting a completely new channel, and I want to do it right, starting with the name. I want a catchy name that is true to the nature of my channel. Short but powerful. I have been racking my brains for months and find myself with analysis paralysis. I have come with a lot of names I like, but can't convince myself to pull the trigger on any of them.

My channel is going to be very similar to The Outdoors Boys, if Luke and his wife decided to live a life of van camping and travel after their kids were grown. The difference is that, my wife and I have a love story for the history books that would rival Romeo and Juliet, if they had not killed themselves and won the battle of class, racial, and cultural warfare. Much like in episodes of the Meat Eater, and many other reality shows, we will have cutaways (i.e. IV, Confessional, Talking Heads) in our videos where we talk about our history and stories from our past, to add spice, excitement, adventure, and drama to our show.

I want a name that hooks people, but that does not deceive them. I mean, **Grandparents Camping in a Van Telling Stories**, is a little on the nose, but it worked for Seinfeld (Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee). But our show will not be exclusively about van camping. There will be other styles to our show, just like the Outdoor Boys. Our show is going to be primarily about us, and what we are doing in the show is just a backdrop to our story.

So should go with something like,

**Rick & Aiyana's Amazing Adventures** (Not our real names BTW)

Or maybe a name that embraces our story, such as,

**Love Conquers All**

Or maybe something that combines the two like,

**Impossible Love, Amazing Adventures**

You see the difficulty I am having? How does one decided on a name? I need advice.",2,1764390037.0,PartneredYoutube,2,1.0,False

Dan and Amy Part 46

Sunday morning shortly after 7:00 two little bodies invaded the bed. There were tickles and giggles. It was incredibly fun. However the boys had questions. 

“Why are your clothes laying around by the pool?” Russ asks. 

“We took a swim last night after we got home from the wedding.” Dan replies, thinking fast and not a total lie. 

“Where are your wet swimsuits?” Todd asks innocently. “Mom gets mad if you don’t hang them in the shower to dry.”

“I’m going to help Julie with breakfast!” Amy says as she bounces out of bed. “ Yeah, where are are swimsuits Grandpa?” She asks heading out the door. 

Dan starts playing tickle monster, with the boys.  Trying to distract them, as he stalls, for time to think. 

Amy heads to the kitchen and finds Steve making coffee. 

“You better go rescue your Dad before the boys find out what skinny dipping is!”

“Oh Shit! Thanks.”

He takes off towards the guest bedroom. “Boys! How about a pre breakfast swim!”

Julie starts to come out of the bedroom, sees Amy and motions for her to come over. They step into the bedroom. 

“Well you two were certainly horny when you got home last night.” Julie says as she pulls Amy in close. They shared a very slow and passionate kiss. 

“Weddings do that to Daddy. So you watched?!”

“How could I not! Two of the sexiest people I know having wild passionate sex by my pool. Honestly, I’ve always had a school girl crush on Dad. He has this sexy mature man vibe. I love my husband, but there have been some impure thoughts.”

“I call Dan my silver fox! You got your turn by the pool though.”

“Honestly, Steve finds you breath taking. He is so happy for Dan.”

Amy blushes. “Thank you, but how can he even look at other women with you in his bed?”

“Steve told me once, that when he quits looking, burry him, because life isn’t worth living anymore. That he can appreciate beauty but it’s only skin deep. There is only one woman owns his heart and soul.”

“Dan and I take a shower together every morning at home. He tells me if he ever takes it for granted, he is an idiot and doesn’t deserve to live.”

“He is a wise and very horny man.”

Amy smiled. “We are lucky girls.”

They both had to giggle at that. 

“The pregnancy test is by the sink in the master bathroom. I’m going to start breakfast.”

XOXOXOXO  

Everyone is around the table and has had their fill of French toast. There is finally a lull in the conversation. 

“Everyone, Julie and I have some news.” Steve announces with a big smile. “Boys, you guys are going to be big brothers.”

Dan and Amy cheer. The boys are full of questions but completely excited. Hugs are given all the way around. At the end, Julie smiles at Amy. She gives her hand a squeeze and a wink. 

Amy heads to the bedroom to change into her travel clothes. She puts on Dan’s favorite golf skirt and a sleeveless top.  Hair in a messy bun and a pair of Birkenstocks. Julie knocks on the door and pops her head in. 

“Just wanted to tell you goodbye. Please come back to see us again soon. The boys had so much fun.”

“You know don’t you.”

Julie smiles. “I was 90% sure, then I heard you squeal. Don’t worry, nobody will find out from me.”

“I’m not going to lie Julie, having you close by would be great. I love you and your family. Actually I love all of Dan’s family. They treat me like I belong there.” Amy starts to feel her emotions rising. 

“Sweetheart, we aren’t just Dan’s family. We are your family.”

Amy smiled through tears of joy. “Thank you.”

Julie holds Amy, while she composes herself. Wipes away her tears and helps her fix her makeup. They hold hands as they walk back to the kitchen. 

“Boys, what do you want to tell Grandpa Dan and Amy.”

Todd goes first. “Thank you for coming to see us. We had fun with you two swimming.”

Russ went next. “Grandpa you make a great tickle monster and the go karts were awesome. Grandma Amy, you need to marry Grandpa, cause I want a real grandma.”

Amy hugs both the boys. She can’t say anything without crying. 

“I love you guys!” Is all she can get out, without loosing it. 

Dan gets his hugs as he watches Amy try to regain her composure. 

Dan starts to load the Jeep, Todd and Russ help so it takes longer. 

Steve walks up and hugs Amy. 

“What voodoo do you cast on the men in this family! First Dad, then my boys!”

Amy laughs. “Well they are just Dan version 3.0. Hopefully they have worked out the bugs. I hear 2.0 is a bit glitchy.”

Steve laughs freely, just like Dan. Him and Julie walk Amy to the Jeep and the four of them send Dan and Amy off. 

XOXOXOXO 

As they get on the road, Amy calls Grandma Deb. Who had to admit that she missed church, because Dan had been a bad influence and kept buying her vodka tonics. 

When she called Frosty, he picked up immediately. They talked for 20 minutes, reliving the evening and plans for dinner Monday evening. 

Finally, she turned her full attention on Dan. 

“So do your grandsons know what skinny dipping is now?” She asks with a mischievous grin. 

“Yep. I told them Grandma Amy doesn’t like wearing clothes around the pool!”

“Asshole. True, but still an asshole!”

Dan chuckles and holds Amy’s hand as they rack up the miles. 

About 2 hours into the trip, Amy gets a call from Jade. She puts her on speaker. 

“So what time are you guys getting back to the farm?” She asks. 

“About 3:30. Why?” Dan asks. 

“I need some Dan and Amy time.” Jade says. “Dinner is at 5:30 at Rachel and Jacks. So we will have an hour and a half.”

“This sounds serious.” Amy teases. 

“It is. I need to eat pussy and get pounded.” Jade says, leaving no room for misinterpretation. 

“What’s wrong?” Amy asks. 

“Nothings wrong, you guys are going to leave for almost 2 weeks and I need to see you.”

Dan smiles. “ Something can be worked out. We will see you at 3:30.”

Amy looks at Dan. “What the hell was that?!”

“That was wild child Jade. Knowing what she wants and how she wants it.”

Just then a text pings through.  

‘Sorry didn’t mean to be so blunt. Need to be with you guys though.’

Amy reads it to Dan. Then types back. 

‘All OK. Looking forward to it.’

“That is the wild child coming out. We are in for a fun time.” Dan says failing to hide his smile. 

“You’re a little too happy about this Daddy!” Amy teases. 

“You’re the one in control my dear. My heart belongs only to you.”

“Even after seeing Julie? That woman is gorgeous.”

“She is beautiful, but does absolutely nothing for me. I prefer beautiful blondes with sexy piercings. That have a kinky side.”

Amy chuckles. “I do understand something you said better now. You need the emotional connection. Otherwise it is just an act. Pleasurable but still an act.”

“My dear, you are about to have an encounter with a woman as powerful and passionate as you.”

“I’m not sure I’m understanding what you mean.”

“The two of you are different. Driven. Self sufficient. A passion for life that I wish everyone had.”

XOXOXOXO 

They pull up the lane at 3:18. Dan was incredibly proud of himself for beating the estimated arrival time.

“You are amazing Daddy for beating the time.” Amy teased. 

“Thank you for the proper appreciation of this achievement.” 

They hauled everything into the house. Amy went to freshen up. On the way to the bathroom, she grabbed the strap on. After freshening up, she put it on, underneath her skirt. Then headed to the den to relax. 

A few minutes later, Jade pulls into the yard. She comes into the house. Hugs and kisses are given. 

“Come sit in the den.” Dan announces. 

“How was the weekend?” Jade asked.  

Amy smiled and answered, not even giving Dan a chance. 

“Friday night, Dan fucked me twice by the pool. Wearing a tiny bikini. Then Saturday night, we fucked by the pool again. Julie actually watched us from inside.”

Both Jade and Dan were shocked by Amy’s bluntness. However she was just getting started. 

“What is your safe word? Slut.” Amy inquired. 

“Doughnut.” Jade replied. Suddenly off kilter. 

“If you think, that you deserve to be fucked by my man, you need to give a blow job first. Take off your clothes.”

Jade was enjoying how this was going. She pulled off her tank top, revealing her slightly sagging mom boobs. Still incredibly sexy. Then slipped off her shorts, to reveal a full back white cotton panty. It was incredibly sexy in it’s own way. She owned it and was not ashamed. She then slid them off onto the hard wood floor of the den. Her kitty was clean shaven, with a prominent clit. 

The tramp stamp and red lips on her right butt cheek were plainly visible. There was a two inch tall heart tattoo just above her kitty. Then towards her right hip in a beautiful script were two words. Daddy’s Slut. 

Jade then turned to Dan and began to unbuckle his pants, to release his cock. 

“What are you doing?” Amy demands. Jade looks confused. “You need to suck my cock!”

Lifting the front of her skirt to reveal an eight inch realistic cock. 

At this point, Dan knew that he was just a pawn in this game. Amy was in charge. 

Jade moved over to in front of Amy. She proceeded to give the dildo a sloppy blow job. While Jade was blowing the dildo, Amy removed her top and motioned for Dan to get naked.  

While Jade was attempting to deep throat the dildo, Amy suddenly grabbed her hair and thrust the cock down her throat. Holding it there, till Jade slapped her thigh. Sputtering and gasping, she was dragged to the couch by her hair. 

“On the couch and on all fours slut!”

Jade did as she was told. Still trying to gather herself. Amy positioned herself in front of Jade. 

“Continue.” Amy ordered. 

The blow job began again. Amy motioned for Dan to get behind Jade. He slid his cock into her folds. This drew a whimper. In just a few strokes they were in time pounding into Jade.  

It took just a few strokes before Jade released a flood onto the couch. 

“A good slut will clean up her mess when we are done with her!” Amy said. She was relishing her roll in this foray. 

Suddenly Amy pulls out. 

“Daddy, on your back, on the couch.” Dan complied. “Lay down on him and put his cock in you.” Jade does as ordered. Dan begins to thrust slowly into her. 

Amy gets behind and on top of Jade and begins to slide the dildo into her kitty also. 

Jade begins to quiver. The stretch was incredible and the feeling of being filled full with two cocks made her squirt again. 

Dan cursed. “Fuck, this feels good!” Grabbing Amy and dragging her down for a kiss. This forced the dildo deeper, causing Amy and Dan to both orgasm. Releasing into Jade. 

All three of them laid there, covered in sweat and cum. Just trying to catch their breath. Amy starts to laugh uncontrollably. She wipes away the tears and looks at Jade. 

“Doughnut? That’s your safe word!”
