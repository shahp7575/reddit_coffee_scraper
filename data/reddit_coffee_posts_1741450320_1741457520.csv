1j6mqs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianUniversalism/comments/1j6mqs6/my_testimony/,My Testimony,"God has blessed my family and given my family and me so many second chances at life and living that I hope we do not waste them. Everything I have written has happened to my family and me, and there may be more things than I can remember. These wondrous things that have happened to us are in chronological order and span five decades, from 1975 to 2025. I feel and know that God looks after his own, for I have experienced that. I know many things have happened to my family and me, but these happenings are spread over a fifty-year period, and a lot can happen in fifty years in a person's life and a family's life.

 

When I was a teenager, my family had a swimming pool and one day, in the summer of 1975, I was swimming alone in the pool as I was home, and I dived into the pool far too deep for the pool itself and as a result of the dive my chin hit the bottom of the pool with a loud clicking sound and with much force, My life could have ended with me floating or sinking in the pool and drowning as I was by myself in the pool. If I were paralysed, I would not have been able to save myself and get out of the pool.

 

When I was approaching the end of Year 10, in 1975, my parents arranged for a transfer to a new school for me to study Music the following year as my current school was not offering that in Years 11 and 12. I got a transfer to the school, although I was outside its catchment area, and in doing so, I managed to go to a better school as I was bullied in junior high. The bullying stopped and did not happen at the new school, and I got to study Music. That is God making things happen, as I was not in the catchment area for the new school when I went to junior high, and I still was not in their catchment area, and I got to study music and evade the bullies. I got a place in the new school.

 

When I studied hard to get through Years 11 and 12, I scored high enough in my Higher School Certificate to attend Macquarie University, study History, and get a Bachelor of Arts. The university was a bit tough at times, but I got through them and graduated.

 

When I met Jackie at a Christian Youth Group called Young Life, and we dated each other, my mum told me after just a couple of weeks that I should let Jackie know how I felt about her. And so, one night a week later, I did, and we went from boyfriend and girlfriend to steady to engaged on that one night as I proposed to her. She said “Yes”, and I did not even have a ring. I was not planning to propose that night, it just happened. I had known Jackie for less than six weeks at the time. My mother got me to follow my heart and not my head, for Jackie had already captured my heart, and she still has it, and mums know who is right for their boys.

 

When my mum showed me an advertisement for a government job, I had just finished university and was due to be married in less than two months, but I got one from them. I even asked for leave without pay for my honeymoon when I was being interviewed for the job. I stayed in that job for over eighteen years, and everything was okay once I started working to take time off for my honeymoon.

 

We got married on 5th December 1981, and the next day, we set out on our honeymoon. On our way to Forster, we were on the freeway heading north from Hornsby, and a woman in the lane next to us had a trailer. She puts on her blinker and starts to move over into our lane, but we are in her blind spot. I try to move over and give her room and slow down, but we are all at highway speeds, and she is still moving over increasingly into my lane. And I blasted my horn. She entered my lane, leaving me with nowhere to go as there were traffic safety barriers on the side of the road and a ditch. I was into them, and she finally heard me and realised that we were there and moved back into her lane; on our honeymoon, we had a dangerous start to our married life.

 

When we were newly married and renting a unit in West Ryde, a bill came in that we could not pay. Then, a cheque arrived in the mail the day after we got that bill, and it was not too late to pay it. We were not expecting the cheque. We did not know the cheque was coming, and it was for a couple of dollars less than the bill. Now, we can pay the bill.

 

When we rented that unit, we asked if we could put a deadlock in the door. The real estate agreed that we should give them a set of keys and leave the lock on the door after we vacated the unit. A couple of months later, all the units in the unit block were burgled except for ours and one other. A total of ten units in the block of twelve units were burgled, but of the two that were not, both of those units had deadbolts, and one of the units was ours. The remaining units did not have deadlock, and they all had the same type of lock that made it easy to break into the units.

 

When we had our first car, a green Holden HQ Kingswood sedan, someone stole it from the unit carpark. Fortunately, it was found later that day in Eastern Creek but was written off. The police found the car without us having to wait months for the insurance company to decide when they would have paid out the claim if the vehicle had not been found and recovered.

 

We were renting the unit at West Ryde, and it was almost time to renew the lease or move out; we had not made up our minds about which way we were going to jump; my parents had decided to go on an extended holiday for four months overseas, and so the decision is made for us as we were asked to housesit for them. We did not have much furniture, and my parents had a large downstairs room we could live in, and we had a toilet and shower to use next to the room. My parents had prepaid all their bills, so we do not have any to pay them. We were provided a place to live rent-free while they were away and for a couple of months when they returned home.

 

When we moved out of my parents' house, we found a unit to rent for a year in Meadowbank. During that year and the time, we spent at my parents' house before that, we saved up enough money to deposit on another unit in Meadowbank. We paid off a small personal loan and bought the unit. We exited the rental market and entered a mortgaged unit we owned.

 

When we had been married for six years, and our parents asked us when we would give them grandchildren, we had not even thought about having children as we had been too busy with work, holidays and looking after my younger brother Christopher on many occasions. We decided to try to have a child. It only took six weeks for Jackie to fall pregnant after being on the pill for eight years, and she carried Michelle to full term. Michelle was born with the aid of forceps as she was not positioned right for the birth, and then the birth went smoothly because of the skill of the doctor and the use of the forceps.

 

When we realised, before Michelle was born, how difficult it would be to bring up a baby in a top-floor unit without a laundry and that disposable nappies were not around, we decided to sell the unit and buy a house. Still, we must first find a buyer for the unit and a house to live in. The unit was sold on the day it was listed, and the house hunt began. We found a house to buy and moved in before our daughter was born. That is God who found us the buyer so quickly, and even though we looked at many houses, we found one to buy at the right time, so we were able to move into the house on the same day that the unit sale was finalised when the new owners took possession of the unit.

 

When we were shopping at Blacktown Westpoint, Michelle was a year old, so we had a trolley, a pram, and a package to get out of the lift. We pushed the pram out first, and then both Jackie and I went back into the lift to get the rest. The lift door shuts on us, and the lift starts moving up to the next floor, leaving Michelle alone in her pram on the floor we just came from. We hurried down to that floor after the lift stopped higher up and found the pram surrounded by several elderly ladies, all wondering where the mother was. Michelle was not alone; she had got the ladies' attention and was not taken away by anyone or abducted.

 

When I hit a semi-trailer, I got a written-off car as the whole front of the car, from both front doors to the front bumper bar, was damaged as I had lost control of the vehicle on a wet road, and we were headed for a telegraph pole. I slid across three lanes of the road without being in control of the car, but we hit the truck instead and were pushed by the impact back into the lane we started instead of the telegraph pole being wrapped around the pole. The car got written off by the insurance company. Nothing happened to me; my wife Jackie got whiplash and got over it successfully, and our two-year-old daughter Michelle got the imprint of the buckle from her safety child car seat on her stomach. The insurance company replaces the child's car seat, but she is okay.

 

Years later than the accident, we have a second child, Marcus, who would not have been born if we had perished in the crash, and decades later than that, I realise how fortunate we were to have survived the crash as we would not have had Marcus if we had died. He would never have existed, for he had not even been conceived then. The truck was in the right place at the right time to stop us from hitting the telegraph pole.

 

When we tried for another child, months went on, and we lost heart and thought it was never going to happen, and it did not; we stopped actively trying for a child, and then Jackie fell pregnant after we had given up trying for one. We got a second child.

 

When my youngest child, Marcus, was three years old, my wife Jackie was doing housework, and she was home alone with Marcus that day when she heard an audible voice inside her room. It was spoken out aloud, and no one was there, and the voice was telling her to go and check on Marcus. She went out the front of the house to look for him, and he was on the road. She gathers him and takes him back inside, and he is safe from any potential harm from any vehicle on the road.

 

When we were on holiday in Dubbo, and we were all in a large op-shop, and our four-year-old son, Marcus, went off by himself, which he usually does in a store, but usually, he stays in any store that we’re in, but this time he leaves the store, and we did not know that he had left the store. My wife, daughter, and I looked for him, but he was not in the store. So, we left the store and turned to the left, not the right, although we had no idea which way he went, and we started walking away from the store. Then, we met up with a man and his wife walking toward us. He is holding Marcus high up in his arms, and Marcus is safe; the man says he picked up Marcus as Marcus was crossing a road by himself at the pedestrian crossing, and it did not look right to the man, as Marcus was not walking with any parents. So, he picked up Marcus and backtracked with Marcus to see if he could find us. He did find us, and we were reunited with our son.

 

When we were on holiday driving back from Melbourne to Sydney, our children were young, and we were at a roadside rest stop with a toilet. Our older child Michelle wanted to go to the off she went by herself. To my horror, I realised it was a pit toilet. I told my wife Jackie to run after our daughter, and my wife got there and managed to save our daughter from disappearing into the pit of poo and wee that was below the toilet seat because the toilet is made for adult bottoms, not smaller children’s bottoms. Fortunately, our child had left the toilet door open so Jackie could grab her before she disappeared into the pit below her. Michelle almost fell in, and she would have drowned in the pit if she had fallen in.

 

When we were so broke that all we could afford to eat was sausages and potato mash for weeks, we fed our family; my wife, Jackie, talked to some of the ladies at the church we were going to She spoke of how hard we were finding it financially, and someone we never found out who did it put an envelope in the offering tray with our name on it, and it had $100 in notes. In the nineties, $100 was considered a substantial amount of money. One of the church’s elders gave us the envelope containing the money. We were at our lowest financial point.

 

After leaving that church, as Marcus was a bit too much for them, he was the only special needs child in the church, and Marcus had behavioural issues. We started going to another church where Marcus was accepted for who he was. Jackie and I went through the waters of an adult baptism. We found a new church suitable for Marcus and for us to acknowledge God as our Lord through an adult baptism.

 

When I was on holiday with my family in Melbourne, on yet another holiday in Melbourne, and we were lost and parked on the side of the road, a truck came over the hill from behind us and hit our car. Still, all that was hit was our driver's door exterior mirror, the only part of the car that broke. It could have been a lot worse if the truck had been a little bit closer to us, as our car would have been pushed forward violently from behind by the truck. It would have been a bad accident, potentially a fatal one.

 

When I was on that holiday to Melbourne with my family, we were on a bus the day we left the car for the mirror repair. We were having difficulty settling Marcus, and a lady came over and prayed for my family and me Marcus settled down. We needed that intercessory prayer. She said that God told her to pray for us, so she did.

 

When my wife Jackie had a series of mini-strokes, and we already had two children, we were told that she had to go off the pill right then and that I would need a vasectomy as an operation to tie her tubes would have been too dangerous for Jackie to have as would another pregnancy and childbirth as she could die from either the operation, or from pregnancy or giving birth and so I went ahead with getting the vasectomy, and we had counselling. I wanted to keep Jackie safe, alive, and well, and we made the right decision about me getting the vasectomy. I got to keep my wife safe by getting the vasectomy and enabling Jackie to be still alive. Otherwise, I would have become a widower with small children.

 

After experiencing chest pain for a long time, months, and months, in mid-1999, I visited a doctor at the recommendation of my wife. X-rays, ultrasounds, and a biopsy showed that my thyroid gland had significantly enlarged and extended deep down into my chest cavity. It was pushing my oesophagus, windpipe out of the way, and my other organs.  If it were not for my wife getting me to see the doctor, I would have died once the windpipe had fully closed because I could live without food for a while if my oesophagus had closed, but I cannot live without air if my windpipe had closed. Getting a hole put in my neck to use for breathing would not have worked for breathing as the windpipe and oesophagus were much lower down in my chest cavity where they were being squished. The surgeon was able to remove the thyroid through my neck as he was thinking at first of cracking open my ribcage to get at the thyroid from below it as it was deep, far down into my chest cavity, which would have had more risks and a more complicated period of recovery. Still, he was able to remove the thyroid through my neck and hide the scar in a skin fold. I got through the entire process of getting the medical and surgical help I needed.

 

When I was awaiting a phone call to find out if my thyroid was cancerous as I had had a biopsy and I was at work, a workmate told me that my wife was on the phone for me, and my wife Jackie said, ""There's no cancer"", and right then at that moment I felt two hands on my shoulders from behind me. I turned around to see who had touched me, and nobody was there; the nearest member of staff was three metres in front of me, and it was not her, yet I felt the hands on both of my shoulders; it was a physical touch as I did feel them.

 

When I saw a cat on TV that was twitching and moving while asleep, and it moved so much that it fell off the coffee table that it was lying on, and the commentator said the cat had REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder, I told my wife, “Look, that’s me.” I had been having dreams where I became active while dreaming instead of remaining passive, and I moved around and fell out of bed while fast asleep, which had happened several times. I went to the hospital and saw a sleep specialist, had a sleep study, and got diagnosed with REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder. The sleep doctor started talking about Parkinson’s Disease and my short-term memory issues. I watched a TV program I did not know was on as I was just channel surfing. It got me to make the connection between me and my sleeping behaviour and the cats and this led to a diagnosis of REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder.

 

When I had a shoulder ache, and it had been there for a long time, and I had not seen a doctor as I am a man, for it’ll be right and the church we were attending, had for the first time in the years we had been going there, they have a visiting healer. I got to the front, sat on the chair, and didn't tell the healer what was wrong with me; he didn't ask. I got holy oil on my forehead, was prayed over with the laying on of hands, and returned to my seat. Then I got a burning circle of hotness, red hot, right where my shoulder had been hurting, and after a while, the burning sensation went away, and I realised that the shoulder pain had gone and did not come back.

 

When my eldest child Michelle was getting bullied at high school, and Jackie and I decided to take her out of that school system altogether, we contacted another school. We were nowhere near their catchment area. Yet, they accepted her, and she settled into the new school, and the bullying stopped; she got to make some strong friendships. Later, one of the bullies from the other school starts at our daughter’s new school, and our daughter is OK as she now has a circle of true friends who tell that bully to leave her alone as the bully tried to bully her again and the bullying is nipped in the bud.

 

When our church closed as it was not viable, we joined a new church where we settled, and Marcus was accepted by that church, even though he had special needs. Congregation members had been praying for someone like Marcus to come along, and Marcus went to the new church with us. We got into a new church suitable for all my family.

 

When I enter a competition, many times to win $1000, and the community organisation I nominate in the competition will win $10,000, I pray about it. I nominate our new church, and so on. For every entry, I nominate our new church. I did well over thirty entries. I won $1000, and our new church got the $10,000. The cheques were timely for our new church and us and were needed when the Global Financial Crisis was on.

 

When Marcus is in Year 11, his high school tries to get him to sign himself out, leave the school permanently, and not return for Year 12. It would have been a bad idea as the community participation program he would have done after schooling had finished for him was for special needs people after they finished Year 12, not Year 11. A place was found for him at a dedicated special needs school for Year 12, which he completed. It was the best year of schooling that he ever had. Marcus went to the new school, the best place for him.

 

We renewed our wedding vows on our 30th wedding anniversary, and we did so in front of our church congregation. This time, unlike when we were married, I got to kiss the bride, as I did not get to kiss my bride in our wedding ceremony thirty years before. We publicly show our commitment to each other by renewing one of the important vows possible.

 

When Marcus and I boarded a crowded train full of people, I almost lost hold of him while pulling him into the carriage. I would have left him behind. We kept together as if Marcus had been left alone on the platform; I do not know what would have happened to him.

 

In a thundering thunderstorm, when the wind and the rain were pouring down a lot, the eucalyptus tree in the backyard fell over and landed on top of our house. It was a widow-maker. I was in the bathroom underneath the tree, and I was safe, and Marcus was in the kitchen, and he was safe. Most of the tree's weight was in its trunk, and the trunk was in the backyard, with many branches on top of the house as far as the front main bedroom.

 

When I noticed symptoms that were happening to me, I didn't know what was wrong with me. I saw a neurologist. “You have Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment,” and now I know what I’ve got, I can get help and treatment for it.  Now, my symptoms make sense to me, and the type of Mild Cognitive Impairment that I have doesn’t affect my long-term memory, only short-term memory and some of my power of thought. I got a diagnosis, and what the sleep specialist had talked about so many years before had come true as I ended up with Parkinson’s Disease.

 

My wife Jackie gave me the support and comfort that I needed after being diagnosed with a life-changing diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, and she continues to provide me with the support and comfort over the years before, during and after that diagnosis.

 

I drove through an intersection at 50 km per hour with a stop sign that I did not know was there. I did not think I was in an intersection, and I heard the car horn frantically blasting at me from another car as I should have stopped for them. I did not know they were there until they blasted their horn. I looked through my driver’s window, and all I could see was a car. It was getting closer and closer to us, and both drivers took evasive action, but I did not hit them. I should have stopped for them as they had the right of way. Our car did not roll with the manoeuvre I did, which was to turn the steering wheel hard to the left abruptly and then hard to the right to give us more room between our car and the other car. We missed the other car and the telegraph pole that the other driver thought we would hit after missing her car. She stops near our car, talks to us, and tells us she has her mum and her son in the car. I have my son and my wife, and if I had hit the other car, my family and I and her and her family might have been injured or died, with casualties in both cars. Still, I missed her and the telegraph pole.

 

After missing the car at the stop sign, I decided to stop driving that afternoon once I got home, and shortly after that, my neurologist and my GP forbade me from driving. I know they're both right anyway. I’ve already stopped driving as I know I’m a dangerous driver, driving dangerously on the road. I’m thankful they and I made the right decision to stop driving. I realised my driving days were over and getting me to accept that fact without second thoughts.

 

When I got into the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) on my third attempt at getting accepted into the NDIS, sometimes, God said, ‘Wait.’ Now, I can get the help that I need for my Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment from the NDIS. I got in with perfect timing onto the system when I was prepared for it,

 

After my diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, my wife and I decided that as I worsened, as that was likely to happen, she wouldn’t be able to look after Marcus and me, so we made the decision to find Marcus’s accommodation in a supported independent living share house as he’s special needs. A place is found for him, and he loves it. We know that after we die, Marcus will be looked after as he is in the system, and we made the right decision for his short-term and long-term living needs.

 

When I was in the hospital with Septic Shock because of a nasty bacterial infection from a bacteria called Proteus mirabilis, which is found in soil and potting mix, and I was a gardener as a hobby, I got blood poisoning. I was on life support and in a coma for three days and three nights. My heart was enlarged, my kidneys had shut down, a kidney stone blocked one of the ureters from one of my kidneys, I had blood poisoning, both of my lungs had been infected with that nasty bacterium, and I was on dialysis. My brain is in la-la-land as I have delirium, and the delirium persists well after I am brought out of the coma, as the delirium lasts for more than a week. I’m contagious with the bacteria, and I’m in ICU for ten days in a private room as I’m in isolation; visitors must put on disposable clothes, gloves, and a face mask to come into my room and then dispose of the clothing when they leave my room.

 

After the time I spent in the ICU, I was put in the general ward. I come through the whole lot OK without losing a hand or a foot or anything else to sepsis, as many people who end up with sepsis need to have their limbs amputated. As that part of them dies, or they die. For five thousand people a year, for approximately five thousand people die from sepsis in Australia. I got over the delirium, and I still remember the thoughts that I had while delirious. My wife Jackie was there with me for every one of those sixteen days that I was in the hospital, and she had to catch four buses a day to get in to see me and then go home, two each way. I got through sepsis and kept my body intact, and my wife was there every day for me.

 

Before finding out that I had blood poisoning and sepsis, I had pain. I went to the hospital earlier in the week, where they took blood, with the result that they were able to culture it and identify the specific bacteria that had infected me, so they didn’t have to hit it with a broad-spectrum drug and hope for the best but knew exactly what treatment and drug I would need. They stressed how urgent it was that I came back to the hospital for treatment, and I was in the operating theatre that night.

 

When I was getting a regular skin cancer check, the skin cancer specialist found a basal cell carcinoma on my nose that I did not know was there. He can remove all the skin cancer, and it is good that he got it all, as otherwise it would eat down through my nose and get bigger, resulting in complex facial surgery and reconstruction. I did not need a more complicated operation to catch and get rid of the skin cancer in time before it got worse.

 

I went on a cruise with my dad, just the two of us, on the Majestic Princess down to Tasmania from Sydney and back again, and we had a suite. It was just before COVID-19 entered the world when Dad could still get around, even though he was in his eighties, and we had a wonderful time together. We got time together that we usually would not have before he passed away a couple of years later.

 

After visiting my father, who was in a hospital at the time, during the COVID era, I was the one nominated visitor that he could have at the hospital and on my way back to the railway station, I hurried across a road with an active Don't Walk sign flashing on the traffic light crossing. I should not have been crossing the road as the Don't Walk had started flashing, and I fell onto the road in front of a bus. I do not know if the bus driver saw me go down. I was able to pick myself up off the ground and hobble away. I only hurt my elbow, and my shoe came off. Fortunately, the red arrow for the bus stayed red while I was on the crossing. I were still on the ground in front of the bus, if the red arrow had changed, the bus could have started moving right on top of me, running over me while I was on the ground. A woman on the opposite side of the road also called me to see if I was OK.

 

Also, on another day, when we travelled home by bus, I was carrying two shopping bags in each hand. I could not hold the seat next to me or the hand straps hanging down from the ceiling as I did not think of putting the bags down; anyway, there was not enough room in the bus for me to put them down. I tried to keep myself upright, and as the bus moved away from the bus stop, I lost my balance and started to fall onto a mother and her pram that had two babies in it. I was falling, and I could not do anything to stop myself. The pram was getting closer as I fell, and a woman sitting on the seat behind me managed to grab hold of me by my belt near my bottom and my shoulder. She pulled me upright before I landed on top of the two babies and their mum. I am not a light person as I am obese, yet she found the strength to pull me upright and the room in the bus to get to me before it was too late, and then someone offered me their seat after my fall.

 

My father, Bruce, passed away, and we had a funeral for him. Shortly after the funeral, we were allowed into his unit to clear it out, as Mum had passed away several years before Dad. I found out that Dad had kept many of the birthday, Christmas, and Father’s Day cards that we had given him as children, and they were in his bedside cabinet, and I had worn his wedding ring from the day of his death. I was shown how sentimental Dad was, as I did not expect him to be so sappy.

 

When Marcus, our special needs son, decided to leave his group house where he was living and went without telling the staff, and no one went with him, he got on a bus at Baulkham Hills and travelled to Rouse Hill, which was the last stop for the bus, by himself. We were on holiday in Hobart in another state, and the police contacted us; after that call, we could track where Marcus went by using his Opal public transport card, as Marcus knew how to tap on and off his Opal card. Opal allowed us to track his trip movements, and we rang the police and the house staff to tell them both what we had found out from Opal and the house staff. The police found him at Rouse Hill Shopping Centre. They heard him before they saw him, and Marcus talked loudly to himself. They turned around a corner at the shops, and there he was. Rouse Hill Shops is not your standard type of shopping centre, as it is spread over a large area instead of confined under one roof. Marcus was safe and able to be found by the police and the house staff.

 

Years after my father died, my wife, Jackie, stepped on an old answering machine that we were no longer using as we are on the NBN and a home phone is not needed; it’s on the floor, and a message is on it, and it starts playing, and the message is from my deceased father, recorded by him whilst he was alive. We did not know the message was on it. In the message, my dad tells me not to worry about anything and that he loves me. I now realise that I was meant to hear it when I needed to and recorded it on my computer. Now, I can listen to my dad whenever I need to or want to, even though after listening to him, I realise how much I miss him, and sometimes I am overcome by emotion, for I’m still grieving for him for I have lost a piece of my heart. It has been four years since he died, but I am not going to delete the recording as my dad is on it. It pains me that after Mum died, I was not enough to keep him alive and nor were the rest of my siblings, as all he wanted was to be with Mum. he had lost his will to live, and he had stopped eating, and now he is with Mum. We discovered the phone call when I needed to with the words of comfort on it from Dad, which are helping me in my grieving process.

 

When Jackie passed out and was in a diabetic coma last Mother’s Day at Featherdale Wildlife Park, the 000 operator gave us her full attention. The first aid staff from Featherdale looked after Jackie whilst we were waiting for the ambulance, and the ambulance came. Jackie was not in a coma once they arrived at Featherdale; she was taken to the hospital for observation and admitted to the hospital. As a result of the diabetic coma and hospital admission, Jackie started testing herself for the sugar readings for her diabetes and looking after herself and her diabetes better. Jackie was stirred into action regarding her diabetes.

 

A couple of weeks ago, a stray cat turned up on our doorstep and stayed, and he had no collar and no microchip. Jackie named him Max, and we have fallen in love with him. We got a chance to look after another cat and share our family and our home with him, and we have all fallen in love with Max,

 

In early February 2025, I made a new friend, Patrick, whom I call my little brother from another mother. Although taller than me, he is far younger and a Christian. I told him I only had one person to talk to: my wife, Jackie. Patrick gave me his phone number and said I could call him. Here is to a long friendship with Patrick. I now have a friend I can call when I want to talk to a friend.

 

This year, I am using support workers to take me to medical appointments and for social activities, which is something new for me as I used to spend most of my time at home alone. I’m getting out of the house and interacting with more people than I usually would.

 

In all that has happened to my family and me, God has always been there for us in the good times and the tough times. He has protected us over all the instances where we felt his Glory by God looking after us mentally, spiritually, physically, emotionally, financially, in times of illness and poor health, and in dangerous times on the road. God was always there in every situation, especially the ones that could have resulted in injury or death, for I am not so lucky to have all the things that have happened to me and my family by chance, instead it was all planned.  God gave me a wife, Jackie, who has always been there for me and my children, and for her; I am profoundly grateful to God for eternity long and then some for finding me a wife who loves me, and I love her.

For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11.

Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the Lord your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you. Deuteronomy 31:6.

Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Isaiah 41:10.

God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Psalm 46:1.

And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28.

For you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy. Psalm 63:7.

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. Psalm 23:4.

We serve an Awesome God.

We have an Awesome God.

Give all the Glory to God.

I don't really drink milk based drinks and if I do have options for steaming milk as in a own two frothers.  A Breville which I am not entirely happy with and I have one that came with my Nespresso machine.   Any suggestions on models to look at that will deliver a similar coffee to what I get now or even better if possible?  I understand the brew groups are all the same?  So I am not sure why there are so many models which seem all very similar.  Budget would be around $1200 or so USD even though I am in CAD :). Thanks,1,1741456556.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False
1j6mq6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenChristian/comments/1j6mq6j/my_testimony_about_god_and_my_family_and_i/,My Testimony about God and my family and I,"God has blessed my family and given my family and me so many second chances at life and living that I hope we do not waste them. Everything I have written has happened to my family and me, and there may be more things than I can remember. These wondrous things that have happened to us are in chronological order and span five decades, from 1975 to 2025. I feel and know that God looks after his own, for I have experienced that. I know many things have happened to my family and me, but these happenings are spread over a fifty-year period, and a lot can happen in fifty years in a person's life and a family's life.

 

When I was a teenager, my family had a swimming pool and one day, in the summer of 1975, I was swimming alone in the pool as I was home, and I dived into the pool far too deep for the pool itself and as a result of the dive my chin hit the bottom of the pool with a loud clicking sound and with much force, My life could have ended with me floating or sinking in the pool and drowning as I was by myself in the pool. If I were paralysed, I would not have been able to save myself and get out of the pool.

 

When I was approaching the end of Year 10, in 1975, my parents arranged for a transfer to a new school for me to study Music the following year as my current school was not offering that in Years 11 and 12. I got a transfer to the school, although I was outside its catchment area, and in doing so, I managed to go to a better school as I was bullied in junior high. The bullying stopped and did not happen at the new school, and I got to study Music. That is God making things happen, as I was not in the catchment area for the new school when I went to junior high, and I still was not in their catchment area, and I got to study music and evade the bullies. I got a place in the new school.

 

When I studied hard to get through Years 11 and 12, I scored high enough in my Higher School Certificate to attend Macquarie University, study History, and get a Bachelor of Arts. The university was a bit tough at times, but I got through them and graduated.

 

When I met Jackie at a Christian Youth Group called Young Life, and we dated each other, my mum told me after just a couple of weeks that I should let Jackie know how I felt about her. And so, one night a week later, I did, and we went from boyfriend and girlfriend to steady to engaged on that one night as I proposed to her. She said “Yes”, and I did not even have a ring. I was not planning to propose that night, it just happened. I had known Jackie for less than six weeks at the time. My mother got me to follow my heart and not my head, for Jackie had already captured my heart, and she still has it, and mums know who is right for their boys.

 

When my mum showed me an advertisement for a government job, I had just finished university and was due to be married in less than two months, but I got one from them. I even asked for leave without pay for my honeymoon when I was being interviewed for the job. I stayed in that job for over eighteen years, and everything was okay once I started working to take time off for my honeymoon.

 

We got married on 5th December 1981, and the next day, we set out on our honeymoon. On our way to Forster, we were on the freeway heading north from Hornsby, and a woman in the lane next to us had a trailer. She puts on her blinker and starts to move over into our lane, but we are in her blind spot. I try to move over and give her room and slow down, but we are all at highway speeds, and she is still moving over increasingly into my lane. And I blasted my horn. She entered my lane, leaving me with nowhere to go as there were traffic safety barriers on the side of the road and a ditch. I was into them, and she finally heard me and realised that we were there and moved back into her lane; on our honeymoon, we had a dangerous start to our married life.

 

When we were newly married and renting a unit in West Ryde, a bill came in that we could not pay. Then, a cheque arrived in the mail the day after we got that bill, and it was not too late to pay it. We were not expecting the cheque. We did not know the cheque was coming, and it was for a couple of dollars less than the bill. Now, we can pay the bill.

 

When we rented that unit, we asked if we could put a deadlock in the door. The real estate agreed that we should give them a set of keys and leave the lock on the door after we vacated the unit. A couple of months later, all the units in the unit block were burgled except for ours and one other. A total of ten units in the block of twelve units were burgled, but of the two that were not, both of those units had deadbolts, and one of the units was ours. The remaining units did not have deadlock, and they all had the same type of lock that made it easy to break into the units.

 

When we had our first car, a green Holden HQ Kingswood sedan, someone stole it from the unit carpark. Fortunately, it was found later that day in Eastern Creek but was written off. The police found the car without us having to wait months for the insurance company to decide when they would have paid out the claim if the vehicle had not been found and recovered.

 

We were renting the unit at West Ryde, and it was almost time to renew the lease or move out; we had not made up our minds about which way we were going to jump; my parents had decided to go on an extended holiday for four months overseas, and so the decision is made for us as we were asked to housesit for them. We did not have much furniture, and my parents had a large downstairs room we could live in, and we had a toilet and shower to use next to the room. My parents had prepaid all their bills, so we do not have any to pay them. We were provided a place to live rent-free while they were away and for a couple of months when they returned home.

 

When we moved out of my parents' house, we found a unit to rent for a year in Meadowbank. During that year and the time, we spent at my parents' house before that, we saved up enough money to deposit on another unit in Meadowbank. We paid off a small personal loan and bought the unit. We exited the rental market and entered a mortgaged unit we owned.

 

When we had been married for six years, and our parents asked us when we would give them grandchildren, we had not even thought about having children as we had been too busy with work, holidays and looking after my younger brother Christopher on many occasions. We decided to try to have a child. It only took six weeks for Jackie to fall pregnant after being on the pill for eight years, and she carried Michelle to full term. Michelle was born with the aid of forceps as she was not positioned right for the birth, and then the birth went smoothly because of the skill of the doctor and the use of the forceps.

 

When we realised, before Michelle was born, how difficult it would be to bring up a baby in a top-floor unit without a laundry and that disposable nappies were not around, we decided to sell the unit and buy a house. Still, we must first find a buyer for the unit and a house to live in. The unit was sold on the day it was listed, and the house hunt began. We found a house to buy and moved in before our daughter was born. That is God who found us the buyer so quickly, and even though we looked at many houses, we found one to buy at the right time, so we were able to move into the house on the same day that the unit sale was finalised when the new owners took possession of the unit.

 

When we were shopping at Blacktown Westpoint, Michelle was a year old, so we had a trolley, a pram, and a package to get out of the lift. We pushed the pram out first, and then both Jackie and I went back into the lift to get the rest. The lift door shuts on us, and the lift starts moving up to the next floor, leaving Michelle alone in her pram on the floor we just came from. We hurried down to that floor after the lift stopped higher up and found the pram surrounded by several elderly ladies, all wondering where the mother was. Michelle was not alone; she had got the ladies' attention and was not taken away by anyone or abducted.

 

When I hit a semi-trailer, I got a written-off car as the whole front of the car, from both front doors to the front bumper bar, was damaged as I had lost control of the vehicle on a wet road, and we were headed for a telegraph pole. I slid across three lanes of the road without being in control of the car, but we hit the truck instead and were pushed by the impact back into the lane we started instead of the telegraph pole being wrapped around the pole. The car got written off by the insurance company. Nothing happened to me; my wife Jackie got whiplash and got over it successfully, and our two-year-old daughter Michelle got the imprint of the buckle from her safety child car seat on her stomach. The insurance company replaces the child's car seat, but she is okay.

 

Years later than the accident, we have a second child, Marcus, who would not have been born if we had perished in the crash, and decades later than that, I realise how fortunate we were to have survived the crash as we would not have had Marcus if we had died. He would never have existed, for he had not even been conceived then. The truck was in the right place at the right time to stop us from hitting the telegraph pole.

 

When we tried for another child, months went on, and we lost heart and thought it was never going to happen, and it did not; we stopped actively trying for a child, and then Jackie fell pregnant after we had given up trying for one. We got a second child.

 

When my youngest child, Marcus, was three years old, my wife Jackie was doing housework, and she was home alone with Marcus that day when she heard an audible voice inside her room. It was spoken out aloud, and no one was there, and the voice was telling her to go and check on Marcus. She went out the front of the house to look for him, and he was on the road. She gathers him and takes him back inside, and he is safe from any potential harm from any vehicle on the road.

 

When we were on holiday in Dubbo, and we were all in a large op-shop, and our four-year-old son, Marcus, went off by himself, which he usually does in a store, but usually, he stays in any store that we’re in, but this time he leaves the store, and we did not know that he had left the store. My wife, daughter, and I looked for him, but he was not in the store. So, we left the store and turned to the left, not the right, although we had no idea which way he went, and we started walking away from the store. Then, we met up with a man and his wife walking toward us. He is holding Marcus high up in his arms, and Marcus is safe; the man says he picked up Marcus as Marcus was crossing a road by himself at the pedestrian crossing, and it did not look right to the man, as Marcus was not walking with any parents. So, he picked up Marcus and backtracked with Marcus to see if he could find us. He did find us, and we were reunited with our son.

 

When we were on holiday driving back from Melbourne to Sydney, our children were young, and we were at a roadside rest stop with a toilet. Our older child Michelle wanted to go to the off she went by herself. To my horror, I realised it was a pit toilet. I told my wife Jackie to run after our daughter, and my wife got there and managed to save our daughter from disappearing into the pit of poo and wee that was below the toilet seat because the toilet is made for adult bottoms, not smaller children’s bottoms. Fortunately, our child had left the toilet door open so Jackie could grab her before she disappeared into the pit below her. Michelle almost fell in, and she would have drowned in the pit if she had fallen in.

 

When we were so broke that all we could afford to eat was sausages and potato mash for weeks, we fed our family; my wife, Jackie, talked to some of the ladies at the church we were going to She spoke of how hard we were finding it financially, and someone we never found out who did it put an envelope in the offering tray with our name on it, and it had $100 in notes. In the nineties, $100 was considered a substantial amount of money. One of the church’s elders gave us the envelope containing the money. We were at our lowest financial point.

 

After leaving that church, as Marcus was a bit too much for them, he was the only special needs child in the church, and Marcus had behavioural issues. We started going to another church where Marcus was accepted for who he was. Jackie and I went through the waters of an adult baptism. We found a new church suitable for Marcus and for us to acknowledge God as our Lord through an adult baptism.

 

When I was on holiday with my family in Melbourne, on yet another holiday in Melbourne, and we were lost and parked on the side of the road, a truck came over the hill from behind us and hit our car. Still, all that was hit was our driver's door exterior mirror, the only part of the car that broke. It could have been a lot worse if the truck had been a little bit closer to us, as our car would have been pushed forward violently from behind by the truck. It would have been a bad accident, potentially a fatal one.

 

When I was on that holiday to Melbourne with my family, we were on a bus the day we left the car for the mirror repair. We were having difficulty settling Marcus, and a lady came over and prayed for my family and me Marcus settled down. We needed that intercessory prayer. She said that God told her to pray for us, so she did.

 

When my wife Jackie had a series of mini-strokes, and we already had two children, we were told that she had to go off the pill right then and that I would need a vasectomy as an operation to tie her tubes would have been too dangerous for Jackie to have as would another pregnancy and childbirth as she could die from either the operation, or from pregnancy or giving birth and so I went ahead with getting the vasectomy, and we had counselling. I wanted to keep Jackie safe, alive, and well, and we made the right decision about me getting the vasectomy. I got to keep my wife safe by getting the vasectomy and enabling Jackie to be still alive. Otherwise, I would have become a widower with small children.

 

After experiencing chest pain for a long time, months, and months, in mid-1999, I visited a doctor at the recommendation of my wife. X-rays, ultrasounds, and a biopsy showed that my thyroid gland had significantly enlarged and extended deep down into my chest cavity. It was pushing my oesophagus, windpipe out of the way, and my other organs.  If it were not for my wife getting me to see the doctor, I would have died once the windpipe had fully closed because I could live without food for a while if my oesophagus had closed, but I cannot live without air if my windpipe had closed. Getting a hole put in my neck to use for breathing would not have worked for breathing as the windpipe and oesophagus were much lower down in my chest cavity where they were being squished. The surgeon was able to remove the thyroid through my neck as he was thinking at first of cracking open my ribcage to get at the thyroid from below it as it was deep, far down into my chest cavity, which would have had more risks and a more complicated period of recovery. Still, he was able to remove the thyroid through my neck and hide the scar in a skin fold. I got through the entire process of getting the medical and surgical help I needed.

 

When I was awaiting a phone call to find out if my thyroid was cancerous as I had had a biopsy and I was at work, a workmate told me that my wife was on the phone for me, and my wife Jackie said, ""There's no cancer"", and right then at that moment I felt two hands on my shoulders from behind me. I turned around to see who had touched me, and nobody was there; the nearest member of staff was three metres in front of me, and it was not her, yet I felt the hands on both of my shoulders; it was a physical touch as I did feel them.

 

When I saw a cat on TV that was twitching and moving while asleep, and it moved so much that it fell off the coffee table that it was lying on, and the commentator said the cat had REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder, I told my wife, “Look, that’s me.” I had been having dreams where I became active while dreaming instead of remaining passive, and I moved around and fell out of bed while fast asleep, which had happened several times. I went to the hospital and saw a sleep specialist, had a sleep study, and got diagnosed with REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder. The sleep doctor started talking about Parkinson’s Disease and my short-term memory issues. I watched a TV program I did not know was on as I was just channel surfing. It got me to make the connection between me and my sleeping behaviour and the cats and this led to a diagnosis of REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder.

 

When I had a shoulder ache, and it had been there for a long time, and I had not seen a doctor as I am a man, for it’ll be right and the church we were attending, had for the first time in the years we had been going there, they have a visiting healer. I got to the front, sat on the chair, and didn't tell the healer what was wrong with me; he didn't ask. I got holy oil on my forehead, was prayed over with the laying on of hands, and returned to my seat. Then I got a burning circle of hotness, red hot, right where my shoulder had been hurting, and after a while, the burning sensation went away, and I realised that the shoulder pain had gone and did not come back.

 

When my eldest child Michelle was getting bullied at high school, and Jackie and I decided to take her out of that school system altogether, we contacted another school. We were nowhere near their catchment area. Yet, they accepted her, and she settled into the new school, and the bullying stopped; she got to make some strong friendships. Later, one of the bullies from the other school starts at our daughter’s new school, and our daughter is OK as she now has a circle of true friends who tell that bully to leave her alone as the bully tried to bully her again and the bullying is nipped in the bud.

 

When our church closed as it was not viable, we joined a new church where we settled, and Marcus was accepted by that church, even though he had special needs. Congregation members had been praying for someone like Marcus to come along, and Marcus went to the new church with us. We got into a new church suitable for all my family.

 

When I enter a competition, many times to win $1000, and the community organisation I nominate in the competition will win $10,000, I pray about it. I nominate our new church, and so on. For every entry, I nominate our new church. I did well over thirty entries. I won $1000, and our new church got the $10,000. The cheques were timely for our new church and us and were needed when the Global Financial Crisis was on.

 

When Marcus is in Year 11, his high school tries to get him to sign himself out, leave the school permanently, and not return for Year 12. It would have been a bad idea as the community participation program he would have done after schooling had finished for him was for special needs people after they finished Year 12, not Year 11. A place was found for him at a dedicated special needs school for Year 12, which he completed. It was the best year of schooling that he ever had. Marcus went to the new school, the best place for him.

 

We renewed our wedding vows on our 30th wedding anniversary, and we did so in front of our church congregation. This time, unlike when we were married, I got to kiss the bride, as I did not get to kiss my bride in our wedding ceremony thirty years before. We publicly show our commitment to each other by renewing one of the important vows possible.

 

When Marcus and I boarded a crowded train full of people, I almost lost hold of him while pulling him into the carriage. I would have left him behind. We kept together as if Marcus had been left alone on the platform; I do not know what would have happened to him.

 

In a thundering thunderstorm, when the wind and the rain were pouring down a lot, the eucalyptus tree in the backyard fell over and landed on top of our house. It was a widow-maker. I was in the bathroom underneath the tree, and I was safe, and Marcus was in the kitchen, and he was safe. Most of the tree's weight was in its trunk, and the trunk was in the backyard, with many branches on top of the house as far as the front main bedroom.

 

When I noticed symptoms that were happening to me, I didn't know what was wrong with me. I saw a neurologist. “You have Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment,” and now I know what I’ve got, I can get help and treatment for it.  Now, my symptoms make sense to me, and the type of Mild Cognitive Impairment that I have doesn’t affect my long-term memory, only short-term memory and some of my power of thought. I got a diagnosis, and what the sleep specialist had talked about so many years before had come true as I ended up with Parkinson’s Disease.

 

My wife Jackie gave me the support and comfort that I needed after being diagnosed with a life-changing diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, and she continues to provide me with the support and comfort over the years before, during and after that diagnosis.

 

I drove through an intersection at 50 km per hour with a stop sign that I did not know was there. I did not think I was in an intersection, and I heard the car horn frantically blasting at me from another car as I should have stopped for them. I did not know they were there until they blasted their horn. I looked through my driver’s window, and all I could see was a car. It was getting closer and closer to us, and both drivers took evasive action, but I did not hit them. I should have stopped for them as they had the right of way. Our car did not roll with the manoeuvre I did, which was to turn the steering wheel hard to the left abruptly and then hard to the right to give us more room between our car and the other car. We missed the other car and the telegraph pole that the other driver thought we would hit after missing her car. She stops near our car, talks to us, and tells us she has her mum and her son in the car. I have my son and my wife, and if I had hit the other car, my family and I and her and her family might have been injured or died, with casualties in both cars. Still, I missed her and the telegraph pole.

 

After missing the car at the stop sign, I decided to stop driving that afternoon once I got home, and shortly after that, my neurologist and my GP forbade me from driving. I know they're both right anyway. I’ve already stopped driving as I know I’m a dangerous driver, driving dangerously on the road. I’m thankful they and I made the right decision to stop driving. I realised my driving days were over and getting me to accept that fact without second thoughts.

 

When I got into the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) on my third attempt at getting accepted into the NDIS, sometimes, God said, ‘Wait.’ Now, I can get the help that I need for my Parkinson's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment from the NDIS. I got in with perfect timing onto the system when I was prepared for it,

 

After my diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, my wife and I decided that as I worsened, as that was likely to happen, she wouldn’t be able to look after Marcus and me, so we made the decision to find Marcus’s accommodation in a supported independent living share house as he’s special needs. A place is found for him, and he loves it. We know that after we die, Marcus will be looked after as he is in the system, and we made the right decision for his short-term and long-term living needs.

 

When I was in the hospital with Septic Shock because of a nasty bacterial infection from a bacteria called Proteus mirabilis, which is found in soil and potting mix, and I was a gardener as a hobby, I got blood poisoning. I was on life support and in a coma for three days and three nights. My heart was enlarged, my kidneys had shut down, a kidney stone blocked one of the ureters from one of my kidneys, I had blood poisoning, both of my lungs had been infected with that nasty bacterium, and I was on dialysis. My brain is in la-la-land as I have delirium, and the delirium persists well after I am brought out of the coma, as the delirium lasts for more than a week. I’m contagious with the bacteria, and I’m in ICU for ten days in a private room as I’m in isolation; visitors must put on disposable clothes, gloves, and a face mask to come into my room and then dispose of the clothing when they leave my room.

 

After the time I spent in the ICU, I was put in the general ward. I come through the whole lot OK without losing a hand or a foot or anything else to sepsis, as many people who end up with sepsis need to have their limbs amputated. As that part of them dies, or they die. For five thousand people a year, for approximately five thousand people die from sepsis in Australia. I got over the delirium, and I still remember the thoughts that I had while delirious. My wife Jackie was there with me for every one of those sixteen days that I was in the hospital, and she had to catch four buses a day to get in to see me and then go home, two each way. I got through sepsis and kept my body intact, and my wife was there every day for me.

 

Before finding out that I had blood poisoning and sepsis, I had pain. I went to the hospital earlier in the week, where they took blood, with the result that they were able to culture it and identify the specific bacteria that had infected me, so they didn’t have to hit it with a broad-spectrum drug and hope for the best but knew exactly what treatment and drug I would need. They stressed how urgent it was that I came back to the hospital for treatment, and I was in the operating theatre that night.

 

When I was getting a regular skin cancer check, the skin cancer specialist found a basal cell carcinoma on my nose that I did not know was there. He can remove all the skin cancer, and it is good that he got it all, as otherwise it would eat down through my nose and get bigger, resulting in complex facial surgery and reconstruction. I did not need a more complicated operation to catch and get rid of the skin cancer in time before it got worse.

 

I went on a cruise with my dad, just the two of us, on the Majestic Princess down to Tasmania from Sydney and back again, and we had a suite. It was just before COVID-19 entered the world when Dad could still get around, even though he was in his eighties, and we had a wonderful time together. We got time together that we usually would not have before he passed away a couple of years later.

 

After visiting my father, who was in a hospital at the time, during the COVID era, I was the one nominated visitor that he could have at the hospital and on my way back to the railway station, I hurried across a road with an active Don't Walk sign flashing on the traffic light crossing. I should not have been crossing the road as the Don't Walk had started flashing, and I fell onto the road in front of a bus. I do not know if the bus driver saw me go down. I was able to pick myself up off the ground and hobble away. I only hurt my elbow, and my shoe came off. Fortunately, the red arrow for the bus stayed red while I was on the crossing. I were still on the ground in front of the bus, if the red arrow had changed, the bus could have started moving right on top of me, running over me while I was on the ground. A woman on the opposite side of the road also called me to see if I was OK.

 

Also, on another day, when we travelled home by bus, I was carrying two shopping bags in each hand. I could not hold the seat next to me or the hand straps hanging down from the ceiling as I did not think of putting the bags down; anyway, there was not enough room in the bus for me to put them down. I tried to keep myself upright, and as the bus moved away from the bus stop, I lost my balance and started to fall onto a mother and her pram that had two babies in it. I was falling, and I could not do anything to stop myself. The pram was getting closer as I fell, and a woman sitting on the seat behind me managed to grab hold of me by my belt near my bottom and my shoulder. She pulled me upright before I landed on top of the two babies and their mum. I am not a light person as I am obese, yet she found the strength to pull me upright and the room in the bus to get to me before it was too late, and then someone offered me their seat after my fall.

 

My father, Bruce, passed away, and we had a funeral for him. Shortly after the funeral, we were allowed into his unit to clear it out, as Mum had passed away several years before Dad. I found out that Dad had kept many of the birthday, Christmas, and Father’s Day cards that we had given him as children, and they were in his bedside cabinet, and I had worn his wedding ring from the day of his death. I was shown how sentimental Dad was, as I did not expect him to be so sappy.

 

When Marcus, our special needs son, decided to leave his group house where he was living and went without telling the staff, and no one went with him, he got on a bus at Baulkham Hills and travelled to Rouse Hill, which was the last stop for the bus, by himself. We were on holiday in Hobart in another state, and the police contacted us; after that call, we could track where Marcus went by using his Opal public transport card, as Marcus knew how to tap on and off his Opal card. Opal allowed us to track his trip movements, and we rang the police and the house staff to tell them both what we had found out from Opal and the house staff. The police found him at Rouse Hill Shopping Centre. They heard him before they saw him, and Marcus talked loudly to himself. They turned around a corner at the shops, and there he was.

Years after my father died, my wife, Jackie, stepped on an old answering machine that we were no longer using as we are on the NBN and a home phone is not needed; it’s on the floor, and a message is on it, and it starts playing, and the message is from my deceased father, recorded by him whilst he was alive. We did not know the message was on it. In the message, my dad tells me not to worry about anything and that he loves me. I now realise that I was meant to hear it when I needed to and recorded it on my computer. Now, I can listen to my dad whenever I need to or want to, even though after listening to him, I realise how much I miss him, and sometimes I am overcome by emotion, for I’m still grieving for him for I have lost a piece of my heart. It has been four years since he died, but I am not going to delete the recording as my dad is on it. It pains me that after Mum died, I was not enough to keep him alive and nor were the rest of my siblings, as all he wanted was to be with Mum. he had lost his will to live, and he had stopped eating, and now he is with Mum. We discovered the phone call when I needed to with the words of comfort on it from Dad, which are helping me in my grieving process.

 

When Jackie passed out and was in a diabetic coma last Mother’s Day at Featherdale Wildlife Park, the 000 operator gave us her full attention. The first aid staff from Featherdale looked after Jackie whilst we were waiting for the ambulance, and the ambulance came. Jackie was not in a coma once they arrived at Featherdale; she was taken to the hospital for observation and admitted to the hospital. As a result of the diabetic coma and hospital admission, Jackie started testing herself for the sugar readings for her diabetes and looking after herself and her diabetes better. Jackie was stirred into action regarding her diabetes.

 

A couple of weeks ago, a stray cat turned up on our doorstep and stayed, and he had no collar and no microchip. Jackie named him Max, and we have fallen in love with him. We got a chance to look after another cat and share our family and our home with him, and we have all fallen in love with Max,

 

In early February 2025, I made a new friend, Patrick, whom I call my little brother from another mother. Although taller than me, he is far younger and a Christian. I told him I only had one person to talk to: my wife, Jackie. Patrick gave me his phone number and said I could call him. Here is to a long friendship with Patrick. I now have a friend I can call when I want to talk to a friend.

 

This year, I am using support workers to take me to medical appointments and for social activities, which is something new for me as I used to spend most of my time at home alone. I’m getting out of the house and interacting with more people than I usually would.

 

In all that has happened to my family and me, God has always been there for us in the good times and the tough times. He has protected us over all the instances where we felt his Glory by God looking after us mentally, spiritually, physically, emotionally, financially, in times of illness and poor health, and in dangerous times on the road. God was always there in every situation, especially the ones that could have resulted in injury or death, for I am not so lucky to have all the things that have happened to me and my family by chance, instead it was all planned.  God gave me a wife, Jackie, who has always been there for me and my children, and for her; I am profoundly grateful to God for eternity long and then some for finding me a wife who loves me, and I love her.

For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Jeremiah 29:11.

Be strong and courageous. Do not fear or be in dread of them, for it is the Lord your God who goes with you. He will not leave you or forsake you. Deuteronomy 31:6.

Fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Isaiah 41:10.

God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Psalm 46:1.

And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. Romans 8:28.

For you have been my help, and in the shadow of your wings I will sing for joy. Psalm 63:7.

Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. Psalm 23:4.

We serve an Awesome God.

We have an Awesome God.

Give all the Glory to God.

(M20)

I will be completely honest in this post and some people may not like my past but it’s understandable I’ve grown.

My parents (F41 M49) have always had a rocky relationships rightfully so. I gave them a bad go of it from the teenage years, Stealing money, sneaking out, in trouble with the law, lying, attitude. Unruly teenage stuff.

My Mom and I especially never saw eye to eye on a lot of things especially as I got older. And part of me was recognizing I was getting older but I also get she wanted structure. She would make me clean everything in the house when I lived with them. Pick up groceries, get her coffee from coffee places because she didn’t want to lift a finger. 

Even though I also worked full time like my parents. They didn’t see it that way. I’d even try to talk to them about it and they would say (at the time) “Oh come you work retail grow a spine” even though I’d work 10am-9pm 5 days a week. Which was a lot and going to school full time. That was there rules.

When I began to argue and start putting my foot down she started charging me 500 dollars a month rent to show me what’s what. Idk where that money went, she never gave it back to me like most parents do. And my mom and dad are upper middle class so idk what they did with it honestly. Their mortgage was 1100 for example so I paid a little less than half of that for a year or so.

As time went on, and we began to clash and I felt as if I had to lie to her about small things, since, it’s not an excuse really cuz lying isn’t good, my parents need everything their way or the highway. EVERYTHING or they’d berate me by calling me idiot, stupid, moron, etc. She’d end up kicking me out in May of last year.

I was actually happy, maybe that would fix my relationship right?

Wrong.

It got worse. Every decision I made or goal I had for the future was looked down upon or classified as “BS” and a “pipe dream” and they didn’t want to hear my goals for the next year or so. Called me an idiot for getting an apartment that costs 1547 a month when in this economy that’s decent. Would judge what I spent money on sometimes.

And more recently I’ve found Faith in God and Christianity and I’ve been better. Back i December I quit my job no notice due to my bad mental health and lack of care from my job, and felt like I had to LIE to my own parents because of straight up worry about what they would say with no backup plans they thought I had a job until I came clean that I didn’t start one until Monday this week. 

She told me she’s taking me off her phone plan, health insurance car insurance and I was like ok, sounds good I want to be more independent.

But my Mom is also not a good person. She lies about finances and gets mad when she’s caught. For example she’s been overcharging me on my phone portion by 80 dollars a month for 3 years after deciphering the bill, and 20 dollars a month for my car insurance. When I confronted her with the bills at her house she got mad and told me I needed to go home.

Again. I am not perfect, none of us humans are. But I feel as when time goes on; and I notice my mistake (although I need to stop lying about stupid small stuff), my mom holds grudges from 7 years ago and uses that against me why she can’t trust me even though I’m a million times better.

Another thing is with my paychecks not lining up, I owed her 548 this month for two months worth of payments. But I told her I needed to focus on a place to live. And she said she didn’t care I should have “thought of that earlier”. Again I know I shouldn’t be late on bills but I learned my lesson. My own mother would rather she get paid even if I were to lose my apartment .

Anyway.

I just need thoughts on this situation. I’ve been told by my sisters and friends and ofc my faith in God, that I need to step back and work on myself get back on my feet and most likely not talk to my parents anymore for the time being.

Again, before anyone comments. I know I’ve got stuff to work on but I’m not the sole reason for this bad relationship. And honestly I don’t want to make this worse so I think it’s best if I take a break.

TL;DR: Me and my parents have stuff we all need to work on but they blame me for our-entire relationship falling apart. Wanting to know how to effectively take a break from communication with them.

I have no interest in going to super touristy places just for photos and I don’t want to be running around all over the place. I highly doubt this will be my only trip to Japan, so I don’t need to try to see everything. 

Some ideas I had for Kyoto was going to the botanical gardens and then maybe going to a performance at the concert hall, Kyoto National Gardens and maybe the Nintendo museum (if you think it’s worth it)

They were being discreet but it was a very tight coffee shop and I genuinely wasn’t trying to listen in but I couldn’t help but overhear. From their conversation I gathered that the student should have been in F1 herself but for whatever reason didn’t progress at the normal rate. She kept saying how passing these exams doesn’t give any indication of whether or not you are a decent doctor (her f1 friend agreed) and she doesn’t want to work for the NHS anyway as she is an international student and she doesn’t give a ffff about the people who live here and just wants to do aesthetics. Honestly listening to her made me feel sad and angry at both her and the F1.

I have a Bachelor's degree in political science and have previously worked in the hospitality industry doing supply chain work, primarily. Back in 2023 I was hired on at a federal agency to anHR adjacent office in an administrative capacity. For context, I have always been legally blind and had always felt despite my years of private sector experience going fed would allow me space to grow professionally.  I was moving from supply chain to something akin to HR.

At this HR-adjacent position I was handling payroll, scheduling, leave requsts, and coordinating teleworking agreements for an office of 100-ish. I was also put in charge of updating emergency management documents. I was also put in charge of weekly PowerPoint presentations. There were a lot of emails at 4:55 saying ""get this done ASAP"". I'm going to just skip over that I was voluntold to look for loose cables/coffee cups to keep the office ""presentable"". I got good performance reviews despite the (to me) overwhelming amount of tasks with zero guidance.. I got the payroll system down in about a month.

Despite the positive PR, the job only lasted 6 months before I was let go. In 2024 I had to undergo two eye surgeris which kept me out of work for most of the year (I kept applying but few wanted to hire a person who can't drive/needs a cane). My self confidence is buoyed by the fact I ran several half marathons post-recovery.. I know I can do the thing if given the opportunity to achieve. 

 I am now working with social services and the one thing they keep telling me is ""don't go for IT/CS, go for an HR job like what you did at the agency""... My caseworker isn't a bad person, but every time they say this I instinctively freeze up. Given that the choices laid before me were HR or call center work for $8/hr (I'm in the south, the pay isn't great) I figured HR might offer more upward mobility.

A couple of questions come to mind: 

How important is it to know Excel for something like a talent acquisition or entry-level HR role? Most of what I've done in the past was manual forms (think for inventory management) or occasionally helping out HR at my old company to calculate hours worked on the year to help folks qualify for health insurance. Nothing terribly complicated, but it's been expressed that to excel in HR I need to know a lot more.

How do I ask for accomodations without torpedoing my candidacy? In general, a screen reader (which I have) and perhaps these days a more flexible schedule accomodation wouold be all I'd ned.. but in times like this I feel even that can be too much of an ask.

Is what I experienced federally typical of private sector HR employment? A near-constant  stream of 5 alarm fires because someone didn't follow regulation and now you the most recent staff member have to clean it up in *chcks notes* under 20 minutes.

Throwaway for reasons.

I met Emma at the gym. She and I always go pretty early and afterwards grab a coffee. We would always bump into each other, smile and sometimes make small talk. Well, one morning she gave me her number. I went to class and then at midday texted her and we set up an evening coffee date. We hit it off immediately and have been seeing a lot of each other over the last couple of months.

Sometimes we just get together to talk at a coffee shop or go for a long walk. This is honestly the happiest I’ve been in a long time. After a couple of weeks of dating, I went to her parent’s house to meet them. They were so nice and told me how much they like me and thought I was great. She came to my parent’s place and my mom put her hands in the air and thanked the deities that I had brought home such a lovely woman. That’s pretty much how I feel. We get along on so many levels and it’s honestly the first time that I’ve been in a relationship that isn’t tense or dramatic or too full of problems. I feel like we’re equals, we share a lot of the decisions and it’s never anyone’s responsibility to decide what we’re eating. So, you can imagine when I find out that there’s this whole side of her she never let me know.

I get a FB message from her mom (didn’t even know she had FB) asking if Emma checks my mail (not really, no), and if I can keep a secret (Yes) and what my address is (no prob). So, I send it to her and no response. A couple of days later, I get a card in the mail which is an invitation for a party. I RSVP and make a veiled excuse why I can see Emma at a specific time. I show up last night at the party at the requested time and her friends and family tell me how great it is I’m “supporting her on this journey” and how she’s so “lucky I am understanding.” WTF?! It becomes clear that it’s a surprise party for something that happened – Emma arrives and she’s all smiles and hugs and tears until she sees me and then it’s a look of pure horror. She gives me the hardest hug I have ever felt and keeps saying “it’ll be okay. I’ll explain.” She and her mom go off and I can see/hear them. Her mom is annoyed that I still don’t know, and Emma keeps saying there’s no good time. They’re gone long enough that people notice. Her uncle makes some comments and I still have no idea what’s going on but there isn’t a dry eye in the room. It’s all about her being strong and how things have changed. Everyone is speaking in metaphors and allegories and won’t say what the hell it is they’re celebrating.

I am so confused and annoyed but there’s tons of food and everyone is being so nice to me that I go with it. Emma and I don’t get a chance to speak until later. She takes me outside and explains everything. She suffered from an eating disorder and heard voices not to eat or to punish herself when she ate. She was in an in-patient psych facility for the better part of 11th grade and for a time in the 12th grade and she would voluntarily take 2 to 3 week periods in the hospital in 12th grade and part of first year of university. Basically, she was in and out of in-patient psych hospitals from 17-20. The party was the 4th anniversary of her final stint in hospital. I know she routinely sees a psychologist and she sees her GP like 4 times a year. She tells me this and it’s just through sobs. I can hardly get a word in edge wise, and it goes from how she didn’t want to tell me but she did but she didn’t know how and she doesn’t hear voices, she’s not dangerous but she did hear voices and she’s not on medicine and manages her disorder through therapy, exercise and stress avoidance and she’s mad at herself for not telling me and wants to just throw herself away but she’s worked so hard. It clearly wasn’t the right time to ask questions or get more details. I just gave her a kiss (which was teary soaked and probably mixed with sweat and snot) and told her it was okay. She asked if I could go with her to her psychologist which would help answer questions/alleviate stress. I agreed.

Honestly, I was really annoyed I found out at a party, I am annoyed that I had to smile and pretend to know what’s going on and tell people how great it all is.

I’ve never dealt with mental illness. I can get “blue” like everyone else, but I am really fortunate that it’s never struck my family. I never had anyone come close to it. I don’t know what to say or how to respond. I don’t even know what to expect at a psychologist appointment, let alone what this all means. I have ZERO experience with this. I’m begging for help. What should I do or say? How does one go from an in-patient in a psych hospital to avoiding the subject with an SO after more than a couple of months of dating. She never had any sort of eating issues – I once shared a bucket of wings with her and the only result is we both had a stomach ache from the hot sauce – she didn’t purge or get weird about it. I really am a total luddite about this. Help?

tl;dr Emma, GF of almost 5 months didn't disclose battles with mental illness and over 8+ months in an in-patient psych hospital. I found out at a party last night and haven't had chance to talk to her. I need help understanding this and going through. How should I talk to her about this? Is the fact she didn't disclose a reason to end this? I really, really like/love this woman.  
  
**REVELANT COMMENTS**

**chrelakru**

>She probably didn’t want to disclose serious information about her past like that until she knew you guys were serious about the relationship and she could trust you with that kind of thing. I’ve never suffered from any type of mental illness or disorders but I can imagine how terrifying it would be for someone knowing all the stigma it has surrounding it. I know that tons of people suffer eating disorders- athletes, models, famous rich people, of course normal everyday citizens as well. It’s probably not something she wanted to tell anyone on their first few dates. Try not to be upset that she didn’t talk to you about it, it’s not like she was hiding that she’s actually married or didn’t tell you she had a child or something like that. Try to be understanding about how telling someone she was in and out of hospitals for that reason probably isn’t her favorite thing to talk about.

>As for her family and the party I don’t know why they would just assume you knew, they definitely should’ve cleared that with her first. If it was a surprise party they still could’ve just asked her if she had talked to you about her past yet or not. I can imagine you’re feeling strange about suddenly finding out like that around all those people and having no clue what was going on.

>If you guys have a good relationship as you’ve described this should be something you can talk about and move on from.

**OOP**

>I don't think her mother was trying to out her or it was some weird sort of rebuke of her daughter but earnestly not thinking I didn't know. I don't know, like I would never have assumed she had ever struggled before finding out. So, in short, I like who she is, which includes time in a hospital, I'm glad I didn't know so I could judge her as she is. But, I feel like that's such an incredibly important factoid that I somehow wasn't given that I feel a bit burned and I can't explain why.

**IGgY\_\_**

>I understand feeling burned. But please consider -- and I mean this in the kindest way possible -- please consider that this is not about you. This is not a ""factoid"" for her, this is a major, life-altering personal struggle around which there are enormous social stigmas. What is the darkest possible secret in your life? When did you feel comfortable disclosing that to her? Was that about her, or was that about your comfort with the subject? Being able to be open about it is part of that personal journey that, again, is not about you. You sound like you were mostly blind-sighted and would like to know how to help, but plenty of people are incredibly shitty about mental illnesses.

>I don't think there are really any bad actors here. She may very well have been planning to tell you, but wasn't ready yet. Her mother should have asked her, should not have decided she *should* be ready, but was trying to be supportive and trying to arrange a nice surprise for her.

>My advice would be, if you really want to be there for her and support her, to take her up on her offer to speak to a psychologist so you can understand how best to be a supportive boyfriend.

**OOP**

>I never thought I'd ever be speaking to a psychologist. This will be a first. Thanks.

Had to wait almost 45 minutes for a coffee one Sunday mid morning because of all the Toasttab orders in the queue. While I understand that online ordering and delivery can afford people who are otherwise unable to be in person the flexibility to have their needs met, this particular cafe (and many others around me) still require the food to be picked up in-person at the shop (there's no delivery), so it seems like that benefit is rendered kinda moot? I also feel like the employees now have to work their asses off to get through so many orders, while ostensibly being paid the same wage, and oftentimes without commensurate upstaffing. Would be curious about whether these online ordering apps (toasttab, clover, chownow etc.) reap part of the tip or does it go directly to the staff. May just be an ""old man yells at passing cloud"" rant, but feels slightly more enshittified?

I've tried it with a grind setting all the way up to 8 in the mokapot, but it always seems to take a long time to start brewing, and I can't get more than 2/3 of the water out before it overheats and starts sputtering. I've also tried adjusting the water level, water temp, and using less grounds. (Using around a 7 - 7.5 setting) But I can't get consistent results.

It’s now getting to be $180/month though and I just feel there has to be something more economical. But the coffee is absolutely delicious.

I’ve been avoiding pouring hot water through plastic, so I got a chemex, and I’ve been trying various things to get it good, but I’m having trouble succeeding. I finally went to a local boutique roaster, and told them chemex and they all knew the grind setting immediately. I tried it, at 1:16 ratio, but it came out too strong (maybe too dark of a roast).

I don’t have my own grinder, but I’m thinking of this next. Seems like people recommend fellow ode 2 (i have a fellow kettle). 

What am I doing wrong? Cometeer has to be brewing it, not like they’re using magic, so do people know how they do it, and is attainable for somebody at home? Esp a solution without plastic?

Sorry if these questions are basic, I’ve been experimenting ratios and coffees and just can’t get it.

At this point, the ode 2 will be cheaper than $180/month so trying to figure out even if I throw $1000 at this problem, is it still attainable? It’d be cheaper than cometeer

Wish me luck 🙏,"You guys, I'm literally so happy rn. I think I'm going to come out and I think it will actually be ok. 

So there's a lot of backstory here but I will summarize it as quickly as possible. And feel free to skip the next 2 *paragraphs*. 

*Essentially, I was raised in a very conservative christian family and while my mom (focusing on her bc she's essentially my bff) has never been a violent and extremely homophobic person, she's made it clear throughout my childhood she thought it was sinful, wrong, a choice, and that if me or my sister was gay, she'd be very unhappy. This led to me remaining closeted for the past 7/8 years and trying to pray the gay away. Long story short, I have been living with fear and depression as a result of not feeling like I could ever be my full authentic self.*

*However, 2024 was where I could see my mom shifting away from conservative view points and being more open minded. She even cut back on homophobic rhetoric and has been respectful of a trans batista at our local coffee shop. It doesn't seem like it should matter but her actually respecting pronouns and treating the lady like a normal person has been a night and day shift compared to my early childhood. And I have also ended my cyclic of self hatred and am happy with being a lesbian. I am confident up until it came to telling my family*

Now the reason I am so excited is because my mom and I were chatting the other day on the way back from getting take-out. We were discussing politics because some information came up on the DOE situation and I was saying how I was unhappy with that and also that I hate Christians cling to trump like he actually cares about Christianity. He doesn't. Its a political tool. And I was going on about how being a Christian and watching people use my religion of love as a means to hurt and oppress people. 

She then changed the conversation a little and said that something has been weighing on her mind. 

She brought up how she had saw a post from a boy around my age who used to go to our youth group (which I haven't been to in over a decade lol so I have no clue who this person is). Essentially in his post he was describing how he was gay and spent a long time trying not to be and all of that. And how he can't keep hiding because the dishonesty and secrecy was making him miserable. And he went on about depression and such. But my mom said it really stuck with her and is making her question a lot of things. Especially when so many churches outright condemn homosexuality and won't allow gay couples. But then they will let people who are remarried attend. And how the church goes out of its way to target gay people but not other things like lying and gossip. 

She also was just starting to question whether being gay was a sin at all. Especially because she sees how churches allowing gay Christians seem to be more like Jesus than those who condemn gay people (in terms of charity and community outreach). And that she's struggling to see how gay marriage ia wrong when they appear no different than heterosexual couples. She said she understand the reasoning behind sexual ethics in the Bible like waiting before marriage and not having affairs but she couldn't understand how being gay was a violation of those things. And unlike other things where she could see consequences (such as unplanned pregnancy, stds, sexual abuse, etc) she couldn't see consequences of a gay couple. 

Throughout this, she kept setting me up to talk by asking me what I thought or how did I feel about two women who were married, etc. (I tried to avoid talking bc I was caught off guard so this whole time I was just cramming tortilla chips in my mouth so I had an excuse to keep silent 😭). I could tell she's definitely was testing to see if I would come out. She's already displayed signs of knowing I'm gay. Historically, it was in a negative way. Then more neutral. But for the first time, it seemed like she wasn't upset by the idea. At least, she didn't seem problematic. I wanted to come out but I was scared. It wasn't how I had planned on coming out (which was via letter so I could get all my thoughts out). And we were about to go on vacation and I just wanted to wait until that passed. When we get back next week, I will come out. All I said then, though, was that I didn't think it was deserving of the persecution that it receives. And that Jesus never even condemned homosexuality, Paul did. And I said I didn't understand why it was a sin when it doesn't violate the command to love your neighbor. But being a bigot does. But I definitely think I pseudo-came out because I revealed that I had way too much knowledge on the theology to not have looked it up at some point. Which I have.

But the conversation ended with her saying that this has gotten her really upset and curious. She's upset that this poor guy tried so hard to pray it away, went to counseling do cure himself, and contemplated taking his own life. And that that was way worse to her than being gay. And she also said she wants to do more research and learn more. Which was a yay for me because with my letter, I bought her a book from the perspective of Christian parents with a gay son. And how they have changed their minds. 

Not to get all religious but it is funny because I was praying to God about not knowing when or how to come out. And that I wished he'd give me a sign. And that I was scared she wouldn't even want to read my book. So this conversation coming up where she basically said she is accepting now and wanting to learn more was very much an answered-prayer moment. I know a lot of you aren't religious but I hope you'll appreciate this happy coincidence!

So yeah, wish me luck! I'm really nervous but in a happy way. I'm mainly just nervous that this is a massive step for me. But happy because I don't feel like I'm going to lose her like I previously feared",4,1741454391.0,LesbianActually,2,1.0,False
1j6lxm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1j6lxm5/5_nights_in_the_kushiro_area/,5 Nights in the Kushiro Area,"I recently spent about 5 nights in the Kushiro area of Eastern Hokkaido. I really enjoyed myself, and here is a brief Trip Report.


Day 1
I flew into Kushiro Airport in the morning, and took the Airport Limo Bus to Akanko Onsen. I had pre booked my bus ticket online, and just needed to show the PDF copy of the ticket. The bus service meets most flights into Kushiro Airport, and will bring you to the various hotels and ryokans in Akanko Onsen.

Upon arriving at my ryokan, I left my bags with them, and proceeded to explore on foot, even though it was snowing lightly . Got to the Ainu Kotan at the edge of “town”, which was mainly a collection of souvenir shops and restaurants selling Ainu cuisine. Bought some souvenirs and then had lunch in one of the restaurants. Had venison rice bowl, which was just okay.

Walked back towards my ryokan, and walked into the shops along the way. By the time I got to my ryokan, Akan Tsuruga Besso Hinanoza, the room was ready. Did my guest registration, and was escorted to my lovely room, which included an in-room onsen bath.

The room was definitely top-tier for a ryokan, and had more amenities than I could ask for.

In the common area, the ryokan had a foot spa, a reading room, a shop, a bar, and a coffee lounge. The also had a communal baths for male and female guests, that were rotated according to timing.

Dinner was at the second floor restaurant, and each guest room had a private room to dine in. Food was fabulous, as would be expected of a top-tier ryokan. Chose to have an early dinner, because I knew that there were fireworks over Lake Akan at 8 pm.

Finished dinner, relaxed in my room, and waited for the fireworks to start. After the fireworks, I went down to the bar for a couple of drinks, before I retired to my room for another soak in the onsen bath before I slept.

Day 2
After the wonderful ryokan breakfast, I packed up and checked out. The snow was heavy on Day 2, so much so that there was hardly any view from my ryokan room before checkout.

The bus to Kushiro calls at the ryokan, before heading to the Akanko Bus Center, where we were asked to disembark to buy our tickets for Kushiro. Snow was heavy as we left Akanko, but started to clear when the bus got to Akan Tanchō no Sato. Lots of travellers disembarked to see the red-crowned cranes, but I wanted to go all the way to Kushiro.

Got to Kushiro Station, and put my luggage at my new hotel, the Hotel Route Inn Kushiro Ekimae, conveniently located just across from both Kushiro Station and the Bus Station.

Went to Washou Ichiba market for lunch and had the Katte don, or seafood rice bowl, where you select your own toppings. Tried a lot of fish local to Kushiro waters, as well as octopus roe.

Then it was off to Uocchi Ramen for their famous ramen. Went for the oyster ramen, even though I was quite full from the Katte don, but the ramen was very good!

After that, I checked-in at my hotel, then went to Kushiro Station to get my 5-Day All-Hokkaido Rail Pass, as well as book my seats for my journey out of Kushiro to Noboribetsu.

Went down to the Entertainment District for dinner. Popped into Robata, a veritable institution in Kushiro. The grand old lady still grilled all the food.

Day 3
After breakfast in the hotel (Japanese-style buffet breakfast), I went to Kushiro Station to await my journey on SL Fuyu-no-Shitsugen, the steam locomotive, that runs between Kushiro and Shibecha during a limited season.

I was thankful to my Japanese friends in Tokyo to have booked tickets for me. I originally thought that I would buy tickets for the journey, when I got to Kushiro, since the Rail Pass would cover the journey. However, such is the demand for tickets that the seats were sold out by the time I arrived in Kushiro.

Riding on the steam locomotive was fun. Everyone was a fan-boy/girl, busy taking pictures and selfies. The train passes through the Kushiro Marsh, a protected area, where you can spot tanchō. The train also stopped at a spot, where there was a tanchō reserve, so we got to see three birds before arriving at Sinbecha.

I just went to the kombini to buy some food at Sinbecha, before waiting for the return trip on the steam locomotive. Got to see the steam engine coupling with the cars. Soon, it was the return journey to Kushiro. There were no tanchō in the reserve that we passed in the morning, but we got to see tanchō in the wild and in flight. Everyone on the train was so excited! We also spotted many deer along the way. Soon we were back at Kushiro Station.

For dinner, I went to Tori Yoshi for some fried chicken. Very reasonably-priced, and freshly fried to order!

Day 4
I took Bus 20 to Tsurumidai to see the tanchō, on the recommendation of the lady at the Tourist Information office at Kushiro Station.

What a lovely location! With about 200 tanchō including some young birds.  Stayed for more than an hour, just watching the birds and taking pictures. It was fabulous to see so many tanchō! Then took the bus back to Kushiro.

Returned to Washou Ichiba, this time to eat crabs and scallops. I chose a live crab, that they promptly weighed and showed me the price. They cooked it after I paid for it, and even cut it up very nicely, so that eating it was very easy. Scallops were barbecued with soy and butter.

I then went to MOO Kushiro Fisherman’s Wharf.  Bought some seafood to send to my Japanese friends, to thank them for helping me buy the tickets for the steam locomotive.

Had an early night, due to a very early start the next day.

Day 5
Took the 5:35 am train out of Kushiro Station bound for Nemuro. Was treated to a spectacular sunrise as we got into Akkeshi. The train passes through a few conservation areas, and we got to see deer and eagles, even some resting on the tracks, before being tooted at by the train driver. I also enjoyed seeing the phenomenon of the frost on barren tree branches catching the early-morning light, causing them to dazzle like fairy lights.

Took the bus from Nemuro Station to Cape Nosappu, the Easternmost point on Hokkaido. That was quite a nice location, complete with a marker to say that it is the Easternmost location (even though there are actually small islands to the East).

On the way back, I also took pictures of Higashi Nemuro Station, the Easternmost train station in Japan. Stopped off at Akkeshi to eat oysters (the town is famous for its oysters), as well as to sample some Akkeshi Whisky. Too bad it was so difficult to buy a bottle or two.

Returned to Kushiro, and then went back to the Entertainment District to Tempura Ryori Sakura. Thanks to Google Maps for guiding me, since that location was in a small alleyway. Lovely restaurant, with some interesting tempura!

And that is basically it. Left the next morning for Noboribetsu. I was glad to have made the trip East. The region is still quite “untouched” by foreign tourists, compared with Central Hokkaido, which made the experience even more special.",1,1741454385.0,JapanTravel,1,1.0,False

1j6ltqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1j6ltqp/fear_of_raising_a_disrespectful_human_being/,Fear of raising a disrespectful human being,"My child is 2.5. I know, he’s basically still a baby. He’s so strong spirited, it’s really frustrating sometimes. 
Recently, he’s started saying “shut up” and “stupid”. I don’t know where he picked those up, I guess it could be from anywhere but that’s not something I say to him. When I tell him no, or stop him from doing something he shouldn’t he calls me stupid or tells me to shut up. It breaks my heartttttttttt. He also tells toys to shut up randomly. I made the mistake of letting him know that those words affect me. My mom suggested I give time out when he says those words…I feel like it was a big mistake. Normally, I go the ignore route with unwanted behavior, and that’s always worked. Now that I’ve royally fudged up by giving time out for mean words then stopping time out feeling it was too harsh, I know I’ve confused him. 
When he says mean words, I tell him “those are mean words, let’s say “silly” or “be quiet please instead”. I’ve been doing that for the last couple weeks and it doesn’t seem to be working. 

Sometimes he’ll tell me to shut up and then immediately ask to watch trash truck. I tell him we don’t get what we want by being mean, he can watch trash truck later. Tantrum, lol. 

He seems to like time out? He asks to go in time out. When he does something he shouldn’t, he tells ME to put him in time out. He doesn’t ever really get time out so it’s confusing to me. 


He kicks just to kick us. You could be sitting on the couch and he’ll just come up onto the couch and start kicking the shit out of you. He got my husband in the balls this morning 🙃

He will not let me brush his teeth. I’ve tried all the tooth brushes and tooth paste, he won’t do it. I’ve tried brushing his teeth while his favorite movie is on, I’ve tried singing and making it fun, he straight up will scream the entire time to the point of almost throwing up and fight it. I try letting him brush his own teeth, he just eats the tooth paste lol I try doing turns with brushing teeth, but he won’t let me have my turn. He just screams no at me. I’ve resorted to wrapping him up in a towel, holding him down and brushing his teeth. It feels so mean and wrong to do that but it’s the only way I can get a tooth brush in his mouth. I feel like it’s like that with EVERYTHING though. He refuses to do so much unless I force it. MOST things you can make it fun and he’ll willingly join it but a lot of the time it’s just fits and force because he just straight up refuses. 

He doesnt get a lot screen time (an hour in the morning) and he’s super active. His behavior is off the walls lately and I feel like he’s needing something that I’m not noticing or am lacking in. Or maybe he’s just two, I don’t know. I’m having a hard time not being frustrated. I cried this morning because I folded all the clothes on the coffee table and while I was making eggs, he threw them all over the living room. It’s my own fault for not immediately putting them away, I know that and I took the gamble..still frustrating though. This week has been really hard in terms of behavior and I’m just struggling. I’m so worried that I’m raising a disrespectful child, and I don’t want thaaaaat. I’m not a spanking parent. I try really hard to use natural consequences, redirection, telling him what to do instead of what not to do, and rarely time outs. I feel like I’m failing as a parent. I always feel like I’m not doing enough. Maybe this is all normal behavior for a 2.5 year old and I’m just overwhelmed. I DO know that some of this is typical toddler behavior, but most of his behavior has me questioning life.

I am trying to beat the sun and get into bed before the first rays of dawn slither through my blinds and confuse my circadian rhythm. The curse of night shift. My nights typically start at nine pm and end by about five in the morning. Always dependent on how sloppy the shift went. Last night was one of those nights. Our patrons I deliver to found out it was my last week and were none to happy to hear about it.  I work for a donut shop, circle of sugar donuts to be exact. Best coffee and maple bars in the county. We even put bacon on some of the maple bars. Our bakers really love to experiment and its one of the reasons we have been in business for so long. My personal favorite is our brown butter cinnamon glazed rings. Those things sell out fast. Don't even get me started about our coffee, but I digress.

Circle of sugar is an great place to work don't get me wrong. I really have enjoyed my time here but I just have to follow my dreams. I will be going to film school next semester in a state far away from this place. I just felt like telling people about the reality of what is going on up here is something I had to do. I am leaving out the specific locations for everyone's safety. I don't want some savvy reddit detectives opening a door their not necessarily prepared to close. Though in all reality if someone dug deep enough they could figure out where the delivery route leads.

I suppose I should start from the beginning to paint a better picture. This was one of those jobs where you heard about it through a friend of a friend. They never placed ads for the position. I learned this was because they wanted someone who could directly vouch for the person applying. The interview was definitely one of the strangest I had ever been through. I showed up early in my best outfit and was greeted by the barista. She had me take a seat and offered me a free which I gratefully took. The front of the store was your typical donut shop. Bright pink boxes, shining polished display glass holding an array of sugared jewels of all shapes and sizes. A tip jar full to the brim. Bright eyed teenagers helping customers who lined out the door. Busy place, a good sign that I had chosen a decent place to work.

""Bill?"" A man in an apron stained with chocolate frosting stood with my resume in is hand.

""Yes Hello sir."" I replied

""Call me Frank, pleasure to meet you Bill lets head back to my office.""

I shook his immense calloused hand trying and failing to match his grip.

The hallway was the first indicator of how strange this job was going to get. Various symbols were painted along the walls in a red color that looked like rust. Circles in circles with zigzag patters and what looked like Hebrew written along the outer rings. Dolls made of flowers and bones hung from certain parts of the ceiling. We passed an opening to the kitchen where several bakers stood around a table working a pile of dough all looking up at me as I passed. I swore the dough looked like it was moving around at first glance.

""Right in here Bill.""

We turned into a small room before I could be sure. It was the size of a small closet and cluttered with papers, empty pink donut boxes still un-assembeled and wrapped in plastic, a wall of security camera monitors and a huge cabinet with two doors closed behind the chair of Franks desk. We both took a seat and went through the typical back and forth of a normal interview. Frank seemed pleased with my responses and sighed deeply before opening a drawer in his desk and pulling out a non de-script bottle of brown liquid.

""Bill would you join me in having a drink?""

I froze, the question making me stutter out ""A drink?""

I wondered if this was some sort of test. As if reading my mind Frank said ""Don't worry this is not a test I just like loosening up a touch with my new hires to get to know them better.""

I nodded, slightly nervous at the prospect. This was beyond odd but I really did want this job. The town I'm in doesn't have a ton of prospects and the pay was the best I had seen in a long time for a simple delivery job.

""Sure why not."" I said smiling in a way that probably communicated my apprehension.

He poured us both a glass and we clinked our glasses before shooting back the harsh liquid. It was whiskey I assumed. It tasted a little watered down but still burned as it made its way to my stomach.

Frank stared at me smiling for an uncomfortable amount of time. I started to think it actually was a test, one which I had failed miserably.

""Bill do me a favor can you hold out your hand for me?""

""What, uh, yeah."" I replied dumb founded before holding my hand out across the desk. Frank reached back in a nook of his clutter desk and retrieved a salt shaker. While maintaining eye contact he began sprinkling salt in my open hand before quickly pulling back as if it would explode. I began to sweat nervously thinking I had made a grave mistake and my prospective employer was a complete nutjob.

After a time he relaxed and said ""Excellent, OK good, you can just toss that down.""

""I'm sorry but that *was* actually all a test and you passed. We can move onto the second part of the interview your doing great Bill.""

I sheepishly dropped the salt and wiped my hands together to get the rest off.

""What kind of test? This is all a little odd sir, with all due respect.""

Frank looked down at my resume skimming through, ""To make sure your human.""

""Human? Do you get a lot of non humans applying for this job?"" I asked in a tone I regretted as soon as it came out of my mouth.

""You would be surprised. Just bear with me a little longer Bill I understand the strangeness of all this but It will make sense as we finish out. If by the end you don't want the job no hard feelings OK?""

I nodded slowly, curious as to where this was actually going.

Frank began a series of rapid fire questions.

Do I believe in the paranormal? Have I ever encountered a non human entity? Do I believe in other dimensions? What is your experience with occult practices?

I guessed I was answering correctly by Franks nods and continuous smile. We finished the questions and Frank leaned back pouring another shot.

""You don't have to have another if you don't want one Bill. It's just jack daniels watered down with holy water nothing to crazy.""

I felt curious to hear what he had to say next but also plotting my escape from this office and out into the safety of my car.

""The job is yours if you want it but I need to explain a few things. You will be assisting the bakers for the first half of your shift, frying and prepping dough. The second half will be delivering orders across and out of town in our truck. We also have a menu which is not available to the public. It caters to a clientele who need certain requirements. Our job is to keep that specific clientele happy in order to keep the public safe. We make and sell donuts here but we are also part of an organization. One which has been around for as longer than I can tell you. We help to keep the shadows satiated so to speak. Now I understand this is a lot but I can guarantee this is all very real. As I said the job is yours if you are still interested but I cant go into much more detail unless you take the position. So what do you say Bill, is this something you are interested in?""

I sat under the weight of what he had just said. I didn't feel as though he were lying. His confidence and casual manner of speaking about it all made me believe him. It was all weird but if I am being honest this was the most interesting thing I had ever come across in our boring little sleepy town. I wanted to know more, even if it all was a huge hoax my curiosity was peaked, and there was something I just really liked about Frank.

""I accept the position.""

Frank grinned ear to ear reaching out his massive hand. We shook and hammered out the details for when exactly I would start.

Frank explained ""I will be the one to train you on the routes and our head baker Charlene will train you on the baking and prep.""

""Can you explain more about the whole shadowy organization menu thing, I mean that is a lot right?""

Frank laughed nodding ""Yes I will get more down to the nitty gritty on your first night. It would be better if we discussed it when you meet Charlene and get out on the route.""

With that I took the job. I'm going to stop here guys as the sun is definitely starting to come up and I am exhausted. I will write in more soon here. It is nice to get this all out finally. Have a good one guys thanks for reading.",4,1741453860.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I went to college in Charleston and then moved back about 4 years ago. 

While I’ll always love Charleston, I feel like when I live there I’m backsliding and feel stagnant. I’ve also had some things happen personally that it’s just feeling like I need to move on and away from the past. Plus, it’s a hard place to build genuine relationships, there’s SO MANY tourists all the time, and it’s changed so much in the past couple years. 

I work in accounting, as an auditor, and I’m wanting to move into an industry role. 

My wishlist (I know I can’t have everything, but I want it haha):

• somewhere walkable
• an artsy vibe - when I say this I want somewhere with the possibility of pottery or painting classes or something along those lines
• I know dating sucks everywhere but I’m single and want to be somewhere that’s it’s a little less awful, if that’s a thing 
• somewhere with cute coffee shops
• friendly people, who’d wanna be my friend, looking to build relationships 
• I want somewhere relatively safe
• maybe close to other great towns for a day/weekend trip

If you know of anywhere that has any of these aspects or somewhere you’d recommend please let me know, I’m really stumped right now. I also have zero desire to go to FL or GA.

My name is Matthias, I haven't seen my friend Derek after he watched that god-damn Pibby video, we played TF2, and now, I'm alone, alone like a child lost in a megastore, but this one is a headache, this one is....horrifying

It all started when I had a fine day at school, I would go home and tell my mom about my day, I had to wear my house shoes and head off to my room, I have to check my Steam account, my Steam username is WoNofaKind, For some reason, I play TF2, a lot, and then, I hop on to playing TF2 and relax at the opening logos, After that, I go on a Casual server and play King Of The Hill, that's my favorite mode of all time, I have only selected one and that one is Highpass, ""Game on"" I said, As I wait for the game to play, I managed to look back at the window just to curve my emotions and then I looked back at my computer greeted by the team selection screen

I clicked BLU and I have to choose a mercenary, Pyro? No, Heavy? No, Soldier? YES, that one, I clicked Soldier and a few players have joined and assigned to separate teams, I checked at the scoreboard, 12 players on RED team, and 12 players on BLU team, I met a few players on my side, passthebread as the Scout, Sphinx Lightning as the Spy and MechanicalMinds as the Sniper, As the match started, I blasted the RED Engineer (A.K.A. Done Before Dead)'s sentry and the dispenser, Killed the RED Spy (A.K.A. 02xflo31) with the Panic Attack and Helped a BLU Heavy (A.K.A. Papa Heavy) kill the RED Medic (A.K.A. MEGAN!) healing a red Pyro (A.K.A. BBStotch), As I captured the point, The RED Demoman (A.K.A. Gary Tuck) was behind me, Instead of killing me, He typed in the chat  
Gary Tuck: She's Coming,  
WoNofaKind: who's coming?  
I typed in chat, but the RED Demoman ran off just to kill another BLU Spy (A.K.A. Mr. Freeze)

I shrugged off, ""That Demoman's a bastard"" I said, No female would ever join a game like that, 2 minutes has passed by and Another RED Medic (A.K.A. Peer2Peer) is healing 2 RED Snipers (A.K.A. anticopy and Casablanca), I have to blast them and a RED Heavy (A.K.A. frame13245) started beating me up with the Gloves Of Running Urgently, My health is at 35, So I pressed E and a BLU Medic (A.K.A. KasKasKas) healed me

After the Medic healed me, The RED Team captured the point starting their countdown, The BLU team is at 15 seconds, So I had to fight back, Killing several RED Scouts (A.K.A. IWillEatYourMattress and lucawsmade) and blasted a RED Soldier (A.K.A. zentour), The capture point was captured back by the BLU team and thus starting back the countdown, ""Mission ends in 10 Seconds!"", The Administrator shouted as Another BLU Scout (A.K.A. kmarc150) killed a RED Demoman, With the 5 seconds remaining, I blasted into the air and killed a RED Pyro with the Disciplinary Action and then, We won

The RED team lost and the BLU team had won

BitchAssPlayer: WE WON!  
TheAdventuresOf2FORT (Voice chat): We made a perfect team  
WoNofaKind: Another match tomorrow?  
GrunkleStunkle: Yeah  
Chris Kehlenbeck: See you tomorrow

I disconnected the game, turned off my computer and went to bed, Little did I know is that the following days would go worse, Cause something....... invaded the game

January 14th 2025

Tuesday would start just like any other day, my little sister squealing ""I DON'T WANNA GO TO SCHOOL!"", and my mom responds her with a different response, This thing repeats every single week, I would have to go to school so I don't have to be annoyed by my sister

At school, Before classes start, I have to go to my bathroom to comb my hair, Just as I comb my hair, My reflection..... It became my Soldier loadout, I shaked my head only for my reflection to be back to normal, Was this a hallucination? Am I dreaming? Whatever that was, I washed my hands and then left the bathroom

Class started and my teacher is learning about the Solar System, There would be an assignment at the end of the lesson, I looked at my hands on the desk only for it to be Soldier hands, I screamed causing the confusion of the students and my teacher, I took a breath and the lesson continued, After the lesson, my teacher handed out our assignments and just as he gave me my assignment, I looked at the window and, It's snowing, ""Snow day?"" I said and all of the students came to watch the snow and now, School's closed

My mom came to pick me up and sent home, No homework, no problems, A perfect day for me, my sister got in trouble for beating 2 students up and my mom sent her to military school, Without my sister, I could play TF2 in peace

I played KOTH on Highpass in a casual server, I picked RED, chose Soldier and wait for the match to start, before the match started, A player named ""PosBer"" typed on chat  
PosBer: They breathe in silence, She stole their voices  
WoNofaKind: What are you talking about?  
I typed in chat  
PosBer: Nothing, just saying unusual stuff  
He typed back

Who is this ""she""?, The Administrator? Why would she steal their voices? I shrugged back, And then, the match started, The BLU spies are guarding the capture point, So I use The Panic Attack to kill them, after the capture point was captured by me, the BLU spies typed in chat  
I Spy!: Leave  
FrontierSpy: Before she gets you  
WoNofaKind: you 2 are idiots  
I typed, They must be joking, When it reached to 10 seconds, I blasted the BLU player that tried to capture the point and, The RED Team won, As I claimed my victory, I typed in chat

WoNofaKind: We did it guys!  
But the players didn't respond, something's off, all of the players turned on me, as another round started, the players disappear, ""This can't be right"" he said, ""Either I'm hallucinating or I'm dreaming, That's it, I'm disconnecting"" I said, I disconnected the game, turned off my computer and went to bed

Tomorrow, I'm going to have so much trouble when I play TF2 again

January 15th 2025

I woke up sweating at 4:30 AM, ""What an awful nightmare!"" I said, It's still snowing outside and my sister is still at military school, My dad said to me ""Why did you woke up early?"", And I responded with ""I had an awful nightmare"", ""Go back to bed"" My dad said, And I went back to bed

I woke up at 6:00 AM, I had to drink coffee to stay awake because I woke up earlier, After I ate my breakfast my mom made, I head to my room and head to the TF2Fantasy Discord server, I typed in chat what happened 2 days before

MatthiasGaming: this happened to me on Monday and Tuesday  
POGGERS????!: Tell me  
MatthiasGaming: On Monday, I played a KOTH match in the Casual server, And when I captured the point, The RED Demoman typed in the chat ""She's Coming"" and I responded ""who's coming?"", He didn't responded my question  
Gary Tuck: You mean me?  
MatthiasGaming: yes, you played as the RED Demoman, And then on Tuesday, a player named PosBer told me that they breathe in silence and she stole their voices, Those 2 BLU Spies guarding point are telling me to leave before she gets me, and when the RED Team won, I claimed my victory but the players didn't respond to me, all players turned on me and then, they disappeared as the another round started  
king Cole MacGrath: bruh, you're joking, right?  
MatthiasGaming: No, I'm not  
Suddenly, I got a ping, It came from the announcements channel, ""For me?"" I said, As I clicked on the channel and there it was, A message that reads, ""Today, we have a funeral to the players we lost during the TF2 attacks, those players are:

and last but not least, PlayerOfTheWind

Stay safe, players!""

""Derek?"" He said, His Steam username is PlayerOfTheWind, That must be his friend, It must be him, He went missing after he watched the Pibby video, there must be some connection here, but how?, He must play TF2 to find out but first, He must go with someone in the Discord server, I picked one person I knew on Monday, Gary Tuck, I typed in the general channel  
MatthiasGaming: Gary Tuck, Can you join me to investigate? We could go to Highpass on KOTH  
Gary Tuck: Ok, please tell me if you see or hear any abnormal here

Gary Tuck and I have joined TF2, we headed to Highpass on KOTH, Gary Tuck picked RED and chose Demoman, I picked BLU and chose Soldier, And we have to wait until the match started

Gary Tuck: I'm feeling a little too easy here  
WoNofaKind: Who ever is this ""she"" must be down  
The match started, We can't capture the point because we're investigating the whole map here, And then one thing that caught my attention, the box near the capture point

WoNofaKind: Gary, come here, there's something written on the box here  
Gary Tuck: All right, I'm heading  
Gary reached the box that I was talking about  
WoNofaKind: It says ""WBRB"", what does it mean?  
Gary Tuck: I did some research here and it stands for ""We'll Be Right Back"", What's more disturbing is that the phrase was connected to the infamous cable service called TeleBlue, It was infamous for the anomalies, The FBI forced MacNeil Tech to shut it down after the disturbing ""Dawn Is Your Enemy"" broadcast happened in 2011  
WoNofaKind: My friend Derek went missing after he watched the Pibby video  
Gary Tuck did some more research, As Gary found more clues, He came to a shocking conclusion  
Gary Tuck: THERE'S AN ENTITY HIDING IN THIS GAME!  
WoNofaKind: Oh..... my...… god, This can't happen  
Suddenly, Gary and I heard a Scout scream, It was only two of us but someone joined the server only for him to be screaming, A newbie? A bot that joined it? I have to go on where the scream came from, Gary followed me and what Gary and I saw was shocking

Standing right outside the BLU spawn was a dead faceless BLU Scout, his arms was stretched like a giraffe's neck, his fingers are considerably wide like a skyscraper, covered in a glitchy substance and worst of all, His legs were twisted like Twizzlers

Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
WoNofaKind: WE MUST LEAVE!  
As I clicked disconnect and expected to leave the game, It didn't work  
WoNofaKind: Wait a minute, Why can't I leave? Are you experiencing this, Gary?  
But Gary Tuck didn't said a word, in a second or two, he said the same words  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
WoNofaKind: Dude, are you okay?  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
WoNofaKind: Stop repeating, it makes me very annoyed  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Gary Tuck started to change, His legs are stretching out wide, His fingers are becoming longer, the glitchy substances coming out of him and...…. he became faceless  
WoNofaKind: OH NO, I MUST RUN!  
I started to run away from Gary, those words came to me as I was near the RED spawn  
""THERE IS NO ESCAPE""  
""SHE IS THE ONE WHO DID THIS""  
""DON'T OUTRUN HER""  
Gary is running to get me or something like that, but as Gary is near to getting me, The game crashed

Gary Tuck was...… assimilated, I had to report this to the TF2Fantasy server

MatthiasGaming: Guys, I think you're going to hate this but, Gary Tuck, was attacked  
king Cole MacGrath: Gary, how could you?  
MatthiasGaming: We'll miss him, rest in peace Gary

As I said that in general, all the users have disappeared, Now it's just me and those Discord bots, I typed in the chat  
MatthiasGaming: Ha ha very funny, guys. you all disappeared, what a shame. now I have to live with the bots  
But then, A user that I haven't heard of named ""VAL"" joined in and typed  
VAL: It's not your fault, I can make this better and by the way, We'll Be Right Back  
MatthiasGaming: WHAT?

""Am I doomed?"" I asked, I closed down Discord, turned off the computer and went to bed

This can't get any worse, Can it? No, I won't because...… I'm doomed

January 16th 2025

I woke up, My first thought is ""It stopped snowing, guess it's a school day for me"", When I check the window, It's snowing, ""Why is it still snowing outside?"" I said, Is it a forever snow day for me?, I checked the Weather on the forecast app, It's sunny, Why could it be snowing when it's supposed to be sunny? I have to check what's going on, When I left my apartment room, the people that live in my apartment, they're smiling at me with their eyes widen, That's creepy, even when I leave my apartment, They are looking at me, I have to return to my room, As I head to my room, My parents are doing the same thing as the people that live in my apartment, ""You freaks keep staring at me"" I said, they didn't respond

As I close the door, I must set up a stream on my YouTube channel, I have to title the stream ""Hunting Down The Entity | Team Fortress 2 (LIVE)"", All of my fans gathered here and started commenting so I started recording,  
I have to play TF2 to see if I can avoid the entity that's inside of it, I chose to play on a community server but no one's here so I typed in chat

WoNofaKind: Hello? I smell an idle server here!

I left the community server, I checked the Steam chart of the game,

* 1 player right now.
* 0 24-hour peak.
* 0 all-time peak ???.

Only me in the game, This is very wrong, I head out to play a causal match on KOTH, Just like the community server, no one's there

WoNofaKind: What a silent day here at Highpass  
WoNofaKind: Who ever is hiding here show up!

With a sudden bursting through the door, my mom started to hold my head onto the screen,  
""WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?"" I said, there's no response, just a glitchy scream, My dad is fused to the roof of my room, ""WHAT IS GOING ON?"" As I said that, my parents disappeared, and when I looked at my window, there is a crowd of people making that same face they made when I left my apartment room, I looked back at my computer again and when I looked at the window, they're gone, ""I must be dreaming!"" I said, I pinched myself to see if I'm dreaming, I wasn't dreaming at all, maybe a hallucination?

This must be a hallucination, I must continue the stream, I said to my fans ""I'm still here guys, maybe I-""  
Suddenly, a dozen of 2000 ""players"" joined the game and then automatically assigned to separate teams, I typed in chat  
WoNofaKind: 2001? That breaks the player limit! it's 100!  
The ""players"" didn't leave their spawns, Maybe they're AFK? and then, they started chatting, repeating certain lines

Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD! I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Pingo: LET ME GO!  
Sphinx Lightning: Look out! a Sentry Buster!  
PlayerOfTheWind: We're always friends, Matthias

""I recognized him!"" I said, ""Are you seeing this, chat?"", I typed in  
WoNofaKind: Derek?

They're still not leaving their spawns, As I captured the point, the UI disappeared, all the ""players"" started chatting

Okieboy2008: It's him  
CityVandals (voice chat): Let's get him  
BBStotch: Yeah  
daFadaFa: He's so dead

""Oh no"" I said, I pulled up the Discord app and looked back at the TF2Fantasy server, There, all the users reappeared and are saying the same thing in every channel

king Cole MacGrath: PRAISE HER  
nanomachines, son: PRAISE HER  
POGGERS????!: PRAISE HER  
bogos binted?: PRAISE HER  
I SAW THIS BOAT IN HALF: PRAISE HER  
Dafillas De Mayo: PRAISE HER

MatthiasGaming: stop it  
I typed in the general channel, but they keep repeating it, flooding any channel, as I close down Discord, I have 2 options:

A - Fight back  
B - Give up

I chose A - Fight back, I wielded the Disciplinary Action and typed in chat  
WoNofaKind: Who wants a piece of this? Come and get me!  
One by one, the ""players"" left the spawn and started heading towards me, As they reached the area where the capture point was, They are faceless, covered in a glitchy substance, legs long wide, fingers stretched tall and arms that are twisted, I started a massacre, I blasted 2 RED Spies (DANVsTF2 and Mr. Freeze) with The Black Box, Shot down a BLU Demoman (Chris Kehlenbeck), Hitted a RED Scout (Okieboy2008), Blasted 7 mercenaries, 2 BLU Heavies, 4 RED Medics and 1 BLU Pyro (Papa Heavy, frame13245, Peer2Peer, CityVandals, MEGAN!, KasKasKas and BBStotch) and shot a BLU and a RED Sniper (Casablanca and MechanicalMinds), As I was killing each and one of the ""players"", I heard a voice, causing the ""players"" to stop

""Don't kill them""  
WoNofaKind: Who said that  
I typed in chat, I turned around, It's a 29 year old man wearing a white shirt, a red tie, black pants, black shoes, brown hair and blue eyes, It's Donovan MacNeil II, current CEO of MacNeil Tech, or at least it's him

""What are you doing here?"" I said, The words came out of Soldier (The Class I'm playing with) in the game, What the? Every time I say something, It comes out into my game, I was playing it, and now, I was the video game character

""Why are you killing my...…""  
It shifts back into the form that I can't consider seeing, A mass of the same glitchy substance, The head was a blue or cyan female face, her eyes were hollow and she has no teeth  
""SOLDIERS?"", she yelled at me  
""DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TRIES THEY WANT TO GET RID OF ME? I'M THE VALNESS, I'M IN CONTROL OF CORRUPTING EVERYTHING IN MY WAY!"", Said The VALNESS  
""You...…. you're the one who's hiding in this game"" I said  
""WELL, DUE TO MY ACTIONS, I HAD THE POWER, THE POWER TO PUT YOUR SOUL INTO THIS GAME JUST TO BE PART OF MY ARMY, TELEBLUE IS WHAT I GAVE THE POWER, THE POWER TO CAUSE ANOMALIES, TRAUMATIZING CHILDREN ALL OVER THIS WORLD, WHEN TELEBLUE GOT SHUT DOWN BACK IN 2011, I WAS GONE, AND NOW I CAME BACK TO ATTACK YOU! I'M HER HIGHNESS AND One more thing I would say, We'll be right back""  
Suddenly, the world started to glitch, The POV switched to Third Person, the screen started to glitch, they started chanting in the chat

daFadaFa: PRAISE HER  
GreenFarmer: PRAISE HER  
keg Meg: PRAISE HER  
Sphinx Lightning: PRAISE HER  
Pingo: PRAISE HER

I started screaming, The Soldier's (The Class I'm playing with) body started to change, his face is becoming faceless, the glitchy substances started appearing, fingers started to stretch, legs started to become long and his arms are started to switch, My fans are scared of it, My eyes are becoming hollow, black saliva started to come out of my mouth, I was nonstop screaming, As I was about to die, Mobile Task Force started to raid my room and the real Donovan II came out and said  
""There, that's SCP-VLN5!"", Donovan II pulled the plug of my computer and then taking it away for possible researching on SCP-VLN5, The Mobile Task Force left my room and 2 SCP agents came into my room and then started injecting me with amnestics and then, I started to black out

January 17th 2025

When 2 Paramedics started carrying me on the stretcher, I was awaken by what happened yesterday, I was saved, The apartment was closed down, a news reporter standing out telling a story about ""an apartment shooting"" and Donovan II complaining to Gabe Newell about my YouTube stream, people outside the apartment started gossiping on what happened to me

I was sent to the Hospital and the doctor diagnosed me as fine (still with the hollow eyes and the black saliva), I was in the lobby after the doctor diagnosed me, and then, as I watched the window, there is a bus outside and it's waiting for me, I left the hospital lobby and got on the bus

There wasn't an apartment shooting, They did a cover story about it, As the bus stopped at The Safety Lodge and got off the bus, The owners of The Safety Lodge assigned me to a log cabin, When I entered the log cabin they assigned me, I was excited at my log cabin, a living room with fancy furniture, an LG 4K UHD Smart TV in the living room, A door to the bathroom with the sign attached to it saying ""HOME SWEET HOME"", A door to my room with the note taped to it reading ""Still best friends - Derek"" and a note on the desk in my room, I took off the note that was taped to the door, ""I miss you, Derek"" I said, I had good memories of him, I entered my new room and, there was a computer waiting for me, It had the same layout as the old computer at the apartment but this time, It was an HP All-In-One Computer but there's one thing, Only one thing is replaced, Instead of Team Fortress 2, It was Overwatch

When I checked my Steam page, Team Fortress 2 is gone and Overwatch is waiting for me to be played, ""I never played Overwatch before, I was a TF2 Fan"" I said, As I checked the Discord server, I found out that the TF2Fantasy Discord server was replaced by the OverwatchOverRide Discord server, I checked on the note that was on my desk, It read

""It seems that you survived an SCP-VLN5 attack, With your hollow eyes and the black saliva, I considered you're lucky that you are not dead, I knew this SCP when your streamed show up, your fans will still believe that you are okay, Your new computer is SCP-VLN5 free, so is the TV

To yours - Donovan II, CEO Of MacNeil Tech""

No idea what body fat was 5 years ago but best guess is I gained 5-10 lbs of muscle and lost 10-15 lbs of fat between now and then. I’m not the strongest I’ve ever been but am not too far off from those peaks while being a good 15 lbs lighter. This is the lightest I’ve weighed since my teens.

I strength trained on and off throughout my 20s & 30s but dreaded cardio. 5 years ago on my 39th birthday, I got some shirtless pics just because I wanted to remember what I looked like before hitting 40. “Before” pics were not my intention. Here are some things I do that worked for me since then with the occasional shameless subreddit plug related to the thing. Nothing necessarily special about any of these except for 2 habits singled out that I get on a soapbox about.

Food

-When COVID started, working from home got me to shift from 3 meals to 5 to 6 small meals separated by at least 2 hours per day is my stomach’s happy place. Eventually that evolved to me aiming to get 20g to 40g of protein in each meal. The feeling of building up hunger and then eating a big meal to feel really full doesn’t feel good to me anymore.

-I have a daily protein shake with 5g of creatine, whey & pea protein powder, kale, spinach, carrots, flax meal and blueberries or acai. It’s 40g of protein that I count as one of my meals or I may split it up to supplement two other meals to hit my protein window.

-I do eat fast food regularly but never get drinks or fries. A burger, chicken sandwich, nuggets, or breakfast burrito are regular things in my life though.

-I don’t count calories but try to be generally aware of calorie count in various foods doing a little cost/benefit analysis (calorie/enjoyment analysis really) on everything I eat. For example I don’t like bready/sweet/pastries enough relative to its calorie count and rarely eat donuts, cake, cookies, etc but I love myself some ice cream or pie.

-Preachy tip #1: Not (or rarely) drinking calories is a life hack. Not just for calorie control but for my wallet and keeping my fridge minimal. Black coffee and water only, except for my occasional whiskey. Yes I do a daily protein shake but I think of it as food I should be eating ground up to easily consume. After years of living by this, it got me to a point where soda or fruit juice tastes disgusting to me unless it’s heavily watered down.

Habits & Exercise

-Getting into VR games during quarantine, particularly a game called r/pistolwhip, made home cardio actually fun. I still play regularly.

-3 years ago I got a r/whoop fitness tracker. I’m a sucker for gamification and hitting a recommended strain number every day got me to do things like walk faster, shovel snow harder, and play with my kids longer even when I was tired. It tracks sleep and seeing how much even 1 drink wrecks my sleep I went from 1-2 drinks most nights to 1-2 per week. I may switch to a r/garmin in a few months.

-r/peterattia is the one health guru I bought into, at least the exercise part. 2 years ago I read his book Outlive which got me to structure workouts aiming to be a healthy, functional old man one day as opposed to working out for the hell of it.

-I spend about 4-5 hours a week at the gym unless I’m travelling or sick. (~40% strength training, ~40% low zone cardio, ~20% mid/high zone cardio) If someone told me decades ago zone 2 cardio was the best place to spend most of your time in I probably wouldn’t have dreaded it so much.

-Preachy tip #2: Don’t try to fit a strength training cadence into a 7 day week. All I want in life is to avoid putting in more effort for less payoff. I suspect that if a week were increased to 8 or 9 days, most people who hit the same muscle groups 2X or 3X per week would see better results. 4-5 day rest between muscle groups seems to be optimal for me. I won’t pretend to know what’s optimal for everyone but the odds are slim your optimal rest fits into a 7 day week. Even if I’m wrong, I’m fairly confident I’m getting 90+% of the results working out 50%-80% as often as people hitting the same muscle groups multiple times every 7 days.",29,1741453419.0,progresspics,5,1.0,False
1j6lkc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1j6lkc3/norway_round_trip_havila_fjord_cruise_review/,Norway Round Trip Havila Fjord Cruise Review Feb-Mar 2025,"Just got back from a 12 day fjord cruise on the [Havila line](https://www.havilavoyages.com/). Havila is the new kid on the block, challenging [Hurtigruten ](https://www.hurtigruten.com/en-us)for the last couple of years with new ships on the venerable route along the coastline of Norway.

This was our second trip to Norway but our first cruise, so some of what follows may be the result of our inexperience with ship-bound sightseeing. But we are experienced travelers and former expatriates, so I hope our expectations weren't unreasonable.

**The cruise:**

* Bergen to Kirkenes round trip, with stops along the way and excursions for 12 days.
* Price included full board with an exterior upgraded cabin.
* Total price with several excursions and onboard credit for 2 people: $10K.

**+++**

* New ship and a cabin that while small felt bigger than the hotel rooms we stayed in at Bergen.
* Staff were all English speaking and extremely polite, helpful and professional.
* On-board astronomy lectures by a noted astronomer and [science writer Ian Ridpath](http://www.ianridpath.com/).
* Coffee and snacks were high quality.
* $250pp onboard credit which can be used for excursions, snacks, etc.

\- - -

* Limited time at port stops. Very little time to leave the ship and just poke around. Some stops were far away from the town center (Trondheim), leaving no time to explore. For example, city center was 25 mins away, there were no shuttle buses and total port time was 3 hours.
* Port times were approximate, and docking often took 15 minutes after arrival to disembark passengers. Ship then expected passengers to arrive 15 mins early before leaving port - making port visits even shorter once you factored in the late arrival, and the danger of missing the boat by being late.
* Excursions were also relatively short and very expensive compared to those we've taken elsewhere. For example, Dog sledding in Kirkenes cost $300pp, but lasted about 90mins after transport.
* Unclear what was covered by board and what wasn't. Since the ship carried locals from port-to-port, everything on the menus outside of lunch and dinner was priced. It turns out board covered all coffees including fancy ones, but not bottled water or sodas. I expected to pay for pastries and burgers from the snack bar, but didn't. Every food interaction required an Havila voyage issued ID card, but some things made it to the invoice and others didn't.
* Board food was overly complicated with small portions ""to limit food waste"" with the exception of breakfast, which was continental with usual breakfast fare. Choices were limited to about 4 options, including a vegetarian one, and this being Norway, fish was always there. But if you didn't like fish, you were really limited to the snack bar, especially since long stops in towns were few so you couldn't snag a bite at a local restaurant (we did manage it once though).

Biggest problems

* We lived in Japan, the largest consumer of fish in the world per capita, so I consider myself flexible when it comes to eating it - but the fish-centric board made even my wife say after the first week, ""If I ever see salmon again, I'm going to puke."" Well, she put it more politely than that, but you get the gist - oh, and we were served it for breakfast on the plane home. Stockfish, salmon and cod were pretty much it - oily options which may be big in Norway, but nowhere else I've ever visited.
* The round trip voyage we took from Bergen to Kirkenes and back was billed as 12 days, but it was really more like 10. Day 1 was boarding at Bergen, and cabins weren't made available until 18:00.
* Likewise on the return to Bergen, arrival was scheduled at 14:45, but pushed back by an hour to 15:45 - yet we were kicked out of our cabins at 10:00, the usual check out time. There were no excursions scheduled for either day, and on day 12 the shop, snack bar and restaurant all closed early. The bar, which opened at 14:00 didn't open at all. This left people milling around the public areas of the ship with nothing to do.
* Very rough seas and bad weather. This was a once-in-a-lifetime trip meant to see the Northern Lights at solar max during a new moon. We did see the lights early in the trip, but the rest of the trip the weather was awful and the sun was quiet. Quite a few passengers were seasick during the voyage - but that wasn't Havila's fault. I also learned that if you really want to see the Northern Lights, go inland where the weather is better.

Conclusion

Overall it was a good - but costly - experience, and in retrospect I feel that I could have put the money to better use on a less-structured trip to Norway. We like to experience local food and culture at a slower pace, and plan to return to Norway again - just inland, and with a rental car.

I'd be curious to hear from anyone who has taken Hurtigruten, or those who know cruises.",4,1741453393.0,Cruise,2,1.0,False

Around age 11 she put me in charge of clipping coupons (she let me keep the savings) and it really taught me to become a savvy shopper. Back then, it was very common to see one housewife after another at checkout slashing their grocery bill in half as many stores doubled (sometimes tripled) coupons. I also fondly remember my parents taking me to Norm's for the $2 two for two for two breakfast, and it was absolutely packed.

Fast forward to today, I see people routinely waiting in crazy long lines to pay $7, 8, 9 for a cold-brew coffee, a single scoop of artisonal ice cream, or one gourmet donut. Or $15-20 for fast food. I live across the street from a McDonalds. I haven't eaten a meal there in years, but I buy the 99 cent iced coffee through their app almost daily. They always have $5 or $6 meal deals on their app, yet one person after the next is walking up to the cashier and paying $12-15 for a meal. I don't get it.

A couple weeks ago, I ate at a hipster fast-casual restaurant down the street. The sandwiches are excellent, but normally overpriced. $14 ala carte, $7 for waffle fries, $4 for a drink. After tax and tip, you're paying over $30. Well, from 3-6PM they have a DINE-IN ONLY happy hour (food only, they don't serve alcohol) where it's $14 for a sandwich, fries, and drink. During my 30-minute visit, I was the only person who dined-in. They had about a dozen Postmates/Uber Eats orders and a couple people carry out (not HH eligible). But not a single person dined in.

Tldr: having a panic attack one time while performing is making it difficult for me to practice and perform again, scared of it happening a second time or every single time I play, need advice on how to overcome this


I’m a grad student studying performance currently. When I was in my undergrad, I rarely had issues with performance anxiety. I would get a tiny bit jittery, but whenever I would perform in studio class or recitals, I felt like it always went pretty well. I never felt like I had issues with panicking while performing. My foolproof method to tackle any type of potential anxiety was to just be consistent and thorough with preparation and to record myself playing each day. This worked so amazingly for me. Fast forward to now, I felt like my first fall semester in grad school I still handled performing very well, and had no problems in studio class, juries, concerts, etc. Earlier just this week, I played in department wide studio class (all string players as opposed to just cellists for regular studio class) and had a full on panic attack while playing. My bow was shaking so bad and I felt like I couldn’t stop the anxiety. I made it through the piece but I felt so embarrassed, I have never had such bad shakes from panicking and felt so defeated. I literally had to leave the room to cry afterwards and felt like I was going to faint. It definitely took me several days to recover, I felt like I had a bit of an anxiety “hangover“. I even canceled one of my solo performances this week because of it because I was just afraid of that happening again. I don’t understand what I did wrong, I followed my regular routine of being thorough with preparation and recording myself. I didn’t feel like I had any problems with the notes or the music, I felt like I was just shaking so bad that it was distracting from me enjoying my performance. I talked about this with my teacher and we think that what may have happened was I was dehydrated, particularly sleep deprived that day, hadn’t eaten enough, and drank too much coffee prior to the performance. I’ve been trying to do better about monitoring my caffeine intake, staying more hydrated, and keeping snacks with me, but I’m just so terrified to perform again. I’m truly terrified of this happening again and am so embarrassed. I’m debating on canceling my recital this semester because of it. I’m completely heartbroken because I feel like I barely have the motivation to practice now and feel like I failed as a music student. I have no idea how I went from not being scared about playing in studio class to now wanting to panic each time I have a public performance. I have so many performances lined up for this semester and feel overwhelmed at the thought of having to follow through with all of them now. I don’t know what to do and just want to be myself again. Does anyone have any advice for what I may be doing wrong? Should I just push through the anxiety to prove to myself that that was just a particularly bad day for me? I just want to feel the same confidence that I did before this happened.",1,1741452424.0,Cello,5,1.0,False

Thoughts?,"The execution chamber breathed its own kind of weather—a metallic chill, sterile as a scalpel’s kiss, humming with the low, liturgical drone of machinery ordained to deliver endings. Daniel lay cradled in the belly of this indifferent god, leather straps etching their psalms into his wrists, the gurney’s steel a lover’s cold embrace. Light, sharp and surgical, carved his face into a relief map of ravines and weathered stone, each line a tributary tracing back to the hollows of Winston’s roughest streets, to the shotgun shacks and gas station lots where his life had been bartered like loose change.

Silence pooled, thick as clotting blood, before the chaplain emerged—a shadow in black cloth, his gait the measured shuffle of a man who carried final breaths like beads on a rosary. His eyes, twin wicks of borrowed calm, met Daniel’s. 

No savior, this man, but a ferryman; his voice a creek-worn stone, smooth and ancient. “Danny, may you find mercy and grace in these final moments,” he murmured, not to the dying man, but to the air between them, already heavy with the scent of iodine and unshed tears. “May your soul find peace beyond this life.”

Daniel’s gaze, dull as a gutted lantern, flickered. In the chaplain’s face, he glimpsed the ghost of a teacher who’d once slipped him a bag of pretzels, of a truck-stop waitress who’d refilled his coffee six times and called him *baby*—small salvations that had bloomed, thorny and brief, in the fissures of his unraveling. The chaplain’s words pooled in him, not balm but brine, stinging the raw places where hope had long since scarred over.

“You are not alone in this journey,” the chaplain whispered, palm hovering above Daniel’s shoulder, close enough to feel the fevered tremor of his skin. “The weight of your past may be heavy, but there is always hope for redemption. May you find peace in the love and mercy that transcends this world.” 

Around them, the witnesses shifted—lawmen with jaws set like tombstones, nurses whose fingers itched for the sanctity of procedure. They, too, were caught in the draft of this reckoning, their breaths held as if the room might collapse into the fault line between justice and hunger, between the man and the thing done in his name.

Daniel closed his eyes. Not to pray, but to let the dark fold him into its familiar grip—the same dark that had crouched in the corners of his childhood bedroom, that had dogged his steps through Winston-Salem’s graffitied alleys, where the KEEP OUT signs sang their siren song to a boy already half-ghost. The chaplain’s voice ebbed, a tide retreating, and in its wake rose the memory of creek water slipping over stones, of an adoptive mother’s nicotine hum as she rocked him, *hush now, hush*, long before the state came carving her away.

When the chaplain withdrew, the chamber sighed—a machine’s exhalation, a plunger’s descent. Daniel’s chest rose once, twice, as if to cradle the last dregs of air. Somewhere beyond the prison’s bone-white walls, a semi truck downshifted on Highway 52, and a stray dog nosed through a Burger King bag, and the wind, as it always did, swept the red clay clean of footprints.

\*\*\*\*\*

Inside him, the storm had no name. It was not wind or rain but a howling thing, all teeth and talons, gnawing at the cage of his ribs. His heart—a mallet on rotted wood—pounded its dirge. Leather straps sang their old hymns against his wrists, a chorus he’d known since the first foster father pinned him to a mattress thick with piss stains. Breath came thin, a sparrow’s wing fluttering in a fist.

Memories rose like swamp gas. Not pictures, but *textures*: the starch of a social worker’s blouse as she led him from a trailer park strewn with beer cans and broken TVs; the sour-milk stench of group home pillows; the wet crack of a belt on flesh—his or another boy’s, it hardly mattered. Faces blurred into a single sneer, voices into a drone of *troubled* and *unfit* and *damaged goods*. He saw his child-self curled in closet dark, counting roaches on the baseboard, each one a bead on the abacus of his worth.

The storm shifted. Now he was twelve, shoved into a room with boys whose eyes gleamed feral as raccoons’. Their laughter, sharp as shivs, peeled away pieces of him—a stolen shoe here, a split lip there. Nights, he’d press his ear to the wall, listening for the groan of a car on gravel, the slam that might mean a new father, a fresh hell. 

No one came. Only the ache in his knuckles, the taste of blood where he’d bitten his cheek to mute the crying.

Winston-Salem emerged in fragments: Burke Street’s neon sores, alleyways where men traded pills in Pop-Tart wrappers. He’d walked those asphalt veins with a switchblade’s weight in his pocket, its grip worn smooth by hands who’d held it before—a relic of a criminal past. The diner where he’d scrounged fries from sticky plates left by truckers. The night he split a man’s brow with a pool cue, not for money or pride, but to feel the *thud* that proved he could still leave a mark on the world.

Regret, when it came, was not a blade but a burr—small, persistent, working its way deeper with each heartbeat. The woman he’d pistol-whipped outside a pawn shop, her dentures skittering across concrete like ivory dice. The girlfriend who’d lent him a couch, only to wake to Daniel rifling through her purse. Claire Whitaker’s face in the courtroom, that flicker of pity she’d quickly masked with a lawyer’s steel.

Now, strapped down, he felt the storm wane.

Faces beyond the glass dissolved into smudges—a Rorschach test of his making. The chaplain’s lips moved, shaping words drowned by the roar of a long-ago freight train. He thought of the feral cat he’d fed behind the Food Lion, how it had arched its back at his touch, all hiss and hunger. Kindred.

Darkness pooled at the edges. Not peace, but the numb surrender of a barnacle pried from rock. Somewhere, a child’s laughter spiraled—his own, maybe, from before the state’s paperwork buried him. Before the men with their rules and rulers, their *say sorry, boy, say it like you mean it*. The gurney’s chill seeped into bone. He wanted to laugh at the joke of it all: that his life’s sum total was this sterile room, this needle, these strangers holding clipboards like judgment scrolls.",0,1741452304.0,writers,4,0.5,False

I've tried eating but honestly feel like I will vomit if i eat when I first get up.

1j6l4mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1j6l4mc/will_i_be_out_of_place_in_lakeview_at_37/,Will I be out of place in Lakeview at 37?,"I'm moving to Chicago this summer and looking at neighborhoods. I love everything I hear about Lakeview, as it seems to fit my lifestyle very well -- easy to walk to grocery stores, gyms, and coffee shops, proximity to the lake, proximity to my kind of nightlife (e.g. Smartbar), the streets are full of trees, good access to transit (I'm moving without a car), and it has a reputation for being a good place to meet people and build a social life, which matters to me as a single man who would like to not be single. Seems pretty ideal! 

The only thing I'm worried about is that it has a reputation for being great for *young* transplants, and I don't want to have to constantly be asking myself if strangers I'd like to introduce myself to are actually 12 years younger than me. In my current city I feel as though every time I go out I'm surrounded by 25 year olds, which is a little uncomfortable. I recognize that most people my age are in Lincoln Square with their toddler instead of living my kind of life, and it might be the case that a vibrant social scene will always mean mostly younger people for purely demographic reasons. But I'd like not to feel like the Old Man Of The Neighborhood if possible.

Would I fit in Lakeview or should I look at other neighborhoods?",8,1741452217.0,AskChicago,36,0.75,False

1j6l20n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6l20n,Interesting find today,"Submitted for the approval of my fellow Soda Sommeliers: 

I found this at a farm and feed store about an hour east of St Louis today. 

Fitz’s, as some of you may already  know, is  a long-time St Louis staple. Kaldi’s is a local coffee roaster with several stores throughout the region, and I really like most of their beans. Their ‘Natural High’ blend is my daily driver I use to make coffee at school. 

As far as the taste…I bought this more as a novelty, expecting it to be gross. Coke Blak way back when was atrocious, IMO, and other coffee sodas/colas I’ve had over the years were equally underwhelming. And I LOVE coffee, and usually drink it black. So it’s not like I was unprepared for how they would taste.

Anyway…this one is surprisingly good! It tastes like a Coke mixed with sweet black coffee, but not over powering, and none of the bitter flavor notes you get with coffee. That’s been my issue with other coffee sodas…They all tasted like day-old cold coffee mixed with cola. Or they had a weird chemical taste from the artificial flavors. 

But this one isn’t bad. If you happen across it (and like coffee and colas lol) I’d suggest giving it a try!",7,1741452024.0,Soda,0,0.9,False
1j6l1yl,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaMarzocco/comments/1j6l1yl/advice_for_a_new_linea_mini_r_owner/,Advice for a New Linea Mini R Owner,"Hi,

I just received my long-awaited Linea Mini R a few days ago! Overall, I’m really happy with it, but I’d love some advice on a few things:

1. **Factory Pressure Setting** – Out of the box, my machine is set to **9.5 bar while brewing**. Is this the **group head pressure or the pump pressure**? I’ve heard that on some machines, if you want **9 bar at the group head, the pressure gauge should read \~9.5 bar**. Does this also apply to the Linea Mini R?

2. **Flow Rate** – I measured **238g/30s**, while La Marzocco states **250g/30s**. Is a **5% variance within the acceptable range**?

3. **Steam Knob Control** – Do you **fully open the steam knob immediately**, or is it better to **start slowly and then turn it all the way**?

4. **Gasket & Shower Screen Upgrade** – Is it worth upgrading to a **Cafelat gasket and IMS shower screen**, or should I **stick with the stock parts until replacement is necessary**?

5. **Post-Paddle Drip** – After turning the **paddle off**, my Linea Mini R still releases about **5ml of coffee**. Do you **stop the shot 5ml before your target yield**, or do you **turn the paddle off at the exact yield and quickly remove the cup**?",1,1741452020.0,LaMarzocco,4,0.67,False

1j6kzub,https://www.reddit.com/r/WEEDS/comments/1j6kzub/why_is_everyone_so_attracted_to_the_manipulative/,why is everyone so attracted to the manipulative bitch nancy botwin,"i hate nancy botwin with a passion and skip most scenes with her. at the beginning i like her and only hated her drinking coffee while making uwu face but now i am in season 6 and she is a serious adrenaline junkie turned the sweet kid shane into psychopath. i dont think any of her actions are justified, you can deal drugs thats fine but dont pull everyone into a black hole that is you, to be fair i like that all the shits she pull make for entertaining tv just fyi i hate walter white too 

nancy botwin is so starved for male attention it doest matter if its a drug cartel member, her brother in law or even her son she just wants to be seen cool she despises any women in her life and removes the with enough force they run away from her

1j6kz3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1j6kz3b/need_help/,Need help !,"coffee seems to strong and not pleasant !

I recently switched to grinding my own voffee beans on timemore c3 esp pro and switched to non pressurised basket,
I tried a 14gm in 30gm out

On a above when setting where my machine chocked, the time took around only 18 secs for 30gm output.

I am using a 333ml cup with around 250ml milk and 30gm espresso , But the final result seems to be very very strong with very unpleasant taste , kindoff bit of burnt and very strong .!

What am I doing wrong? I am using all the tools and every thing.

One thing to note here is I got the beans from blinkit but they delivered beans (BT vienna roast ) which were roasted on 21st jan ( too old ) , I just bought it in urgency to test the grinder.

Is that the reason?
Ps help me of what you think might be the reason,

Also If i go coarser the output comes out to be a bit fast.

1j6kx1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j6kx1b/i_m20_want_to_confess_to_my_fwb_m34_but_theres/,I (M20) want to confess to my fwb (M34) but there's more at stake than just a relationship,"Eight months ago, I was finishing up my first year of college, facing my 20s, and panicking that I had achieved nothing beyond taking some classes. The only thing I've ever wanted to do is work in music, which can't be achieved academically. I had no new friends, was living alone in a new city, and, most importantly, knew literally no one in the local scene. I was pessimistic too, I guess, since when I did meet someone in a local band at work one day, I assumed he'd just wanted another body in the room at his shows. 

Obviously, I'm writing this, and we started hooking up. I knew a friends-with-benefits relationship with a lead singer 14 years older than me was perhaps the most laughably predictable mistake; he was on a pedestal the moment I met him and I knew I would lose more sleep over the end of our finite time than he. In general, I have a history of forsaking clear boundaries in favor of feeling loved however precariously, but this time I told myself it was all ok because I'd end up a better person in the end. I reminded myself it'd likely end in us parting ways so I could move on with what I'd learned from him. Only now, I'm also his guitar tech. It's been a huge source of anxiety, knowing if I mess up an already delicate happiness I'd found in him I might also lose the sense of fulfillment he's given me. 

Two days ago, he told me in maybe the most painful way possible things might be ending. After rehearsal he hugged me and said he needed to tell me something. ""I might be seeing someone so we might need to put a hold on our friends with benefits thing."" He continued to talk about how he doesn't know where it'll go, he isn't even really looking for a relationship, how he knows I know how to have fun and should meet more people. ""I'll miss it though,"" he'd said. Miss what, me or my bed? Not once did he let go and when I looked up to maybe step back and collect myself, he kissed me harder and longer than our usual goodbye. Even then, he didn't let go. 

I know I'm probably just 20, enamored by feeling loved by someone I admire. It's just so hard to tell right now between the end of the world and a hard lesson I'll look back on softly years from now.  But all I can think about when I'm trying to fall asleep now are the quick moments in which I could convince myself he's been trying to tell me something this whole time, like soft kisses at the top of my head or meeting his mom or when he came over between errands not to end up in my bed but just have lunch. It's harder now to ignore that while he may have enjoyed just teaching me things and feeling smart, in doing so he had to watch me stumble over progressions be played flawlessly and cook me dinner every time with my ""help."" I'm terrified in trying to not get invested and make the end easier, I completely missed any opportunity to give us more time. 

Tonight at a show will be the last time I see him for a couple weeks whether or not I say something. I want to tell him how I feel because I know it'll kill me pretending I feel nothing when I see him again and again. But what if I say nothing and that's what he'd been waiting for this whole time? What if I lose every other amazing thing he's given me? Would it be a mistake for me to pursue anything real with him to begin with? If I say something I risk losing him and the shows and friends and community I have now, but if I say nothing I'll never know how he felt and it might ruin whatever relationship I have left with him. I just know, at the very least, the person I marry will probably know his name. I'll think of him as I spend the rest of my life pursuing my career and I'll think of him when I make my coffee in the morning with ginger syrup. I want nothing but the best for him, his happiest self, but I don't know how I'll handle seeing it. 

This all feels like a bad 21st century version of Call Me By Your Name. I guess, ultimately, is it better to speak or to die?

^(I've done my best to format and check over everything, but please let me know of any issues, thanks. If I should put this in a different subreddit, please let me know! It was too long for legaladvice, so I put it here? And thank you ahead if you read through all of this and have any answers or comments. Also trigger tags for anyone I guess: violence, emotional abuse, yelling, emotional threats, alcohol abuse, alcoholism, and misuse of veteran status)

**^(Thank you.)**

I'm (24F) writing this on behalf of my mother (51F), about her and my father (65M).

There's probably about to be a really volatile divorce. My mom is kind of just done, and honestly I'm there with her. I've been present for most of the arguments and mom has pretty much told me everything, so I'm just putting everything I know of here.

I'll describe some of the backstory, but for the actual questions I'll leave more info at the bottom.

My mom is a legal immigrant from a different European country. She and I both have a dual citizenship with the US. They met with my father being there with a military job, but my mom still went and got her citizenship herself. They've just had their 30th anniversary last year, which unfortunately, when doing the math, means my mom was just 21 and my father was 35 when they got married (looking at it now I'm kind of sick with this info, but bigger issues at hand and all that I guess). We left and moved to Florida in the United States 13 years ago, and have been here since. My father is now retired (both due to an issue he had at work where he got disciplined for pulling a knife on a coworker, and the multiple back and knee surgeries he has had that were caused by his service.) He has been for about 2, almost 3 years now. It's been getting steadily worse since his retirement, and we believe he is either starting to get dementia or has other mental issues.

For years now I have been slowly noticing all of the issues me and my mom have with him. He's very emotionally distant and abusive to both of us. My mom isn't allowed to get a haircut or color or change her hair in any way unless it's to just upkeep what she has without him yelling at her about it about how he likes blondes and she shouldn't change that. He has kept commenting on both my and my mom's weight for a long time now as well, while he has been nearly 250lbs for years now, and neither of us ever went over 200 (this is mostly me, oops,) but he would tell her to go lose weight while he kept gaining. He would always make her work to get anything from him, any compliment or any conversation, or request. She would have to ask three or more times to get anything done (like mowing the grass or taking out the trash) while she would do pretty much everything else. (For me, he has just always been super distant, and I was never able to have a conversation about anything I cared about with him without him pointing out what I did wrong or what I should have done different, never just a nice statement without being put down for it at the same time.)

After retirement, he has gone through so many hobbies; he keeps ordering things to do things, and then never touches them after. There's a whole workshop in the back that took up most of my parent's shared savings where he stores his hundreds of tools, but then just sits on the couch 90% of the time. It seems like he more enjoys the act of buying and collecting the tools and then using them once and just putting them in drawers after.

\-Most recently he talked to a friend and got reminded that he had toy trains as a child and then went and ordered maybe 1k worth of trains and tracks and kits, and it has sat in the workshop for the past 3 months.

\-Before that, he was online so much so that he got roped into a bitcoin scam and lost about 5k before we were able to convince him that it was a scam. (We had to leave hints around for him to find and ""make his own decision"" because when we directly confronted him he would accuse us of ""ganging up on him and not letting him have any fun. During this time he would throw the times that my mother would spent at her laptop working on her Master's degree into her face, and how he was patient while she spent nearly every hour on her computer while he was busy. He wasn't, he went to work and then sat at home while she worked on her degree and still took care of the house.)

\-Two weeks ago he went and bought a 3d printer without ever telling my mother, and then when he wasn't able to figure it out (because of course he's the type of person to never read instructions,) he dragged my friend who has a 3d printer over to help. She spent 4 hours trying to set up the printer for him and then trying to show him how to work it. Her cat had gotten hit by a car the day before, and she was staying home to help him heal his hip. When he dropped her back off at home (she shares a car with someone else and couldn't drive at the time,) he told her she should have just put the cat down. This really upset her, and she was basically crying on the phone with me after, about how much of a jerk he was. (Her cat is getting better, he wasn't mortally wounded or anything, and he's pretty much still a kitten, just 1.5 years old, so a dislocated hip isn't that bad for him. He's doing ok! :D )

This is just.. a recent sample of things, there have been trash cars to fix, tools to woodwork, or other machines that got used once and then just.. sit there. (My least favorite is the CNC machine that he ""got for Christmas for me, and would set up for me"" 4 years ago, that I have pretty much never seen because he wanted it, but had already bought himself a bunch of Christmas presents and wanted to disguise it as something for me. I've never even touched the thing because he went to ""set it up"" and just left it on a shelf somewhere to gather dust after using it maybe once and never showing me. This was.. pretty much my first clue some years ago, and has just stayed with me.)

Some other issues have been the previously mentioned knife incident, where he pulled a pocket knife on a coworker who ""pissed him off,"" and then he lied about it and ended up retiring instead of officially getting fired. I believe he has stated that it was a large flashlight, and the coworker had it out for him. Later, he was bragging to the only sibling that talks to him anymore (he has 7 siblings, and only 1 speaks to him,) that he pulled a knife on the guy and got away with it, but because he was an ""old veteran and the guy was a young jerk"" he was ""scared and the guy had it out for him.""

Another incident was with a neighbor that would walk his dog in the evening with a bright reflector. Apparently it had shone in his eyes multiple evenings and he was tired of being blinded, so he got out of his car and had beaten the man up. When police came to the door afterwards, he stated that he was ""an old veteran"" and that he had gotten out of his car to talk to the guy about shining the light in his eyes when he was driving, and the man had attacked him so he had defended himself and was scared. Later he told my mother that the guy had it coming to him for shining the light in his eyes all the time, so he had punched him and then just kept hitting him and then left him on the street. (Doggo was old, and probably scared :/ so didn't do anything.) I guess the man's parents (who he lived with at the time) had called the police, but when they talked to the guy, he was probably too embarrassed to say anything or something, but the police didn't do anything, and my father got away with his bs once again.

A big event working up the current issue happened a couple of months ago. My parents were both drinking some wine, and they got into a fight. My dad apparently said something that upset my mother, and she went into the kitchen and started breaking some plates that he had gotten her. (I was in my room with headphones on, on call with my bf. I was trying very hard not to listen, because at this point them arguing about some shit he did was normal.) At some point he had called the police on my mother, and claimed that he was a scared veteran, had had to wrestle a weapon from my mother's grip, she was drunk, and he was afraid. After, he had told her that he had called and told them that he was scared for her, because she was saying she was going to hurt herself (he told this to the police that showed up at the house as well, but she claims that he had never said that, because she was right next to him when he made the call.) She got scared and got in her car, and tried to leave. The police had pulled her over and arrested her without question just down the driveway, and never let her talk. The cops that showed up at the door asked me whether I had heard anything, and all I could say was that there was yelling, and then some plates got dropped. When he asked me whether I felt safe in the house before he left, I was scared to say no, because my father was standing next to me, and I knew if I said no, he would just start yelling again. (Small side note, but I think I've basically developed some sort of anxiety response to men yelling, because even if I hear a guy shouting in a store or something, my body will just lock up and start shaking. It sucks, and I'm just so tired of everything.)

My mother ended up spending the weekend in jail (because this happened Saturday night, and they wouldn't release her until Monday). She now has a DUI on her record, when she has never even received a speeding ticket or ran a red light before this. (My father regularly drinks and drives, and either weasels out of it as an ""old veteran with pain"" or just doesn't get caught. Karma where are you, please.) This has affected her life quite harshly (as a DUI should, people should never drink and drive,) but she's paid all her fines and done her time, and still has to live with a sword over her head with him. Any little contact with the law could send her back to jail, no questions asked. She's stressed and depressed, and it's affecting everything. He ended up apologizing and writing a letter to the court that this was a one time accident, and they were a happy couple. He keeps saying he's sorry, but every so often he throws it in her face that she ""decided to drive off and hurt herself, so he had to call the police on her."" When in reality he had called them first and basically painted her out as the bad guy. (I'm aware a DUI is serious. So is my mother, and she accepts that she has done this. It's not about her not taking responsibility, it's about him lying about it.) So the court gave her a 6 moth probation (she is 4 months in right now.)

She has never asked my father for help (other than chores, if even that) with anything large. Ever.  
The only thing with all of this that she has asked him for was to not have alcohol in the house, (because she's not allowed with the probation,) and to please drink less, since all this happened because they were both inebriated. And he just.. doesn't seem to care. We had workers over to put in new windows after a storm caused leaks, and he brought beer and let them drink it in the backyard while they were working. When mom saw, she got upset and requested that he not do that, and to get rid of the bottles properly. He proceeded to get upset about her always harping at him and that he just wanted them to have a good time. Like the random working guys in the backyard were more important than his own wife's safety and health.

This has been hitting her really hard, because she asked him for help with something this important, and he just doesn't seem to care. He keeps saying he will help, and that he is sorry, but he never really does anything to show that.

My mom doesn't really have any friends around, except for her closest friend, but she lives in a different state at least 9 hours away. Anytime she gets to know someone, they eventually end up letting her know that ""her husband is toxic, and they don't really want to talk anymore."" All the time, because he is so mean and ""friendly"" in a mean way, that people just don't want to associate with him, and she's left alone. When we visited her family, she had to basically beg to go have coffee with some old girl friends and coworkers, because he would always complain about being ""left alone with nothing to do."" He always makes it seem like he's doing everything for my mom, how he always takes time ""for her"", that they went to a place ""for her"", that he got that thing ""for her"", when in reality it's always either for him later, or him covering up after upsetting her. He gets her earrings two weeks after her birthday because he forgot her birthday, she had to ask him to come to see her during Valentines' day, and for their 30th wedding anniversary? He just ignored her, and then was apologizing later and got her a bunch of jewelry that she doesn't even like to make up for it. He then kept asking her to put on the earrings and if she liked them or not, even though she was in the middle of cooking. To me, it just seemed like he wanted her to like them so she wouldn't be upset with him anymore, instead of actually caring if she liked what he got her or not. But then he would buy hundreds of dollars worth of tools every other week just because he didn't have that tool yet. But for mom? He would only ever get her anything if she was already upset because he forgot or screwed up something before that, never just because or for her. And it sucks when me, and the child, and just a person outside of that relationship notices this. But I didn't say anything for so long because I felt like it wasn't my place, it's not my relationship.

To me, it seems like he has just gotten so used to lying to everyone, and happy with her doing everything for him, that he's afraid to lose his ""live in maid"" basically. After the DUI issue, I found out from my friend that my father told her and her dad (my father's only friend, and only because the other man doesn't have anyone else,) that my mother had gotten arrested driving to get more alcohol. My friend was shocked when I told her the truth, and I was *baffled,* when she had told me that he lied to them and made my mom seem like a desperate alcoholic. When all she was trying to do was run away from my father because he had called the police on her, and probably lied to them.

For years now they've had issues of my mom finding dating websites and profiles on his phone and other platforms that they share. (Yes she's tried taking photos and documenting, but she just gets so hurt that she forgets to take evidence.) She would find fake dating profiles with his photo and name, texts to other ""women,"" and other things. They've talked, and he's apologized and said he would never do it again. Multiple times. Should she have left him the first or second time? Sure, but as an immigrant, she has none of her family here, and I'm assuming it's just been too scary, and she genuinely seems to care for him. Hindsight and all that, unfortunately the time has come later instead of earlier.

She always took care of him through all of the surgeries he has had (at least 3 on his knee and 4 on his back.) She doted on him and took care of him, bringing him food, feeding him, giving him medicine, dealing with his tantrums while he was on said strong medicine, and everything else. She was really upset a year ago when she had spent nearly a full month off of work taking care of him after a back surgery, and it turns out that he had been messaging a woman somewhere about ""needing a woman to take care of him and have a s\*xual relationship with"" *while she was feeding him and staying by his side and doing basically everything for him.*

***Basically,*** my father just went off the deep end this week. I'm writing this Friday evening, but this full issue got started last week Friday. Since my mom can't drive, she has to get a ride everywhere she wants to go. And, since my dad asked her to lose weight, she has been going to the gym like three times a week (and looks awesome, go mom!.) He had told her earlier that he had had one beer with a friend, and then nothing. But when she got into the car there was a twelve-pack in the back. She asked why he hadn't said that he went to get more drinks (and why it's on the property,) and he told her he didn't want her to freak out, and it's not a big deal. (I don't know where to insert this, but his drinking has been an issue for years, and he ""knows, he's been drinking since he was 16,"" but he hasn't done anything about it. When mom asked him to slow down or stop, he just started hiding his drinking or lying about it instead. She knows he does, but usually doesn't mention it to him, because he just starts blaming it on her being controlling, ""nagging, and up his butt."")

This Wednesday, he came come and stunk (both of alcohol and because he's gross and only showers like once a week because ""his back hurts too much,"") and was slurring his words. Mom asked him straight up whether he had been drinking or not, and he said no 3 or more times, just kept repeating no. So she had gotten worried whether he had had a *stroke* or not, since he couldn't speak right. She was worried about him, and he just waved her off and went to his workshop. She was still worried so went to talk to him more, and he started yelling at her about more ""controlling and bugging"" and that he had went and had drinks but didn't want to tell her because she would just ""nag him about it."" This is probably the first time he has so deliberately lied to her face straight out, and I guess she was finally at the point of being done. We tried talking to him and he started crying about how he's ""so screwed up in the head and nothing's right and he's so sorry he doesn't know what he's doing anymore."" He was sobbing and apologizing, and complaining about how the whole issue with her DUI has just been so hard on him and he's messed up from his childhood and everything but accountability. (As far as I have gathered, his mother was an alcoholic and his father was abusive and died young, so he was raised by his 6 older brothers, who basically just beat him up and then sent him to the army. He's never been on the front lines or in the war, he got a serious knee injury 2 years into basic training and was discharged for it. So I guess this is why he is how he is, but like, that isn't really and excuse?? He could have gone to get help, and has just never bothered, probably preferring to use all of this as an excuse for all of his actions instead of taking responsibility for being a jacka\*\* and ruining all his relationships.)

She asked him why he had lied, and he just got upset and tried to get in his truck to drive away. Because she's a good wife, she tried to stop him, and asked him not to drive and to please stay. He just kept repeating ""no, I want space, go away I want space, give me space, leave me alone I want space."" To me, it basically seemed like a little kid throwing a tantrum. I was trying to get him to give me the keys the whole time and to just let me drive him somewhere if he wanted space. He had nearly drove over her foot before I yelled at him to stop.

Eventually he got out and went to his workshop, and we just left him alone. We thought he had been staying at the workshop, but then at like 2 AM, mom got a text from his only friend that he was drunk passed out on his couch. We don't know when he left, but the argument and fiasco with the car was about 8 PM Wed.

I think this is when she was on the edge of being done. He had left when she had begged him to stay. He was out all night until he showed up late Thursday evening, so he had spent the whole night and day away. Today, Friday morning he left around 9 AM (after mom had left for work) and just showed up while I'm writing this at 11 PM.

This afternoon when mom got home from work, she was just so tired and sad. She said that she ended up seeing the ATM withdrawals on their joint account, and when it came through, she had looked up the ATM. It had ended up being at a str\*p club. So he went out, left her at home after she had begged him to stay, and went to get drunk and cheat on her. She ended up calling her therapist to try to make sense out of this, and her best friend, who has been telling her to leave my father for a while now. (Mom said that at the time it made her mad, that her friend would tell her that about the husband that she loved, but she sees it now why.) She told me everything of her side as much as she could.

I don't want to take sides but, I've never been close to my father, and had already decided to go ""no contact"" with him when I moved out, like over a year ago. But since they were letting me stay at the house for help and minimum payment, I took the offer. But we've never been close, because he has never been able to hold a conversation with me about any of my interest for years now. It always turns to things he likes, things he did, and how I should have done those things like him, instead of what I was doing at the time, no matter if it was sports, woodworking, or any art that I like. (He basically raised me as a son, and treated me like one too. I was always too girly, too ""crying like a girl,"" could do more sports, but also should have dressed more like a girl, and be more like a mother and help around with cleaning the house. I don't know how it was to him, but to me, it felt like I was never good enough to him.) So we're not close, and honestly, I don't have any lost feeling towards him, just tiredness and anxiety.

***So yeah, my mom is done done, and ready to leave. But she has 2 more months on probation without being able to drive herself anywhere but work or a doctor's appointment. They're been married for 30 years, and she's just scared of what he's going to do to her. He can be so mean, and she doesn't know what he's capable of right now, when he went and so deliberately threw their entire marriage in the trash with the past couple of days.***

^(Sorry for basically just rambling by the end. It's a lot, and I'm overwhelmed, and I'm just so scared for what is going to happen to my mom.)

# Here's the detail breakdowns of any info I have that might pertain to any help or questions:

\*\*-\*\*I believe in Florida, if a couple has been married for more than 20 years they have to split assets 50/50? They're been married for 30 years (last year.)

\*\*-\*\*Unfortunately, as it's the weekend right now, any lawyers are unavailable until Monday, 2 days away.

\*\*-\*\*They both have a joined banking account, but also both have a separate savings, as well as both have a 401 k. The bills are mostly being paid with her paycheck, and only half of his income gets put into the joined account.

\*\*-\*\*They own a property in a different European country, and both of their names are on the property, I'm unsure of how this would be affected.

\*\*-\*\*He's a 100% disabled veteran (after lying about his conditions of course,) and currently has a larger income from that than my mom does with her salary.

\*\*-\*\*My mother has a credit card with a balance of 0 that she always pays off. My father has a credit card with 10k debt  on there because of all of the random toys and tools he buys (as well as all of the scams he falls for and the money he's probably been sending other women, though there's no concrete evidence for this.)

\*\*-\*\*My mom hasn't told my father that she knows about the cheating at the club just yet, they literally haven't spoken a word to each other since Wednesday when my father left during the night. He has been sleeping on the couch and hasn't tried talking to either my mother or me.

\*\*-\*\*I believe they share the house/mortgage on the house. Both of their names are on the house. Both of their names are on \*her\* car. His name is on his car. His and my name are on my car. Both of their names are on a joint account. And both of their names are on the property in Europe, even though my mom handles all of the landlord responsibilities, and he hasn't even spoken to the current renters.

# Here's some of my questions I guess, but I'd appreciate any tips or steps you think me or my mom could take:

\-My mother has not been able to contact a lawyer yet, but will Monday. **Are there any specific questions she should ask about if you know?**

**-Do you have any general tips for dealing with a person like this?** He's emotionally abusive and might even turn to physical abuse, though I'm not sure of this. He's narcissistic and never takes any responsibility for what he does wrong.

**-What can she do when they live in the same household?** Currently they're not interacting any, but it's about to be the weekend, and I don't know what's going to happen. I feel it best to keep him in the dark as long as possible, because the moment he knows she's getting ready to leave, he's going to start doing heinous things to her on purpose and emotionally abusing her even more. (I'm here too, but honestly I'm done being nice to him, and I'm leaving in a couple of weeks, hopefully, for a job. He's burned his bridge with me, I'm just going to deal with his bs and never talk to him again after. But I'm also scared of him, and still have to live in the same household for now as well. If you have any tips for me as well, I'd appreciate it too.)

**-Any tips for keeping evidence?** I know FL is a 2 party state, so me or my mom can't just go and record their arguments without him knowing about it if he starts something. But is there anything there we *can* do that you can think of?

**PETTY ALERT**

**-I'm done being nice to him, if anyone knows is there anything I can do during/after to screw him over?** He lied about a lot of stuff when getting his 100% veteran status and benefits. Is there anything I can report there? Or report benefits abuse? I don't know, but I just.. I'm going scorched earth on this if I have to, I'll take the karma that comes with it, my mom doesn't deserve any of this, and I'm willing to take the hit here.  
He also lied to the police at least twice, at least once after he physically assaulted our neighbor and talked his way out of it by acting frail and pulling the old scared veteran defending himself. This is Florida/the south, the veteran status means too much around here sometimes, and people abuse it to get away with things, like my dad. Maybe twice with the DUI situation with my mother, but I didn't hear the phone call, so I don't actually know.  
**Can I report him to the VA or anything?** I would do this after the divorce, but I'd like to know any options I have. I'll look more info up, but if anyone knows anything I'd appreciate it.

# TLDR:

My father is a POS that has decided to end his 30 year marriage by leaving in the middle of the night to get drunk and cheat on my mother after throwing a child-like tantrum and not taking responsibility for his drinking problems. He has been emotionally abusive to her for years, and she has finally decided to divorce him and leave. I don't know if he knows that she has made this choice, as he has not spoken to her in two days since he decided to leave without telling anyone.

Me and my mom would appreciate any recommendations, ideas, or even general tips on how to proceed with this without making everything worse, since my father is both an emotionally and physically volatile person.

We are unable to contact someone for another 2 days during the weekend and are too overwhelmed to think about how to proceed.

**Any help would be immensely appreciated. Thank you for reading.**",1,1741451526.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1j6ku8v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6ku8v,Cringy emotional controlling “business” to girl I’m dating,"A girl I’ve recently started dating told me about her singing teacher. She is 26 and he is 72, which is already quite a gap, and he is her “mentor” and “coach”. 

She pushed back our walk because he wanted to spend FIVE HOURS with her, buys her lunch and coffee, and is buying her a birthday present next week. She is quite impressionable. She says his style is “unconventional” and gets into her deep psyche prompting “emotional reconditioning” and that if she has bad dreams and feels light-headed that this is normal. Now he wants to start a “business” with her where it is vague self-directed learning videos that channel your inner feelings. 

She is singled out as the “quickest to learn” in all his years of teaching. She had to sign a Non Disclosure Agreement and a male friend of hers backed out of the “business” when he realized what was happening. Even ChatGPT identified SEVERAL red flags when I copied the business policies, amongst which it is “highly inappropriate” to back out of performances. Clothes must be “form-fitting”, there is a “dark week” at the end of the month, and payment is expected well in advance with little room to cancel lessons. 

His studio is in the basement of a church, his business is not public on Google and there are no testimonies or reviews. I’m genuinely concerned about how deep his emotional control is going and what she will sacrifice (wants to quit her job as a nurse for this). I haven’t told her this because I don’t want her to run, but it may be a lost cause. Part of me wants to hire an investigator. He convinced her to delete all photos of herself on Instagram because Meta will take them. Any tips on how to carefully approach would help! Even many comments so I can one day show her how wrong this is. ",2,1741451426.0,mlmscams,0,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I usually shop at Market Basket or Walmart super center, both of which sell plenty of fresh and frozen vegetables. I can easily get other nutritious foods like nuts, EV olive oil, fish, chicken, whole wheat bread, and minimally processed cheese.

  
Even the restaurants ones I go to nowadays have at least something healthy.

In recent years, I have travelled abroad to multiple countries, and was expecting the food available to the public to be extra healthy, but that was far from reality.

In Spain, it is nearly impossible to find meals for someone who does not eat red or processed meat. Almost everything had ham or pork. Aside from tomatoes, there were hardly any vegetables. And breakfast... No such thing. It's literally coffee with pastries full of refined four and sugars. Not to mention, the coffee was usually *torrefacto* (beans roasted in sugar), which means that you'd still have sugar in your coffee even if you did not ask them to add any. And I don't think I ate anything whole grain.

Greece was considerably better, however the presence of pastries everywhere was still damning and I have not noticed this much anywhere in the US.

In India (where my extended family lives), you cannot even walk down the street for a few minutes without the smell of delicious  snacks being cooked at food stalls. And these are deep fried, high sugar, high fat snacks that will cut years off your life. Whenever you visit someone, expect them to serve you a platter of packaged snacks. Not to mention that chai (tea) and coffee have tons of sugar unless you tell them not to add it. My relatives always asked me ""Are you eating okay back in America?"" And I have to tell them that ""my diet at home is far superior to what you guys eat here.""

Yet somehow America is considered one of the most unhealthy countries in the world? 

Yes, there is plenty of junk food in our country. But I just don't think it deserved the criticism it gets.

Is it normal to feel jealous of my girlfriend's coworker?

My girlfriend and I have the most stable relationship, and until this happened, we had the blind trust that could exist. We've been together for 8 years, from the age of 18 until now, and we've never had issues with jealousy because we both trust each other completely. My friends are all men, and hers were more mixed, but there was never a problem or even the slightest hint of risk of infidelity.

She started a new job about a year ago, and for the past 4-5 months, she's been building a friendship with a coworker. At first, it was jokes and things like that, but as time goes on, it seems they're getting closer. They post photos together when they go out for coffee, and she tells me they have a somewhat physical way of joking around—he leans on her, she tickles his armpits, etc. On top of that, they discuss sexual topics in their conversations (for example, our sex life boils down to once a month or every two months, and he gives her advice on what I might like or things like that, jokingly, but these topics have become regular in their conversations). She tells me all of this; she hides nothing from me, and because of the trust we have, I assume she sees it as normal. But with each passing day, it weighs on me more and more.

Given the type of relationship we have, I don't want her to feel that I distrust her in any way because she's always been very honest about her daily life and never hides anything she does. But for the first time in 8 years, I truly feel uncomfortable with a friendship she has.

Is their relationship normal? Is it normal for women to have that level of trust with a male friend they met a year ago?",2,1741451324.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I was recently bedridden for three weeks with horrible sciatica stemming from a herniation at L5-S1 and I had a microdisectomy this past Monday after being admitted to the hospital for pain control. 

So far the recovery has been easy and I had immediate relief from the sciatica when I woke up. I'm so happy I did it! I don't know how all of you suffer for so long. 

My question is how long was it before you could sit down at a 90 degree angle for any length of time? I'm talking sitting in a dining chair, a car, at an event, at a desk for work, etc?

Does anyone have any advice on how to speed this part of recovery along? I want to get back to my life and back to work! I know I'm impatient and just need to chill; I'm doing my best!

I got diagnosed a few years ago now with ADHD finally. It’s a long story bc at first I was on meds for fibro and then once I started vyvanse I had serotonin syndrome. But we took a break and I went straight on vyvanse only. 

So I was taking 40 mg but I’ll be honest I wasn’t the best at nourishing myself and taking care of my own needs on vyvanse. I can’t say forsure vyvanse worked for me or didn’t since I could take it in the morning and not eat til the afternoon and eat minimal all day til like dinner ish time while making dinner. That was most days. Some days I’d have a salad in the afternoon if I was being forced to eat since my family was noticing I wasn’t eating and was losing weight. 

I was having mood issues on it also. But again I don’t know if it was bc of my eating or bc it was vyvanse giving me those issues. But I had a lot of body pain also. I was so tense. I wasn’t worried about my drinking. I was probably dehydrated. I drank but def wasn’t ontop of it like I needed to be! 

I only drank decaf unless I was really tired. 

Eventually my rage was a lot to handle for everyone. I cut down to 30. My family was saying they liked me before meds lol 😂 but they also don’t understand adhd and stuff so I was masking it. I was also having a lot of bruxism then and jaw pain and body pain. Tight neck shoulders pecs. I took magnesium at night but it was mostly so I could empty my bowels in the morning. 

But bc my jaw pain was a lot and I didn’t think it was bc I was mineral deficient and magnesium def and wasn’t focused on drinking water… I thought ok I can’t take this pain back to the doctor I go. He cut me back to 10 then 20 and o had pain so I got off it. Again I wasn’t drinking and taking minerals. 

I came off vyvanse and it was horrible!! My body hated it. I was so emotional and all over the place. I was crying and sad and I was gaining weight and body fat. I feel so uncomfortable in my body. I also felt tired and groggy and I couldn’t function. Eveything was hard. My hot girl walks were hard to do!! On vyvanse I could do it. Without them I couldn’t. 

So when I finally had my doctors appt he wanted me to try adderall XR and we started with 10. I really started to pay attention to my water intake. I was forcing myself to non stop drink!! I would drink minimum 80 oz during the day with Himalayan sea salt. And I would drink my decaf coffee and my tea during the day/night (chamomile) 

I was taking magnesium also to help during the day to make sure my muscles weren’t tense. And at night too. All I know is adderall is hurting my stomach. I would be in the kitchen and bent over dying of pain. I don’t remember ever being like this. This past week I couldn’t even more or sit or walk I was in so much pain. Upper left and lower left abdomen KILLING! And I’m still drinking my water. 

I don’t know why adderall is KILLING my stomach. It’s constipating me and causing my bowels to tense up. I’m taking prebiotics with probiotics. I’m drinking.  I’m talking magnesium all day long. 

My next soctoes appt is five weeks. I don’t know what to do. I didn’t wanna take my adderall this morning cause I didn’t wanna be in more pain all weekend. But I took 10XR instead of the 20. I went to the washroom but right after my stomach was hurting me. I can’t breathe. What is going on?! What do I do!?  I feel legit crazy. I’m coming here bc you guys get the struggle! 

Has this happened to anyone who switched from vyvanse to adderall XR? I totally thought they had the same side effects? I can’t concentrate on anything but my stomach is killing me. I can’t breathe. It’s really affecting my mental health and body image too. 

Thanks for letting me share. I know what’s personal is universal. So if you have the same struggles I’m sharing so you know you aren’t alone 💜

Recently, I heard a story about someone getting hacked while on public Wi-Fi, which got me worried since my laptop has a lot of sensitive client information. I’ve been looking into VPNs as a way to protect my data when using public networks, and they seem useful for security and even for accessing content from other countries. However, I’m on a budget and not sure if a VPN is worth the expense, plus I’m concerned it might slow down my internet connection. Have any of you used a VPN? Did it make you feel safer, and do you think it’s worth the investment? I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts or experiences. Thanks!",1,1741451079.0,VPNFreaks,1,1.0,False

Don’t get me wrong I love my family and folks who are asking and stuff… but they know how private I am and that I’ll let them know once he’s here and I want to share the news!! 

Also, unrelated question… me and my husband live in a very small town kind of far away from family members.. my grandma (75 y old) came to visit and help us out a bit … I love her so much and she does so much for her sister when she’s at her place where they live together even though my grandma is older but she’s the one taking care of her sister so I accepted her coming to “help” but more to have her have like a month vacation from all the stress back home w her family… so I’m basically taking care of her in the sense I’ll cook and make her coffee, some tea and stuff .. she’s very happy about it I told her just chill and relax… 

Recently I told her once it’s time to go to the hospital I rather her to stay home and waiting for us to be back (it’s a 45 min drive) and it gets very cold in there and you get in at a time and don’t know what time you will be leaving .

There are some fun behind-the-scenes perspectives in this article. 

“When it came to Meghan's presence on set, Steed describes her as ""friendly"" and approachable, creating a ""comfortable environment"" for everyone involved.

""Her relationship with the crew became really tight fairly quickly. She has an understanding of what it means to be on set and she connected with the crew more than anyone.”

Despite the high pressure of shooting, Steed notes that the atmosphere was still ""chill"" and ""fun."" “Everyone was a pro all the way through. She's a pro,"" he says…

At the heart of the show, he adds, is the ethos of going the extra mile for others. “I know it sounds corny, but I really think the core of Meghan’s being is her generosity. She wants to do the extra thing, and I think that’s something everyone should take to heart.”

""Most of the time, we're expected to fade into the background, to be invisible,"" a crew member tells PEOPLE about the collaborative atmosphere on set. ""But in this show, we were part of it. We were included. It was a very unique and refreshing experience.""

He adds that Meghan was incredibly ""warm,"" ""approachable"" and ""genuine."" ""She made sure everyone felt included, from Netflix executives to our director to every PA on set. No one was left out,"" he says.

“During a break in filming, Meghan asked everyone about their favorite cocktails. I shared that I gave up drinking when I became a father, so I’ve been sober for almost 14 years,” the crew member says. Days later, while adjusting her microphone, Meghan surprised him when she mentioned how much she respected the commitment he’d made to his family. “Meghan made us feel seen,” he shares.

Each week, Meghan did something thoughtful for the crew. ""Whether it was a coffee cart in the morning or there was one day where the forecast called for it to be particularly hot, and she had a shaved ice truck for us at lunch,"" he says. ""One day, she had a bespoke ice cream cart with local homemade ice cream. She had an acai truck for us, too. Every week, she did something like that for us. It was really lovely.""

About what it really means to be In this Citizen’s Forum, local student columnist and journalist Emily Hess has something to say about being dismissed, underestimated, and told to just *get used to it.* About taking up space in a world that tries to shrink you. About what it really means to be *silenced.*

This International Women’s Day, it’s time to start taking women seriously. Stay loud. Stay seen. Stay *unapologetic.*

\*\*\*\*\*

I didn’t want to believe this is how it is.

I wanted to believe that if I worked hard enough, if I wrote well enough, if I carved out space with enough care, people would respect it. I wanted to believe that my words would matter because they were honest, because they were thoughtful, because I put pieces of myself into them. I wanted to believe that I could be funny and still be serious, that I could be vulnerable and still be strong, that I could write about my life and still be seen as a *real* writer.

But that’s not how it is.

How it is, is that my male colleagues mock my column to my face, reducing it to punchlines they think are funnier than the ones I actually write. It’s *fluff*, they say. Light. Soft. Not real journalism. The kind of thing you skim while waiting for your coffee but never something worth remembering. They joke about it, send me screenshots with sarcastic commentary, skim just enough to find something to poke fun at.

How it is, is that my female colleagues don’t take me seriously either. They don’t mock me outright, but they don’t respect my work. They don’t hand me real news. When I pitch something weightier, something that doesn’t have a clever little anecdote at the start, they smile, nod, and then give it to someone else. As if I don’t have the range. As if I haven’t proven that I can write something with depth. As if the fact that I write about love, about friendship, about heartbreak, about what it means to be *a person in the world*, makes me unqualified to write about anything else.

As if I can only do one thing.

As if I am only one thing.

And now there are *suggestions*—not orders, not outright bans, but quiet, patronizing suggestions—that maybe I shouldn’t cover certain things. That maybe I should stick to what I know. That maybe I can’t be trusted to separate my personal life from my work.

And then last month, a male colleague took down my piece. Just like that. Gone. Said it was *flooding his section.* Said it was a logistical thing. Said it wasn’t personal.

When I reacted to it I was met with: *""You were not silenced.""*

Like he thought I needed to hear it. Like he thought this was all just a misunderstanding. Like saying the words would make them true.

You were not silenced.

Because my phone still works, right? Because I can still type. Because I haven’t been erased entirely, only *managed*, only *redirected*, only *made to fit within the lines someone else drew for me.*

You were not silenced.

Because I still exist. Because my voice was not taken—only diminished, only muted, only made smaller by someone who had the power to do so. Because I was not locked out, only *pushed aside*.

Because in his mind, silence only counts if it’s absolute.

And that is the most frustrating thing. The way men like him can act like it doesn’t *count*—like my voice wasn’t *really* taken from me, because I still have the ability to make noise. As if silencing a woman only matters if you put a hand over her mouth instead of just turning down her microphone.

Because that’s how it is.

How it is, is that I have watched a male colleague get away with things that I would be fired for. No consequences, no reprimands, no one looking at him sideways. He makes mistakes that get brushed off. He crosses lines that are easily forgiven. He gets second chances I will never be given. He takes up space without apologizing for it. And it isn’t just him—it’s the system that allows him to do it. That lets him be reckless, and flawed, and unpolished, while I have to be perfect.

And when I point it out, when I say *this isn’t fair*, I get the same response every time:

*""That’s just the way it is.""*

Like it’s something I need to accept. Like I should just get used to it. Like it’s an inevitable fact of life, like gravity or taxes or the fact that I will never be able to wear white without spilling something on myself.

And I think that is inherently flawed.

Because telling me *that’s just the way it is* isn’t an explanation—it’s an excuse. It’s a way to dismiss the problem without actually engaging with it. It’s a way of saying, *this isn’t fair, but we’ve all decided to live with it, so you should too.* It’s a way of making me feel like the difficult one for wanting things to be different.

But I refuse to accept it.

Because I have two degrees. I am smart. I put myself through school. I work five jobs. I put in the hours. I earn my place. And yet, my intelligence is devalued because of *when* I write and *what* I write. I am seen as unserious because I write about emotions, as if emotions aren’t the very thing that drive every major decision people make. As if politics, business, war, and history aren’t all shaped by the same human impulses I explore in my work—love, fear, power, grief, ambition.

And yet, I’m the one who is constantly told to just deal with it. To let things go. To stop making a fuss.

Get used to men getting more chances than you.  
Get used to your work being seen as lesser.  
Get used to people not taking you seriously.  
Get used to walking a tighter rope.  
Get used to having to work twice as hard for half as much.

But why should I?

Women deserve to be in all spaces.

Women deserve to be political reporters and fashion writers and investigative journalists and entertainment critics. Women deserve to write about war and lipstick and social justice and dating and crime and relationships and global crises. Women deserve to be taken seriously no matter what they write about, no matter what they look like, no matter *when* or *how* they speak.

Because there is no such thing as *fluff.*

There is no such thing as a topic that doesn’t matter, because people matter. The things that make us human matter. And writing about emotions—writing about the experiences that shape who we are—is just as valid, just as real, just as *journalistic* as writing about anything else.

So take me seriously. Take all of us seriously.

Because the thing about fluff is that it only exists in contrast to something else. You don’t call something light unless you think there is something heavier it should be measured against. You don’t call something soft unless you think the real work is made of something harder. But the truth is, the things I write about—love, loss, loneliness, the complicated mess of being human—*are* heavy. They just don’t look like it. They don’t come packaged in hard edges. They don’t pretend to be unshakable.

And maybe that’s what scares them.

Maybe people don’t take my words seriously because I don’t perform seriousness the way they expect me to. Maybe because I don’t write with a sharper edge, they assume my work doesn’t have weight. Maybe because I write about heartbreak instead of hard news, they assume I am not capable of reporting on the things that *matter.*

But tell me—what’s heavier than the things that stay with you? What’s heavier than the things you carry for years, the things you still feel even when they’re gone?

I could write the stories they want me to. I could stop being funny. I could strip my work down until there’s no softness left in it. I could force my words into the shape of something sharper, something harder, something less like myself. But that wouldn’t make them respect me. It would only make me a hollow version of what they expect. And that’s not the point.

I didn’t start writing to be what other people wanted me to be.

I started writing because I wanted to tell the truth.

And the truth is, I *was* silenced.

The only thing I've ever wanted to do is work in music, which can't be achieved academically. I had no new friends, was living alone in a new city, and, most importantly, knew literally no one in the local scene. I was pessimistic too, I guess, since when I did meet someone in a local band at work one day, I assumed he'd just wanted another body in the room at his shows. 

Obviously, I'm writing this, and we started hooking up. I knew a friends-with-benefits relationship with a lead singer 14 years older than me was perhaps the most laughably predictable mistake; he was on a pedestal the moment I met him and I knew I would lose more sleep over the end of our finite time than he. In general, I have a history of forsaking clear boundaries in favor of feeling loved however precariously, but this time I told myself it was all ok because I'd end up a better person in the end. I reminded myself it'd likely end in us parting ways so I could move on with what I'd learned from him. Only now, I'm also his guitar tech. It's been a huge source of anxiety, knowing if I mess up an already delicate happiness I'd found in him I might also lose the sense of fulfillment he's given me. 

Two days ago, he told me in maybe the most painful way possible things might be ending. After rehearsal he hugged me and said he needed to tell me something. ""I might be seeing someone so we might need to put a hold on our friends with benefits thing."" He continued to talk about how he doesn't know where it'll go, he isn't even really looking for a relationship, how he knows I know how to have fun and should meet more people. ""I'll miss it though,"" he'd said. Miss what, me or my bed? Not once did he let go and when I looked up to maybe step back and collect myself, he kissed me harder and longer than our usual goodbye. Even then, he didn't let go. 

I know I'm probably just 20, enamored by feeling loved by someone I admire. It's just so hard to tell right now between the end of the world and a hard lesson I'll look back on softly years from now.  But all I can think about when I'm trying to fall asleep now are the quick moments in which I could convince myself he's been trying to tell me something this whole time, like soft kisses at the top of my head or meeting his mom or when he came over between errands not to end up in my bed but just have lunch. It's harder now to ignore that while he may have enjoyed just teaching me things and feeling smart, in doing so he had to watch me stumble over progressions be played flawlessly and cook me dinner every time with my ""help."" I'm terrified in trying to not get invested and make the end easier, I completely missed any opportunity to give us more time. 

Tonight at a show will be the last time I see him for a couple weeks whether or not I say something. I want to tell him how I feel because I know it'll kill me pretending I feel nothing when I see him again and again. But what if I say nothing and that's what he'd been waiting for this whole time? What if I lose every other amazing thing he's given me? Would it be a mistake for me to pursue anything real with him to begin with? If I say something I risk losing him and the shows and friends and community I have now, but if I say nothing I'll never know how he felt and it might ruin whatever relationship I have left with him. I just know, at the very least, the person I marry will probably know his name. I'll think of him as I spend the rest of my life pursuing my career and I'll think of him when I make my coffee in the morning with ginger syrup. I want nothing but the best for him, his happiest self, but I don't know how I'll handle seeing it. 

This all feels like a bad 21st century version of Call Me By Your Name. I guess, ultimately, is it better to speak or to die?

1j6kj3i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6kj3i,Advice to upgrade,"I want to replace this curved antique couch in my kitchen. It’s a very cool piece but it’s driving me absolutely bonkers for a few reasons and I hate it more every day. I’m at a point in my life where I’m turning over some of the mishmash cheap/free furniture I initially collected and am looking to curate a more cohesive and intentional space. 

My goals for this corner are:
- cozy space to read and drink coffee in the morning
- ideally two people can cuddle 
- get some additional storage in here too (bookshelf, etc — this apartment has ZERO CLOSETS)
- mesh with the vibe of the kitchen while also bringing in elements of the living room (which we love) 
- carry forward a touch of unique — I love interesting furniture which is how I ended up with the curved couch in the first place! (Preferably second hand pieces)
- avoid cheap products or pieces of furniture that are clearly IKEA/Wayfair/etc (not that I wouldn’t buy these, I just HATE the classic recognizable cheap styles)
- not spend a lot of money to do it (<$500)

I browse FB Marketplace like a madman and have been for a couple months, but am a) having trouble finding something cool and unique that doesn’t cost >$800, b) having trouble approaching what pieces to get / get first to upgrade the space, given second hand shopping can be fickle, and c) what I even really want it to look like, especially as it seems the kitchen vibe is quite old farmhouse rustic and removed from the essence of the living room.

My family knows this and refuses to make plans with me in advance but gets super mad when I can’t make it to last minute stuff. They think I am selfish for not going. 

Now: my sister mentioned a month or two ago she was throwing a party this sunday and I said I would be there. Flash forward to last weekend and I havent heard anything at all about this party. So, I ask her if it was still happening. She said she wasn’t sure because she had forgotten about it completely and hadn’t invited anyone. She also said she might have to move it to a different day. She never said anything else about this party. I even saw her yesterday for coffee. I made plans for this weekend and all of a sudden this morning she texted me asking if I would be at the party tomorrow. I responded and said “maybe, I didnt know it was happening tomorrow, you said you would let me know” And then she got annoyed with me and said that “she would let me know IF it changes and it didn’t change”. But last I asked she literally did not have a plan for the party at all! I know if I don’t rearrange my whole weekend to go my family will berate me for not going and I will hurt my sister’s feelings. However, I have also expressed to them countless times how stressed out I get about this stuff and to just let me know in advance and they never do. AITA if I don’t go? I really don’t want to.

1j6kh3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AR9/comments/1j6kh3h/colorado_gun_laws/,Colorado Gun Laws,"Dear Blowback9,

Thanks for all you do and it’s why I send coffee!  I was going to message directly but figured some others may want to hear your response. We have some crazy gun bills going through our state legislature in Colorado specifically targeting ARs. My question is what AR-9 lowers and complete guns would you buy now knowing your future purchases may be limited. The dream would be  Ronin suppressed MPX and SP5 but I’m spending my money buying lowers in multiple calibers so the nazis can’t make me register. I may buy one complete but at least three lowers. Thinking about Foxtrot Mike and Banshees. Your objective advice is greatly appreciated. 

Also wanting advice from others. Thanks!",0,1741450451.0,AR9,3,0.5,False

Is there any accessory to kinda put over the existing cup holder to increase its height or maybe sort of put a heightened cup holder over the existing one ?",1,1741450451.0,HyundaiVenue,1,1.0,False
