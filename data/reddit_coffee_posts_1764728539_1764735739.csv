Im a 50 yo woman from San Francisco, &  I’m going to be visiting my son who’s studying in AU in a few weeks. We’re trying to plan a road trip up the coast. I’m landing in Sydney, & I’m trying to decide if I should skip it & meet my son in Armidale, then drive up the coast to Cairns & Brisbane. Were much more nature oriented than city, and besides the Opera House, Sydney feels very similar to SF. What do you think?  We’re very interested in the beaches, snorkeling, fishing (him), coffee shops, small beach towns, the rainforest in Cairns, etc. the only thing I think I’d be bummed to miss in Sydney is the Blue Mts. I have 12 days. Thanks so much for your time and help!

1pcugdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1pcugdt/amon_turns_eighteen/,Amon Turns Eighteen,"One does not jerk awake and pummel the nearest solid object in a half-asleep stupor if one had not been asleep to begin with. So Amon rises calmly at dawn and lights the dim lamp at his bedside table. He stares at the envelope and small cardboard box that sit in its golden pool. Then he switches off the lamp and gets ready in the darkness.

It is going to be a day. The sting of a cold shower and a folate-rich bowl to start the begin. Some reading, attendance, an archery lesson. Lunch, more reading, chores, and thinking. Dinner. Some more thinking. And most excitedly, *Chapter 11: The Triumphs and Travails of the Jefferson Republic, 1800-1812*.

One thing at a time.

The morning sun's orange rays have barely begun to filter through the windows when Amon sits on his bed again, hair dripping onto the shoulders of a thick maroon sweater. He tears into the envelope. A freshly printed photograph of two little boys holding up a bucket of sand on the beaches of Cape Cod flutters out of the cat-patterned card inside. Something's stuck to the photo's back. Amon reads the card first.

*Big Mon!*

*You've done it. The age of performing the upmost civic duty. And also voting (Because I first meant buying cigarettes).*

Amon slides his glasses down his nose to rub his eyes with a sigh.

*I don't know why I said that because I wouldn't. Anyway, tough to beat the Death Star, so I'm mixing it up. Mainly because I'd rather tell you in-person than write in this card. And I left the legos untouched so that we could do it together.*

*Don't you dare flake. Come see* [*the seal*](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1limw1p/amon_sits_on_his_bed_to_read_a_letter/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)*.*

Taped to the back of the photo of the gap-toothed grinning pair is a train ticket to Boston on December 30th.

He already knows what's in the small cardboard box, so he leaves it be under his pillow. It can wait patiently for its new owner to procure a golden chain.

The rest of the morning to midday passes normally, albeit lighter than usual. Scrambled eggs taste better when there's eight in the pan, and the intermediate archery lesson manages to run without a single arrow in someone's rump. Amon is taking notes on Lattimer's *Works and Days* late-afternoon, posture at ease, when the mob from the after-school shuttle fills Hestia's Hearth with its usual bustle. 

He peers out the window of Cabin Seven, surveying the chattering teens out front. Watches his own cabinmates that don't attend the school saunter out to meet their commuting camp friends. The last girl out leaves the bright yellow door is left haphazardly open, bringing the biting December wind into the sunny common room. 

Amon stands to close it, then turns to sit back down. Stands again, walks to pluck his thick blue coat off the coat rack, and sits back down in the chair. Stands for a third time, grabs a boxed chess set off a coffee table, and walks out the door, closing it behind him.

He moves quick, moving through the crowd that he knows will thin soon. But thanks to his Legendary Sight, it does not take long to find the familiar blue-eyed boy-- the more muted, pensive one of the two. Amon approaches Harvey with his usual stony expression. 

""Harvey,"" he greets simply. ""Hello. Do you want to play chess today?"" Amon was free after chores. Before dinner. Before bed. Any time.",1,1764735424.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,1.0,False

I’m Wilder (3mo, M) and I’m the cyoootest cherub around. I go to work with the mommy person (cute but older than she looks, powered by coffee) every day and I work so hard. That place couldn’t run without me. I’m a super-de-duper-supervisor according to Auntie (older than the mommy person but still cute, needs less coffee). I see Auntie A LOT and I love her. I save my bestest smiles (and my biggest poops) for her! 

I was a scrawny little baby but I’m now a chonky-chunk according to everyone. Auntie loooooves to hold me when she and the mommy are meeting. We sit in the comfy chair with the big pillows usually. Sometimes I have to push against her so I can stand up and tell everyone what I think. It’s fun to hear her say “Oof” when I push hard because I have Important Things to say. However this room has gotten boring. I like to be carried in the hallway and I really like it when Auntie jiggles me up and down just a little bit. It makes the walls go all Scooby Doo swirly. She says I’m better than a Jim membership, whatever that is all about. We don’t even know any Jims. 

But today? Today Auntie says her biceps hurted from the jiggling already, and standing with me makes her back hurted too. I don’t know why she can’t just buy new biceps and a back from the store. That’s where we get my new diapies and everything else. So I cried. I cried loud and hard and wouldn’t stop after Auntie rudely sat back down with me. I spit my pacifier at her because OUTRAGE! No sitting when I want to stand. The mommy packed her ‘puter and her bags and then she taked me home.

Been with my girlfriend for 5 years. We’ve had our ups and downs as most couples do, but stuff we’ve always figured out and nothing major. 


Why I think she’s cheating: 

So lately (past 2-3 months or so) she’s been pretty distant. This happens sometimes, she’s been having a ton of stress at work. Usually only lasts a month or so though and then work chills out. This has lasted the longest. She barely wants to talk, doesn’t wanna have sex (we haven’t had sex in over a month and a half when we usually would 3-5 times a week). On top of that, she’s stopped bringing her schedule home (she works slight variable hours, but the same days bi weekly). When she always would. There was also one Sunday (I work sundays) where she left before I left for work and said she went to the mall to get coffee, shop,  read, and then grocery shop after. That’s all fine and dandy except 9/10 times she refuses to do stuff by herself other than grocery shop. In that same day she was very sporadic in texting me which she usually takes no more than 30mins to an hour if she’s busy. 

All of that alone I wasn’t even really thinking she was cheating at all, but the other day I noticed something. She got in the shower first (we usually shower together) and her phone went off as I was walking by to join her. I looked down, just because I heard it buzz and noticed she hid her front screen notification names. 

I thought hmm weird and immediately kinda pieced together the first paragraph coupled with her hiding that and obviously my mind went wild. I feel bad about this, but I did try her passcode to try and snoop. Her passcode has suddenly changed too. 

I calmly called her out first about just the Lock Screen as to not lead on knowing about the passcode just to see what she’d say. She said she did that because of a crazy co worker going through her desk. I cant argue with that, that’s believable.  What I can argue is that when I mentioned the passcode she said it was for the same reason. 

To me that just sounds asinine as how in the flying fuck would she know her passcode in the first place. To add on to this, when my girlfriend does talk, she’s always complaining about work. Usually the minute details as well. She has not mentioned this lady doing this at all in the last 2-3 months. Also she never even tried to say like “oh she looked over my shoulder so I changed it”. Literally just because she goes through the desk. 

She’s now offering me her passcode to her phone and to un hide her notifications, but by this point she would have had time to delete everything. Plus I do not want to be “that” couple. In my opinion that’s toxic as fuck. I declined that obviously. She’s basically just saying “what do you want me to do then” and kinda just sticking to the story of her crazy co worker. I’ve just stopped communicating for now because we were going in circles. 

One thing to add on, on why I think she may be cheating. She has a male co worker, who she’s good friends with. He’s going through a divorce and has confided in my girlfriend. In the past she would always talk about him and others at work. Her and her work colleges plus him would all go golfing Sunday’s which I never had issue with. She has now recently just not talked about him at all, but will talk about all her other co workers. <— this may be a little tin foily, but generally when people cheat, it’s with a co worker. I’ve also been spiraling in terms of thought trains if it’s not blatantly apparent. ",3,1764734237.0,AmIOverreacting,9,1.0,False
1pcu1zb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1pcu1zb/new_to_perimenopause/,New to perimenopause.,"Its 12/2/25. 48yo. Just started feeling off about three months ago. I thought it was late onset general anxiety (hers prescribed me Lexapro that I ended up not taking) or issues because I had been drinking a little more than normal. Then I started getting major night sweats and hot flashes, waking up at least once or twice a night, and crying at everything. 

Got with Midi health three weeks ago. Was prescribed the .0375 estradiol patch and 100 mg of progesterone. The progesterone helped me sleep better on day one and continues to do so. I could probably even increase the dose a little bit because I still wake up fairly easily at 4 or 5AM when my cats get up, though my heart rate isn’t elevated when I do like it was. 

The estrogen kind of right off the bat made me feel a little anxious like maybe I had had a cup of coffee, but was manageable. Then last Friday, two weeks into my being on the patch, I’ve noticed frequent, but mild, palpitations. They happen for most of the day and it’s freaking me out. I’m obsessing over my pulse oximeter. I also started my period a week early. 

Went to the emergency room on Sunday night because I couldn’t get my heart rate below 125. Got it to normal with an IV and just feeling safe. Normally, I’ll take a .25 of Xanax in case of panic, but I had had a couple drinks, so didn’t want to. It had been three weeks since I’ve had to take any Xanax, which I’m very happy about. I don’t like medication. 

Went to a regular doctor on Monday (yesterday) and she can hear the palpitations too and did some lab tests. She doesn’t seem to think there’s anything urgent happening. Both doctors have told me to lay off the alcohol for a while until I got my body right. She is also prescribing me a low-dose GLP-1.

Not sure what I’m looking for here, but I’m sitting in tears at a restaurant after walking 5 miles to get my favorite sushi so I could get my body moving and out of my head. I am also getting sporadic little pings of pain in my left breast.

Can anyone relate? I would love advice or comfort. Most of my girlfriends are 10+ years younger than me and I don’t really have any family. ❤️❤️❤️",2,1764734235.0,Menopause,0,1.0,False

* OEM '05-'06 Type S rims from a place called ""Autorimshop.com"". 17x7, with a 215/45R17 tire. Pros: it's what the JDM DC5 ITR was spec'd with, and what the USDM eventually moved to in the '05 model year. (Why they didn't do that in the early years in the US, I'll never know...) I'm NOT going to try to get the JDM DC5 rims, because I don't want to take a flyer on someone's used trash, and I don't like the white, and don't want to pay to refinish them. That, and the spacer issue, etc. The US market 17x7 look nice and do the job.

Bonus question: anyone deal with Autorimshop.com? They are selling ""remanufactured"" OEM rims.

* Enkei RPF1. 17x8 with a 225/45R17 tire. Pros: If I'm dropping extra money anyway, it might be a much better performance upgrade for equivalent money to option 1. Maybe. Depending on how many Google rabbit-holes you chase down, it might not actually be much of one at all. Cons: I don't have a ""wing"", or anime stickers, or a coffee can exhaust, nor will I. I've kept everything pretty much pristine factory spec since I purchased in '03, except for the aluminum billet DC5 shift knob. So the RPF1 might not really be the look I'm trying to achieve.

On the last point, one might wonder why change at all if I've kept everything factory. I was originally looking into dedicated winter rims for my winter tires, but decided; if I'm spending money, why not upgrade the summer/fun tires instead?",0,1764733999.0,Acura_RSX,1,0.5,False

So, last night, I go to the movies for the first time since the pandemic started because our 4 and 5 year old wanted to see Zootopia 2. Excellent movie, by the way.

Anyways, I get some sweet candy for the first time in years at concession (generally, IF on occasion I'm snacking on candy at home it is a cookie or Reese's of some kind), some Nerds Clusters.

They were good. Very sweet. I only ate half of the small bag. Everything tastes normal while I'm eating them. Then after the movie we all go out for burgers. Again, all tastes normal.

It wasn't until getting home, getting my kids ready for bed, getting ready myself, etc. that I was hit with the lingering taste of sugar on my tongue. Almost like a stinging, but more of a reminder of the sugary snack I had eaten hours earlier.

24 hours later and it has now been there ever since. Even after burgers, water, a shower, water, some chocolate milk, brushing my teeth before bed, waking up, breakfast, brushing my teeth, flossing, water, coffee, lunch, dinner, shower, brushing teeth, etc. this sugar lingering taste on my tongue, still. Almost like a tingle. 

It is a bit anxiety invoking but also a bit fascinating, I'm slightly worried. I've never had this happen before and I'm wondering the science behind it? Any ideas?! Thank you!",2,1764733587.0,candy,0,1.0,False
1pcttx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wroteabook/comments/1pcttx0/fragment_of_my_book_opinions/,Fragment of my book - opinions ?,"# HOW TO TURN YOU INTO A PERFECT SLAVE IN 24 HOURS

This isn’t a lecture.  
It’s more like I’m reading out loud what already runs in your head.

Not *their* manual.

Yours.

Because everything below? You help make it happen. Every. Single. Day.  
The system doesn’t run *in spite* of you. It runs *on* you.

I’m not gonna be gentle.  
You’ve had enough cute little lies.

# 1. Alarm: the first lie of the day

Alarm goes off.  
Your hand auto-grabs the phone.

Brain:

“I’ll just check the time… maybe one message…”

Yeah, no. You know that’s bullshit.

The first thing you do in the morning is **not** “check the time”.  
The first thing you do is: **hand your attention to strangers** before you even sit up.

Screen lights up like a tiny altar.  
Notifications pop like little pokes:

* someone posted a pic that makes your life look like the discount version,
* someone dropped a link designed to freak you out,
* some headline is constructed so you *have* to tap it.

It is **not** an accident that at the top you see:

* catastrophe,
* drama,
* an enemy,
* someone “better” than you.

That’s your **default loadout**:

a bit of fear + a bit of “I’m behind”.

Perfect marinade for your brain.  
You’ll stew in it till bedtime.

And the key thing:

**No one** is forcing you.

There’s no soldier by your bed.  
No law against leaving your phone in another room.

You put your own mental handcuffs on and say:

“I’m just checking what’s happening in the world.”

You’re not.  
You’re letting **someone else choose your mood for the day**.

# 2. Mirror: your body as a war zone

You walk into the bathroom.  
Glance in the mirror.

In theory you see “yourself”.  
In practice you see a **project that needs fixing**:

* too much here,
* not enough there,
* this already looks old,
* this doesn’t look young enough,
* this doesn’t look like Instagram.

Nobody walks up and tells you:

“You’re ugly.”

You’d tell them to fuck off.

Instead you get a thousand tiny jabs:

* “anti-aging” creams (aka: “fight the fact you’re alive”),
* flawless bodies on screens with no pores, no hair, no texture,
* memes “for fun” about how you *should* look at X age.

And suddenly there’s a quiet little script running:

“You’re not allowed to look like this.  
You’re not allowed to age like this.  
You’re not allowed to just… be like this.”

The brutal part?  
The system isn’t scared of you being “ugly”.

The system is scared of you **not hating yourself anymore**.

A person at peace with their body is a terrible customer:

* doesn’t need magic creams every month,
* doesn’t buy crash diets on impulse,
* doesn’t throw money at “treatments”,
* is harder to sell “you’re worthless without this”.

That’s why every morning you’re basically at a casting:

“Does my body qualify for this world today?”

And again:

It’s not that “they” drag you there.

**You run that inspection yourself.**  
Unpaid.  
Daily.

# 3. Commute: crash-course in conditioning

Car, bus, train – whatever.  
Earbuds in, instantly.

Thought:

“I’ll put something on so I don’t get bored.”

Second lie of the day.

You’re not “bored”.  
You’re bored **with yourself**. Different thing.

Instead of sitting with how you actually feel after waking up, you flood your brain with:

* news,
* podcasts,
* TikToks,
* someone else’s nightmare or fairytale.

Pick news? You get:

* a list of things to be scared of,
* a list of people to dislike,
* a list of crises you can’t do shit about.

Pick a “motivational” podcast? You get:

* a list of things you allegedly still lack,
* a list of mistakes you’re “definitely” making,
* a list of other people’s wins to beat yourself with.

Either way, when you get out of the car/bus, you’re already in:

“I have no control over the important stuff. I’m kinda too weak to change it.”

Congrats.  
You’re now primed to enter your day as **fuel**, not as a human with agency.

# 4. Work: the voluntary attention camp

You walk into work.

Out loud:

“It’s just a normal job, nothing crazy, not some big evil corpo.”

Come on.

Warehouse, office, shop, “family business” – doesn’t matter.  
The pattern is the same:

* targets,
* metrics,
* comparisons,
* someone above saying “we need more”.

Nobody tells you straight:

“Be afraid of getting fired.”

Instead you hear:

* “Market is tough.”
* “Competition is strong.”
* “Others manage with less.”

And inside, you auto-fill:

“If I don’t push, I’m disposable.  
If I’m not the best, I’m nobody.”

The system barely has to touch you.  
Once in a while it just:

* drops a leaderboard,
* hands out a “top performer” badge,
* praises a couple of stars.

You do the rest:

* you take extra hours nobody formally asked for,
* you answer emails at home “because someone has to”,
* you feel guilty for being sick.

Here’s the painful bit:

You’re not just a victim.  
You’re a very loyal employee of the machine.

What whips and chains used to do,  
you now do to yourself – cheaper, quieter, with a smiley face sticker.

# 5. Break: sharing fear like cigarettes

Break time.

Official version:

“I’ll go breathe, reset a bit.”

Actual version:

* complaining about prices,
* complaining about your boss,
* complaining about “those at the top”,
* complaining about “those at the bottom” (lazy ones, people on welfare, the rich – pick your villain).

Feels like a vent.  
Like you’re “letting it out”.

It’s not a vent.  
It’s **horizontal fear distribution**.

Instead of saying out loud:

“I’m scared they won’t afford / I’m scared they’ll fire me / I’m scared they’re screwing us,”

you all say:

* “People on benefits live better than us.”
* “Migrants are ruining everything.”
* “HQ has no idea what it’s like down here.”

The system can go make a coffee.

You’re doing the work:

* spreading fear,
* spreading resentment,
* spreading helplessness.

And not once do you ask:

“Who profits while we chew each other up?”

TV and “anti-system” folks love to tell you:

“Elites are terrified you’ll unite.”

Lol, no.

They know you don’t even need to touch hands.  
As long as you:

* hate together,
* compare together,
* doom-talk together,

it runs on its own.  
No supervision needed.

# 6. Shopping: the Church of “never enough”

Work’s done. Classic next step: store.

You’re not “entering the temple of consumerism”.  
You got baptized there long ago.

You walk between shelves.

And you get the same pattern as your morning feed:

* first: “you don’t have this”,
* then: “you really should have this”,
* finally: “if you don’t grab this deal now, you’re an idiot.”

Receipt will say “food, cleaning stuff, etc.”  
Reality: you’re buying:

* relief after the shitstorm at work,
* a band-aid for feeling “less than”,
* a tiny hit of “I’m on top of things, I did the responsible adult stuff”.

The killer here isn’t that your cart is full.

The killer is that you **stop seeing the links**:

* between your stress,
* your phone,
* your constant “hustle”,
* your purchases.

You’re basically a lab rat that can’t see the maze walls anymore  
because its face is buried in the bowl.

# 7. Evening: “switching off” = DIY lobotomy

You drag yourself home.

Brain goes:

“I just need to switch off.”

Spoiler:  
You’re not “switching off”.

You’re saying:

“Someone please turn my brain off for me.”

You open:

* a show,
* YouTube,
* TikTok,
* the news.

You want one thing: **to not feel your own day**.

What do you see?

* worlds way more fucked up than yours – so you think “ok, mine isn’t that bad”,
* worlds way more luxurious than yours – so you feel “I’ve got so far to go”,
* worlds way dumber than yours – so you can think “at least I’m smarter than those clowns”.

Every one of those comes with one subliminal message:

“Don’t stop. Don’t think. Keep scrolling. Keep buying.”

Important part:

The system is **not** scared you’ll suddenly “learn the truth”.

It’s scared of the **silence between stimuli**.

Because in that silence:

* you’d notice how you actually feel,
* you’d start hearing what *you* want, not what you’re told to want,
* questions would show up that don’t have a banner ad with an instant answer.

So you do whatever it takes to kill that silence.

Not “them”.  
**You.**

# 8. Night: anxiety as a blanket

You’re in bed.

“One more scroll.”  
“One more video.”  
“One more ‘world is burning’ article.”

Your body is dead tired. Eyes half-closed.  
Your brain is still sprinting on a treadmill.

It’s full of stuff you **have zero real influence over**:

* wars in places you can’t find on a map,
* financial crises no normal person actually understands,
* climate in the scale of a planet where your lightbulb is statistical dust.

And you do the one thing the system loves most:

You fall asleep with a **micro-dose of helplessness**.

Not with:

* “Here’s one tiny thing I’ll try tomorrow.”

Just with:

“It’s bad, it’ll get worse, I can’t do anything.”

And a person in that state is perfect next-day material for:

* clicking,
* buying,
* complying,
* “rebelling” online in ways that change absolutely nothing.

Again:

It’s not “them” tucking the phone into your bed.

You’re the one inviting the **control center of your own fear** under the covers.

# 9. Biggest plot twist: you’re not just a victim, you’re a co-author

If you’re now thinking:

“Okay smartass, so what, I should move to a forest, throw my phone in a lake and quit my job?”

Congrats, the system tuned you well.

It got you to see only two options:

1. be a cog,
2. or go full hermit and “leave society”.

Same trick as:

* TV vs “independent media”,
* mainstream vs “woke / redpilled / awakened”,
* “them” vs “us”.

The brick you’re supposed to take to the face here is:

90% of the time you’re not a victim of the system.  
90% of the time you’re free labour for it.

* You supply data by clicking.
* You supply emotions by reacting.
* You supply reach by sharing.
* You supply content by posting your takes, memes, hot opinions.

“System” is just a blob of:

* states,
* companies,
* media,
* churches,
* “anti-system” movements.

Different costumes, same fuel:

* your attention,
* your fear,
* your “never enough”.

# 10. Final hit: it’s not “them” holding the remote. You keep handing it to them.

Remember that image from the end of the book?  
Remote with no batteries.

Your whole life you can live with the line:

“They’ve got the remote to my life.”

Sounds heroic.  
You get to be a proud victim:

* “If it wasn’t for the media…”
* “If it wasn’t for the system…”
* “If it wasn’t for ads…”

The ugly version, no filter:

You’re the one handing them the remote.  
Day after day. Click after click.  
And you’re still doing it.

Every time you:

* beg for “just one more episode” instead of talking to an actual human,
* grab your phone instead of sitting five minutes with your own thoughts,
* guilt-trip others into “staying up to date” with whatever the machine is spewing,
* pass on fear you bought, like you’re doing free promo.

The system, by itself, doesn’t have the power to make you a slave  
if you’re not doing 90% of the work for it.

That’s supposed to sting.  
If it doesn’t, you’ll just run back to “it’s all their fault” and nothing changes.

This is not about hating yourself.  
It’s about **finally stopping the bullshit**.

If you’ve made it this far and you’re still reading,

that means:

* either you enjoy getting your brain sandpapered,
* or something in you is actually starting to crack open.

Both are fine.

What comes later in the book won’t be “5 steps to enlightenment” or a comfy system replacement.  
It’ll be:

* specific places where you screw yourself over,
* plus a few ugly, uncomfortable tools to **stop**.

For now, just hold one line:

You’re not only someone “they” scare.  
You’re also the one who agrees to be scared every day.

Until that sinks in,  
every theory – official or “hidden truth” –  
will just be a new brick you let someone throw at your head.",0,1764733585.0,wroteabook,0,0.5,False

1pctpxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Fit_Onion_5187/comments/1pctpxs/do_athome_led_masks_actually_do_anything/,Do at-home LED masks actually do anything?,"Fair question. Many people wonder whether these glowing sci-fi face mask are real skincare helpers or just fancy night-lights. What we can rely on is the science of wavelengths. Different colors of light have been studied for specific effects on the skin:

**Functions of different wavelengths**

* 630nm Red light: supports collagen production and helps rebuild that plump, bouncy structure we loved in our early 20s.
* 830nm Near-infrared: works deeper in the skin and is linked to improving firmness and resilience. Think of it as a workout your skin does without sweating.
* 415nm Blue light: targets acne-causing bacteria and helps reduce breakouts and irritated bumps.
* 590nm Yellow light: encourages skin metabolism and supports natural repair, similar to giving your cells a much-needed coffee boost.
* 525nm Green light: brightens overall skin tone and helps calm dullness and dark circles.

So yes, the key is consistent use and wavelengths that are actually proven to work, not just colorful LEDs for fun.

https://preview.redd.it/c5w9lhqqpw4g1.jpg?width=2294&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b80b1cc2a32c82b97661aa37b69e26fc83ddefe1

**Zone-specific care**

We’ve all been there: a bathroom shelf crowded with serums promising miracles, while that one expensive LED mask still blasts the same light across your very different skin zones. Some nights you want blue light to calm the breakout on your forehead. The next morning, the fine lines around your eyes demand red light. And by day three, your cheeks are begging for something soothing. If traditional devices were right, you’d need three different masks and three paychecks.

Enter Umitec S2, the first at-home LED mask that treats your face like the complex landscape it truly is. With five precisely calibrated wavelengths, it gives the forehead, eye area and cheeks their own treatment plans. LED beads are also embedded around the philtrum area, ensuring full-face coverage. Think of it as a personal skin coach adapting to your skin’s daily mood swings.

When choosing an LED mask, there are a few things that actually matter:

* Light wavelengths that target different skin concerns 
* A flexible design that fits closely and comfortably across the face

https://preview.redd.it/8qsjr9uupw4g1.jpg?width=938&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=873ec186e3950a96b418a0e58f9c9143b93dbce9

**Irradiance is the key**

Most home-use LED masks run at 1–10 mW/cm². Safe, but barely strong enough to shift your skin’s behavior. Umitec’s 123 LED beads and 615 high-density channels push energy up to five times stronger than typical consumer models. Green light reaches 50 mW/cm², blue light 25 mW/cm², which is a meaningful step up where results actually start to happen.

So a mask that truly works usually combines three essentials:

•A proven variety of wavelengths that offer precise care for different skin needs

•A comfortable fit that allows full and flexible coverage

•Most importantly, real clinical data that shows results beyond theory

Because glowing lights are easy. Results are what we are really after.

**Data speaks**

“We believe precision and science should always come together,” says Umitec’s R&D lead. The S2 has passed SGS testing. After 28 days, results include:

* 100% saw reduced melanin and improved brightness 90.63% experienced smoother skin
* 96.88% of participants saw a reduction in the number of under-eye wrinkles.
* 87.5% experienced a decrease in the overall area of under-eye wrinkles.

It’s an insanely hot hot sauce with lots of spicy pepper in it. Anyway I accidentally added too much sauce to the seeds and inhaled it while I was tossing it to mix it around. 

Right after this happened, I felt really nauseous. And then I continued to feel really nauseous for the next 8 months until I cut out coffee.

Tonight, he gets mad and while I’m in another room, I hear him in another room getting angry - either something was slammed on the counter or he slammed a cabinet I’m not sure. When I go in there he is SO MAD that she threw a coffee drink in our outside trash can with liquid in it and he GOT IT ON HIS HAND (emphasis because this is why he was actually mad). He was so angry that he had told her a 1000 times before not to do this (for at least the last few years he said). I then said that he needed to go up to her room and tell her that she shouldn’t do that and why (it leaks into the can, etc). He proceeded to tell me that I never take his side and he doesn’t understand why I only take the kids side. I’m concerned that his reactions are pushing her further and further away from him (and therefore us - we also have two elementary aged children).

Team Tidbits:

* The Patriots, nor any team, cannot clinch a spot in week 14. However, they are the first to receive the PRESTIGIOUS Playoff Computer ""Realistically IN"" designation. That and $4.95 will get you a small coffee at Starbucks.
* Believe it or not, the Broncos game against the lowly Raiders is close to a must-win. Lose, with a Packers, Jaguars, Chiefs, and Chargers finish, a 10-7 result is not out of the picture. And 10 wins is not all that safe this year.
* Watching Trevor for much of the year I dunno how the Jaguars got to #3. The AFC South could end up in a big tie jamboree with tiebreakers most interesting, Jaguars, Colts, and Texans all ending up tied with 1-1 H2H records and 4-2 division records is a possibility.
* Chargers O-Line issues now face Eagles, Chiefs, Cowboys, Texans, and Broncos. Beat Chiefs and Texans is their path to glory.
* Colts two game losing streak is in danger of quickly becoming a seven game collapse, finish with Jaguars, Seahawks, 49ers, Jaguars, Texans.
* Bills will likely limp in with games remaining against the Browns and Jets.
* The Texans are currently outside looking in, but have better mathematical chances than either of the AFC North leaders. A loss to the Chiefs, however, would put them back in the hole they just dug themselves out of.
* Ravens vs Steelers for division lead.
* Steelers vs Ravens for division lead.
* Chiefs, in week 14, do NOT control their own destiny. However, games against Texans and Chargers gives them about as good a chance as they could ask for to battle those in front of them.
* The Bengals, even with a loss to the Bills this week, would not be in the worst imaginable position. Have to hope the Ravens & Steelers split their series. And then win all the games.
* Dolphins not eliminated, but realistically out.
* Jets not eliminated, but realistically out.
* Browns not even eliminated from division contention, but realistically out.
* Raiders are eliminated.
* Titans are eliminated.

1pctinp,https://www.reddit.com/r/terf_trans_fight/comments/1pctinp/i_still_have_a_vision/,I still have a vision.,"I met Hamster at a time when I was trying to pull back from all of the trans things I was involved in. I'd met Kale over on HTG and for a while my real interest was hanging out with Kale and Hamster and a few others, but really just pulling back.

My goal in the early days on HTG when Kale and Hamster were around was just running polls. What do people really think. What could be learned from letting people tell their stories.

When Hamster invited me to moderate TTA I had a vision, and I think most of us - Hamster, me, Rabbit and Witchy - shared that same vision. A place where reasonable people on both sides could come together and reason.

Charitably, I think we had a bigger vision than our ability to realize it. Whenever we've gotten together and talked about that, our overall lack of having a clue usually comes out. Rabbit says that some day she's going to make coffee mugs about that early mod team. I think most of us want one of those mugs. Someone should also write a book about it.

The overall tone of the group was set very early on by a couple of posts, all of which now seem to have been deleted as many of the earliest participants have deleted their accounts and/or their posts. At first, the sub was very trans-dominated, but slowly over time a number of gender critical women, some of whom are still there, settled in and shifted the balance of the discourse.

A number of things - some good, some bad, some horrible - happened and TTA became what it is today. A space in which gender critical people are free to dehumanize trans people with utter impunity, so long as they are civil. It is also a space where a few trans sycophants are free to say whatever things they want in order to curry whatever favor they can curry, regardless of how true or valid or relevant it is.

I still have a vision.

In my day to day life I'm a woman who's well on the way through her life. I ponder retirement and old age and things like where I want to be buried when I'm dead. I worry more about how much I have in retirement savings and what health problems are going to get worse in old age than ""do I pass?"", or ""should I change in the women's locker room?"" Because I do pass, and I do change in the women's locker room, and I am at the age where more and more of my friends and family are dying from old age.

My vision is simple.

I want people to know what kinds of issues are facing reasonable transsexuals of both sexes, and I want people to know what kinds of legitimate concerns are on the minds of folks might identify as gender critical.

I want people to be able to discuss both with honesty and integrity, and while behaving in a civil and respectful manner. Being civil while dehumanizing others is not civility. Being dishonest to try and score point is not integrity. As I wrote earlier today, slurs won't be tolerated. Dehumanizing comments, no matter how clever and witty they are, won't be tolerated either. A lot of us, myself included, had a lot of fun trolling people. And the traffic statistics for this sub bear it all out - no one even comes here anymore.

I think that we - and we still have more of the original TTA mod team than TTA has - had to go through what we went through to realize what we've all done wrong. I've used ""TERF"" entirely too much, and there are folks in TTA who think ""TIM"" and ""TIF"" are perfectly fine terms because they get to avoid calling trans women men, and trans men women, and just behaving badly, and those people sometimes stroll in here with that behavior.

This will work or it won't.

I think the current mod team mostly still has a vision. I think a lot of us have been humbled by the experience, and I think we've begun to learn what does and doesn't work.",2,1764732692.0,terf_trans_fight,0,0.75,False

**Subtitle:** You survived Thanksgiving dinner with him. Now, how do you survive Monday morning?

If you are reading this, you likely just survived Thanksgiving.

You sat at a table with family. You ate too much. And, inevitably, you had to deal with *that* uncle. You know the one. He has strong opinions, he doesn't listen to anyone else, and he thinks things were better ""back in his day."" You tolerate him because, well, he’s family.

But for many shop owners, this isn't a once-a-year occurrence. You have to deal with this guy every single morning at 7:00 AM.

Every machine shop has a ""Crazy Uncle.""

He’s the guy on the manual lathe who can hold a tenth with a file and a piece of sandpaper. He knows the feeds and speeds for Inconel by smell. He has tools in his box that haven't been manufactured since the Carter administration.

He is a machining genius. **He is also a management nightmare.**

He refuses to use the new tablets for data collection (""I'm a machinist, not a typist""). He hoards the good inserts in a locked drawer. And if you dare put a Gen Z apprentice next to him, he eats the kid alive before the first coffee break.

I spent 25 years on the floor and 10 years in leadership. I have hired these guys, fired these guys, and—on my cranky days—I have *been* this guy.

Here is the truth: **You cannot build a scalable business on the back of a curmudgeon, no matter how talented he is.**

So, how do you handle the ""Crazy Uncle"" without losing the tribal knowledge he holds?



# 1. Understand the Fear Behind the Grumpiness



The ""Crazy Uncle"" isn't usually angry; he’s scared.

He sees the 5-axis robots coming in. He sees the young kids programming with Mastercam while he’s still doing trig on a grease-stained notepad. He feels his relevance slipping away. His hoarding of knowledge isn't malice; it’s his insurance policy. He thinks, *""If I'm the only one who knows how to run this part, they can't fire me.""*

**The Fix:** You need to change his currency. Stop praising him for being the ""only one who can do it."" Start praising him for **teaching others how to do it.**



# 2. The ""Legacy"" Pitch



You can’t force these guys to train apprentices. If you say, ""Train this kid,"" they hear, ""Train your replacement so we can dump you.""

Instead, appeal to their ego (which is usually massive).

Try this: *""Miller, look at this new kid. He’s going to crash that machine in ten minutes. He doesn’t have the hands for this. I need you to show him how a real machinist does it. I don't trust anyone else to teach him the right way.""*

Don't frame it as training. Frame it as preventing the ""new generation"" from ruining his shop. He won’t do it for the company, but he might do it to prove he’s the smartest guy in the room.



# 3. Build a ""Technology Bridge""



If your ""Crazy Uncle"" is excellent at making chips but terrible at ERP entry, stop trying to force a square peg into a digital hole.

I’ve seen shops lose their best toolmaker because the owner insisted he log every minute into an iPad. Is that really the hill you want to die on?

**The Fix:** Pair him with a younger ""Digital Translator."" The veteran determines the process and cuts the metal; the apprentice handles the data entry and the tablet work. The veteran feels respected for his skill, and the apprentice gets to watch a master at work.



# 4. The Nuclear Option (When He Has to Go)



Here is the hard part.

Sometimes, the ""Crazy Uncle"" is just toxic. If he is actively sabotaging new hires, refusing to follow safety protocols, or creating a culture where people hate coming to work, **he is costing you more than he makes you.**

I don’t care if he’s the only one who can run the horizontal mill. If he creates a toxic environment, your turnover costs will bankrupt you faster than a missed deadline.

You have to be willing to look him in the eye and say: *""Your skill is incredible, but your attitude is killing this team. I need both, or I need neither.""*



# The Leftovers



As you head back to the shop next week, take a look at your ""Crazy Uncle.""

Is he a relic holding you back, or is he a library of knowledge waiting to be unlocked? The difference isn't usually in his skill—it’s in your leadership.

Happy Thanksgiving. Now, go clean up that shop.

**Who is the ""Crazy Uncle"" in your shop? (Don’t name names... we all know who they are!) Tell me your best war story in the comments.**

It finally worked out that I went by the coffee shop today that she likes to work from. When I pulled in I saw her car and my heart almost jumped out of my chest. When I walked inside there she was as beautiful as the last time I’d seen her. She sat against the wall as I ordered I tried to not make it so obvious that I was staring at her. But after getting my coffee I walked over and saw her smile again. I’ve missed seeing her smile. We sat and talked for a few hours while she worked. I mostly pretended to work. But for the first hour my hands shook as bad as the first time I met her. Being in her presence is so intimating yet calming at the same time. My entire adult life my job has put me in harms way but I have never been as nervous as I am when I’m with her. She’s the most beautiful woman I could have ever imagined. Not just her physical appearance but her soul is breath taking. Both of our current circumstances make it so we can’t really talk or see each other often but being with her today only for a few hours has brought me so much happiness. I long for the next time we can run into each other again or the day when everything aligns and we can take that next step. Until then I will miss her and always be thinking about her.

1pctavq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1pctavq/phone_addiction_became_pc_addiction/,Phone Addiction Became PC Addiction + Procrastinating Personal Project,"Looking for advice for improving PC (social media/porn) addiction and Reducing Procrastination on my personal project.

I have been using a dumb Phone for over two years now which significantly reduced my screen time. Whenever I have a free day I like to go for long walks, often leaving my phone behind, and dont feel any anxiety or lack. I do often browse social media in the evenings on my PC. My PC usage is mostly Youtube, Instagram, and Porn (in order of most to least time).

I have recently graduated, and my screen time has increased almost to where it was before the dumb phone. I generally get out of bed and go straight onto youtube. This habit is partially because I have no schedule, and partially as a way to procrastinate/avoid my personal project.

To help this issue I moved my PC out of my bedroom into the lounge where all my flatmates can see what I am doing. This worked for a few weeks until I got comfortable letting them see me waste time.

My project which I want to work on is an youtube interview project where I talk to strangers in the park. I did one interview for this project 2 weeks ago, and have done many similar projects over the past 5 years. The primary drive behind this project is to improve my conversational skills and become more procative at meeting new people and talking to people I already know, instead of relying on others to initiate. I also do sometimes enjoy the experience when the nerves subside.

When I worked on these projects in the past, I believed that one or two big experiences of facing my fear of rejection would ""fix"" my social anxiety and it would all become easy from then on. I realise now that I actually need more regular experiences to grow and sustain long term change.

My first project was shortly after covid where I interview strangers for about 5-15 minutes about their dating experience (or lack of) during covid. The first time I walked around for 2 hours and interviewed one young guy. 2 weeks later I talked to 3 people in 2 hours. By the 5th or sixth session I asked everyone who I walked past, somewhere between 10 and 20 people in 1 hour (I'm including people that said they werent interested in talking). After that experience I felt like I had overcome my anxiety, and also like I needed a new interview topic but I never got around to it, and didnt do anything regularly since then. That was a few years ago and I feel like I have backtracked with only minimal progress. Which makes sense because I faced my fear on only five or six occasions.

In my new project I talk to strangers in a relatively unstructured manner, with only a few inciting questions for 20mins to 1 hour. I did my first interview about 2 weeks ago. Curently I have 2 months until I start full time work, which is a great opportunity to work on this project regularly and really develop some momentum. But that is where the internet distraction comes in.

I am usually on my PC first thing in the morning, or I walk for an hour or two and get a coffee, then go on my PC when I get back. I also stay up late, ruin my sleep and feel tired a lot of the time. My main excuse for not doing these interviews is that I feel too tired to do a good job.

I have some shame for my lack of social skills as a 26 year old man. I am afraid of rejection and of exposing my lack of social skills. It is my understanding that these are probably the feelings that I am avoiding by distracting myself with social media and porn. A few months ago I completely stopped all social media and porn usage for about 2 weeks and I started to feel overwhelemd with feelings of loneliness and grief, and realised that there is almost nothing I look forward to in my life.

So I can see two aspects which I could adress: Emotional Barriers, And prevention or reduction of access to distractions. I was seeing a therapist but stopped recently due to my financial situation. For adressing emotions on my own, I feel like doing these interviews is an effective form of exposure therapy, and I'm not sure what else to do to supplement that. For reducing distractions, I could lock my PC away for a week or two (this is only a short term solution but might help me develop some momentum).

In my previous flat I kept my PC in a seperate cupboard and treated it like an office. This made my usage much more focused. Unfortunately I dont have any spare spaces at my current flat, just the bedroom and lounge.

If anyone has any advice on reducing the emotional barrier, or an effective way to limit access to your PC without making it completely useless for essential tasks such as checking emails, writing invoices or video editing then please let me know.",2,1764732088.0,Healthygamergg,3,1.0,False

Fast-forward to one month ago I decided to message her to see if I could get to know her over some coffee. I got a response back about a week later saying “yea I think I’d like that” I didn’t see her reply the night she sent it so I replied the next morning trying to set up the date “Sweet! How does tomorrow sound?”( looking back, I think I did bad job setting up the date with that text) I didn’t get a text back. Over the course of November I messaged her three more times seeing about the date and left it open ended to let her know I was still interested and for her to get back to me if she still is. 

Today is December 2nd and I was just scrolling on Facebook and was looking through the people you may know section. I saw her page. I clicked on it and looked through it a little bit. I went back as far as September of this year. When I was swiping off of her page, I accidentally doubled tapped the picture liking it. At this point, I only have two options either A: unlike it and try to act like it didn’t happen 
B: double down and add her on Facebook
I chose option B because I am interested in her, so I might as well own up. I Also thought she looked incredible in that picture. I just wish I didn’t like the picture under the circumstance. And I wouldn’t dare message her again considering I’ve messaged her too much as it is. Any advice?

TL DR: Matched with a girl a few years ago, it didn’t go anywhere. Asked her on a date again she said yeah but never replied after that. Accidentally liked an old post on her fb and decided added her on fb after the fact.

1pct7b3,https://i.redd.it/a552dkglpw4g1.png,"The Rejected ""Barren"" Luna","Genevieve's Story 1

Hailey Hayes stood before me in the living room of the Alpha's mansion, her hand resting protectively over her slightly swollen belly. Her eyes held a challenge, burning with arrogance.

""If you know what's good for you, you'll leave the Pack on your own. Alpha Preston loves me, not you, you barren, useless Omega.""

My wolf bristled at the insult, pacing restlessly in my mind. She wanted to bare her teeth, to tear into this insolent she-wolf who dared to challenge a Luna.

But I forced her down. I had spent years suppressing my aura, hiding my Lycan bloodline to fit into Preston's world.

""I've heard the name Hailey before,"" I said calmly, though my wolf growled low in my chest.

She was a rogue Preston had picked up half a year ago. He claimed she was a pitiful stray with potential, hiring her as an assistant in the Pack administration.

Rumors had swirled through the mind-links of the pack members, but I had trusted the mate bond. I trusted Preston's wolf.

I never expected a rogue to walk into the Alpha's mansion and demand the Luna's position.

""A common rogue doesn't become a Luna just by leaving the wilds,"" I said, my voice cold.

She wasn't worthy of being considered a rival.

I didn't bother arguing. Instead, I opened the mind-link.

""Alpha Preston. Come home.""

I severed the link and looked at Hailey.""Preston will be here any minute. Let him make his choice before the Moon Goddess. If he chooses you, I'll walk away. How about that?""

""Heh,"" she sneered.""I gave you a chance for a graceful exit, but you just had to humiliate yourself. Fine. Just wait until the Alpha gets back. Don't come crying to me when you become a rogue.""

I offered a small smile, keeping my thoughts to myself.

Half an hour later, the heavy oak door slammed open. Preston walked in, his Alpha aura flaring with irritation.

Hailey turned to him immediately, her voice dripping with syrup.""Preston,"" she purred, clinging to his arm.""She said if you choose me, she'll walk away. Just tell her, who do you pick?""

I turned my gaze to Preston. I trusted our history. Thirteen years of companionship.

I knew exactly what his choice would be.

But in the very next moment, Preston threw a document onto the coffee table.

""Just sign the rejection papers,"" he said coldly.

The smile on my face froze. My heart skipped a beat, and then plummeted.

""Rejection?"" I whispered.

""I, Alpha Preston Vance, reject you, Genevieve , as my mate and Luna,"" he stated, his voice devoid of emotion.

The pain of the broken bond snapped through me like a physical whip. My wolf let out a high-pitched whine of agony, curling into a ball in the back of my mind.

I looked at the papers. It wasn't just a rejection; it was an expulsion order.

""You expect me to leave the Pack with nothing?"" I asked, my voice trembling.""After everything I've done for this Pack?""

""You betray our mate bond, then you want to keep all the assets?"" I asked, disbelief coloring my tone.""Preston, do you think I'm a pushover?""

Hailey smirked, leaning into him.""What, suddenly you're an independent she-wolf? For years you've eaten Preston's food, lived in the Alpha's mansion. Now you want to split assets? Don't you have any shame?""

""Did anyone ask you, rogue?"" I snapped.

""Preston!"" Hailey whined.""She's being mean to me! Kick her out!""

Preston's hand caressed Hailey's cheek, a gesture once reserved for me. My stomach churned.

He looked at me with cold, empty eyes.""Hailey is right. You are a barren Omega. The Pack needs an heir. As for the years I supported you, I won't demand repayment. Just sign the agreement and leave my Pack.""

Bullshit facts.

My gaze locked onto his.""Swear on your wolf and repeat those words.""

""We're done, Genevieve . Sign it.""

Rage surged, hot and blinding.

I snatched the papers, crumpled them into a ball, and hurled them at his face.""Oh, we're finished alright. But you're the one who will walk away with nothing.""

My wolf stood up, shaking off the pain, ready for war.

""My lawyer—and the Council—will be in touch.""

I spun on my heel, refusing to let them see the tears threatening to fall.

Just as I reached the door, a voice boomed from the hallway.""Preston, what in the Moon Goddess's name are you playing at?""

Most “how to make a girl like you” advice out there is either sleazy red pill nonsense or generic fluff like “be confident” or “make her laugh.” I’m over it. You’re probably over it too. Yet tons of people keep blindly recycling this stuff on TikTok, Instagram, and low-tier YouTube dating channels. 

But here’s the thing. Attraction isn’t magic. It’s not completely random. Psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral science have been studying human connection for decades. And good news? There are proven psychological tricks that actually influence attraction ,  and nope, none of them require being 6’4” or a millionaire.

So I dug into the real research, books, and expert insights from behavioral science, evolutionary psychology, and social dynamics ,  and gathered 10 psychological tricks (plus some bonus resources) that are subtle, powerful, and actually work.

Let’s break them down.

---

*1. Use the “chameleon effect” ,  mirror her energy, speech, and body language*

  - People are naturally drawn to those who subtly reflect their behavior. This is called the Chameleon Effect, and it’s been studied in depth by psychologists Tanya Chartrand and John Bargh.
  - If she talks fast, match her tempo. If she gestures while talking, do the same. If she leans forward during conversation, mirror it after a few seconds. Keep it subtle or it'll get creepy.

*2. Familiarity breeds... attraction*

  - The exposure effect is real. Studies by Zajonc in the 1960s show that the more someone is exposed to a stimulus, the more they tend to like it. Translation: just being around her ,  in a class, friend group, gym, etc ,  increases your chances.
  - Regular, brief interactions > one long deep convo. Quantity of exposure actually matters.

*3. Show vulnerability ,  but don’t trauma dump*

  - According to Dr. Arthur Aron, the intimacy-building 36 Questions study showed that revealing small, personal things builds strong emotional connection fast.
  - The trick is to share something slightly vulnerable ,  like a fear, a childhood dream, or a struggle you overcame. Vulnerability signals emotional maturity and confidence.

*4. Activate the “reward system” with unpredictability*

  - Neuropsychologist Lucy L. Brown explains in the podcast Speaking of Psychology that dopamine surges when people experience unexpected rewards. That’s why inconsistent texting or hard-to-get behavior can sometimes work ,  not because you’re being a jerk, but because it mimics variable reward patterns.
  - Switch things up: text at different times, suggest an unexpected fun activity, or surprise her by remembering little details.

*5. Build “us vs the world” moments*

  - Shared experiences ,  especially novel or slightly challenging ones ,  forge intense connections. Think escape rooms, spontaneous road trips, deep convos about controversial topics.
  - Psychologist Aron again found that couples who did exciting activities together reported higher satisfaction. So ditch basic coffee dates for something that bonds you both.

*6. Strong eye contact triggers deep emotional syncing*

  - According to Harvard research and Dr. Helen Fisher’s studies on attraction, mutual eye contact increases feelings of closeness and romantic intensity.
  - Tip: during a conversation, hold eye contact about 60–70% of the time ,  especially when she’s speaking. Don’t stare like a robot. Make it warm, not intense.

*7. Ask self-expansion questions ,  not boring small talk*

  - Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology says people feel more drawn to those who help them grow and explore new aspects of themselves.
  - Instead of asking “what do you do?” try “if you could wake up anywhere tomorrow, where would you go?” or “what’s something you’ve always wanted to learn but felt scared to try?”

*8. Subtle touch is insanely powerful*

  - Studies show that even light touches (walking past, passing something, brief hand contact) increase perception of warmth and attraction.
  - Social psychologist Nicolas Guéguen ran multiple experiments proving that brief physical contact during conversation or while joking increases likability ,  especially when perceived as natural.

*9. Ask for her opinion or advice*

  - When you ask someone for help or input (“Hey I’m trying to figure out what to get my niece... any ideas?”), it subtly triggers the Ben Franklin Effect ,  people like those they do small favors for.
  - It also makes her feel valued and smart. Triple win.

*10. Be seen being liked by others*

  - Social proof works. When she sees you interacting positively with friends, being respected by others, or even being around other women (platonically), it changes your social status in her mind.
  - A 2009 study published in Evolution and Human Behavior found that men were rated as more attractive by women when they were shown surrounded by other smiling women.

Use these tricks wisely. Don’t fake who you are. These are tools to enhance real connection, not manipulation tactics. A lot of attraction is subconscious, but it can absolutely be influenced ,  and understanding the psychology behind it is how you stop guessing and start getting real results.

Let me know what’s worked for you. Or what backfired. This stuff is messy, but there’s real science behind it if you know where to look.

It was founded on February 22, 1987 by Chris Wedge, Michael Ferraro, Carl Ludwig, Alison Brown, David Brown, and Eugene Troubetzkoy after their employer, MAGI, one of the visual effects studios behind the 1982 Disney film Tron, shut down. Using its in-house rendering software, the studio created visual effects for commercials and films before dedicating itself to animated film production. It produced 13 feature films, the first being Ice Age, released in March 15, 2002 by 20th Century Fox (Now called 20th Century Studios), and the final one being Spies in Disguise, released in December 25, 2019.

Blue Sky Studios was a subsidiary of 20th Century Animation until its acquisition by Disney, as part of their acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets in March 20, 2019. Blue Sky was shut down in April 10, 2021 by Disney due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business operations.

Ice Age and Rio were the studio's most commercially successful franchises, while Robots (2005), Horton Hears a Who! (2008), The Peanuts Movie (2015), and the aforementioned Spies in Disguise were among its most critically praised films. Scrat, a character from the Ice Age franchise, was the studio's mascot.

In the late 1970s, Chris Wedge, then an undergraduate at Purchase College studying film, was employed by Mathematical Applications Group, Inc. (MAGI). MAGI was an early computer technology company which produced SynthaVision, a software application that could replicate the laws of physics to measure nuclear radiation rays for U.S. government contracts.  At MAGI, Wedge met Eugene Troubetzkoy, who held a Ph.D in theoretical physics and was one of the first computer animators. Using his background in character animation, Wedge helped MAGI produce animation for television commercials, which eventually led to an offer from Walt Disney Productions to produce animation for the film Tron (1982). After Tron, MAGI hired Carl Ludwig, an electrical engineer,  and Mike Ferraro transferred to the film division from the Cad Cam division of MAGI. As MAGI's success began to decline, the company employed David Brown from CBS/Fox Video to be a marketing executive and Alison Brown to be a managing producer. After MAGI was sold to Vidmax (Canada), the six individuals—Wedge, Troubetzkoy, Ferraro, Ludwig, David Brown, and Alison Brown—founded Blue Sky Studios in February 1987 to continue the software design and produce computer animation.

At Blue Sky, Ferraro and Ludwig expanded on CGI Studio, the studio programming language they started at MAGI and began using it for animation production.\[  At the time, scanline renderers were prevalent in the computer graphics industry, and they required computer animators and digital artists to add lighting effects in manually;  Troubetzkoy and Ludwig adapted MAGI's ray tracing, algorithms which simulate the physical properties of light in order to produce lighting effects automatically.  To accomplish this, Ludwig examined how light passes through water, ice, and crystal, and programmed those properties into the software. Following the stock market crash of 1987, Blue Sky Studios did not find their first client until about two years later: a company ""that wanted their logo animated so it would be seen flying over the ocean in front of a sunset.""  In order to receive the commission, Blue Sky spent two days rendering a single frame and submitted it to the prospective client. However, once the client accepted their offer, Blue Sky found that they could not produce the entire animation in time without help from a local graphics studio, which provided them with extra computer processors.

Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, Blue Sky Studios concentrated on the production of television commercials and visual effects for film. The studio began by animating commercials that depicted the mechanisms of time-release capsules for pharmaceutical corporations. The studio also produced a Chock Full O' Nuts commercial with a talking coffee bean and developed the first computer-animated M&M's.  Using CGI Studio, the studio produced over 200 other commercials for clients such as Chrysler, General Foods, Texaco, Pepsi, and the United States Marines. They made a cartoon bumper for Nicktoons that features an orange blob making a dolphin, a dinosaur, and a walking person.

In 1996, MTV collaborated with Blue Sky Studios on the film Joe's Apartment, for which Blue Sky animated the insect characters. Other clients included Bell Atlantic, Rayovac, Gillette and Braun.  The Braun commercial was awarded a CLIO Award for Advertising.  Recalling the award, Carl Ludwig stated that the judges had initially mistaken the commercial as a live action submission as a result of the photorealism of the computer-animated razor. In August 1997, 20th Century Fox's Los Angeles-based visual effects company, VIFX, acquired majority interest in Blue Sky Studios to form a new visual effects and animation company, temporarily renamed ""Blue Sky/VIFX"".\] Following the studio's expansion, Blue Sky produced character animation for the films Alien Resurrection (1997), A Simple Wish (1997), Mouse Hunt (1997), Star Trek: Insurrection (1998) and Fight Club (1999).

Meanwhile, starting in 1990, Chris Wedge had been working on a short film named Bunny, intended to demonstrate CGI Studio. The film revolves around a rabbit widow who is irritated by a moth. The moth subsequently leads the rabbit into ""a heavenly glow, reuniting her with her husband.""  At the time, Wedge had been the thesis advisor for Carlos Saldanha while Saldanha was a graduate student at the School of Visual Arts; Wedge shared storyboard panels for Bunny with Saldanha during this time. After Saldanha's graduation, Blue Sky Studios hired him as an animator, and he later directed a few commercials. It was not until 1996 when Nina Rappaport, a producer at Blue Sky Studios, assigned Wedge to complete the Bunny project, which required CGI Studio to render fur, glass, and metal from multiple light sources, such as a swinging light bulb and an ""ethereal cloudscape"". In the initial stages of the Bunny project, Carl Ludwig modified CGI Studio to simulate radiosity, which tracks light rays as they reflect off of multiple surfaces. Blue Sky Studios released Bunny in 1998, and it received the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Bunny's success gave Blue Sky Studios the opportunity to produce feature-length films.

In March 1999, Fox decided to sell VIFX to another visual effects house, Rhythm & Hues Studios, while Blue Sky Studios would remain under Fox. According to Chris Wedge, Fox considered selling Blue Sky as well by 2000 due to financial difficulties in the visual effects industry in general. Instead, Wedge, film producer Lori Forte, and animation executive Chris Meledandri presented Fox with a script for a comedy feature film titled Ice Age. Studio management pressured staff to sell their remaining shares and options to Fox on the promise of continued employment on feature-length films. The studio moved to White Plains NY and started production on Ice Age. As the film wrapped, Fox feared that it might bomb at the box office. They terminated half of the production staff and tried unsuccessfully to find a buyer for the film and the studio.\[citation needed\] Instead, Ice Age was released by 20th Century Fox on March 15, 2002, and was a critical and commercial success, receiving a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards in 2003. The film established Blue Sky as the third studio, after Pixar and DreamWorks Animation, to launch a successful CGI franchise.

In January 2009, the studio moved from White Plains, New York to Greenwich, Connecticut, taking advantage of the state's 30 percent tax credit and having more space to grow. The studio stated in April 2017 that it intended to stay in Connecticut until 2025.

In 2013, Chris Wedge took a leave of absence to direct Paramount Animation's live-action/computer-animated film Monster Trucks. He then returned to Blue Sky Studios and worked on multiple projects for the company, such as serving as an executive producer.

Ownership of Blue Sky Studios was assumed by The Walt Disney Company as part of their 2019 acquisition of 21st Century Fox, which concluded on March 20, 2019. On March 21, Disney announced that Blue Sky Studios and its parent company 20th Century Fox Animation (now 20th Century Animation) would be integrated as units within the Walt Disney Studios with co-presidents Andrea Miloro and Robert Baird continuing to lead the studio, while reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn. In July 2019, Miloro announced that she would be stepping down from her role as co-president, thus leaving Baird as sole president.

In August 2019, former Walt Disney Animation Studios head Andrew Millstein was named as co-president of Blue Sky Studios alongside Baird, while Pixar Animation Studios president Jim Morris would also be taking a supervising role.

Spies in Disguise was released by 20th Century Fox on December 25, 2019. It ended up as the final feature film released under the Blue Sky name, and the only feature film produced by Blue Sky that Disney released.

The most recent Blue Sky Studios film, ""Spies In Disguise"" has made over $171 million in the pandemic period. And this is the time, when almost no one visited Cinemas because of the pandemic.

On February 9, 2021, Disney announced that it was closing Blue Sky Studios in April 2021. A spokesperson for the company explained that in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic's continued economic impact on all of its businesses, it was no longer sustainable for them to run a third feature animation studio. In addition, production on a film adaptation of the webcomic Nimona, originally scheduled to be released on January 14, 2022, was also cancelled as a result of its closure. The studio's film library and intellectual properties are retained by Disney. Although Disney did not give an exact date as to when the studio would be closing down initially, former animator Rick Fournier confirmed on April 10 it was their last day of operation, three days after co-founder Chris Wedge released a farewell letter on social media.

As of June 19, 2021, Blue Sky Studios' website now redirects to Disney.com.

On May 4, 2021, fan site Disney Television Animation News reported that it was rumored that a short series produced by Blue Sky known as Scrat Tales would be coming to Disney+. The series would follow the titular Scrat, who discovers that he has a son. Footage of the series was later leaked onto YouTube, with former Blue Sky animators revealing that the series would be coming to Disney+ in 2022 after The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild. On February 22, 2022, Disney officially announced the series, with a release date for April 13, 2022.

A sixth film in the Ice Age franchise, titled The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild, was produced by Walt Disney Pictures, and without the involvement of Blue Sky Studios. Although Blue Sky was not involved with the film before closure, the film was originally produced by 20th Century Studios and 20th Century Animation before being moved to Walt Disney Pictures during production for unknown reasons. It was animated by Canadian animation studio Bardel Entertainment and was released on Disney+ on January 28, 2022 to negative reception.

Additionally, in January 2022, a third film in the Rio franchise was revealed to be in development for Disney+.

Days after the release of The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild, it was reported that Disney had lost the rights of Scrat to fashion designer and artist Ivy Supersonic. She was said to have originally created Scrat under the name ""Sqrat"" and pitched the character to Fox, only to get turned down by the studio. Supersonic claims the studio's own documents actually identified the character in Ice Age as ""Sqrat"", though her creation was not saber-toothed. Supersonic was offered a $300,000 settlement by Fox, but she turned it down and subsequently lost in court. The case later went to appeal (Case # 04401 Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, NYC). Supersonic still had hopes of receiving damages for her claimed infringement, later winning a partial summary judgment from the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in a reverse suit, Fox Entertainment Group and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation v. Ivy Silberstein (her real name), in which Fox had tried to prevent her from registering the trademark ""SQRAT"". Rumors originally circulated in 2020 that Disney lost the rights to the character following the trademark dispute and later circulated as Scrat was not featured in The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild. However, after the unveiling of Scrat Tales, it was revealed that Disney did not lose the rights to Scrat.\[citation needed\]

In March 2022, amid the controversy of Disney's involvement in Florida House Bill 1557, referred to by some as the Don't Say Gay bill, and lack of criticism from CEO Bob Chapek until after the bill had passed, Insider reported that three former Blue Sky staff members stated Nimona received pushback from Disney leadership in mid-2020, centered around the film's LGBT themes and a same-sex kiss. Initially, Blue Sky leadership removed the same-sex kiss from ""presentations to Disney, despite hoping to ultimately include it in the film, the sources said. \[...\] Blue Sky leadership eventually showed reels to staffers that included the kiss, the sources said, but the studio was shut down soon after"". Nimona was picked up by Annapurna Pictures on April 11, 2022, with DNEG Animation taking over production, for release on Netflix on June 30, 2023.

Ice Age: Scrat Tales, the last official Blue Sky production, was released as scheduled on April 13, 2022. The final episode of the series, ""Nut The End"", concluded its ending credits with a parting message from the company:

Scrat was the first character to appear in Blue Sky's first movie, ""Ice Age"".  
Like him, we were reaching for something that might have been unattainable.  
Yet time after time both we and Scrat have managed to  
get our arms around versions of that elusive acorn.Unfortunately it's not possible to hold on to anything forever. We've had more fun bringing our movies to life than anyone should be allowed.  
We hope you've been able to feel some of that joy. Thank you, from the bottom of our Blue Sky collective hearts,  
for being with us all those years.

On the same day, a short video was uploaded to YouTube by an unlisted channel known as Finale, titled ""The End"", which featured Scrat finally capturing his acorn and eating it before scurrying away. The description revealed this was the final piece of animation made by Blue Sky Studios, done in their final days of operation by a small team of artists as ""a farewell, a send-off, on our own terms.""

Blue Sky Studios has a great potential for future films such as Rio 3, Anubis, Mutts, Oh My Gods, Foster, Confessions of an Imaginary Friend, and much more!

This sub has shown me how little I know about coffee, despite drinking 400ml or so every day for years now.


 I started with an entry level French press and moved to Borosil brew drip coffee maker a year ago. No complaints, and I love the convenience, but I'm curious about what would be the next natural progression. Also, if there's something I can do better with the existing equipment.


I've been using Blue Tokai/Third Wave beans to make standard black coffee (the coffee maker is automatic, don't think there are any variable settings other than quantity of water/ground coffee).

1pcszli,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipsOver35/comments/1pcszli/need_advice_on_reading_a_situation_at_my_group/,Need advice on reading a situation at my group fitness gym,"I (mid-30s M) was paired with a woman during a partner workout at my group fitness gym today, and I want to know if I’m overthinking everything.

We introduced ourselves at the start (I’ll call her S). Throughout the workout we talked briefly about dumbbells, the exercises, normal stuff. Before the last set, I asked how the workout was going and she told me which exercise she didn’t like. Just small, normal talk.

At the end of class I re-introduced myself, she told me she’s been coming since September, she lives nearby, and she likes that the gym uses weights instead of being all cardio. She also actually encouraged me to continue talking when I accidentally cut myself off because I got self-conscious (“No no, tell me… please go on”). That felt like a positive sign.

After class, she was standing near the exit waiting for space because people store their stuff there. I said “Have a nice evening,” held the door, and walked out. She followed shortly after. Nothing unusual.

Here’s where I might be overthinking:  
When at the exit, I can’t tell if she was just tired and neutral after the workout (totally normal), or if she was actually open to talking more and I missed the moment. I didn’t want to come across as a creep or someone hitting on women at the gym, so I kept it very normal.

The truth is, she seemed polite, comfortable, and even encouraging during the workout. But after class she had a neutral expression, so I couldn’t read if she was interested in more conversation or just zoning out like anyone would after an intense workout.

**My questions:**

1. Am I reading too much into a completely normal interaction?
2. Next time I see her, would it be weird to say something simple like “Hey S, good to see you again,” chat for a minute, and then ask if she’d want to grab a quick coffee after class sometime?
3. For women who do group fitness classes — would that feel creepy or unwelcome if done respectfully?

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

# Discover key players in vegan industry.

In the dynamic world of the vegan industry, several key players stand out for their innovative contributions and market influence. You might want to explore companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, which have redefined the landscape of plant-based proteins with their groundbreaking meat alternatives. Their focus on replicating the taste and texture of animal products has attracted a diverse consumer base, making plant-based diets more accessible and appealing. Additionally, brands such as Oatly and Tofurky are pivotal in the dairy and staple food segments, pushing the envelope on how we perceive traditional food categories through a vegan lens.

It’s also important to consider emerging brands and startups that are gaining traction, as they often bring fresh ideas and unique products to the scene. Keeping an eye on these players will not only enhance your knowledge of the industry but also help you make informed choices as a consumer in the growing plant-based space.

# Identify popular plant-based food trends.

One significant trend you’re likely to notice is the rise of whole-food plant-based diets, which emphasize the consumption of unprocessed or minimally processed foods. This approach encourages you to embrace a variety of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, and seeds, focusing on nutrition and health benefits while reducing reliance on heavily processed substitutes. Additionally, you may find an increasing popularity of plant-based seafood alternatives, as companies innovate to create products that replicate the flavors and textures of fish and other marine foods, appealing to both vegans and those looking to reduce their environmental impact.

Another noteworthy trend is the incorporation of global flavors and ingredients into plant-based dishes. You might explore exciting culinary offerings inspired by diverse cuisines, such as Indian-inspired lentil dishes, Mexican jackfruit tacos, or Mediterranean falafel wraps. This fusion not only makes plant-based eating more exciting but also showcases how versatile and flavorful these options can be. As this trend continues to grow, you’ll find that plant-based cuisine is becoming a vibrant part of mainstream dining, breaking down barriers and expanding the palate of both vegans and non-vegans alike.

# Learn about sustainable sourcing practices.

This not only benefits the planet but also ensures that the ingredients you use in your cooking are of high quality and flavor, enhancing the overall dining experience.

As you delve deeper into vegan cooking, exploring local farmers’ markets and sourcing seasonal produce can help you connect with your community while minimizing your carbon footprint. Understanding the importance of transparency in food supply chains can empower you to make informed choices about the ingredients you use.

Understanding the role of key ingredients — such as aquafaba for binding and cashews for creaminess — will also allow you to replicate traditional dishes in a compassionate and health-conscious manner.

As you familiarize yourself with these recipes, consider the nutritional aspects of your meals. Balancing proteins, carbohydrates, and healthy fats is crucial in a vegan diet, so experimenting with legumes, whole grains, and nuts can lead to not only delicious but also nourishing dishes.

# What is the primary ingredient in traditional tofu production?

The primary ingredient in traditional tofu production is soybeans. You start by soaking the soybeans in water, then grinding them to create soy milk. After boiling the mixture, you add a coagulant, such as magnesium chloride or calcium sulfate, to help the soy milk curdle. Once the curds form, you press them into molds to create the final tofu block. This process not only relies on the quality of the soybeans but also on your technique to achieve the desired texture and flavor.

# A) Almonds

Almonds are a nutritious snack you can enjoy anytime. Packed with healthy fats, fiber, protein, and vitamins, they support heart health and weight management. You can eat them raw, roasted, or as almond butter. Incorporate them into your breakfast by adding them to oatmeal or smoothies, or use them in salads for extra crunch. Just a handful daily can boost your energy and keep you feeling full. Remember to choose unsalted varieties to maximize their health benefits. So, next time you’re looking for a quick snack, reach for some almonds!

# B) Soybeans

Soybeans are versatile legumes that you can incorporate into your diet in various forms, such as tofu, tempeh, and soy milk. They are rich in protein, fiber, and essential nutrients, making them a great choice for plant-based diets.

Additionally, soybeans contribute to sustainable agriculture, improving soil health and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By choosing soybeans, you’re not only nourishing yourself but also supporting environmentally friendly practices.

# C) Peas

Peas are a nutritious and versatile vegetable you can easily incorporate into your meals. They’re rich in vitamins A, C, and K, as well as protein and fiber, making them a great addition to a balanced diet. You can enjoy them fresh, frozen, or canned, adding them to salads, soups, or stir-fries. Their sweet flavor and vibrant color can enhance any dish. Plus, they’re quick to cook and pair well with various ingredients. Don’t forget to try different types, like snap peas or snow peas, for a delightful twist in your culinary creations!

# Which of the following is a popular plant-based alternative to dairy milk?

One popular plant-based alternative to dairy milk is almond milk. It’s made by blending almonds with water and straining the mixture, resulting in a creamy, nutty-flavored beverage. You might also consider options like soy milk, oat milk, or coconut milk, each offering unique flavors and nutritional benefits. These alternatives are often fortified with vitamins and minerals, making them a suitable choice for those seeking a dairy-free lifestyle. Enjoy experimenting with different types to find the one that best suits your taste!

# A) Coconut Milk

Coconut milk is a creamy liquid made from the grated meat of mature coconuts. When you use it in cooking, it adds a rich, tropical flavor to dishes like curries, soups, and desserts.

Whether you’re lactose intolerant or just enjoy its unique taste, coconut milk can be a delightful addition to your diet. Just remember to choose unsweetened varieties for a healthier option.

# B) Oat Milk

Oat milk is a creamy, dairy-free alternative made from oats and water. It’s naturally sweet, nutritious, and often fortified with vitamins and minerals. You can enjoy it in coffee, smoothies, or cereals, making it a versatile option for your diet. If you’re lactose intolerant or following a vegan lifestyle, oat milk is a great choice. Just remember to check for added sugars in store-bought versions. You can also make it at home easily by blending oats with water and straining the mixture. It’s a sustainable option, as oats require less water to grow than almonds or soy.

# C) Almond Milk

Almond milk is a popular dairy alternative made from ground almonds and water. As you consider switching to almond milk, you’ll find it low in calories and naturally lactose-free, making it a great option for those with lactose intolerance.

It suggests that each option contributes to the answer and is valid in its own right. When faced with this choice, reflect on the context and ensure that the other options indeed support this collective answer. If they do, selecting “D” could be your best bet. Always double-check to confirm that each statement aligns with your reasoning.

# What term is used to describe a diet that excludes all animal products, including meat, dairy, and eggs?

The term you’re looking for is “vegan diet.” This lifestyle choice excludes all animal products, meaning you won’t consume meat, dairy, eggs, or any other animal-derived ingredients. Embracing a vegan diet often reflects a commitment to health, environmental sustainability, or animal rights. If you decide to adopt this way of eating, you’ll find a wide variety of plant-based foods to explore, including fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds.

# A) Vegetarian

As a vegetarian, you embrace a lifestyle that excludes meat and often fish. You enjoy a diverse range of plant-based foods, including fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. This choice may stem from health concerns, ethical beliefs about animal welfare, or environmental considerations. You often explore creative cooking methods and recipes to ensure your meals are both delicious and nutritious. You might also connect with a community of like-minded individuals who share your passion for sustainable living and compassionate eating. Remember, being a vegetarian can be a fulfilling journey of discovery and flavors!

# B) Flexitarian

A flexitarian diet allows you to enjoy a primarily plant-based eating pattern while still incorporating meat and animal products occasionally. It encourages you to focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, making it both nutritious and flexible. You can experiment with various recipes, discovering new flavors while reducing your overall meat consumption. This approach supports environmental sustainability and can improve your health without the strict limitations of a full vegetarian or vegan diet. Embrace the flexibility, listen to your body, and make choices that feel right for you.

# C) Vegan

Choosing a vegan lifestyle means embracing a diet free of animal products, focusing instead on fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and seeds. You’ll explore diverse flavors and textures while prioritizing health and sustainability. Adopting veganism can boost your energy, improve digestion, and reduce your environmental footprint. It may also encourage you to get creative in the kitchen, experimenting with plant-based recipes. Remember to ensure you’re meeting your nutritional needs, particularly for protein, vitamins B12 and D, and omega-3 fatty acids. Enjoy the journey of discovering new foods and ethical living!

# D) Pescatarian

A pescatarian diet includes fish and seafood but excludes other meats. If you choose this lifestyle, you’ll enjoy a variety of flavors from oceanic sources while still incorporating fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes. This diet offers health benefits, such as omega-3 fatty acids, which can support heart health. You also have the flexibility to explore different cuisines that highlight fish and seafood. Remember to select sustainable sources to help maintain marine ecosystems. Embracing this diet allows you to enjoy the best of both worlds: the richness of seafood and the freshness of plant-based foods.

# Which of these companies is known for its plant-based meat alternatives?

You’re likely thinking of Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods. Both companies are renowned for their innovative plant-based meat alternatives, designed to mimic the taste and texture of traditional meat. Beyond Meat offers products like burgers and sausages, while Impossible Foods is famous for its Impossible Burger, which contains heme, giving it a meaty flavor. If you’re exploring plant-based options, these brands are at the forefront of the movement, making it easier for you to enjoy meat-like flavors without animal products.

# A) Beyond Meat

Beyond Meat offers plant-based alternatives to traditional meat products, catering to those seeking healthier or more sustainable options. By choosing their products, you can enjoy familiar tastes and textures while benefiting the environment and reducing animal cruelty. Whether you’re vegan, vegetarian, or simply curious about meat alternatives, Beyond Meat provides a versatile range of items, including burgers, sausages, and ground meat. Incorporating these into your meals can enhance your diet and align with a more eco-conscious lifestyle. Give them a try and discover how delicious plant-based eating can be!

# B) Kraft Heinz

Kraft Heinz is a major food and beverage company formed through the merger of Kraft Foods Group and H.J. Heinz Company in 2015. You’ll find a wide range of products under its umbrella, including sauces, snacks, and dairy items. With iconic brands like Heinz Ketchup and Kraft Mac & Cheese, it plays a significant role in your kitchen. The company focuses on innovation and sustainability, aiming to adapt to changing consumer preferences. If you’re looking for familiar flavors, Kraft Heinz is likely to have something that fits your needs.

# C) Nestlé

Nestlé is a global food and beverage leader, known for its wide range of products, from coffee and bottled water to pet food and baby formula. When you choose Nestlé, you engage with a brand that emphasizes quality, sustainability, and nutrition. They strive to create shared value for communities and the environment while innovating to meet consumer needs. By supporting Nestlé, you participate in their commitment to responsible sourcing and reducing environmental impact. Whether you enjoy their chocolate or coffee, you’re part of a larger effort to promote health and wellness worldwide.

# D) Tyson Foods

Tyson Foods is a major player in the global food industry, specializing in protein-based products like chicken, beef, and pork. You may recognize its brands, such as Tyson, Hillshire Farm, and Jimmy Dean. The company emphasizes sustainability and animal welfare, aiming to meet the growing demand for ethically sourced food. As a consumer, you might appreciate their efforts in innovation, health, and nutrition, which cater to various dietary preferences. Whether you’re cooking at home or dining out, Tyson Foods likely plays a role in providing convenient and accessible protein options for your meals.

# What is the main benefit often associated with adopting a vegan diet, according to various studies?

The main benefit often associated with adopting a vegan diet is improved health. Various studies suggest that a plant-based diet can lower the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. You’ll likely find that vegan diets are rich in nutrients, fiber, and antioxidants, which can enhance overall well-being. Additionally, you may experience better weight management and increased energy levels. By making this dietary choice, you not only support your health but also contribute positively to environmental sustainability and animal welfare.

# A) Increased cholesterol levels

If you have increased cholesterol levels, it’s important to evaluate your diet and lifestyle. Focus on incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains while reducing saturated fats and trans fats. Regular physical activity can also help lower your cholesterol. Consider speaking with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and potential medication if necessary. Monitor your cholesterol levels regularly to track your progress and make adjustments as needed. Remember, small changes can lead to significant improvements in your overall health. Prioritize your well-being and take proactive steps towards healthier cholesterol levels.

# B) Reduced risk of chronic diseases

By adopting a healthy lifestyle, you can significantly reduce your risk of chronic diseases. Regular exercise, balanced nutrition, and adequate sleep strengthen your immune system and improve heart health. You’ll lower your chances of developing conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and certain cancers. Staying active and making mindful food choices also help manage your weight and improve overall well-being. Prioritizing these habits not only enhances your quality of life but also promotes longevity. Each small change you make contributes to a healthier, disease-free future. Take control of your health today for a better tomorrow.

# C) Higher protein intake

Higher protein intake can benefit you in several ways. It supports muscle growth and repair, enhances satiety, and aids in weight management. By incorporating more protein into your diet, you may experience increased energy levels and improved metabolic rate. It also plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy skin, hair, and nails. Opt for lean sources like chicken, fish, legumes, and dairy to meet your protein needs. Remember to balance your intake with other macronutrients for optimal health. Always consult a healthcare professional before making significant dietary changes to ensure it aligns with your personal health goals.

# D) Greater reliance on processed foods

Greater reliance on processed foods can lead to various health issues, including obesity and nutritional deficiencies. When you frequently choose convenience over whole, fresh options, you may consume higher levels of sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium. These ingredients can affect your energy levels and overall well-being. To improve your health, consider incorporating more whole foods like fruits, vegetables, and grains into your diet. Cooking at home can also help you control what goes into your meals, leading to a more balanced and nutritious lifestyle. Prioritizing whole foods over processed options can significantly benefit your health.

1pcsunn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Tasty_Cupcake_6710/comments/1pcsunn/amtah/,AMTAH??,"so story time, I moved in with a friend let’s call her Alicia, everything was great after I escaped a horrible roommate called Sarah. back story Sarah had my fight or flight response responding horribly and the one time I confronted her she laughed in my face and said I was overreacting. fast forward to alicia. things were going great until she moved her “boyfriend” Alex out to California. I did a lot of cleaning and cooking. Alex worked at a company for about a month then twisted his ankle and quit his job under the guise of hating it. this man child wouldn’t wear deodorant and didn’t shower. one time after woking super late and I got home I noticed that the trash hadn’t been taken out and the kitchen and living room were a mess. I let it go and continued to clean because I was living here super discounted. about a month goes by and I get sick of it. I bring it up to my roommate “hey since Alex is here everyday and all he does is game and eat. can he at least take out the trash?” then all hell breaks loose. she gets mad and storms out. comes back and writes on the fridge expo board “it’s not that hard to take out the trash, love, the household maid.“ feeling bad since I wasn’t contributing much I start to get home from work and clean like my life depends on it. I clean everyday for 3 months. she’s still mad. I try to cook onions and peppers in a pan and Alex gets within 10 feet of it and almost throws up. I deal with this shit for 4 months. then they move another girl into the apartment. we’re gonna call her Amy. well amy moves in but actually tries to find a job but can’t get one due to lack of experience and being an out of stater. but me and her kick it off immediately which pisses off alicia since they’re best friends. fast forward a few months. I can’t cook in the kitchen anymore because cooking means I need to clean for 2 hours, remove 8 plus bags of trash, then cook then clean again because it’s my mess. then after the “can your boyfriend take out the trash?” question appeared everything was my fault. my problem. about two weeks later im doing some intimate things in my room and Alex just barges in and I barley cover myself. She’s immediately pissed and makes a snarky post on Facebook about me. Well anyway she gets in trouble and doesn’t listen to me about rent and payments. I have two freeloaders on my hands and I’m handling half of expenses. I cant afford all of them, and it may be dickheadish of me but I didn’t pay all of a month of rent because I straight up couldn’t afford it. Let alone the electric bill because they had 27 snakes. Yes you heard that right. 27 fucking snakes. I thought that 3 was a lot. And I was wrong. one night I bought groceries, specifically milk, cream cheese, and tater tots. I don’t remember what I was gonna make but less than 8 hours later it was all gone. I made a note on the expo board about how things aren’t cheap and I had a plan and to please replace it when you could. This of course didn’t go well with alex who had no money. He started to be extra petty, barged into my room, stole the living room remote leaving Amy unable to enjoy the tv, and lies about it. Me being me I buy a new tv because she doesn’t deserve that shit and Amy meets me out in the parking lot and told me. “Alex says if you bring a tv home you can’t use the entertainment stand” in response I used the coffee table that I helped pay for. And I put a child lock pin on the tv so he couldn’t get into it Because fuck this guy. Eventually he told me that he was packing up the kitchen and told me to grab anything I paid for. so, in return I grabbed all the spices, sponges, soap, cleaning products and gear, silverware, plates, bowls, cups, the fucking cookie jar, and small appliances. after my roomate got out of trouble she texted me pissed that I did all of that. But she spent almost a year defending this dude. So tell me. AITAH for taking back what I bought? ",1,1764730809.0,u_Tasty_Cupcake_6710,0,1.0,False

 [15h](https://substack.com/@jwoginrich/note/c-183320290?)

In a few hours a snowstorm will hit this farm. This means one of my favorite mornings of the year is about to happen!

After sunrise I’ll head out and blanket the mare and fill her pole barn with a whole bale. I’ll carry more hay up to the sheep shed, too. The pigs will get a whole nest of hay and breakfast, and the chickens will get their feeders topped off.

Once everyone is sated, I will return to the farmhouse and gear up my hawk and head out into the first flurries of the day to take her hunting. Working up a sweat running through the woods with her. Feeling cold air fill my lungs and my legs still able to carry me across the landscape.

Once she’s done and fed, we will both go back inside. I’ll set her on her perch, and take off my sweater to dry. I’ll get coffee, an epsom salt herbal foot soak, and find a cat for my lap. I will read a whole chapter. I will stretch in a way I was told was “too much”. I take up all the space I want now.

Then I’m making buttermilk pancakes, eating as much as I want, and then retiring to the fireside to read while the world blows wild outside my window.

Taking the day off to rest. Taking the day off to heal. Taking the day off to be grateful I made it through November and managed the mortgage on time, that’s three months I haven’t fallen behind. Incredible. You have no idea how long I have been working towards this. Well, some of you do. Some of you have been reading my story for 2 decades now.

…And tomorrow I will shovel and rake roofs and promote pet portraits and pork, and tomorrow I will figure out how to earn some money and believe a better future for myself is possible.

But today: Snow, books, and warmth.

This was the life I always wanted. Not money. Not a fancy car. Not travel, or kids, or expensive clothes. I wanted a Tuesday morning of wild adventure to be my norm, a life with animals and trees. I want to be cold and tired and covered in hay and sweat and lanolin, just to better enjoy the soft return to stillness and warmth in the home I built for myself, by myself, however humble.

It’s been the work of my life to get to this uneventful weekday morning. And I never, ever, will take it for granted.",3,1764730807.0,coldantlercritics,0,1.0,False

1pcssf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/1pcssf0/cant_figure_out_my_type/,Cant figure out my type.,"Im not going to be mentioning the types im confused about and types I suspect myself to be because I want to avoid biases of any kind. I find it difficult to adhere to stereotypes of nearly any type , really and if I look inwards on the functions , some do seem prominent but sometimes theyre contrasting functions so I figured I need a second opinion. Also if it counts for anything , i am 18F. Here are some facts about me : 

1. I enjoy researching on topics especially in biology and psychology. My latest hyperfixation is genetics and usually a hyperfixation doesnt go away for me until I have created some obscure theories about it that I dont think anyone else has come up with , all backed by information. I also enjoy writing , chess , gaming,  self-improvement (most times) , shopping (not excessively) and learning new languages. 

2. I wouldnt say I am awkward in social situations. I just dont have a lot to say , even to close ones. I have been told I am quiet but I personally dont agree.  With unknown people who's frequency I dont match , i just stay quiet and have been told i have a RBF. With unknown people who's frequency i match , i am polite , humorous and sarcastic. With close ones , I am childish and goofy mainly to cover up the fact I am an NPC otherwise. I am usually straightforward and blunt and I speak my mind.

3. I enjoy trying new things and finding the best option out of a range of similar things to make it the permanent option. This could be drinks , study methods , anything. I like trying everything and finding out what works best for me so i can always use it. I hardly ever switch after that. I enjoy finding meaning and intention in everything. 

4. I imagine my future and past in the form of pictures. I would envision my future , complete with a blurry picture of my surroundings , what ill be doing , wearing , etc. and then I would ask myself if this is the future i want. I would tweak whatever didnt fit with my compass . This is usually how i make decisions too. I also recall the past in the form of pictures - i sometimes remember the exact shirt i was wearing , the colour of the sky , etc. in vivid detail. 

5. I am very clumsy in real life. I constantly knock over things while walking , have problems crossing busy roads , forget where I kept things constantly , etc. 

6. When stressed, I really retreat into my head. Everything seems very pointless and i start wondering about the concept of the things around me in a negative way - money,  road signs , the cup of coffee I am drinking from. I ignore daily routines , obsessively plan to get back on track but quickly abandon the plans because it feels ""fake and purposeless"". I find it hard to care about anything or anyone else and become excessively rude , self-centered and self-critical. 

7. I am usually a very optimistic person because I have a talent of finding a way out of most challenging situations. I am someone who appreciates myself and those close to me. I care about the emotions of people close to me quite a lot , but I usually find it hard to express that care. 

8. Im extremely perfectionistic , have to organize everything an exact way and im paranoid about very specific things (for example :  pen caps being open). This has sometimes held me back from finishing my work before deadlines since they wouldnt be perfect enough. 

9. I have one close friend and I have made up a reason to dislike everyone else. I have found this weird about myself - focusing on flaws in people or systems instead of what it has to offer but oftentimes this helps me get the whole gist of anyone or anything from the first impression. I am impatient when it comes to people but very patient with my goals. 

10. I need to research and plan EVERYTHING. If i dont , it makes me worry about every little thing. This is also why i enjoy comminucating with other people with curious , complex minds and the weirder they are , the better. I am a very ambitious person and I hate people who complain without taking active steps to make the situation better. I appreciate other ambitious people who focus on solutions. 

11. I romanticize my future and have a firm belief everything will work out for me , despite things not being the best in the moment. I have long lists , plans and systems that I am dying to try out when I get the freedom and environment to. I have a habit of putting these goals before others , even close ones. I am aware of that , and I am working on it. 

12. I have also noticed that sensors call me dumb but intuitives think im very smart. I am not hating or demeaning any mbti and I am simply stating observations and facts. Im not sure what this could mean (actually I do have an idea) , but if that could account for anything , you should use the information for guessing my mbti. 

13. I like finding my own explanations for everything . Its a habit I have and I have come to love. Something without an explanation is stupid , pointless and useless. 

You may be guessing a particular mbti but here are some things that are unlike that MBTI that I possess : 

I laugh a lot. Like a lot. I try to make jokes and i fail badly. I cry to sad songs and sad movies privately. I am not a cold-hearted robot (i think , although people like to call me one) and I freely say things like ""i love you"" to close ones. I sometimes spend whole days gaming and being totally unproductive. I can be really really loud sometimes when I am alone , which i call being impulsive. I like doing slightly unconventional things to prove I am alive just to be disgusted by that later. I do not get everything right the first try , actually most people are better than me in their first tries. I am a slow learner but once I do learn something , it sticks forever. I sometimes break rules that seem totally pointless to me but I think I do it in a very planned , secret manner. I sometimes focus on other stupid things instead of just doing my work. 

Thats all I have to say. If you have something else to ask , you can ask in the comments. I would appreciate if you have a guess , I am really confused about my mbti. Thanks for taking the time to read. ",1,1764730635.0,MbtiTypeMe,3,1.0,False

1pcsqnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pcsqnw/confusing_body_language_from_married_but/,Confusing Body Language From Married (But ‘Separated’) Gym Friend Need Help Reading This?,"
I’ve been talking to a woman at my gym since August. She’s normally quiet, reserved, not flirty, not the type to hug random guys or make strong eye contact with strangers. But with me she opened up really fast. Within a few interactions she was already telling me about her marriage problems.

That threw me off because I’ve known married people for years who never tell me anything personal. She unloaded everything early on.

What she usually tells me:

* She and her husband don’t talk at home
* They sleep in separate rooms
* They’re basically roommates for their child
* She says she’s moving out soon but the date changes every month
* She says he begs her every day to work things out
* She says she tells him no
* She claims she’s been looking into separation or divorce but hasn’t talked to a lawyer

But even with all that going on, they still go out together. Concerts, bars, mall trips, hookah lounges. When I ask how that works she just laughs and says it’s awkward.

It’s hard for me to tell if she’s trying to come across as single and available or if her home life is really that messy and inconsistent.

She slips sometimes. She told me they don’t talk at all but then started telling me about his car accident. When I asked more questions she stopped and said she forgot she told me they don’t talk, then brushed it off.

That’s why I’m trying to understand the body language side of this. Is she hiding things or trying to look more single around me?

Her behavior toward me makes things even more confusing:

* She hugs me a lot even though she isn’t a hugger with most people
* She asks about my type
* She asked if I hooked up with anyone while traveling
* She seemed a little jealous
* She shows me random women on Instagram and asks if she should follow them back
* She often asks to work out together
* Sometimes she makes plans first
* She’s agreed to coffee or lunch with me multiple times
* After one hangout she posted “Made my day” on Instagram Notes
* Today she told me her husband found my Instagram
* She vents to me about their daily arguments
* She seems comfortable opening up only to me

But today everything felt different. No hug when she arrived and no hug when she left. She just shook my hand. She was venting a lot about her husband and seemed stressed and emotionally drained. It didn’t feel like she was excited to see me. This is the first time her energy has been flat.

My question for people who read body language well:

Is her behavior toward me showing she wants me to escalate physically
or
is she just trying to keep an emotional connection and use me as comfort

I’m not trying to start anything with her. I’m not trying to break up a marriage. I just like the attention and the gym vibe. But the inconsistencies in her home life story combined with her reserved personality and how open she is with me make it hard to read her intentions.

The extra confusion today is that she mentioned her husband found my Instagram he keeps begging her to fix things she says she’s moving out soon and she didn’t hug me at all.

Is she pulling back because she’s scared
Is she overwhelmed
Was she never actually attracted to me in the first place

I’m really just trying to understand the body language not judge her marriage.

What does this kind of behavior usually mean
Have you seen this pattern before

Today I had my morning coffee but again made another stupid decision and had an afternoon coffee. All evening I’ve been feeling super anxious. I have this ball of anxiety in my stomach. I keep feeling like I’m having chest pains. I keep taking deep breaths to make sure I’m….breathing okay? I’m super hyper-fixated on my heart checking for heart flutters. My journey started with a caffeine/zyn induced panic attack which made me want to quit. Does it get better?? I already went to the ER twice in the last few months. Saw my doctor multiple times. EKG’s. Chest X-Ray. Troponin and other blood work. Blood pressure. Everything was normal. I’m really considering if I should reach out to my doctor again or if maybe I really do need to cut down on caffeine. Ugh. Gonna lay in bed and watch a movie lol to ease my mind.

We introduced ourselves at the start (I’ll call her S). Throughout the workout we talked briefly about dumbbells, the exercises, normal stuff. Before the last set, I asked how the workout was going and she told me which exercise she didn’t like. Just small, normal talk.

At the end of class I re-introduced myself, she told me she’s been coming since September, she lives nearby, and she likes that the gym uses weights instead of being all cardio. She also actually encouraged me to continue talking when I accidentally cut myself off because I got self-conscious (“No no, tell me… please go on”). That felt like a positive sign.

After class, she was standing near the exit waiting for space because people store their stuff there. I said “Have a nice evening,” held the door, and walked out. She followed shortly after. Nothing unusual.

Here’s where I might be overthinking:  
When near the exit, I can’t tell if she was just tired and neutral after the workout (totally normal), or if she was actually open to talking more and I missed the moment. I didn’t want to come across as a creep or someone hitting on women at the gym, so I kept it very normal.

The truth is, she seemed polite, comfortable, and even encouraging during the workout. But after class she had a neutral expression, so I couldn’t read if she was interested in more conversation or just zoning out like anyone would after an intense workout.

**My questions:**

1. Am I reading too much into a completely normal interaction?
2. Next time I see her, would it be weird to say something simple like “Hey S, good to see you again,” chat for a minute, and then ask if she’d want to grab a quick coffee after class sometime?
3. For women who do group fitness classes — would that feel creepy or unwelcome if done respectfully?

I was far from the only person to be virtually introduced to the genre of reggae by the album, which featured his classics “Many Rivers to Cross,” “You Can Get It If You Really Want,” and “I Can See Clearly Now.” He passed away at 81 due to a seizure and subsequent pneumonia.

**Dick Cheney**, George W. Bush’s running mate and one of the most influential vice presidents in U.S. history, passed away at 84 from complications due to pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease. Despite all the flowing and glowing tributes, let’s not forget he was the war hawk who falsely accused Saddam Hussein of having weapons of mass destruction in order to start an unnecessary war that was devasting to American soldiers and everyone else involved. Cheney took the U.S. to new lows in systematizing torture and ranted about the unlimited power of the presidency, which we are now paying dearly for in the form of our current leader.

**Paul Tagliabue** was one of only three NFL commissioners during my lifetime. For 17 years, from 1989 to 2006, he focused on making it the most popular sport in the U.S. and wildly succeeded. Tagliabue had been a basketball player at my alma mater Georgetown before successes like upping the amount of NFL teams to 32, overseeing the construction of 20 stadiums, orchestrating labor peace, and modernizing the NFL business enterprise. He passed away at 84 from heart failure complicated by Parkinson’s.

**Tom Stoppard** co-wrote the screenplay for the 1998 film classic *Shakespeare in Love*, but more importantly left a legendary mark on the theater world, winning five Emmys starting with 1968’s take on *Hamlet* called *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead*. I was lucky enough to see *Arcadia* at The Haymarket Theater in London in March 1995, and when I was a kid in 1980, [my dad directed](https://www.siue.edu/artsandsciences/theater/current-season/past-seasons/season1980.shtml) *Travesties* at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville. Stoppard passed away at age 88.

**Burt Meyers** invented many classic, post-war boom plastic toys of the 1960s, including Rock ’Em Sock ’Em Robots, Lite-Brite, and MouseTrap. He was 99.

**Donna Jean Godchaux-MacKay** was a singer with The Grateful Dead in the 1970s, joining the band with her keyboard-playing husband Keith Godchaux. She was 78 and had a long cancer battle, but her voice lives on in countless live recordings and on albums including *Europe ’72*, *Wake of the Flood*, and *Terrapin Station*.

**June Lockhart** was known for her TV star turns in *Lassie* and *Lost in Space*, but what I’ll always remember her for was her role as Tori Spelling’s grandmother in *Beverly Hills, 90210*. As Celia Martin, she died in a hospital in season 8 of my favorite teen soap show. In real life, she passed away at age 100.

**Rodney Rogers** was an absolute beast from 1990 to 1993 and almost single-handedly made the Wake Forest Demon Deacons a threat to other great ACC teams of the era like North Carolina and Duke. Tim Duncan would go to the school right after Rogers left for a successful NBA career and kept Wake Forest among the best in the conference. Rogers passed away at 55 due to complications from being paralyzed from the shoulders down back in 2008 in an ATV crash.

**Michael Ray Richardson** was a star guard with the New York Knicks who had almost as much of a prestigious resume in the category of cocaine abuse. He was given a lifetime ban from the NBA and has passed away at 70 from prostate cancer.

**Lenny Wilkens** was named the coach of the Seattle SuperSonics in 1969, becoming only the second Black coach in NBA history. He would go on to retire with—at the time—the most wins of any coach in the league’s history. He was one of a select few who made the Hall of Fame as both a coach and a player, and passed away at age 88.

**Bob Trumpy** was a former Cincinnati Bengals tight end who has passed away at the age of 80. While he made two Pro Bowls as a player, what I truly remember him for is his broadcast work calling NFL games at NBC alongside Dick Enberg, Bob Costas, and Don Criqui.

**Kenny Easley** was one of the greatest defensive backs in football in the 1980s. He is a Hall of Famer who starred for the Seattle Seahawks but had his career cut short by a serious kidney condition. He passed away at age 66.

**Gilson Lavis** was no Difford or Tilbrook, but he was still the drummer of the excellent ‘80s wave band [Squeeze](https://popculturelunchbox.substack.com/p/great-magazine-reads-squeeze-arent). He played on all their biggest hits, including “Tempted” and “Black Coffee in Bed.” My personal faves are “Up the Junction” and “Pulling Mussels (From the Shell).” I finally got to see Squeeze for the first time when they opened for Hall and Oates, although Lavis had long ago, in 1991, stopped being a band member. He passed away at 74.

1pcseoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1pcseoq/which_under_desk_elliptical_fits_in_small/,Which under desk elliptical fits in small apartments?,"Looking for an under desk elliptical that won't take over your tiny apartment? You're not alone. A lot of people want to stay active while working from home, but space is always the big problem.

The good news is that compact models exist specifically for small living spaces. The trick is knowing what to look for before buying one.

## What Makes an Under Desk Elliptical Apartment-Friendly?

Size matters when you're dealing with limited square footage. The best options measure around 20-25 inches in length and 17-20 inches in width. Anything bigger might not fit comfortably under your desk or in your closet when you're done using it.

Weight is another factor. Lighter models (around 20-30 pounds) are easier to move around and tuck away. You don't want something so heavy that it becomes permanent furniture in your already cramped space.

## Key Features to Consider

**Low Profile Design** - Look for machines that sit low to the ground. Your knees shouldn't bump into your desk while pedaling. Models under 10 inches in height usually work well with standard desks.

**Quiet Operation** - Thin walls mean noisy equipment isn't ideal. Magnetic resistance systems run quieter than mechanical ones, which matters when you have neighbors close by.

**Portability** - Built-in handles or lightweight frames make storage simple. You want something you can grab and move without throwing out your back.

## The Compact Solution

Mini elliptical machines designed for desk use typically fit the bill perfectly. They give you a solid workout without requiring a dedicated exercise room. You can pedal while answering emails, watching TV, or reading.

The space-saving design means you can slide it under your couch, bed, or in a closet when guests come over. No one needs to know your living room doubles as a gym.

If you want to see some top-rated options that actually fit in small spaces, [check out these compact models](https://athomewave.com/under-desk-elliptical) that people are using in apartments right now.

## Storage Tips

Even the smallest under desk elliptical needs a home. Keep it under your coffee table or next to your couch so it's always within reach. When you can see it, you're more likely to use it.

Some people keep theirs permanently under their desk if they work from home full-time. Others prefer to bring it out only during work hours and store it afterward.

## Worth the Investment?

For apartment dwellers, a compact pedal exerciser beats a bulky treadmill or exercise bike any day. You get similar benefits without sacrificing half your living room.

The average person burns 150-200 calories per hour using one of these machines at a moderate pace. That adds up when you're sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day anyway.

Your small apartment doesn't have to limit your fitness goals. With the right equipment, you can stay active without tripping over exercise gear every time you walk to the kitchen.",1,1764729576.0,productplace,0,1.0,False
1pcsecp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pcsecp/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_she_was_trauma/,AITA for telling my girlfriend she was “trauma dumping” after I hit my emotional limit?,"I (29M) have been with my girlfriend (27F) for a little over three years. We don’t live together. Our relationship is genuinely great most of the time, like 95% of the time I love being with her and we’re solid.

The other 5% is when she falls into depressive spirals. During those times she gets extremely pessimistic, shuts down any advice (even when she asks for it), and falls into worst-case-scenario thinking. She also refuses therapy. I’ve brought it up gently, explained that some of our friends have benefited from it, and tried to show her it’s not about “something being wrong with her,” but she is completely closed off to the idea.

Most of her stress right now comes from her job. She originally didn’t like it because she wasn’t doing enough work, but once she did get work she realized she just genuinely dislikes the job entirely. So lately our usual lunchtime calls (we talk because I WFH and she eats in her car) have turned into her venting about how miserable she is, how she wants to quit, how she wants to leave mid-day, etc. Sometimes she “jokes” about walking out and never returning, but the jokes have become so frequent they don’t feel like jokes anymore.

I try my best to listen because I care about her, but it’s been emotionally draining.

Recently, I referred her for a job at my company. She actually got a recruiter phone screening. Instead of being excited, she immediately spiraled into:
	•	it’s just a courtesy call
	•	she’ll never get an opportunity like this
	•	she’d be stupid for trying
	•	it will make her more anxious
	•	she should cancel the whole thing

I tried to help her see it might not be worst-case. But she kept shutting every positive or neutral possibility down.

This is a pattern. Sometimes she goes into “what’s the point of trying” spirals about her whole life: she says she’s already “so far behind,” that her degree is useless because she’s not using it, and she compares herself to everyone in her friend group. I always tell her degrees don’t define your job path and everyone moves at their own pace, but I never feel like I can convince her of anything once she’s in that headspace.

Anyway, during this phone screening meltdown, I finally hit my emotional limit. After she repeated several times that she wanted to cancel it, I said, “If you want to cancel it then just cancel it.” And then, out of frustration, I added that I felt overwhelmed because it felt like she was trauma-dumping on me.

She immediately said, “I’m sorry that I’m depressed,” and hung up.

I knew instantly I used the wrong word. I texted her a half hour later apologizing, saying “trauma dumping” wasn’t fair, but that I did genuinely hit my limit with how heavy everything felt that day. I also told her I want to support her, but I can’t be the only person she leans on emotionally, especially since she refuses therapy and doesn’t open up to anyone else. It gets overwhelming and I don’t always know how to help. I try and understand that she isn’t always looking for help and is sometimes just looking for someone to listen, but I think I just hit my limit and it frustrates me a little when she vents so often, but doesn’t seem capable of making a change. I truly think this stems from her depression.

Since then, she’s barely responded. She texted me last night when I tried calling that she wasn’t in the mood to talk that night, and she ignored all my texts the next day. Now it’s been about a day and a half with no communication, and I don’t know what to do.

I care about her more than anything, but I feel like I’m drowning emotionally when I’m her only outlet for her depression, anxiety, job misery, and self-comparisons especially when she rejects any other form of support.



TL;DR:
My girlfriend frequently unloads her anxieties, pessimism, and self-doubt onto me; things like believing she’s “too stupid” for opportunities, assuming interviews are courtesy calls, spiraling about being behind in life, comparing herself to friends, and saying there’s no point in trying. I care about her a lot, but it’s become emotionally draining because I never know how to help and it’s starting to affect me. She refuses therapy because she doesn’t want to be told “something is wrong,” and I feel stuck between wanting to support her and needing healthier emotional boundaries.

Note:
I used ChatGPT to help me organize and clearly word my thoughts for this post.



Edit 1 (Her response):
She said she feels like when she’s going through something hard, I shut her down before she can fully express herself — whether by cutting her off mid-sentence, trying to fix things she doesn’t want fixed, or telling her I can’t take more. She said it feels premature, disrespectful, and like I’m not putting myself in her shoes. From her perspective, if I had a bad day and opened up, I wouldn’t want her to tell me it was “too much” or to go talk to someone else.

She also said that when I called it “trauma dumping,” it really hurt because she hasn’t been “just complaining.” She’s been feeling extremely depressed, stuck, and completely dissociated — barely able to get out of bed, exhausted, relying on multiple coffees just to function, and constantly angry at herself during the workday. She said she opened up because she needed support from the person she trusts most, and hearing me shut it down made her feel even more trapped and alone.

She added that she doesn’t have many friends to talk to — really just one — so when I suggest talking to other people, it feels like I’m highlighting something painful she already knows. She said it makes her feel like she can’t rely on me emotionally, and that she now feels like she has to walk on eggshells with me, which scares her. She said she needs to know whether I’m actually able to be the kind of partner she can rely on during serious times.",6,1764729550.0,AITAH,17,1.0,False

My Simple 8-Step Guide,"Since March, I've managed to drop 40 lbs , and I'm only about 11 lbs away from my goal weight. After reading everyone else's experiences and figuring out what works for my body, here are the key takeaways:

The 8 Commandments of My Cut

1. Mindful Macros (The Food) Every meal is built around the same formula: Quality Carbs + Lean Protein + High-Fiber Veggies + Healthy Fats. I follow the 80% full rule and cook everything myself using low-oil and low-sodium methods.

2. Just Say No to Snacking This was a huge one. Zero tolerance for snacks between meals. Period.

3. Extend Your Overnight Fast I try to have my dinner around 5 or 6 PM. Giving yourself a longer overnight fast means your body runs out of immediate fuel and starts tapping into fat reserves sooner.

4. Hydrate Like Crazy I make sure to crush at least 2 liters of water daily. It turbocharges your metabolism. Just slow down on the water intake later in the evening to avoid bloat/waking up.

5. Ditch the Liquid Sugar Seriously, cut out the sodas, fruit juices, and especially the sugary boba/milk teas. They are loaded with empty calories. Unsweetened soy milk and plain dairy milk are great protein substitutes.

6. Move Your Body Exercise will make the numbers drop faster, but if you absolutely hate structured workouts, just walking is enough to burn calories and make a difference. Consistency is key.

7. Become Best Friends with Black Coffee Black coffee is an incredible dieting hack. It helps speed up your metabolism and aids in fat burning. If you're serious about the cut, this is a must-have.

8. Get Your Head Straight You need grit and patience for this journey. Don't weigh yourself every single day—daily fluctuations are totally normal. A solid, positive mindset is half the battle. Stay consistent, and the results will follow!

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

Full transparency - I’m pretty new to this. I’ve got the LLC set up, website in progress, and I’m finishing up a tech sales certification, but I’m basically figuring this out as I go.
I’m not looking for someone to hold my hand through everything, but I’d really value connecting with someone who’s been through this before. Someone who can point out the stuff I’m not thinking about, help me avoid rookie mistakes, and give me honest feedback when I’m off track.
Specifically, I could use guidance on:
	•	Building credibility when you’re just starting out
	•	Actually finding and closing those first few clients
	•	Setting up systems that work instead of just staying busy
	•	Knowing what to focus on vs what to ignore early on
I’m willing to put in the work and figure things out, but having someone who’s already made these mistakes would be huge. If you’ve built a recruiting business (or any service business really) and would be open to grabbing coffee or jumping on a call sometime, I’d appreciate it.

Hi, I'm a 41F who has been dealing with vulvodynia issues for 13 years. Many doctors later and I finally figured out it relates to vulvodynia and most likely a hypertonic pelvic floor. My symptoms: burning (especially during flares), rawness, sensitivity to underwear, can't wear tampons, exams are painful, pain after sex, and the constant feeling of needing to pee (feeling in my urethra, not bladder). I do have constipation issues at times and external hemroids (don't really notice them), & diastasis recti. (The hemroids and diastasis recti was after having babies, everything else was before).

All uti, sti's,yeast, & cystpscopies have come back negative. Pap smears have been normal.

I've tried many things over the years and ice packs have been a life saver. Peri bottle to rinse, blotting with bamboo tp, started bioidentical topical estrogen 6 months ago, topical bioidentical progesterone 12 days of cycle, vitamin D3&K2, vitamin B12, fishoil, calcium citrate, magnesium, fiber, and a probiotic. I also started PT, a pelvic wand, and using a tens unit on my tibial nerve.

Reduced sugar a lot!, I drink one cup organic decaf coffee a day and sometimes no coffee, trying low oxalate diet. I don't drink alcohol or smoke. 

I'll be seeing Dr. Jill Krapf with the CVVD in FL at the end of March.

I used to be on a birth control pill years ago. I have since been blessed with 4 beautiful children. Symptoms started before babies and stayed the same through out. 

The frequent urination feeling is especially awful,  but so is the terrible burning flares although the PT stretches seem to be promising in reducing that. Could be the diet change too.

Anyway, can anyone relate? Thanks in advance! ",1,1764729359.0,PelvicFloor,0,1.0,False

For some backstory, me and my grandpa used to be very close when i was young. I’m 20(M) now and he died about a week or two after my 14th birthday. I attended his funeral with a kidney infection and even with a lot of unbearable pain i respected him a lot and stood the whole time the funeral was happening and after.
He was my best friend, biggest support, and only one who listened to me when i had a concern. When i had nightmares as a kid and would wake up in the middle of the night he’d cuddle me up on the couch to watch some WW2 movies and id fall asleep immediately out of boredom. When i experienced my first anxiety/panic attack at a young age before school he took me outside to play a guessing game and then gave me a ride on his bike to school. Long story short, we were close, and he was a wonderful person

He died of lung cancer in his 70s, i remember i didn’t visit much because i wasn’t able to handle the possibility of what ill see, I was a very cowardly kid, and the one time i did visit, i placed my arm on the bed and it accidentally landed on his leg, which was about as thin as my forearm, and i weigh 60kg, so you can imagine. He ignored it and continued asking me about school with his precious smile, and i ran to the bathroom and broke

That was the last time i saw him, the day after he was sent back to the village with grandma (he used to live in our house until i was 12) and died a few weeks after

Last night, I had a dream where im entering a bakery in my town and ordered a lemonade, and when i looked back to the seat i usually take, he was sitting there looking at me and smiling at me. As if he was waiting for me.I was excited to see him and sat down and we started talking. 

He asked me how is my brother, and i told him great, lives alone with his cat and is happy, apart from our dad giving us trouble, we were fine.

He then asked how was mom, his daughter. And i said good, and that her boyfriend is also a much better person than dad ever was, he chuckled at that and said that he was never fond of the man my dad grew into, and that he was much better when he was a teen, but that money got the best of him

He then asked me about college, I told him im prepping up for the entrance exam but I have been working full time at a very nice job for a year now. His smile got even bigger when i said that for some reason. I made a joke how i sometimes smoke the cigarettes he used to, even tho a brand is replaced by something else now (we as a family still keep his last pack) and that they’re super strong, but i can cope through it. He then asked me if i drink the same beer as him which i replied with a fast “absolutely not” because i dont like beer that much, and he laughed so hard

We then finished our drinks and left the bakery to walk outside, we saw an off-brand garfield restaurant and i commented how my friend would love to see this and took a picture, so he asked me about my friends 

I told him i have the best friends i could ask for, and that i really wish he could meet them one day
I was not fully aware of his passing at this moment of the dream

That then reminded me of my boyfriend, so i talked about him too, how he’s everything i could ever ask for, and that he’s very entertaining and interesting, smart and hilarious. and most importantly understanding. He then looked at me with a smile and said that he wishes to grab coffee with him, and that he seems wonderful

We continued walking and i checked my phone, I noticed that it was around the time i should be going for work so he walked me to my bus stop and as i was about to enter, the realization hit me, this is a dream, hes dead. i just said “i really miss you” and he looked at me for a few seconds before the bus door closed and said “i love you” and at the moment it felt like he was letting me go, even tho i should be one letting him go. 

At the doors closing i woke up, and was just in shock for the whole morning 


I dont know what this dream means, i dont know how it even happened, i just got my sick leave yesterday because of a small injury, this was so random, and it got me into a spiral all day

1pcs787,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1pcs787/i_explored_an_abandoned_hotel/,I Explored an Abandoned Hotel,"Before the horrors that took place at that hotel, my friends and I had been urban explorers. We had visited several abandoned malls, factories, and entire abandoned neighborhoods. We didn’t do it for money or for valuables that were left behind; we simply enjoyed seeing these structures that seemed to be completely abandoned at a moment's notice. Factories that still had machinery that hadn’t been moved since closing, malls with long abandoned stores with objects that had been left to gather dust. 



My two other friends were actually a couple, and I was their eternal third wheel, but we all had fun together. Merrisa and Justin had been together since pretty much kindergarten, and when I had met them in middle school, they both quickly took a liking to me, and we were soon inseparable from each other. It was in our junior year of high school when we started urban exploring at Justin’s behest. Our first building had been an abandoned house in the neighborhood. We climbed in through a broken window and entered the house, and I soon saw the appeal of it. 



It was a moment frozen in time. The family that had been evicted had been crackheads, and no one had wanted to buy the house, so it had sat for years. So many things had been left behind, and I was amazed by how surreal it felt. Merrisa wasn’t as excited at first, but soon she too fell under the spell. While the two lovebirds explored the upstairs, I stayed downstairs, walking over to the dresser, opening it, and I was amazed to find a photo of the family, in happier times, it seemed. I picked it up and stared at it, before looking around at the state of the house. Their whole life was preserved in this small snapshot. 



We didn’t take anything from the house, but from there, our new hobby was born. Every weekend, we would venture out and search for abandoned houses or properties to explore. We made sure that they were truly abandoned, and never once did we try to break into a property that someone clearly owned. We never made an entrance unless there was already one for us, be it a broken window, an open door, or no door at all. And we always made sure never to take anything, but we did document what we saw. 



We never uploaded any of the footage we used, it was purely for us. We acted stupidly, we told stupid inside jokes that only we knew about. And the most important thing for us, we had so much fun. Even into college, when we were unable to hang out as much, we still made sure to at least once a month, venture out to explore an abandoned property. I wish things could’ve stayed that way, but life had other intentions for the three of us. 



My grandparents were falling ill, and my parents had decided to move across several states to be closer to them, for emergencies, and if the day finally came that we would be needed to plan their funerals. With that, I would be moving away from my two best friends and continuing my studies at a different college. I was devastated, and hoped that there could be some way to stay close to Justin and Merrisa. But without my parents’ financial support, there was simply no way for me to afford an apartment and be a full-time student. Upon telling the couple, they were just as devastated, and the three of us began to think up elaborate ways for me to stay close to them, but they all came to nothing. So it was that two weeks before I was set to move away into some unknown future without them, that Justin texted in the group chat. 



He had found the perfect location for us to do one final exploration together. He kept it a secret from me, and Merrisa was only vaguely aware of where we were going. I was blown away that they were willing to skip that day of school, the two of them had perfect attendance records, just to do one last exploration with me. The plan was quickly drawn up, and the night before they arrived to pick me up, I began to pack my bag. I was bringing the essentials: a portable charger, a flashlight with plenty of backup batteries, a flare in case of emergencies, walkie-talkies, several granola bars, a first aid kit, and plenty of water. Justin always made fun of me for over-preparing, but I’ve always lived by the motto, better to have and not need than to not have and need. 



The morning of our last exploration, I woke up at the crack of dawn and exited out into the crisp morning air. There was a layer of fog just above the grass, and dew stuck to the blades of grass just outside my house. I exhaled gently and watched as my breath turned into steam. It wasn’t shockingly cold, since it was only mid-November, but it was chilly enough in the mornings to get a bit of steam to come out of my mouth. I took in the few minutes of pure silence that surrounded my neighborhood this early in the morning, until I heard a car pulling up to my driveway. 



Justin drove an old, beat-up Pontiac Grand Am, which we all affectionately called, the piece of shit. I was honestly surprised that it had lasted him this long, considering that he had started driving it the moment he got his driver’s permit. The old rust bucket came to a stop, and the doors immediately swung open. Quickly, Justin and Merrisa exited the car and ran over to me, giving me a tight hug and nearly tackling me to the floor with their combined weight. 



Justin was around my height, though he swore that he was taller than me constantly, even though we both measured about 5’8. A ginger with wild red curls, he was a ray of sunshine constantly. His freckled face always wore a smile, and he would do anything for his friends. He took my bag and quickly walked off to put it in the trunk with the rest of the bags that we would be bringing on this last expedition. Merrisa kept hugging me. She was shorter than Justin and me, about 5’4. Her normally dyed hair was in between colors at the moment, with only faded purple at the tips.



“I can’t believe you’re actually leaving us, Anthony!” she said, tears welling up in her eyes. I couldn’t help but sniffle and hug her back tightly. She was like a sister to me, and I cared about her deeply. Justin soon came around and also wrapped his arms around us, pulling us into a deep hug. We all knew this would be the last time we’d see each other and be able to do the thing we all loved to do. I just wish Justin hadn’t picked the hotel. 



He had kept the location a secret even as we drove towards it, only dropping vague hints about it being the greatest location we could’ve hoped to have. The rust bucket was running out of gas on the road, so we quickly pulled into a gas station. At this point, we’d been in the car a few hours already, so Merrisa and I got up to walk around the convenience store, while Justin pumped the car full of gas. 



I looked around the store, not particularly in the mood for any of the options laid out before me, but Merrisa beelined it straight to the energy drinks. As I was looking at the assortment of chips and other snacks, I noticed that Justin wasn’t standing by the car anymore. I looked over and found him at the register. I was going to walk over and ask him if he wanted something, but I quickly overheard him arguing with the gas station attendant, an older black guy. 



“You shouldn’t be heading up there. That place was shut down for a reason, and the last thing we need is a couple of kids digging up bad memories,” he warned, typing on his cash register and pulling out change for Justin. “I’m serious, son. Don’t go up there.” 



“I appreciate the warnings, man. But this is the last time we’ll get to hang out together, and I couldn’t think of a better place than the hotel for us to explore. We aren’t taking anything, and it’s going to be like we were never there to begin with,” Justin explained, putting his wallet back in his pocket and looking towards me, finally noticing that I was listening in. He quickly coughed dramatically and exited the gas station without another word. 



“Poor stupid bastard.” The attendant sighed, staring back down at his counter and just shaking his head. Merrisa quickly walked over and placed her items on the counter, unaware of what had just happened. I left her to pay for her snacks and went over to Justin as he was finishing with the refueling. 



“What was that all about?” I asked him, interrupting him as he replaced the gas cap. He looked at me and then looked behind me to make sure that Merrisa wasn’t close behind me, before pulling me close and whispering to me. 



“We’re exploring an abandoned hotel. A giant one, it was built in the 1910s and then one day just completely abandoned. No clue as to why, or what happened to it. I thought that it was an urban legend or something, but while searching for locations for our last exploration, I stumbled upon a post about someone discovering the hotel.” He pulled me away from the car and pulled his phone out. He pulled up a picture and showed it to me. It showed a blurry picture of what I figured was the hotel we were heading for. 



“Are we sure this place is abandoned? It looks brand new, like they’re going to open again soon.” Indeed, the hotel looked massive, and appeared to have about 12 or 13 floors, and showed no signs of nature having started to reclaim it, no broken windows, not even a tile out of place. It looked immaculate. 



“Crystal, this guy went inside and even took a few pictures of the interior. But you have to pay for those, and I couldn’t be bothered. We might as well go there and see it for ourselves, and it’ll make the perfect final adventure!” He wrapped his arm around my neck and smiled brightly. I was almost convinced, except for what the attendant had said. 



“What did you ask the gas station guy about?” I looked at Justin, and he let go of me, rubbing the curls of red hair on his head. “Were you asking for directions, or something?” I asked, to which Justin shook his head and pulled his phone out to show me the map. It showed that we were only thirty minutes from the approximate location of the hotel. 



“I was just asking if he’d heard about it. Then he started getting all doom and gloom about it. I’m sure he’s just trying to keep us from making a mess of the place. But it’s not like we ever do that.” I was going to question him further, but soon Merrisa joined us with her bags full of snacks, and Justin went to help her, leaving me conflicted about the location. It seemed like a dream come true, an entire hotel for us to explore. But I couldn’t help but think that something horrible lay in wait for us. 



Back on the road, the feeling of dread lingered, but it was soon replaced with joy when at last, after the long car ride jammed in the back of the Grand Am with all the snacks and Justin’s crap, we came to a stop at the edge of some woods. We all exited the car, and in the distance, we could see our destination at last. The hotel rose through the trees like a giant mountain, serving as a lighthouse to guide us. 



I still had reservations about the location, but the sheer size of it, and the possibilities that lay inside finally got the better of me. We all put on our backpacks and made sure the car was locked before we began trekking into the woods towards our destination. Justin quickly found a long stick and used it as a walking stick as we walked through the forest of crunching leaves. It was a slow walk towards the hotel, as the tree roots were hidden beneath the sea of leaves, and every few steps nearly caused us to fall flat on our faces. It seemed like even they were trying to stop us.



 Every few steps, we had to stop and use Justin’s new stick to probe around for any hidden roots. I stared around at the barren forest and couldn’t help but wonder if something was staring back at me unseen. The forest was eerily quiet; only the sound of us walking through the leaves was heard. There wasn’t a single animal around, not even a squirrel. Obviously, there wouldn’t be any birds this late into autumn, but the sheer silence of the forest unnerved me, and I again began to wonder if we should just turn back. 



But at last, we reached the hotel. It was surrounded by a chain link fence with razor wire on the top of the entire perimeter. “There should be a section of fence that got cut out for us,” Justin said, starting to look around at the fence to find it. Merrisa went over to help him while I continued staring up at the hotel. It looked so beautiful, and I couldn’t help but feel that every room in there was probably more expensive than I could ever hope to afford. My previous fears began to evaporate as I began to think of the possibilities waiting for us inside. 



“Found it!” Justin called out, pulling a few piles of leaves away and revealing a section of fence that had indeed been cut. I assumed the previous explorer had made it and left it for others like us to find. Justin took his backpack off and shoved it through the hole before crawling in after it. Merrisa went next, making sure not to snag her puffy jacket on the fence, and then finally it was my turn. I hesitated a moment, those final shreds of apprehension returning as I stared at the fence. 



“C’mon, Anthony! We haven’t got all day!” Merrisa called out as she and Justin put their backpacks back on and began to approach the hotel entrance. I took a deep breath and slipped my backpack off, pushing it through the hole and crawling in after it. Slipping it back on, I quickly raced after them as they walked up to the door. Trying to open it, we found it locked and began searching for a way inside.



“That guy didn’t say how he got inside the hotel?” I asked as I stared at all the windows, hoping that one of them might be cracked or missing. Merrisa was looking around the perimeter as Justin was still trying to get in through the front door, yanking and pulling on it like it was going to do something. 



“I had to pay for further access! I wasn’t about to give that guy 50 bucks.” Justin grunted as he yanked on the door some more, but it seemed to be bolted shut completely. I sighed and looked around further for a way in, almost thankful that the whole trip might have been a bust. That was until I came across a section of the wall that had what appeared to be chalk written on it. 



‘Knock’ was all it said. I stared at it for a moment before looking back over at the door. I walked past this one piece of graffiti and back over to the door, where Merrisa had made her way back to as well to watch Justin act like a monkey pulling on the door. I walked over to the door and simply knocked on it. After a few seconds, the doors loudly unlocked and swung open, sending Justin tumbling down to the floor. 



“How the hell did you do that?!” Justin asked in complete bewilderment. I smiled and shrugged, deciding to keep the secret to myself. I grabbed his arm and yanked him up, and together with Merrisa, we peered into the hotel. What met us was an impenetrable wall of darkness. Justin opened my backpack and pulled out the flashlights I had brought. Once they were distributed to the three of us, we flicked them on and entered the hotel. 



It felt like our flashlights barely penetrated the supreme darkness that ruled inside the hotel. What little we could see of them revealed that the outside wasn’t a facade. The inside was just as immaculate as the outside was, maybe even more so. The carpets looked like they were made of velvet, and the walls were hung with expensive-looking pieces that I was surprised were still hung up. In fact, everything inside looked like it belonged in a museum. We cautiously approached the front desk, and Justin couldn’t help but ring the bell. Its ring was crisp and loud, breaking the silence of the hotel with a loud, deafening ding. 



“Oops, I didn’t think it was going to be that loud.” He giggled, before I punched him in his arm. Merrisa was completely in love with the hotel, as she ran around the giant lobby looking at every inch of art and furniture that she could see. Justin went over to make sure she didn’t get any ideas of taking something with her. I stayed by the desk and looked around, noticing a wall of keys stationed behind the front desk. They were metal keys, and not a single speck of rust existed on them. 



Once Justin had managed to pull Merrisa away from the fancy furniture, we continued through the lobby, heading towards what we figured was the dining room. Even here, everything was spotless and perfect. Not a cobweb, speck of dust, absolutely nothing. Instead of urban exploring, it felt like we had just broken into a hotel that was shut down for renovations. Merrisa and Justin marveled at the set tables, completed with napkins folded into the shape of a swan. 



I started making my way over towards the kitchen when I began to smell food. Not rotting food, actual edible smelling food. Walking to the kitchen, I shone my light through the door and was amazed to find an entire spread of breakfast foods staring back at me. Perfectly done toast, cups of coffee that still had steam coming up from them, eggs done in any style you could think of, all of it looked like it had just been made a few minutes ago. 



“Guys? There’s food over here.” I called out to them. “Like, actual hot food.” They came over quickly and were stunned to see that I wasn’t joking. Merrisa picked up a small pitcher filled with milk and found that it was cold, and the milk wasn’t curdled or spoiled in any way. Justin picked up a cup of coffee and found that it was piping hot. 



“What the hell? Is this place actually open? Or is there like a meeting taking place soon?” Justin asked, placing the cup of coffee back on the service table. 



“Why would they be serving breakfast at 3 in the afternoon?” I asked him. I stared at the food before shaking my head and walking away from it. This was getting too weird, and that nagging feeling of not belonging here began to rear its ugly head back at me. I could tell Justin and Merrisa were also freaked out, but they continued on regardless. 



I followed after them, now painfully aware of how quiet the hotel was. Not a creak, not a groan, not the skitter of rats or anything was coming from the hotel. It was completely silent. I could only hear my own breathing and the sound of our backpacks jingling as we walked. I swear the silence was getting to me, as every few steps we continued down the halls of the hotel, I could feel that something was following us. I stopped every so often to try and see if something was back there. But there wasn’t. 



Eventually, we came upon the ballroom, and Merrisa was again amazed at how beautiful it was. A giant crystal chandelier swung overhead, and when we shone our flashlights on it, it cast a gorgeous array of colors across the floor and walls. We split up again to look around the room, with Justin sticking close to Merrisa. I walked over to the wall to examine what looked like photographs on it. But when I looked at them, I couldn’t tell what they were supposed to be. They were completely smudged, and at first, I thought they were covered in a layer of dust, but they were just strangely smudged. 



“Anthony! Come over here and help Justin! We found a mirror!” Merrisa called over to me. I looked back and nodded, quickly running over and dodging all the chairs and tables to where the two of them were. They were in the middle of the ballroom under the chandelier, and there Justin was pushing an object into place. It was covered with a thick cloth, but it was about six feet tall and had the dimensions I’d expect a mirror to be. 



Justin finally got it into place and came around the mirror to join us before he dramatically pulled the cloth off the mirror to present it to us. Shining our lights away from the mirror just enough to illuminate it, we were greeted by a tall silver-framed mirror. The silver was beautifully engraved with flowers and other designs. We stared at ourselves in the mirror, and I was amazed again that not a single speck of dust touched its brilliant surface. 



I stared at my reflection, my face soft and with the harsh cheekbones that Merrisa constantly told me made me look like an angry old man when I concentrated too hard. My short hair, slightly messy after all the crawling and sitting in the back of Justin’s car. My brown skin with several moles covering my face, it was me, alright. Until it started to not be me. Because I knew for a fact I wasn’t smiling that wide. And I was probably right in assuming that neither was Justin nor Merrisa. 



“What the hell?” I asked, as before our eyes, our reflections began to twist and turn into elongated versions of ourselves. It looked like some unseen force had grabbed our reflections and begun to stretch them into long, gangly versions of ourselves. It would’ve been bad enough that this was happening, but then my reflection pushed its face against the mirror and began to emerge from inside of it. 



“Oh my God!” Merrisa screamed as she quickly grabbed Justin’s arm and began to run away from the mirror. I quickly followed after them as I heard the creature fall to the floor behind us. We made it to the door to the ballroom and quickly turned to leave. Out of the corner of my eyes, I saw the other two reflections begin to emerge from the mirror as well. 



“What the hell was that mirror?!” Justin asked as we sprinted into the lobby and made a beeline to the front door. We would have to figure it out later once we were back to safety, but when we tried to open the door, we found that somehow it had now locked from the outside. I quickly shone the light on the door handles, and to our horror, we saw that there was no lock mechanism. I tried knocking, hoping that it might work, but this time the doors remained shut tightly. 



Suddenly, from behind us, we heard fast scurrying. The three of us turned around and shone our lights back in the direction of the ballroom. Merrisa screamed when she saw my reflection sprinting towards us at full sprint. It ran on all fours like some kind of big cat predator. And in an instant, it lunged at us. I quickly shoved both Justin and Merrisa away, slamming us into the ground as I shoved them to the side. 



My reflection crashed into the door with a loud crack, which I hoped might break the door. Instead, I watched as its long neck dangled to the side of its torso. I thought for a moment it had broken its neck. That was until its milky white eyes turned to look at us, and a giant, toothy smile spread across its face. It flopped its neck back into place and began to laugh at us. A high-pitched laugh that somehow both matched and didn’t match with its long twisted body. 



“Run!” I screamed at Merrisa and Justin. They quickly scrambled up to their feet and began running towards another hallway, one filled with hotel rooms. I followed after them as the creature that looked like me continued to laugh. And suddenly I heard several other pairs of legs following after us. 



“There! Stairs at the end of the hall!” Justin shouted. Shining my light down the hall, I saw that indeed, there was a door leading to a set of stairs. Justin raced ahead and quickly swung the door open. Merrisa ran through, and I heard her start to run up the stairs at full sprint. I quickly tried to follow after her, and as I reached to door, I could tell by Justin’s face and the sounds coming from behind me, that those things were right behind me. 



I quickly ran to the stairs and turned to see if Justin was following after me. Just as I watched him enter the stairwell, a gangly arm grabbed his legs and yanked him back out into the hall. I watched in horror as he was dragged back into the hall and as the creatures began to laugh together. 



I looked back up the stairs to see if Merrisa was still there, but I could see her light high up the stairwell; it seemed in a blind panic, she had kept running and running. I heard Justin grunting and fighting and knew I had to do something. I quickly ran into the hall and saw that Justin was desperately clinging to the doorframe, desperately trying to kick the creatures away from him. The one that looked like him was the one who had grabbed his leg and was currently trying to pull the rest of Justin towards him. I quickly grabbed onto Justin’s arms and tried to pull him back into the stairwell. 



“Hold on, man!” I shouted at him, trying my best to yank him in. I heard a giggle, and looking up, I saw that the other two reflections were sitting like dogs not too far away, both of them drooling in anticipation. I had to get Justin out, and I did my best to try and pull him, but his mirror version was much stronger than the two of us, and I could feel Justin’s grip on me and the doorframe slipping. 



Then it seemed that the Merrisa reflection grew too bored to wait, because it lunged at Justin’s leg and, in one swift bite, tore his leg off below the knee. I stared in shock as Justin began to bleed from his stump. The world went quiet as I stared at my best friend; it even felt like the world slowed down as I stared at the mirror creatures. Justin’s reflection seemed furious that the Merrisa creature had taken his food, because it immediately ignored us and pounced on her, quickly biting the other end of Justin’s leg and starting to try and tug it away from the Merrisa monster’s mouth. 



I didn’t have time to watch this, so while they were distracted, I quickly pulled Justin back into the stairwell and shut the door behind us. Justin was screaming in pain, and he was bleeding out fast. “Hold on, man!” I shouted at him, quickly ripping my belt off my pants and wrapping it around his leg. I pulled it as tight as I possibly could, hoping to stop as much of the blood as possible. I then took my jacket off and then my t-shirt. I quickly wrapped Justin’s stump as much as I could.



“Justin? Stay with me, brother.” I told him, quickly slapping his face a bit when his screaming stopped. I was worried he’d go into shock, but judging by his breathing and the fact he was reacting slightly to my slaps, it seemed he’d just passed out from the pain. We couldn’t stay here in the stairwell, so I quickly helped Justin up onto his one leg and began dragging and carrying him up the stairs. 



We made it to the fourth floor before I got exhausted from carrying all the weight of both him and the backpacks. I entered the fourth-floor rooms, and I sat Justin down against the wall of the hallway, looking for one of the doors that might be open. There was room after room, but all of them seemed to be locked up tightly. I looked around for a room and saw that the closest one to us was 426. Making a mental note of the room, I turned to Justin. His face was growing pale, and his breathing was getting shallower. 



“Justin? Talk to me here, brother.” I told him, walking over to him and opening one of my bottles of water, quickly splashing him in the face with it. He suddenly shot to life, and just as quickly was about to scream before I covered his mouth with my hand and shushed him. “I know it hurts like a bitch. But I need you to stay as quiet as you can, okay? I need to try and get the key to one of the rooms here. I’ll be right back, okay? I promise you.” He nodded through teary eyes. I gave him the water bottle and also retightened the belt as much as I could, which got a silent grunt and scream of pain from Justin. 



I left the backpacks with him and ventured back down the stairs to the first floor. I placed my ear against the door to see if I could hear the reflections. I didn’t, and so I cautiously opened the door

and stuck my head out into the pitch darkness of the hallway. I reached into my pocket and pulled out my keys as quietly as I could. Gently, I removed my flashlight keychain and cautiously turned it on. The light was enough for me to see a few feet in front of me, so I began to walk down the hallway.



There were stains of blood everywhere on the carpet, and I figured that the reflections must have gotten into a fight over Justin’s leg. The deafening silence once again began to play tricks on me. I couldn’t be sure if it was my mind doing something or if it was one of the monsters. But my friend was bleeding out, and I needed to hurry, so I started running to the front desk, all the while hearing strange noises coming from somewhere near me. I did my best to ignore it, reaching the desk and quickly jumping over it to the other side. 



Staring at the wall of keys, I found the key for Room 426. I swiped it and began my journey back down the hall towards the stairwell. As I did so, that strange noise continued to follow me. I stopped every few steps, and it seemed to stop as well. I shone my light behind me, but there wasn’t anything back there. I swallowed the bile building up in my throat and quickly made my way to the stairwell, still being followed by the strange noise. 



When I finally arrived at the door, I reached my arm out to open it, and as I did, I felt a wet sticky substance fall from the ceiling onto my hand. The ceiling. I stood frozen for a moment before I stared back up and saw that my own reflection was staring back at me. It was hanging from the ceiling and drooling at the sight of me. I quickly opened the door and slammed it behind me just as my reflection dropped down and tried to break down the door. I sprinted up the stairs, staring down at the steps in horror when I saw that Justin had left a trail of blood the entire way up to the 4th floor. But I didn’t have time to think of that, I had to get him to safety first. I burst out onto the 4th floor and was thankful to see that Justin was still alive and conscious. 



I quickly ran to the room and inserted the key, getting the door open before running back and lifting Justin back up to his foot, and helping him into the room. I quickly also tossed out backpacks into the room, before closing and locking it behind me. Panting and completely out of breath, I slid down the door and panted on the floor for a few seconds. But I didn’t have too long to wait and catch my breath. I quickly got back up and tended to Justin’s wound. 



“W-where’s Merrisa?” He grunted in pain as I retightened the tourniquet I’d made for him. I opened my backpack and quickly pulled out the first aid kit. It paid to have a mom who was a nurse, because she always made sure that we had a first aid kit and that we would have everything we needed inside it. 



“I don’t know, she ran further upstairs. After I clean your wound, I’ll go looking for her, okay?” I told him, and he nodded, wincing in pain. I knew he was in pain, but what I was about to do was probably going to be much more painful. I held up the bottle of rubbing alcohol to him. He stared at me for a moment before nodding. I walked over and got as many towels as the room had in stock before offering him one to bite into. He bit down on it before nodding at me. I pulled off my t-shirt from his leg stump and quickly began to douse the stump in alcohol. 



Justin screamed and grunted in pain, smashing his fist into the mattress and convulsing in pain. I felt horrible doing this to him, but I had to make sure he didn’t get infected from the wound. I used one of the bottles of water to wet the towel and began to clean his wound to the best of my ability. The beautifully white towels were soon stained a deep red, along with the mattress covers. After I had cleaned up his wound, I used gauze from the first aid kit to wrap up his stump. 



“That’s the best I can do for right now,” I told him, and he nodded, panting in pain with tears streaming down his face. I looked around the hotel room we’d run into in a panic. It was beautiful and even had a minifridge. 



“Merrisa…please, go find her, Anthony. I’ll be okay here,” he told me through a quivering voice. I wasn’t sure if I believed him, but I knew I had to go find her as well. I nodded, checking his tourniquet again, before wrapping my arms and hugging him tightly. 



“I’m coming right back, okay? Try to stay awake and whatever you do, don’t make any noises.” I patted him on the back before taking my backpack and pulling out an extra shirt I had packed. Pulling it over my head and then putting my backpack on, I waved goodbye to Justin and softly exited into the hall. I let out a shaky sigh, wondering how it had all fallen apart so quickly. But I didn’t have time to think about that, I had to find Merrisa. As I exited out into the stairwell, I shone my flashlight down the stairs and came face to face with my reflection. It was busy licking up all the blood that Justin had left behind. 



“Shit!” I screamed as it looked up at me with a smile and a high-pitched giggle. I started to run up the stairs, with the sounds of the reflection following close behind me. I panted hard, suddenly realizing how exhausted I was, as I began to slow down while sprinting up the stairs, while my reflection was easily keeping up with me. Suddenly, I came upon an open door on the 7th floor. Merrisa had to have gone through there, so I pulled my backpack off and spun on my heel to face my reflection. 



Just as it turned the corner, I swung my backpack against its face. Caught off balance and seemingly by surprise, it tumbled back down to the floor and down the flights of stairs it had just run up. Panting hard, I felt a violent need to throw up, but I managed to keep it down before entering the hallway of the 7th floor. I shone my light around the hall, looking for any sign of Merrisa. I soon stumbled upon her. What was left of her.



Her reflection and Justin’s were in the middle of devouring the last few pieces of her. Her head lay on the floor, cracked open and oozing out brains and blood. The reflections were digging into her torso, and when Justin’s reflection yanked out her intestines, Merrisa’s reflection, which had been snapping bones in half and sucking the marrow out, turned to Justin’s reflection and pounced on it, snarling and growling and trying to yank the intestines out of the reflection of Justin’s mouth. 



They were so busy trying to yank on the intestines that they paid no notice to me. All I could do was stare at Merrisa’s eviscerated corpse and turn to leave. I made my way back towards the stairwell, but thinking my reflection was probably making its way back up after me, I decided instead to keep walking down the hall, hoping to find the stairwell on the other end of the hall. Eventually, I found it and began to make my way back down to the 4th floor. 



Before I entered the hallway, I sat down on the stairs and began to cry uncontrollably into my hands. What was I going to tell Justin? Justin…the blood trail. A horrible feeling fell into my stomach, and I quickly shot back up and began sprinting towards the room I had left Justin in. And to my horror, I saw that the door was broken down. 



“Justin!” I screamed, heading into the room, and screaming in anguish when I saw that my reflection was in the process of ripping into Justin’s flesh. It snapped its head over to look at me and growled at me. I saw that Justin had managed to stab it with a pocket knife several times, and the knife was now sticking out of my reflection’s eye. “You piece of shit!” I screamed at it, wanting to tackle my horrifying doppelganger and rip him to shreds myself. But all it did was stare at me and giggle, and I realized that its giggles sounded like a hyena’s. And soon, down the hall, I heard two other giggles. Flashing my light down the hall, I saw that Merrisa and Justin’s reflection had followed me down the stairs and into the hall. 



I had to do something. As they slowly stalked towards me, giggling and licking their gore-covered faces, I dug into my backpack and found two items that were my best chance a survival. The bottle of rubbing alcohol and my road flare. Leaving my flashlight on the floor, I quickly lit the flare and shone it towards the reflections of Merrisa and Justin. They stopped in their tracks and yipped and screeched in terror at the sudden blinding light and loud hissing that the flare made. 



I slowly began to back up towards the stairwell, carefully unscrewing the cap of the bottle of rubbing alcohol. My reflection, seemingly done with eating Justin, exited out into the hallway and also began to follow after me, keeping a safe distance from the flare, but slowly following me as I continued to back up. Making it to the stairwell, I quickly turned and ran down the stairs, followed quickly after by the three reflections. When I reached the bottom, I turned and threw the bottle of alcohol at them. It caught them off guard as they hissed and growled at me. But a moment later, I threw the flare at them, and they went up in a blinding orange flame. 



They screeched in an earsplitting scream and quickly began to claw at themselves and at each other as they burned. I quickly closed the door to the stairwell and shoved myself against it as they tried in vain to escape. I stayed there until the screams finally stopped, and slowly opening the door, I was met with the scene of the charred corpses becoming horribly twisted and mangled together as they burned brightly together. 



I closed the door to the stairwell and slowly began to make my way to the lobby, before I collapsed to the floor in exhaustion. I don’t know how, but eventually I woke up in an intensive care unit. From what they told me, I’d been found alone in the woods, rambling and screaming incoherently. They thought I was on drugs, but when I was brought to the hospital, they found that I had none in my system. 



They also found Justin’s car, and he and Merrisa were declared missing people. I tried to tell the police about the hotel, the mirror, and the reflections of us that had spawned from the mirror. But they didn’t believe me, they thought I had something to do with it, they were sure I’d done something to Justin and Merrisa in a drug-fueled state. They locked me in a psych ward because of what I keep saying. 



The one saving grace of being here is that there are no mirrors in my room. I don’t think I could ever bear to see my own reflection ever again.

Her scale hasn’t arrived yet, but visually the double dose doesn’t even look like enough to be a single. The only way to get the basket to look even close to properly filled is to grind very coarse. 3 is where it looks like most people run them on the internet but I have to run it at 6 or 7 for it to “look right.” At those settings the coffee has a sandy feel.

Thanks for taking the time to read this!

I am based on the east coast but am a frequent business traveler to SF, coming to town monthly for 4-5 day stints including some weekend stopovers.  I will next be in town Dec 3-7.  I can host in my upscale downtown hotel.

I’m here often enough that I’d like to find a local connection - something easy and without strings.  I’d love to find someone I can be flirty and playful with.  I’d love to grab coffee or a cocktail, or enjoy a dinner date.  Maybe check out a weekend market or go on a hike? 

Something fun where we can hang out, flirt, and see where things go without feeling forced or rushed.  I’m someone who likes to build playful tension and release it explosively when the time’s right.

Physically: I am tall (6ft4 - come climb me like a tree!) and in decent shape.  I’m no gym rat but I do regular bootcamp style exercises.  I’m handsome and well put together.  I am well endowed but won’t assault your eyes with unwelcome anatomical photographs.  

Personality: I’m an educated professional, normal, sane, and respectful of your time and your boundaries.  I’m kind, easy-going, funny, and quick to smile.  I’m playful and flirty.

Interests: Outside of work I’m a traveler who takes several international trips every year. I’ve visited over forty countries and love being outside of my element. I am an experienced home chef and love spending time in the kitchen. I hike and bike. I love drinking bourbon next to a campfire.

Bedroom stuff: I am drug, drama, and disease free and ask that you be also - especially the drama and disease part.  I’m 420 friendly.  I’m not too concerned about your personal situation, we’re all adults here and I’m not looking to be indiscreet with whatever you may have sensitivities about.

I’m into both vanilla connections and kinky ones. I am very sex positive and kink-friendly, so articulate your needs and curiosities without hesitation or shame. I try to be a walking safe space, respectful of boundaries. I get the most sexual satisfaction from my partner having a great time.

Let’s take this online, shall we? If this post caught your attention, please send me a chat and tell me about yourself and what caught your eye. Can’t wait to connect.",1,1764728917.0,polyamoryR4R,1,1.0,False

1pcs2lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/excatholic/comments/1pcs2lq/excatholics_who_are_still_christian_what/,Ex-Catholics who are still Christian- What denomination are you?,"A little about me- 

Baptized Roman Catholic. Deeply religious as a child. Had a crisis of faith after a scandal in my area that affected a close friend of mine and seeing the ugly effects on that person’s life and health. Ended up not getting confirmed which caused a rupture in my family. 

I am also a member of the lgbt community (I’ll leave it at that since honestly I don’t want hate comments- I know this is a friendly sub but you can never be sure) and this is also part of why I left. I prayed, went to conversion therapy, even self injured in an attempt to make it “go away”. 

It did not and I am since recovered. I eventually became a full blown atheist pretty quickly after leaving the church. Unfortunately due to the social climate of where I live (even secular spaces) and my family’s attitudes I have lived a very rough life. I won’t go into detail but I’ve experienced essentially trauma after trauma. My life is stable now and I’ve done therapy and all that but I still live with the things I’ve experienced. 

After a decade of being an atheist (I know there are many here!) Life feels… empty. I miss the sacraments. The coffee hours. Having hope and something to believe in. For various cultural and personal reasons, I find myself wanting to return to saint veneration and Christian spirituality. I find myself collapsing into nihilism and despair without it. I’m making a conscious, intellectual choice to engage with religion again because I think it fills core human needs and helps me connect to my heritage. I’m not interested in a religion vs atheism debate although I respect all beliefs. 

Here is my issue. After over a decade and a half I find myself disillusioned with my identity and lgbt community. I still feel the want to be normal and feel that maybe I brought everything I’ve been through upon myself by insisting on pride, selfishness and sin. I keep hoping I can snap out of it and go back to being someone people could love. Even if I could, it wouldn’t erase my life history. I find myself really susceptible to ex-lgbt narratives and I find myself in really low places still.

I feel drawn to going back to Catholicism because it has a particular psychology that deeply resonates to me in its unique art, music, traditions and liturgy. I also hope that it could fix me somehow and I could be redeemed. 

I also think a healthier thing could be going to a more progressive “high church” atmosphere but I get scared without the authority of the church and I worry they’re right. There’s so many denominations and opinions and I don’t know what to believe. Protestantism is too individualistic to me. Being in a church that is lgbt-affirming feels less serious, like they’re bending to the world and just telling me what I want to hear. 

I’ve honestly experienced just as much damage being in the LGBT community as when I was closeted because I found people to validate unhealthy echo chambers and bad life choices I’m also stepping away from. I feel desperate for some sort of positive guidance and have no idea where to find it. I miss when Sunday school was just about being kind and giving to others.

Idek where to begin, I'm just gonna rant and hopefully something coherent will be eligible in this word vomit.

I really want a relationship. I really really really do. I don't want hookups or sex, I just want someone to hang out with and care for and all that jazz. Idk I want someone to be my number 1 y'know, someone who actually wants me around and has fun with me.
But no matter how hard I try I can never find a relationship.

I have friends. They're okay. No they're good, but they don't come without their issues. I've realized that, with them, nothing i do matters. My suggestions are ignored, my advise is treated like shit. Anything I make and show them is glossed over. Nothing I do matters. And that really sucks. But that's also the case with my family too. They don't really care about anything I do and are always so quick to jump to say that I'm wrong no matter what. They're all so stubborn that they'll latch onto and idea after 3 milliseconds and refuse to change their mind. They judge me for the things I like and I struggle to have real conversations with them, because I know they'll just blame me for it.

Last year I fell hard for this girl. She was the only person in my life who actually seemed like they liked me for me. Unfortunately it was all fake so she could use me for emotionally cheating on her boyfriend. 
I talked to my mom about that, I said it really hurt and I don't know what to do and I need some advice. 
She basically said ""it's your fault she used you, because you never asked if she was in a relationship.""
And that broke me. That made me realize that no matter what, I'm always in the wrong. It doesn't matter if that girl and I did everything together for 4 months. It doesn't matter that she never once mentioned s boyfriend in all of our time together. It's my fault. All my fault.

Idek man. After that I tried asking out a few more girls, but it all ended the same. I'd say something about myself, they'd go ""ew gross"" and leave. And eventually I just gave up. I havtn been on a date since March of last year and I feel so hopeless.

It just seems that no matter what I do, I'm either, invisible, stupid, or worthless. 

I don't even like wierd things, I like dinosaurs, I like Nintendo games, I like drawing, I like 3d modeling and printing. That's all pretty normal right? 

Yet anytime I mention it I'm either a corporate sellout or autistic just because I say I like dinosaurs.

Idek. I don't talk to strangers anymore. First off I have nothing to say, and second even if I did, they're not gonna like me.

I really don't get it. Am I actually a horrible person and that's why nobody likes me? Or am I just unlucky.
I don't think I'm a bad person, but what the hell do I know.

I've tried therapy, but it doesn't work. I have to wait 2 weeks just to talk for 45 minutes, and for my therapists to half pay attention. I've tied 2 so far and have had the same result.

Honestly I'm loosing hope. I'm so terrified of graduating college alone. Like I don't want to go out into the real world alone. I want to have someone to experience it with, someone to make mistakes with and figure out solutions. Just someone on my side y'know. But it's not looking good.

I haven't even held hands with a girl. 

Idek man, I never had silly fling in high school, I never had a one night stand. I've never gotten an ounce of real positive attention from someone. Never.
And that's just lead me to believe that I'm worthless. 
Like genuinely, if my own mother thinks so little of me, maybe it's true.

And this goes back to my earlier point, maybe I am a shitty human being and I just don't know it.

Idk man. I just really don't know.

And I'm not saying I want some perfect angle to come in and fix my life, that's unrealistic. But I at least want someone to actually want me. I want someone to show me that it is possible to be loved, and not just some far off fantasy.

Idk man, I'm terrified of not getting a job. My major is animation, and it's impossible on a good day to get hired. The industry sucks ass right now. I have backup plans, but even if I do get a job and a house and money, if I'm doing it alone, I'm going to hate it.

Idk I just want connection and I can't seem to find it anywhere. Clubs don't work, sitting in the library or coffee shops doesn't work. Thers nobody in my major. I don't have a car so I cant go anywhere special. There's nobody at my jobs. 

I read some stories of people joking about how they missed ques that women liked them. And I thought about it and realized that nobody ever has said anything remotely similar to me. They just ignore me. I'm a secondary friend. A backup. 

Yeah idk that's kinda the end of the rant.

I really don't know what to do.",11,1764728643.0,whatdoIdo,10,1.0,False
