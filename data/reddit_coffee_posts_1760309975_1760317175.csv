Today was a Sunday, which is our busiest day of the week because we are next to 3 churches. In the morning we start with six people (we do not need that many people on a weekend at 5am) and when I come in we have 3. When I come in at 10 mass gets out for all 3 churches, so everyone comes to us for a snack afterwards. The problem is, at 10, only 3 of us are left. 

Me, on hot or iced lattes, one person on window, and another person on frappes. It is hard for me to step away to do my tasks because we are so busy from 10am-3pm. 

At 11am, another barista left, so I had to shove my frappe barista on window. We were still very busy, so I could not step away to do shift lead things like making cold brew, pulling food for the next day, etc. 

When night shift came in I let the night shift lead know that I didn‚Äôt complete everything. I clocked out, and CONTINUED TO WORK. I cleaned up the wreck of a store, finished dishes, and began pulling food‚Ä¶ until my manager caught me while he was looking at the cameras. 

He called me and told me to go home. So I went home thinking everything was fine and dandy. 4 hours later, I get a text from a group chat with my manager, general manager, and the night shift lead. They asked why I didn‚Äôt get everything done. I explained myself, stating I wasn‚Äôt comfortable leaving a single person alone to make drinks in the middle of a church rush, and per their request I kept one person on window and left myself to make drinks. I also stated that I could not find time to step away, and that was the reason why I had stayed late. It has been 2 hours since and they have all left me on read. 

Many people have done what I did today, including one of our assistant managers, and I feel like I am being singled out. What should I do?",1,1760316895.0,hatemyjob,0,1.0,False

1o55tm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1o55tm2/getting_enough/,Getting Enough,"Hello all! I'd like to recap my 3 month journey (just for fun and maybe help another new user or spark conversation) and ask a question!

First shot: July 26, did 5 shots at 2.5, 6 shots at 5mg with the 7th being this upcoming Thurs. I am not keen on the daily weighing I see most users do - if it works for you, great - I do not want to create an unhealthy relationship with a scale or become obsessed with making micro adjustments in the name of a pound. I have a healthy weight goal in mind but most of my goals are 'NSV's - lower cholesterol, fitness goals like touching my toes and jogging my normal walk loop, pull-ups, fitting ALL rollercoasters, finding a good fitting pair of waders, etc. I weighed at my initial appt 5 days before starting Zep (252), weighed again at my 1 month follow up (243), and used a home scale to check around the 2 month mark (230). My diet was the first change I made with initially eliminating eating out, focuses on upping my fiber and protein (though I ate more meat before Zep than I like to now) and lowering caloric and sat fat intake. I worked hard with my therapist over the first month to really face that I had been utterly addicted to food. Zepbound is a miracle in that regard. I don't really think about food at all anymore. I literally eat to keep myself alive or maybe to taste something yummy when invited out. Don't preview restaurant menus. Don't order 2-3 meals at a restaurant because I 'just can't decide and want to try everything'. Don't eat past my full point. Don't get fast food or take out DAILY. I do ~allow~ myself to enjoy things I used to as well like a 400 calorie double cheeseburger from BK or a poke bowl or PubSub or chocolate orange tartlet from Whole Foods. The funny thing is even when I do indulge in those things - I can never finish anyways so who cares! I work in a coffee and breakfast environment and have completely abstained from sandwiches and pastries, syrups that aren't sugar free, and full fat milks! 

I have always injected in my thighs and, while I have not found sufficient peer reviewed data to support my theory, my own experience - and those of some users I've seen on here - this has lead me to theorize that shot site may contribute to the user having fewer side effects (specifically as compared to tummy site use). 

Speaking of side effects: headaches the first week, which I am prone to, and I believe were mostly due to under hydrating, intermittent constipation - easily combatted by higher fiber intake and a dose or two of docusate sodium once a week or two and one need for a vegetable laxative to help get things moving if it gets real bad, which it only did once. The slowed digestion has been hard to adjust to as a very regular pooper prior to Zep. I was always proud to be someone who could pee or poop in relatively the same amount of time and let's just say, my skill and pride in it have waned. 

I also deal with a bit of nausea, which is only debilitating when coupled with a sheer lack of intake for the day. That's my main reason for this post, actually - to inquire about your diets and how you're 'GETTING ENOUGH'. I won't take too much of your time with all the deets but: my work schedule and work type (aaaand my lack of desire to eat due to Zep) lead me to really not be eating for the first 7-10 hours of my day. I down a protein drink otw to work, try to work in a bar, crackers, granola, small snack and that's sometimes genuinely forcing myself to try. My work environment is VERY fast paced, so a 10 or even 30 min break is usually spent catching my breath, drinking water, reading or scrolling to pretend I'm not actually at work for a moment - eating is the farthest from my mind and even when I try I can sometimes only eat a few cheese cubes and a cracker. Now, add that I have been working out 2-3x weekly and walking 10k steps a day/avg. I need more intake, more calories. I want to be HEALTHY on the other side of this, not skinny (though both would be super cool). Do you have any food (the lower effort, the better) recommendations for portions that are hand size at most, will help me get in MORE calories without compromising my low fat, low cholesterol needs? Imagine you could only eat 4-6 items a day with maybe 1 being a truly prepared meal. I don't feel that I am ~wasting away~ but also know I can't keep this up and continue to feel the wonderful motivation and energy I have had since incorporating Zepbound, exercise, and a healthier diet. 

Thank you all and keep going!",3,1760316660.0,Zepbound,0,1.0,False

1o55s9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CMRABusiness/comments/1o55s9b/day_in_the_life_of_a_mailbox_cmra_store_manager/,Day in the life of a Mailbox CMRA Store Manager.,"For those who asked what's it like to manage a Mailbox store? How easy is the job?

My day starts at the Post Office. Getting there at 8:00 am. Yes we go to the Post Office Monday though Saturday. As a CMRA  our contract is that we pickup the from the Post Office for our customers. 

You need to have a car for the job. You pickup mail and packages. Then at 8:15 am to 8:30 am I drive to the store. Then carry all the packages and mail in the store. This is usually another 5 to 10 minutes. Then the tray of letters isn't sorted. So you have to sort all the letters which I do buy.The first number of the mailbox hundreds hundreds two hundred three hundred four thousand five hundred and so on. 

Then you have to make separate piles for letters that don't have numbers on them. Mail , that was mixed in with yours that isn't yours. Letters that may be returned to sender because it's a close mailbox or a name that isn't on that mailbox. 

Star store we scan all the letters. So that's another ten twenty minutes. Then put all the letters away. Use at this time.It's close to opening the store at 9:00 am. Sorry open the front door, pull the blinds , open the windows to the customer service desk, open POS software count the cash.

And hopefully try to get the mail put away by 9:30 am to 10:00 am. Usually FedEx Express and UPS, drop off packages around 9:30 am to 10:00 am. Usually check the packages to make sure they are all ours. 

Then when mail put away I email the scanned letters. Using a program that we manually send each letter. We have to type in the three digit number of their mailbox and it enter.

Usually doing this I have customers coming in and or calling. A lot of juggling has to happen. And then customer comes in that doesn't have their key , you have to get up and grab their mail. Which way is breaks your focus. And if customer remembers their key has a package , you still have to get up and go grab their package from the shelf. Then once the email scans are sent. 

I start checking in customer packages. For mailbox customers I scan their barcode into our system. Type their mailbox number and print out a label to add to their package. 
Then they're packaged , gets put on a shelf if it doesn't fit in their mailbox. Then we take eliminated tag that we write their mailbox number on the number pack.Does they have and what shelf we put it on. This goes in their mailbox.

If the package fits in the mailbox. Then I have to go back into system to note it's in their mailbox. Then check it out. So we don't confuse it that's having a package.
On the shelf.

We also have ups access point customers. Which is a separate system that we have to check packages into. These ones go on a separate shelf but we highlight their names with a highlighter.

We get delivery all day long. 3 different FedEx drivers, UPS, On Trac, DHL, and many others smaller companies you've probably never heard of. 

Then customers will come in to drop off packages. And if it's a DHL package. We have to schedule pick up.  Small task be done. 

I also check over some supplies to see what needs to be ordered. Check emails from customers. 

Review reports on past due mailboxes. Print put renewals and past due notices. I have to pull mail and lock mailboxes for really past due mailboxes. 

Run a an expiring ID report. To see which customers need to give us update IDs and email them. Upload customers files to the Post Office online portal. 

Making keys for the after hours door. Checking mailboxes that are closed to make copies of keys if we only have 1 key. Cleaning closed mailboxes and printing a new label for them with the mailbox number. 

Making updated labels for customers mailboxes as some labels are old or outdated information. A person not on the mailbox or a business they don't have anymore. 

Doing return to sender mail. This involves taking permit marker blacking call the intelligent barcode if the letter has it. Neatly crossing out the address. And writing a return code for why we're doing return to sender. These letters have to be handed separately to the Post Office and can't be given without going mail.As it's sorted differently.

Also , do the look up for no number letters. This one's involved using a stamp that we step each letter. Bring the customers mailbox number on it. Either by memory or by looking up. And forecast that continuously don't fix their address. We will personally email them telling them 26 the address. 

There's also the duties of wiping down the counters, sweeping the store and cleaning the windows and doors. We also have a meeting room that we rent out. We also need to be freshened up. Sweeping wiping, down the table cleaning the coffee maker. Taking the trash out. Checking the supplies for the meeting room. Does the paper have paper? Is there water üíß and coffee ‚òïÔ∏è for the coffee machine? Does the remote battery üîã work for tv üì∫ remote? Is the dry erase board clean and have markers?

One a week water üíß the ü™¥ in the store. Clean the outside of the mailboxes üì¨. Deal with any customer issues. Or try to figure out questions that I don't have the answer to. 

There's many , many , many more things, but this is just the day in the life. I don't do all this everyday. I do must of it and other things. 

What I love about this job is. You get to the build rapport with your customers. You get to know them and their families. Even though every day have a typical routine. There could always be something unique that happens. I've built so many different processes and procedures for the store. Go to create lot of business applications. Using Google forums and sheets or employee only website for information on running the store and dealing with issues. 

Also came up with ideas üí° to make softwares or apps for CRMAs. That I unfortunately computer science background , to create these by myself. Don't have the time to learn how to create these complex of softwares. 

That just makes me want to work in a operational role or a IT role to find better ways to help employees and customers. ",1,1760316547.0,CMRABusiness,0,1.0,False

1o55q5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1o55q5h/im_contemplating_divorcing_my_husband_because_he/,I‚Äôm contemplating divorcing my husband because he puts his family before me,"I don‚Äôt really like my husband‚Äôs family that much and when I have a problem with something, my husband will always side with them. 

My husband is very family oriented and I am quite the opposite. I have a small family and I see them every so often because I live in a different state. But I‚Äôm ok with that. 

Some of my husband‚Äôs family also live in a different state but they always come to stay at our house because we have guest rooms. Technically 1 but here‚Äôs the story.

Before my husband and I met, his mom lived with him at some point and eventually she moved out but kept her things here like her bed, dresser and random things. 
Not long after we married she asked him if she could move back in. He told her yes but then he asked me and I said absolutely not. I will not live like that. It was an issue. I told him if she moves in then I will move out and he can live happily ever after with his mom. He eventually made something up to her telling her we were moving.  I‚Äôve tried asking if I could make that room into a gym or even a closet or something but no, it‚Äôs his mom‚Äôs room. 

She then goes and moves in with her daughter a state away and she would come to visit more and more often as the years went by. At first it wasn‚Äôt a problem but now I‚Äôm starting to get tired of it. My husband and I now sleep in different bedrooms because he snores very loud now and I‚Äôm a very light sleeper and there‚Äôs another room besides ‚Äúhers‚Äù. So when his family comes, it‚Äôs usually his mom, sister, sister‚Äôs husband and a kid or two and I am forced out of the room I sleep in. Which they are fully aware I sleep in there. 

So now not only do I get no sleep there are too many people in a small house. I‚Äôve started not to like them coming here because 1 they gladly take the room I sleep in. 2 they do laundry almost every day so I can‚Äôt do my own and use up almost all of my laundry supplies. 3 they use almost all of my shower products. 4 they come during the work week and 5 they tell us last minute when they decide they want to come. What makes it worse is my husband works long days and I work from home and my husband expects me to cook and entertain. I can‚Äôt entertain, I‚Äôm working and I barely like just cooking for us because I‚Äôm always having to make 2 meals because I‚Äôm a vegetarian and my husband is not so I refuse to cook for that many people. They can help themselves and they usually do but because I don‚Äôt do those things my husband thinks I‚Äôm not a good person and I‚Äôm mean to his family. 

More recently, like currently, his mom decides she wants to come and tells us 3 days in advance. This was the weekend of my husbands birthday and I had surprise plans for him which I had to cancel because she wanted to come. I was livid and instead of him telling his mom not to come because his wife has plans for him he try‚Äôs to make excuses that he doesn‚Äôt want to do the things I planned. So then I come to find out she wants to stay for a week. At that point I‚Äôm like no because now my husband and I are fighting and there will be another person here and it‚Äôs just not ok to me. Again during the work week and at that point she wasn‚Äôt even here to spend time with him because my husband worked all week long from morning until about 10 pm. It was absolutely ridiculous. I just kept to myself. After a week she hadn‚Äôt left and I asked my husband when she was leaving. He kept telling me he didn‚Äôt know. So I told him I need to know. It‚Äôs awkward and I want normal life back. This turned into more of an argument and he yelled back at that his mom can stay however long she wants. This is even after I tell him that it‚Äôs an over stay and that I‚Äôm uncomfortable. Doesn‚Äôt matter, I‚Äôm the problem. 

So now after about 8 days she takes off to my husband‚Äôs brothers house but she left most of her things here. For instance a lot of her clothes and a coffee maker. Yes, she makes coffee in the room. So I asked my husband why her things were still here and he again said he didn‚Äôt know. So I keep asking questions because I want to know if she‚Äôs coming back but we got into an argument again because now she left because I made her feel uncomfortable and again I‚Äôm the problem. All I asked was why her stuff was still here if she‚Äôs staying somewhere else, not knowing if she would be back to stay here. 

His family are not bad people and can be nice but to me his family is very tone deaf and can be very inconsiderate. I‚Äôm guessing they are just used to living with no boundaries. I have plenty but it‚Äôs unacceptable in my husband‚Äôs eyes. 
I like my space, I‚Äôm an introvert and I like plans. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs too much to ask for.

I‚Äôm growing tired of his family coming before me. Should I leave or is he in the right?

1o55hll,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o55hll/rf_embers_of_a_life/,[RF] Embers of a Life,"Birchwood Springs sounded like a place you moved to after you‚Äôd done the math. It had a gate, a guard who waved whether he knew you or not, lawns that cooperated, and a pond with a stone sign that insisted it was a lake. The name was real enough‚Äîthere were a few birches left along the water and springs trickled through a culvert beneath the walking path‚Äîbut mostly it was the kind of suburb where things pretended to be permanent. 
Robert Pennington was good at pretending to be permanent. He was thirty-two and looked, by every ordinary measure, fine. He had kept the same haircut since he was twenty, close on the sides, tidy on the top. His shirts were always ironed, his shoes always somewhere between brown and black, like he couldn‚Äôt commit to either. He worked in an office just off the highway, doing compliance for a logistics company. He started at nine, left at five, ate a salad at his desk, and let the radio talk to him on the drive home. Robert could make a spreadsheet do anything except explain life. 
Two months earlier, after an abdominal ache that he tried to ignore but couldn‚Äôt, and a blur of tests, a man with tired eyes in a white coat told him he had pancreatic cancer, late and uncooperative. 
‚ÄúMonths,‚Äù the doctor had said. ‚ÄúMaybe more, maybe less. We can discuss options.‚Äù
He had nodded, because there didn‚Äôt seem to be anything else to do. It was a clean, brutal answer. He went back to work the next day. He paid his mortgage. He sorted the mail. He scrubbed the sink. If anything, he became more himself‚Äîtidy, punctual, steady‚Äîas though organizing the edges would keep the middle from falling in. 
He did not start a bucket list because he didn't have one. His ambitions had never been dramatic. He hadn‚Äôt dreamed of oceans to cross or trophies to hoist. He had wanted, mostly, to be loved‚Äînot in the cinematic way, but in the small, domestic way that meant a second toothbrush next to his, a coffee mug left on the counter, a text about picking up milk on the way home. He had dated in high school and again in college, but nothing ever lasted. It wasn‚Äôt because he was awkward, weird, or unkind. He had just simply never found the one.
When he was a kid, his parents had made a sport out of leaving. His father had three marriages. Robert was the middle child from the second. Holidays were negotiations with a scoreboard. After the divorce, he became an item passed back and forth until the game stopped being fun. At eighteen, he moved out. After that, no one called, ever. 
His siblings lived their own busy lives. There were six of them in total. Robert was the only kid who came from the second marriage, so he often felt like they weren‚Äôt even his brothers and sisters. He sent polite texts for birthdays. Sometimes he got emojis back. When he found the lump, he told no one. He didn‚Äôt need anyone to act like they cared. 
On a Thursday in October, a coolness had slowly crept into Birchwood Springs. It was that time of the year when you could start to slowly bring out jackets, crew necks, and sweatpants. Robert had a date after work with a woman named Kara, whom he had met on a dating app. They went out to a fancy neighborhood wine bar. She was kind in the thin way of strangers being kind. She asked what he did. He explained compliance and watched her nod while her eyes slowly drifted away from him. She told him she fostered dogs and worked in design. He told a lie and said he used to help out at the animal shelter back in high school, doing anything to seem more interesting.
They split a cheese plate, and he got her to laugh once. When the check came, he laid down his card and paid for her. She thanked him, and once they made their way to the door, she touched his arm as a polite closing gesture. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nice,‚Äù she said, and smiled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll find someone.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThanks for meeting me,‚Äù Robert said, and meant it, and also wanted to ask her if she thought ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù was a real person or a hope people said to be merciful. He didn‚Äôt ask, of course. He walked out into the October evening and pulled his coat closer, then started the short way home. The guard at the gate lifted a hand as he passed on foot. The pond‚Äîlake‚Äîkept still. From far away, sirens murmured to themselves. 
His house sat two blocks in, a small two-story with a struggling maple in the yard and a porch light that kept on a timer. The route curved along the water, then rose slightly to a row of homes that lined a back street. Halfway up the gentle hill, he smelled something wrong.
It was faint at first, a sour sweetness beneath the leaf smoke of the season. Then he saw the smear of orange in the corner of his vision, and when he turned, there it was‚Äîthe house on the corner with the blue shutters, breathing fire. 
For a second, he just stood there, the way you do when your brain insists that the thing you see cannot be the thing you see. Then a window cracked, a sound like a bat splitting on an inside pitch, and heat surged across the sidewalk. Somewhere inside, a smoke alarm screamed in a flailing cry for help. Robert started to run. 
‚ÄúHey!‚Äù he shouted, though at who, he didn‚Äôt know. He pounded up the front steps and tried the door. The knob burned his palm and yanked his hand back, hissing. He lowered his shoulder, pulled his sleeve over his hand, and pushed.
The door gave. Black smoke rushed out like a tide, hot and choking. He hit the floor without thinking. He did all he could to collect his thoughts as he began crawling on the floor because the air was better low. 
‚ÄúHello?‚Äù he called out, his mouth covered by his shirt. ‚ÄúIs anyone there?‚Äù
‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù A woman‚Äôs voice rang out from above. ‚ÄúPlease‚Äîsomeone‚Äîmy daughter‚Äî‚Äù
He moved toward the sound. On the wall, he saw family photos revealed by the firelight. It showed a woman in her thirties with a wild brown ponytail and a little girl in a pink dress. The stairwell in front of him glowed in the color of autumn. 
‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù he shouted. 
‚ÄúUpstairs! The hallway!‚Äù Coughs stabbed through the words. 
He crawled until he found the first step, then he stood because he had to. Heat wrapped around him. Smoke clawed at his eyes. He climbed, counting like a child, one, two, three, his hands on the rail, his body pressed to the wall where it was cooler. On the ninth step, a long crack shuddered down the ceiling plaster like a lightning bolt, and ash snowed. 
At the top, he dropped back to his knees and saw two shapes in the gray. The woman crouched by a closed door, a little girl clinging to her back like a koala, her face buried in the woman‚Äôs neck. The woman‚Äôs left hand jerked helplessly at a knob that must have swelled in the heat. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs jammed‚Äù, she coughed. ‚ÄúMy‚Äîm‚Äîmy daughter‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve got you,‚Äù he said, and meant it. He rose, moved to the door, braced a shoulder, and threw his weight. The wood groaned and held. He did it again, harder. Something popped, part of the frame or part of him. The door finally cracked open.
Cooler air poured out from the bedroom. He swallowed it like water. Through the haze, he saw a window and a ledge beyond, leading down to a hedgerow and the side yard. The taste of escape. 
‚ÄúOut there,‚Äù he said, pointing. ‚ÄúYou can go out that way.‚Äù 
The woman turned, still bent over with the child on her back. The girl lifted her face and he saw her big eyes and the glittering sticker stars stuck to her cheek as if this had begun as play. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared,‚Äù she whispered. 
‚ÄòI know,‚Äù Robert said. He had rarely been sure of anything, but he was sure of that. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be brave anyway.‚Äù 
He crossed the room and shouldered the window up as high as it would go. The frame stuck, and splinters bit his palms. Outside, he could hear the fire roaring on and slowly overtaking the rest of the house. The window was up just high enough to squeeze through. Robert knew he couldn‚Äôt fit, but he looked at them and realized they could. 
‚ÄúOn your stomach,‚Äù he said to the woman. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have to crawl through, and then I‚Äôll pass your daughter to you.‚Äù 
The woman nodded, her coughs tearing. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù She swung her legs out and fell onto the ledge. 
‚ÄúOkay, sweetheart.‚Äù Robert crouched so his eyes were level with the little girl‚Äôs. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get you out of here. Your mommy‚Äôs right there.‚Äù
The little girl nodded, eyes wide. He gathered her up, arms under her arms, and pushed her through the window and into her mother‚Äôs reach. Once the woman had her daughter in her grasp, she quickly hopped off the edge and into the hedgerow. It caught her with a soft crash. Robert watched as they disappeared into the yard, finally free from the danger. 
Turning back toward the door, he saw the hallway beyond it bloom in orange. Somewhere deeper in the house, the fire found a pocket of air and laughed. The ceiling above the bedroom moaned. A crack zig-zagged across the plaster like a child‚Äôs drawing of a river. 
The only exit was the window. The path was too thin. The hallway behind him began to flash brighter. He tried to swing one leg through and realized it could never work. The floor trembled, then a report like a cannon boomed from the kitchen. The old gas line had given way. A wave of heat rushed down the hall. The door he‚Äôd shouldered popped wider, and the frame warped. The entire house exhaled in pain. 
Robert drew his leg back into the room on instinct. He shuffled toward the corner as a ceiling beam dropped in slow, terrible grace to land where he had just been, splashing sparks like a fountain. He scrambled as far back into the corner as he could. Smoke thickened from gray to black. The air went thin. He could hear the faint sound of neighbors screaming. Robert took a seat on the floor and realized this would be it. 
All his life he had wanted someone to hold him in the quiet and call him home. He had wanted proof that he mattered, that he was chosen, that he belonged in some small room in someone else‚Äôs plans. He had waited for that love to arrive like a delivery gone missing. 
And then, in his final moments, he finally understood. What he had needed wasn‚Äôt to be loved, but to love‚Äîsolidly, without ledger or return. To put his body between danger and a child, between fear and a mother, to be, for one exact beautiful and ridiculous minute, what the man with the tired eyes in the white coat could not measure. The joy was not in being known by someone but in knowing what he would give for someone. 
This realization wasn‚Äôt noble. It wasn‚Äôt an epiphany with trumpets. It felt like finally exhaling after holding your breath for too long.	Robert pressed his hand against the burning wall and felt his skin sear. He pulled away and let out a short laugh because it seemed funny that pain still worked, that nerves still fired their small fireworks like nothing had changed. 
The smoke got mean and completely engulfed him. The heat rose. The ceiling sagged and then sighed downward, pieces dropping like old promises. He coughed and coughed as he began to feel woozy. His body felt far away, like he was sitting at the end of the long hallway watching himself tip his head back. In the small, collapsing room, he felt like a man who had finally made a choice he was proud of. A smile crossed his face as the room gave in. 
Outside, the night had turned strange‚Äîtoo bright, too loud, a circle of neighbors standing barefoot on their lawns like witnesses of a waking dream. A siren grew teeth and skidded to a stop. The woman staggered out into the street with her daughter attached to her hip, both covered in ash. There were leaves in the woman‚Äôs hair, her knees bleeding thinly through torn jeans. The little girl hiccuped between sobs, the way children do when their bodies are still arguing with fear. 
A cruiser rolled alongside the curb. A woman in navy‚Äîbadge gleaming, braid tucked neat‚Äîwas already moving toward them with a wool blanket folded over her arm. 
‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, are you hurt?‚Äù the officer asked, voice low enough to be a hand on the back. 
The woman tried to answer and found only smoke. She coughed until the world went white at the edges, then nodded and shook her head at the same time. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚ÄîI‚Äôm okay,‚Äù she pulled the blanket around her daughter first, then herself. ‚ÄúWe got out.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù The officer asked.
She continued to cough until the words could escape her mouth. ‚ÄúMay. My daughter is Isabel.‚Äù
The officer pressed the blanket close, eyes flicking to the house where the top floor had collapsed and the windows breathed fire. ‚ÄúOkay, May, is anyone else inside?‚Äù 
‚ÄúA man,‚Äù May said, holding back a downpour of tears. ‚ÄúHe ran in. He got up to the window. He‚Äî‚Äù Her voice broke as the tears began to fall. ‚ÄúHe stayed.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs his name?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù May whispered, furious at herself for not knowing. Men in gear shouldered a line toward the door. Water snapped from their hoses as the steam shot out of the house. ‚ÄúThe man saved my little girl.‚Äù
The officer nodded, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, we call those people heroes.‚Äù
May nodded, tears cutting down her cheeks. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said, voice clear now as the hoses roared and the crowd drew back. ‚ÄúA hero‚Äôs inside.‚Äù

After making it and drinking, masarap pala. I might even like this more than matcha. Low caffeine content din so kahit late in your day na inumin di ka mahihirapan matulog (just like why I like decaf than regular coffee)

4th edition in the annual Diamond Peak release, all featuring cask finishing 

Stranahan‚Äôs partnered with 4 local breweries by sharing ex-Stranahan‚Äôs casks first seasoned their craft beers. The casks were boomeranged back to Stranahan‚Äôs. Each cask was filled with a marriage of 4-6 year old American single malt whiskey and allowed to finish for another 18 months 

Initial barrels previous held Stranahan‚Äôs single malt for 4 years 

Beer casks all held beer for just under a year 

Collaborating Colorado brewers:
Avery Brewing Co. 
River North Brewery
Crooked Stave Brewing Co.
Wild Provisions 

This year‚Äôs Diamond Peak release was primarily finished in ex-Stranahan‚Äôs barrels that were given to Avery Brewing Co‚Ä¶. along with incorporation from the other three brewers 

Mashbill: 100% locally sourced 2-row malted barley 

Malting style: small percentage of caramel & chocolate malts inspired by the initial Flying Dog Brewery mashbill

Length of fermentation: ~5.5 days; closed-top

Double pot still distillation; Vendome 

Proof coming off the still: 140

Initial barrel entry proof: 110

Beer barrel entry proof: ~116

Natural batch proof before reducing: 109.4 (due to residual beer)

Finishing casks held a variety of beer styles:
Belgian style ale 
Imperial & coffee stout 
Barleywine 
Peach ales 

Cut to 90 proof with Rocky Mountain water from Eldorado Springs

MSRP: $79.99

Nose üëÉ: Dark chocolate. Roasted coffee beans. Dried apricot. Sandalwood.

Palate üëÖ: Blackberry jam. Almond butter. Nestle Quick. Coffee. Thick mouthfeel.

Finish üèÅ: Grapefruit pulp. Mocha latte. Cranberry juice.

I think I‚Äôm in love with this one! The beer finishes are beautiful. The chocolate notes shine, but so the fruit notes. Often times, beer finishes cover up the fruit notes, but the fruits are still on full display here. This one is worth every penny and it‚Äôs definitely worthy of being an annual allocated release.

Finishing casks held a variety of beer styles:
Belgian style ale 
Imperial & coffee stout 
Barleywine 
Peach ales 

Cut to 90 proof with Rocky Mountain water from Eldorado Springs

MSRP: $79.99

Palate üëÖ: Blackberry jam. Almond butter. Nestle Quick. Coffee. Thick mouthfeel.

Finish üèÅ: Grapefruit pulp. Mocha latte. Cranberry juice.

I think I‚Äôm in love with this one! The beer finishes are beautiful. The chocolate notes shine, but so the fruit notes. Often times, beer finishes cover up the fruit notes, but the fruits are still on full display here. This one is worth every penny and it‚Äôs definitely worthy of being an annual allocated release.

1o558t0,http://pawsofability.com,The Best first flight with our service dog: People are Amazing!,"When we booked our first flight with my son‚Äôs service dog, Max, I thought I was ready for anything. I‚Äôd done my research, printed every form twice, packed enough snacks and wipes for a small army, and even rehearsed what I‚Äôd say to airline staff. But, like most parents of special needs kids, I knew life rarely goes exactly according to plan.

And honestly? I was both excited and terrified. Flying can be overwhelming for anyone, but for a child with Autism who thrives on routine and calm, airports are like sensory overload central. Add a service dog into the mix, and you‚Äôve got a whole new adventure ahead.

What I didn‚Äôt expect were the moments of grace, surprise, and pride that made this trip one we‚Äôll never forget. These unexpected moments are a testament to the resilience and adaptability of our children, as well as the incredible support that service dogs provide.

# [¬†**The Airport Chaos (and Calm)**](https://www.transportation.gov/resources/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/service-animals#:~:text=Airlines%20are%20required%20to%20recognize%20dogs%20as%20service,for%20passengers%20if%20they%20choose%20to%20do%20so)

Airports are loud. The echo of rolling suitcases, constant announcements, and that weird hum of a hundred conversations happening at once can set anyone‚Äôs nerves on edge. My son was already fidgeting before we even reached the security checkpoint.

But Max ‚Äî our loyal, golden-hearted service dog ‚Äî slipped right into ‚Äúwork mode.‚Äù He guided my son around crowds, helped him stay focused, and even leaned in when the anxiety started to build. Watching that silent communication between them was something magical.

What surprised me most?¬†**The understanding and kindness of TSA.**¬†They gave us extra time, explained every step, and even complimented Max on his calm behavior. I had braced myself for a stressful security check, but it turned out to be one of the easiest parts of our day. Their support was a reassuring reminder that we were not alone in this journey.

# ¬†[**Takeoff Tails and Tiny Triumphs**](https://pawsofability.com/about/)

Once on the plane, I worried about how Max would handle the noise and confined space. But he curled right up under my son‚Äôs seat like a pro ‚Äî as if he‚Äôd been flying his whole life.

My son leaned down, stroked Max‚Äôs fur, and whispered, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs okay, Mom. He‚Äôs brave.‚Äù That tiny sentence melted me.

During takeoff, while my son gripped his headphones and squeezed his fidget, Max rested his head gently on his lap ‚Äî grounding him in a way no words could. The motion, the sound, the lights ‚Äî everything that usually sends him into a tailspin ‚Äî suddenly felt manageable because Max was there.

It was one of those moments when I thought, ‚Äò*This is why we do it.‚Äô This is why service dogs are life-changing.*

# ¬†Reactions from Other Passengers

I was nervous about how people would react. Would they be annoyed? Would they ask questions or try to pet him?

To my surprise, most people were incredibly kind. One woman leaned over and whispered, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even realize there was a dog on board until now ‚Äî he‚Äôs so well-behaved!‚Äù Another passenger smiled and said, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a better flyer than I am.‚Äù These reactions not only reassured me but also helped my son feel more comfortable. It was a powerful reminder that most people really do want to understand-they just need to see service animals in action to appreciate what they do.

Those little moments reminded me that¬†**most people really do want to understand**¬†‚Äî they just need to see service animals in action to appreciate what they do.

# ¬†What We Learned

Looking back, our first flight with Max taught me so much more than how to handle paperwork or navigate TSA. It showed me the beauty of trust ‚Äî between a child and his service dog, between a family and a world that‚Äôs learning to be more inclusive.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôd tell any parent preparing for their first flight:

* **Prepare well**, but don‚Äôt overthink. Dogs feed off your energy ‚Äî if you‚Äôre calm, they‚Äôll be calm.
* **Ask for help.**¬†Most airlines are happy to accommodate if you explain your needs.
* **Celebrate the small wins.**¬†Even making it through security without a meltdown deserves a victory dance (or at least a coffee). These small victories not only boost your morale but also show your child the progress they‚Äôre making. It‚Äôs these moments that make the journey with a service dog not just about travel, but about growth and empowerment.

That flight wasn‚Äôt perfect ‚Äî but it was powerful. It gave my son confidence, showed me how capable Max truly is, and reminded me that every ‚Äúfirst‚Äù is a step toward freedom and independence.

Flying with a service dog isn‚Äôt just travel ‚Äî it‚Äôs teamwork. And for families like ours, it‚Äôs proof that love, patience, and a good pup can make even the most daunting journeys possible.¬†

1o555u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1o555u6/how_should_i_navigate_an_unfortunate/,How should I navigate an unfortunate misunderstanding while protecting my position and remaining respectful?,"Posting here because I can‚Äôt talk about it irl or with anybody so I‚Äôm gonna be very general for the sake of anonymity.

I am an autodidact who could never afford a traditional education. I never stopped seeking knowledge despite being poor and constrained. I spent years studying in my free time and I ended up working on a variety of independent publications. There were a variety of writers we worked closely with, and we shared good relationships with all of them. Using social media to network and publicize our work facilitated a friendly atmosphere. After an upheaval with my day job, I was in a difficult spot financially, so I put out a request for 1099 work to my social media contacts. One of those affiliated writers worked in the nonprofit sphere and responded to my request with a gig, hoping to do me a solid. This was the end of last year.

About one year later I have taken on a variety of jobs for this nonprofit after exceeding expectations on key deliverables. I‚Äôve been able to exercise creative freedom in producing educational content and media; I‚Äôve performed a wide array of research tasks which have given expanded my knowledge base and developed my capacity for data analysis; I‚Äôve learned to use a variety of programs relevant in the professional world; I‚Äôve learned about institutions and key contacts in ways that will benefit my potential for further career opportunities.

Basically it‚Äôs been a dream, and there‚Äôs been talk about future possibilities including pay raises, sponsored access to higher-quality equipment, or full employment. I really see a future with the group. One thing they specialize in is filmmaking and that‚Äôs something I could take part in. I am being offered travel opportunities to universities and meeting scholars. What more could a young autodidact dream of? I thought I‚Äôd never be on a university campus, much less working alongside professors in educational efforts.

The writer (40m)who gave me the job also came from a rougher background and was glad to give me a leg up; he got one early in his career and there‚Äôs a sense he wanted to ‚Äúpass that down.‚Äù He and I have been working as the core directors of a new project for a few months, with him as my supervisor, and it will involve a lot of travel opportunities and close work over the next 3 years. I am excited to work with him as we have a friendly and comradely relationship. He is very intelligent and professional but also warm. He somewhat reminds me of my uncle and I told him that. I met him for the first time in person, as well as the rest of the team about 6 months ago. I would describe all of them as professional and warm. They flew me in to Texas for a staff party. I stayed alone at my hotel and took an uber to a coffee shop where my supervisor had offered to meet me beforehand. He talked to me about what to expect with the group (since it was my first time meeting all of them) and then we talked to the bowling alley together. We all had lots of fun bowing and eating pizza. Everyone told me lots of stories about past years working together. I really felt like part of the team.

So basically it‚Äôs a dream right? Until BAM, last weekend I get a call from my supervisor

His wife thinks we are having an affair

Apparently she read our texts and thought that our friendliness constituted an emotional affair. Now I can‚Äôt overstate how much we have never been anything other than totally upright. Never talked about each others appearance, never speaking about sex or romance even jokingly, never complementing each other beyond our work. We also don‚Äôt have long drawn out conversations very often - less than would be normal with most friendships

He has spoken often in a positive way about his wife and has said before that he‚Äôs excited for me to meet her

When he called me he almost interrogated me about my perception of the relationship and the nature of it which was upsetting because again there‚Äôd never ever been anything weird. We both agreed clearly but it felt almost accusatory. I asked him if I should keep communications to Teams and he said ‚Äúno I have nothing to hide‚Äù but in a weird tone that suggested I was implying otherwise? When really I just was trying to be solution oriented because I was taken aback and this whole thing was groundless anyway (and completely shocking tbh.) Then he told me not to worry about it and that he was working to ‚Äútranscend the whole thing‚Äù

That was one week ago, it‚Äôs the weekend now and he was a bit weird to me the first day of being back to work together but since then has been normal and nice

I need this job a lot. I am 30f and single mom, didn‚Äôt mention til now because I didn‚Äôt want anyone‚Äôs biases to color their perception. It‚Äôs a pathway to an education and career that has been a huge blessing and I‚Äôm scared to lose it. I know we‚Äôve both always acted in propriety but I‚Äôm scared it would be easier to fire me than to deal with the discomfort of his wife being paranoid or misunderstanding our dynamic? Will I lose my opportunities to travel? To progress in this career?

What do I do?!? Thinking about losing this just makes me want to cry. I want this more than anything else I‚Äôve ever considered a possibility for my life and if I lose it, it will be devastating both financially and spiritually ",1,1760314707.0,careerguidance,2,1.0,False

I was honest and told him it made me uncomfortable.

Am I in the wrong for feeling this way? Is that a normal or respectful thing to do in a marriage? Is it weird that he can‚Äôt fathom what a regular stand with a half naked woman looks like?

1o554rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AircraftMechanics/comments/1o554rc/officially_airframe_certified/,Officially airframe certified.,"10/11/25 is a day I‚Äôll never forget. I officially became Airframe certified. 
I been in the helicopter world my whole aviation career. I was blessed to do the apprenticeship route. After I did my time and got sign off to take my written I went to a school for 2 weeks in riverside california. I passed my general and airframe and for whatever reason could not get the power plant down. I left the school after the 2 week class needed with just my G&A writtens completed. I was so drained from just that and was happy to just go home. Everyone knows the writtens are only good for 2 years. The 31st of this month would make 2 years. I didn‚Äôt do jack shit these past 2 years which was dumb asf. I‚Äôm a HUGE procrastinator. So to make my life harder I had to study my ass off for my general and airframe O&P. I work night shift which made it even harder. I‚Äôve lost weight and been on a coffee & energy drink diet for a month straight. I even thought it would be smart to pull an all nighter day before my O&Ps. Nope that shit sucked. But I passed and the feeling I have right now is unexplainable. I will not make the same mistake when I start prepping for this powerplant. But man what a journey it‚Äôs been. This field is not easy and these test are far from easy so everyone with A&Ps or starting this journey, we really need to give ourselves credit sometimes for the things we do/did to get here. 

Few things I‚Äôd recommend to people on here that I had questions about as well:

If you are studying for your writtens, download the app Prepware and test yourself. That app will be your best friend. Also get the ASA knowledge books for all 3 subjects on Amazon. It‚Äôs the same as the prep app but prep app might have a few new questions because it can be updated. BIGGEST advice is know about the things it‚Äôs asking about. I was always told just memorize question and answers but the test is not always the same. Now the test will switch up some keywords and totally flip the answer. Have the knowledge on the subject. 

When you are done with your writtens DO NOT WAIT to take the O&Ps. While the information is still in your head keep going and start looking over the O&P study guides. I used Jeppson and ASA and 8083 on the FAA website. The 8083 will be your best friend because the oral questions are referenced from that book. 

Now the biggest thing I tried to find out was if your O&Ps would be on the codes you got wrong from your writtens and some people said yes and no. KNOW EVERYTHING. that is a lie. The test is random. You will have some questions on the subjects from your codes but that is not your full tests. You actually need to have knowledge on EVERY subject. Yes it‚Äôs hard but it will be worth it. Trust me. 

The DME I had was super cool. I know some that will fail you if you absolutely don‚Äôt answer correctly. But if you are on the right track and dont necessarily answer correct they can kinda guide you back so you think about it again and hopefully answer correctly. Some might not and just fail you. That‚Äôs really just a game of chance. I get nervous for any test I take so I called my DME ahead of time and chatted with him a bit asked to meet with him. See the place I‚Äôm testing and kind of talk to him about my career and goals so when the time comes I‚Äôm not sitting with a stranger. I‚Äôm sitting with someone I opened up to and feel more comfortable with now. 

I only have my airframe but man it feels so good to get that weight off my shoulders and mental. I‚Äôm gonna take a week break to decompress my brain and then start the powerplant but I just wanted to share my experience and answer some questions I had that I seen before I took my O&Ps for the first time.

1o553op,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1o553op/aita_for_wanting_an_apology/,AITA For Wanting an Apology,"
A few Monday‚Äôs ago Dad and Mum called to apologise for yelling at me because I brought up the subject of getting an assistance dog. There was no pre talk just straight to yelling and the yelling was horrific. They also didn‚Äôt like that I held them accountable not only for that but on the day I was having my endoscopy many weeks ago, they ran into someone I went to high school with, who up until the age of 25 I was friends with.



However this friend used me for her own gain in one of the worst ways a friend could ever do. She promised me a better life 3000kms away, she promised me I could have my cat, Alix, with me, she promised me time to heal (I had just left a DV relationship 2 weeks prior). 



I got there, she said ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt have your cat because I bought a dog‚Äù, she said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have time because I need a new car‚Äù‚Ä¶. A $45.000 new truck. She needed me to fulfill her selfish need of car she couldn‚Äôt afford if she was living alone and once I up and left that situation, she turned the rest of my friends against me. I now have no friends from high school.



So when my parents ran into her, they decided to have coffee with her. They knew everything that she had done to me, the day I packed up and left her home. Their reasoning for having coffee with her..



- They‚Äôre an adult, They‚Äôre allowed and no one will tell them what they can and can‚Äôt do!

- You were very mentally unstable back then, we just needed to know what really happened!

- We were just hunting for intel‚Ä¶

- Well you told a lie when you were a child, so I can‚Äôt believe you!



I‚Äôve been working closely with my psychologist, who is just as lost by their actions but she‚Äôs very supportive in helping me move forward.



If the tables were turned, I wouldn‚Äôt dare to think of having coffee with someone that has wronged either of my parents because to me it‚Äôs like a betrayal and just something you just don‚Äôt do. 

Furthermore kids lie when they‚Äôre kids for all sorts of reasons, don‚Äôt call my character as an adult into question based on something i did when i was a child. Furthermore don‚Äôt use my mental health as grounds to get to your version of what you want to have happened, do you really think that little of me? Why after all these years do YOU need intel? Yeah, adults can do what they want, but to have all these agendas about it. That‚Äôs what is hurting me the most.


I‚Äôve explained to my parents all I would like them to do is take accountability and apologise for what they did.  But now they won‚Äôt even talk to me, not a peep. They told my sister their version of events and didn‚Äôt tell her everything so when I told my sister everything they actually did and said, boy was she shocked.

We were thirteen ‚Äî old enough to know better, but still young enough to think danger was something that happened to other people. Our town was quiet, the kind where the streets wound between old oak trees and houses sat far apart, their porches wrapped in shadow. Most kids had long gone home, candy stashed away, costumes tossed aside. But we weren‚Äôt ready for the night to end. We wanted one last bit of adventure ‚Äî one more handful of candy, one more thrill before the spell of Halloween faded.

Jenny lived just down the block. We‚Äôd planned it all afternoon over the phone, whispering like conspirators.  
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs dress up simple,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be a cat. You be a witch. Meet me at the corner at eleven-thirty.‚Äù  
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said, trying to sound brave. ‚ÄúBut if it gets boring, we come right back.‚Äù

When I met her under the streetlight, the world felt different ‚Äî still and too quiet. Jenny had black whiskers drawn on her cheeks and a tail pinned to her jeans. I wore my old witch hat, slightly crooked, and carried an empty pillowcase that rustled in the breeze. The air smelled like wet leaves and the faint smoke of someone‚Äôs dying bonfire.

We started with Mrs. Harlan‚Äôs house ‚Äî she always gave out full-size chocolate bars.  
She opened the door in her nightgown, blinking at us in surprise. ‚ÄúGirls, it‚Äôs late. Most folks are in bed.‚Äù  
‚ÄúWe thought we‚Äôd try anyway,‚Äù Jenny said, smiling wide. ‚ÄúTrick or treat?‚Äù  
Mrs. Harlan chuckled and dropped candy into our bags. ‚ÄúBe careful out there,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd go straight home.‚Äù

We promised we would ‚Äî and didn‚Äôt.

Next came Mr. Peterson‚Äôs place. He answered in his robe, hair sticking up like he‚Äôd just rolled out of bed. ‚ÄúMidnight visitors? You two trying to scare me to death?‚Äù He sighed and handed us a handful of mints. ‚ÄúNow scat before I call your parents.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThanks, Mr. Peterson!‚Äù Jenny said cheerfully, tugging me away before I could apologize.

The streets grew emptier after that, the houses darker. The jack-o‚Äô-lanterns we passed had burned down to glowing stubs, their faces warped and sagging. Our laughter sounded too loud in the stillness.

Then Jenny spotted a house near the end of Elm Street ‚Äî the porch light still on, faint and flickering. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs try that one,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBet they‚Äôve got good stuff left.‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I know them.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre new, I think,‚Äù she said, already halfway up the walk.

Two cars sat in the driveway, both covered in a film of dust. I followed, heart thudding. Jenny knocked. No answer. She knocked again, harder this time.

The door opened slowly. A man stood there ‚Äî tall, messy hair, face shadowed except for his eyes, which looked too awake for the hour.  
‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù he asked, voice flat.  
‚ÄúTrick or treat,‚Äù Jenny said, forcing a grin.

He studied us for a long moment. ‚ÄúKind of late for little girls to be out alone.‚Äù  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not little,‚Äù I said, my voice smaller than I meant it to be.

He dropped a few candies into our bags without breaking eye contact. ‚ÄúThere. Now go home.‚Äù

We turned to leave, but before the door closed, I heard something ‚Äî two men arguing inside, low and tense, like a radio tuned just below hearing. The door clicked shut, locking us out ‚Äî or maybe in, somehow.

‚ÄúThat was weird,‚Äù Jenny whispered.  
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just take the park shortcut home.‚Äù

The park was at the end of the street, a wide patch of black between the trees. The gravel path cut straight through to our neighborhood. We‚Äôd played there a hundred times, but now, in the dark, everything looked different. The trees leaned closer. The air felt heavy.

We started walking, our sneakers crunching softly. Jenny hummed under her breath, trying to sound casual. Halfway through, I heard another crunch ‚Äî behind us this time.

‚ÄúJenny,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúStop.‚Äù  
She froze. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
‚ÄúListen.‚Äù

We stood still. Another step. Then another ‚Äî slower, closer.

‚ÄúProbably a cat,‚Äù Jenny said, but her voice trembled.

We walked faster. The sound followed ‚Äî steady, deliberate, matching our pace.

‚ÄúRun,‚Äù I said.

We took off, gravel spraying beneath our shoes, candy thudding against our legs. I glanced back ‚Äî two shapes, dark against darker, moving fast.

‚ÄúJenny!‚Äù I shouted as we reached the fork in the path. She veered left, I went right. It wasn‚Äôt planned ‚Äî just panic.

When I burst out of the trees at the far end of the park, I stopped and waited, gasping for breath. The street was empty. No Jenny.

‚ÄúJenny?‚Äù I called.

Silence. Then a faint sound ‚Äî a muffled cry, somewhere behind me.

I crept back, staying low, heart hammering so hard I thought it would give me away. Through the bushes, I saw them ‚Äî two men dragging Jenny toward a truck parked off the path. She kicked and fought, but one held her by the arms, the other pressed a hand over her mouth.

‚ÄúLet me go!‚Äù she screamed when he slipped.

‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù one of them growled. ‚ÄúGet in the truck.‚Äù  
The other one laughed ‚Äî a sound I‚Äôll never forget. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs feisty. It‚Äôll be fun.‚Äù

I wanted to move. To scream. To do *something*. But my body wouldn‚Äôt listen. My legs were stone. My voice was gone.

They shoved her inside, slammed the door, and drove off without headlights. The taillights vanished into the dark.

When I finally ran home, I was half out of my mind. My mom was still up reading. She took one look at me and stood. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúJenny‚Ä¶ men took her,‚Äù I gasped.

She called the police. The house filled with flashing lights and questions. I told them everything ‚Äî the man at the door, the arguing voices, the footsteps in the park. They searched all night. Found her pillowcase in the grass, candy scattered like tiny bones.

Three days later, they found her body under a bridge outside town.

They said it was quick. I don‚Äôt believe that.

The men turned out to be brothers, and one of their friends ‚Äî drifters with records, known trouble but never caught. Years later, one of them confessed. He said they saw us earlier, decided to grab one. *Just for fun.*

The others are gone now. Prison, overdose, death ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt matter.

What matters is that sometimes, when I walk home late and hear leaves crunch behind me, I still turn around expecting to see her ‚Äî Jenny with her whiskers and her tail, laughing at me for being scared.

But it‚Äôs never her.  
Just the sound of footsteps, fading into the dark.





# ""The Knock"":

I was fifteen that Halloween night in 1959, living in Los Angeles with my dad, Peter, my stepmom, Betty, and my two stepbrothers, Richard and Joseph. Dad owned a couple of beauty shops in the city, and while business was steady, things at home had been unraveling for months. You could feel it in the air‚Äîthick, tense, like something waiting to snap. Dad and Betty argued more often now, always behind closed doors, though the walls weren‚Äôt thick enough to hide the sharp edge in their voices. Still, he tried to keep things normal for us kids. That evening, he‚Äôd joked with us about our costumes‚Äîmy witch hat, Richard‚Äôs cowboy outfit, Joseph‚Äôs pirate patch‚Äîdoing his best to sound cheerful.

After dinner, he handed out candy at the door while I took the boys around the neighborhood. I‚Äôd mostly outgrown trick-or-treating, but I went for their sake. The streets smelled faintly of smoke and candy corn, porch lights glowing like jack-o‚Äô-lanterns against the cool autumn dark. Los Angeles didn‚Äôt get much in the way of seasons, but that night, the air felt crisp, almost like fall belonged there for once.

We came home around nine. The boys were flushed from running, their bags sagging with candy. They emptied everything onto the living room rug, laughing as they sorted through chocolates and taffy. Dad sat in his favorite chair, a cigarette burning between his fingers, watching them with this soft smile. ‚ÄúLook at all that loot,‚Äù he said, glancing at me as I took off my hat. ‚ÄúYou kids hit the jackpot tonight.‚Äù

Betty was in the kitchen, her back to us as she washed the dishes. She didn‚Äôt join in. Her movements were tight, mechanical, like she was somewhere else in her mind. Dad asked if she wanted to come watch TV, and she just said, ‚ÄúMaybe later,‚Äù without turning around.

By ten-thirty, the laughter faded, and the street outside went quiet. Most porch lights had been switched off, leaving only the occasional flicker of a candle in a jack-o‚Äô-lantern. The boys went upstairs to bed, still sneaking pieces of candy under their pillows. I stayed with Dad, flipping through a *Life* magazine while he talked‚Äîabout work, about school, about nothing in particular. There was a weight in his voice that night, something heavy he didn‚Äôt name. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre growing up fast, Judy,‚Äù he said, ruffling my hair. ‚ÄúSoon you‚Äôll be too old for this Halloween business.‚Äù

I smiled, but he looked tired, older than his years. Betty came in then and sat on the other side of the room, saying nothing. She kept glancing toward the clock. Eleven o‚Äôclock was creeping close, and she seemed to be waiting for it.

That‚Äôs when we heard it‚Äîa car pulling up outside. Not unusual, maybe a neighbor or someone lost, but then the engine went quiet. Dad stretched, stood, and said he‚Äôd head to bed soon. I told him I would too. And then the doorbell rang.

The sound sliced through the still house. One sharp, unexpected chime.

Dad frowned and looked toward the door. ‚ÄúWho could that be this late?‚Äù he muttered. Betty didn‚Äôt answer at first, then said, ‚ÄúProbably some kids playing a prank,‚Äù her voice flat, almost rehearsed.

Dad flipped on the porch light and walked to the door. From where I sat on the couch, I could see him open it‚Äîand see the figure standing there.

At first, I thought it was a man, maybe a tall woman. Baggy jeans, an oversized khaki jacket, gloves, a floppy hat pulled low, and thick, messy makeup smeared across the face‚Äîwhite paint, streaks of red and black, like a clown after a storm. They held out a brown paper bag. ‚ÄúTrick or treat,‚Äù they said in a high, muffled voice that didn‚Äôt sound quite real.

Dad laughed lightly. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you a little big for this?‚Äù he joked, reaching for the candy bowl on the table near the door. But the figure didn‚Äôt respond, didn‚Äôt even move‚Äîjust kept that bag extended. The silence stretched too long. Something in my stomach turned.

Dad‚Äôs hand hovered midair. ‚ÄúYou okay there?‚Äù he asked.

Then the figure pulled something from the bag‚Äîa gun, small and dark.

The sound shattered the quiet. One deafening crack.

Dad staggered back, his expression frozen in disbelief. His hand went to his chest, crimson blooming through his shirt. He fell hard onto the carpet, his cigarette scattering ash beside him.

‚ÄúDad!‚Äù I screamed, running forward. Betty was already there, dropping to her knees beside him. ‚ÄúPeter! Oh, God, Peter!‚Äù she cried, her voice breaking.

The figure at the door turned and bolted into the night. Through the window, I saw a shadowed car waiting at the curb, headlights off. The door slammed, tires squealed, and they were gone.

Dad was gasping, blood bubbling at his lips. ‚ÄúCall‚Ä¶ help,‚Äù he whispered. I froze, paralyzed by shock, until Betty shoved me toward the phone. ‚ÄúJudy, hurry! Call the operator!‚Äù

I fumbled with the receiver, my fingers slick with tears. The operator‚Äôs calm voice didn‚Äôt match the terror in our house. ‚ÄúHelp‚Äôs coming,‚Äù she said, but time had stopped.

Dad‚Äôs eyes were glassy now. He reached for me, his hand trembling. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, kiddo,‚Äù he whispered. But it wasn‚Äôt. The rug beneath him was soaked red. Betty sobbed beside him, rocking, whispering his name again and again.

The sirens came too late. Blue and red lights danced across the windows as the ambulance pulled up. Paramedics rushed in, lifted Dad onto a stretcher. One of them met Betty‚Äôs eyes and shook his head almost imperceptibly.

He didn‚Äôt make it to the hospital.

The next few days blurred together‚Äîneighbors bringing casseroles, reporters at the door, police asking endless questions. ‚ÄúDid you see the shooter‚Äôs face?‚Äù they asked me. I shook my head. ‚ÄúJust the costume. The makeup. It didn‚Äôt look‚Ä¶ human.‚Äù

Betty told them it must‚Äôve been random, a Halloween maniac. But I remembered how she‚Äôd stared at the clock. The quiet way she‚Äôd said, *Probably some kids playing a prank.*

Two weeks later, the truth came out. The police arrested a woman named Goldyne Pizer‚Äîa friend of a woman named Joan Rabel, who worked with Dad at one of his shops. Goldyne confessed. She said Joan had convinced her to do it. Joan had been close to Betty, closer than most friends. Too close, people whispered. Joan bought the gun, a .38 revolver, from a man in Pasadena. They planned the disguise together‚Äîclothes, gloves, makeup, even the bandana to hide her mouth. Joan waited in the car that night while Goldyne went to the door.

When the detective explained it to me, I remember asking *why.* He hesitated, glancing toward Betty sitting silently in the next room. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs complicated, kid,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúGrown-up things.‚Äù

But I overheard the rest later‚ÄîJoan and Betty had been in love. Joan wanted Dad gone so she could have Betty to herself. She told Goldyne lies‚Äîthat Dad was cruel, that Betty was trapped. And Goldyne, na√Øve and devoted, believed her. They chose Halloween because a stranger in costume wouldn‚Äôt raise suspicion.

At the trial, Goldyne broke down on the stand. ‚ÄúJoan said it would be quick,‚Äù she told the court. ‚ÄúJust ring the bell, say ‚Äòtrick or treat,‚Äô and do it.‚Äù Joan denied everything, but the evidence was too strong. The gun, the disguise, the witnesses.

Betty cried in the courtroom, swore she‚Äôd known nothing. The jury believed her. She walked free.

But after that, nothing in our house was ever the same. Dad‚Äôs chair stayed empty, his tools gone from the garage, his laughter replaced by silence. We moved not long after, but the echo of that gunshot followed me everywhere.

Even now, every Halloween, I can still hear that doorbell ring‚Äîsharp, bright, and final. I still see the flash of the porch light, the figure standing there with a paper bag and painted face. And I still remember how, for one terrible second, it had felt like just another harmless trick-or-treater.

You never really know who‚Äôs behind the mask‚Ä¶  
or what they‚Äôve come for.





# ""The Visitor"":

I had just sunk into the couch after a long night of handing out candy to the neighborhood kids. The house was finally still‚Äîno laughter, no footsteps, just the low hum of the refrigerator and the whisper of wind against the windowpanes. Lisa and her two kids, Emma and Jack, were asleep down the hall. They‚Äôd drifted off easily after hours of excitement, the kind only Halloween could bring.

Lisa had asked me to stay over since I lived across town, and neither of us felt like me driving back so late. We‚Äôd spent most of the evening laughing‚Äîabout the kids‚Äô costumes, the sugar rushes, the shy little ghosts who could barely say ‚Äútrick or treat.‚Äù It felt good, normal. Safe.

Emma, six years old, had been especially proud of her witch outfit. ‚ÄúAuntie Kim, look at my hat!‚Äù she‚Äôd said, spinning until the hem of her black dress fanned out like a whirlpool. Jack, her four-year-old brother, had been brandishing his toy sword, a tiny pirate captain on a candy mission. ‚ÄúArrr! I got the most candy!‚Äù he‚Äôd declared, face sticky with chocolate. Lisa had just laughed, her tired eyes soft. ‚ÄúOkay, you two, time for bed before you both turn into goblins.‚Äù

That warmth still lingered as I stretched out under a blanket, half-watching the flickering light of the last candle in the pumpkin by the window. Outside, the street was empty. Midnight had come and gone. Halloween was over. Or so I thought.

The knock came sharp and sudden‚Äîthree hard raps that cut through the silence. I froze.

For a moment, I thought I imagined it. But then came another knock, louder, more impatient. My heart gave a startled kick. Who the hell comes knocking at 12:40 in the morning? Maybe some teenagers, late stragglers hoping for one last handful of candy.

Still, something about it didn‚Äôt sit right. The sound wasn‚Äôt playful. It was heavy. Intentional.

I pulled the blanket aside and stood, the floor cold beneath my bare feet. The porch light had already been switched off, but through the peephole I could make out a tall figure‚Äîbroad shoulders, dark clothes. His face was obscured by something pale. A mask.

Then came the voice, muffled but deep:  
‚ÄúTrick or treat?‚Äù

It was almost playful‚Äîbut off. Like someone imitating a human voice, just slightly wrong.

A nervous laugh caught in my throat. ‚ÄúHold on,‚Äù I called through the door, though my voice trembled. ‚ÄúLet me get the candy.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt move. My hand hovered over the lock, and a cold dread began creeping through me. Something told me not to open that door.

Then the first bang came‚Äîso hard it rattled the frame.

I jumped back with a yelp. ‚ÄúHey! Stop!‚Äù

The second impact was louder, splintering wood, and before I could even react, the door exploded inward with a deafening crack. A man stepped through the wreckage‚Äîa towering silhouette in a black hoodie, wearing a grinning skull mask.

He was holding a gun.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move,‚Äù he said, his voice low, rough‚Äîno trace of playfulness now.

My breath hitched as he shut the door behind him with a soft, deliberate click.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I stammered. ‚ÄúTake whatever you want. My purse‚Äîwallet‚Äôs right there.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt even glance at it. The gun stayed level with my chest as his head turned slowly, scanning the room like he already knew where everything was.

And then, in that stillness, came his first words that made my blood run cold.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the bedroom?‚Äù

I felt my stomach drop. He knew there was one.

‚ÄúThere are kids,‚Äù I whispered, stepping in front of the hallway. ‚ÄúPlease, just take the money and go.‚Äù

He ignored me and moved past. His boots thudded on the tile, his pace calm, steady, like this was all rehearsed.

I wanted to scream, to throw something, but I couldn‚Äôt move. My legs wouldn‚Äôt obey. He turned down the hallway, walking straight toward Lisa‚Äôs room like he‚Äôd been there before.

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù I hissed, following him. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt go in there!‚Äù

He reached the door, pushed it open, and flicked on the light.

Lisa stirred instantly, sitting up, eyes blinking against the brightness. Emma and Jack were beside her, half-asleep and confused.

‚ÄúKim? What‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù she began, then froze when she saw the man.

Her face drained of color. ‚ÄúOh, God.‚Äù

Emma whimpered, ‚ÄúMommy?‚Äù and Jack‚Äôs pirate sword fell from his hand with a clatter.

Lisa raised her hands instinctively. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she begged. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt hurt my children. Take whatever you want, just don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

The man didn‚Äôt speak. He just aimed the gun at her.

The first shot shattered the air.

Lisa‚Äôs body jerked back against the headboard, her mouth open in shock. Emma screamed, a high, raw sound that seemed to pierce straight through me.

Jack was wailing now, clutching at his mother‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúMommy! Mommy!‚Äù

‚ÄúStop!‚Äù I cried out, but before I could move, a second shot thundered. Lisa slumped forward, her hair falling over her face. Blood spread across the sheets, bright and shocking against the white fabric.

The man stood there for a heartbeat longer, gun still raised, chest heaving under his hoodie. Then he turned his head toward me. The hollow black eyes of the skull mask locked on mine.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

But instead of raising the gun, he lowered it‚Äîslowly. Then he walked past me, brushing my shoulder as he went, the faint smell of gunpowder trailing behind him.

The front door creaked. Footsteps on the porch. The distant roar of an engine.

And then‚Äîsilence.

I rushed to the bed, grabbing Lisa‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúLisa! Lisa, please!‚Äù But it was limp, still warm but lifeless.

Emma was sobbing uncontrollably, her small body shaking in my arms. Jack‚Äôs face was buried in his blanket, whispering ‚ÄúMommy‚Äù over and over. I held them both, rocking, whispering, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôve got you. I‚Äôve got you,‚Äù though it was a lie. Nothing was okay.

My fingers fumbled with my phone, slick with tears. ‚Äú911,‚Äù I managed to tell the operator. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äîsomeone broke in. He shot her. My friend‚Äîshe‚Äôs dead. Please send help.‚Äù

The sirens came minutes later, though it felt like hours. Blue and red light flooded the windows as officers stormed in, shouting commands, clearing rooms. Paramedics followed, but one look at Lisa and they just shook their heads.

They wrapped the kids and me in blankets and led us outside. The night was cold, sharp with the smell of gunpowder and rain. Neighbors stood on their porches, silent, faces pale in the flashing lights.

A deputy took my statement. ‚ÄúHe knew where he was going,‚Äù he said quietly, almost to himself. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt hesitate once.‚Äù

I nodded numbly. He had. He‚Äôd gone straight to her.

They never found him.

Weeks passed, then months. Emma and Jack went to live with relatives. They still don‚Äôt talk much. I can‚Äôt blame them. I still hear the knock in my dreams‚Äîthe too-loud ‚Äútrick or treat,‚Äù the splintering door, the echo of gunfire.

I used to love Halloween. The laughter, the costumes, the smell of pumpkins on the porch. Now it‚Äôs just the night the world changed.

Because sometimes, evil doesn‚Äôt wear a monster mask to hide who it is. Sometimes, it wears one to show you exactly what it is.

And when it knocks‚Äî  
you never forget the sound.





# ""The Pillowcase Man"":

It was Halloween night, and my husband Harold and I had spent the evening passing out candy to the neighborhood children. Our little house sat near the end of a quiet street in a small Iowa town ‚Äî the kind where everyone knew everyone, and the air smelled faintly of wood smoke and fallen leaves. Plastic skeletons dangled from porch lights, and carved pumpkins glowed on nearly every doorstep.

Harold loved this holiday. Every year he‚Äôd pull on his faded overalls and straw hat, pretending to be a farmer ‚Äî as if anyone in town didn‚Äôt already know that he sold farm equipment for a living. He‚Äôd hand out candy with a wide grin, always tossing in an extra piece for the kids who made him laugh. I wore my usual apron, bustling back and forth to refill the bowl whenever it ran low.

The kids came in waves. Early on, it was the little ones with their parents trailing behind ‚Äî princesses clutching glow sticks, tiny cowboys tripping over their boots, superheroes shouting ‚Äútrick-or-treat!‚Äù before their masks slipped. ‚ÄúHappy Halloween!‚Äù I‚Äôd say, dropping candy into their bags. One boy, no more than six, looked up at me with enormous eyes and whispered, ‚ÄúYour house has the best candy, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

Harold chuckled and slipped him another chocolate bar.

As the night went on, the visitors grew older ‚Äî groups of teenagers laughing too loudly, shoving one another up the walkway. By ten o‚Äôclock, the laughter had faded. The street was quiet again, the porch lights beginning to blink out one by one. We settled into the living room, a half-full bowl of candy resting on the coffee table, an old black-and-white horror movie flickering on the TV.

Harold glanced at the clock. ‚ÄúThink that‚Äôs it for tonight, Alice?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably,‚Äù I said, stretching. ‚ÄúEveryone else has packed it in.‚Äù

I stepped out to the porch and switched off our light. The neighborhood looked almost peaceful ‚Äî jack-o‚Äô-lanterns flickering low, paper ghosts rustling in the wind. I closed the door and began tidying up, humming softly as Harold folded the chairs.

Then came the first sound ‚Äî a soft, hollow thump against the side of the house.

We both froze.

Harold looked toward the window. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably the wind,‚Äù I said, though my voice lacked conviction. ‚ÄúOr maybe one of those decorations came loose.‚Äù

He waited, listening. The silence stretched for several seconds before he shrugged and went back to work. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the uneasy flutter in my stomach.

A few minutes later, while I was rinsing cups in the sink, the phone rang ‚Äî shrill and sudden, making me jump. I wiped my hands and picked it up.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

Nothing. Only faint, steady breathing on the other end.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I said again, my pulse quickening.

Click. The line went dead.

‚ÄúWrong number,‚Äù I called to Harold, forcing a laugh I didn‚Äôt feel.

He came into the kitchen, concern flickering in his eyes. ‚ÄúEverything alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I lied. ‚ÄúJust a hang-up.‚Äù

We laughed it off and turned back to cleaning, but something about that call lingered ‚Äî like the feeling of being watched when you‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre alone.

By eleven-thirty, we were getting ready for bed. Harold was changing in the bedroom while I made my usual rounds, locking the front and back doors, checking the windows. The house had gone still except for the faint hiss of wind outside.

Then came the knock.

Three sharp raps on the front door.

I froze, my hand hovering over the last lock. ‚ÄúHarold,‚Äù I called, my voice small, ‚Äúsomeone‚Äôs at the door.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt this hour?‚Äù he muttered, stepping out in his pajamas. ‚ÄúMust be some late trick-or-treaters.‚Äù He smiled faintly. ‚ÄúProbably teenagers pulling a prank.‚Äù

We walked to the front door together. Harold unlocked it and opened it just a crack.

A figure stood on the porch, tall and still. He wore a dark coat, and over his head ‚Äî a pillowcase with two holes cut for eyes. Crude. Unsettling.

‚ÄúTrick-or-treat,‚Äù he said. His voice was muffled, deep, and completely humorless. He held out a small paper bag.

Harold laughed lightly. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you a bit old for this? It‚Äôs almost midnight.‚Äù

The man didn‚Äôt move. ‚ÄúGive me your money,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOr I‚Äôll shoot you.‚Äù

For a second, I thought it had to be a joke ‚Äî maybe one of our nephews pulling something stupid. ‚ÄúOh, Harold,‚Äù I said, nervous laughter catching in my throat.

Harold played along, still smiling. ‚ÄúSure, friend. I think we‚Äôve got something for you. Alice, that fake million-dollar bill in the closet ‚Äî grab that, will you?‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúHarold‚Ä¶‚Äù

But he was already walking toward the hallway closet, the masked man stepping inside the doorway behind him. Something about the way the man moved ‚Äî too fast, too deliberate ‚Äî made my skin crawl.

Harold reached for the box on the top shelf. ‚ÄúHere you go,‚Äù he said, holding up the novelty bill.

The man lunged.

They struggled, crashing into the doorframe. The box spilled open ‚Äî papers, coins, and the metallic flash of Harold‚Äôs gun.

‚ÄúHarold!‚Äù I screamed.

A deafening bang split the air.

Harold staggered, clutching his neck, crimson seeping through his fingers. His eyes widened, confused ‚Äî and then he fell.

For a heartbeat, no one moved. The man stood over him, chest heaving beneath the dark coat. Then he tore off the pillowcase. His face was pale, sharp-featured, unfamiliar ‚Äî but there was something in his eyes I‚Äôll never forget: cold desperation.

He looked at me.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move,‚Äù he rasped, the gun trembling slightly. Then, just as suddenly, he turned and ran out the door, disappearing into the night.

I dropped beside Harold, pressing my hands to his wound. ‚ÄúNo, no, no ‚Äî stay with me,‚Äù I begged. His blood was warm, slick, soaking through my apron. He tried to speak, but only a wet gurgle came out.

I dialed the police with shaking fingers. ‚ÄúMy husband‚Äôs been shot! Please ‚Äî please hurry!‚Äù

The minutes dragged like hours. The only sounds were my sobs and Harold‚Äôs ragged breaths, until those too went still.

By the time the paramedics arrived, he was gone.

They covered him gently with a sheet, their faces grim and pale under the porch light.

The investigation stretched for weeks. I told the police everything I remembered ‚Äî his height, his voice, the way he seemed to know about the gun. They found no prints, no footprints, nothing. The weapon was ours, taken from that very box.

How did he know it was there?

That question haunted me more than any other.

Only family knew about it.

Our son-in-law had asked about money not long before, muttering about bad luck and overdue bills. He‚Äôd seen Harold open that box once. But when I mentioned it to the detectives, they shook their heads. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got an alibi,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúHe was out of town that night.‚Äù

I tried to believe them. But at night, when the wind rattled the windows, I wasn‚Äôt so sure.

A month later, I was alone in that house. I‚Äôd been packing boxes to move in with my daughter. It was nearly midnight when the phone rang.

I almost didn‚Äôt answer.

When I did, there was that same breathing ‚Äî slow, deliberate.

Then a voice I hadn‚Äôt heard since that night.

‚ÄúYou should have given me the money.‚Äù

I started getting matches while out of town so I reached out to one or two that liked me initially(I accepted their likes). I just had a simple opener asking about books and movies, and like 4 mins later I get a message from coffee meets bagel that due to a report I have to reverify to access my account again.

I am only giving this stupid a try because hinge does dumb shit like this. I already got the subscription and they are acting weird. Like literally my first message and I am getting flagged; when neither girl probably saw it because it was right after I accepted their likes.

I declined to verify at first and opted to try signing back in but it keeps asking me too, I‚Äôve never heard of an app asking you to verify unless you are appealing a ban.

I sent them a message saying I will go to the BBB and I am going straight for a refund; this is so annoying. Hinge all over again

Dating apps and online dating was such an anomalous thing at first decades ago. I‚Äôd say 2012-2023 were peak years for online dating.

1o54yb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1o54yb4/i_did_not_hurt_them/,I did not hurt them,"Look, we‚Äôve all fallen into the social media trap of doom scrolling, sometimes maybe even for hours on end. We as a human species have reached a point in our timeline where every ounce of our day could be consumed by the small computer that we each conceal in our pockets. I‚Äôm no different than anyone else; I, too, have succumbed to this trap on multiple occasions, too many to even count.

But there‚Äôs something evil within these apps. I don‚Äôt know what it is or how it works. Hell, this may be a demon designated to me alone. Or an AI, who knows at this point? All I know is the other night, I was lying in bed after a long day‚Äôs work, trying to unwind and scroll some reels. Everything was normal for the first hour or so; the usual car accidents, shitposts, and memes. However, as I fell deeper into the doomscrolling, I came across a video that just showed‚Ä¶me..? Sitting at the dinner table with my brother and parents. The table was set beautifully, and my mother had prepared a nice meal of what seemed to be meatloaf, a meal she had never cooked before.

I was completely stunned. I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was seeing, and the video went on for 10 straight minutes, just showing us as we ate quietly. Once every plate was cleaned, and we all started to get up to walk away, the video restarted back to the beginning. I rushed to my parents‚Äô room to show them what I‚Äôd found, but by the time I got there, the feed had refreshed entirely.

I mean, how do you even explain that to someone, ‚Äúhey, I just saw us eating dinner on Instagram, that‚Äôs probably something to look out for,‚Äù like what? No. Luckily, though, I had remembered the username. I typed user.44603380 into the Instagram search bar, and only one account popped up. When I clicked on it, I was baffled to find that there were no posts made at all, just a blank page. However, there was one clear sign of evidence that I was looking in the right place: the profile picture. See, this account had zero followers, zero following, and everything about the page looked grey and new. Everything except for the profile picture, which was me, yet again, staring into the camera for a photo I did not take. My face was soulless and hollow. Barely maintaining the essence of a human.

This was clear evidence, though, and I ran to show my parents again. I was profoundly disappointed when both my mom and dad insisted that it had to be one of my friends playing some kind of prank on me. I don‚Äôt know why I expected either of them to understand. I mean, they‚Äôre parents, what do they know about social media? Nevertheless, I reported the account for pretending to be someone else, and by the next morning, it had been taken down. Relieved, I went to work with warmth in my chest.

When I got home, I repeated the process. Kicked my shoes off, plopped down on the bed, and began scrolling. This time, a good quarter of what I saw was me, posted from different, all-new accounts. None of the videos were actually me; they all captured me doing things that I had never once done. Walking a dog I never had, browsing at a library I‚Äôd never seen before, all taken from obscure angles like the person behind the camera was hiding.

Thoroughly creeped out, I reported every single page I came across. It totaled up to something like 30 different accounts, all dedicated to me, and I got the notification when each one had been taken down. I decided to take a break from the reels after that, putting my phone away in a drawer and going outside for some fresh air. I actually didn‚Äôt even pick up my phone again until it was time for work the next day.

When I did, a notification was displayed across the screen. I had been informed that my Instagram account had been taken down for ‚Äúpretending to be someone else.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I sent an appeal to Instagram and just went to work, albeit a little on edge. When I got off, I was astounded to find that my appeal had been rejected and that it would take 30 days before I could launch a new one.

Whatever, right, but I had a real problem going on, I couldn‚Äôt just not watch as it unfolded. I set up a basic new account and started scrolling. It didn‚Äôt take long before I found myself again. Getting coffee, stopping off for gas, interacting with people I‚Äôd never met. Eventually, that‚Äôs all that my new page consisted of: just videos of me every time I scrolled. There were now too many accounts to report all with that same random string of numbers username.

As I scrolled, the videos changed. I was no longer out doing the mundane. I was now walking down the road in every video. Walking down a road that I recognized as the one just before my actual neighborhood. Then it was in my driveway, then at my doorstep, then, as if nothing happened, back to the regular Instagram feed. Puppies, nature, advertisements. All the accounts were gone. All the videos were gone. And I felt like I was going crazy.

I tossed my phone to the side and just lay in my bed, staring up at the ceiling. I drifted off into deep thought, which eventually turned into sleep. When I awoke, I went through my normal process: getting dressed, making the bed, you know the deal. When I checked my phone, I stood utterly horrified as hundreds of videos showed up, all with thousands of views, all showing the third-person perspective of me murdering my parents.

I basically exploded out of my bedroom door to find the walls coated in blood, so much so that it appeared the walls were leaking with the crimson liquid. The smell of iron radiated throughout the entire house, and when I entered my parents‚Äô bedroom, I found them sprawled across the bed, stab wounds decorating their bare torsos. Instagram still pulled up on my device, I heard as police sirens came flooding in through the phone‚Äôs speakers.

When I raised the screen to my face, I saw myself, standing over my parents‚Äô bed, cellphone in hand. A mixture of confusion, desperation, and terror plastered across my face. That‚Äôs when the room began to flash red and blue as police lights came pouring in through the bedroom windows. A loud pounding came from the front door before it flew open and splintered as an armed SWAT unit came rushing in, rifles trained on me. They pinned me to the floor and my phone went flying from my hand, bouncing across the floor and landing propped up against the wall.

The last thing I saw on the feed was me being handcuffed before it refreshed back to the kittens and baking recipes. I was brought in for questioning, and my lawyer insisted I plead insanity. I‚Äôm writing this from a holding cell in a notebook, and I plan to have my lawyer publish it and send it out to wherever he can.

1o54xim,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1o54xim/event_three_coups/,[EVENT] Three Coups,"The United States of Brazil, as we know it today, was born out of three coups. The first coup, which many claim wasn't actually one, was the Proclamation of the Republic by Deodoro and his group of military men. They were not actively supported by the people, but they were not hated either. Ousting Pedro II and, as he was the figurehead of it, killing the Empire of Brazil were both goals that the men wanted. Followers of positivist ideology, these men believed that republicanism was the only way to take Brazil forward. 

Deodoro governed two governments‚Äîthe ""Provisional Government,"" an era marked by economic crisis, due to Rui Barbosa's na√Øve plans of industrialization, and political instability due to Brazil being *republican* but stuck with the *imperial* Constitution. The economic problems lasted until 1895, the political ones were fixed with the 1891 Constitution. The Constitution was far from perfect, even if it gave the promised religious and press freedoms, it still restricted voting to only the very few rich folk of the nation.

The Constitution also ended the Provisional Government and gave rise to Deodoro's short couple years as President. He was president, but wanted to be emperor, invoking emergency powers to close Congress for some time. After facing a crisis with the Navy, Deodoro decided to resign from the presidency, giving rise to Floriano Peixoto, the ""Iron Marshall."" Brutal and merciless, Floriano crushed every revolt against the current government, securing the precious resource that was stability. 

After the ""Republic of the Sword"" ended and elections were held for the first time in the newly-formed republic, the ""Oligarchic Republic,"" also known as the ""era of coffee-and-milk politics"" was born. Until 1930, Brazil switched between a president aligned with S√£o Paulo and a president aligned with Minas Gerais, it didn't matter *where* the president came from, it only mattered that they were aligned with these two states. Many crises occurred during this period, such as the famous Canudos War, but none were as big as the crisis of 1930. 

This takes us to the second coup, which is actually a combination of two coups, separated by seven years. These are the Vargas' coups. Get√∫lio Vargas was a candidate for the 1930 election, one where he fought against the S√£o Paulo-backed candidate J√∫lio Prestes. Prestes did manage to win the election‚Äîif legitimately or not, we are not certain‚Äîbut that didn't matter because Vargas would coup him in the so-called ""1930 Revolution.""

Vargas governed three governments. Another ""Provisional Government,"" marked by extreme political instability and the Constitutionalist Revolution, in which S√£o Paulo rose up in revolt against Vargas. The ""Constitutional Era,"" where Vargas governed under the 1934 Constitution, a more democratic piece of legislation than the last couple constitutions, but not by much. And, finally, the ""Estado Novo,"" Vargas' dictatorship created out of fear of communist infiltration.

Vargas' ""Estado Novo"" managed, under American pressure, to enter the Second World War. These soldiers would go to fight against nazism, fascism and authoritarianism, all while under the banner of a quasi-fascist dictator. This, of course, was the cause of the Estado Novo's demise. Returning soldiers started demanding that Vargas leave the Catete (the Presidential Palace), something he only did after extreme pressure from the military. This was our third coup.

Now, Brazil finds itself under the ""Democratic Constitution of 1946"" which expanded suffrage to literate men and women above eighteen years of age, and the person they chose to lead them is Enrique Gaspar Dutra. Dutra, who is known for his strong anti-communist tendencies, leads the nation into an abyss. His economic policies have been a disaster, his social policy, such as the ban on the Communist Party of Brazil, also prove extremely unpopular, his job in gutting labor rights has given Brazil over two-hundred strikes per year, and lastly, he has been seen as a man ""giving Brazil to the Americans."" 

As Dutra's term comes to a close, a movement called ""queremismo"" has been appearing all around the nation. They only want one thing; they want Vargas to return. They want Brazil to prosper like it did under the ""old man's smile,"" it's a movement born out of desperation, but it might bring him back. If this is to Dutra's liking, however, no one can say.",4,1760314032.0,ColdWarPowers,0,1.0,False

Did I turn my collection into a playlist? yes.
Actual reviews? yes.
don‚Äôt question, just vibe.

Starting off with a personal favourite,

**Tom Ford Noir EDP** : *Still Loving You - Scorpions*

dark, very very polarising ‚Äî you either vibe with it or you don‚Äôt. there‚Äôs no middle ground. personally, timeless.




**Versace Pour Homme** : *Mr. Blue Sky - Electric Light Orchestra*

smells like a bright sunny afternoon under a canopy of trees. the day feels young. carpe diem.




**Chanel Allure Homme Sport Eau Extreme** : *505 - Arctic Monkeys*

nothing to say here. pure classic ‚Äî fits any occasion, any season.




**Jean Paul Gaultier Le Beau Paradise Garden** : *Slide - Calvin Harris, Frank Ocean and Migos*

tropical energy off the charts. makes me want to throw on a floral shirt and run into the ocean with a joint between my lips.




**YSL MYSLF** : *Californication - Red Hot Chili Peppers*

this has such a beautiful scent profile. i don‚Äôt get why people hate on it just because it‚Äôs popular. it‚Äôs been my signature scent this whole year ‚Äî i‚Äôm desperately saving the last 30ml because i adore it. this is the kind of scent that‚Äôll bring every memory rushing back when i smell it again years from now. pure cinema.




**Tom Ford Black Orchid** : *Carnival of Rust - Poets of the Fall*

this smells like yearning at its darkest. like a funeral bouquet. like walking down a graveyard where love still lingers. depression in a bottle, hauntingly beautiful.




**Afnan 9pm** : *SUGAR - BROCKHAMPTON*

bubblegum bomb ‚Äî instantly takes you back to high school crushes and chewing gum under desks.




**Tom Ford Ombre Leather** : *Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2 (LPFJ2) - A$AP Rocky*

you can see a pattern here, im a tom ford fanboy. smells like underground racing, leather seats, and gasoline. you instantly feel unstoppable. think Ryan Gosling in Drive (2011).




**Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa** : *Slow Dancing in a Burning Room - John Mayer*

this smells like a hug at the crack of dawn. you feel the fingers of your lover, trace the curve of your neck and finally rest on your face; urging you to stay a little longer. but you look back at her with your poignant eyes, knowing you have to go. so you taste her lips for the last time before you grab your keys and try to leave, but at the corner of your eye you see her messy hair in the morning sun, you try not to look into her shining eyes which are overflowing by this point. you glance at the crumpled bedsheet with a coffee stain from the night before, embracing her legs and for a second you imagine yourself curled up there. but someone always has to leave. you have to leave. so you do.

1o54uha,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rants/comments/1o54uha/why_canada_is_hell_on_earth/,Why Canada is Hell on Earth,"Intro
In this essay I‚Äôm going to detail why Canada is Hell on Earth from the perspective of an immigrant who grew up there and chose to leave back to his home country.

First of all I‚Äôll just get the positives out of the way. Yes, it is an orderly and civilized place. Yes it is stable politically and there are still opportunities to achieve upward social mobility if you come from a poor country. It is also very future-proof in terms of global warming due to its cold weather and vast natural resources.

However, none of those things capture the subjective experience of actually living there on a day-to-day basis, and that‚Äôs what this essay will try to describe.

The Reality
Canada is what would happen if Portland were a country. It takes the most liberal aspects of America and dials them up to 11. While America is moving away from wokeness in Trump‚Äôs second term, Canada is doubling down instead.

There are rainbow flags at every Starbucks. The white stripes at pedestrian crossings are painted rainbow. They do land acknowledgements before every gathering at churches, concerts, and sporting events. The government is openly anti-White, opening certain jobs and grants only to non-White applicants. As an immigrant from a country with no history of slavery or oppression it is especially jarring to deal with.

Schools indoctrinate children with LGBT propaganda against parents‚Äô wills. If your child begins to identify as LGBT while at school, there are laws that prevent teachers from informing the parents that their child has started using different pronouns. If the child claims to be LGBT and the parents don‚Äôt accept that, the State can take the child away from them. It has simply become an unsafe place to raise a family.

When it comes to finding partners, the women in Canada are extremely promiscuous and it is difficult to find ones who are family-oriented. There is an extremely feminist mindset that manifests as hostility against men. Accusations of sexual harassment over minor social missteps are common, and in professional environments one feels one has to walk on eggshells to avoid getting called into HR. Toronto in particular, is the birthplace of both SlutWalk and the Pick-Up Artist movement of the early 2000s. In a sense Canada is ahead of the curve on many American social issues.

Canada has a very brainwashed and docile populace. It consists of the folks who sided with Britain in the American Revolutionary War, so they tend to skew more obedient and law-abiding. They are more likely to report you to the authorities over minor infractions and more accepting of censorship overall. If you speak out against mass migration, transgenderism, or criticize government policies you can get fired from your job and excommunicated from polite society.

Since the country is so diverse, you do not know if your neighbor has the same religion or even speaks the same language as you, making it a low-trust society with a sense of apathy and no common values.

The state of affairs in Canada is Anarcho-Tyranny: criminals get away scot-free, while law-abiding citizens get crushed by the government. When some truck drivers peacefully protested against the government‚Äôs COVID-19 response in 2022, the government shut down their bank accounts and took away their trucking licenses.

The government is currently reshaping Canadian society against the will of the people through the mass importation of millions of Indians. The newcomers refuse to integrate into society and bring their social ills to Canada. They leer and harass women, shit in public beaches, engage in scams, drive trucks recklessly, and other dysfunctional behavior. When they get a managerial role in a job they refuse to hire non-Indians, and when they rent out apartments they openly discriminate against those not from their region or caste. If a white person were to do this they would get sued but when Indians do it they are seemingly never prosecuted.

Even if they were to contribute economically to Canada, the damage they cause to the social fabric would not be worth the cost. However, even their economic contribution is dubious. The population has increased so fast that Canada is apparently undergoing a ‚Äúpopulation trap‚Äù, where GDP rises but GDP per capita and standard of living goes down. Most Indian immigrants work menial jobs as Uber and Doordash drivers. There are videos of huge line-ups of immigrants with resumes outside of coffee shops or retailers when they finally have a job opening. The ones that have finished higher education also compete with local talent for high-skilled jobs, putting downward pressure on salary.

It goes without saying that nobody voted for this, and even the Conservative politicians are controlled opposition. They talk about building more homes instead of reducing immigration.

The government‚Äôs plan is apparently to have a population of 100 million by 2100, known as the Century Initiative. The bizarre thing is that it appears the hostile elite decided to do this to replace the local populace, not even for economic reasons. Population can also be increased by stimulating the local birthrate rather than by mass-importing the Third World.

The sheer number of new immigrants bumps up the price of real estate massively. Further exacerbating the issue is the amount of illicit money flowing from China, which Canada is happy to launder. These factors have led to real estate in Canadian cities being among the most expensive in the world. The high prices make it nearly impossible for young couples to start families, and make it so a large chunk of peoples‚Äô salary is spent on rent.

The cost of living in Canada is made worse due to the prevalence of Oligopolies in every major industry. These companies collude with each other to keep prices artificially high while lobbying the government to prevent competitors from entering the market. Even essentials like groceries are not excluded from this price fixing, and this is also why Canadians pay the highest telecom prices in the world.

So far I have not even mentioned things like the weather, high taxes, or MAID (assisted suicide), but the picture is already pretty dystopian.

Who is Canada actually good for?
Immigrant women. They can meet tall, wealthy, docile men who respect women. The local men have had their will broken by feminism and by the shitty supply-and-demand of the dating market. Since Canada is a feminist country, women tend to be fat, have tattoos and piercings, have high body count, an aggressive attitude, and many other unattractive traits. This, along with the prevalence of lesbianism and transgenderism, greatly reduces the supply of eligible women. The remaining attractive women have huge egos since they realize they are in high demand, and even average looking women can date far above their level. You regularly see mismatched couples where men who are 9s date women who are 5s, whereas in some other parts of the world it is the other way around.

Wealthy overseas investors looking to protect wealth. Chinese who made fortunes through illegitimate means back home can come and launder it in British Columbia casinos and then park it in Canadian real estate. This phenomenon has become so prevalent that the term ‚Äúsnow washing‚Äù was invented to describe it.

Incumbent old money. People who bought their homes early can accrue more wealth and just live off rent from their properties and investments. However, even they are not insulated from the woke insanity that surrounds them.

People from 4th world countries. I would argue that Canada is better than 4rd world countries, but not 3rd world countries. So people from countries that lack potable water, sanitation, and basic necessities of life like Afghanistan or Rwanda may find it marginally better than back home. But if you are from even a 3rd world country it may sometimes be preferable to live back home. For folks from countries like Lebanon, Colombia, etc. one can live a decent middle class lifestyle with great weather, low cost of living, traditional culture, more freedoms, etc. There are reports of Ukrainian refugees who fled the war returning back home after only a few months of living in Canada. Dealing with Russian hypersonic missiles was preferable to dealing with the Canadian lifestyle.

Conclusion
If you insist on living in Canada, I would recommend living in a small, conservative community outside of big cities, while working a remote American job. This way you can maximize both sanity and income.

The better option would be to move out of Canada altogether. Canada still has a Tier 1 passport so it is relatively easy to move to other countries. If you are an immigrant you can gain citizenship after 3 years of residency.

You can stay in the USA or the UK for up to 6 months at a time without any visa at all, and in many European countries for up to 3 months. For longer stays in America there is a special visa called TN1 which is only available to Canadian citizens. While America is also on the decline and shares many of the same social issues, it is not quite as bad as Canada yet. If moving to a poorer country, ideally you would get a remote job or start an online business first.

As for me, I realized that this was the way they wanted to structure their society, and that they had enough souls to torment. I simply moved back home to my native country which had much better weather and where people still had their sanity.

1o54s8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1o54s8i/one_year_later_my_dav_review_dav_spoilers/,One year later - my DAV review [DAV spoilers],"As everyone was reviewing Veilguard since its release, I thought that now (nearly a year post release), I would give my own thoughts as well, especially as a lot of time passed since my last run (I did two), so I feel like I can do it without all of the fresh emotional stuff.

For those who do not want to read that much, I included final rating under every point.

\---

As we all know, Dragon age: The Veilguard is a game that was developed under borderline inhumane conditions - so I will preface this review by saying that **I do believe that the devs did the best they could**, even if I disagree with some of the things they focused on and especially post release statements.¬†

# The character writing

I will start with the characters here and say that they are all cases of ‚Äúgreat concept, lacking execution‚Äù.

I mean look at **Neve** for example. Her concept of the jaded detective whose beliefs go against the cultural norm (not believing in mage supremacy and opposing slavery) is a really good one!¬†

But her impact suffers due to Veilguard‚Äôs unfortunate dialogue structure, which doesn‚Äôt allow for us to talk to our companions whenever we want to, thus preventing us from interviewing them about their past and beliefs like we could do with Cassandra or anyone else in DAI.¬†

\---

But the worst offender in that category is **Lucanis**, who is an unfinished mess.¬†

His concepts are all great but none of these plots have been meaningfully executed and now lack lots of depth.¬†

One of the very few non-mage abominations who struck a deal with a spite demon because of their unfortunate situation of being fused together? Great.

The grandson and successor of the (abusive) First Talon of the Crows? Great. Especially as he does not want the job, thus creating an interesting tension there.¬†

Him and Illario in general? Also great as we love family drama here, as seen with Dorian‚Äôs family related quest in DAI.¬†

But the execution is where it falls flat.¬†

We cannot really address spite as an issue and we rarely see him act in a threatening way. Instead, he is played like a toddler who didn‚Äôt get his sweets, which is an unfortunate characterisation of him - and also lacks the necessary seriousness of this dark topic.¬†

His stuff with Illario is beyond unsatisfying, as many have pointed out in their reviews already.

There should have been an option to kill him - after all we are talking about the antivan Crows and not the antivan charity of peace and love.¬†

And lastly, there should have been an option for Lucanis to reject the title of First Talon as it was quite clear in Tevinter Nights that he does not want it. He even said it there to Illario.¬†

So hardened Lucanis should have learned to stand up for himself there, even against Caterina, and said no. That would have also turned the Treviso/Minrathous thing a bit more impactful imo.¬†

All in all, what I described is the case with every character in that game. The themes and concepts are all really good but the execution is lacking the necessary depth and at times also seriousness.¬†

The only exception there is **Emmrich**, who was genuinely written and executed well in his questline and also with his inner conflict that culminated in a choice that I would describe as hard enough to be Dragon age worthy.¬†

# The individual assessment

**Harding:** I am a firm supporter of the crowd of people who claim that her storyline should have belonged to Dagna, especially as the latter already had dialogue back in DAI basegame where she claimed to have felt really huge for a moment - after operating with the memory shard. So the foundation was there.¬†

Her execution feels failed as she is way too much of the awkward girl imo. I get that this is not a professional setting like DAI but the timeskip of 10 years also makes me believe that she should have been quite a lot more mature all around anyways. And especially that she shouldn‚Äôt fight over the number of books Emmrich takes with him for a camping trip.¬†

**Final rating: 2/10**

‚Äî

**Bellara:** Bellara is one of the better characters imo. She is not a ‚Äúwish Merrill‚Äù or anything like that, which I appreciate. I find her relationship with Neve to be genuinely nice to see and am also glad that it did not turn into a romance as I do like their sisterly vibe.¬†

Furthermore, I do like that she has her serious moments and not too few of them either. And those moments land well with me as they show the person behind the bubbly Veil Jumper.¬†

What I dislike though is the back and forth in her questline and the stupid resolution of her brother snapping out of it at the last possible moment. I would have preferred for Bellara to actually make a choice of killing him or not. It would have been a lot better for her character development and for showing that she actually does ‚Äúwhatever it takes‚Äù.¬†

**Final rating: 7/10**

‚Äî

**Neve Gallus:** Like I said above, her concept is great but her execution is not as the lack of investigative dialogue option with her hurts the most imo due to her national and also factional affiliations.¬†

But what I appreciate is also her moments of seriousness and the fact that she is seemingly the only character who calls out nonsense for what it is at times. Not as often as I would have liked but she does it, which helps her case (ha!) a bit.¬†

All in all, I like her archetype a lot though, especially as it is actually new when it comes to Dragon age companions as we did not have a detective before. So I am glad that she is that at least.¬†

**Final rating: 6/10**

‚Äî

**Davrin:** Davrin is one of the harder people for me to judge, really.

In general, I would say that his concept is quite interesting though I feel like there is a lot of missed potential as I believe that he would have fit into the regret theme of Veilguard a lot more if he had been at Adamant fortress, seeing Assan as a redemption now. And it would have made his willingness to help us so quickly even better as it would have stemmed from a disillusionment with the Warden leadership as he would have witnessed Clarel and the devastating results of ‚Äújust following orders‚Äù.¬†

But that aside. In his current state, I would say that he is solid but unfortunately overshadowed by Assan entirely. I feel like he could not stand on his own too well right now as his own characterisation seems to be taking a backseat for the most part, whenever Assan is involved (which is always).

His inner conflict about not dying would have been a lot more impactful if we could properly confront why he is so on edge because of his survival. Now that leads back to my Adamant idea though as one could have reasonably explained it as him seeing it as his chance at full redemption that mysteriously did not work.¬†

**Final rating: 5/10 due to him being overshadowed by Assan at all times.**¬†

‚Äî

**Emmrich:** Emmrich is great and not just by Veilguard standards.

He is a genuinely compelling character who manages to gracefully avoid the stereotypes of necromancers with his writing and also with his fear of death, which is intriguing to see with a character like him.¬†

The new lore of Lichdom that he introduces is also interesting, though I would have liked more details there. Mostly about how they work.¬†

He was not overshadowed by Manfred, which is why I think that Manfred only worked in his favour and made him more interesting, as well as his end choice - which I already called Dragon age worthy as it asks harder questions.

**Final rating: 9/10 (DAV), 7/10 (if I judge him with my general standard)**

‚Äî

**Taash:** Taash is not bad - as a concept. In execution they are though. But they did not ruin VG lol.¬†

The issue with them is not that they are non-binary, before anyone thinks that I will paint that as the issue.¬†

The issue is that they are immature, rude and even hypocritical without us having the option of calling that behaviour out.¬†

Rude characters are no issue per se. I mean my favourite is Vivienne, that should tell everyone that I can deal with such characters. But you need the ability to push back, if you so desire.¬†

I mean, they ask everyone to address them properly but then fail to do the same for Emmrich, calling him a necrophiliac instead with somewhat prettier words. That is something where the protag has to have the option to actually call that out.¬†

But aside from these limited ways of interaction, they are fine enough. At least they have actual character development on screen. After all, they do grow in both their gender and their cultural conflict (even if the resolution to the latter is dumb with that choice). So I will acknowledge that.

**Final rating: 4/10**

‚Äî

**Lucanis:** To my great shame I have to admit that I had to late edit him in here after posting already. 

Goes to show just how good he is though. His concept is great but insanely butchered, which can be traced back to Mary Kirby having been fired mid development as she does not usually write such poor characters. She wrote Loghain and Vivienne, just to name two. I think that should say it all.

As I addressed above already, his plots are handled in a very shallow way and there is not much to interact with, aside from his love for coffee. If you save Minrathous, you even miss out on the one quest that shows more depth in the spite thing (inner demons quest). 

**Final rating: 2/10** 

# The story

The story will be a quicker paragraph as I can reasonably say that it is quite flat and boring for the most part, lacking lots of depth too.¬†

They had some high there with D‚ÄôMeta‚Äôs crossing - though I won‚Äôt get over the fact that Rook yells ‚ÄúHEYYYY!‚Äù at a Dragon - and Weisshaupt, as well as the finale.¬†

But the in-between was bad and boring to me.¬†

The quests were kinda straightforward and were lacking tough choices like those that we know from DAO and DAI. I mean remember Orzammar, the Landsmeet, Mages vs Templars (DAI) or WEWH.¬†

I see none of that in DAV for the most part - and the city choice does not qualify as the aftermath wasn‚Äôt executed well. Visually it was! But in terms of actual impact I feel like it fell short. But that choice is one where I can see why people would claim otherwise.¬†

I also felt like the darker tone of previous games was lacking, especially with the Antivan Crows and Tevinter. With the latter desperately needing the upper city and a mission where we would rescue slaves and deal with the Magisterium (thinking of something like WEWH) to fully show what was carefully established in three previous games.¬†

Anyways, the ending is solid though and fun to play through. It is not my favourite Bioware ending but it is not the worst either. And I do like that Solas is finally a more active part of that too. Especially as I feel like he should have been the main antagonist all along, instead of the Evanuris.¬†

**Final rating: 5/10 generic hero story imo with the ending as a saving grace**

# The gameplay

The Gameplay is fine but I miss the ability to control my companions, especially as they are quite useless now when they are not using their skills.¬†

And talking about skills, I miss the amount of spellslots I had in DAO and DA2. DAI was already critical with 8 but DAV with only 3 is too little imo, especially as far as build variety is concerned.

But it is ultimately good and fun, so my complaints here are only minor.¬†

**Final rating: 7/10**

# Rook

Rook has to be the worst protagonist I have ever played as.¬†

With Rook we are experiencing a true lack of roleplay freedom as their personality is quite set already. The joking and sarcastic muppet who cannot be mean to anyone or even really disagree with the companions.

Additionally they also don‚Äôt offer much in terms of writing freedom thanks to their weirdly set backstories.

Instead of going all the way like in DAO then or keeping it as vague as in DAI, they chose a very weird approach of doing something half-assed.¬†

To me it still feels far more set than the Warden or the Inqui could ever be, especially as the DAO origins still offered a lot of RP freedom. I mean take the Dwarf noble. You can be a traditionalist or a reformer, you can be open-minded or an ass etc.¬†

With Rook you get told that they are from place x, did heroic thing y and then got kicked out. It is weird to me as the origin doesn‚Äôt just give me a backstory, it gives me an established behavioural pattern and personality too - heroism and idealism.¬†

**Final rating: 1/10 bc I have a good day**

# Conclusion

Dragon age: The Veilguard is an unfortunate product that, to me, falls short of what I expect from a Dragon age game. But it is not a bad game per se, especially as the foundation of something actually great is there and visible - but unfortunately not fully used as the dev cycle was what it was and many unfortunate decisions have been made by EA but also by Bioware.¬†

It is not the worst game to ever exist but also nothing I would call a genuinely great game. Still managed two playthroughs though and had my fun while playing. But more in the turning my brain off way, which is not what I am looking for with Dragon age.¬†

We came across a friendly hiker who compliment that he enjoyed my friends styles (they're both goth/punk). It was very sweet.

Later the three of us were chilling by the lake when the friendly hiker came by again. This time he approached me and asked if I had a boyfriend. It took me a moment to realize he was talking to ME. ME??? I was so stunned, as I don't often get hit on. I said no, so he proceeded to say I look cute and wants to take me out for coffee.

He offered his phone number to contact him, which I found very respectful (it gives me the choice to make contact and it avoids him getting a fake number).

Still completely flustered I suddenly forgot how to use my damn phone. As if I never used this small electronic device in my hand before and totally not addicted to. Technology? I might as well be a Victorian child seeing a smartphone for the first time. I awkwardly stammered that I couldn't find my notes to type his number down , so he asked for my number instead. I gave it to him and then we parted ways.

It's been 3 days and I haven't heard for him yet. I heard about the ""three day rule"" where a guy will purposefully wait 3 days till he makes contact, or perhaps he was just busy over the weekend. However, I am now worried that I accidently gave him the wrong number, as in I flipped two digits by accident since I was pretty flustered. If I did I feel so, so bad...what if he thought I gave him a fake number? 

I don't often get hit on, and this was the very first time a guy asked for my number. I feel like I lost my chance to go on a real date, all because I possibly flipped two digits by being the silly goose I am.

1o54ppv,https://i.redd.it/wh7rie2lrruf1.jpeg,I Tested GPT-5 Against Claude Code. The Results Changed My Workflow.,"I Spent 2 Weeks Testing GPT-5 vs Claude Code ‚Äî One Cleared My Backlog in 3 Days

Last month, I had 23 bugs sitting in my backlog. Some had been there since July.
I‚Äôm not proud of it, but that‚Äôs life as a solo developer. You fix one thing, three more pop up. You know how it goes.

Then GPT-5 dropped ( Yeah, I know am late), and everyone lost their minds. ‚ÄúGame changer!‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúThis is the one!‚Äù My Twitter feed was basically just screenshots of GPT-5 writing entire apps from scratch.

So I did what any curious (and slightly desperate) dev would do. I spent two weeks testing both GPT-5 and Claude Code on real work. Not toy examples. Not ‚Äúbuild me a to-do app.‚Äù Actual bugs, features, and refactoring that I‚Äôd been avoiding.

Here‚Äôs what happened.

- The Setup: Same Tasks, Different Approaches

I split my backlog down the middle. GPT-5 got half, Claude Code got the other half.

The tasks ranged from simple (fix a broken API endpoint) to annoying (refactor a 400-line component that grew like a weed) to genuinely tricky (debug why our payment webhooks were randomly failing).

I gave each tool the same amount of context. Same codebase access. Same me asking questions at 11 PM.

Fair fight.

- GPT-5: Fast, But You‚Äôre Still Driving

Let‚Äôs start with GPT-5 because, honestly, it‚Äôs impressive.

It‚Äôs fast. Like, scary fast. You describe what you want, and boom‚Äîcode appears. It understands context better than GPT-4 ever did. It caught edge cases I didn‚Äôt even mention.

I used it to fix a date formatting bug that had been driving me crazy. Gave it the error message and a snippet of code. Ten seconds later, it explained the timezone issue and gave me the fix.

Beautiful.

But here‚Äôs the thing: I was still driving. GPT-5 is a really smart passenger who knows the directions, but you‚Äôre the one steering. Every suggestion meant I had to copy code, paste it into my editor, test it, realize something broke, go back, adjust, test again.

It‚Äôs faster than doing it alone, for sure. But it‚Äôs still me doing it.

- Claude Code: It Just‚Ä¶ Does It

Claude Code felt different from day one.

Instead of giving me suggestions, it took action. I‚Äôd describe a bug, and it would find the file, read the code, make the changes, and run tests. All on its own.

The first time it happened, I literally said ‚Äúwait, what?‚Äù out loud.

Remember those payment webhook failures I mentioned? I spent 30 minutes explaining the issue to Claude Code. It asked a few clarifying questions, then went quiet.

Five minutes later: ‚ÄúFound it. The issue is in the retry logic‚Äîhere‚Äôs the fix. I‚Äôve updated the code and added tests.‚Äù

I checked. It was right. The bug was gone.

I didn‚Äôt write a single line of code.

- The Real Difference: Thinking vs. Doing

After two weeks, the difference was obvious.

With GPT-5, my workflow looked like this:

	‚Ä¢	Explain the problem
	‚Ä¢	Get a solution
	‚Ä¢	Implement it myself
	‚Ä¢	Debug any issues
	‚Ä¢	Repeat

With Claude Code, it was:

	‚Ä¢	Explain the problem
	‚Ä¢	Go make coffee
	‚Ä¢	Come back to finished code

GPT-5 made me faster. Claude Code made me productive.

There‚Äôs a huge difference.

- The Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie

By the end of week two:

GPT-5 helped me close 8 tickets. Not bad! I was moving faster than usual, and the quality was solid.

Claude Code closed 17 tickets. Including two I thought would take me an entire weekend.

That backlog I mentioned? The one with 23 bugs? Down to 6.

Three days. Six bugs left.

I actually had time to start on new features instead of playing whack-a-mole with old issues.

- What GPT-5 Does Better

Look, this isn‚Äôt a hit piece on GPT-5. It‚Äôs genuinely great at some things.

Explaining concepts? Incredible. I used it to understand a gnarly algorithm in our search feature. It broke it down step-by-step with examples. Chef‚Äôs kiss.

Brainstorming? Also amazing. When I wasn‚Äôt sure how to structure a new feature, GPT-5 gave me five different approaches and explained the trade-offs.

Quick snippets? Perfect. Need a regex pattern? A SQL query? A bash script? GPT-5 nails it.

But for actual work‚Äîthe kind where code needs to get written, tested, and deployed‚ÄîClaude Code was in a different league.

- The Workflow Shift

Here‚Äôs what changed for me.

I used to think ‚ÄúAI coding assistant‚Äù meant a really good autocomplete. Something that suggests the next line or helps me debug.

Claude Code isn‚Äôt that. It‚Äôs more like hiring a junior developer who works 24/7, never complains, and actually reads the documentation.

I stopped thinking in terms of ‚Äúwhat code do I need to write?‚Äù and started thinking ‚Äúwhat problems do I need solved?‚Äù

Sounds small. It‚Äôs not.

- The Catch (Because There‚Äôs Always a Catch)

Claude Code isn‚Äôt perfect.

Sometimes it needs more context than GPT-5 to get started. If your codebase is a mess (no judgment, mine was), you might need to do some cleanup first.

It also works best when you can clearly explain what you want. Vague instructions get vague results. But honestly? That‚Äôs true for human developers too.

And yes, you still need to review the code. I caught a couple of things that weren‚Äôt quite right. But reviewing code is way faster than writing it.

- What I‚Äôm Doing Now

My workflow looks completely different now.

Mornings are for Claude Code. I queue up 3-5 tasks, give it context, and let it run. I check in every hour or so to review progress.

Afternoons are for the stuff that still needs a human. Design decisions. Architecture planning. Customer calls.

GPT-5 is still in my toolkit‚ÄîI use it for explanations and brainstorming. But for actual coding? Claude Code is my go-to.

That backlog is almost gone. I‚Äôm actually working on stuff I want to build instead of stuff I have to fix.

Feels good.

- The Bottom Line

If you want a really smart assistant that makes you faster, GPT-5 is excellent.

If you want something that actually does the work while you focus on bigger problems, try Claude Code.

For me, the choice was obvious. I‚Äôm not going back.

Now if you‚Äôll excuse me, I have six bugs left to clear. Should be done by tomorrow.

What‚Äôs your experience been with AI coding tools? I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has found the same thing‚Äîor if I‚Äôm just weird. Let me know in the comments",1,1760313426.0,BuildToShip,0,1.0,False

TL;DR

I (15F) have been in an on-and-off relationship with my ex (18M) since I was 14. He‚Äôs broken up with me multiple times, each time leaving me heartbroken and struggling with my mental health. After finally healing and moving on, he recently reached out again, and we‚Äôve started talking like nothing happened. I still love him deeply, but I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll hurt me again and don‚Äôt know if I can trust that he‚Äôs changed.



Hi everyone. I (F15) have been off and on with‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him‚ÄîHayden (M18) since I was 14 and he was 17.

We originally met through a mutual friend, and I guess the attraction was always mutual, but we never really went for it. During that time, I ended up in a really abusive relationship. Long story short, I eventually got out of it, and a few months later, Hayden and I started talking again.

We hung out for the first time one-on-one in August 2024, and I remember we couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. The conversation flowed so easily‚Äîit felt so natural. Soon after that, we got together, and I don‚Äôt think I had ever been happier.

We‚Äôd go on little dates to our favorite place, Taco Bell. We‚Äôd hang out with friends, and sometimes I‚Äôd even sneak out and spend the night at his house. It felt like a classic teenage love story. It felt good. I had never experienced hands so gentle before. Maybe that‚Äôs why I fell so hard‚Äîit felt like I was finally being shown what real love was.

We‚Äôd drive around blasting music and singing along to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. But slowly, things started to change.

When things started to fall apart
My mental health began to decline. I started self-harming because of certain things going on in my life. I was scared to tell him, but I knew I had to‚Äîhe would‚Äôve seen eventually since we were sexually active.

When I told him, he was obviously upset. He said he wished I‚Äôd talked to him about it instead of doing what I did‚Äîreasonably so. He stopped answering for a few hours, and I later found out he had fallen asleep. When he woke up, he sent me a long message saying he cared about me but didn‚Äôt think he could stay in the relationship.

I asked him to call me, and we talked it out. He decided to stay. He was supposed to come see me the next day, and I thought everything was okay‚Ä¶ but instead, the next day, he broke up with me and blocked me on everything.
I was devastated. I couldn‚Äôt eat or sleep for days. His friends checked in on me for a bit, but later unadded me, saying it was affecting Hayden too. Out of respect for him, they cut contact.

The on-and-off cycle
A few months later, I was stuck in the same cycle‚Äîmissing him, asking people about him, just wanting to know if he was okay. I found out he had moved on, which hurt, but I was also genuinely happy he seemed happy.
One night in mid-November, I was with a friend who dared me to add him. We added him from her phone, and he actually responded. He asked if it was me, and I admitted it was. He later unblocked me on everything, and we started texting that night.
I cried and cried while texting him‚Äîit felt like I was going to pass out. I was so shocked he even responded. The next day, I asked him to meet me at a local coffee shop. We met up and ended up getting back together.
About three weeks later, he suddenly told me he couldn‚Äôt be with me‚Äîwhile I was at school. I was inconsolable again. He blocked me on everything, and that was that.
My breaking point

Not long after, I ended up in a mental health facility. It wasn‚Äôt entirely because of him, but maybe he played a part. I was underweight and self-harming badly.

Eventually, I was released and diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was put on medication to help manage it. I started therapy to cope with the abuse I‚Äôd endured in my previous relationship, and slowly, things started to look up.
It was still hard, but I was doing my best to move on, even though I missed Hayden deeply.

March ‚Äî again.
In March, Hayden reached out to me again. We started talking, and‚Äîsurprise‚Äîthe same cycle repeated.

He told me that without me, he felt lost. He said he loved me and couldn‚Äôt stand being without me. He also admitted he‚Äôd turned to drinking and drugs to cope.
But then he left again.

I was heartbroken all over. I couldn‚Äôt stop replaying our memories‚Äîit haunted me. Every time I saw him in town, my heart would race and I‚Äôd start shaking like I was having a panic attack.

I tried to move on. But every relationship after him wasn‚Äôt the same. I kept looking for him in everyone. I tried to recreate what we had. I had so many unanswered questions: Why couldn‚Äôt he stay if he truly loved me? Why wasn‚Äôt I enough?
Eventually, I gave up on relationships.
Healing (or trying to)

During that time, I turned to alcohol and drugs, but they didn‚Äôt fill the hole either. Eventually, I decided to get myself together.
I found a new therapist I really connected with, got on medications that worked, and I was finally happy.

I missed him‚Äîyes‚Äîbut I wasn‚Äôt letting it control me anymore. I started the school year off strong and hadn‚Äôt talked to him in seven months. I deleted all our pictures together and focused on myself.

I stopped thinking about him completely‚Ä¶ until one of my school friends brought him up one day. She showed me a picture of us, and it felt like I was going to pass out. My body reacted so strongly, I didn‚Äôt understand why. I brushed it off and tried to move on.
Now

Recently, I was going through my social media accounts and noticed a message request from him‚Äîit had been resent. My heart dropped, but I accepted it.

We added each other on Snapchat and started talking again like nothing had ever happened. He‚Äôs been calling me by the same little nicknames he used to, and we‚Äôve made plans to see each other.

But I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that this will end the same way again. I‚Äôm scared it will.
I had finally let him go, and now he‚Äôs back. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to tell him no, because honestly‚ÄîI love him more than words can describe.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm supposed to trust him or just let things play out. He knows I‚Äôve missed him, and he knows I love him. Sometimes it feels like it‚Äôs a game to him, but I can‚Äôt ignore how happy I was when we were together.
I replay our memories, and my heart hurts. I just want him to stay. But how do I know if he‚Äôs changed? How can I trust that?

I really hope someone understands and can give me advice, because I‚Äôm at a loss.",1,1760313257.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

First off, thank you to the sub members for providing some very helpful information previously.

First, the TL/DR version: It was our first flights on KLM and we had a good experience.

For those with a longer attention span:

Late in the evening of October 1st, we flew economy on AA from SAN to MIA and then business class on Air France from MIA to CDG (Paris) to CPH (Copenhagen).  This morning, we boarded KLM in HAM (Hamburg)and connected to a direct flight from AMS (Amsterdam) to SAN (San Diego).  The remarks are going to be focused on KLM, since this is a KLM sub, but I'd be glad to answer any questions about our Air France Business class experience.

The short hop from HAM to AMS was basic.  The plane was packed and they handed us a macaroon snack with coffee.

I upgraded the first flight to Economy Comfort and what made that worthwhile was the fact that I could walk right up to the Sky Priority counter in HAM with no wait.  There was a HUGE line, with grouchy-looking passengers, and with only 2 ticket agents, one who was in the empty Sky Priority desk, it was worth $20 per person just to skip that line and get early boarding.  What I could have done but didn't, was move in to one of the first 3 rows once they changed rows 2 &3 to Economy Comfort, but gave them the same perks as business class, i.e. a boxed meal.  It wasn't a huge deal, but I should have moved up for no extra cost when I could.

We had purchased FLEX tickets for both legs, so a bit more expensive, but we liked the flexibility.  On the AMS to SAN leg, I had booked economy tickets on the 787-800, and hoped for the option to buy an upgrade, that looked like it wasn't going to happen.  The flight was nearly 100% sold out, with the only remaining seats being several Economy Comfort in the middle seats only.  Ugh.

My GF and I went to dinner and the few remaining seats were disappearing one after the next.  So I refreshed over and over and over and then, 5 Premium Comfort seats opened up, so we grabbed 2 of those for $278 USD each.  

In terms of Premium Comfort, I appreciated the early boarding, the relatively roomy seats, and the private cabin.  I also found the meals to be elevated, and I've included some photos of our meals.  With many of the U.S. airlines, you will receive the same meal that they get in economy, only with ceramic plates and such.  No so on Premium Comfort, the food was actually pretty good.  No, not as good as Air France Business class, but we didn't expect that.

The crew was also lovely.  Mostly really sweet ladies with big smiles who really made the flight enjoyable.  I told the senior purser that they had a super good crew on this flight, and she said that she really appreciated it.

Any negatives?  Well, the alcohol selection was quite limited.  Not even a single rum or bourbon.  I expected something more.  Also, while the crew did a great job overall, I did notice that the restrooms were out of toilet paper during 2 out of 3 visits (3 different restrooms).

Anyway, I enjoyed the excellent service that we received on KLM, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them or fly KLM in the future.  As mentioned, let me know if you have any thoughts or questions, and once again, I appreciate the prior assistance from the sub.

I‚Äôm in my head with her read receipts being on, and her taking a long time to respond most of the time. The enthusiasm seems to be not in her messages, and anytime I‚Äôll say anything slightly flirtatious, she‚Äôll simply laugh at or heart that message, then txt back about more mundane stuff.

i will be using either the summaries the authors wrote or writing bad summaries myself with each fic with some warnings but make sure to READ THE TAGS on the actual fic.

this list may contain nsfw\*\*, underage sex and noncon/dubcon\*\* to name a few. while i have mentioned some in the summaries i will have given. i implore u to READ THE TAGS before u commit to the fic.

most of the fics will be top akechi cuz thats the dynamic i enjoy more, however there may be a couple of top akiren fics sprinkled thru.



Explicit fics



[Eros & Psyche](https://archiveofourown.org/works/65446054):It starts with a strange box on her doorstep, and only grows worse from there as Ren finds herself at the affections of a strange, ever-watching figure. Though she knows she should be wary, Ren cannot help but feel herself drawn in‚Äîno matter what common sense tells her.

(Or ""Diversity win! Your stalker is a trans ally."")



fem!akeshu, mtf ren, top akechi. **READ THE TAGS.**

i love this fic so so much. it also reminds me of a very iconic ranwan fic which makes me love it even more.



[The best part of waking up is Leblanc in your cup (and your brother in your guts)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/49544338):After the death of his half brother, Goro, Akira is convinced he'll spend Christmas Eve alone, but when said man enters through the door of Leblanc, Akira's plans quickly change between choosing his biological family and choosing the one he has at Leblanc.

incest, good old mommy kink, top akechi. gonna want to **READ THE TAGS**



[my flesh yields no pleasure](https://archiveofourown.org/works/58055068):

‚ÄúMaybe we can fuck it out of you?‚Äù

Goro‚Äôs limbs lock up. As much as Akira‚Äôs fumbled through fixing this ailment these past few hours, Goro finds himself reacting with a rushing, hormonal reaction. It‚Äôs breathtaking, to turn the prospect over in his mind, to realize that, yes, maybe, all it took was a little magic for Goro to get what he‚Äôs wanted for‚Äîhow long‚Äî?

‚ÄúSorry, just kidding,‚Äù Akira says, hand reaching up to scratch the back of his neck. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôd, uh, be weird if that was the solution, though, right?‚Äù

\~

At the beginning of a false reality, Goro is hit with an unprecedented status ailment. He proposes a...unique solution.

macro/micro porn ft. tiny goro



[Leashed, Collared, Feral](https://archiveofourown.org/works/60057076): pwp, master/pet roleplay. akechi calls and equates akira to a cat/kitten the entire fic. ftm akira, top akechi



[Overthinking It](https://archiveofourown.org/works/59769895):

>Goro is his- his boyfriend, now, going on three weeks now. This is what boyfriends do, what teenagers do. Three weeks of dating is probably the point at which this kind of stuff is introduced, right? They‚Äôre on a normal timeline. Probably.

>Akira wouldn't know.

An aquarium date gone wrong.

Or very, very right, depending on who you ask.



akechi is a possessive jealous bitch(affectionate) and decides marking akira up like a dog is very reasonable. top akechi, ftm akira.

**READ THE TAGS.** the consent is pretty much non existent and akira is coerced into it.



[Akechi, Kurusu, and a Third](https://archiveofourown.org/works/45366469):In which Mishima finds Akira's phone and decides to look through it before retuning it... shenanigans ensue.

This is a violation of privacy. He should just lock his phone again. That would be the right thing to do... but his fingers refuse to stop swiping across the screen and he eventually finds himself looking through Kurusu‚Äôs messages. Takamaki‚Ä¶ Sakamoto‚Ä¶ someone named Chihaya? Is there any chance that‚ÄîBingo. Chat logs between Kurusu and Akechi. He absolutely has to take a peek. What could the two of them possibly have in common? Why are they friends? What makes Akechi so much better than him? Mishima feels the guilt slowly sinking in with each passing moment, but even so, he has to keep going. He‚Äôd already gone this far‚Ä¶

top!akechi



[Adopting a Stray](https://archiveofourown.org/works/59217244):What a naive boy, walking home alone at night. Didn't he know that there were predators out there who'd love to have him for themselves? It seemed that Goro simply had to teach Akira a lesson.

**READ THE TAGS**!!! top akechi, ftm akira



[Ensconced](https://archiveofourown.org/works/57585373):Goro Akechi had no idea how he ended up in this situation.

One minute they were fighting a Shadow in a target‚Äôs Palace‚Äîno one special, just some corrupt manager of a popular love hotel. Then the Shadow fired a pink blast, and when he came to, Akechi found himself in a rather‚Ä¶precarious position.

That was, being tied dick first into Akira Kurusu.



[Last Stop](https://archiveofourown.org/works/63760447):Akira has a bit of a problem. A stalker obsessed with the idol Joker who sends him lurid letters describing in graphic details all the ways he wants to ruin him. Though startled by these letters, Akira rejects the kind offer of his manager, Akechi, to protect him in favor of continuing on as normal. After all, these kinds of guys are just talk, right?

Until one day, on his ride home...



non-con, top akechi,ftm akira. **READ THE TAGS**. 

this has a second part which is also chef's kiss.



[Choker](https://archiveofourown.org/works/53140321/chapters/134458066):

>Akira‚Äôs entranced by it. The charm bears the same logo as the ‚ÄòA‚Äô on her briefcase. It‚Äôs disgustingly adorable.

>‚ÄúA gift. From a fan. It‚Äôs not the kind of thing I usually wear ‚Äì not exactly proper dress for a Detective Princess,‚Äù and she must be having a brilliant time mocking her, seeing as how the words ‚ÄòDetective Princess‚Äô aren‚Äôt accompanied by their usual sneer. ‚ÄúBut what‚Äôs the harm, right? Nobody in this reality seems to care.‚Äù

>Except for one, Akira thinks. But clearly, you‚Äôve figured that out already.

Or: After Akechi returns from the dead, she starts making subtle alterations to her wardrobe. Akira notices.



fem!shuake. **READ THE TAGS** for this one and unfortunately not for sexy reasons. this is fucking sad



[Pretty 'Woman'](https://archiveofourown.org/works/55946710/chapters/142071904):Closeted celebrity detective Akechi Goro needs a date to an event being thrown in his honour, so when he meets a crossdressing hostess named Joker it seems like the best of both worlds. Let the public continue believing he‚Äôs straight by showing up with a boy who passes as a girl, what could go wrong?

\[AU where there's no personas or metaverse, the Phantom Thieves run a gay host club instead, and Akechi and Ren do a ‚ÄòPretty Woman‚Äô.\]



top!akechi



[find me a narrative](https://archiveofourown.org/works/46275052):Goro finds RPF of him and Akira. When Akira naturally denies writing it, there's nothing left to do other than finding the actual culprit (and maybe falling more in love along the way).

top!akira



[The Art of a Pretty Face](https://archiveofourown.org/works/65311789):What was supposed to be a simple afternoon hangout with her favorite shady detective quickly spirals out of control after Ren smudges her makeup and Akechi oh-so-graciously offers to fix it for her.

fem!akeshu, top akechi, mtf akira. the second part is also a banger (spoilers its t4t akeshu!!!)



[blow your brains out](https://archiveofourown.org/works/45087562):

>The loud bang that echoes in that tiny room deafens him for a second. His finger on the trigger slackens, just barely. The deed has been done, he has murdered Ren Amamiya as per orders.

>But Amamiya does not fall.

>Amamiya blinks, still very much alive, and Akechi shoots him again.

\-

Soulmates cannot seriously injure each other, much less kill. This is sure to be a problem.

top akechi



[You reap what you sow](https://archiveofourown.org/works/58701034):Akira finds himself unable to stay in his hotel room in Hawaii when his friends camp out with him.

Good thing; he knows where the student council president resides.

Bad thing; he's a hormonal teenager.

Alternative name for this fic: Akira discovers a heap of new kinks.



top akechi

\---------------------------------------------------------



[the rain still falls without you (through the seasons)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27635642):When Goro comes back to Tokyo, Akira Kurusu is long gone. He doesn't want to be found.



[A Sweet Melody](https://archiveofourown.org/works/26403703):Akira discovers a newfound appreciation for Jazz, and the side of Akechi he gets to see because of it.

AKA Rank 4 but extra gay



[Take A Chance On Me](https://archiveofourown.org/works/60750655/chapters/155146774):It's remarkably easy for Goro to worm his way into Kurusu's life. A few (several) hangouts, occasional (constant) compliments, and they're practically best friends. Then Kurusu gets the crazy idea that Goro wants to date him. Thankfully, Sae has advice to defuse the situation.



the tags for this are wonderful so just putting them here:

\[Akechi Goro is Bad at Feelings\] \[Niijima Sae is Bad at Advice\] \[Sexy Lamps\] \[5D Chess to Justify Kissing Your Boyfriend\] \[Akechi is not a reliable narrator because his emotional IQ is 0\] \[maybe the nipples had a lot to do with it\]

this fic only having 286 kudos baffles me pls read it.



[What's Love Without a Bit of Impalement?](https://archiveofourown.org/works/45005362):Akira turns back when he hears a gunshot in Okumura's Palace. That one action leads to him and Black Mask trapped in the graveyard remains together.



[why don't you ask?](https://archiveofourown.org/works/66105142):Ren lurks on Akechi Goro fan forums and tries to write a birthday letter.



[Say You'll Always Be True](https://archiveofourown.org/works/70447041):Akechi slips Akira some liquid honesty. He learns more than he bargained for.

this is crack



[we will flower again](https://archiveofourown.org/works/26984200#main):The day before Goro Akechi dies, Akira Kurusu tells him he loves him.



[Aftertaste:](https://archiveofourown.org/works/37883503)Some goodbyes are quick, wrenching like a gunshot or ripping off a bandage. Others are slow and quiet, like forgotten midnight talks, or the dying embers of a dream being snuffed out by the dawn. Akira and Akechi have the misfortune of sharing both.

Maruki's reality doesn't vanish instantly, and Akira isn't sure if that's better or worse.



[Transmigrating Into My Favorite Fictional Character's Rival](https://archiveofourown.org/works/45507850):Akira transmigrated into his favorite novel, where he is his favorite character's rival.



[we have not touched the stars](https://archiveofourown.org/works/28697313):

>‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd rather die up there than return, but it‚Äôd look bad on our record.‚Äù

>‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you just reassign him?‚Äù

>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been doing solo missions for most of his career, that kind of thing‚Äôs bound to fuck you up. And he‚Äôs the best of the best. We‚Äôll need him.‚Äù

idk if i could sum up the plot cuz its such a beautiful fic that i literally could not do it justice (pls read it)

\- **suicide attempt**

[drive me into the black hole](https://archiveofourown.org/works/24779059): a brief very self destructive akechi's pov of sae's palace.

**READ THE TAGS**. graphic self-harm, implied incest, eating disorders, suicidal ideation. just pure akechi wump



[This Love (is being turned into the plot of a featherman doujin)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/32942728):

>‚ÄúDoes Niijima-san know?‚Äù Akechi says finally, and Akira hesitates.

>‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù he trails, ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

>Akechi muffles a scream into his palms.

In which Akira attempts to confess to his crush and it goes awry in every conceivable way.



[Bubble](https://archiveofourown.org/works/49824523):

>Ren's not sure how long it's been. Days, weeks, months, years.

>All of the other Phantom Thieves have long since moved on with their lives. They don't need him anymore.

>No one does. But thanks to Maruki's gift of never being able to die, he must live and suffer.

>At least until Goro shows up.

Or; When Ren's depression gets the best of him, Goro comes to take care of him.



graphic self harm. **READ THE TAGS**



[Blood in the Water](https://archiveofourown.org/works/54926617):It‚Äôs killing him, probably. Sure, it might not be Maruki anymore. But something. Something is bringing him back to life every day, and this is his price for it keeping him on the earthen plane. A slow, slow death, from an overdose of adrenaline and water in his lungs.



Akechi Goro lives. And dies, and dies, and dies again.



[but i digress, at least i‚Äôve tried my very best, i guess!](https://archiveofourown.org/works/64519456/chapters/165691552):

>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my favorite mask Joker,‚Äù Goro says. ‚ÄúNo one compares to you. Not your stupid fucking thieves, or my stupid fucking father, or anyone. You‚Äôre my favorite person.‚Äù

>For a moment, Ren just holds his stare. Stupidly, Goro feels embarrassed, and then embarrassed for feeling embarrassed, and angry he‚Äôs doing this at all, playing this stupid fucking game that Ren probably, probably already knows all about. But maybe this time Ren will finally fucking‚Äî ‚ÄúHm,‚Äù they say, which could mean anything, but then they smile, small and sincere. ‚ÄúI like you a lot too, Akechi.‚Äù

>Goro wants to scream.

///OR: Akechi has BPD. Akechi has an FP. Akechi wants to tell Ren his feelings. So he does. Again. And again. And - at this point, it's a matter of pride.



BPD 4 BPD. qpp shuake. check out the opening notes for a full list of cws



[theodicy](https://archiveofourown.org/works/58524775):Akira Kurusu, age 27, is busy: he works three jobs, all of which he loves, and comes home to his partner every day.

Tides are changing. Dreams are converging. The world is burning down, and Akira Kurusu is trying to look away.



[memento mori](https://archiveofourown.org/works/46064656):

>Sojiro resisted the instinctive urge to start brewing a cup of coffee for him, shaking his head to clear it of the myriad thoughts seeking to creep in, ‚Äúso what is this, then? You‚Äôre looking for penance?‚Äù

>‚ÄúI am not interested in such mundane notions.‚Äù Akechi scoffed, folding his hands before him on the counter neatly. ‚ÄúConsider this testimony to be my insurance. My last will and testament, so to speak.‚Äù

\--

In considering the prospect that he might die before his revenge was complete, Akechi decides to implement a back-up plan.



[an unconventional proposal](https://archiveofourown.org/works/48704986):

>‚ÄúFirst, you insist we take a week-long trip to Okinawa to celebrate. Then, you make a reservation on the night of my birthday at a rooftop restaurant with a stunning view of the ocean. Now, you subject me to the off-key singing of a bunch of underpaid part-time workers, all for a free dessert to be shared alongside two glasses of champagne. What happens next would be clear even to Sakamoto-kun.‚Äù

>

>‚ÄúI already said I‚Äôm not proposing to you, Goro. Do it yourself or we can celebrate your fiftieth birthday as boyfriends too.‚Äù

>

>‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre not married by the time I‚Äôm fifty you will be fucking LUCKY to still be my boyfriend.‚Äù

or: am I the asshole for refusing to propose to my boyfriend?



[New Game + ?](https://archiveofourown.org/works/48832633):

It‚Äôs April.

The first thing he does, of course, is track down Kurusu.



A new game plus with a twist.



I LOVE THIS FIC SO MUCH.



[just this once](https://archiveofourown.org/works/62733595):

>‚ÄúSeriously, what do you want?‚Äù

>Another endless silence. A little gentler this time, maybe.

>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything,‚Äù says Akechi, but then he‚Äôs always been a liar.

>Akira is too. They play chess.

a moment of selfishness, in the face of a selfless world.

I‚Äôm into exploring random neighborhoods, trying new cafes and cheap eats, walking around parks or flea markets, and just chatting about life, culture, or travel. I also enjoy chill evenings with good company rather than loud parties. I am also open to travel in or out of Tokyo if the schedule permits it.

I speak 4 languages fluently: Arabic, French, English, Spanish and I am currently tackling Japanese so I think I have a good range of people I can interact with haha.

If so:

Get the names of the officers or agents involved, as well as a photograph or video of them, for your own records.

You can report here: details of the incident such as when it happened, how long ago you used Free Speech that you're now being harassed about, which agency came after you, and what they did to harass you, intimidate you, or otherwise violate your right to use of Free Speech.

If you would like to start a civil lawsuit against any officer or agent for violating your right to Free Speech or for harassing your or intimidating you about using Free Speech, get the names of the officers or agents you collected as well as your photograph or video of them, go the court website of the city, county, or state you live in, or the court website of the city, county, or state that the officers or agents are hailing from, find the appropriate three forms required to start a lawsuit yourself: one of the forms is for filing the lawsuit, a second form specifies which crime has been committed against you, a third form is for attaching what evidence you have. Ask an AI for more and better instructions on doing all this.

Also, make a huuuuuuuge fuss about it online, and call your local newspaper, and give any details about it. Try to get the case promoted nationally and/or to make it go viral.

If they show up at your door, you can ask if they have a warrant. If they don't- you can politely invite them in, make them some coffee, be nice- what they are supposed to do from there is ask whether you're planning on doing anything crazy, and if you're not planning on doing anything crazy, you can say no, and they should basically leave after that.

If they do, or want, more than that, or if they show up with a warrant, and you know it's just for non-illegal stuff you've said online- it's likely that your Free Speech rights have already been violated in this case- do what they say, but insist on getting a lawyer present. Try to get anyone who wants to fight a Free Speech case in court, maybe try the ACLU, I don't know.

I don't know too much about this stuff I'm just trying to be helpful and make a stand. If you can make a better set of instructions out of this please comment.",1,1760312301.0,democraticparty,0,1.0,False

I am visiting a friend I met online in the Netherlands atm. 
From the moment I got there she started doing things she booked and thought I'd want to see without asking me if I wanted to. 


At a venue I repeatedly said the speakers were too loud and she kept me right in front of them as she wanted to see the speakers (i have tinnitus and am.regretting not leaving a lot)


She never told me that at her place I'm staying at has other strangers in it and refused to tell me anything about them or why they were there. (A friend of her mom's? Randomly showed up and also stayed there without talking to us.) 


She never asked me what I planned or wanted to do but just kept pushing us around to do stuff


For 2 days she didn't stop at a cafe or anything to get coffee or something to eat but prompted us to run around the whole day without food. And when her boyfriend came another day she ate 2x the amount and also got snacks when he wanted to. Suddenly able to eat food???


She didn't ask how i was or if I was okay although I have multiple health conditions and at one point made me borrow a scooter and just drove off at full speed (I couldn't follow her that fast) 


She gave me a sweater she hadn't mentioned to me having, back for months as I had forgotten it in her bag and admitted to having worn it. (I asked for a sweater as I was cold)

1o5490j,https://i.redd.it/d0hydiconruf1.jpeg,Halloween movie night party for young adults in southern Brooklyn,"The Marine Park Young Adults Association is excited to host our Second Annual Halloween Movie Night Party on Friday, October 17th at 5 PM at Marine Park Coffee, located at 3411 Avenue S. This year‚Äôs celebration will feature a double horror movie event perfect for spooky season.

We‚Äôll kick off the night with Halloween II (1981), directed by John Carpenter, which is often regarded as the best sequel to the original 1978 classic. The film picks up right where Halloween left off, continuing the terrifying story of ‚Äúthe night he came home‚Äù as Michael Myers stalks Haddonfield once more. While suspenseful, Halloween II is considered less frightening than many modern horror films, making it a great entry point for those who want a Halloween scare without being overwhelmed.

Following that, we‚Äôll show Barbarian (2022), a modern horror thriller directed by Zach Cregger, who has recently earned critical acclaim for his new release Weapons. Barbarian is filled with chilling twists and a more intense atmosphere, creating a scarier and more shocking experience compared to the classic slasher style of Halloween II. To make the night flexible and welcoming for everyone, guests are encouraged to come for one or both films ‚Äî you don‚Äôt have to stay for the entire double feature.

To add to the fun, we‚Äôll be awarding a prize for Best Costume, with the winner receiving a gift from a local restaurant chosen by our Board. Attendees can also enjoy free popcorn, candy, and soft drinks throughout the evening.

The event has just a $5 cover fee at the door and is open to young adults ages 18 to 35. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of classic slashers, modern horror hits, or just looking for a fun community night out, this event promises to deliver a memorable evening of scares, laughs, and Halloween cheer.

Please reach out to Sam, the President of the Marine Park Young Adults Association, at sam@marineparkyoungadults.org for more information or if you have any questions for the event.",1,1760312110.0,sheepsheadbay,0,1.0,False

1o547wa,https://i.redd.it/kzs5nzkenruf1.png,"Quantum Leaps, WRXs, and the Elegance of Discontinuity","# Quantum Leaps, WRXs, and the Elegance of Discontinuity

*by Brent Antonson (Zhivago)*  
*Planksip | Philosophy. Science. Narrative.*

# Quantum Instantaneity

I recently captured three views of my 2011 Subaru WRX ‚Äî my dream car, now my favorite metaphor for physics.

**(A)** ‚Äî A short video: me walking around the car.  
**(B)** ‚Äî A still photo of the front.  
**(C)** ‚Äî A still photo of the rear.

The video (A) feels continuous ‚Äî a steady flow of moments, each birthing the next. It mirrors how we imagine time: a smooth river carrying cause and effect downstream.  
The photos (B) and (C), by contrast, are quantum snapshots. Two discrete realities, separated by everything unobserved.

When you leap from (B) to (C), your mind performs a quantum jump. You skip all the dandelions, side panels, and spilled coffee in between. Like an electron transitioning orbitals, you perceive the *before* and *after* ‚Äî but never the *during*.

That gap is the miracle.  
And the problem.

# Frames, Illusions, and the Machinery of Belief

Human vision stitches reality from roughly 30 frames per second. Below that, movement stutters; above that, we‚Äôre tricked into continuity. Early cinema exploited this ‚Äî *Muybridge‚Äôs galloping horse* proved that a running horse lifts all four hooves mid-air. We discovered motion by breaking it.

Reversing the frames flips cause and effect. A shattering glass becomes a perfect restoration. Einstein noticed a similar reversibility in relativity: time can run both ways inside equations. But quantum mechanics refuses to play that game. It‚Äôs discontinuous ‚Äî a mosaic pretending to be a mural.

An electron doesn‚Äôt orbit like a planet. It exists as a *probability cloud*. Observation collapses it into a point, and until that collapse, its ‚Äúwhere‚Äù is more like ‚Äúmaybe.‚Äù  
Einstein hated this. ‚ÄúI cannot believe the moon is not there when I am not looking,‚Äù he said.  
But maybe the moon ‚Äî and everything else ‚Äî *only exists when observed.*

We‚Äôve built our entire civilization on the assumption that continuity is real. But nature, it seems, prefers editing.

# Quantum Gravity and the Death of Mathematics

Physicists have spent a century trying to reconcile Einstein‚Äôs smooth spacetime with quantum mechanics‚Äô jittery discontinuity. The likely bridge is **quantum gravity**, a theory still unborn.

At its core would be the **graviton**, the hypothetical quantum particle of gravity. Detecting it would complete physics‚Äô Holy Trinity: electromagnetism, nuclear forces, and gravity unified.  
Yet the math falters at the extremes ‚Äî black holes, the Big Bang ‚Äî where equations implode into infinities. These are the places where **mathematics goes to die.**

Even the Large Hadron Collider, humanity‚Äôs grandest ring of reason, is approaching its limits. A proposed 100-km collider might not operate before 2060. By then, nature may have moved on.

# Quantum Tunneling and the Limits of Logic

Sometimes particles cheat.  
When a barrier is too high to climb, a particle *tunnels* through it ‚Äî borrowing energy from the vacuum, repaying it instantly. This is allowed because at the Planck scale ‚Äî the smallest conceivable distance or time ‚Äî energy, space, and causality blur.

The **quantum foam** churns with creation and annihilation events so rapid that ordinary arithmetic gives up.  
At that level, logic itself tunnels.

# Toward an Elegant Equation

Return to the WRX.  
Video (A) represents continuity, relativity, and the arrow of time.  
Still frames (B, C) represent discontinuity, entanglement, and quantum leaps.

Somewhere between them lies elegance ‚Äî the synthesis of flow and fracture.  
If you could write that synthesis, it might read:

>

A joke equation, sure ‚Äî but not meaningless.  
The leap from one frame to another *is* squared in experience: we remember beginnings and endings, rarely middles.  
If mathematics is the language of God, its grammar is compression ‚Äî clarity that survives translation.

# Elegance in Numbers

Pi (œÄ ‚âà 3.14159) and Phi (œï ‚âà 1.61803) are ugly decimals but perfect ideas. Together, they sketch the spiral: galaxies, hurricanes, shells, and WRX turbochargers all obey the same ratio. The Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13‚Ä¶) is nature‚Äôs metronome. Disturb it even slightly, and the beauty collapses.

In 2013, a mathematician named *Cleo* solved a complex integral with this deceptively lyrical result:

>

A formula so simple it feels accidental ‚Äî like poetry written by physics itself.  
Einstein would have smiled. He once said, *‚ÄúGod is subtle, but not malicious.‚Äù*  
Elegance is the signature of truth.

# The Elegance of Discontinuity

Maybe the universe doesn‚Äôt flow at all.  
Maybe it flickers ‚Äî a billion stills per second, rendered by consciousness like frames in a cosmic projector.

Continuity is the illusion of persistence.  
Discontinuity is the fact of being.

Every photon that strikes our retina, every heartbeat, every WRX engine firing in sync ‚Äî it‚Äôs all happening in discrete packets of existence, each quantum jumping into the next.  
The elegance is not in the smoothness, but in the gaps that still make sense.

1o544md,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dudeism/comments/1o544md/an_undudely_dude/,An UnDudely Dude,"Hey Dudes!

Much has been said about how often The Dude acts UnDudely throughout *The Big Lebowski*. Heck, even Walter points out that he‚Äôs acting ‚ÄúCalmer than you are‚Äù when The Dude confronts him for waving his piece around. 

And as others have pointed out, Dudeism isn‚Äôt really about acting like everything‚Äôs okay when it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs about how quickly we can move through the UnDudely moments in our lives and return to a state of equanimity. 

I think, though, there‚Äôs something deeper also at play. In some ways, The Dude serves as a photo negative of himself. Instructive for the ways in which he doesn‚Äôt embody his Dudeness as much as the ways in which he does.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that one of the most prominently displayed books on The Dude‚Äôs coffee table is Jean-Paul Sartre‚Äôs *Being and Nothingness*. In that tome, Sartre posits, among other things, that absence is a kind of presence. 

For example, if I‚Äôm expecting to exchange a briefcase full of money for a young trophy wife (in the parlance of our times), and the nihilistic kidnappers have yet to appear, their absence is felt nearly as strongly as if they were actually at the drop off point. 

Likewise, so many characters from The Stranger to Walter praise The Dude‚Äôs laidback attitude, his fitting right in there, that even when The Dude falls short of this ideal, the ideal is as present as if it were there. 

That‚Äôs part of what I love about this Dude Way, my Dudes ‚Äì regardless of how Dude or UnDude we might be, the feeling of Dudeness is always present and available to us. 

And like Sartre wrote elsewhere in the same book, ‚ÄúExistence precedes essence,‚Äù or as we might say, ‚ÄúTakin‚Äô it easy precedes Dudeness.‚Äù

I hope yer all abiding as well as you can,

1o53w0d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o53w0d,Manhattan Rim Job Revisited - Outsider's Take,"**TLDR**: An Out-of-Towner, with zero familiarity with the city, did his first ever NYC bike ride with help from contributors on this subreddit. Thank you r/NYCbike!

**Setup**: I made a last-minute decision to spectate the Manhattan University Cross Country Invitational held at Van Cortlandt Park this past Saturday. This was my first real time in the city. To make the trip even more complicated, I decided to stay on the NJ side and bike into the park. My only requirement was to be present at the meet between 12-3PM.  Everything else was fair game, but I did want to see as much as I could in the short time I had available.  The final route took shape based on help I got from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCbike/comments/1o1t3ml/van_cortland_to_lower_manhattan/) and my thoughts on each section are as follows:

**The Bike**: My drop-bar gravel bike with rear rack, running 1x setup. I carried a pannier bag with all the food/water for the day and extra clothes, which actually came in handy due to the scattered rains and colder temps that persisted throughout the day.

**Start:** I started in Tenafly, off of Clinton Ave. Right off the bat, I'm greeted with a slow uphill drag. I'm in decent shape, but I'm encumbered and caught off guard. The muscles quickly get up to temp and I get into a rhythm. A couple road bikers zoom past me going the opposite direction. I wave at them but no reaction.  A good omen.

**9W to Teppan Zee Bridge:** Thanks to u/Joscosticks for the tip. I was immediately impressed at the volume of pelotons that zoomed past me on the 9W. Pleasantly, there was a very wide shoulder and the motorists were very respectful. I was even able to latch onto a slower group. If the gentleman from Toronto via Seattle is reading this, thanks for letting me tag along! After [TFS Burger Works](https://www.tfsburgerworks.com/), the number of cyclist I saw died down significantly, and the shoulder on 9W became much narrower and disappeared altogether in some spots. Consequently, this section of 9W from Highland Ave to S. Broadway St was my third least favorite section of the day. Peaking through the neighborhoods, I was able to catch my first glimpse of the bridge.

**Teppan Zee Bridge**: Absolutely stunning.  What a well designed and executed multi-use bridge walkway.  Very cool landings on either side of the bridge as well. Coming from a much smaller city, I am very jealous, as I'm not used to seeing anything like that. In retrospect, I wish I had stopped at the [Coffee Ride Cafe ](https://coffeeride-cafe.com/)near the bridge onramp. It was bustling with activity on this Saturday morning. The main clientele appeared to be serious looking riders on high end race bikes and full kit, so it had to be good.

**White Plains Rd (119) to SCT:** My second least-favorite part of the day. This was essentially a 6-lane divided highway with little to no shoulder. I guess it wasn't too bad in that there was little traffic on a Saturday morning, but cars were flying by at 60mph. I noticed there are bicycle ""Share the Road"" signage, so I guess it's expected that cyclists use that route? I never ride on roads like that. If there is a better way to get to the SCT from the bridge please let me know.

**SCT:** Gorgeous trail that lived up to the recommendations. Thank you u/kehawk2 for initially bringing this trail on my radar. It was such a peaceful way to start the ride into the city, and looking back this was a great way to ease myself into the more urban riding I would face later in the day.

**Van Cortlandt to South Bronx**: I took the Mosholu Greenway to the Bronx River Greenway. I was expecting these to be not-so-nice but I actually thought they were well done and easy to navigate.  Throw in cool stops like Starlight Park and once again I was very impressed with the city's bike infrastructure. Exiting the Bronx River Greenway onto Garrison Ave, I then took the bikepath under the Bruckner Expressway. Thank you u/Chea63 for this tip! Very convenient and also I got to see a variety of interesting people hanging out underneath the expressway.

**Randall Island**: From the Bruckner Expressway bikepath I hopped over to the Randall Island Connector.  Another stunning trail.  The use of arches and foliage is really beautiful here, and Randall Island itself had this manicured and well-kept look to it. I then used the Harlem River Pathway to get to the Ward's Island Bridge, one of the coolest and narrowest urban bridges I've ever seen.

**Central Park:** From Ward's Island Bridge, I worked my way over to 97th Street and entered Central Park to do a full loop around the main circuit of East Dr/West Dr, going counterclockwise.  This seemed to be the prescribed direction for cyclists but there were definitely people happy to go against the flow of traffic. Luckily the park was closed to vehicular traffic, so I only had to share the road with runners, walkers, other cyclists, scooters, e-bikes, pedicabs, horse-drawn carriages, and the occasional patrol vehicle. Overall, this experience ended up being pretty meh. I can see how locals might enjoy getting on here (maybe at a less busy time) to get legitimate exercise in, but I found it to be a lot of dodging other people, horse shit, and random obstacles in a way I didn't enjoy (see my review of 2nd Ave).

**2nd Ave Bike Lane**: Ok, so after exiting the Park at 90th St I took 2nd Ave all the way down to Chinatown. Thanks again to u/Joscosticks for this tip.  This surprisingly ended up being one of my favorite parts of the day.  Perhaps hardened locals think nothing of it, but for an out-of-towner, riding this bike lane was pure chaos, but unlike Central Park, this was an exhilarating chaos.  For me the closest other experience I could compare it to is bombing down technical singletrack, except at any moment something could jump out at me unexpectedly.  Amidst the e-bike delivery guys, random people on Citibikes, pedestrians, and cars trying to turn into the lane, it was truly a harrowing experience.  Not to mention some parts of the bike lane were torn up quite a bit and it truly did feel like mountain biking.  Since I had roughly 90 blocks to get accustomed to how to handle this, I did eventually find my groove.  For example, I quickly learned that even when a light turns red, I still have a few seconds before the cross traffic gets a green. By the end I'm happy to say I was able to keep pace with some dudes on carbon race bikes that were darting in and out of traffic and tempting fate.

**Chinatown / ERG**: This got a little confusing, but eventually I found the entrance to the contiguous part of the ERG. By this point of the day, I was running low on daylight, so I was more focused on getting onto the HRG and wasn't able to explore and take in the sights as much as I wanted to at the Battery and in the FiDi.

**HRG:**  What a great way to conclude to my Manhattan journey.  I will say it again, urban bike infrastructure like the HRG is mind-blowing and I am honestly curious if any other American city has anything close to this. Maybe Portland and Seattle? Of course Europe and Canada probably has it great too, but for what I've personally ridden this was beyond compare.

**GWB**: As I approached the bridge, I really got reminded of how hungry I was getting, by account of the vast number of organized cookouts happening. I'm talking tent villages with full size grills and tables and lights and music. Just incredible! Would it have been inappropriate for me to strike up a conversation and see if I could pay for food? I considered it, as the food smelled great. The climb up to the bridge was steeper than I was expecting, but still manageable.  The bridge cross itself was nice, but not as nice as Teppan Zee.

**Hudson Terrace to 9W:** Once back on the Jersey side, I took Hudson Terrace back to the 9W.  And this brings me to me least favorite part of the entire ride.  Unlike the section of 9W past Clinton, the portion going through Englewood Cliffs was not great.  Similar to White Plains Rd, there was hardly any shoulder, but here there was decent traffic and I was getting buzzed by cars.  Of course by this time it was dark and although I had good lighting on my bike, it still felt nerve-wracking.  Once again, I noticed that Share the Road signage, but that did little to ease my transit and I just prayed I didn't get sideswiped.  Based on the volume of cyclists I recall going up the 9W earlier in the day, I'm surprised this section doesn't have a wider shoulder or dedicated bike lane.

**Conclusion:** And to book end an epic day for me, the hill on Clinton Ave that started the day ended up being a nice little descent back to base.  Overall, I really enjoyed this route.  I gained a huge appreciation for the NYC cycling scene and I would not hesitate to do it again... probably with a few tweaks though. I'm sure you guys will let me know.  9/10.",21,1760311116.0,NYCbike,2,0.97,False

1o53vbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1o53vbn/god_lives_below_the_earth/,God Lives Below the Earth,"When I was a little boy, my mother taught me that God lived in heaven far away. She taught me that, although distant, God was knocking on the door of my heart, and I just had to open the door to let him in. But when I was a kid, I never felt him knocking. Instead, I would look through my window at the constellations that danced their circuit through the night sky and imagine that my distant God lived among them. Then I imagined that God lived beyond them. And the older and older I got, the further and further away God became.

When I stepped onto the boat for the first time, I wasn‚Äôt particularly impressed: keel caked with barnacles and once cheery paints rendered pale imitations of their former selves by decades of exposure to the Atlantic brine. Ugly though it was, the fishing vessel Tarshish bobbed gently in the harbor thirty minutes from my hotel room in Tampa. I knew why the company had opted for a fishing vessel instead of something fast or flashy. It was cheap, sure, but more importantly, it was low profile. The last thing we needed was unwanted attention.

It certainly wasn‚Äôt the fanciest (or cleanest) transportation I had ever employed, but it wasn‚Äôt all that bad. The crew qualified among the cheerier examples of sailors that I had encountered in my career; most mariners aren‚Äôt all too pleased when a corpo diver intrudes upon their solace. Evidently, I had caught them just before payday, and the company‚Äôs fee for transporting me would be stacked on top of it. When we returned from this voyage, we would all be considerably richer. Some more than others.

The captain was an old salt dog hardened by a lifetime negotiating the brine, Russ by name. Russ was a stern and stony man until a bottle unscrewed decades of hard living on the open sea. That night, miles out from sea, he cornered me below deck in the mess galley where I was running calculations for the big dive. The sailors were getting hammered in preparation for payday but generally left me alone. Only the cook, Hunter, disturbed my focus by keeping my glass full and my plate loaded. Russ, however, did not share their respect for privacy. I endured his apparently genuine attempts at connecting with me after he occupied the seat next to mine, sipping at an old flask. I answered his probes with grunts or monosyllabic answers until he asked a question that caught me off guard.

‚ÄúCome again?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think about God?‚Äù Russ was serious. Here was a grizzled captain of fifty years‚Äô experience inquiring on the religious disposition of his contracted passenger.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt thought about God for a while.‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúI focus a lot on my work.‚Äù Russ laughed.

‚ÄúI guess that makes me lazy to think about him so much!‚Äù Russ chortled. ‚ÄúIn the open water, sometimes you have nothing but time to think.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think about God?‚Äù I set down my pen and turned the question back on him.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm quite sure about it. I‚Äôve met him!‚Äù Russ remarked, a broad grin lighting up his flushed face. ‚ÄúHappened when I was just a greenhorn; fell into the water just off Anchorage, almost froze to death then and there.‚Äù He paused.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I asked, but Russ held his pause, grasping for words to describe his experience.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember much. I was cold, too cold to swim. Muscles spasming, sinking, sinking deeper. Then warmth, a light in the dark‚Äîand a voice. He told me everything would be alright, that he was here for me. I knew I was talking to God.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid he introduce himself?‚Äù I asked, somewhat dismissively.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt need to‚ÄîI knew.‚Äù He nodded thoughtfully, as if reassuring himself. ‚ÄúI knew it was him.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt lying when I said I hadn‚Äôt thought about God for a long time. Russ‚Äô anecdote brought me back to when I was eight. I was sitting in an early morning Sunday school, learning about the fish-god of the Philistines: Dagon. Dagon was a false god; he was an empty idol that people worshiped even though he wasn‚Äôt really there. That was the day I asked my Sunday school teacher what made Dagon false and our God real. I still remember the warmth of her smile.

‚ÄúBecause God is knocking on your heart right now, he really wants you to be saved so you can spend forever with him in heaven.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can I know if I‚Äôm saved?‚Äù I remember asking. Even as a child, my question was not so much motivated by a fear of hellfire as it was a desire for‚Ä¶ something.

‚ÄúBecause God really, really loves you. Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart, you just have to let him in. Do you want to say a prayer with me?‚Äù

I never felt him knocking. I prayed that prayer half a dozen times; first when I was eight, then nine, then ten, and then at twenty‚Äìtwo, with a useless degree behind me, I decided to take matters into my own hands. If contact with God, with the reality beyond reality, was really on the table, then I would do what I must to have it. I set sail for seminary.

But now I was on a ship headed west. I leaned on the lacquered railing of the fishing vessel‚Äôs deck and observed rolling waves of brown and green, the sun high in the sky above me. I realized, rather suddenly, that I was not alone. I glanced up at the avian copilots of our mission, the seagulls which had followed us from shore. The persistent little devils were drawn to leftover fragments of fish whose odor perforated the air. They screamed constantly and scrapped over detritus, but the presence I felt was not seated in the gulls. Glancing around revealed an empty deck, the crew busying themselves below deck, or fore, or aft. The smell of fish, the cries of gulls, and vision of endless sea brought to mind the Lovecraft story Dagon.

My Sunday-school teachers had taught me that Dagon was the fish-god of the Philistines, and the Lovecraft story 2 assured me of the same. My later studies would prove otherwise. Sure, Dagon was worshiped by the Philistines of the bible, but he wasn‚Äôt a god of fish, that was a mistranslation because the Hebrew word for fish is ‚Äúdag.‚Äù When they discovered the cult of Dagon, we found that he was a grain god who had nothing to do with the ocean, worshiped first in inland Syria. No, I couldn‚Äôt expect to find Dagon in this place, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that somebody was out here with us.

By dusk we had reached our destination: just about the center of the Gulf of Mexico. The sun was beginning its habitual descent toward the horizon; the last, gentle rays painted my face orange and violet, the heat gently stung my skin. Soon, on this summer‚Äôs new-moon night, the only lights for miles around would be our humble vessel and the distant stars above who watched over all of humankind with silent disregard.

I was joined at the rail by several sailors as the sun‚Äôs light faded and a new sun became visible to us. Not in the sky, not along the horizon, but below the water. We stared down into the abyss and a yellow light in the void stared back. It diffused softly through the otherwise inky depths, transforming, by some lost alchemy, black water into crystal jade. The sailors regarded it with suspicion, murmuring among themselves about the presence which intruded on their silent night. I suppose corporate hadn‚Äôt seen fit to key them in on what exactly we‚Äôre doing out here. While the others were unsure of how to regard the unexpected phenomenon, I found the source of that feeling‚Äîthat feeling that we were not alone‚Äîfinally localized in the light itself. I was overcome with the strongest sensation that it wanted to meet me, and it beckoned me closer.

I complied. Thirty minutes later, I was in the water. The atmospheric diving suit occluded much of my peripheral vision, but I was able to orient myself by following the soft rays to the golden light. It was gentle and inviting, a long-lost friend waiting for me at the bottom of the ocean. Distracted though I was, I made certain that the umbilical which would feed me a steady diet of atmosphere was secure and that my reserve oxygen tanks were ready. After signaling a thumbs-up to the sailors above and patting the tools on my belt to ensure their security, I answered the light‚Äôs invitation and began the dive.

The waters shifted and shimmered from crystal green to aquamarine around me. The sea parted for my passage closer and closer to my luminous friend as I strove down, down, down. Blue lights seemed to blip in and out of the periphery of my vision, stars emerging to dance with their underwater sun on its circuit under the earth. The kelp, mansions of those bioluminescent krill, extended their hands to pull me deeper into their home, children eager to show off their room and toys to a new friend. Shadows of fish and sharks drifted lazily in the green, but never did they dare trespass into the cone of yellow light that illumined me as I went deeper. I saw a manta ray, ten feet wide, drift past me, unaware of or apathetic to my presence there. I saw horsefish pull their young along in a line around the stalks of lambent seaweed and fish full of eggs searching for a place to nest among them. A massive thing was floating to my left; I took my eyes off the light to see a sperm whale floating vertically, one eye watching solemnly as I entered its home. The monolithic cyclops hung inert in the water and sang a hymn to some or another diluvian idol, a blessing upon its strange new guest.

I was struck with wonder at the life in this alien place that I had trespassed upon: a garden of trees of life and two of every animal. Eclipsing them all was the light: all of the goodwill that I felt from the denizens of the deep were reflections, I knew, of the lull that pulled me deeper still. The deeper I went, the stronger that lull became. I felt my face flush and my stomach flutter‚Äîwhether from pressure or desire I do not know‚ÄîI was infatuated with the light, that new sun that I had discovered waiting for me far below the earth.

Long before Babylon was built, the Mesopotamians worshiped Enki, god of the deep. Enki lived far below the earth in a freshwater aquifer cut from the corpse of a cosmic monster. Enki was the giver of life; he sent forth the fresh water that fertilized the fertile crescent and allowed human civilization to flourish. When the mythic hero Gilgamesh sought immortality, it was in the subterranean realm of Enki that he found it. Sinking through the garden below the waves, I believed it. If the source and sustenance of life was to be found anywhere, it would surely be here.

‚ÄúJonah!‚Äù Russ‚Äô sharp voice startled me from my trance.

‚ÄúGo ahead.‚Äù I answered the captain through my radio but continued my descent.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a problem topside, you need to start making your way back up.‚Äù

‚ÄúProblem?‚Äù I paused annoyedly, watching life teem through the garden. ‚ÄúWhat problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a grease fire in the kitchen, we gotta get you back up in case we lose power.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I paused. The lull diminished slightly. ‚ÄúAlright. How bad is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúHunter‚Äôs trying to control the fire, but I‚Äôm not taking any chances. You‚Äôd better get up here.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy that, on my way.‚Äù I took one last look at the light: its warmth continued to beckon but the lull that invited me deeper was noticeably less intense now. I felt cold as I began my ascent apologetically. I wondered if it would miss me as much as I missed it.

By the time I reached the ship, the fire was out. I was beyond frustrated: the inconvenience felt as though I had been kept from the arms of a lover. My frustration was probably palpable as I hung over the rail of the ship and looked down at the distant, glowing object of my affections. It looked back, and the sailors gathered around me like the flies that attended fragments of fish and flesh in the corners of the deck.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù A feminine voice asked as we all looked down at our new sun. Jenny was the only woman on board, and she sounded genuinely curious as she took a break from slurping down a milkshake to ask her question, her lips puffed out from contact with the sweet treat.

‚ÄúPolicy dictates that I cannot disclose the identity of the asset.‚Äù I answered robotically. In truth, corporate had told me very little about the target of my recovery mission, no doubt they had kept the sailors completely in the dark.

‚ÄúI heard it singin‚Äô to me,‚Äù someone in the group said a little too loud. ‚ÄúSingin‚Äô like ma used to, it sang my favorite songs. Made me feel like I was back home again, said I was‚Ä¶ safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI dreamed a dream about it,‚Äù emboldened by the witness, another sailor spoke up. ‚ÄúIt was like a big, bright father to me. Said it was proud of me, told me to quit drinkin‚Äô so hard.‚Äù

‚ÄúI felt it too,‚Äù Jenny said, adding her paper cup to the litter of the ocean. ‚ÄúIt was‚Ä¶ I never felt anything like it. It was‚Ä¶ well, it was an experience.‚Äù

Experience. The desire to experience God had led me to that seminary which had occupied three years of my life. Once I arrived, I realized that I was the odd man out. Most of my peers were there because they had already experienced something in their life that they described as contact with God. Despite how common it was in our cohort, I had never enjoyed such an experience, and it wasn‚Äôt for lack of trying. I had tried meditation, I had tried prayer‚Äîso much prayer. As my studies advanced, I tried to replicate the practices of the Desert Fathers, the first monks, and their precursors in the Syrian wilderness; I studied the deep contemplation of Catholics in the West and the hesychast meditation of Orthodoxy in the east, all to no avail. No matter how much I knocked on God‚Äôs door, he never once answered. So, after three years of study and prayer, I laid down my books, and I think I laid God down with them.

When I laid myself down in my bunk, the creak of the rocking ship my only lullaby, I thought I would have dreamed of my rendezvous in the deep, of the lover‚Äôs lull that called to me even as my eyelids drifted shut. My rest, however, was dark and deep and dreamless. When the rising sun disturbed my rest, it was time for dive two.

This time I went deeper. Beyond that Eden, the aquamarine sea bled black. Inky darkness cut the verdant wake to ribbons that spiraled deeper, deeper, deeper. Deeper is where life ceased. The bioluminant stars did not follow me, no denizens of saltwater paradise danced around me. Detritus alone offered me company, flesh from a million dead fish mingled together in a nondescript chum. Although the webbed appendages of some unknown creature would occasionally spill over the edge of the cone of light, nothing ever emerged from the dark to claim their bloodless eucharist and commune with the gristle of the sea.

The darkness pressed against the cone of light that protected me, undulating like tentacles of an antediluvian kraken, wordlessly striving to overpower my shield and add my flesh to the chum. But then the detritus dissipated, the alien limbs no longer trespassed on the edges of the light‚Äôs gaze. Without the living or the dead to keep me company, I was alone. The darkness continued to press inward on the cone of light; the dominance of my lambent friend seemed threatened by the pressure of a trillion gallons of darkness pressing down on it. I became terribly afraid that the deep darkness would choke out the light entirely and I would be left alone in the great and terrible deep. Yet the lull of that lover far below beckoned me still into the dark, stronger than it had ever been, and the lull overcame all fear.

When Moses ascended the holy mountain, he followed a great light. The mountain was on fire, the people were afraid and refused to go any closer. But following the fire, Moses met the Lord in a cloud of glory. He passed into the cloud, and he was consumed by divine darkness. If God is light, then he needs a cloak of inscrutable darkness to shield him from our prying eyes. Otherwise, I suppose, we would all cease to be. It isn‚Äôt for man to set eyes upon the infinite, my pastors and my professors had assured me as much. So as I entered the dark cloud of glory, I interrogated the light: ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

I‚Äôm not sure I expected an answer, like Moses at the burning bush, but I got one. The light blinked. Then it sputtered. Then all my fears came true: it died.

I cannot describe the darkness in words, only that it seemed as if I was suspended in frozen blackness. My heart skipped, my insides roiled, nausea and fear and trembling seized command of inert limbs. The deep had opened its mouth wide to swallow me whole: and its jaws had just snapped shut. In the belly of that whale, I sank.

Time stopped even though I didn‚Äôt: while I was sure I was passing deeper and deeper still, I couldn‚Äôt tell how long I had been falling. A minute? An hour? Forever? Impact startled me from the spiral as my feet hit bottom. My momentum carried me down and my back thudded against the shale of whatever diluvian soil I had struck. I laid there, staring upwards, immobile. I supposed that beyond my gaze, far above the black coffin that entombed me, the sun was again setting again on the land of the living while I lay in the realm of the dead, the miscarried infant of a god I did not know. Surely this is how the Psalmist felt when he looked up from the valley of death and begged for mercy from his distant God.

But as I lay in the darkness, cruciform across a rocky shoal, I realized that even in the dark the lover was beckoning me still. The absence of the light had done nothing to deter the lull, and it beckoned me forward into darkness with greater intensity than I had felt before. My tastebuds shivered with the taste of sweetness and copper, my heart fluttered with anticipation instead of fear, my face flushed. With great effort, I sat, then I stood, then I put one foot in front of the other. The lights on my dive suit were barely enough to illuminate my immediate surroundings: white sand beneath my feet offered the palest reflection as I took step after labored step. No direction seemed better than the other, but the lover‚Äôs lull pulled me that way, and I followed.

I trespassed into the darkness and a form loomed into view at the edge of my vision, the fruit of my labored steps. A riveted metal hull, blanketed in part by extremophile algae, rose far upwards and outwards and forwards, a fellow alien in this foreign land. I placed my left hand on the hull and guided myself along its length. Painted letters drifted into sight one by one: ‚ÄúU.S.S. Cetus.‚Äù I had found my quarry. Tracing the hull on my left, I trudged forward in search of access to the wreck. My progress was interrupted when something else came into view on my right: this too was huge and metal and monolithic. Another wreck? What are the odds? But as I stepped closer to the cyclopian object I saw that it could not have been man-made.

Angular, colossal, unnatural: the leviathan object embedded in the silt and shale was cocked to one side at an 80-degree angle. Its surface was sheer, a perfect corner dividing one side from the other, but each face was pock-marked; holes burrowed into the burnished metal in hives as far as I could see. No deepsea algae dared attend the object: its surface was completely clean. By the light of my suit alone I could not tell how far it extended in any direction, but the USS Cetus had sunk directly adjacent to it.

The lover‚Äôs lull tore my attention away from the colossal thing. The object of my desire was still in the ship, this new discovery would have to wait. Walking forward, a gash in the hull of the Cetus limped into view through the silty gloom. The horizontal rip in the vessel was bent inward at the edges; vertical ribs of reinforcing metal that had once held the hull rigid protruded from the lips like hooked teeth as I set foot inside the mouth of the great dead thing.

Every inch of the ship was waterlogged, but even in its sunken state, something in the back of my mind expected to meet others roaming the halls. That same something told me that behind the closed doors I passed by, the proud crew was still occupied with their duties about the stalwart vessel. I moved as quietly and quickly as I could to avoid disturbing them; here I was, a stowaway. Hallway stretched into hallway until the lull led me to the ship‚Äôs secure holding facility.

The vault was impressive; riveted metal bars reinforced the steel panels which surrounded the circular vault door, adorned with an equally impressive vault wheel. I patted the tools on my belt as I approached: pressure-proofed powerdrill, waterproofed data key, various accouterments to get into places designed to keep you out, all useless now because the vault door hung open. Fingers of yellow light slipped weakly under the rim of the vault door: the pressure of the sea had cracked the safe for me. I pushed the door open further and the light intensified, but only slightly. I noted that the mechanized hydraulics which once locked the door into place had been shorn clean. My humble divesuit had yet to buckle under the pressure of the sea, had this mighty mechanism suffered such a catastrophic failure under these same conditions? I pushed the door further and it complied with little resistance. The room grew brighter still as its sole occupant came into view: a gold sphere the size of a cantaloupe suspended in a glass canister that terminated into a carrying handle on either side.

The light flickered tiredly; it had expended so much effort to guide me down here that, I felt, it was exhausted. The texture of its surface was imperfect: its lambent skin was hammered gold, scored by fingerprint-like ripples traced by incandescent silver. Smooth symbols in an unknown script flowed like water with the pattern of the fingerprints; instructions or blessings or warnings or curses. The glass tube had survived the pressure which had rocked even the great door, though it had been cracked. I approached the asset and grasped the carrying handles. The light faded further, panting with exhaustion, but I had the striking sense in my lizard-brain that it was relieved by my touch.

And yet the force continued to pull, the same lover‚Äôs lull, back the way I had come, back out the maw of the sunken Cetus; back toward, I already knew, the pockmarked metal thing. Whatever and whoever it might be, the lover‚Äôs lull was not seated inside the precious thing that I now held in both hands. Shivering weakly, I surrendered entirely to the lull; my limbs felt moved by an unseen current as I retraced my steps past the halls of busy drowned sailors until the inert wreck spat me out again, and I was face to face with the cockeyed object sitting in the silt.

A wound in the object: ten feet wide and thirty tall, directly across from the opening in the hull of the Cetus. How did I miss it the first time? The human vessel was forgotten, the asset in my hands faded from memory: the lover‚Äôs lull pulled me into the opening. Even though I knew my orders were to resurface with the asset intact to prepare for extraction, I disregarded those orders. This was more important.

A room stretched infinitely into darkness in every direction. The floor was made of the same pockmarked meteorite as the rest of the structure, but no walls could be seen. It was an abyss of its own in here; no bubbles in the water, no life except my own. I walked toward nothing but the lull while the asset in my hands glowed as my only sputtering light. The golden sphere fluttered in its new environment like an exhausted dog carried home from a long walk. With its own wordless voice, distinct from the lover‚Äôs lull, it whispered sweet, wordless things in my head. My mind‚Äôs eye saw visions and dreamed dreams: hurtling through a dark void, diving below deep water, impact. Death, so much death‚Äîand then life. Mammals growing up much too quickly, hominids dividing themselves from apes, dancing, dancing: dancing around fires, dancing under golden stars: love.

Then I saw the stars with my own eyes: golden stars, true gold each one, dancing in a circuit on what seemed to be a wall some hundred yards ahead of me that stretched from an unseen ceiling down to the nickel-burnished floor. The golden stars arced downward on the left side of the wall and disappeared into the floor, only to emerge on the right side in an upward swing before repeating their orbit all over again. The asset danced too in its glass shell, rolling from one side of the tube to the other, longing to join its friends in their eternal circuit. I was caught up with a feeling of sympathy for the inanimate object in my possession, and so I retrieved the crowbar from my belt with one hand and liberated the gilded sphere from its cage. Freed from its prison, the asset was pulled by some force‚Äîperhaps the lover‚Äôs lull itself‚Äîtowards the constellation.

A tear fell from my eye as it rejoined its friends; I knew, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the other spheres were overjoyed to see their sibling returned to them safely. I felt in the deepest part of my soul that the blinking lights of the spheres closest to the returned expatriate were worried mothers and concerned sisters that cooed and doted on the prodigal son as they abandoned their ordinary course to orbit a new constellation around the lost lamb. They spoke in a language I could not hear, but I longed to listen in on the excited chatter that doubtless occupied them.

A door: black and rock and just my height, just wide enough to pass through comfortably. It sat in the center of the circuit of gold stars. My attention was drawn from the sibling spheres to whatever lay behind its threshold. It had never been the missing gold star or the rest of its constellation which had beckoned me here: the lover was on the other side of this door, and not just a lover: father, mother, brother, sister,

Friend.

What had begun as a low-resolution lull, a thing that stimulated feelings of infatuation and desire, a feeling which had carried me down to this place, transformed now into something else, into an invitation. It felt as though I had done a kindness to my neighbor, and now they invited me in for coffee. Somebody, it seems, wanted to talk to me.

The door: something diffused into the water from its seams; not light, not dark, impossible to describe: color of water; perfect vision; thunder. It heaved rhythmically in and out; seizing, breathing, like a living thing. Rumble of stone grating stone; basalt skin tattooed with a hundred angular symbols. The glyphs resembled what I had seen on the golden asset, but instead of logograms lovingly inlaid in gold, these symbols were older, colder, hewn into black rock. They must have predated those on the asset; their shapes were more angular, better suited to a crude chisel than a metallurgist‚Äôs fine implements, remnants of a stone age long before man and ape parted ways. The resemblance of the glyphs on the door to those on the asset offered only one conclusion: the sinking of the U.S.S. Cetus had been no accident. The asset had drifted close to home, and the lover‚Äôs lull had coaxed the ship into the black depths.

I knew that just across this threshold was a whole other world, busily ordering itself as it had since before the dawn of life. No doubt a busy parliament of supercelestial intelligences, antediluvian sages, and paracosmic artists were hard at work sustaining the universe with colors I could not even imagine. I could poke my head in unnoticed, just for a moment, a solitary anthropoid lost in a cosmic orchestra. Maybe the celestial things wouldn‚Äôt even notice me, I could steal a glance, sate my desire, and be gone in a moment. Maybe I could even say a quick ‚Äúhello‚Äù to the lover, to the friend, and be on my way. I balled a fist and poised my hand to knock on the heaving door‚Äîand I hesitated.

Did I really want to see what was going on beyond this door? Was I really prepared to poke my head into infinity? Had I really come to the very doorstep of God‚Äîand been found wanting? No sound: absolute silence. The door breathed on its own: steady, steady; it had been doing so for all time. I mistook its breathing for my own.

My hand fell to my side. If I opened that door, that great and terrible door, I would never come back, not the same. I turned around, sanity intact, and trudged back toward the wound I had entered from, and the lover‚Äôs lull ceased. I turned and stole a glance at the dancing yellow stars. Somehow I knew that the asset, the golden dancer which I had returned home, was that star, that one to the left whose comrades still clung tightly to it, still busily fretting over its return and afraid to let it go again. The stars called out profuse and silent ‚Äúthank-yous,‚Äù and it broke my heart to move on. ‚ÄúNext time!‚Äù I promised them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay next time! I have some things I need to take care of.‚Äù The stars flickered, they asked me with the tearful innocence of children: ‚ÄúDo you promise?‚Äù

Leaving that place almost killed me; the ascent literally almost killed me; I moved too quickly and the depressurization was too much to bear. But the Tarshish picked me up, took me to port, and left the unopened door and its subterranean temple behind.

A week into my stay at Nineveh County Hospital, a couple of suits paid me a visit. The company wasn‚Äôt happy with losing its asset, which, I had reported, had been destroyed by the pressure. I was informed that my hospital bills would be my own responsibility and that I shouldn‚Äôt expect any more work from them. I get the feeling they expected me to be angry, disappointed, but I honestly didn‚Äôt see what the big deal was. There were bigger things in the world than money and health. Breathing in the sweet and fragrant air of a maritime hospital, I laid in that bed; I, a misbegotten child of a realm nobody else had ever seen, an augur of a God I had dared not look upon, and I was alive.

The nurse who checks on me laughed at a dumb joke I told, I think I‚Äôll buy her a drink when I‚Äôm out of here. The job boards I‚Äôve been browsing show openings for scuba diving instructors: that sounds like fun. The sun rose one morning and again the next; I saw it all again for the first time.

As for the lover‚Äôs lull, I feel it still, but it doesn‚Äôt invite me back into the ocean. It encourages me to talk to the homeless guy outside my grocery store, to volunteer at church, to pet the stray cats that beg for morsels of food. I never learned its name, never looked behind the door, but I knew it was God. I don‚Äôt know if God is the reality beyond reality or the still small voice that whispers in our fledgeling ears, not yet grown enough to listen. All I know is that God lives behind a door, far below the earth, and I do not need to knock any more.",3,1760311066.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I am confused however about my other cat. He is a little more apprehensive about car rides but when we are in the car his body language appears to be relaxed. He‚Äôs looking out the window and asking for pets from the baristas. He happily takes his pup cup and sits patiently in his harness as well.

the window of the drive through because he will go up and start demanding the baristas for his treat.

1o53quy,https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1o53quy/all_the_reasons_i_didnt_like_season_3_spoilers/,All the reasons I didn't like season 3 (spoilers ahead),"People keep saying that season 3 gets hate because it lacks the darker vibe of the earlier seasons but thats not it at all. I just finished it last night and the writing is comically bad. I loved the vibe/setting/mall, but they did do a bit too much nostalgia fishing and didn't execute anything well. Just off the top of my head:

I loved the max/eleven friendship plotline but it gets a bit out there when eleven dumps mike and just moves on no problem? Especially considering how long by this point she has held on to feelings for him, listening to his transmissions every night for a year, teen love which is notoriously sticky, etc etc

I really liked seeing Billy and max's relationship complicate and billy as a character become more dynamic, but man the whole cliche flashback of a pretty wind blown mom on the beach and the abusive dad being mad his son is no good at baseball it was just so so cringey and poorly executed. Cliche is actually a really good way to describe season 3. It is almost entirely tropes.  ""Marvel Movie"" is another adjective i like to use for bad/cliche/predictable writing, and season 3 was so full of moments like ""Er- the bad guys right behind me, isn't he?""

The Hawkins Post- wow! You have a spunky young aspiring journalist? Oh and is she not being taken seriously? Yeah do they make her get coffee??? Do they laugh at everything she says???? Do they dismiss every single story she suggests???????? Do they berate her for getting orders wrong?????? Another massive cliche. Don't get me started on how she suggests something that is literally front page news for any small town ever (small businesses failing to compete with the mall) and they laugh her off, even though that would literally never happen because any real paper would have been all over that before their intern would have noticed a single thing??? And then when everything goes awry with Mrs. Driscoll Nancy goes to her mom for confidence??? When by this point we have literally only known Mrs. Wheeler to be (through Nancy's eyes) a person who settled in life and never went after her dreams and (through the audiences eyes) a person who very nearly slept with a teenager despite having a whole family at home??

They went overboard with the fight scenes. Like way, way overboard. And it opens up so many plot holes. Ignoring the how cliche the terminator russian guy was, he had so many opportunities to kill hopper and just didnt. Especially given how good he can be at just up and killing people (alexei) its so unbelievable that he, a kgb operative, incredibly well trained assassin, lost in hand to hand combat to a fat american cop. I never liked fight scenes in general, always finding them a bit boring and needlessly complicated, but stranger things 3 had like 10 more than they needed to. And then of course the trope of fighting in a hall of mirrors at the 4th of july carnival, the conveniently placed stack of empty barrels for steve to knock in front of the russians in the lab. Predictable.

Erika is another example of a good idea (randomly useful previously written off little sibling who gives off incredible little sibling energy) that is just soooo poorly executed. None of her ""sassy"" lines actually hit- like, at all- and she was just so cliche and predictable and boring despite there actually being a really good character underneath, the writers just had no idea how to actually write an annoying younger sibling who is good at being annoying.

There was way too much edging (for a lack of a better word). WAY too much. I can't even tell you how many times a bad thing came incredibly close to happening but then didn't. The monster is going to get me oh no!!!!! But then Steve hits him with his car, or that slingshot (again, the slingshot?) hits a balloon and distracts it. A good thing (closing the gate) almost happened but then we delay it for a 3 second count down (they were really trying to pack as many cliches as they could into this season) and boom, the terminator shows up. These are all examples from the last episode but there are way too many to count.

The fireworks. Really? They attack the monster by throwing fireworks at it? They break into a gas station that has a huge, perfectly faced fireworks selection (despite it being the night of fourth of july when usually things are sold out) and manage to steal enough fireworks from that gas station to do real damage to that monster? The thing that doesn't even care if it's being shot at? Also have you ever shot off fireworks before? They way they burn and explode makes no sense. That scene was the most incredulous cgi nonsense I've watched in years.

The Russian lab was... well, where to start. First of all it's impractical and could have never been built the way it was, and as others have brought up it doesn't track with the way the russian military did literally anything in the 80s. Anyways despite that and the ridiculousness of a bunch of kids cracking a code that would have never been broadcast with music in the background that would have never actually been there and then managing to break in, we got the wonderful sneaking around an air vent trope that i haven't seen since i was a child watching disney channel. Don't forget the spunky girl who spat in a russian generals face and wasnt promptly executed or tortured any more than she was already going to be. also youre telling me they went through all of this without using the bathroom, eating, drinking water? Like how many days were they down there? The whole thing was just illogical and bad. And then the scene with dustin and suzy singing i just- couldn't take any part of this seriously literally at all. Plus just the direction they took Suzie as a whole. Why is she the most stereotypical ""nerd"" kid ever?

The hospital fight scene was more unnecessary fight scene slop topped with more edging and plot holes (as other have pointed out, the flayed seem to only feel collective damage when it's convenient).

And finally, the monster. This giant spider-esque gooey tentacle thing that possesses and melts people and makes the most cliche monster noises. It wasn't scary or original at all and I could come up with something better in a day.

And when steve and robin get drugged and what commences is the most stereotypical ""drug haze"" followed by the scene that was so bad it was hard to watch: ""do you like anyone?"" ""yeah"" ""who?""

I‚Äôm planning to start a small mobile coffee and matcha cart business in Canada that serves at weddings, events, and private functions. It would mainly focus on matcha, mocktails, and iced coffee ‚Äî kind of a portable, aesthetic beverage setup for special occasions.

For anyone who‚Äôs started something similar (like a mobile caf√© or refreshment cart), could you share what I‚Äôd need to get started? Specifically:

* What equipment or setup is required to run a cart like this efficiently?
* Where can I get the cart?
* What kind of permits or licenses would I need to operate 
* And roughly how much would startup costs be to get something like this off the ground?

I‚Äôm just trying to get a realistic idea of what to budget for before I start investing in equipment and branding. Any insights or breakdowns would be super appreciated!

I am doing things fine, because I have mastered that? That doesn‚Äôt mean, I am meant for that.

Remember when they claimed a few months ago that school was rough, tough and just a drudge to get through?¬† Well, today‚Äôs version of this school story is that up until NOW it was a breeze.¬† NOW it‚Äôs hard, y‚Äôall.¬† Travis pats himself on the back so hard he left a bruise.¬† He says they have been doing full time social media for 4 years‚Ä¶ wait, what?¬† I thought he was a salesman and worked for his parent‚Äôs church before‚Ä¶huh.¬† Moving on‚Ä¶ he still intends to put out a weekly vlog exploiting his children and will still enjoy his hobby of singing other people‚Äôs songs all while being away 6 days a week and spending every waking minute studying.¬† Katie looks on adoringly and says that by the time she turns 26 Travis will be a nurse‚Ä¶ and she could have a 3rd baby.¬† Dream big girl.¬† Parroting what they have seen others do on TikTok, the Clarks set up a cart for their delivery drivers full of snacks and drinks.¬† Katie repeatedly says they get SO many packages because of their ‚Äújob‚Äù and she just thought it would be a kind thing to do.¬† Except that you filmed it.¬† And shared it.¬† And bragged about it.¬† Katie lands a big new partnership with the same makeup that both Josie and Carlin are selling and once she is all made up, they head to Pigeon Forge.¬† Pigeon Forge is like the Myrtle Beach of the mountains but Katie calls it ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù.¬† Travis seems to have time for every trip and event‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs the first to hop out of the car, camera in hand, ready to film when they head to the big house to surprise Katie‚Äôs parents with a group sleepover.¬† They have to film because surprise, surprise‚Ä¶ the sleep over is really a big ad for Target AND that disposable deodorant the influencers are all hawking.¬† In an attempt to up her engagement, Katie gives away cash cards in exchange for comments.¬† Tell me again how organic and real this is?

Is. Concentrating. So. Hard. To. Get. The. Words. Just. Right.¬† It‚Äôs hilarious to hear his stilted reading.¬† The cabin is about $500 per night and pretty basic, but they are excited to be there.¬† Per usual with a Bates man, Trace makes it all about himself by finding a way to insert a clip of him skydiving.¬† He‚Äôs in a Medic Corps helicopter with both Lawson and Nathan fully dressed in Medic Corps gear‚Ä¶ playing around.¬† That‚Äôs what this ‚Äúcharity‚Äù is all about folks.¬† A bunch of immature men cosplaying hero.¬† They play putt-putt, ride go carts and a ferris wheel and eat at the famous Peddler Steakhouse.¬† For some reason, they meet up with Trace‚Äôs cheugy friend, that douche-canoe from Parrot Mountain.¬† He has a new $300,000 McLaren and takes them each on a spin individually.¬† As Lydia heads off into the night in this sports car with this leech of a man Trace hollers out ‚Äúremember‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs my prized possession‚Äù‚Ä¶. Mmmmhmmm‚Ä¶ possession.¬† Exactly.¬† They head back home so they can participate in the multi influencer event at the big house.¬† Trace and Lydia seem happy just to be included and they are thrilled to share their fuzzy little microphones with all of the kids.¬† Don‚Äôt want to miss any audio opportunities.¬† Trace ends the week squeezing in one more hobby‚Ä¶ a night game at Nyland Stadium.

Erin says she is grateful to be alive and knows that every day is a gift.¬† It‚Äôs hard to disagree with that.¬† She promotes Lawson‚Äôs vlog from Florida and says every time she watches it she just sobs.¬† To lighten the mood, she shares Everly‚Äôs crayon drawings.¬† At age 7 she‚Äôs just as good as‚Ä¶ the average 7 year old.¬† In what can only be described as a passive aggressive punch to the gut‚Ä¶ she shares an unflattering picture of a stooped over Chad, knee deep in laundry and titles it ‚Äúwhat dreams are made of‚Äù with a kissy face emoji added for good measure.¬† Homegirl that is just not true.¬† Your mid 30s unemployed grifter of a man ain‚Äôt nobody‚Äôs dream.¬† I doubt he‚Äôs even yours.¬† Erin shows the chaos that is her daily life by filming from her perch on the couch.¬† Carles is banging on the piano (a chip off the old block), while Brookie dances in a God honoring way and the littles are flying around in a cozy coupe with baby William holding on to the top for dear life.¬† While all of that goes on around her, she finishes up editing ‚ÄúPart 1‚Äù of her Birth Story and posts it to YouTube.¬† Now she just needs to sit back and watch the money start rolling in.¬† She‚Äôs using Jessa Duggar‚Äôs playbook of a multi-part series and hoping for enough money to book a Christmas Cabin with Bobby and Tori.¬† Basically she had a long, hard labor and was not progressing as quickly as she normally does.¬† Both Kelly and Tori are there along with Chad and what sticks out like a sore thumb is that Chad seems‚Ä¶ agitated.¬† Unhappy.¬† Restless.¬† It‚Äôs hard to put into words but the man has anger just below the surface.¬† Maybe he didn‚Äôt want anyone in the room with them, or maybe he thought this would be business as usual‚Ä¶ whatever the case may be‚Ä¶ he disagrees with everything Erin says and even as she keeps sweet, his words are harsh.¬† He aggressively taps the side of the bed over and over while speaking in a condescending manner and puts his hat on and off over and over again. It was a tough watch but in the end the baby is here.¬† He is very early and very tiny.¬† Erin sits on the edge of her bed and softly explains that in the vlogs to come, she will attempt to explain everything that happened afterwards.¬† I can‚Äôt help but feel that she doesn‚Äôt really want to‚Ä¶ but she knows she has 7 little mouths to feed and they can‚Äôt live on sourdough alone.

They make more goofy reels this week that allow Lawson to be on film shirtless in his tight jeans and Tiffy to remind everyone that she is pregnant.¬†I was thrilled to see comments from people saying, ‚Äúplease buy your husband a shirt!‚Äù



10.Bits and Bytes‚Ä¶ now that the Bates Sister‚Äôs Boutique is closing what will happen to the warehouse full of clothing? So far they have only offered a 20% mark down‚Ä¶ Even though they say the boutique is closing now it appears it has been closed for quite some time‚Ä¶ No new posts since the end of August and Lacey was the one last employee still hanging around‚Ä¶ Kelly has another ad that she says is not an ad this week for her famous  skants‚Ä¶.Leggings attached to a skirt. It‚Äôs an idea that Kelly can really get behind and even though she says she‚Äôs not paid to do these promotions‚Ä¶There is a banner on her video that takes you straight to the company‚Äôs website‚Ä¶ Katie brings homemade brownies to the influencer sleepover‚Ä¶ At 25 years old, she says it is the very first time she has ever made brownies. She has some catching up to do in her TradWife life.

4.Down in Borlando Alyssa Webster has a new set of pots and pans she‚Äôd like you to buy.¬† She shows them off through her heavily filtered lens and says it‚Äôs not an ad.¬† She does tag the company though‚Ä¶ so maybe the set was gifted, or maybe she‚Äôs just hopeful.¬† She escapes her suburban hell to head to Aldi where she buys every single fall flavored and themed item.¬† If you look up the word ‚Äúbasic‚Äù I swear you‚Äôll get a picture of Mrs. Webster.¬† Washed out white pumpkins, scarecrows and word art with some hard ass pumpkin flavored cookies get set out all around her house and she proudly shows it off.¬† Place looks like the specialty aisle at the local Dollar General.¬† Alyssa makes it all worse by insisting on showing the decorations through some weird Instagram filter‚Ä¶ what we don‚Äôt see is‚Ä¶ her.¬† Why is she hiding?¬† In her ongoing scream for attention she showcases her chain coffee shop drink and the message written on the cup calling her the ‚Äúfav custie of the month‚Äù.¬† Dang the bar is in hell for what excites her.¬† Her scream for attention is answered by‚Ä¶ the teen barista at the corner coffee shop where she spends her couch change daily.¬† One good thing about all of this is that it must signal she is officially out of mourning for Mr. Kirk and ready to rejoin the world, right?¬†¬† Not so fast‚Ä¶after all of that lighthearted fun she reposts an Erika Kirk post and orders her followers to ‚Äúread the caption‚Äù.¬† She says she is sobbing crying because it‚Äôs been a month since he passed.¬† Alas‚Ä¶ the mourning veil is back on.

5.This week we learned that Whitney and Zach took their 2 older kids and her pee stick pregnancy test to Ruth‚Äôs Chris Steak House for a celebratory pee stick dinner.¬† They all passed the stick around while eating beef and then had a photo shoot out front of the restaurant holding up the pee stick of wonder. What the actual hell.¬† This pee stick is more well-traveled than a Webster kid.¬† Can we put this thing away already?? Everything over at their house is pregnancy hormones, cravings and talk.¬† We‚Äôve got 9 months of this mess coming.¬† Zach even blames Whitney‚Äôs pregnancy cravings for his lack of Bates Kitchen content.¬† He says she only wants to eat fast food.¬† We‚Äôre supposed to believe that just started with this pregnancy?¬† I‚Äôd choose Wendy‚Äôs over a mayonnaise and cheese pie too‚Ä¶ and I am nowhere close to being knocked up.¬† His Youtube may be dead‚Ä¶ but the spirit lives on as he shares his chili recipe on Instagram‚Ä¶ complete with a band-aid on his finger.¬† If you can get past the grossness of him touching everything with that nasty old bandage, you learn that this whole thing is a big ad for a grocery store and a new brand of Broth.¬† Of course Jadon is there to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù (i.e. be exploited).¬† Whitney shows up to hawk some Prime Day deals and then exploits Lily while she eats her breakfast and slurps down her supplement infused milk.¬† Whitney is currently selling about 4 different powders along with supplements, gummies and liquid vitamins.¬† She‚Äôs a walking GNC until the camera turns off and then she‚Äôs first in line at Mickey D‚Äôs.¬† Zach pulls up in the Denali to meet the other exploiters for their group filming event.¬† He has that car tent tied to the top of the car.¬† Y‚Äôall‚Ä¶ how are they going to squeeze 8 people in that thing?¬† The roof will surely cave in.¬† Anyway, his contribution is one crockpot of chili that is a little more than half full‚Ä¶2 inches of which is grease.¬† Apparently Zach and Whitney take JebJud every Friday night so they can watch real movies that aren‚Äôt dubbed into oblivion by VidAngel.¬† The boys are in the car with Zach, apparently riding in the cargo area and carrying 2 Little Caesar‚Äôs Pizzas.¬† Zach sloshes that crock of chili all over the place while loudly boasting that the sleep over was his idea.¬† Whitney is sick as a dog, chomping on gum while telling us all how tickled she is and how funnnnn this all is.¬† She ends up leaving and going home but not before they make their latest ad for a board game company.¬† All of this was a great cover for the announcement that the boutique is closing.¬† Whitney never mentions it beyond resharing the store‚Äôs post.

6.Poor Lydia Bates has to spend another week creating content in her matchbox sized home while her husband is out and about pursuing his hobbies full time.¬† She takes the camera along while she cleans the house‚Ä¶ and it appears to really need it.¬† She says she is backed up on laundry and the sink is overflowing with dirty dishes.¬† Of course all of this is her job, along with fully editing all of their content.¬† Trace isn‚Äôt responsible for one little thing.¬† It‚Äôs their 3rd wedding anniversary‚Ä¶ does that mean it‚Äôs been 3 years since Alyssa Webster set foot in Tennessee??¬† To celebrate they are going away for the weekend and Trace attempts to curl Lydia‚Äôs hair.¬† He certainly seems to know his way around a curling iron. The weekly vlog shows them in a cabin in Gatlinburg, just up the road from home.¬† They think there may be a bear around and this causes Trace to jump at every leaf that rustles.¬† It must have taken major restraint not to show his pistol on camera.¬† The vlog is sponsored by a frozen smoothie mix and it takes twice as long as usual because Trace. Is. Concentrating. So. Hard. To. Get. The. Words. Just. Right.¬† It‚Äôs hilarious to hear his stilted reading.¬† The cabin is about $500 per night and pretty basic, but they are excited to be there.¬† Per usual with a Bates man, Trace makes it all about himself by finding a way to insert a clip of him skydiving.¬† He‚Äôs in a Medic Corps helicopter with both Lawson and Nathan fully dressed in Medic Corps gear‚Ä¶ playing around.¬† That‚Äôs what this ‚Äúcharity‚Äù is all about folks.¬† A bunch of immature men cosplaying hero.¬† They play putt-putt, ride go carts and a ferris wheel and eat at the famous Peddler Steakhouse.¬† For some reason, they meet up with Trace‚Äôs cheugy friend, that douche-canoe from Parrot Mountain.¬† He has a new $300,000 McLaren and takes them each on a spin individually.¬† As Lydia heads off into the night in this sports car with this leech of a man Trace hollers out ‚Äúremember‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs my prized possession‚Äù‚Ä¶. Mmmmhmmm‚Ä¶ possession.¬† Exactly.¬† They head back home so they can participate in the multi influencer event at the big house.¬† Trace and Lydia seem happy just to be included and they are thrilled to share their fuzzy little microphones with all of the kids.¬† Don‚Äôt want to miss any audio opportunities.¬† Trace ends the week squeezing in one more hobby‚Ä¶ a night game at Nyland Stadium.

7.Michael is back on Instagram to share a September recap.¬† It appears that she kept Tori‚Äôs kids while she was in Florida helping Erin, and there are also pictures of her with baby Miles.¬† Kelly and Carlin both give her little shop a shout out by promoting her nursing covers.¬† One way to tell that these folks are still painfully conservative is their use of these suffocating covers.¬† Michael shares pictures from her trip to Florida with Erin‚Äôs kids and Brandon is nowhere to be seen.¬† It‚Äôs been a month since they‚Äôve shared a new vlog, and influencing seems to be harder than they had imagined.¬† Meanwhile, Esther Bates has upped her social media posting.¬† She shares pictures and video from Graham‚Äôs first birthday.¬† Gil, Kelly and JebJud all went to Arkansas for the event that was held in an airplane hangar, of course.¬† Esther also shares the family‚Äôs trip to a local farm and pumpkin patch.¬† She gets plenty of shots of herself from the back and Nathan just seems thrilled to be allowed to walk beside her.

8.We all knew Erin Paine was coming back to social media‚Ä¶. And we all knew she would dub the newest Paine baby a miracle‚Ä¶and we were all exactly right.¬† Erin shows off behind the scenes of their latest family photoshoot and a camera follows her as she limps to the door to greet the photographer.¬† October 7 was Henry‚Äôs due date, and this is the date that Erin shares his newborn photo shoot and officially labels him her newest miracle, surpassing all of the other miracles that ever miracled. Erin says she is grateful to be alive and knows that every day is a gift.¬† It‚Äôs hard to disagree with that.¬† She promotes Lawson‚Äôs vlog from Florida and says every time she watches it she just sobs.¬† To lighten the mood, she shares Everly‚Äôs crayon drawings.¬† At age 7 she‚Äôs just as good as‚Ä¶ the average 7 year old.¬† In what can only be described as a passive aggressive punch to the gut‚Ä¶ she shares an unflattering picture of a stooped over Chad, knee deep in laundry and titles it ‚Äúwhat dreams are made of‚Äù with a kissy face emoji added for good measure.¬† Homegirl that is just not true.¬† Your mid 30s unemployed grifter of a man ain‚Äôt nobody‚Äôs dream.¬† I doubt he‚Äôs even yours.¬† Erin shows the chaos that is her daily life by filming from her perch on the couch.¬† Carles is banging on the piano (a chip off the old block), while Brookie dances in a God honoring way and the littles are flying around in a cozy coupe with baby William holding on to the top for dear life.¬† While all of that goes on around her, she finishes up editing ‚ÄúPart 1‚Äù of her Birth Story and posts it to YouTube.¬† Now she just needs to sit back and watch the money start rolling in.¬† She‚Äôs using Jessa Duggar‚Äôs playbook of a multi-part series and hoping for enough money to book a Christmas Cabin with Bobby and Tori.¬† Basically she had a long, hard labor and was not progressing as quickly as she normally does.¬† Both Kelly and Tori are there along with Chad and what sticks out like a sore thumb is that Chad seems‚Ä¶ agitated.¬† Unhappy.¬† Restless.¬† It‚Äôs hard to put into words but the man has anger just below the surface.¬† Maybe he didn‚Äôt want anyone in the room with them, or maybe he thought this would be business as usual‚Ä¶ whatever the case may be‚Ä¶ he disagrees with everything Erin says and even as she keeps sweet, his words are harsh.¬† He aggressively taps the side of the bed over and over while speaking in a condescending manner and puts his hat on and off over and over again. It was a tough watch but in the end the baby is here.¬† He is very early and very tiny.¬† Erin sits on the edge of her bed and softly explains that in the vlogs to come, she will attempt to explain everything that happened afterwards.¬† I can‚Äôt help but feel that she doesn‚Äôt really want to‚Ä¶ but she knows she has 7 little mouths to feed and they can‚Äôt live on sourdough alone.

9.Tiffany Bates has been diagnosed with gestational diabetes.¬† She‚Äôs chosen to wear the patch so she doesn‚Äôt have to prick her finger so many times per day, and she‚Äôs controlling it all with diet.¬† They leave California to make their way back to Nashville where she says they will stay until the baby arrives.¬† I guess the talk of them spending half of the year in California only meant the half after the baby is born.¬† They don‚Äôt end up in Tennessee though‚Ä¶ instead they seem to be at some dude ranch out West and if that means Lawson is recording another hokey cowboy Christmas song I will lose it.¬† She shares a ton of Prime Day deals so at least someone is working in this family.¬† It‚Äôs been weeks since Lawson has shared a new vlog and I think they don‚Äôt want to hear from folks asking about the gender that they have no plans to reveal.¬† It‚Äôs a boy, as a reminder. They make more goofy reels this week that allow Lawson to be on film shirtless in his tight jeans and Tiffy to remind everyone that she is pregnant.¬†I was thrilled to see comments from people saying, ‚Äúplease buy your husband a shirt!‚Äù



10.Bits and Bytes‚Ä¶ now that the Bates Sister‚Äôs Boutique is closing what will happen to the warehouse full of clothing? So far they have only offered a 20% mark down‚Ä¶ Even though they say the boutique is closing now it appears it has been closed for quite some time‚Ä¶ No new posts since the end of August and Lacey was the one last employee still hanging around‚Ä¶ Kelly has another ad that she says is not an ad this week for her famous  skants‚Ä¶.Leggings attached to a skirt. It‚Äôs an idea that Kelly can really get behind and even though she says she‚Äôs not paid to do these promotions‚Ä¶There is a banner on her video that takes you straight to the company‚Äôs website‚Ä¶ Katie brings homemade brownies to the influencer sleepover‚Ä¶ At 25 years old, she says it is the very first time she has ever made brownies. She has some catching up to do in her TradWife life.


Have a great week friends‚Ä¶ It has rained so much in the South that I had to install a boat motor on my SUV to get to work in the morning!

4.Down in Borlando Alyssa Webster has a new set of pots and pans she‚Äôd like you to buy.¬† She shows them off through her heavily filtered lens and says it‚Äôs not an ad.¬† She does tag the company though‚Ä¶ so maybe the set was gifted, or maybe she‚Äôs just hopeful.¬† She escapes her suburban hell to head to Aldi where she buys every single fall flavored and themed item.¬† If you look up the word ‚Äúbasic‚Äù I swear you‚Äôll get a picture of Mrs. Webster.¬† Washed out white pumpkins, scarecrows and word art with some hard ass pumpkin flavored cookies get set out all around her house and she proudly shows it off.¬† Place looks like the specialty aisle at the local Dollar General.¬† Alyssa makes it all worse by insisting on showing the decorations through some weird Instagram filter‚Ä¶ what we don‚Äôt see is‚Ä¶ her.¬† Why is she hiding?¬† In her ongoing scream for attention she showcases her chain coffee shop drink and the message written on the cup calling her the ‚Äúfav custie of the month‚Äù.¬† Dang the bar is in hell for what excites her.¬† Her scream for attention is answered by‚Ä¶ the teen barista at the corner coffee shop where she spends her couch change daily.¬† One good thing about all of this is that it must signal she is officially out of mourning for Mr. Kirk and ready to rejoin the world, right?¬†¬† Not so fast‚Ä¶after all of that lighthearted fun she reposts an Erika Kirk post and orders her followers to ‚Äúread the caption‚Äù.¬† She says she is sobbing crying because it‚Äôs been a month since he passed.¬† Alas‚Ä¶ the mourning veil is back on.

5.This week we learned that Whitney and Zach took their 2 older kids and her pee stick pregnancy test to Ruth‚Äôs Chris Steak House for a celebratory pee stick dinner.¬† They all passed the stick around while eating beef and then had a photo shoot out front of the restaurant holding up the pee stick of wonder. What the actual hell.¬† This pee stick is more well-traveled than a Webster kid.¬† Can we put this thing away already?? Everything over at their house is pregnancy hormones, cravings and talk.¬† We‚Äôve got 9 months of this mess coming.¬† Zach even blames Whitney‚Äôs pregnancy cravings for his lack of Bates Kitchen content.¬† He says she only wants to eat fast food.¬† We‚Äôre supposed to believe that just started with this pregnancy?¬† I‚Äôd choose Wendy‚Äôs over a mayonnaise and cheese pie too‚Ä¶ and I am nowhere close to being knocked up.¬† His Youtube may be dead‚Ä¶ but the spirit lives on as he shares his chili recipe on Instagram‚Ä¶ complete with a band-aid on his finger.¬† If you can get past the grossness of him touching everything with that nasty old bandage, you learn that this whole thing is a big ad for a grocery store and a new brand of Broth.¬† Of course Jadon is there to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù (i.e. be exploited).¬† Whitney shows up to hawk some Prime Day deals and then exploits Lily while she eats her breakfast and slurps down her supplement infused milk.¬† Whitney is currently selling about 4 different powders along with supplements, gummies and liquid vitamins.¬† She‚Äôs a walking GNC until the camera turns off and then she‚Äôs first in line at Mickey D‚Äôs.¬† Zach pulls up in the Denali to meet the other exploiters for their group filming event.¬† He has that car tent tied to the top of the car.¬† Y‚Äôall‚Ä¶ how are they going to squeeze 8 people in that thing?¬† The roof will surely cave in.¬† Anyway, his contribution is one crockpot of chili that is a little more than half full‚Ä¶2 inches of which is grease.¬† Apparently Zach and Whitney take JebJud every Friday night so they can watch real movies that aren‚Äôt dubbed into oblivion by VidAngel.¬† The boys are in the car with Zach, apparently riding in the cargo area and carrying 2 Little Caesar‚Äôs Pizzas.¬† Zach sloshes that crock of chili all over the place while loudly boasting that the sleep over was his idea.¬† Whitney is sick as a dog, chomping on gum while telling us all how tickled she is and how funnnnn this all is.¬† She ends up leaving and going home but not before they make their latest ad for a board game company.¬† All of this was a great cover for the announcement that the boutique is closing.¬† Whitney never mentions it beyond resharing the store‚Äôs post.

6.Poor Lydia Bates has to spend another week creating content in her matchbox sized home while her husband is out and about pursuing his hobbies full time.¬† She takes the camera along while she cleans the house‚Ä¶ and it appears to really need it.¬† She says she is backed up on laundry and the sink is overflowing with dirty dishes.¬† Of course all of this is her job, along with fully editing all of their content.¬† Trace isn‚Äôt responsible for one little thing.¬† It‚Äôs their 3rd wedding anniversary‚Ä¶ does that mean it‚Äôs been 3 years since Alyssa Webster set foot in Tennessee??¬† To celebrate they are going away for the weekend and Trace attempts to curl Lydia‚Äôs hair.¬† He certainly seems to know his way around a curling iron. The weekly vlog shows them in a cabin in Gatlinburg, just up the road from home.¬† They think there may be a bear around and this causes Trace to jump at every leaf that rustles.¬† It must have taken major restraint not to show his pistol on camera.¬† The vlog is sponsored by a frozen smoothie mix and it takes twice as long as usual because Trace. Is. Concentrating. So. Hard. To. Get. The. Words. Just. Right.¬† It‚Äôs hilarious to hear his stilted reading.¬† The cabin is about $500 per night and pretty basic, but they are excited to be there.¬† Per usual with a Bates man, Trace makes it all about himself by finding a way to insert a clip of him skydiving.¬† He‚Äôs in a Medic Corps helicopter with both Lawson and Nathan fully dressed in Medic Corps gear‚Ä¶ playing around.¬† That‚Äôs what this ‚Äúcharity‚Äù is all about folks.¬† A bunch of immature men cosplaying hero.¬† They play putt-putt, ride go carts and a ferris wheel and eat at the famous Peddler Steakhouse.¬† For some reason, they meet up with Trace‚Äôs cheugy friend, that douche-canoe from Parrot Mountain.¬† He has a new $300,000 McLaren and takes them each on a spin individually.¬† As Lydia heads off into the night in this sports car with this leech of a man Trace hollers out ‚Äúremember‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs my prized possession‚Äù‚Ä¶. Mmmmhmmm‚Ä¶ possession.¬† Exactly.¬† They head back home so they can participate in the multi influencer event at the big house.¬† Trace and Lydia seem happy just to be included and they are thrilled to share their fuzzy little microphones with all of the kids.¬† Don‚Äôt want to miss any audio opportunities.¬† Trace ends the week squeezing in one more hobby‚Ä¶ a night game at Nyland Stadium.

7.Michael is back on Instagram to share a September recap.¬† It appears that she kept Tori‚Äôs kids while she was in Florida helping Erin, and there are also pictures of her with baby Miles.¬† Kelly and Carlin both give her little shop a shout out by promoting her nursing covers.¬† One way to tell that these folks are still painfully conservative is their use of these suffocating covers.¬† Michael shares pictures from her trip to Florida with Erin‚Äôs kids and Brandon is nowhere to be seen.¬† It‚Äôs been a month since they‚Äôve shared a new vlog, and influencing seems to be harder than they had imagined.¬† Meanwhile, Esther Bates has upped her social media posting.¬† She shares pictures and video from Graham‚Äôs first birthday.¬† Gil, Kelly and JebJud all went to Arkansas for the event that was held in an airplane hangar, of course.¬† Esther also shares the family‚Äôs trip to a local farm and pumpkin patch.¬† She gets plenty of shots of herself from the back and Nathan just seems thrilled to be allowed to walk beside her.

8.We all knew Erin Paine was coming back to social media‚Ä¶. And we all knew she would dub the newest Paine baby a miracle‚Ä¶and we were all exactly right.¬† Erin shows off behind the scenes of their latest family photoshoot and a camera follows her as she limps to the door to greet the photographer.¬† October 7 was Henry‚Äôs due date, and this is the date that Erin shares his newborn photo shoot and officially labels him her newest miracle, surpassing all of the other miracles that ever miracled. Erin says she is grateful to be alive and knows that every day is a gift.¬† It‚Äôs hard to disagree with that.¬† She promotes Lawson‚Äôs vlog from Florida and says every time she watches it she just sobs.¬† To lighten the mood, she shares Everly‚Äôs crayon drawings.¬† At age 7 she‚Äôs just as good as‚Ä¶ the average 7 year old.¬† In what can only be described as a passive aggressive punch to the gut‚Ä¶ she shares an unflattering picture of a stooped over Chad, knee deep in laundry and titles it ‚Äúwhat dreams are made of‚Äù with a kissy face emoji added for good measure.¬† Homegirl that is just not true.¬† Your mid 30s unemployed grifter of a man ain‚Äôt nobody‚Äôs dream.¬† I doubt he‚Äôs even yours.¬† Erin shows the chaos that is her daily life by filming from her perch on the couch.¬† Carles is banging on the piano (a chip off the old block), while Brookie dances in a God honoring way and the littles are flying around in a cozy coupe with baby William holding on to the top for dear life.¬† While all of that goes on around her, she finishes up editing ‚ÄúPart 1‚Äù of her Birth Story and posts it to YouTube.¬† Now she just needs to sit back and watch the money start rolling in.¬† She‚Äôs using Jessa Duggar‚Äôs playbook of a multi-part series and hoping for enough money to book a Christmas Cabin with Bobby and Tori.¬† Basically she had a long, hard labor and was not progressing as quickly as she normally does.¬† Both Kelly and Tori are there along with Chad and what sticks out like a sore thumb is that Chad seems‚Ä¶ agitated.¬† Unhappy.¬† Restless.¬† It‚Äôs hard to put into words but the man has anger just below the surface.¬† Maybe he didn‚Äôt want anyone in the room with them, or maybe he thought this would be business as usual‚Ä¶ whatever the case may be‚Ä¶ he disagrees with everything Erin says and even as she keeps sweet, his words are harsh.¬† He aggressively taps the side of the bed over and over while speaking in a condescending manner and puts his hat on and off over and over again. It was a tough watch but in the end the baby is here.¬† He is very early and very tiny.¬† Erin sits on the edge of her bed and softly explains that in the vlogs to come, she will attempt to explain everything that happened afterwards.¬† I can‚Äôt help but feel that she doesn‚Äôt really want to‚Ä¶ but she knows she has 7 little mouths to feed and they can‚Äôt live on sourdough alone.

9.Tiffany Bates has been diagnosed with gestational diabetes.¬† She‚Äôs chosen to wear the patch so she doesn‚Äôt have to prick her finger so many times per day, and she‚Äôs controlling it all with diet.¬† They leave California to make their way back to Nashville where she says they will stay until the baby arrives.¬† I guess the talk of them spending half of the year in California only meant the half after the baby is born.¬† They don‚Äôt end up in Tennessee though‚Ä¶ instead they seem to be at some dude ranch out West and if that means Lawson is recording another hokey cowboy Christmas song I will lose it.¬† She shares a ton of Prime Day deals so at least someone is working in this family.¬† It‚Äôs been weeks since Lawson has shared a new vlog and I think they don‚Äôt want to hear from folks asking about the gender that they have no plans to reveal.¬† It‚Äôs a boy, as a reminder. They make more goofy reels this week that allow Lawson to be on film shirtless in his tight jeans and Tiffy to remind everyone that she is pregnant.¬†I was thrilled to see comments from people saying, ‚Äúplease buy your husband a shirt!‚Äù





10.Bits and Bytes‚Ä¶ now that the Bates Sister‚Äôs Boutique is closing what will happen to the warehouse full of clothing? So far they have only offered a 20% mark down‚Ä¶ Even though they say the boutique is closing now it appears it has been closed for quite some time‚Ä¶ No new posts since the end of August and Lacey was the one last employee still hanging around‚Ä¶ Kelly has another ad that she says is not an ad this week for her famous  skants‚Ä¶.Leggings attached to a skirt. It‚Äôs an idea that Kelly can really get behind and even though she says she‚Äôs not paid to do these promotions‚Ä¶There is a banner on her video that takes you straight to the company‚Äôs website‚Ä¶ Katie brings homemade brownies to the influencer sleepover‚Ä¶ At 25 years old, she says it is the very first time she has ever made brownies. She has some catching up to do in her TradWife life.




Have a great week friends‚Ä¶ It has rained so much in the South that I had to install a boat motor on my SUV to get to work in the morning!

1o53ids,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/1o53ids/apple_watch_saved_my_moms_life_friday/,Apple Watch Saved my Mom's Life Friday,"My Mom is 77 years old, lives alone and remains sharp and fiercely independent.  She had a very serious heart attack Friday morning and collapsed alone in her home.  Her Apple Watch recognized the fall and - when she didn't confirm it was a false alarm - dialed 911 on her behalf.  The paramedics found her passed out face down in her closet.  They got her to the hospital where she's now awaiting open heart surgery (triple bypass) for next week.

It's honestly hard to imagine that the fact she had her Apple Watch on at that moment was literally the difference between life and death.  The doctors have made it clear that without the intervention provided by the paramedics and the ER staff on her arrival, she would not have survived.

So, to Apple and everyone in any way involved in developing, selling and supporting the Apple Watch - THANK YOU!!

More details:

Thursday night before bed, she had some pain in the middle of her back - she described it like the feeling when a pill you swallowed gets stuck and won't budge, but more towards her back than normal.  She took a couple Ibuprofen (that went down fine and didn't change the feeling) and went to bed.  Friday morning she got up and felt slightly dizzy but not terrible although she was unusually tired.  She went back to bed and slept about an hour, then got up, had a cup of coffee and decided she was going to take a shower.  It's cooling off here and she hadn't turned on her heat, so decided she'd get a space heater she keeps in her closet to keep the bathroom more warm (she's been having trouble staying warm lately).  She remembers picking up the heater, turning to walk out of the closet and then waking up in the ambulance.

Doctors are now saying that 2 of the 3 conductors they'll bypass are almost completely occluded and that  this might be a surgery that wouldn't even be attempted some places.  But they're confident that even with her other risk factors (high blood pressure, recently diagnosed T2 diabetes) still very high probability of a good outcome.  They further say the damage to her heart makes it apparent this has been going on for a while and she's likely just been ""dealing with the pain.""  She almost certainly had at least one (likely more than one) prior heart attacks but didn't know it or connect the dots.

She has some other minor injuries from the fall - a small fracture of her nose and possibly of her right hand, but all things considered she's incredibly lucky.

Hoping for a successful surgery and recovery next week and it sounds like there's a chance that post-bypass she might feel substantially better than she's gotten used to over the last decade as occlusions have built up.  Fingers crossed!

My side of the family are the only ones not in the Apple ecosystem and I was surprised to find the Garmin and other high-end GPS watches we wear don't offer this emergency service.  We are so thankful this played out as it did.  So many small things could've been slightly different and had a much more tragic outcome.

Enjoy the time you have with your loved ones - you literally have no idea when it might end!",115,1760310073.0,AppleWatch,16,1.0,False
