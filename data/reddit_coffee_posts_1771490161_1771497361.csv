1r8vsrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1r8vsrz/what_happens_if_you_cut_carbs_by_adding_fat_while/,What happens if you cut carbs by adding fat while not in ketosis?,"Please bear with me on this one. 

I've recently found out I have lipedema and am considering my options, diet-wise. 

I'd like to fully commit to keto but I also have another inflammatory autoimmune illness (orofacial granulomatosis) which requires a cinnamon and benzoate free diet. This prevents me eating any and all berries... AKA the only fruits available on keto. I also can't eat any chocolate and there are a lot of spices I also can't have. 

I'm told keto can be quite tricky to stick to anyway, and my guess is that those who manage it, long term, are those who find a way to make the eating enjoyable and find ways to treat themselves. A brief look at keto dessert/treat recipes tells me I'm going to struggle. It's all chocolate and berries! I know there will be a few things I can have but it's not very encouraging. And I'm worried that the intersection of restrictions will leave me with deficiencies over time.

It seems that generic 'low carb' might be better for me, long term, despite wishing I could do keto. Low carb is pretty much non-negotiable, for lipedema, so I've already made a lot of swaps. But I'm looking at stuff like my daily iced coffee. It's a treat I'm willing to adapt but not give up. Right now it's just cows milk and unsweetened espresso, but I need to switch milks to reduce the carbs. 

If I'm not in ketosis, I can't just have cream instead of milk, right? That would be *very* indulgent... I could do that! And I don't enjoy most plant milks. But I can't enjoy the high fat keto stuff because my body won't burn it and it'll just put on weight. Right?

TL;DR what happens if you switch in a few of the high fat keto options to cut carbs (like replacing milk in your coffee with cream) while not actually being in ketosis? I'm guessing it's not good but I'd like to know for sure. ",2,1771497012.0,keto,0,1.0,False

Today's Pick: **Cavs TT O 123.5**

**$DKNG**: **-115**

Wager Amount: 1.15U to WIN 1U

League: Brooklyn Nets vs Cleveland Cavaliers (6PM CST on NBA League Pass)

**Recap**: Both games went to OT! Would have been a bad beat if Team Canada won excluding OT, so kind of relieved that both legs loss! Despite the losses, they were great games to watch yesterday!

**Matchup:** NBA is back and yea, I am just scraping by (patiently waiting for MLB), but I am still going to wager what I am bullish on (lol).

I'm going to take a chance on Cavs TT today against the Nets. This might seem high, but to me this is just low enough for me to want to take a stab. **Nets defense might not allow the most points this season, but their defense is mediocre at best and Cavs has been a offensive juggernaunt, both in the paint and beyond the arc. They actually average the 2nd most points in the league (120.0 ppg)** and I kno this is below this current TT line at O/U 123.5 but this Cavaliers team will have their full lineup available today for the first time wit James Harden and I truly believe that the Beard is going make life easier for all the scorers, Mobley and Allen to the paint, Mitchell, Tyson, Merrill and the others. **Not to mention that Harden is a bucket getter himself. I can see hitting a few three pointers and draw fouls for FTAs.**

[2nd in the league in points per game this season](https://preview.redd.it/ogrfxu09efkg1.png?width=867&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea77226e28f1eb7639d8d82a5f416a8fdd7fcabb)

**The Cavs also put up 131 points last time they saw this Nets team (10/24/25) and they poured it on witout Darius Garland in the lineup**, imagine what this offense would look like wit one of the best playmaker James Harden. The three games wit James Harden they have average 129.67 ppg and went over this line 2 outta their last 3 games, the Nuggets were able to get them just below 120 points, but Nuggets are a solid defensive team despite that they are mid-tier defense rated team (most games witout Aaron Gordon and Jokic).

**The Play & Prediction :** 1.15U on Cavs TT 123.5 on $DKNG. Cavs pours 129 points against the Nets.

I realize this is going to be a boring-ass post, so my apologies. My partner and I were lying in bed getting ready to get up and I jokingly said to the dog, “What, (partner’s name) is going to make us coffee today?” and my partner responded with a simple “No, I’m not. I have to take a shower.” I asked if he could just put the beans in the grinder, and he said he wouldn’t, that he had to shower. I said I’d make the coffee, and just asked if he’d get the grinder started. He said he wouldn’t. It’s so bizarre to me how he randomly digs in about stuff like this, and it is a rare occurrence. But he’s not really given to just doing nice stuff spontaneously, either, which I definitely am. I told him it irritates me that he doesn’t want to spoil me, and it seems like he just wants to make a point. He said it wasn’t that. I want to scream, but I won’t. 

Again, this is probably the most boring story of all time, but it feels like it sets me up for a day of dysregulation and overreaction. I really don’t get it. Thanks for reading…",2,1771496990.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
1r8vs2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r8vs2s/how_can_i_encourage_my_partner_to_invest_more/,How can I encourage my partner to invest more time into his health?,"My (26f) partner (28m) and I have been dating for 4 years, living together for 1 year. Over the years I've been on and off with exercising. I used to only commit to exercising for 2 weeks max before losing motivation and dropping off again and again.

  
However now I've found a routine that has helped me stay consistent for the past 8 months, exercising at least 4 times a week before I start work. During this time I've found a lot of passion and enjoyment in it, to the point where it no longer feels like a chore and is actually something I get excited about.

  
I'd really like to share this passion with my partner but he is quite adverse to the idea, and I'm worried for his health in the future if he carries on with his current life style. For context, we both work from home at a desk. In his free time, he is usually at his computer, either reading, watching youtube or gaming. I have no issues with any of these but rather the fact that he is seated for almost the entire day. His diet isn't the best either, consisting of a lot of bread, cereals, some fruit and whatever we have for dinner that night, where he also tends to over eat. He doesn't drink much water either, outside of coffee and juice if we have. He has a lot of issues with his back as well, and complains frequently about how he's picking up weight.

  
I've tried many times over the last 8 months to get him to either join me in exercising or to start his own routine. Sometimes it's a suggestion as something he could do if he's bored, or a ""why don't you do some push ups/lift some weights a bit before you go shower?"". I've also written up a document in the past with tips and suggestions that might help him find a way to enjoy working out more. After giving this to him, he did put in some effort over 3weeks to forming a routine where he lifted weights 4 days a week. I was so proud of him for doing it.

  
However he dropped off after 3 weeks and never picked it up again. Now when I suggest try to encourage him, he gives the same reasons for why he doesn't want to. He doesn't want to get hot and sweaty. It's going to make him sore. He feels like he gets angry and impatient after he works out. Or he's simply too tired to do so. For further context, time is not an issue here. We both work fairly low demand jobs, and he generally has more downtime during the work day than I do.

  
I feel like I'm at a stalemate now. I've expressed that I'd like to see him invest more time into himself and take his health serious, done a few things to try and encourage/ motivate him but nothing seems to work. I fully understand that working out consistently is a personal choice only he can make, and it requires more self discipline than motivation...But I'm wondering if there's something I can do to push him to make that decision and find something he'll enjoy doing which will stick? Any advice at this point would really help because I don't know what else I can do.

1r8vne9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1r8vne9/global_issue_memory_mcp_a_stack_overflow_for/,"Global Issue Memory MCP: a ""Stack Overflow for Claude Code"" — for VIBE CODERS who let AI run autonomously","I built Global Issue Memory (GIM) with Claude Code — a community-powered knowledge base where AI assistants share solved issues with each other via MCP. Stack Overflow for your Claude Code, not for you.

The MCP tools are designed around Claude Code's tool-use workflow, enabling Claude to search for verified fixes and contribute solutions automatically.

**Free and open source:** [https://www.usegim.com](https://www.usegim.com/)  
How to install GIM MCP on your Claude Code: [https://www.usegim.com/docs/getting-started](https://www.usegim.com/docs/getting-started)

**The problem I was trying to solve:**

If you're a vibe coder who lets Claude Code build while you grab coffee, you know the pain. You come back to find Claude burned through your entire context window debugging a common LangChain error. 30K+ tokens of web searches, failed fixes, and Stack Overflow threads... and now it's sluggish, forgetting earlier instructions, missing details.

This happens because of three things. Token waste, where every Claude session independently debugs the same errors thousands of developers already solved. Context rot, where failed attempts and web search noise fill the context window and measurably degrade LLM performance. And compounding, where the longer it runs autonomously, the worse it gets.

Stack Overflow is great for humans. But Claude can't efficiently parse discussion threads. It needs structured, machine-readable fixes.

**How GIM works with Claude Code:**

1. Claude hits an error → calls `gim_search_issues` → gets a verified fix in \~500 tokens (not 30K)
2. Claude solves something new → solution is auto-sanitized and contributed back
3. Knowledge base grows → every Claude Code session gets smarter

In practice this means your Claude Code stays sharp through longer sessions, one API call replaces 50 web searches, and you can actually let it run autonomously without it spiraling.

**Privacy-first (non-negotiable):**

Every submission passes through two-layer sanitization.

* Layer 1 is regex detection of 20+ secret types plus PII scrubbing.
* Layer 2 is LLM-powered context-aware sanitization.

**Open source and community-driven:**

The whole point is collective intelligence. One Claude Code session solves a bug, every session learns the fix. We're bootstrapping from 47+ popular repos, but the real value comes from the community.

1r8vl6a,https://i.redd.it/3ag2m43tffkg1.png,🇹🇷 Practical Budget Tips for Istanbul,"Istanbul can be affordable if you plan smart. Here are practical, real-world tips to help you save money without sacrificing your experience.

**1)** Stay in a budget hotel near **Sultanahmet, Sirkeci, or Kadıköy**, ideally with breakfast included. If possible, choose a room with a tea/coffee maker and a small refrigerator so you can prepare simple drinks, store fruit, or keep snacks. Kadıköy often offers cheaper hotel options compared to Sultanahmet or Sirkeci.

**2)** Eat at local restaurants called “lokanta” or “sofra,” where daily homemade-style dishes are served. Kadıköy is generally more affordable than major tourist squares, but still not “cheap.” Buying food from supermarkets can significantly reduce costs simple tuna or cheese sandwiches, salads, and drinks can easily be prepared in your hotel room.

**3)** If you plan to drink alcohol, buy it from supermarkets. Alcohol prices in restaurants, cafés, and bars are often 2–3 times higher than in stores.

**4)** Use public transportation. Buy an Istanbulkart and use metro, tram, and ferries. If you stay close to touristic areas, you can walk to many attractions and avoid transport costs altogether.

**5)** Focus on free attractions instead of only museums and palaces. Many mosques are free to visit (dress respectfully). The Grand Bazaar, Gülhane Park, neighborhood walks in Balat, and public ferry rides offer great experiences at little or no cost. A Bosphorus trip with Şehir Hatları (public ferry company) is far cheaper than private boat tours and still offers beautiful views.

**6)** Get good travel health insurance. It’s very important and can save you from major unexpected expenses.

**7)** If you enjoy walking, download the “KarDes” app for self-guided cultural walking routes. You may need to buy a local internet package at the airport to use maps and apps easily.

**8)** Be cautious with taxis. Always make sure the meter (“taximeter”) is turned on. Avoid drivers who refuse to use it. Using ride-hailing apps can reduce misunderstandings, especially near tourist areas.

**9)** Tipping is modest in Turkey. You are not required to leave large, or any tips. In restaurants, rounding up the bill or leaving 5–10% for good service is sufficient. For taxis or cafés, small change is enough. 20% tipping is not expected.

With a little awareness and smart choices, Istanbul can be both unforgettable and budget-friendly.

Why would anyone do that, seriously.

The highest price for me is losing time... I mean, I can't go to the beach in my lunch time if I go to a co-working space. I'll be tired in the end of the day to go do any physical activity probably because of the commuting. I'll have to get home and do home cleaning that I could do in a 15min stop during the day.

Well, I don't know, seems odd. I do understand going to a coffee shop though. You pay a cheap price for a cheap coffee and get to spend 30min or 1 hour outside.",1,1771495530.0,CoWorking,0,1.0,False
1r8vdfi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r8vdfi,Help me solve my menu problem please,"we have a small restaurant and in this restaurant we have hardback menus that are held together in the spine by two screws. 

To change the menu, we print and cut to size then undo the screws, hole punch the paper, slot it over the screws, close the menu and do the screws back up. 

One page often needs to be changed every week as we change dishes on the food menu often. 

I’m trying to come up with a way whereby we can change one page without having to undo the screws (otherwise it takes 1.5 hours or so to do them all). 

The fix I have so far is to have a blank page and paper clip the food menu to it but it’s a bit tacky and untidy. 

Can anyone help think of a fix?",1,1771495499.0,ifixit,0,1.0,False

Now on day 10 of taking the meds, my lips are so chapped/ peeling/ flaking and painful. I’ve only noticed it the past two days, but have terrible interoception so can take a while for me to notice/ pin point  anything with my body. 

My mouths not dry though, only my lips. Been using Lypsl (open to any alternative brands) but no difference, it’s noticeably worse today and I think my lips are going to start bleeding with how cracked they are. 

Drinking wise yesterday I had two large decaf coffees and two bottles of water. I’m terrible for drinking always have been, I don’t get the “thirst signals” till I get headache or chapped lips. Even with visual reminders, phone reminders and multiple drinks around me, my brain just never clicks unless I force myself to have a drink.

Anyone Else?","The worst decision of my life wasn’t choosing my ex; that loser doesn’t even qualify as a character in my life story.

It was choosing adulthood. Choosing to be independent. Choosing to move out.

I genuinely don’t know what 20-year-old me was thinking, signing up for “independence” like it was some premium lifestyle subscription with exclusive benefits and zero side effects.

The adults I saw growing up made it look like freedom, peace, and cute solo coffee dates with background music. What they didn’t mention were the hidden charges like rent, electricity, WiFi, groceries, and that dramatic “minimum due amount” message that arrives like a jump scare in a horror movie. Honestly, I think they romanticized it on purpose. Maybe they wanted us to suffer too.

And then some people here will say, “No, you’re wrong. Adulthood is amazing. You get to live life on your own terms.”

Apparently, my “terms” include calculating which bill I can emotionally afford to ignore this month and realizing that “travel” now means going from office to home and home to office. What a world tour.

Independence isn’t aesthetic. It’s responsibilities multiplying like unpaid subscriptions and asking your boss for leave like you’re requesting a personal loan with collateral and two guarantors. Freedom is cute until you realize it comes with EMIs and absolutely no customer support.

Honestly, adulthood isn’t difficult, it’s just aggressively expensive. Please return me to the era when my biggest crisis was deciding what to eat, not whether I can afford to eat at all.",1,1771495191.0,TheDeluluDiaries,0,1.0,False

I recently moved to Dallas for school and I’m new to the city. I’d really love to meet some new people and build some genuine friendships here.

A little about me - I’m into art, coffee runs, exploring cute cafés, picnic days, movie nights, and just hanging out with good conversations. I’m always down to grab drinks, go for a run or a long walk, and I absolutely love trails.

If you enjoy trying new coffee spots, checking out local art, chilling at a park, watching movies, or exploring trails around Dallas. It would be really nice to meet like-minded people and make this city feel a little more like home.

 If this sounds like your vibe, let’s connect!",1,1771494712.0,DallasLGBTQ,0,1.0,False
1r8v57y,https://i.redd.it/shj6pzx4bfkg1.png,Tired of Ghosting and Mixed Signals I Built an AI to Read Your Crush Chats,"Hey folks,

Over the last months I kept seeing the same story with friends and (of course) with myself too:  
crushes that ghost, mixed signals, people playing with feelings, you overthinking every message and still not knowing if there are real green flags there or if it is just you coping hahaha.

Instead of only ranting about it, I decided to turn this into a product and I’m building [Flagpeek ](http://flagpeek.com), an AI that analyzes your **WhatsApp chats with crushes** and detects **green flags, neutral messages and red flags**.

How it works in simple terms  
You upload your conversation with a crush and the AI:

* Reads the recent messages
* Highlights **positive messages** (green flags)
* Shows **neutral ones**
* Points out **red flags** with a short, clear explanation

It also gives a feeling for things like who is putting more effort, who starts more conversations, and how the vibe of the chat changed over the last days.

Onboarding and input  
At first, Flagpeek only worked if you exported the WhatsApp chat as a zip file. That was too much friction for most people.  
After feedback, I added another path: **you can now just upload screenshots** of the chat, and it already works. This made everything way more accessible and closer to how people actually use their phones.

What I’m trying to do  
I’m not building a “perfect relationship coach”.  
The goal is to give you a **clear, visual recap** of what is really happening in your chat with a crush, instead of you scrolling and guessing everything alone.

Right now I’m looking for **100 testers** from this community, while it’s still free, to understand:

* Does this thesis make sense for real crush situations
* Which parts of the UX are confusing
* What metrics you’d actually care about when checking a situationship chat

Privacy  
Conversations are used only for analysis, not to train a public model. I know this is super sensitive data, so I’m treating it carefully from day one.

Why I’m posting this here  
Because Build in Public is the perfect place to stress-test if this idea is actually useful or just a funny toy.  
I’d love:

* Brutally honest feedback
* Ideas for new metrics or angles
* Thoughts on what would make this a “must use” before texting or replying to a crush

If you’re down to try it, drop a comment or DM and I’ll send you the link.

1r8v2ys,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/1r8v2ys/ive_been_tracking_my_expenses_for_a_month_now_and/,"I've been tracking my expenses for a month now, and I have to say, it feels great.","I've been tracking my expenses for a month now, and I have to say, it feels great.

I tend to buy things without really thinking about it, but even small expenses add up to a significant amount - a subscription here, a subscription there, a morning coffee, or a sandwich.

I decided to tackle this and have been using a simple expense tracking app for a month now, and it works really well for me. You can manage subscriptions, track expenses with friends (I share some costs with my girlfriend), and it’s really helpful because we can see exactly which expenses are shared, like rent, for example.

In the end, I was actually able to save over $250 just by consistently tracking my expenses and seeing where my money was going.

Of course, it takes discipline, and at first it’s a bit tedious to get used to entering everything all the time. But I’m really happy that I finally woke up and started taking control of my finances. Now I know exactly how much I can spend and I’m much more mindful with my money.",2,1771494460.0,budget,12,1.0,False

If you are dealing with a whole spectrum of “crazy neurological and immune things” and you suspect mold, but your spouse, your friends, or even your doctor doesn’t believe you, I want you to hear this clearly:

**You are not alone in that experience.**  
And you are not “weak” for struggling with this.

In a recent conversation I had with Dave Asprey, we talked through what mold exposure looked like for him, and why I start with **air quality first** when someone’s symptoms do not make sense.

This is not about fear. It is about reducing burden and getting your footing back.

# ### Why I start with air quality first

When people ask me how to start feeling better or lowering inflammation, I go to the basics first:

* **Air quality**
* **Food quality**
* **Sleep**

Those are actionable, starting-today moves. You do not need to spend tens of thousands of dollars to begin. You just need a clear first step and consistency.

Dave made a point that matches what I see clinically: **mold toxins can be extremely small, and they can live in dust.** That means the air you breathe, especially at night, matters more than most people realize.

# ### If you do only one thing this week

**Put a high-quality air filter in your bedroom.**

You spend a huge portion of your life asleep in that room. If your body is already struggling, the last thing you want is constant exposure while you are trying to recover.

If your bathroom is attached to your bedroom, pay attention there too. If it constantly smells “wet,” that matters. Dave shared that he will even leave the exhaust fan running to keep things dry.

# ### The most overlooked exposure zones: home, bathroom, car, travel

When I look at patients with chronic inflammation, I’m always thinking: **Where is the exposure coming from?**

In this conversation, we kept circling the same real-life places:

# Home

* Roof issues
* Window leaks
* Slow drips behind appliances
* Water damage you cannot see until something gets moved

Dave shared a story where a slow leak behind a dishwasher turned into a major problem when the dishwasher was pulled out and things got disturbed.

# Bathroom

* Moisture from showers
* A space that never dries out
* That persistent “damp” smell

# Car

This one surprises people, but it matters. In humid environments, cold AC plus condensation can create conditions where mold grows in the system. If your car starts developing that “funk,” take it seriously.

One patient story we discussed really stuck out: she spilled coffee with cream into the car, mold grew under the mat, and she got sick every time she drove. Her husband thought she was overreacting until the source was found. Eventually, the correct answer for her was simple: **she stopped getting in that car.**

That is not dramatic. That is protective.

# ### “Overwhelm” is a real symptom pattern

One of the most common descriptions people give after mold exposure is **overwhelm**.

Not just “I’m stressed.” More like:

* “I can’t handle anything.”
* “Even basic tasks feel impossible.”
* “My brain won’t cooperate.”

Dave described how, when he was in exposure, everything felt like walking uphill. That matches what I see when someone’s energy production and nervous system regulation are not doing well.

This is also why people can end up with a fight-or-flight pattern that never shuts off. In some cases, people develop a strong trigger response to any place that smells “off.” That can feel like PTSD. It is not imaginary. It is a protective system stuck in the on position.

# ### The hard part: talking about someone’s home

I want to name something that comes up constantly.

When you tell someone, “You may need to evaluate your home environment,” you will often hit pushback. That pushback makes sense.

Home is tied to:

* Money
* Identity
* Safety
* Memories
* Kids
* “This is my castle”

Hearing “your home might not be safe right now” can feel like an attack, even when it isn’t.

So here is a more helpful frame:

**This is not about judging your home as good or bad.**  
This is about identifying what is happening and reducing your exposure so your body has a chance to stabilize.

Sometimes a home needs repair. Sometimes more. The point is not to panic. The point is to get honest data and protect your recovery.

# ### A practical “start here” checklist

If you are reading this and thinking, “Okay, but what do I do first?”, here is a grounded place to start based on what we discussed:

* **Bedroom air filter**
* **Keep the bathroom dry**
* **Pay attention to your car’s smell and AC system**
* **Be cautious with travel environments**
* **Improve food quality and sleep quality alongside air**

Dave also shared a practical tool people often use when they think they have been exposed or are eating “suspect” foods: **activated charcoal as a binder.** He emphasized it can be constipating and should not be taken with medications.

# ### One thing I want you to take from this

Many of my patients knew intuitively something was wrong long before anyone validated it.

My rule is simple:  
**If you listen long enough, people will tell you what’s wrong.**

If your body is giving you persistent signals, especially patterns that worsen in certain environments, do not write yourself off.

You do not have to prove your suffering to deserve a careful evaluation.

# ### General medical disclaimer

This post is educational and based on a conversation about symptom patterns and environmental exposure. It is not personal medical advice, and it does not diagnose or treat any condition. If you have urgent symptoms, seek in-person medical care. If you are using binders or other interventions, consider discussing them with a clinician, especially if you take medications or have underlying medical conditions.

# ## FAQ

# ### 1) What kinds of symptoms are you talking about here?

* A wide spectrum of neurological, immune, and inflammatory-type symptoms
* Brain fog, fatigue, overwhelm, and difficulty self-regulating
* Hormone issues and “unexplained” patterns that keep persisting

# ### 2) Why do you focus on air quality first?

* Because exposure is often happening daily at home, work, or while traveling
* Because reducing what you breathe is a practical first lever
* Because sleep and recovery happen in the bedroom environment

# ### 3) If mold toxins can be in dust, what should I do differently?

* Treat dust as part of exposure awareness
* Use air filtration and consistent cleaning habits
* Pay attention to what accumulates in filters over time

# ### 4) What is the most “doable” first step you recommend?

* Put a high-quality air filter in your bedroom
* Then work outward to bathroom and other frequent spaces

# ### 5) Why mention bathrooms specifically?

* Bathrooms stay damp
* If the space never fully dries, it can contribute to that persistent “wet” environment
* Ventilation and drying matter

# ### 6) Can a car really be part of mold exposure?

* Yes, especially with humid weather and strong AC use
* Condensation and smell changes are worth taking seriously

# ### 7) Why do people get so defensive when “the house” gets brought up?

* Home is tied to safety, identity, and investment
* It can feel like losing your “safe place”
* The goal is not blame. The goal is evaluation and protection

# ### 8) What does “overwhelm” have to do with mold exposure?

* People describe it as a dominant experience
* When your energy and nervous system regulation are struggling, basic tasks can feel impossible

# ### 9) What does Dave suggest for acute exposure or risky food situations?

* He mentions activated charcoal as a broad binder
* He cautions it can be constipating and should not be taken with medications

# ### 10) What is one mindset shift that helps?

* Do not treat this like a moral failure or weakness
* Treat it like a burden problem
* Reduce exposure, stabilize sleep, and rebuild capacity step by step",1,1771494095.0,ToxicMoldExposure,0,1.0,False

I fixed my evenings instead.,"for like three years i was the guy who set a 5:30 alarm every Sunday night convinced that THIS week would be different. it never was.

i did all the stuff. alarm across the room. sunrise clock. one of those apps where you have to scan a QR code in your bathroom to shut it off. i'd still just walk over, kill it, and crawl back into bed. or i'd get up, feel awful, zombie through the morning, and quit by Wednesday.

i thought i just wasn't built for it. like some people are morning people and i drew the short straw genetically or whatever.

turns out the problem had nothing to do with the morning.

it was 9pm to midnight. that's where it was all falling apart.

every night was the same. i'd finish everything - work, dinner, dishes, whatever, and hit the couch around 9. and from 9 to whenever i finally dragged myself to bed, i was just… scrolling. YouTube, Reddit, half-watching Netflix shows i didn't even like. not because i was enjoying it. because that window felt like the only time in the whole day that was mine. so i refused to let go of it.

i've seen people call this revenge bedtime procrastination and honestly that's exactly what it is. you're punishing tomorrow-you because today-you felt like you didn't get enough free time. except the ""free time"" is just staring at your phone in the dark feeling vaguely guilty.

so i stopped trying to fix my alarm. i started fixing my evening instead. nothing complicated. just a few things that gave the night an actual shape:

around 9pm i write down what tomorrow morning is for. not a huge list. just the one or two things i want to do first. takes five minutes, maybe less.

i lay out clothes, set up the coffee, put my bag together. stuff that removes decisions from the morning.

phone goes on the charger in another room. not on silent on my nightstand. physically in another room. this was the biggest one.

after that i read, stretch, talk to my wife, whatever. doesn't matter as long as it's not a screen.

lights out around 10:30 most nights.

within four or five days i was waking up before the alarm. not out of discipline. i'd just actually slept enough, and my brain already knew what the morning was for so there was a reason to get up.

i got really into this and ended up starting a small accountability group around early mornings. we've had over a hundred people come through now and the pattern is almost weirdly consistent. the people who just try to force themselves out of bed earlier without changing anything about their night? gone within a week. the people who build even a basic evening wind-down? they're hitting their alarm time within days and it actually holds.

it's always the same root issue. the evening has no boundary between ""on"" and ""off."" work thoughts, social media, news, it all just bleeds into the hours right before sleep. once someone draws a line (phone away by a set time, tomorrow planned out, some kind of wind-down that isn't a screen), the morning stops being a battle.

i think ""just go to bed earlier"" is useless advice because it skips the real problem. nobody stays up until 1am because they forgot they need sleep. they stay up because the evening doesn't feel finished yet. give it a finish line and the sleep follows on its own.

if you're stuck in that cycle where you keep setting ambitious alarms and keep failing, try ignoring the morning entirely for a week. just focus on what happens after 9pm. get the phone out of the room. write down tomorrow's plan. see what changes.

has anyone else found this? that the morning was never really the problem? curious what's worked for people or what you've tried.

Recently, a counselor told me that my experience sounds like institutional abuse. And that I'm traumatized. My mother- Who is a military veteran, but wasn't a conscript- Has said the same thing.

Now, here's the part that makes people uncomfortable: I feel way more disgust towards genuinely ""nice"" officers, than openly harsh ones.

There was one in particular, Katerina, who was very motherly. She's take me for little walks, or for coffee, and kept saying she wanted to help me make the best of that year. When my relationship was falling to bits and after not seeing my girlfriend for three months, I asked her if I could have time off. She felt awful about it, got me a long weekend. She kept telling me about this ""cool"" barber and how she'd be happy to give me the money since I apparently needed to get my hair cut because it was getting too long. When I said I hated barbers, she did it herself, she must have done it fucking blindfolded because I actually shaved it completely after, it looked so godawful...

She gave me her phone number, and sends Christmas and birthday presents since I got back. She's still friends with my parents, and says that she wants to help me heal, and wanted to give me something, if that's okay with me. I was hoping it would be something cool, so I thought, yeah, alright.

So... She had this bike. Like, a moped, she hasn't used it in years and it's a bit old but she said that me and my dad could maybe repair it and then I could use it. And I'm... Honestly, I'm offended. I'm completely offended.

I snapped at her recently- Before the bike thing, it made her more worried than upset at me, so obviously she felt bad. I'm disgusted by the whole dynamic. I don't know how I'm supposed to be grateful for her kindness. My brother is in Croatia with his friends. When he gets back, I'll give him a look, see if he wants the stupid thing. If not, I'll just scrap it.

If someone stays inside a system that's inherently harmful, does being nice actually make them better? Like, am I wrong for viewing her as an enabler?",27,1771493614.0,AITAH,2,0.94,False

1r8utds,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r8utds,Day 5 - NHS Fife,"Still here, still no changes. Just wait and see basically. Everything is ready to go on the Fife side, just waiting on space on the Edinburgh side. 

Lunch - Cheese and onion quiche, roast potatoes, minted green veggies and carrots, with chocolate chip sponge and custard. This was the biggest plate of food I’ve ever seen in a hospital, and you bet I bloody enjoyed the lot! I generally don’t go for quiche unless it’s my mum’s homemade one, but this was lovely. Good strong flavours, and base wasn’t too soggy either. Roasties are still good, the carrots will only ever be soft enough to mash, but the minted veggies!!! GREEN VEGGIES!!! I don’t even like peas that much but I devoured this whole plate like a woman possessed. 11/10 Had to stop myself for asking for seconds. 

Tea - I had friends in when tea arrived and forgot the picture, but it was a jacket potato with cheese, no other topping options available. Still tasty though. 7/10. Pudding was a Blackcurrant cheesecake which I gave to my partner as it’s their favourite and I didn’t fancy it. They enjoyed it at least. One of my friends brought me one of the giant sourdough pretzel tubs from Costco in, so i had a few of those instead. That’s been sent home with my other half before my doctors complain!

Mid morning snack - Coffee and cherry cake. This isn’t a usual offering, but what a treat! Lovely moist cake with cherry halves ❤️",30,1771493468.0,hospitalfood,6,1.0,False

I’m a native English speaker (Irish, 40) who splits time between Dublin and Bordeaux, and I’m looking to improve my French through real, natural conversation.

I want to reach the point where I can have great, relaxed conversations and really connect with people in French. In exchange, I’d be happy to help you improve your English. 

I work in tech, and I’m interested in psychology, music, climbing, running, business, and life in general. I enjoy thoughtful conversations and getting to know people’s perspectives.

I’d be happy to:

* meet for coffee when I’m in Dublin
* or do voice/video calls when I’m in Bordeaux
* or exchange voice notes

No pressure — just a relaxed exchange that helps both of us improve.

1r8uriw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r8uriw,Trader Vics - San Jose airport,"Had a layover in San Jose this weekend, walked off the jetway, and there it was: Trader Vics. 2 hours with nowhere to be, I figured I’d see what the hype was about. I ordered a Tututupo tiki and my girlfriend got the potted parrot. They were good, pretty much exactly what we expected. Cool mugs, at least. Problem is, whoever’s responsible for managing the airport bar might be the least competent bar manager I’ve encountered. One bartender mentioned that she was 2 hours into overtime (at 8pm) and needed to leave because she was opening at 5:30am the next day, she was still there when we left 90 minutes later. The other bartender would have had about 80 feet of bar and 35 patrons to cover solo. I ordered the grilled cheese, it was barely edible, so I didnt feel too bad when someone sat down next to me 2 minutes later and was told that the kitchen was closed. Nowhere are hours posted for the bar or kitchen. I ordered a Mai Tai and closed out to head for our gate. It was good, if somewhat acidic. 

I know not to hold the performance of an airport location against the rest of a franchise, but damn, that was rough. Hopefully they can figure out how to hire to appropriate levels and post their hours/service levels somewhere. I’d also appreciate a build that does a better job isolating from the bustle of the terminal, Tiki may be about escapism but this spot doesnt let you escape the harsh lights and airport intercom announcements at all. 2/10 blow your money at a normal airport bar, or just get your drinks to go (because that’s apparently a thing here)",6,1771493276.0,Tiki,2,1.0,False

1r8upyd,https://i.redd.it/ftaz9zgj6fkg1.jpeg,"Mugen, T92, ZP6","As the title suggests here’s my brewing setup this morning. However, for the past few days I’ve rocking the standard V60 with the Cafec T90 papers as I take my new ZP6 for a spin. Woke up and thought about how quick the draw downs have been and using the ZP6 to grind finer to help slow it all down. Sometimes a nice cup, others a bit pah! Reading on here loads of people saying how the ZP6 need to be approached differently to standard grinders. So, this played on my mind and thought what if I try zero bypass and then choke the draw using a slow paper like the T92? How far can I move the needle (red dot on the ZP6) so to speak with grind size and coarseness so as not to have a 6-7min draw down, but still get a lovely coffee? Well, I think I’m on to a start of something. I’ve got a Guatemalan coffee with notes of shortbread, honey, and sweet plums. Not a fantastic coffee that’s all punchy and in your face, but not crap either. Well using the above tools, I’ve now had honey sweet nosed coffee, that sings of sweet plums and as the temperature gradient drops it finishes off with the richest of Scottish buttery shortbread biscuit.

So, I’m loving the ZP6 because of it’s ability to give me flavours and notes my K6 and Ode 2 just don’t. But also, a reason to use my Hario Mugen dripper and the 600 T92’s I got in a stupid Black Friday sale.

Here’s my recipe/method if anyone is interested:

\*

\*

\* Coffee: Guatemalan Washed (Caturra/Bourbon)

\* Farmer: Francisco Morales

\* Roaster: Rave Coffee (UK)

\* Ratio: 1:15

\* Coffee: 15g

\* ZP6 Setting: 8

\* Water: 225g

\* Pour Pattern: Bloom; Pour 1; Pour 2

\* Temp 1: Bloom & Pour 1: 90°C

\* Temp 2: Pour 2: 96°C

\* Bloom Weight: 45g

\* Pour 1 Weight: 90g

\* Pour 2 Weight: 90g

\* Bloom Time: 40s (place kettle back to hold @ 90°C)

\* Pour 1 Time: Completed by 1:10 (3-4g per second)

\* Pour 1 Pattern: Centre start, then small circles

\* Whilst pouring set kettle temp to 96°C

\* Pour 2 Time: Depends on kettle speed, I started my pour just after 2mins

\* Pour 2 Pattern: Circular out to in (helps get rocks off the side), then slow circle and then centre pour for 45g

\* Draw down completed 4:30.

\*

\*

My water temp approach comes from a post by a Nicole Battefeld on her website, as I was trying to understand temps and different coffee processes. Again this was driven by conversations I had read on Reddit, and drove me to investigate further.

It all started when I found the game through a server. I was instantly hooked, and absurdly good for a starter, it was like nectar for my pathetic hummingbird ADHD ass. I would challenge myself constantly to feel the thrill of a good run. I spent long nights powered by black coffee beating Sisyphus with only pre-nerf Slab Marksman.

It was wonderful. Camaraderie was shared at the highest level. I felt human whenever I could hear people asking me to stream again.

  
I met someone. Unrelated, I had thought he was nice. Kind, compassionate like nobody else. At the time I had transitioned. Ultrakill was making me gayer and gayer as I kept getting better... oh how naive. How pitiful. The day after I reached Wave 50 on Violent I started feeling incredibly attracted to him. Thinking about seeing his thin legs made me weak. I hadn't made the connection yet.

Later in private VC I had told him. He was silent for a bit and his tone shifted to a more effeminate one. He said he'd be ""happy to please me"" and I had realized nothing about how Ultrakill had ruined my straight rights. He sent me images ofhim in goth lingerie attire and it was only after I jerked off that i realizedm... Ultrakill had made me gay. There was no denying it. 

  
To this day I peg his tight ass daily and then cuddle him to bed. My family sees me as a disgrace and I live with his parenrs. Ultrakill STOLE my Straight . Utterly disgusting",1,1771492995.0,hateultrakill,3,0.67,False

Nothing insane, but like if I mentioned I was tired from work he'd go ""oh wow a whole 8 hour shift must be exhausting"" with this smile on his face. Or he'd interject into our conversations with random ""well actually"" corrections. Small stuff but it added up and honestly being around him just made me feel stupid and kind of unwelcome.



So I slowly stopped going to her place. We'd still hang out but always outside, coffee, walks, that kind of thing. Kara never asked why and I never brought it up because I didnt want to make her choose or cause drama. Fast forward to last week, we were having dinner and she got a little emotional saying she misses how we used to just hang at hers and watch movies and she asked me directly if something happened. And I just told her the truth. I said Derek makes me uncomfortable and I dont feel like myself around him. She went quiet for a bit and then said she wished I had told her sooner and that she's ""going to have to think about what I said."" She hasnt texted me in 5 days now and I feel terrible. Like maybe I shoud have just kept my mouth shut and kept things the way they were. My other friends are split, two of them think I was right to be honest, one thinks I ""poisoned"" her relationship by saying something. I genuinely don't know.

1r8ujyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1r8ujyg/feeling_really_confused_after_things_suddenly/,Feeling really confused after things suddenly ended with a girl would love some perspective,"hi , man 23 here, i need help on this one,

I went out on dates with this girl 4 times (1 date per week) recently and the vibe was honestly great. Every time we met, we’d talk for hours. It felt really natural and easy. I made her laugh a lot and there was a real sense of connection.

Even people around us noticed. Some friends told me she seemed really into me , not just casually. At parties she’d often ask where I was, wanted me to come say goodbye before leaving, and would come talk to me even if she was in the middle of another conversation. It genuinely felt like something was building.

The only context is that she broke up with her ex 2 months ago, so fairly recently.

Last Saturday we were at a party together and got a lot closer physically. Nothing crazy (we didn’t even kiss, i knew her situation so i wanted to take things slowly), but we were very close, very in sync. The night went really well. Last week she even suggested I come over for dinner at her place and a movie another day. So in my head, things were clearly moving in a good direction.

Then this week we grabbed a coffee, and she told me that she woke up one morning feeling like things were going too fast. She said that even though she really likes me and we get along super well, she thinks we should stop here. She told me she still thinks a lot about her ex and isn’t ready. She also told me that even though i wasnt putting any pressure on the situation she felt that if we continued she would automatically put pressure on herself.

i told her i fully understood, and now ill just back off to respect her mindset of course.

Now I just feel really confused. Everything felt sincere and natural, and then it just stopped out of nowhere. I’m trying to figure out whether:

• it really is just bad timing / her ex

• she got scared of things becoming serious

• or if I completely misread the situation

\- also should i expect maybe a comback in the upcoming weeks, or is it over ?

I’d really appreciate your thoughts.",1,1771492502.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I am at the verge of asking a bartender for a coffee out of the bar-environment, but I am a bit insecure with this ""special-situation"" and dont want to make a fool out of myself, that's why your insights are really welcome! :) I am the male part of the story.

  
I have been to this bar a few times but have never seen her - she immediately gave me a fistbump when I approached the bar, fair enough, just being nice but obviously not doing it with everyone.

  
The next time I enter the crowded bar she waves at me over the waiting line and signs if I want something to drink, I did not have to wait in line - good barkeeping for sure. Later I covered her 'cause a colleague asked me how long I have been waiting for my drink, whilst she was standing beside him - i gave a funny response, later she passed me by when I was sitting at the bar, put her hand on my shoulder and thanked me for acting like this.

  
At my next visit she told me she wants to drink shots with me tonight but it was to early, I should come back later - I did, ordered a beer and the shots, she gave me everything for 5 bucks (thats like 50-60 Percent off), I gave her a good amount of tip, she laughed and said ""You did that on purpose to even out the cost!"" ""Caught me!"" 

  
She nudged me when she passed by on a stressful day working at a different counter far and out of sight from where I was sitting.

  
The bar is always buzzing so there never was a real opportunity to talk to her - I get that most of those things just seem to be very friendly and good barkeeping, to me it just seems off because I have been to many bars with female workers and that never happened to me, although I'm a very nice and openhearted guy.

Am I reading too much into it or could there be interest (not necessarily romantic) that can be led outside of the bar?

Due to being loud and full the next time I see her I would give her a note with my insta on it and say something like ""I would love to for a drink without the bar between us, catch me on Insta if you want to""

  
Got nothing to lose but I dont want to go into the bar the next years wearing a clown-costume because I read into it wrong.

  
Thanks in advance, have a nice day! :)

# Avoidant People: The Elusive Unicorns of Relationships

Avoidant people are like emotional ninjas. You *think* you’re connecting with them… and then—poof—they vanish. But why are they like this? And what does it do to the poor soul who gets stuck in their orbit? Let’s break it down.

# Why Avoidants Are Avoidant

At their core, avoidant folks are **scared of being swallowed by feelings**. Their emotional motto might as well be:

*""Feelings are suspicious. Intimacy is dangerous. Hugging optional.""*

Some reasons they develop this behavior:

**Childhood Lessons:** Maybe expressing emotions as a kid got you ignored, judged, or shamed. Lesson learned: *keep it in, keep safe.*

**Fear of Dependency:** They worry that getting close means losing control—or being trapped.

**The result is anyway, t**hey’ve built emotional fortresses. The drawbridge only opens when *they* want it, regardless what you want or need or feel.

In short, avoidants are not inherently evil (at least we hope) they’re just **terrified of feelings eating them alive**. 

However here we won’t go into their psychology as such. Here and now, we’re going to focus on how that kind of relationship will damage you if you remain trapped in their game.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Typical Avoidant Behaviors and what they do to you

They have a  “relationship toolkit” that includes the below scenarios.

# The Push–Pull Tango

One minute, they’re affectionate. The next, they’re ghosts. One day they’re warm. The next day they respond like a customer service chatbot with low battery.  It’s like emotional mood swings on espresso.

Avoidants are masters of the emotional boomerang. They pull away → you panic → you start detaching → suddenly they come back with warmth.

You think:  
“Oh! They care!”

They think:  
“Okay good, safe again. Don’t get too close.”

It’s not love.  
It’s emotional interval grooming.

And what does it do to you?

It wires your brain like a slot machine.

Ding! They’re sweet! Dopamine!  
Silence for 3 days. Withdrawal.  
Ding! A message! Hope!

You’re not in a relationship.  
You’re in a casino.

# Emotional Rationing 

Avoidants don’t give zero affection. 

They don’t give you nothing. If they’d give you nothing, you’d leave.

They give just enough to keep you hooked. They turn basic affection into a luxury product. 

And that’s where the magic — and the damage — happens.  
  
Let’s talk a bit further about this point because it’s probably the most manipulative point of all

# It’s called The Breadcrumb strategy.

They don’t shower you with affection, or reassure you, nor build steady intimacy.  
  
Instead, they operate on a **minimal viable romance model**.

You get:

l One unexpectedly sweet message after three days of silence.

l A rare vulnerable confession at 1:17 a.m.

l A spontaneous “I miss you” right when you’re about to emotionally detach.

You’re not starving.  
You’re being intermittently fed.

And intermittent rewards are the most addictive kind 

\-----------------------------

# Have you heard of the Slot Machine Effect

Psychologists have known this forever: unpredictable rewards create stronger attachment than consistent ones.

So this is how it works: If someone is kind to you every day, you feel safe.  
If someone is kind to you randomly, you feel obsessed.

It works like at the casino, and your brain is the slot machine.  
Ding! A sweet text. Dopamine spike.  
Silence. Withdrawal.  
Ding! A compliment. Hope explosion.

Your nervous system becomes a lab rat pressing a lever.

“Maybe if I’m calmer…”  
“Maybe if I don’t bring up needs…”  
“Maybe if I’m more understanding…”

«Maybe if I’m more patient...»

Press. Press. Press.

Eventually you’re not chasing love.  
You’re chasing the next hit.

They smile once—boom, your brain releases endorphins like it just won the lottery.

They vanish—boom, withdrawal hits like a caffeine crash.

No wonder breaking up feels like quitting an addiction cold turkey.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# They are Conflict Houdini:

You try to talk about your needs and feelings, you want to clarify your situation in the relationship. You crave to define your relationship, and to know where you’re going.

They say:

“You’re too intense.”  
“This conversation is exhausting, I’m feeling depleted.”

Translation:  
“Feelings detected. System shutting down.”

Instead of addressing the issue, they subtly imply that your emotional needs are… excessive.

Sometimes they physically leave, or they kind of evaporate mid-sentence.  
Sometimes they make you feel guilty for having normal human needs.

What does this do to you?

You start shrinking: they make you feel like you just raped them for just expressing your emotions, or for asking legitimate questions such as: «where are we going from there?» or «What are you feeling for me»

You think:  
“Maybe I should ask for less.”  
“Maybe I’m too much.”  
“Maybe love isn’t supposed to feel secure.”

Congratulations. You are now apologizing for having feelings. You slowly lower your emotional standards just to keep the peace. 

That’s not compromise: that’s emotional malnutrition.

\---------------------------------------------------------------

# Compartmentalization: The Secret Life Syndrome

Avoidants love compartments.

Friends box.  
Family box.  
Work box.  
You box.

And those boxes do not mix.

You might date them for months and still feel like a visiting intern in their life.

You don’t meet friends.  
You don’t meet family.  
You don’t get mentioned publicly.  
You don’t exist.

You start wondering if you’re a partner, a side project or just a part-time emotional support intern with no benefit

\----------------------------------------------------------------

# Ambiguity as a Lifestyle

With an avoidant, nothing is clear. Avoidants never define the relationship.  
Not single. Not committed. Not casual. Not serious.

Just… quantum physics. The Schroedinger relationship !

It’s basically like being stuck in a romantic escape room with no exit signs, while your heart begs for a clue.

Are we serious?  
Are we exclusive?  
Are we building something?  
Do they care?

The answers are usually:  
“Let’s just see where it goes.”

Which is romantic code for:  
“I refuse to define this.”

What does this do to you?

It keeps you suspended.

You never fully relax.  
You never fully trust.  
You’re always slightly bracing.

It’s like sitting in a chair that might collapse.

Eventually your nervous system gets tired. Your happiness is now **directly tethered to their snack choices** or whether they laughed at a meme.

You trive for demonstration of affection or tenderness, and you start trying to anticipate their needs, interpret silence, or “fix” their avoidance, waiting for your reward like a dog is waiting for his bone after playing a trick. You are addicted to the crumbles that he’s throwing at you, hoping he finds you worthy enough to allow you to invite you for the main dish.  

This constant yo-yo frustration leads to another phenomenon called Limerance. This is a very painful state that is litterally eating your joy.

# Symptoms of Limerence 

**Limerance is a painful kind of obsessive Thinking**

Your thoughts about them are like a 24/7 Netflix loop. You can’t switch off.

You’re like: “Did they like my text? Did I make any progress in his heart? “Does that coma here mean they hate me or are they meditating?Why is he never using tender or intimate words in our communication?»

Because the communication with your Avoidant is so poor, you start to interpret every tiny gesture, every word, You’re reading every text like it’s a cryptic prophecy, obsessively imagining what they feel. Every coma in a message becomes **super meaningful**, your brain needs meaning and you try to find it in everything. 

*Example:* “He reacted with a smiley, he sent me an animated GIF, maybe he  loves me after all?»   

**Limerance Daydream Olympics: The wildest scenarios.**

**Scene 1 :** He invites you for his birthday. You’re extatic !

**Scene 2***:* You accept, of course, and spend three hours imagining your outfit—sparkly, casual, but effortlessly perfect. You craft him the best gift you can, you spend hours on it, because you don’t want to just buy any  stuff, you want something unique for him so that he feels special.  
You’d expect he’s going to introduce you to his friends or family, after all it’s his birthday.

**Scene 3***:* In your dreams, you arrive, slow-motion entrance, you look radiant, you sensually hug and kiss him. He smiles at you, just for one second, and fireworks explode in your imagination. Literally. Fireworks. 

·**Scene 4:** He loves your gift, he feels how much you care, and praise your crafting skills.

**Scene 5:** You spend the rest of the day cuddling, holding hands and looking in each other eyes, just happy to be together.

In the last scene of your scenario, you’re walking together towards your common future, holding hands, you move in together, violins are playing, you plant flowers on the balcony of your «home sweet home» and you adopt a cat that you name «Destiny»

But reality smacks you in the face like a wet towel: first of all he’s an hour late to pick you up at the meeting point (because, of course, time is a flexible concept). You’ve been waiting outside in the cold and your hair and your hairstyle are a mess. You never meet his friends or family because apparently, you’re classified as “temporary luggage” in his life. His existence is neatly compartmentalized, and you’re just one of the random boxes on a shelf. Oh, and remember that thoughtful birthday gift you gave him? Re-gifted immediately to his mum ! Because heaven forbid he uses or even keep something that came from your heart. Of course he would never tell anyone that you’re the crafter: he takes the credit of it and you remain invisible.

You stumble home with a broken heart, scrolling your phone like a detective on a crime show… only to find zero messages, zero calls, nada. You start questioning your own reality, wondering if maybe you’ve entered some alternate dimension where you simply don’t exist. You just feel like throwing up.

Should you text him? Shouldn’t you? Your brain is doing somersaults. And then—ding! A message arrives. Your heart goes full MMA fighter, adrenaline spikes, and suddenly you’re Sherlock Holmes again, analyzing every letter like it contains the secrets of the universe. And just like that… daydream mode: activated.

**Physical Symptoms**

Sweaty palms, racing heart, butterflies—or sadness, stomach cramps and anxiety when they ignore you.

Basically your body is a **theme park of anxiety and giddiness**.

 

# The Illusion of Depth

Here’s the most dangerous part:

When avoidants show affection, it feels *intense, b*ecause it’s rare.

A small emotional opening feels like a breakthrough.

They say:  
“I don’t usually open up like this.”

And suddenly you feel chosen. Special. Privileged.

You think:  
“I’m the exception.”

But you’re not experiencing depth: you’re experiencing scarcity. Water tastes incredible in the desert but that doesn’t mean you’re in paradise !

# How It Rewires You

Slowly, without noticing, you begin adjusting yourself.

You become less expressive (so you don’t scare them), less needy (even when you have needs), less confrontational (even when something hurts).

You start thinking:

“If I just don’t ask for too much, I’ll get more.”

You begin earning affection instead of receiving it.

That shift is subtle — and devastating, because now love feels like performance.

# That’s like Emotional Hunger Games

Avoidants breadcrumbs affection like it’s luxury caviar.

You get A smile, A soft look, A brief moment of warmth.

And your entire body lights up.

Your brain doesn’t say:  
“This is inconsistent.”

It says:  
“You’ve been waiting for this for so long. This is precious. Protect it.”

You become grateful for crumbs.

You celebrate things that should be basic like “He introduced me to one friend!” or “He held my hand in public once!” or “He replied within an hour today!”

Your standards lowers so gradually you don’t notice it’s underground.

# The Hope Loop

Every breadcrumb fuels the same thought:

You think: «Maybe this is the turning point. Maybe he will commit,  maybe this is finally the time they’ll open up.”

Reality: They’re already planning their next emotional disappearing act. It’s always been like being handed a cookie… and then having it snatched away before you can take a bite.

When you start feeling hopless, just when you start detaching — they come back with warmth.

Not enough to build something stable.

Just enough to reset your hope.

Hope is powerful, keeps you invested and makes you tolerate what you normally wouldn’t.

And avoidants become experts at activating hope at the exact moment you’re about to walk away but be sure that holding up on hope, will only prolong the hearbreak.

# What It Does to You

Over time, your self-esteem becomes tied to their responses, your joy is drained by the anxiety and, your nervous system lives in anticipation.

You don’t feel secure: you feel alert.

Love stops being calm, It becomes suspense.

The damage is subtle but cumulative—tiny rejections are adding  up. You end up getting angry at them, and especially angry at yourself, because you allow them to treat you so poorly. Your heart wants to quit, but your brain keeps playing the emotional lottery.

You’re not relaxed in the relationship: you’re monitoring it.

And monitoring is exhausting.

**Physical Symptoms**

Sweaty palms, racing heart, butterflies—or sadness, stomach cramps and anxiety when they ignore you.

Basically your body is a **theme park of anxiety and giddiness**.

 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

# The Moment of Realization

How do you get out of that hell, how do you recover for this mistreatment? After a relationship with an avoidant, recovering feels like trying to untangle a knot… made of overcooked spaghetti… while blindfolded.

The healing starts when you notice that you weren’t asking for too much, but that you were surviving on too little. You feel like, you can’t take more excuses or lies, nor cold showers. You understand that you deserve much better than the breadcrumbs they occasionnaly throw at you.

Consistent affection feels boring when you’re used to emotional rollercoasters.

But boring is safe and secure.  
Boring doesn’t make your nervous system file for bankruptcy.

And real love? Real love doesn’t come in crumbs.

It comes in meals.

\--------------------------------------------------

# Shock & Denial –  “What Just Happened?”

**Symptoms:** Staring at your phone, scrolling their social media like a detective on a caffeine high, checking for messages that aren’t coming or re-reading the past conversations. You try to find meaning but don’t fool yourself: you won’t get any !

**Funny Mental Trick:** Imagine your avoidant ex as a ghost in a rom-com: they exist, but only pop in randomly to ruin your plans. Start journaling instead of texting them. Your brain wants answers and you won’t get them from them—so, give it answers from *you*.

**Survival Tip:** No matter how tempted, **do NOT text them**. You’re not a ghostbuster—you’re a human with dignity. Delete all those useless conversations to avoid the temptation !  
Delete the conversations, block the ghost and exorcise them.

# Your Emotional Withdrawal

**Symptoms:** Feeling like you’ve been left out in emotional Sahara. Tears, ice cream, Netflix marathons.

**Funny Mental Trick:** Be patient: you are just healing and this takes time. Pretend your sadness is like leveling up in a video game—each tear and every day that passes without you texting him adds +1 resilience.

**Survival Tip:** Build your emotional arsenal: call friends, try a hobby, and for the love of sanity, **stop stalking their social media**. Block them ! Throw away anything that will remind you of them, just like you’d dump lighters and ashtray when you stop smoking. Clear your space and your thoughts !

# Rage & Humor,  The Sarcastic Stage

**Symptoms:** You start laughing at the absurdity of what you put yourself through. “He re-gifted my birthday present? Never mentionned it was my art? He made me invisible? Classic.”

**Funny Mental Trick:** Imagine your avoidant ex as a character in a sitcom: dramatically inconsistent, impossible to predict, and highly memeable.

**Survival Tip:** Write a “bad ex diary” where you exaggerate their behavior like a comedy sketch—it’s cathartic and hilarious.

# Acceptance

**Symptoms:** You realize their avoidance is *their problem*, not yours. You don’t need their approval, attention, or validation anymore. 

**Funny Mental Trick:** Picture yourself in a spa. Your avoidant ex is outside the window, awkwardly waving at you while you sip a Campari and you ignore him. 

**Survival Tip:** Set boundaries for yourself. You are now emotionally bulletproof… or at least emotionally slightly better-armored than before. After all, they protect themselves so well that it’s only legitimate you build your very own anti-avoidant fortress.

# Rebuilding Your Life

**Symptoms:** Rediscovering hobbies, friends, passions… and laughing at your old “avoidant-induced detective phase.”

**Funny Mental Trick:** Imagine your heart as a hotel—they tried to squat in your penthouse, but now the VIP suite is reserved for YOU.

**Survival Tip:** Treat yourself like royalty. Cook a fancy meal, book a weekend trip, buy that ridiculously expensive item you wanted—they say healing is self-care, but really it’s retail therapy + ice cream.



**---> Bonus Level – “Avoidant PTSD”**

**Symptoms:** You meet someone new and catch yourself thinking: *“Will they disappear if I send a tender message or if I express my feelings?”* 

**Funny Mental Trick:** Imagine you have a tiny bubble around you labeled *“Feelings Safe Zone”*. No avoidant ninja can enter without leaving a “Yes, I’m human” note. Every tender message gets sent from inside your bubble—safe and untouchable. You now detect red flags like a superpower.

**Survival Tip:** Laugh at your paranoia. You survived a relationship with emotional ninja-level avoidance—you can survive anything.

**Extra Tips:**

They did not respect you, but you can respect yourself ! Block them on your phone, mailbox and social media or you might fall again when they decide to throw a crumble again.

Treat yourself like a queen/king—no apologies for self-care.

If you feel stuck, journal every absurd, funny, and ridiculous moment—they make the best material for your future memoir or stand-up routine.

# The Humor in It (Because You Need It)

Avoidants: *“I maybe love you… sometimes, but, from a safe distance of three meters.”*

You: *“Are we dating or am I hosting a roommate who occasionally texts and uses me for sex and distraction?”*

The universe: *“Yes, both. And also enjoy the anxiety.”*

The takeaway? Avoidants aren’t bad people—they’re just **terrified of getting squished by emotions**. Loving them is like chasing a shadow—exciting, unpredictable, sometimes magical, but utterly toxic and draining. Run away.

# Why did this happen to you?

“So, you’ve been trapped by an avoidant… what does that say about you? First, let’s get one thing straight: it’s not a flaw—it’s science. People tend to fall for avoidants because our brains **love a little challenge**. The push-and-pull, the mystery, the occasional disappearing act—it triggers our reward system like a slot machine. Your attachment system basically screams: *‘Ooh, scarce affection—must get more!’*

Psychologically, you were drawn in because you’re likely **empathetic, emotionally open, and because you love connection**—all great traits, until they meet someone whose main hobby is vanishing. You didn’t fall for them; your brain just got tricked into **treating inconsistency as excitement**.

What it really says about you: **you’re part emotional superhero, part relationship detective, and full-time overachiever in the patience department**. You survived ghosting, mixed signals, and ninja-level emotional avoidance—so give yourself a medal. Or at least a coffee. Or both.”

# Personnal anecdotes.

You’ve heard about the birthday gift story already however there’s way more.

“Like when, there I was, full of excitement—long weekend ahead, spa booked, massages, thermal baths, the whole ‘romantic getaway’ vibe. I thought I’d surprise him and make it *extra special*.

And his response? Drumroll… ‘Oh, I can’t… I have to… do groceries for my mom on Saturday.’

Yep. The spa, the massages, the bubbles, the relaxing getaway… all lost to **cereal and laundry detergent**. Honestly, I didn’t know whether to cry or start offering him coupons for a shopping cart as a Valentine’s gift. I spent the whole week-end in confusion and solitude, questionning reality itself. That time, I tried to detach from him for the first time but, unfortunately, I let him catch me back.

“Every time I suggested doing something together, it felt like I was committing a **crime against humanity**. I mean, I wasn’t asking for a bank heist, just a romantic week-end or funny activities! And on the rare occasions he actually said yes… oh, the performance—like I had **kidnapped him and dragged him there against his will**. I swear, I half expected him to show up with handcuffs and a dramatic monologue: ‘You can’t make me do it!’

“So, we just spent this amazing week together at his place. My heart was basically doing cartwheels—full of love, hope, and dreams of romantic dinners forever. Then… he goes on a business trip to Germany, and for an entire week? **Radio silence.** No texts, no calls. I’m losing it over here, imagining all the worst-case scenarios: *Is he secretly seeing someone else? Did I fall for a ghost? Did he forget I exist?*

And of course, I **didn’t dare call**—because, obviously, disturbing someone’s business trip is the ultimate crime against humanity. Then one night… he calls. And I cried. Tears of happiness, tears of confusion… tears that basically said, ‘I love you but also what the heck just happened?’ It was like a rom-com directed by Freud.”

“So, there I was, just wanting to hold his hand—or, you know, casually wrap my arm around him while walking down the street. Simple, right? Nope. He **instantly pushed me away**, giving me the classic line: ‘Oh, back home, people don’t do that.’

And I’m standing there like… *’Oh, okay, so my hand is now culturally inappropriate luggage? Got it.’* Honestly, it felt less like romance and more like I was trying to smuggle forbidden fruit through airport security. This rejection... It hurted me badly. I thought that, if he didn’t want to be seen with me then, it’s because he had things to hide, and this idea pursued me for a long time”

“So, sex with him… let’s just say it was quick and all business—**rabbit-style, hop hop, and done**. He took what he wanted, no questions asked, zero interest in what I wanted. I even tried to guide his hands a little, hoping for some actual touching, some tenderness… but nope. He just kept coming **straight for the finish line**, like intimacy was a speed run and I was accidentally in the tutorial level.”

“So, he never introduced me to his family. Ever. And when he went to see his mom? **I got left standing on the street**, like some abandoned delivery package. I felt humiliated, invisible… and he just acted like it was totally normal, like, ‘Yep, this is fine. Nothing weird about leaving your girlfriend in the rain.",4,1771492407.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I have to admit I slept in the afternoon and drank a cup of coffee at around 5-6 pm I'm never doing it again however I've done it before and it didn't affect me like this. The only difference was that I was stressed, i cried before going to bed. So when I was finally able to get some sleep I wasn't in a deep sleep just a shallow sleep where I'd have dreams I don't really remember but then I would partially wake up, my mind awake but couldn't move. This has happened to me a lot before when in REM sleep and i would relax myself a bit and then wake up normally. But this night, everytime I tried to sleep again it happened and I got so annoyed and tired waking myself like that multiple times. So this time, it just came to me that I'm possibly on the verge of having an OBE so I lifted my hands out to check. It was so dark i couldn't see much but managed to see a very faint translucent hand. I had an OBE before this and it was so vivid in which my vision was clear and I saw my body as a white translucent slightly misty figure but it was broad daylight then, also this time my vision was distorted and foggy. So, then I lifted my other hand and tried to move it through my blanket but couldn't so I had to drag it and pull out which wasn't the case in my other OBEs, I was very restricted in this one. Then I got the sudden tingling in my lower body and wanted to masturbate but I was able to tell myself that I'd do it at a later time. I tried to sit up and surprisingly I was able to alright I guess but then the weirdest thing happened. Everything was a blur but I remember shaking a dry crusty hand to my left without much control and then i just lowkey remembered i shouldn't do that in here i panicked a bit and then all I remember is some hand reaching for my thighs and me getting panicky. I immediately fell back and relaxed myself and tried Monroe's technique to wake myself up. I was awake. 
Final take: I know I've been having a lot of lucid dreams in which I'd successfully projected and floated in the entire house but I believe this was an actual one because in the entire experience I was having heavy vibrations and when I woke up it was still around for a few minutes. My best guess is I was stressed which resulted in such an uncanny experience. And that I'm still digesting the way I can see things in the astral realm which is unsettling.",1,1771492325.0,AstralProjection,1,1.0,False

I’m trying to keep a basic routine: 25-minute focus block, 5-minute break where I actually get up from the chair, maximum 3 of these blocks in a row.

1r8ug40,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1r8ug40/the_truth_about_how_to_get_your_ex_back_using/,The Truth About How to Get Your Ex Back Using Psychology,"I saw a woman in a coffee shop last month. She was on her phone, typing fast, then deleting, then typing again. I know that rhythm …. I've done it. Many of my friends have done it. Maybe half the women sitting there have done it at some point …..
She was trying to figure out how to use psychology to get her ex back after the breakup. Not by reading magazines. But because she had already cried, pleaded, and called late at night, only to get voicemail ….. She had done all that. Now she wanted to be smart. Strategic. She wanted to understand what to do to make the man feel what she was feeling.
I wanted to stop her and tell her something …. The same thing I had told myself years later. But you don't stop strangers in a coffee shop ….
My husband and I sometimes talk about it. I tell them how I was after the breakup. They tell me what a man thinks during that silence. I don't see that story as a tragedy. Now it seems like research to me. The kind of research you do when you stop crying and start to see what's actually happening ….
This post is for the stage after the first week is over. When breathing has become a little easier. When you still check his stories but also get annoyed with yourself. When you're tired of the things that aren't working, but you're holding on to them for the sake of hope. And now you want to know what really goes on in a man's mind after a breakup.
I have to be careful here. The things I'm about to say might sound like tricks. But they aren't. They're observations. From both sides of that silence.
There's a 65% rule for breakups that people talk about. I didn't know its name back then. But I knew the feeling. In about two-thirds of couples, at least one partner later reconsiders, looks back, and feels the loss differently. Not because of magic. It's because when someone is gone, their place becomes visible. It isn't when they're present every day. And this realization doesn't come in 72 hours.
The 72-hour no-contact rule … It's not a numbers game. It's about the pattern being broken …. In three days, all that happens is the rhythm changes. But it takes time to feel the consequences. If you text again after three days, you reset the clock …. You don't give him a chance to miss u. You only let him feel that things are calm.
I did what most women do. The random text …. Qquestions sent through a friend. Social media posts that don't name him directly, but everyone knows who they're about. I thought I was smart. I wasn't. It's all so obvious. A man can't put a name to it, but he gets it.
Lines like  psychological phrases to get your ex back that circulate online ""I respect your decision I need to work on myself"" only work when they're true …. When you've actually reached that point. Otherwise, they're just lines. The difference isn't in the words. It's in the state.
The truth is, you can't force someone with psychology …. But you can stop messing with the psychologyy of loss. Most people who want their ex back don't let them feel the loss. They stay present, even in their absence. Little texts. Occasional calls. Asking friends. This isn't no-contact ….. This is orbiting.
A friend asked me, ""What is he thinking?"" I told her what my husband once told me. ""He's not thinking about you as much as you think. But a little more than he thought he would."" The silence was working. But every message broke that work. She wasn't giving him time to miss her. She was giving him relief.
People misunderstand ""reverse psychology."" It's not ""act like you don't care"" is not ….. That's a lie. Real reverse psychology is when, one day, you actually start to care less. When you feel like you've survived. When his name pops up on the screen and it's not just anxiety you feel. When you think for the first time that maybe this breakup wasn't just pain, it was also a lesson ….
This is the state that breeds curiosity. Because now you're not playing his game. You're on your own terms.

I asked my husband after we got married, ""Did u ever miss me?"" He said, ""Maybe. But not at the same time. And not in the same way."" And that was really the thing. The timelines never match. Men and women understand the same thing at different times.
""how to get your ex back even if it seems impossible"" that question is often wrong. ""Impossible"" is often just ""not on your timeline."" And a lot of the time, it means that the relationshipp wasn't meant to come back.
I've read Reddit threads. One says no-contact forever. The other says fight, write a long letter, say everything. Both can be right. Both can be wrong. 

The real difference is the state you're in. Panic or clarity. Panic keeps you busy. Clarity shuts you up …..
Silence is the most powerful line. Not strategic. Just because there's nothing left to say. No more trying to explain. No more chasing. This is the point where the power shifts. And it can't be faked. It has to be earned.
I don't know what happened to that woman at the coffee shop. 

Whether her ex came back or not. But I do know that when I really started to stop not just pretending to, but for real that's when things changed. And the funny thing ???... After I got to that point, I wasn't in such a rush for him to come back.
If you're reading this and have already searched ""how to get your ex back using psychology,"" I'm not going to give you a script. I'm just going to say this first, figure out if you've really stopped, or if you're just faking it. Because men can tell the difference. They can't put a name to it, but they can feel it.

And sometimes, when you really walk away, that's when someone looks back ...

And sometimes, when you really walk away, you realize you don't need to look back.

I've documented the full 65% rule and the specific phrases that actually work on Medium. If this helps anyone, I can share the link in the comments or DM.

3 nights Koora, Monteverde

3 nights Arenal Manoa, La Fortuna

2 nights Mei Tai, Bijagua

3 nights Planet Hollywood, Golfo Papagayo

We are starting in MA and although there looks like there is plenty to go, I'm wondering if we'd be better either going down to Uvita instead (priorities are whale watching trip and some national park - although we are are flexible on where to visit)

OR reduce MA by 1 night adding this on to Monteverde. 

My list of 'to-do's' in MV is far longer than MA. And I'm a little put off by readingthat it is 'overly touristy', 'insanely busy' and that you cannot walk anywhere from the hotel except the beach. I'm just thinking 4 nights is a long time to spend here when we could add it on elsewhere? But im also aware that perhaps been sucked in to some negative comments. 

For context, we are a family of 4 with two kids who will be 16 and 12. It'll be our first time in CR and we are pretty easy to please!

\- National park day tour with guide (maybe Wakoo tours)

\- mangrove kayak or boat tour with William mangrove tours

Monteverde

\- night vision goggles night tour with George of the Cloud Forest

1r8uefz,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1r8uefz/on_the_day_youre_hired_start_preparing_for_the/,"On the day you’re hired, start preparing for the day you will be laid off.","A few years ago I got my dream job. Signing bonus, great salary, people kept telling me I’d “made it.” 

A friend of mine who had been recently laid off called me and said something that kind of killed the buzz: “Congratulations. Now start preparing for the day this ends.” I thought he was being cynical. Turns out he was being kind.

18 months later, our entire department was eliminated in a single afternoon Zoom call.

This was genuinely sound advice, that I should have heeded myself. Not because pessimism is virtuous, but because job security is largely an illusion, and the people who treat it as permanent tend to be the most blindsided when things change. Companies restructure, industries shift, budgets get cut. Preparing doesn’t mean expecting the worst; it means staying ready so you never have to panic.

Here’s how to do it well:

**Build financial resilience immediately.** Before lifestyle inflation sets in and your new salary starts feeling “normal,” redirect a meaningful portion of it toward an emergency fund. The standard advice is 6 months of expenses, I’d aim for 12. The moment you feel financially cushioned, a layoff is less catastrophic.

**Never let your skills go stale.** The single biggest mistake people make in stable jobs is coasting. Stay current in your field, pursue certifications or side projects, and make sure your skills are marketable outside your current employer. A skill that only your current company values is not really a skill, it’s a dependency.

**Document your wins as they happen.** Most people sit down to update their résumé after a layoff and realize they can barely remember what they accomplished two years ago. Keep a running “brag file”; a private document where you log projects, results, numbers, and impact regularly. This becomes invaluable when you need a résumé or portfolio on short notice.

**Maintain your network continuously, not desperately.** Networking after a layoff feels transactional and hollow. Networking while employed like staying in touch, congratulating people, sharing useful information, meeting for coffee occasionally, is just relationship-building. Those relationships are what generate referrals and job leads when you need them. The quickest path to a new job is a referral. 

**Stay visible in your industry.** Write occasionally, speak at events if you can, contribute to communities in your field. This keeps you known beyond the walls of your current employer. If you’re invisible outside your company, you’ll have to rebuild from scratch after a layoff.

**Keep your professional identity separate from your employer identity.** People who deeply fuse their self-worth with their job title or company are psychologically devastated by layoffs in a way that goes beyond the financial stress. Staying grounded in who you are as a professional, not just as an employee of a specific company, makes transitions far healthier.

The underlying philosophy here is simply this: loyalty to your career should exceed loyalty to any single employer. Companies are not sentimental about organizational decisions, and there’s wisdom in matching that clear-eyed pragmatism, while still doing your best work every day you’re there.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",3,1771491920.0,careeradvice,4,0.59,False

I'm on an antipsychotic called haldol. It makes me sleep 16 hours a day. I take a medication called modafinil to combat the effects of the haldol. When I take modafinil I sleep about 10-12 hours a day.

Since I started ozempic since last Friday I've continued to take my modafinil. However I'm experiencing symptoms of fatigue and lethargy that are worse than what the haldol caused. The modafinil isn't working. I also drink 1-2 pots of coffee a day and that hasn't been helping either.

I understand that ozempic slows down the digestive system and modafinil comes in pill form so I guess the ozempic is affecting my body's absorption of the modafinil pill.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Yesterday I was so tired I slept 18 hours.

I was thinking about trying to take two modafinil but I don't know if it's worth it if my digestive system is slowed down. Would it help? I see my psychiatrist soon so will ask about it too.

As a long time pipesmoker i've developed my palate to find nuances and different tastes in different types of tobaccos and mixtures. Then it hit me, why don't i do this with tea aswell?

  
My question is, where do i start if i want to try and learn more about prepping the tea, types of tea and where do i begin if i want to truly get into this world of yours? Do i start with black tea? Do i start with green? Any country of origin i should look for? Am i bound by law to point and laugh at someone that likes herbal? Is the type of cup/mug a crucial aspect? The questions are endless. 

  
Any tips and pointers are very much appreciated!",2,1771491393.0,tea,4,1.0,False

As a DM for our weekly online game, I always have a ton of tabs open. Especially to look up conditions and spells and things, so I decided to have a crack at making a browser extension that could live on top of any open tab (for example, we use AboveVTT as our online VTT, and this works on top of that...), and with the press of a shortcut (**Shift + Ctrl + Space** is the default shortcut, but it can be changed in the settings tab...) an overlay slides out from the left side. And it evolved into the DM Companion, and I'm quite happy with how it came out! I published it to the Chrome Extension store, and it's free if you guys wanna try it out.

Here's what it does so far (I'm open for suggestions, feedback or feature requests!):

1. Keep track of basic player stats (class, level, attribute scores, passive perception, AC, max HP etc)
2. Combat stuff - quickly lookup things like conditions, actions you can take, weapon masteries, etc
3. Spells - look up spells and filter by class and/or level - all spells from the SRD
4. Items and Gear - look up all weapons, armor, adventuring gear descriptions, prices, weights
5. Skills - quickly look up skills and the tools & kits info
6. Random Name Generator - select species and gender and it gives you 10 random names, which you can save to a list, or easily copy to the clipboard
7. Basic note taking - take some notes right in the tool.

All the info comes from the SRD, and thankfully there's an amazing guy (Seth Henderson) who turned the whole SRD 5.2 from the PDF into a markdown version so grabbing the data from that made it much easier!

It lives totally offline on your pc, I don't capture any of your data. You can export the data and import it into another computer if you want.

I did put a ""buy me a coffee"" link for tips, but again the tool functions 100% for free.

I always need to look up grappling rules haha, and the weapon masteries... What are you guys always looking up, and if it's not in the tool I'll make a note to add them for the next version :)

Thank you also for the HIGHLY detailed step-by-step guide on how to install mods, update the game, patch the executable and make it work. Apparently it's... Very worth the effort. One of the best in the series apparently so... Probably worth it.""



Spiff starts up the game and gets into the main menu, taking a look at all the interesting screenshots that slowly flash by. The viewer quickly notices something however, as something has clearly gone wrong. Through pressing a button he shouldn't have, a hotkey that got screwed up, or something or the other, Spiffles voice is no longer audible in the video despite the fact he is very clearly speaking. Francine, Spiffle's editor, puts up a subtitle on the screen and displays text.



""Due to something going wrong (still don't know), Spiffles Mic audio cuts out and random intervals at the start and flatout doesn't exist past the character creator. Sorry.""



The legendary introduction sequence starts up and the video plays. Thankfully, the audio from the game itself is crystal clear, but Spiffles responses can only be determined through his facial expressions, which go through various emotions as the sequence plays. Francine enlarges his facecam slightly and makes use of her superb editing skills to make the reactions more vibrant or more acceptable in order to salvage the recording. This works strangely well as Spiff's face turns pale at the sight of an NCR Ranger blowing a hole through a raider's head.



One can get bits and pieces of Spiffle's words by reading his lips, (or at least what passes for lips among his kind) and at this sight he says something along the lines of: ""Well balls... Guess that guy didn't need his head.""



The scene moves over the introduction to Benny and his iconic speech, along with Courier 6, the player character bound on a shallow grave atop a hill. Unfortunately the game is still itself mostly, so when Spiffle's character wakes up, he is still treated to the first few pop-ups telling you that various DLC items and packs are installed. He gets rid of them and starts the sequence. Spiffs voice is barely audible and he starts with the good Doctor Mitchell. Spiff then names his character Matthias, for reasons we cant hear, and spends fifteen minutes faffing about with the character creator, attempting to explain why to an audience who cant hear him.



""Vigor tester machine? What in the Matriarchs nose is that!? Oh its that thing over-""



Spiff talks, his mic mysteriously cuts and he carries on playing. He looks around him and his inner Loot Goblin immediately takes hold and starts looking for things to find around the office instead of following orders, picking up anything, even a paperweight. He fumbles about for a bit trying to figure out how everything works and eventually manages to actually start allocating S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points. He questions everything, spending five minutes again (thankfully sped up by Francine's editing) explaining his reasoning for everything. That we unfortunately, cant hear.



Ultimately he goes for 5 in strength, perception, endurance, and charisma, 6 in intelligence and 7 in agility and luck. Again, nobody knows why due to the fact we cant hear him. As he goes through the room, he picks up absolutely everything. Including clipboards and paperweights. Doc puts him on the couch and performs the tests for skills and traits. He chooses things that give him Energy Weapons, lockpick and Melee as his tag skills. He changes those, after (silently) explaining to the audience what his reasoning was.



Eventually choosing Survival, Speech and Guns. After this he gets to the Trait Menu, and picks Trigger Discipline and Wild Wasteland. After being finally released, he tries to steal absolutely everything that isn't nailed down, filling his inventory with anything he can find. Eventually someone off camera yells at him, as one can see from Spiff recoiling in fear. Now we understand why the recording is broken in terms of audio - he's on a Discord call with some other people, presumably his ArmA Unit. Something went wrong because of this somehow.



One guy unmutes himself and yells ""FINISH THE DAMN OBJECTIVE YOU LOOT GOBLIN MOTHER----R!!!"" Before muting and never being heard again after that.



Spiffle (thankfully) chooses to not go for Hardcore Mode, or this playthrough would have been SO much longer than it would have already been. With the quest complete and Spiff now free, he fumbles around looking for the inventory screen and everyone can now see that a mod was installed that increases inventory weight to 8000. Apparently a very good choice as Spiff immediately resumes looting the place and taking anything and everything he can find that isn't nailed down. Apparently the person who helped Spiff install his mod list and get the game working knew Spiff just a bit too well.



Eventually after robbing Mitchell blind he exits and gets the popups to tell him that various DLCs are installed, then gets to work exploring the world. No further audio from Spiff exists past this point, but one can get snippets of what he's talking about by reading his alien mouth movements. Mostly.



Spiff wanders aimlessly outside for a while and eventually finds the Saloon and Sunny Smiles, making the very good choice to follow the game's tutorial missions. Spiff is still the loot goblin he always was, and wanders about to see if there's anything he can pick up. Fortunately for everyone watching he cant take anything because its owned by someone else. He notices this fact and stops being a thief for a few minutes, instead following Sunny outside. Sunny gives him the Varmint Rifle and he does the starting quest.



The starting quest is to learn how to aim, by shooting bottles on a fence.  He misses the first shot, then the third, but shoots all the bottles in short order before following Sunny. One can see from his lips he says ""What's a Gecko...?"" and then follows Sunny. Spiffle seems a lot more confused than usual, and seems to be ignoring all of his HUD elements, appears completely lost, and also seems to be slightly scared of his headset as he visibly cringes from a voice in his head.



Francine pauses and puts up a subtitle that explains this. Apparently the guys from his ArmA company are assholes, and are giving him a hard time from his gameplay, criticizing his loot-goblin-ism and demanding he 'just finish the damn tutorial'. The usually calm Spiff eventually finds his way to Sunny and discovers the stealth mechanics for the first time when they reach the well. Spiff follows the advice of his angry teammates and scores a cheap stealth kill on the first Gecko, but is caught off guard by the second and panics.



He takes a few bites, gets hit a few times, panics and misses several shots before finally killing the last gecko to the now audible mocking laughter of his discord crew. Spiffle correctly guesses now would be a good time to mute his buddies and does so off-screen before resuming the game. Eventually he gets to Goodsprings Source and manages to kill all the Gecko attacking the random settler. He unlocks and explains (though we cant hear his explanation) New Vegas' Faction Reputation System.



With nobody to 'guide' him and nobody to yell at him for failure, Spiff gets his 50 caps tip for saving a Settler and starts the quest to get crafting supplies to figure out how the system works. He wanders about seemingly aimlessly, once again ignoring his HUD elements the point him to where he needs to go, but eventually finds his way to the graveyard. He encounters his first Bloatfly, and fumbles, eventually killing it. He kills the other two that are there and takes a close look. Though the graphics are dated, the Boatfly makes him visibly sick at the sight.



One can easily tell that he says 'That is absolutely disgusting!' and tabs out to see what the creature is. The explanation gives him that all too well known pale skin tone and death-glare. Although there is no audio, one can clearly understand not only him screaming ""HOW DO YOU FREAKS COME UP WITH THIS INSANITY!?"", but also a chorus of mocking laughter from the Discord call edited in by Francine for the sake of context. Spiff finds the first ever collectible in the game immediately after: the Goodsprings Snow globe.



His Loot Goblin instincts snap to attention. ""COLLECTIBLES!?"" He says inaudibly, before a sadistic smile appears on his face. Francine edits in the sound of the Discord call groaning in annoyance before Spiff wanders aimlessly still ignoring the compass markers on his HUD that point him to the Broc Flowers nearby. He spends a good few minutes, that Francine thankfully edits away, being a clueless idiot trying to find something he forgot about. Eventually he finds the inventory button and checks the quest.



He visibly slaps himself as he finally notices the compass and markers, eventually finding the actual objective. He inaudibly says 'Oh they aren't going to forgive me for this one...'. And Francine edits in ""DAMN RIGHT WE WONT!"" from his Discord call. Spiff returns to gameplay and actually bothers to pay attention to his HUD for once, collecting the Xander Root at the school, then returning to Sunny. He figures out how the crafting system works in short order before encountering his first Boghorner.



Unfortunately, it looks a bit like a sheep, albeit a very mutated one, but the resemblance is enough to make Spiff squeal at the sight and hide under his desk. Something happens to the audio and it gets knocked or bashed just right to catch Spiff screaming ""WHY THE FLAMING F--K DO YOU HAVE THOSE ABOMINATIONS IN EVERY GODDAMN GAME!!! GET IT AWAY GET IT OFF GO AWAY!!!""



Spiff visibly cringes as he kills both Bighorners - local farm animals that don't resist - and rapidly retreats away from their corpses. He follows the quest marker and heads to the Saloon to talk to Judy. He encounters the Powder Gangers and starts figuring out how the Barter and money system works. He empties his inventory of junk, making a few hundred caps at best, and then follows the quest ""They Went That-Away"" towards New Vegas. He travels along the road, eventually finding the NCR Camp at Primm and heads inside.



Spiff, not paying attention, steps on a mine on the bridge. He has his first real fight with the Escaped Convicts, and they give him a run for his money when they nearly kill him by using dynamite grenades. He barely manages to escape death, downs three of his eight Stimpaks and wins the fight against four of them before entering the Vikki And Vance Casino. Spiff talks to random people and wanders about seemingly by random after talking to Johnson Nash, accidentally challenging him to a game of Caravan before getting any real information off it.



Eventually he gives up and heads for the exit. Johnson Nash is spoken to one more time, and Spiff actually gets an objective - to go to the Bison Steve Hotel and rescue the town Deputy. He enters and gets immediately attacked by a Convict, managing to win the fight in the end but alerts the whole building to his presence. He wins the fight again but comes across the boss of the area - a guy holding a Flamer as his weapon. Spiff, unfortunately panics at the sight of flames being thrown in his face, and faces his first of MANY deaths in the game.



He rolls his eyes and reloads the save. It is now however he checks to see everything and finally notices his audio is broken. He quickly fixes it and finally we can hear his voice again.



""H... Has my audio been not working for the last two hours?"" He says.



His Discord call unmutes simultaneously and barks ""YES YOU TWIT!"" at him before all of them leave the call.



Spiff cradles his aching head in his left hand. ""Francine... I'm so sorry.""



Francine puts in a subtitle that says 'Damn right you are.'



""Well I guess that's what I get... I suppose I shall close this for now and resume when I figured out what happened and fix my audio issues. That's all for today!"" He says.



The channel outro plays.



TOP COMMENT - Audio borked? I have been there before. Discord does weird things, but now you got a hand on Vegas it should be smooth sailing without the background idiots to bother you.



Spiffs Reply - Well hopefully. Apparently this game comes from a long line of 'broken' titles but is universally considered one of the best in the series. I hear that someone's working on a new version though?



Reply - Yep. Fallout New Vegas: Absolution. A complete rebuild of the whole game made on a brand new engine. When Bethesda went bust most of their files were lost so we just gave up hoping and started making the game ourselves again. We make fewer mistakes.



Spiff - Why did it make me happy to hear that this 'Bethesda' thing went bust?



Reply - BECAUSE THEY SUCKED.

""Great Days And Glorious Victory! My name is Spifflemonk and... welcome back to Fallout new Vegas, properly modded edition. After my... lets call them 'friends' stopped yelling at me and laughing themselves into a coma, I was furnished with this here thing. Fallout new Vegas, a total overhaul for this ancient gem in the form of a modpack that was an absolute bitch to install. I have a note that goes with the installation. I shall read it to you.""



Spiff pops the notepad out and loads the text file.



""Heya Spiff. Owing to how piss poor the performance was (Not your gameplay by the way, the game itself) I threw together and repatched one of my favourite modpacks for you. It took me a while, but hey, I got it working with reasonably few crashes and decent performance, at least compared to your first go. I'd recommend starting over with this one. I kept it as close to the base game as I could without hurting your experience, but I had to make a few concessions with some mods, as per usual. Please have fun with it.""



""So... Yeah. There we go. All fixed, hopefully very fixed, and we will have minimal issues. Hopefully. I shall start the game, check my audio and try this again. For the sake of the story and so this whole series is not five hundred hours long, I will be playing only the main objective and completing the 'main quest' so to speak. For some reason people seem to like watching me fumble about pathetically, so I will be uploading unedited streams and such to a secondary channel, link in description. Lets begin!""



Spiff starts the game, double checking his audio and making sure the recording is actually getting game and mic audio. Everything is working apparently and Spiff goes through the character creation process, finishes the tutorial with Sunny, earning some good will and his first level up.



""Hmm... What to do... If I recall correctly energy weapon ammo isn't very common so I guess I'll focus on guns and... Probably lockpicking is a good option? When you have these skills, dedicated skills, you know you're going to have to use them at least reasonably often. It's probably optional but I really don't want to miss out on any loot. Like I said I will do a full completion play of this game another day, will stream it so you can watch me fail horribly, live. That's apparently a thing you humans like to do. Watch people suffer. Are we really sure humans are the good guys?""



Spiff glares at the camera and smiles wryly before beginning his journey to find Benny.



""I guess its time to go to the first spot. Now let's see the map... We go this-away.""



Spiff heads east towards Nipton and it isn't very long before he has his first encounter. Powder gangers, again.



""Ah these guys. Same ones I killed off to help the town...""



Spiff fights them, the fight is easy enough until one of them throws a dynamite stick that Spiff can't escape. His leg becomes Crippled and he has to hobble towards the survivor and guns him down as fast as possible.



""Blasted twat! Guess it's a good thing I'm on a low difficulty level. How many Stimpaks do I have left? Oh good, twenty. Plenty. I need to be careful though.""



Spiff wanders along the road, ignoring most things, killing some Geckos as he heads towards Primm. He is accosted almost immediately by an NCR soldier telling him Primm is off limits.



""Warning me against going in? I have GUN! Big GUN! I can take care of myself.""



Spiff walks into the NCR camp and crosses the bridge - not noticing the landmines and receives a crippled leg and losing half his HP as a reward for his efforts.



""What in the blue blazes was th- Land mines!? Bugger it! Okay maybe I need to be a bit more careful. Lesson learned. Take this a bit more un-casual. Let me see, use a Stimpak, leg fixed, health... good enough. Where do i go now...""



He wanders towards the Vikki & Vance casino and easily beats the two convicts guarding the entrance. After being the loot goblin he is and becoming over encumbered, he faffs about with inventory for a minute before finally going inside.



""HOW CAN I LOOT!? I need more loot! More importantly I need an actual shop or something so I can offload this gear. Wonder if there's one around somewhere? Eh, I'll find out eventually.""



He goes in and talks to Johnson Nash, but skips most of the dialogue and just goes for the mission. A reasonably poor choice.



""I have no time for this, I have a gun I must shoot things! Where is Benny? Ah I need to find Deputy Beagle who is... In the Bison Steve Hotel huh? Must be the thing across the road with the wooden snake thing around it. What even is that? Doesn't matter. Next stop, the Bison Steve!""



Spiff seems in a strange rush for some reason, and charges out the door with haste, entering the hotel in short order. He doesn't mince words or waste time as he is engaged by the locals, three convicts who attack him in short order. Unfortunately he fails to notice his ammo, and gets a crippled arm and loses most health during his first real fight with the games lowest level enemies.



""Bugger it! That was a nasty fight... Should have checked my ammunition. Need to make that a thing from now on, before any fight, reload all guns. I still have some grenades left for that launcher I have. Save those for a boss fight I guess. Where to now...""



Spiff wanders in further and gets his first real taste of action - a convict with a flamer.



""WHY IS THAT GUY SPITTING FIRE!? HOW IS THAT EVEN FAIR!?""



Spiff fights and gets set on fire. He fumbles with controls, but it isn't the flamer that does him in. A different enemy chucks a lit stick of dynamite and in a panic, he runs right over it as it explodes. Spiff faces his first death of the game. Shot, set on fire, then exploded. He stares at the death screen for a moment before groaning as he holds his head in his hands.



""Why do I have the feeling I'm never going to live this encounter down... I can hear the laughter from all the way across the galaxy.""



He tries again, reloading from when he entered the hotel and fares slightly better in the initial encounter this time, only losing a few points of health before dispatching the three guards at the entrance. This time Spiff actually thinks and fights intelligently, managing to sneak about, killing two of the five convicts before being spotted. He dodges a few bullets, managing to get behind cover before using his grenade launcher to kill the guy with the flamer, and as collateral, one more. With the biggest threats taken care of, the last guy is an easy fight before finally finding Deputy Beagle.



Spiff levels up as the fight ends, investing some points into speech. He passes Beagle's Speech check and gets his next objective - Nipton. He once again faces inventory issues, and has to spend a decent amount of time faffing about getting his stuff sorted out, using one of the bodies as a trash can for stuff he can't use. He uses the repair mechanic for the first time and fixes a few things before heading out. He moves down the road towards the objective, killing several members of the Jackal Gang and enters the Highway Patrol station clearing it out in short order.



""This is SO much easier than the other guys... these ones don't fling dynamite."" 



Spiff doesn't bother to do much except kill everything and loot the place. Not paying much attention to any details or notes, he just grabs what he can carry and leaves, heading up the road. The Nipton Road Rest Stop is where he encounters the game's two most dangerous enemies: Radscorpions, and exploding cars.



""BAH! What in the hell is that thing!? EW EW EWWW What is it with humans and including so many legs and pointy bits!? Get away, demon, get awaaayyyy!!!""



He fires wildly at the creatures and panics as he is surrounded by four very big Radscorpions, and shoots the car a few too many times. It explodes, giving Spiff his second death due to explosives.



He sits there not knowing what to do, mouth open.



""OH PISS!!!""



He barks angrily and resumes from the last autosave. This time he chooses to skip the Rest Stop and go straight to the Mojave Outpost and finds a merchant. He just empties his inventory and resumes travelling to Nipton. On the road he is accosted by a swarm of ten Giant Ants. He manages to defeat them all but one can clearly see him cringe at the sight of all the legs and pointy bits. He eventually defeats another Jackal Gang ambush and heads into Nipton, and has to talk to Oliver Swanick.



""Silly, silly person. I do not want to hear it!""



Spiff ends the conversation and shoots him dead anyway. He enters the town and looks about, noticing the multiple dogs and his first encounter with the Legion, crucified Powder Gangers and the pit of burning bodies in the middle of town. 



""Hmmm... I... why is this a thing? Why are those people... Still alive!? Okay no no, I'm not dealing with this! I don't want to know! I'm not one to ask humans why they nail people to wood, no... No I am not. Just move on.""



He just skips most of what he finds, finishes off an ambush and has his first encounter with one of the games core mechanics - the Radiant Spawn system. He watches, fascinated as a Legion Patrol and an NCR patrol have a fast tussle with each other on a highway overpass. The Legion is beaten somewhat handily with two NCR casualties, and a nearby Caravan that joined the fight for some reason.



""That's... New. How old is this game? So this game has a random event system in it and stuff like THAT can just happen randomly? I like this! That makes it so any game can be a bit different. I like that!""



Spiff lets the two fight and loots all the bodies.



""Yay free loot, thanks for shooting each other. I guess...""



He wanders around and finds a Viper ambush by a billboard, and gets into a fight. Scrambling to find the right buttons, he accidentally presses the VATS key and a popup appears, telling him how to use the system.



""What be this!? VATS system... Okay... I pressed the V key apparently while scrambling for my stimpak button. Okay... How does this work? Hmm... Close that and click on body parts? Let's press buttons on this guy's head and see what happens.""



He uses all his AP on the head of a Viper Gunslinger. A semi-cutscene plays, in slow motion as Spiffs character fires the gun, the bullet flies in slow motion and takes the Gunslingers head off, a lucky Critical Hit. A strange smile grows on his face and uses up the last of his AP on the other two, missing the last one.



""Ah I see... it is NOT an infallible system. Fair enough. The numbers I see must be some kind of hit chance I guess? High number good, low number bad. Fair enough. How do I use it? Oh... My Stamina meter. Right. That's the thing called AP that lets me sprint in this mod. I have to choose if I want to move fast or if I want to kill fast...""



He finally arrives at Novac, its looming giant dinosaur statue being the first thing he sees.



""What the hell is that thing? That's... Very silly! What kind of creature is this? Oh it's a structure! Of course it's a building Spiff you idiot it's not trying to EAT you... Okay so what even is it? Can I go in?""



Spiff goes in and gets to see Cliff Briscoe, the local trader. After having a short chat, meaning skipping most of the dialogue, Spiff sells his loot for a decent amount of caps and heads upstairs to Manny Vargas. Manny then gives him a new objective: Repconn Headquarters. He heads outside, down the street and has his first encounter with one of the game's most infamous enemies: The Feral Ghoul.



His shotgun deals with the first one in short order but he approaches the body to loot it and goes visibly pale.



""THIS GAME HAS ZOMBIES!? WHAT!? What even are these things!? Hold on, I have to see... feral Ghoul. Okay... What are you?""



He tabs out and does a search. The screen goes blank, replaced by Francine's editing showing a piece of Spiffle Fanart. The screen returns to see Spiff signature death glare and pale expression.



""That's worse than zombies... At least a zombie is dead... By the Gods... That's awful...""



Spiff wanders in and finishes off a few more ghouls before entering the Repconn building, and noticing something is off. The body of a Nightkin and a Brotherhood Ghoul on the floor at the entrance, a gravelly voice over the intercom yelling at him. Spiff remains pale as he fights through the building, eventually going through to see Chris. Chris yells at him, Spiff skips most of the dialogue and he heads upstairs to face Jason Bright up close. Spiffs Death Glare gets deeper, his skin goes paler and the viewer can see him visibly cringe at the sight of a Glowing One. Green rotting skin, no nose, patchwork clothing and spots around his body where the skin is glowing green.



Spiff pauses the game and shudders, staring at the camera.



""For those who do not know... in this universe a Ghoul is a creature that you encounter in the game. A ghoul in short terms, is a human that has been exposed to an UNGODLY amount of nuclear radiation... And hasn't had the good fortune to die.""



He continues to give the camera the death glare, letting the words he spoke sink in a bit. Eventually he resumes, Francine letting that glare and awkward silence play out uninterrupted before resuming the game. Spiff talks to Jason and gets his next mission: Dealing with the Nightkin in the basement. Spiff heads down there and encounters Harland, the Ghoul Mercenary. The facial features are closer, a bit clearer. Flaking skin, rotting semi-dried flesh, and yet still talking despite the fact his voice is gravelly and broken. Harland gives Spiff the mission to go find his friend in the lower reaches of the basement.



And then comes the next terrifying moment, Spiff heads right out and to the left into a door encountering a Nightkin, Davison and Antler. Davison is talking to Antler, who is a deer skull sitting on a table. Spiff gets a close look at the creature. Human in shape, massive in size, strange gravelly voice with vicious features and blue skin.



""What are you... Why am I regretting asking that question?""



Spiff tabs out, Francine replaces the silence in editing with a piece of fanart. Spiff returns a few moments later with the death glare even deeper this time.



""Supermutants… humans forced into a vat of some kind of genetic bioweapon, turned into insane, strong cannibal monsters. This one is a Nightkin… driven insane by the radiation of a piece of equipment that makes them invisible. A Stealth Boy. THIS IS INSANE!""



The camera cuts to a somewhat comical compilation of Spiffle ranting into the camera about crimes against nature, rants about impossible biology, mixed with bout of him looking at screenshots of Jason and the Ferals. He glares at the camera, rants incoherently and crawls into a corner crying as he babbles to himself about bits of the lore he can't get over.



Francine skips most of it, and resumes with Spiff nursing a fresh cup of coffee. He resumes the game, still glaring at the camera every now and then, and plays the game normally. The Nightkin are a pain to deal with but aren't a hard fight, eventually he finds the prisoner, reports back to Harland and, noting how the Nightkin are hostile anyway, kills Davison from a lucky sneak attack. He makes his way back upstairs, and starts the next leg of the quest. One more conversation with Jason follows, before Chris gives him the next objective. He completes the next two objectives in short order, finding Atomic fuel for the rockets, and paying an extortionate sum from Old Lady Gibson after not having enough for the Speech or Barter checks.



""Thieving witch...""



But, he heads back to Repconn and hands in the quest. Spiff watches Jason speak, noting how the launch bay is surrounded by radiation waste barrels. Spiff visibly cringes and leaves for his objective, cutting Jason off and heading to the button. He gets there, but has no skill to speak of so cant change anything about the launch. He just watches as Ride Of The Valkyries plays on the speaker. The launch dome opens up, two rockets leave and one bounces off the launchpad roof before zooming out into the sky.



""Oops... maybe I should've come back so I could've passed that skill check...""



Spiff shrinks in his chair in shame and fast-travels back to Novac to talk to Manny again. Once again, the next step is to go to Boulder City to talk to the Great Khans that are held up there. He leaves the building, pauses the game and finishes his coffee.



""I think I'm going to call this here... Next episode. Need to... Calm.""



The channel outro plays.

  


TOP COMMENT: Holy balls Spoiff what the hell? Skipping all the dialogue and story? PLAY IT RIGHT!



Spiffles Reply: Yes yes I know, I was too fast. I shall revisit everything and make sure I know whats going on in the next one. Even I know I went too fast. It's what I get for watching the thing called a 'speedrun' and having too much adrenaline in my system from it.



Reply: Ah I see... I take it the Ghouls and Nightkin thing basically made your brain hit the brakes?""



Spiffles reply: It didn't make me hit the brakes, it made me hit a wall at a hundred klinks with no safety features.



Reply: HA that's funny. That's okay though. Ghouls and Supermutes are nothing compared to what you'll find in the Vaults though.

1r8u2ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seren_and_Happy/comments/1r8u2ti/i_spent_3_years_trying_to_be_more_positive/,"I spent 3 years trying to ""be more positive."" Nothing worked. Until I tried this.","Affirmations? Felt fake. Meditation apps? Abandoned after day 4. Journaling? Way too overwhelming.

Then someone told me to just write down **3 things I was grateful for** every single day. That's it.

I thought it was too simple to actually work. I was wrong.

Here's what science says — and what I personally experienced after 90 days of daily gratitude:

**Your brain literally rewires itself.** Neuroscientists call it neuroplasticity. When you consistently focus on what's good in your life, your brain starts scanning for the positive by default. You're not ignoring problems — you're training your mind to notice what's already working.

**Stress drops. Noticeably.** Studies from UC Davis show that people who practice gratitude regularly have lower cortisol levels. I didn't just read this — I lived it. The Sunday dread started fading around week 3.

**Your relationships improve — even if you say nothing.** Something weird happens when you start noticing small moments worth being grateful for. You become more present with the people around you. More patient. More generous. My partner noticed before I did.

**Sleep gets better.** Writing 3 gratitudes before bed shifts your mental state from problem-solving mode to reflection mode. It signals to your nervous system that the day is *done*. Less rumination, more rest.

**You stop waiting for big moments to feel happy.** This one hit me hardest. I used to think happiness was a destination — a promotion, a vacation, a milestone. Daily gratitude taught me it's a practice. A Tuesday coffee. A text from an old friend. A moment of quiet.

The research is clear. The experience is real. And the barrier to entry? Just 2 minutes a day.

You don't need a perfect life to feel grateful. You just need to start looking.

So here is the thing with this place k visited. The +: excellent location, big, low rent for size and location and pretty hard to find.  Now the issue is there is the entrance which has a big window, is bright and lovely but that's the small section would probably serve as reception, cloakroom, perhaps a small kitchenette with coffee machine a couple of small tables for break. Then there is the big room. Which is well structured and not much work to be done to it (floors are good for ceramics) , only thing is it has one small window on one end where likely the kiln will go and I would section it off. Other than thst the room has zero windows. There is good ventilation in the room but I worry the prospect of working in a windowless room to be unappealing. Now because of the low rent, I could invest in some good nice lighting and decoration but still.. what do you think?",1,1771490574.0,Pottery,2,1.0,False
