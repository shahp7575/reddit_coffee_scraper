Putting less than $50 into DeFi “auto-mining” and expecting serious returns isn’t investing, it’s more like testing vibes with Monopoly money.

I’ve tried a few of these “smart” miners over the past month, and most of them seem to just wrap existing protocols with slick dashboards. The returns? Meh — unless you’re dropping $500+ into the pool, the APY barely moves the needle. 

I keep seeing people post about making $1–$2 per day like it's some passive income breakthrough. Not to knock the hustle, but… that’s less than a coffee.

Curious what the folks here think:

Is there any DeFi auto-yield tool that delivers at low capital?

Or are these products just built to skim fees from small fish?

Not looking to shill anything, just sharing thoughts. I did find one that’s performed better than expected, but I’ll hold off mentioning it unless it adds value to the thread.",1,1744937593.0,defi,0,1.0,False
1k1sh93,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1k1sh93/from_atheist_to_mormon_to_exmo/,From atheist to Mormon to exmo,"This is basically me wanting to get my church story out there; and trying to figure out where to go from here. Especially when it comes to breaking this news to my mom. 

Okay, let me get some context out of the way. I was a Mormon convert. When I was 11, I was baptized into the Mormon church, and had grown up in a highly dangerous home for a long time before. I was a foster child for 3 years and lived with my now adoptive family for 2 of those years before I was adopted. I fell in love with the Mormon church because it implied I wasn't alone. (Not that I ever was, but the fact I needed someone to tell me that there's this big guy in the sky watching over me to finally feel at least partially safe to be a kid at 10yrs old kinda feels... wrong.) 

I remember very distinctly in my mind asking after the first few weeks of being in church to be baptized and my mom, then fostering me, told me ""You shouldn't be baptized into a church you're not staying in."" I remember being so confused about why I would not be in the church. I have had a few moments where I felt the ""spirit,"" one in particular that I will never deny happened to me, was at a baptism for my mom's friend's friend who converted. They read the first verse of the BoM and I got hit with the revelation that this would be my family. And they did become my family, I love them all dearly, and truly. 

Now the problems hit when I got to high school. I was a Freshman at the height of the pandemic so my first year in high school, I practically had (almost) free reign to the internet, which was a first for me as I was very sheltered, no personal phone or laptop and I didn't get my first fully free to use as I wish phone until I moved out of the house on my own accord. Well, it was also the first time my blinders were removed to tell me that gay people did exist. I ended up watching a lot of reddit meme readers (Jammidodger & OneTopic were my gay gateway) and I ended up having a crush on a person in my stagecraft class. The panic settled in really quickly. I went through mental turmoil over the fact I suddenly was no longer in the demographic of perfect Mormon girls. 

It didn't help that the Thanksgiving that year, I had had a severe mental spiral and hated being around people. I ended up bursting into tears in front of my extended family, and got sent up to a room to sleep (my mom's #1 coping skill for me). I ended up staring at the fan, thinking about my identity as a person. It was in those moments I realized I wasn't cis, but due to the unaccepting nature of my mother and how ""God made you this way, you are this way and if you try to change it you're disgracing God..."" I've heard it all from my mom and did for years until I just stopped trying to explain it to her. 

It wasn't long after I began doubting the church. I wasn't cis and I wasn't straight by any stretch of the imagination. I remember walking into the temple and walking into my side of the bathrooms and feeling like a puzzle piece that was in the wrong puzzle box. The temple was supposed to be holy. I had never felt anything but wet and cold after a visit to the temple. So, I ended up going to my bishop on the next temple recommendation interview and I ended up telling him I wasn't going by my pronouns that we're assigned to me at birth and that I (wait for it) *drank coffee!* My temple recommend rights were stripped away from me and it made me so unbelievably happy. I didn't have to deal with any trips involving the temple anymore and I would no longer feel out of place. (And I could enjoy my coffee without looking over my shoulder).

I ended up confessing to my mom that I wanted to leave the church not long after. I expressed to her that I needed it when it came to me but I don't need it now, that I still believed in God, and that I wasn't abandoning all my morals. She had given me a sad and disappointed look, saying that, ""I'm sad, it feels like you're giving up on God."" Now, I love my mother dearly, she's very special to me and will not stress this more but I chose her to be my mother for a reason, but her saying this is exactly why I've been moved out for a year and still haven't told her I don't want anything to do with the church. 

As I said in the last paragraph, I moved out (a little over) a year ago. My mom packed a BoM and I had grabbed an in-depth look into the Family Proclamation to the World as my mom had suggested I read it so I'm able to tell the difference between lust and love (something I would consider myself very good at noticing since I am asexual and a smut writer). Well, I haven't picked up either books since unpacking. They've been taking up space and I don't even go by the name on the BoM anymore. (I can hear a church leader telling me I need to read the book to feel connected to God). Well, something personal happened that I won't go into detail to since it left such a mark on me and still affects me so I'm still healing from it, and it made me averse to the opposite gender of my GAB for a long time (nearly a year), and I realized I couldn't be in a place where it would be frowned upon of me marrying the same sex. I completely cut ties with the church, avoiding Sundays with my family and trying to shut down any conversation about the church (most recently general conference) with a ""Hm. Maybe."" 

It's come to the point my mom wants me to come home a little more often so that we can work on repairing the fragile relationship we have had since I have attempted (up for interpretation) and she knows how much I dislike the place I live (Job Corps) so me leaving early on weekends I get off and am allowed to go home because my family isn't out of town with volleyball tourneys which is a semi-rare occasion. I want to tell my mom I am no longer participating in the church but I just can't bare to have the look of disappointment or tone of disappointment again. ",1,1744937454.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False
1k1sgkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k1sgkk/want_to_quit_a_job_a_friend_recommended_me_for/,Want to quit a job a friend recommended me for,"Basically the title. I started a job a friend recommended me for at a coffee and food shop. 

I was actually very excited for this because I desperately needed to leave my old restaurant job (there were alot of management issues that caused multiple people to leave). 

He kept telling his manager to interview me when a position opened. A position for opening shift as a barista came about, and I pretty much instantly got the job. 

I’m so extremely grateful to my friend for only saying nice things about me to the staff, and his manager, but I’m not sure this job is for me. It’s only been 3 days, but I’m already no sure if this position is for me. Start time is 5:30am, but I need to be up and fully ready by 4:30am. The pay is very low (around $6.50 + tips that you split), and the environment is a little TOO fast paced. I understand jobs will always be fast paced, but I’ve been observing and lightly participating in the rushes, and it’s just a little too chaotic for me (props to the baristas that can do it because wow). 

I just am conflicted because of my friend recommending me the job. I dont want me potentially finding another job to put a strain on anything.

There's this guy in woodbury who's been doing this thing for a couple of years where he just walks up and down the street waving an american flag or a israel flag while wearing a MAGA hat.

Let me tell you, this man was indeed taken straight out of South park. 
None of the employees at my caribou would ever want to take his order and we actively avoided him and we would try to dodge taking his order, because he would just talk and talk and talk to whoever had the unfortunate turn of taking his order. 
He also was a cheapskate. He would often ask for free upcharges, or just ask for a cup of hot water to stir in his coffee packet 😭. and he once brought in his own coffee creamer

# ✴️ Chapter Four – “Settling In”

**Part One: Boxes and Echoes**

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the door slid shut behind him, the faint scent of his own space followed.  
Quiet. Empty. Waiting to become something more.

It was 4:00 PM.

Cael made his way down the quiet corridor, Bracelink guiding him toward Storage Bay C-4. His boots echoed against the polished floor, alone but not unwatched—some of the motion sensors blinked quietly as he passed. The Spire had a way of feeling alive, even when no one was around.

The bay was utilitarian—high ceilings, clean-lined, with a handful of other deliveries mid-sort. A few staffers were scanning crates, and a pair of delivery bots hovered in place like bored pets.

“Cadet Rowan,” one of the human clerks called, checking a console. “Looks like you’ve got… a lot.”

Cael squinted toward the back as **eight hover transport bots** eased into motion, each stacked with sealed crates, bags, tubes, and padded boxes. A few plants peeked out from one, their leaves twitching from the motion sensors.

He let out a long breath. “Of course I do.”

By 4:38 PM, Cael was back at his dorm, door wide, the bots gliding in one by one like oversized ducks in a line.

They gently offloaded the crates into the living room, spreading them out across the open floor in neat rows.

Then, they waited—silent, humming faintly.

Cael looked around at the mess of sealed boxes and sighed.

“Cool. Totally fine. Just me, eight bots, and a metric ton of my life to assemble by myself,” he muttered. “No big deal.”

One bot beeped. Cael shot it a look. “You hush.”

He cracked his knuckles, dropped to a crouch, and started tearing into the easiest stuff first.

# ✦ Bedroom

Clothes went into the storage closet one piece at a time. Uniforms to the left, casuals to the right. Old hoodies, threadbare shirts with sentimental holes—he kept those, even if they didn’t belong here. A rat didn’t just let go of his skin that easy.

The yoga mat landed near the bed. Weights tucked under the side table.  
He paused, turned, and unrolled the protective wrap on the frame bundle.

There they were.

Photos from the port. Of the trio. Of Bee grinning with sunburn. Dino mid-glare at a half-cooked fish. All rough-edged, scuffed, printed on cheap sheets or sticky-backs.

He moved carefully. Mounting each one above the desk or beside the mural. One by one.

When he stepped back, the room shifted.

It felt… *real* now. Not just assigned.  
Like something human had bled into it. Something that *belonged*.

He stood still for a minute. Let it hit.

Memories swept through like a crosswind—warm food over barrels, Bee kicking her legs while balancing on a railing, Dino cursing at a busted fuse while Cael laughed with a wrench in his mouth.

It passed, but didn’t leave.

“Alright,” he muttered. “No time for a breakdown. I’ve got a kitchen to conquer.”

# ✦ Kitchen

Food first. Cold perishables into the fridge—meats stacked on the left, dairy and produce on the right. Snacks on the top shelf, where he could pretend to forget them.

Then came the spices.

The *insane* amount of spices.

Human brands, sure. But also three Vaelari blends in scent-sealed canisters, some of them gifted, some bartered. One was from a merchant who swore it would “make your bones sing like fire.”

Drawers filled. Shelves stocked. By the time he stepped back, the kitchen *smelled* like memory and ambition.

Then he opened the last crate.

Massive. Overpacked. He peeled away the padding—

—and there it was.

An **industrial-grade coffee machine**. Fully kitted. Chrome panels, double-nozzle system, memory-coded heat settings. Ridiculous. Gorgeous. Clearly customized.

Taped to the side was a note in all-caps:  
**“DON’T BREAK THIS OR I’LL BREAK YOU. – D”**

Cael barked out a laugh that echoed in the empty room.

“Classic Damien,” he said, hand on his hip. “You’re just thinking about efficiency—hah. Guess some things never change.”

He set it up carefully. Corded it in. Primed it. Didn’t even brew a cup—just looked at it for a second like it was a photo of someone he missed.

Then got back to work.

# ✦ Living Room

The plants came next—six full-bloom varieties, all scent-adaptive, all picked specifically for low-maintenance air-purification.

One by one, he placed them into corners, near windows, beside the holo-console. Always clear of walking zones. Always with intention.

He knelt to adjust a pot near the couch corner, then paused—eyes scanning the posters and little mementos in the next crate. They weren’t special. Not like the mural. But they were his.

A half-faded sketch of their old port café. A tourist print Bee picked up just to make him laugh. A shipping poster Dino once used as a blanket in a bet.

He pinned them to the wall with soft adhesive and care.

Finally came the beast: **the modular bed-sofa**.

It took fifteen minutes, a curse or six, and one almost-smashed toe—but it unfolded like a dream.

Three Dinos wide. Five humans. A goddamn lounge fort from the stars.

He collapsed onto it when it was done, letting out a long groan. The cushions swallowed him like clouds that owed him money.

“Worth it,” he whispered, staring up at the ceiling. “This better be the comfiest damn nap spot in the galaxy.”

He rolled up, flexed sore arms, and gave the room a final look.

It smelled faintly of spiced warmth and recycled nostalgia. It looked like someone lived here now. Someone who’d fought for it.

And it was *his*.

End of Part One: **7:44 PM**

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Chapter 4 – “Settling In”**

**Part Two: Little Cally and the Portside Three**

By the time the last drawer in the bathroom closed, Cael’s hands were dragging. Not tired exactly, just... used up.

He’d slotted his shampoo and conditioner into the recessed shelf by the shower, lined his toothbrush and mouthwash next to a sleek cup, folded two sets of towels onto the rack, and stocked the laundry shelf with fabric softener and detergent like it actually mattered.

The space looked clean. Whole. Calming.

“Finally,” he muttered, rubbing his eyes.

Back in the living room, the scent of spice and green leaves clung to the air now—soft, warm, like the dorm had started to breathe with him. He passed his plants, gave one a light nudge like it was a dog in the way, and made for the kitchen.

Dinner was simple.  
Pan-seared flatbread, rehydrated stew mix with a few spice tweaks, and a protein wrap with those cheap-but-tasty flavor strips they used to hoard back home. Half of it was muscle memory. The other half was just comfort.

At **08:12 PM**, he dropped onto the edge of the couch, balanced the plate on his knee, and opened his Bracelink.

>

**Cael**:  
I'm done settling up. Thanks for the gifts, you two.

📸 *\[Image: Dino’s industrial coffee machine, shining under perfect kitchen light\]*.

📸 *\[Image: Bee’s massive bed, sheets still a little rumpled from the setup\]*.

The reply came fast.

**Dino**:  
You're welcome, Rowy. But *don’t break it*. I had to ask for a few favors and pay quite a few credits for that thing. 💸

**Bee**:  
🐝❤️ You're welcome, Cally. *Buzz buzz*\~

**Cael**:  
Hahaha.  
Alright, btw—when are you guys coming over? While I’m thankful I got this weird room dorm... I still kinda miss you two.  
Ah yeah—Bee, Dino—d’you guys know how I even landed a room like this?? I’m on the *staff/professor* side. This place is *premium*. 👀

There was a pause. And then—

**Bee**:  
YOU GOT *WHAT*!!!?  
omg I better get the same kind of room like you or I’ll *set fire to that spire place* 🔥🔥🔥  
(*while a bit jealous, but cackling and smiling along*)

**Dino**:  
Surprise ya, Dwarf. 😏  
Hope you like being near Bee and me.

**Bee**:  
Near you??  
Wait—Damien. *How* did you even manage to get him there???

**Dino**:  
Not saying. It’s a surprise.  
Also—it’s *US*, not only Cael 😌

**Cael**:  
Of course it is. *sigh*  
Anyways—thanks, Damian. I really love this place. 👍

**Dino**:  
No worries, kid. I still gotta show I’m your *older* brother after all.

**Bee**:  
Not fair, I’m also older than Cally 😤

**Dino**:  
Still younger *and* smaller than me, Bee 😎

**Cael**:  
HAHAH—  
Okay, then I guess I’ll have to stay as the youngest and most spoiled brat in this side of the galaxy?

**Bee**:  
You better. There’s *no one* that can top my *“little Cally”* 💋✨

**Cael**:  
*Groans*  
Really, Bee? *Little Cally*?

**Bee**:  
Yup 😌.  
Welp, I better go out now. Gotta have my beauty sleep—  
I don’t stay this cute just by working and drinking tea. ☕✨  
See ya later, guys\~

**Cael**:  
Bye Bee. Love ya. Take care

**Dino**:  
Later Beatrice. Sleep tight.

**Cael**:  
Alright, my turn to catch some ZZZ's too.  
Talk ya later, Dino. Sleep tight, man.

**Dino**:  
Talk ya later, Rowy.  
Take care, be careful, and have a nice rest.

Cael sat there for a few quiet moments after the chat closed. Still. Warm. Full.

He let the Bracelink screen fade, stood up, and stretched until his joints popped.

A long shower followed. Hot water, steam rising like breath from a dragon’s mouth. He scrubbed off the grime of moving, let the scent of mint and cedar settle into his skin. Brushed his teeth. Washed his face. Ran a towel through his hair with the laziness of someone finally *home*.

The lights dimmed automatically as he stepped into his bedroom.

He slipped under the covers. Bee’s oversized mattress cocooned him like it had been designed for three of him. The mural on the wall glowed faint under the ambient light—golden port skies in frozen time.

He smiled, eyes already half-shut.

In the stillness, the echo of Dino’s laugh and Bee’s teasing lingered like ghosts made of comfort.

“Night,” he whispered.

The room didn’t answer.

But it didn’t need to.

I’ve started to look my room because she kept stealing my money, eat all my food, hide my jewellery and perfume in her bags and much more. 

But I can’t keep things in there that need to be kept in the fridge, so the problem is still there. Chocolate that I put in there so it isn’t melty all over my shelves? It’s gone not even an hour. Red bull I like to drink because it gives me energy study? None of it is in the fridge anymore after a day.

I recently got from a students fair two limited edition drinks (it was the Emmi cookies and cream milk-coffee, and they haven’t sold that for over a year now.) I of course had to keep those in the fridge or they would have gone bad, but both disappeared!! I wanted to share it with my family but now we couldn’t even try it because she selfishly drank it all.

She always had issues with stealing and has even been caught by cops for it a couple times, but she wasn’t 16 then so she couldn’t go to jail for it. Now she hasn’t done it outside anymore, but at home it still hasn’t stopped! I keep arguing about my father about this and he has told me to just get a mini fridge and keep that in my room. 
But:
1. A good mini fridge here costs at least a hundred bucks and just as much as I don’t want to spend any money on it, he refuses to do the same. 
2. It’s a waste of space when all I will be keeping in there will be a couple items of food.
3. It’s also a waste of space and I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep well with the noises it’ll make. 

I just want her to stop stealing my stuff, but it feels like she never will. I don’t know what to do, because talking to her does absolutely nothing.",1,1744937156.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

The doctors in Canada are stumped. Perhaps there's a parasite or insect that caused my symptoms? Here are the details:

1) I visited Brazil in November 2024. Ilhabela specifically. Beautiful place! Lovely people :).

2) On my second day, I became violently ill for a few hours in the middle of the night and then my throat felt like I had swallowed peppermint essential oil (a cooling/burning feeling). Then my tongue felt like someone had spilled hot coffee on it. 

3) These symptoms have continued for half a year, 24-7. I have had every bodily fluid tested more than once. I've tried acid-blockers, anti-fungal meds, an elimination diet, avoiding acidic foods, avoiding sugar, a three day bone-broth fast, and every supplement you can think of. My throat has been scoped by an ENT. Nothing shows up.

4) Do my symptoms sound familiar to anyone? I'm at the point where I wonder if an insect crawled inside my mouth lol. I know that sounds crazy, but it's a complete mystery.

So I’ve worked for a licensed store for 6 years. 2 of those years as a ssv and 3 years as store manager. I’m a coffee master and worked for one of the busiest stores in North America. This is all clearly highlighter on my resume because it’s a lot to be proud of and what I want to showcase to any store I may go to.

I recently moved states to be closer to family and because where I was living was just honestly getting out of my price range for acceptable. I knew I wouldn’t be able to do a clean transfer because I didn’t work for a corporate store, but I took my chances and just applied to be a store manager at other locations anyway. I had SIX interviews for a SM position, and then eventually chose to go in another direction. (Also I feel like having 6 interviews and not hiring someone after that is a CRIME but that’s another story for another day). So, pretty defeated I was like ok. I love working here so why don’t I apply for another store as a shift lead. 

I feel like I’m overly qualified to be a shift lead due to my experience. Eventually all I heard back was my application expired. So I was like ok oh well. 

WELLLLL turns out because I have a few friends on the inside of this store the manager showed EVERYONE my resume and was going to call and give me an interview because I was qualified and had a great resume. But he was stuck between me and his daughter who had NO starbucks experience. And looking at the title we can all assume who got the position…. His untrained daughter :) how you’re gonna have a ssv with no experience is beyond me but ok!!


So here I am unemployed and giving up on working at the bucks again. I feel like the last 6 years have gone to waste as I really wanted to be a DM one day. I understand I took the risk to quit and move on but to find out I missed out on my in because of “nepotism” is a little wild. I thought once I got in to a corporate store my chance of scoring a SM interview in a couple years I had a better chance with and might be a better fit than I am now. 

So what would you do? Find the dm and slip a message to them? lol this just seems a little unfair. I’ll get over it, but I can only imagine how unfair it is for the employees currently working there. ",5,1744937008.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best wooden serving trays combine durability, aesthetic appeal, and practical functionality. These features ensure that the trays are not only beautiful but also reliable and easy to use.

**Material Quality:** High-quality wooden serving trays are typically crafted from durable hardwoods like acacia, bamboo, maple, or walnut. These woods are known for their strength, resistance to warping, and attractive grain patterns. The use of solid wood ensures longevity and stability, making the tray suitable for carrying heavy items without bending or cracking. The finish should be food-safe and resistant to scratches and stains, maintaining the tray's appearance over time.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The design of a wooden serving tray significantly impacts its visual appeal and how well it complements different d茅cor styles. Trays come in various shapes, including rectangular, round, square, and oval, each offering a unique aesthetic. Features like raised edges, handles, and decorative inlays add to the tray's functionality and visual interest. A well-designed tray should be both stylish and practical, enhancing the presentation of food and drinks.

**Size and Dimensions:** The size of the serving tray should be appropriate for its intended use. Larger trays are ideal for serving multiple dishes or drinks at once, while smaller trays are better suited for individual servings or appetizers. Consider the dimensions of your dining table or countertop to ensure the tray fits comfortably without taking up too much space. The depth of the tray is also important, especially for preventing spills and keeping items secure during transport.

**Handles and Grip:** Sturdy and well-placed handles are essential for comfortable and safe carrying. Handles should be ergonomically designed to provide a secure grip, even when the tray is fully loaded. Options include cut-out handles, metal handles, and wooden handles, each offering a different level of comfort and style. The handles should be securely attached to the tray to prevent breakage and ensure stability.

**Finish and Maintenance:** The finish of a wooden serving tray not only enhances its appearance but also protects the wood from moisture and stains. Food-safe finishes like natural oils, varnishes, and lacquers are commonly used, providing a smooth and durable surface. The finish should be easy to clean and maintain, requiring only a damp cloth to wipe away spills and crumbs. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the finish and the wood.

**Weight Capacity:** A good wooden serving tray should be able to handle a reasonable amount of weight without bending or wobbling. The weight capacity depends on the type of wood used, the thickness of the tray, and the strength of the handles. Consider the types of items you'll be serving on the tray and choose a model with sufficient weight capacity to avoid accidents and ensure safe transport.

Wooden serving trays offer several practical benefits, making them a valuable addition to any home or restaurant. These benefits include enhanced presentation, improved convenience, and long-term durability.

**Enhanced Presentation:** Wooden serving trays elevate the presentation of food and drinks, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication to any occasion. The natural warmth and beauty of the wood create a visually appealing backdrop for showcasing culinary creations. Whether you're serving appetizers, desserts, or cocktails, a wooden tray enhances the overall dining experience and impresses guests with its stylish presentation.

**Improved Convenience:** Using a wooden serving tray simplifies the task of transporting multiple items at once, saving time and effort. The tray provides a stable and secure surface for carrying dishes, glasses, and utensils, reducing the risk of spills and accidents. This is particularly useful when serving guests outdoors, transporting food from the kitchen to the dining room, or enjoying breakfast in bed.

**Long-Term Durability:** High-quality wooden serving trays are built to last, providing years of reliable service with proper care. Durable hardwoods like acacia, bamboo, and maple are resistant to warping, cracking, and staining, ensuring that the tray maintains its appearance and functionality over time. Investing in a well-made wooden tray is a cost-effective choice, as it eliminates the need for frequent replacements and provides lasting value.

**Versatile Functionality:** Wooden serving trays are versatile tools that can be used for a variety of purposes beyond serving food and drinks. They can be used to organize items on a coffee table, display decorative objects, or even serve as a lap desk for working or reading. This versatility makes wooden trays a practical and adaptable addition to any home.

**Eco-Friendly Choice:** Many wooden serving trays are made from sustainable and renewable resources, making them an environmentally friendly choice. Bamboo, for example, is a fast-growing grass that can be harvested without harming the environment.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about wooden serving trays to help you make an informed purchase.

**What types of wood are best for serving trays?**
  The best types of wood for serving trays include acacia, bamboo, maple, walnut, and cherry. These woods are known for their durability, strength, and resistance to warping. They also have attractive grain patterns that enhance the tray's aesthetic appeal. Acacia and bamboo are particularly popular for their sustainability and fast growth.

**How do I clean and maintain a wooden serving tray?**
  To clean a wooden serving tray, wipe it down with a damp cloth after each use. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they can damage the finish and the wood. For stubborn stains, use a mild dish soap diluted with water. After cleaning, dry the tray thoroughly with a soft towel. To maintain the tray's appearance, occasionally apply a food-safe oil or wax to protect the wood from moisture and prevent it from drying out.

**Are wooden serving trays food-safe?**
  Yes, wooden serving trays are food-safe as long as they are finished with a food-safe coating. Common food-safe finishes include natural oils, varnishes, and lacquers. These finishes create a barrier between the wood and the food, preventing contamination. Always check the product label to ensure that the serving tray is certified as food-safe before using it to serve food.

**Can wooden serving trays be used outdoors?**
  Wooden serving trays can be used outdoors, but it's important to protect them from the elements. Avoid leaving the tray in direct sunlight or rain, as this can cause the wood to warp or crack. When using the tray outdoors, wipe it down with a dry cloth after each use to remove any moisture. Store the tray indoors when not in use to prolong its lifespan.

1k1s3qg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k1s3qg/the_red_file/,THE RED FILE,"This is my first time on sub and the story is written by me.

So here, you go-

The Red File

Dhiraj was only supposed to clean out the storage room.

His first week at the law firm had been uneventful—fetching coffee, making copies, and attending meetings he wasn’t invited to speak in. So when the senior partner, Mrs. Kapoor, tossed him a ring of old keys and pointed to the locked basement door, he thought nothing of it. “Clear it out,” she said. “Burn what’s outdated. Don’t touch the red file.”

That should’ve been a red flag.

But curiosity always itched in Dhiraj’s bones.

The basement was dark, cold, and filled with stacks of dusty files. Shelves groaned under the weight of boxes, each one sealed tight with thick tape, their labels nearly illegible from years of neglect. It smelled like old paper and something faintly metallic, like iron left out in the rain. The air felt dense, like the room had secrets it didn’t want to share.

Dhiraj didn’t mind. He was used to cleaning up other people's messes.

He dragged a cart along the concrete floor, shifting box after box into the flickering light. His eyes scanned through the piles, his mind already halfway out the door. But then, tucked in a corner, something caught his attention.

A red folder, standing out against the sea of yellowing manila. It was so… vibrant. So intentionally out of place.

The red file.

He could hear Mrs. Kapoor’s voice in his head: Don’t touch it.

But curiosity had already sunk its teeth into him.

He pulled it from the shelf. The paper was stiff, like it hadn’t been touched in years, and it crackled as he opened it. Inside were a series of documents—contracts, briefings, photos. The names were familiar. High-profile clients the firm had represented. But there was something strange about the case number written in the corner of each page: X13/11.

Dhiraj flipped through the papers, his fingers tingling. As he reached the last page, two black-and-white photos slipped out—grainy but clear.

The first was a picture of a man, standing in front of a sleek, modern building. He looked ordinary—just a businessman. The second photo was of the same man, but now, his face was smeared, unrecognizable, as if someone had deliberately blurred it out. At the bottom of the photo was a note: “Never speak to him again.”

Dhiraj’s heart skipped a beat. Something didn’t sit right. This wasn’t a typical legal case file. This was personal.

He was about to shut the file when his phone buzzed, breaking his concentration. It was a message from Mrs. Kapoor:

“I see you’ve found it. Leave it alone.”

His fingers froze on the screen. How did she know?

A loud bang came from upstairs, followed by the sharp screech of a door opening. Dhiraj’s breath caught in his throat. The building was empty. He hadn’t heard anyone else around for hours.

“Hello?” His voice echoed in the basement, but no answer came.

He closed the red file and shoved it back into the box, trying to shake off the unease that was gnawing at him. As he moved to leave, the basement door creaked open, and Mrs. Kapoor appeared at the top of the stairs.

Her eyes locked on his, cold and unblinking.

“You shouldn’t have opened it,” she said, her voice low. “Do you know what you’ve done?”

Dhiraj’s pulse quickened. “I—I didn’t know. I just… I found it.”

She stepped closer, the air around her growing heavy. “You’ve triggered something you can’t undo. You have no idea what this file represents. What it’s tied to.”

“What is it? What’s going on?” Dhiraj asked, his voice shaking.

Mrs. Kapoor didn’t answer. Instead, she reached into her bag, pulling out a small, old-fashioned key. She handed it to him, her fingers brushing his briefly.

“Take this,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “You’ll need it.”

Dhiraj took it instinctively, confused, but the moment the cold metal touched his palm, a strange sense of dread washed over him. The basement door slammed shut behind him, and the lights flickered once more.

“Do you hear that?” Mrs. Kapoor asked, her eyes never leaving his.

Dhiraj strained to listen. Faintly, almost like a whisper in the walls, came a voice—soft, yet distinct: “You shouldn’t have come here. You shouldn’t have opened the file.”

The words sent a chill down his spine. He looked back at Mrs. Kapoor, but she was gone.

The basement was silent again.

Shaking, Dhiraj rushed to the door. As he turned the key, he found it stuck, as if someone on the other side was holding it shut. The whispers grew louder, more frantic.

“Leave... NOW...”

With a burst of adrenaline, Dhiraj yanked the door open, rushing out into the dark hallway. The firm was quiet—too quiet. No one else was around.

But the whispers didn’t stop.

That night, as he lay in bed, exhausted and trembling, the buzzing of his phone woke him up. It was a new message from Mrs. Kapoor:

“I told you to leave it alone. It’s too late now. They’re coming for you.”

The next morning, Dhiraj arrived at the office to find it deserted. The lights flickered, and the building had an eerie, abandoned feel to it—despite the fact that it was only 9 AM.

He walked to the basement, the key still in his pocket. He felt its weight, like an anchor, pulling him back to the room he had just left.

But when he opened the door to the storage room, the red file was gone.

And in its place? A new file, marked with his name on the top in thick, black ink.

He flipped it open. The pages were full of familiar names, cases, and photos. But the last photo made his blood run cold. It was a picture of him, taken from behind. The same blurred, smeared effect on his face, just like the man in the earlier photo.

At the bottom of the page was a note: “Now you’re one of us.”

His fingers trembled as he looked around the room. He felt something watching him.

He reached into his pocket to pull out the key—only to find it was gone.",0,1744936300.0,nosleep,1,0.5,False
1k1s338,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1k1s338/ltheanine_is_helping_calm_down_my_nervous_system/,L-theanine is helping calm down my nervous system.,"Hi, I have PTSD from a certain event that happened in my childhood and CPTSD from other things, both from consequences surrounding that event and other childhood/teenager, even adult abuse and trauma.

In my teenage years it was also speculated I may have had bipolar as well (all these things interconnect in my experience-- bipolar, ADHD, mood disorders, certain brain malfunctions, inflammation), and I have over the years had some symptoms of that as well.

It's been rough. It's been isolating and lonely, and I'm sure I don't have to tell you guys all about that.

It's caused me to have massive amounts of crippling anxiety, agoraphobia, insomnia, paranoia, eating disorders, mood, and emotional issues. My whole body has been dealing with inflammation since I was a teenager, and I've been sick on and off in different ways for a long time. It's messed with my hormones and whatever else you can imagine. 

Some things have waxed and waned over the years, but I'm not going to get into all of that because that's not the point of this post. 

Anyway, I have had unimaginable stress and tension in my body even when I am not aware of it, as well as very strong uncomfortable feelings IN my body, like rage and anger and other things, that were really terrible to feel and caused very bad reactions at times (self harm, etc).

It was uncomfortable at times being in my body, and at other times, it was like I was totally disconnected from it. It was like my mind body connection was totally disintegrated in one way or the other.

Anyway, I've started messing around with an almino acid called L theanine.... 

What it's doing for me is unbelievable and incredible.

I don't know how else to describe it other than I'm getting ""Buddhist level"" awareness and calmness from this compound. My body feels amazing ... I had tension in my stomach that I didn't even know I had until I started taking this. 
How do I know? Because my body is no longer tense ... and I didn't even know that it was like that.

My mind feels clear. I'm no longer on edge. My emotions are still there, but they're much easier to process and handle and recognize. Pay reverence to and acknowledge that they're there ... but not necessarily overly identify with them. Which is amazing, I've never had that before (although I am aware of the concept cognitively).

There are other things too, like my hair stopped falling out, and my skin feels softer. Tension in my neck is gone... and when I first started taking this (maybe over a week ago), I felt the knots in my back, but they felt good.. like they were releasing. Like I was getting a very long, prolonged massage, or being in a nice hot bath with epsom salt. My eyesight is clearer ... My stomach feels amazing (it turns out L-theanine helps with gut health). I'm able to digest food better, it feels like. My skin looks like it's clearing up (I have a bit of rosacea, which sprang up a few years ago).

I'm able to articulate myself better without getting nervous .. I actually haven't been getting nervous much at all. Things that would set me on edge? They don't. It's interesting how many things I blew out of proportion.

Ok, but here's the BEST part, ok!! 

So the one very bad traumatic event from my childhood (the thing that gave me what they call ""military ptsd,"" even though I've never been in the military), I don't really like to talk about it, but it involved other people as well, so sometimes it does come up. That and the surrounding events around that.

Normally, whenever it does, which is rare, but whenever it does, my somatic nervous system is triggered, and I begin to shake and tremble. All to varying degrees, depending on how the topic hits... Not even full bars of xanax can help me sometimes (that's actually happened, where I could not stop shaking and trembling, even though I took two full bars ... with NO tolerance!!).

Well, that conversation was thrust on me against my will, maybe four or five days into my journey with L-theanine... and I did not get that reaction. Which is.. wow. My body and my muscles did begin to tense and untense during the conversation, but in a very, very, very slow way, which has never happened before. I did feel my feelings, which was uncomfortability, but it wasn't as catastrophic as it could be ... Nothing is. Nothing seems to be anymore. I was able to set boundaries and tell the other person calmly that the topic makes me uncomfortable and that I will hang up if they continue. 

Then, even today, another horrific aspect of the topic was brought up again by someone else, and I was able to articulate myself about it without getting stressed or tense or upset ... and that's never happened in my life. 

I'm observing all of this from the outside in, and it's very interesting.

I just love how untense my body is and how my jaw and my tongue are no longer tense and how good I feel. How good my mind feels. How calm I am. Other people are responding great around me, too... that's because my mind is different. And I've been laughing and smiling a lot more. Very happy and content and very in the moment. My emotional well-being has skyrocketed ... and so has my productivity, as I'm just doing things instead of thinking about them for a million years first, unable to move. My body feels AMAZING!! 

And my anxiety is gone. My neuroticism- gone.

It's made my sleep quality so much better, too. I feel so much more rested. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share this in this group because I know some people in here probably struggle with some or all of this too, and maybe it could help you. I take way over the recommended dose, and... I think brand is everything. So get a very pure brand with not a lot of filler (like crowd source and do your research, and if you want, I can recommend you some that I'm taking).

Also, look into suntheanine versus l-theanine because suntheanine converts into l-theanine, and I don't know why, but some people think it's better. 

Here's a little bit more information:
L-theanine effects gaba apparently, which is probably low in some people who have high levels of glutamate in their brain and gut biome (usually people who have ptsd, ibs, etc, have high amounts of glutamate in their system I think... which can cause mood disorders like bpd, and bipolar, etc). This helps lower glutamate or at least level it out is what I've read.

Anyway, I am not a physicist, but I do know what this is doing for me. It is changing my life personally.

I don't think this is the be-all and end-all for me, as this healing and integrating thing is a journey (I've been on it for a while and have done various things holistically with varying levels of success).. But it's definitely a fucking great step to take and it's something I'm very happy I'm taking. My mood is elevated in a healthy way and I feel great. 

If you look into studies researchers have done with cognitive function, neuropathways, memory, and the brain in regards to L-theanine, it's just a plus all around. It apparently also helps with people who have TBI as well.

Anyways, stay blessed people ✌️ and we're all on this journey together. 

PS if you are taking antidepressants you may want to look into l-theanine and contraindications and ask your doctor. I am not a doctor, and this is not medical advice, this is just one person reporting their experience. Also healthy fatty foods are really really good with L-theanine. And also, so is coffee. Caffeine and L-theanine makes a super compound that helps with enhanced concentration, energy, and focus .. without the jitters and the anxiousness.

1k1rvgg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1rvgg,2003 YongPinHao “Yi Wu - Ye Sheng”,"7g/100 mL, just off boil

Dry leaves - faint aroma of hay and pencil shavings

Wash (5s) - leathery aroma

Steep 1 (flash) - honey-sweetened oatmeal aroma, paper, leather, pencil shavings, cocoa, skim milk, oats, sweetness at back of throat

Steep 2 (5s) - intriguing sweetness in the nose building on previous Steep, earthy on the palate, bitterness around mouth and back of throat rather than tip of tongue, fades to creaminess, lots of aromatics dancing after swallow, hard to pin any down, maybe buckwheat honey/coffee/cacao nibs, with mint leaves and bamboo shoots?, sweetness spreading around palate at end

Steep 3 (20s) - decided to push it a little early, aroma less sweet and more milky, tastes like I have cream in here, faint bitter/earthy, fleeting espresso bitterness on tip of tongue fades to cooling, finish is tres leches cake, 

Steep 4 (30s) - moving towards aged shou mei a bit, sweet honey and cinnamon after espresso/cacao bitterness fades, creaminess still present but fading into balance rather than lead note

Steep 5 (45s) - getting hints of aged, oaked red wine with an open-mouthed slurp, this is probably part of the aromatics I couldn't pin down early on, coffee and cream still strong, all elements fading a bit, but in unison, some dried fruit on fifish. Cha qi hitting in body. Time to break for some yard work.

Steep 6 (reboil, 1 min) - musty basement,  wet paper, topsoil, slight menthol note, banana peel, almond skin, flavors fading

Steep 7 ( 2+ min) - vanilla cream on nose, French vanilla coffee with cream on palate, along with leather-bound books and fleeting medicinal bitterness that fades quickly

Steep 8 (8 min) - light coffee and cream character paired with leather and pencil shavings 

Final thoughts - great complexity and depth of flavor here. Really distinct creaminess that plays well off of coffee and sweet notes. Very interesting aged sheng. Not really my favorite, but only out of personal preference. If this flavor profile interests you I'd definitely give it a go.

1k1rv3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/amipregnant/comments/1k1rv3j/helppp/,helppp,"Hi everyonee! 

My period just returned after a 4-month long absence. It lasted for 5 days, medium flow, deep red in color and with clots. After my period ended, my nipples BECAME SORE, until now.. Then, after my period ended, I peed an egg-white like discharge. Then, just this night, I peed and noticed in my liners a small chunky yellowish discharge, it was sticky too but no smell and on my pee there's a small egg-white discharge again. Im having pain in my lower back, left side of my abdomen and sometimes just below the ribs, and I'm having a diarrhea (maybe because i drank iced coffee). My flo app says I'm ovulating in 2 days. I'm just new to the app, I downloaded it just to see how many days I am delayed before my period returned, and I know not to rely on the app.

 Is it possible that my ovulation is on the way? I don't have access to ovulation strips. And I know because of my irregularities it's hard to pinpoint my exact ovulation. 

Im just stressing because I just had a period last week and im cramping here real bad. and, I had unprotected sex just months ago but I got a period after that sex, so I'm having anxiety and pregnancy scares, and im still indenial even though i got a period after that and my period returned after a long absence. because of the videos and stories I've seen on TikTok. 😅

Although there are perks such as not being bothered by things that people say stink, there was a gas leak at my work and I was none the wiser until someone told me that I had to evacuate. (And yes everyone but me could smell the gas).

Episode 2: Not So Happy Campers - Part 2

""Last time, on Total Drama Island! Twenty-two campers have signed up to spend eight weeks right here at this crummy old summer camp, then have to face the judgment of their fellow campers.""

""This is our first challenge, how hard can it be?"" The clip of Rodney eating with his team was shown, followed by a switch to the cliff.

""Oh, (BLEEP)!""

(Theme Song)

[Several shots of the lights and cameras hidden around camp popping out and turning on, often at the expense of the wildlife. A cue card marks a transition to a fly-by shot starting at the docks and 'Wawanakwa' sign, past the camp facilities, and over the top of the host drinking coffee in a director's chair just as the lyrics start.]

Dear Mom and Dad, I'm doing fine;

[The camera flies through the trees and up to the largest cliff, peeking over to see two rings of buoys laid out in the water.]

You guys are on my mind!

[The camera dives off the cliff and into an underwater shot; Owen swims through the water in his swimsuit and farts. The gas blows behind him and kills a fish.]

You asked me what I wanted to be,

And now I think the answer is plain to see!

[A cut to the surface, where Brick and Dawn are sitting on a surfboard and looking at each other. The fish surfaces, allowing for an eagle to come pick it up.]

I wanna be...famous!

[The eagle and fish hang in front of the sun for a moment before the eagle drops the fish into the woods. The camera pans down to Rodney sitting on a stump and looking at pictures admiringly; the fish hits him in the head, knocking him over. The camera zooms out to show Duncan watching the scene and laughing, and then again to show Courtney upset with Duncan.]

I wanna live close to the sun!

[The camera zooms to another part of camp, showing Heather and Jo fighting in a canoe and don't notice the waterfall until they fall over the edge.]

Well pack your bags, 'cause I've already won!

[The shot pans down to the bottom of the waterfall, showing Harold standing on a broken log suspended between two rocks. He is seen practicing martial arts moves while Heather and Jo fall behind him. Shawn, feeling panicked, comes into view by swinging on a vine and collides with Harold, sending both flying off to the left of the camera.]

Everything to prove, nothing in my way;

[The camera rapidly pans to follow Harold and Shawn, and they eventually slam into the outhouse confessional. The impact causes Lindsay to fly out the door, and the camera pans over to the Main Lodge – Chef's silhouette is visible in the window.]

I'll get there one day.

[The camera moves in past the window to show a smirking Chef, arm deep in a large pot of something sickly green. He looks behind him to where Ezekiel and Noah are sitting, both tied up. The two share a nervous glance.]

'Cause I wanna be...famous!

[The camera pans left to show Eva and Sky arm wrestling until Eva beats Sky. The camera zooms out past another window to show the edge of the docks. Katie and Sadie are sitting and admiring someone off-camera.]

(Na-na nanananaa, nanana-nanaa, na-nananananaa)

[A pan down the docks shows Lightning flexing and kissing both of his muscles. The camera pans right to show a seagull, with a fragment of net wrapped around its neck, sitting on the water as a shark jumps over it and eats a trout in mid-air. The seagull appears to be safe until a mysterious tentacle grabs it, and pulls it under the water.]

I wanna be! I wanna be! I wanna be famous! (Na-na nanananaa, nanana-nanaa, na-nananananaa)

I wanna be! I wanna be! I wanna be famous! (Na-na nanananaa, nanana-nanaa, na-nananananaa)

[The camera moves to Beth waving at the camera and taking some steps back. She twirls a flaming baton while passing it back and forth between her hands, then tosses it in the air. The camera follows the baton as day turns into night. The scene pans down to reveal Ella and Mike sitting at a campfire in front of a large full moon. They lean in for a kiss but are interrupted by Cody's sudden appearance between them, an arm around both of them and an goofy smile. The shot zooms out to show the other campers also sitting around the fire and whistling the last few notes of the theme song as Chris watches.]

The episode resumes with the campers on the cliff. ""Okay!"" Chris said next to a crate. ""Today's challenge is threefold! Your first task is to jump off this one-thousand-foot high cliff, into the lake.""

""Easy enough,"" Jo said with a smirk.

""If you look down, you will see two target areas,"" Chris continued. ""The wider area represents the part of the lake that we have stocked with psychotic,"" he laughed as a shark jumped out of the water, ""man-eating sharks! Inside that area is a safe zone. That's your target area, which we're pretty sure is shark-free!""

""Shark-free?"" Shawn asked.

""For each member of your team that jumps and actually...survives, there will be a crate of supplies waiting below,"" Chris presented the two stacks of crates on the beach. ""Inside each crate are supplies that you'll need for the second part of the challenge...building a hot tub!

""The team with the best one gets to have a wicked hot tub party tonight!"" the host continued. ""The losers will be sending someone home. Let's see… Killer Bass! You're up first!""

Shawn looked down at the water. ""Oh man, that's a long drop! So, uh, who wants to go first?”

As expected, nobody volunteered and just stayed still.

""Hey, don't sweat it guys!"" Owen said. ""I heard that these shows always make the interns do the stunt first, to make sure it's survivable.""

The footage cut to Chris and Chef at the top of the cliff, the latter wearing his swimsuit. ""We need to test the stunts first!"" Chris exclaimed. ""You know that!""

""Do I look like an intern?"" Chef asked.

""No,"" Chris replied, ""but the ones we had are all in the hospital. Come on. Just jump it, you big chicken!"" He made a few clucking noises.

""I don't get paid enough for this man,"" Chef said, snapping his swim goggles over his eyes. He jumped off the cliff and screamed all the way down.

Chef landed in the water and surfaced. ""Hey! I made it!"" he said. ""I made it man!"" He then felt something underwater. ""Something just brushed by my foot!"" he looked around while a shark fin swam behind. ""Hey Chris, man! Somethin' ain't right down here!""

He sank below the water before jumping out of it, screaming and running away from the shark.

Chris wrote something on a clipboard. ""Well! That seems safe enough,"" he concluded and walked away.

The footage was back to the present. ""So, who’s up?” Eva asked her teammates.

""Ladies first,"" Duncan told the muscle woman.

""I'll jump,"" Shawn stepped up. ""All we have to do is time it right and make it to the safe zone.""

He jumped off the cliff and landed in the inner circle. He surfaced and smiled at his team while a boat came to pick him up.

Mike was shown gulping as he looked down. ""Okay Mike. It's just an insane cliff dive into shark infested waters. You can do this, c'mon.""

He then suddenly inhaled. ""Wrong! Only vone person can do dis!” he declared in a fairly good Russian accent, his voice taking on a feminine aspect to accompany what almost looked like fuller lips and longer eyelashes as he began tiptoeing forward. “Svetlana, ze Olympic queen of gymnastics!”

Svetlana then did a backflip before landing in the safe zone. Afterwards, Svetlana inhaled into Mike, who was looking confused. ""How did I get here?""

Confessional: Mike

""Okay, okay. I admit it. I... I have Dissociative Identity Disorder,"" Mike told the confessional camera. ""I try to control them, but they never listen to me. I auditioned for this show to prove I'm more than just my disorder. I don't know how I'm going to tell my teammates.""

Confessional Ends

A series of campers jumping started. Ella came first, cheering the whole way down. Eva followed shortly, screaming ""Look out below!"" Duncan was next, silently falling with his arms crossed.

Back at the clifftop, Rodney was next in line but looked worried. ""I'm not jumping,"" he said.

""Why not?"" Chris asked.

""That water is filled with sharks,"" Rodney said. ""I don't do well around them, and one of my uncles died because of a shark.""

""That's okay, man,"" Chris seemingly comforted him. ""Unfortunately, that also makes you a chicken."" He placed a chicken hat on top of the country boy's head. ""So, you'll have to wear this for the rest of the day.""

""It's just a hat,"" Rodney said. ""I can handle it.""

Chris made chicken noises in order to tease Rodney. ""That means the chicken's path down is that-a-way,"" he showed an escalator somehow attached to the cliff, and Rodney walked down on it. ""Next?”

""YEE-HAW!"" Ezekiel cheered and jumped off, hitting a protruding rock halfway down which sent him spinning yet landing perfectly in the center ring. The scene cut to his teammates cheering on the beach, then him giving a thumbs up in response.

""Yes!"" Harold called out before his jump. He yelled in glee the whole trip down before he groaned in pain. Birds flew away, and various campers and even the sharks cringed as the dweeb sank into the water holding his groin.

""Oh, hate to see that happen,"" Chris said from the top of the cliff, Courtney right next to him.

""Excuse me Chris, I have a medical condition,"" Courtney said.

""What condition?"" Chris asked.

""A condition that prevents me from jumping off cliffs,"" Courtney said.

“You can chicken out if you want, but it might end up costing your team the win... and then they'll hate you,” Chris reminded.

“It's a calculated risk. I've seen the other team, and I don't think nine of them will jump,” Courtney assumed while looking at the Gophers.

“Alright, here is your chicken hat,” Chris placed the hat on Courtney's head.

Chris then held up a clipboard and checked the progress. ""So, let's tally up the results. Hold on, that's seven jumpers and two chickens. We're missing two.""

Sadie and Katie were holding each other's hand while Dawn watched them. ""I'm not jumping without Katie!"" Sadie declared.

""We have to be on the same team, Chris!"" Katie begged. ""Please!""

Katie and Sadie stood in front of Chris and began to plead over and over. ""Please! Can we? Can we, can we, Chris? Can we, can we, can we?!""

""I'll switch places with her,"" Dawn spoke up.

""Alright, fine!"" Chris said in exasperation. ""You're both on the Killer Bass now. Dawn, you're on the Screaming Gophers.""

""Yes!"" The BFFFLs cheered and Dawn went over to her new team.

""That means you're up, girls!"" Chris told Katie and Sadie.

Katie and Sadie held each other's hand and ran down the cliff. ""We're coming, Killer Bass!"" They shouted to the team and jumped into the safe zone.

Chris observed the score. ""Okay. So that's nine jumpers and two chickens."" He turned around to look at the other team. ""Screaming Gophers! If you can beat that, we'll throw in a pull cart to put your crates on!""

""Great,"" Brick focused on his team. ""So, who's up first?”

The Gophers were silent until Heather broke the silence. “I'm sorry. There is no way I'm doing this.”

""Why not?"" Beth asked.

""Hello, national TV?"" Heather replied. ""I'll get my hair wet.""

""You gotta be kidding, right?"" Jo asked in disbelief.

“If she's not doing it, I'm not doing it,” Lindsay spoke up, and the two girls smiled at each other.

Jo stepped up to Heather. ""You're jumping, Queenie!"" she fiercely told the queen bee. “No way are we losing because of your hair day!”

""Make me!"" Heather dared Jo, prompting the jock-ette to pick her up and throw her off the cliff. She screamed all the way down, successfully landing in the target zone. As she resurfaced, she looked up threateningly. ""Jo, you are so dead!""

""Tell me something I don't hear everyday!"" Jo yelled back. ""Now I just have to hit the safe zone as well.""

Jo jumped, screaming all the way down, and landed in the safe zone next to an angry Heather.

""I thought this was going to be a talent contest,"" Lindsay told Chris fearfully.

Chris laughed. ""Yeah, no!""

Once again, a series of jumping contestants started to play. Lindsay was screaming her lungs out, Sky was also yelping as well, Cody was hollering, Lightning was in a cannonball position doing a front flip, and Noah fell quietly and with a bored expression.

Dawn dived into the water next, but she missed the safe zone. The sharks swam towards her, and her teammates warned her to get away.

""Oh, um, yes, I don't suppose you'd like to help me get to shore?"" Dawn asked the sharks, backing away in fear. The three fish actually stopped to look at each other for a moment before resuming their approach. ""Right, yes, just checking!"" Dawn said, hurrying to the 'safe' area and the waiting ship.

Meanwhile, Beth was looking down at the water. ""I... I can't do it. I'm too scared."" Chris pulls out another chicken hat. ""I'm sorry!""

On the boat, Cody and Lightning were making chicken noises at Beth's failure.

""That is like, so lame, right?"" Lindsay looked back at Heather.

""Fully lame!"" Heather responded.

""Let's do this!"" Brick told Owen and jumped off the cliff, perfectly landing in the safe zone.

Chris held up a megaphone. ""Okay, campers! There's only one person left!"" he talked about Owen. ""You guys need this jump for the win!"" He turned to Owen and said ""No pressure, dude!"" Owen smiled confidently until the host added ""Okay, there's pressure!""

Down below, the Screaming Gophers were encouraging and giving Owen support to jump into the water. ""Just do it Owen! Do it!"" Heather shouted.

Confessional: Owen

""Oh, I was pretty darn nervous,"" Owen confessed. ""See the thing is, I'm not that strong a swimmer.""

Confessional: Shawn

""Yeah, I don't think he's gonna jump,"" Shawn said point blank.

Confessional: Jo

""If he goes through with this, he's probably dead,"" Jo guessed.

Confessionals End

The camera cut back to Chris and Owen at the clifftop. ""Take a good run at it buddy,"" Chris coached. ""You can do this!""

Owen walked away from the camera. ""I'm going to die now. I'm going to freaking die now,"" he lamented. The other nine members of the Screaming Gophers who'd already jumped were shown on the beach, looking up at Owen in anticipation and fear. Owen's fist was shown being clenched, before a few members of the Killer Bass were shown in profile, looking up as well.

A shot of Owen's eyes narrowing, then back to Brick on the beach. ""You've got this, soldier!"" he called up to his teammate.

Owen charged past Chris and straight off the cliff, the tone of his screams changing rapidly from determination to utter fear as he yelled “OH CRAP!” Various angles of his fall were shown, and he finally belly flopped into the water, creating a huge splash that wiped everybody out, including the sharks.

Moments later, Owen resurfaced. ""Yes! Yeah! Oh yeah, who's the man?"" he whooped over his teammate's cheers.

Back at the clifftop, Chris made use of his megaphone once more. ""The winners! The Screaming Gophers!""

""Well done, Owen,"" Brick complimented him until he noticed the big guy looking around. ""What's wrong?""

""I, uh, think I lost my bathing suit,"" Owen admitted, and he received a lot of disgusted remarks from the campers.

(Commercial Break)

The Gophers were carrying their crates in carts back to the cabins and singing '99 Bottles of Pop'.

""Forty-nine bottles of pop on the wall, forty-nine bottles of pop! If one of those bottles should happen to fall, forty-eight bottles of pop on the wall!""

The Bass, on the other hand, were struggling with their crates. They had to carry, push, or kick the crates to the campgrounds.

Courtney was pushing her crate until she stopped suddenly. ""I think I just got a splinter!"" the control freak inspected her hand in a bothered manner.

Eva came over and lifted Courtney's crate. ""Shut up and pick up your crate!"" She dropped the crate in front of her. ""Chicken!""

""Hey! I'm the only one with CIT camping experience here!"" Courtney said back. ""You need me!""

Her statement caused Eva and Shawn to look at each other in disbelief.

The camera quick-panned back to the other team. As they sang past the thirty-second bottle, Lindsay found a conch shell on the ground. After picking it up and inspecting it, she left it on the ground and ran to catch up with the other Gophers.

Over on the Bass, Shawn dropped the crate he was carrying. ""I have to go pee,"" he informed his team.

""Hurry up,"" Eva said to Shawn. ""We're already behind.""

""Oh, I have to go too,"" Katie said while she and her friend were pushing a crate together.

""You do? Oh my gosh, me too!"" Sadie responded and they stopped pushing and followed Shawn. However, they decided to go a different direction than him.

A fly flew around Courtney's face, causing the girl to smack it at her right eye. As a result, it became swollen. ""I think something just bit me!"" she complained.

The scene cut back to the Gophers. ""...should happen to fall, twenty-eight bottles of pop on the wall!""

The team came to a stop. ""Hey look!"" Beth said as she looked at the cabins. ""There's the campgrounds!""

""That was pretty easy!"" Owen bragged.

""I'm pleasantly surprised!"" Cody added.

Meanwhile, Eva saw Sadie and Katie coming their way. ""All better?"" she asked.

""Yep!"" Katie answered.

""Can we go now? I think my eye is swelling up,"" Courtney said as the BFFFLs pushed a crate in front of her, their butts starting to turn red.

""Ooh, something's itching me,"" Sadie whined. ""Are you itchy too?""

Katie looked at Sadie. ""Totally itchy. Really bad.”

The camera cut to Chris walking past Brick, Noah, and Sky as they worked to open a pair of crates by using their teeth. ""Remember, you guys can only use your teeth to open the crates!"" the host said. ""I came up with that one!""

Brick was focused on as he pulled on the rope. ""I think I got it open!"" He yanked the rope, and the crate opened to show materials. ""Rope burn on my tongue!"" he winced in pain.

The footage changed back to Katie and Sadie noticing their burning butts turning more red. ""Ooh, it's really itching now,"" the latter said.

""Mine feels like it's burning,"" Katie replied.

""Okay, I have to scratch!"" Sadie declared, causing the two girls to stop pushing and start scratching their butts.

Chris was pulling up on his red ATV. ""You guys are way behind the other team,"" Chris criticized them. ""Like, way behind. What's the problem?""

""Their butts are itchy!"" Courtney answered.

Chris caught a glimpse of Courtney's swollen eye and winced. ""Ooh, that's bad!""

""Did you girls squat down when you peed in the woods?"" Rodney started to question the itchy girls.

""Yeah,"" Katie replied.

""Did you notice what kind of plants you were squatting over?"" Rodney continued.

""They were kind of oval-shaped and green and all over the place,"" Sadie answered.

""Were they low to the ground? About this big?"" Rodney physically described the plant, and the girls nodded. ""You two squatted on poison ivy.""

After hearing those words, Katie and Sadie stopped scratching their butts and began to panic.

""No way. That's awesome!"" Chris chuckled at their pain.

""Somebody help us!"" Katie shouted as she and Sadie were rubbing their butts against the sand.

Back at the campgrounds, the Gophers had managed to open a few of their crates and were now looking through their contents.

Owen pulled out two pairs of wood. ""Hey, check it out! I got wood!""

Brick took out a hammer and a pool liner. ""I've got some tools here, and what looks like a pool liner.”

Jo was also looking for tools until Heather and Lindsay went up to her. ""I just wanted to say,"" the queen bee said, ""I didn't mean all those insults about you before. And I love your hoodie. It's so bold.""

""I know a fake apology when I see one,"" Jo replied, unconvinced. ""Just contribute more to the team other than looking pretty and I won't think about voting you off first.""

""I completely understand you throwing me off the cliff. I needed a push,"" Heather said and she and Lindsay walked off.

""You didn't mean all that stuff you said to Jolene back there?"" Lindsay wondered.

""Jo?"" Heather corrected. ""Of course I didn't mean it. She's going down. And P.S.? That is the ugliest hoodie I've seen in my life.""

""Ohh,"" Lindsay said, still rather confused while Heather applied lip gloss onto her lips. ""So if you hate her, why were you being nice to her?""

""You ever seen one of these shows before? Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer,"" Heather explained.

""Ohhhhh..."" Lindsay understood. ""I'm your friend, right?""

""Oh yeah. For now,"" Heather answered uncaringly and walked off.

Brick, Noah, and Sky were standing near their crate until they saw the Killer Bass, particularly Harold, Ezekiel, and Courtney, arriving with crates on their hands.

""Finally!"" Harold panted.

""Hello, Bass,"" Brick greeted the team.

Jo rose up from the crate. ""What happened to the Screeching Twins?"" Her question caused the Bass to look around.

Sadie and Katie had their shorts pulled down and were soaking their butts on the ocean in order to get rid of the rashes.

""They're getting a drink,"" Courtney answered.

""Yeah, if they drink with their butts,"" Harold whispered to Ezekiel.

""That's funny,"" Ezekiel laughed.

Brick took notice of Courtney's eye and yelped. ""What happened to your eye?""

""Nothing. Just an allergy,"" Courtney claimed.

""Think it's getting worse,"" Ezekiel noted.

""Shut up!"" Courtney shushed. ""We don't want them to know that!""

The scene cut to Shawn standing on top of a few crates. ""Guys, it's not too late for us to still win!"" he tried to coach his team, but his speech didn't inspire the team, and they were all looking bored and unwilling to do anything.

Ezekiel was shown to be picking his nose, causing Courtney to complain with an “Ew!”

""What?"" Ezekiel wiped the snot on his pants.

""That's really gross,” Mike flinched.

""Okay, look guys,"" Courtney stood up and got everyone's attention. ""We have a hot tub to complete, and we need a project manager. Since I've actually been a CIT before, I'm electing myself. Any objections?""

""Where do we begin, Cyclops?"" Duncan mocked, making everyone gasp.

""Open the crates!"" Courtney glared at him. ""Mike, go find those itchy girls. We need all the help we can get.""

For the Gophers, Lightning and Beth were hammering in the nails. For the Bass, Harold and Shawn were stacking the wood together, but due to the instability, the pool fell apart.

Heather handed Brick a hammer to plug a nail into the pool. Duncan and Mike were fighting over who gets the hammer. It fell out of their hands, and it landed on Harold's crotch. Ella picked up a board and unintentionally hit Harold in the head with it multiple times.

The Gophers had formed a bucket brigade between the lake and their tub. From Noah to Cody to Lightning to Sky, the water was poured into the pool. The Bass, on the other hand, were shown fixing a leak that appeared by putting duct tape on the hole courtesy of Courtney.

The scene cut to both teams standing by their hot tubs with Chris looking at them.

Chris looked at the Screaming Gophers'. ""This is an awesome hot tub!"" he exclaimed, and the Gophers cheered.

""Nice!"" Owen said, popping out of the tub with a splash.

Chris approached the Bass, who gasped as Chris was squirted by a leak. Eventually, the tub couldn't hold and it got disassembled.

""Well, I think we have a winner here!"" Chris decided. ""The Screaming Gophers!""

The Gophers cheered and the Bass looked glum. ""Gophers!"" Chris told the winning team, ""you're safe from elimination and you get to rock this awesome hot tub for the rest of the summer! Bonus!""

The Gophers cheered again.

""Killer Bass!"" Chris turned his head to them. ""What can I say? Sucks to be you right now! I'll see your sorry butts at the bonfire tonight.""

""We won! We all get to stay here for another three days!"" Lindsay cheered alongside Beth and Heather.

They were cut short by Owen, who was cheering as well, but was butt-naked with his groin being pixelated. “Yes! We get to stay-ay! We get to stay-ay! We are so awesome! We won the contest!” He rushed up to hug the three, who were feeling disturbed.

The camera cut to the Mess Hall. The Gophers were eating while the Bass were in the middle of a discussion.

""So, uh, what do we do now?"" Katie asked from her seat.

""We have to figure out who we're gonna vote off,"" Courtney replied.

""Well I think it should be Princess or the Country Boy here,"" Duncan listed out Courtney and Rodney.

""What? Why?"" Courtney questioned him.

""Because, unless I'm mistaken, you two are the only ones here wearing chicken hats. And if we ever have to lift a truck, I like our odds with the big guy,"" Duncan smiled at Rodney, who was happy as well.

""But you guys need me,” Courtney protested. “I'm the only one-""

Mike suddenly inhaled deeply and as he let the breath out, he closed one eye, curled his lips inward and put a hand on his lower back. ""Enough already with your hankering about being a CIT!"" he exclaimed in a grumpier, elderly-sounding voice.

""Uh, Mike, are you okay?” Ezekiel asked.

“Mike? Name's Chester, mister,” the old man introduced himself and focused on Courtney. “And who would you wanna blame for today's loss?”

""What about… you?"" Courtney pointed to Chester.

""Hey, at least he jumped off the cliff, chicken wing,"" Duncan said.

""Shut up!"" Courtney got into Duncan's face.

Shawn got in-between them. ""Okay, we should chill out before we all lose our minds, and the zombies should be taking them.""

""I've had enough prison food for one day. I'm gonna go have a nap,"" Duncan got up and walked off.

""You can't do that! We haven't decided who's going yet!"" Courtney called.

“I think we already have,” Eva said as she and the others also walked off, leaving Courtney by herself to groan.

The scene cuts to the Killer Bass at the elimination ceremony.

""Killer Bass,"" Chris said while holding a plate of marshmallows. ""At camp, marshmallows represent a tasty treat that you enjoy roasting by the fire. At this camp, marshmallows represent life.""

Mike was feeling anxious, but turned to smile at Ella, who also smiled as well.

""You've all cast your votes,"" Chris continued, ""and made your decision. There are only ten marshmallows on this plate! When I call your name, come up and claim your marshmallow. The camper who does not receive a marshmallow tonight must immediately return to the Dock of Shame to catch the Boat of Losers. That means, you're out of the contest. And you can't come back. Ever.""

""The first marshmallow goes to...Ezekiel!"" The homeschooler smiled, and approached the host to get a marshmallow put on the stick he held.

""Shawn!""

""Sweet!"" Shawn gleamed and went to get his treat.

""Katie!""

""Ella!""

""Rodney!""

""Harold!""

“Yes!” Harold celebrated and got off his stump.

""Sadie!""

""Oh yay!"" Sadie gained her marshmallow and hugged Katie. ""Thank you, thank you, thank you!”

""Eva!""

""Duncan!""

Courtney and Mike were left.

""Campers,"" Chris said, ""this is the final marshmallow of the evening!""

The bottom two looked nervously at each other and waited for Chris to announce the last person safe.

…

…

…

…

""Mike.""

As Courtney felt sad, Mike ran up to get his stick that Chris put a marshmallow on.

""Can't say I'm shocked,"" Chris said. ""You didn't come through for your team."" He made his way over to Courtney. ""Dock of Shame is that way!""

Courtney started walking, and the footage skipped ahead to her walking the Dock of Shame alone.

""The rest of you!"" Chris addressed the remaining Bass. ""Enjoy your marshmallows! You're all safe. For tonight.""

Courtney was shown at the end of the dock as the Boat of Losers, driven by Chef, arrived.

Confessional: Ezekiel

""I really don't understand how we lost the challenge eh,"" Ezekiel confessed. “I was going to bring it up earlier, but Mike's acting made me lose my train of thought.”

Confessional Ends

The scene cut to the Gophers partying. Brick, Lindsay, Cody, Heather, and Lightning were all enjoying the hot tub, and Cody raised a glass to toast. ""To the Screaming Gophers!"" The four in the tub with him repeated the toast, and they all cheered. Those that weren't in the tub also cheered.

""Go Gophers! Go Gophers!"" Owen began to dance in front of the tub. Noah and Sky joined in, the three chanting ""Go Gophers!"" over and and over again.

Confessional: Jo

""My team won the first challenge of the season, and I'm all for winning,"" Jo said ominously, ""but a real competitor knows it isn't over until there's only one left standing. And that's gonna be me,"" she snarled dangerously.

[[Browse top-rated cup 600ml on Amazon]](https://petsknows.com/hot-selling-items/?kw=cup+600ml)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a suitable 600ml cup involves considering several key features that contribute to its overall performance, durability, and user experience. These features encompass material composition, insulation capabilities, design aesthetics, and ease of maintenance.

**Material Composition:** The material used in the construction of a 600ml cup significantly impacts its durability, temperature retention, and overall safety. Common materials include stainless steel, plastic (BPA-free), glass, and ceramic. Stainless steel is known for its robustness and excellent insulation, while BPA-free plastic offers a lightweight and cost-effective alternative. Glass provides a pure taste experience but can be more fragile. Ceramic cups offer aesthetic appeal and are suitable for hot beverages.

**Insulation Capabilities:** For those who prefer to keep their beverages hot or cold for extended periods, insulation is a crucial factor. Insulated cups typically employ double-walled construction, creating a vacuum layer that minimizes heat transfer. The effectiveness of insulation varies depending on the quality of the materials and the design of the cup. High-end insulated cups can maintain beverage temperatures for several hours.

**Design Aesthetics and Ergonomics:** The design of a 600ml cup plays a significant role in its user experience. Ergonomic considerations include the shape and size of the handle (if any), the overall weight of the cup, and the ease of gripping. Aesthetically pleasing designs can enhance the enjoyment of using the cup daily. Some cups feature sleek, minimalist designs, while others incorporate vibrant colors and patterns.

**Lid Design and Leak-Proofing:** The lid design is critical for preventing spills and maintaining beverage temperature. Look for lids that provide a secure fit and incorporate features like a sliding closure or a flip-top mechanism. Leak-proof designs are essential for those who plan to use the cup on the go, ensuring that beverages remain contained even when the cup is tilted or inverted.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance:** A 600ml cup should be easy to clean and maintain to ensure hygiene and longevity. Cups with wide mouths are generally easier to clean by hand, while dishwasher-safe models offer added convenience. Some cups may require special cleaning instructions to preserve their finish or insulation properties.

**Durability and Longevity:** The cup's ability to withstand daily wear and tear is an important consideration. Look for cups made from high-quality materials that are resistant to scratches, dents, and other forms of damage. A durable cup will provide years of reliable use, making it a worthwhile investment.

Key features of a great 600ml cup include:

*   Durable construction
*   Effective insulation
*   User-friendly design
*   Leak-proof lid

 ## Core Benefits

Choosing the right 600ml cup offers several practical benefits that enhance daily life. From improved hydration to increased convenience, these cups provide tangible advantages for a variety of users.

**Enhanced Hydration:** A 600ml cup encourages increased water intake throughout the day. Its generous capacity reduces the frequency of refills, making it easier to stay hydrated, especially for individuals with busy schedules or those who engage in physical activities. Regular hydration supports overall health and well-being.

**Convenient Beverage Consumption:** The 600ml capacity is ideal for enjoying larger servings of various beverages, including coffee, tea, smoothies, and iced drinks. This eliminates the need for multiple smaller cups, providing a more convenient and satisfying drinking experience. It's also great for making sure you're taking enough of a supplement powder, for example.

**Cost Savings and Environmental Friendliness:** By using a reusable 600ml cup, consumers can reduce their reliance on disposable cups, leading to both cost savings and a smaller environmental footprint. Reusable cups help minimize waste and conserve resources, aligning with sustainable living practices. If you purchase one coffee per day for a year, for example, you will save a ton of money using a travel mug.

**Versatility and Portability:** Many 600ml cups are designed for portability, featuring travel-friendly lids and durable construction. This makes them suitable for use at home, in the office, during commutes, or while traveling. Their versatility ensures that users can enjoy their favorite beverages wherever they go.

**Temperature Retention for Hot and Cold Drinks:** Insulated 600ml cups maintain the temperature of beverages for extended periods, allowing users to enjoy hot coffee or ice-cold water for hours. This is particularly beneficial for those who spend long hours at work or outdoors, ensuring that their drinks remain at the desired temperature.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions about 600ml cups helps clarify their features, benefits, and suitability for different users.

**Are all 600ml cups dishwasher safe?**
    Not all 600ml cups are dishwasher safe. It depends on the material and construction. Stainless steel and BPA-free plastic cups are often dishwasher safe, while glass and ceramic cups may require hand washing. Always check the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning recommendations.

**How long can an insulated 600ml cup keep drinks hot or cold?**
    The duration of temperature retention varies depending on the quality of the insulation. High-end insulated cups can keep drinks hot for up to 12 hours and cold for up to 24 hours. Lower-quality cups may only maintain temperature for a few hours.

**Can I use a 600ml cup for both hot and cold beverages?**
    Yes, most 600ml cups can be used for both hot and cold beverages. However, it's important to choose a cup made from materials that can withstand temperature changes without cracking or leaching harmful chemicals. Stainless steel and glass are generally safe for both hot and cold drinks.

**Are there any health concerns associated with using plastic 600ml cups?**
    Health concerns are primarily associated with plastic cups that contain BPA (Bisphenol A). BPA is a chemical that can leach into beverages and potentially cause adverse health effects. To avoid these concerns, choose 600ml cups made from BPA-free plastic or opt for alternative materials like stainless steel or glass.

1.	Neolithic matriarchal societies. The Language of the Goddess – ~7000–3000 BCE
	2.	The Code of Hammurabi – ~1754 BCE
	3.	The Old Testament (Genesis) – ~1000–500 BCE
	4.	Ancient Greece – ~500–300 BCE
	5.	Witch Hunts in Europe – ~1450–1750 CE


SLIDE 6: History of Feminism as a Concept. Mentioning other honorable moments pre the first wave that women achieved through history. 
Although the struggle began earlier, these are the waves of feminism as a social movement:

	•	First wave: suffrage and education
	•	Second wave: labor and reproductive rights
	•	Third wave: diversity and intersectionality
	•	Fourth wave: digital feminism and trans inclusion

SLIDE 7: EVE by Cat Bohannon
The book critiques how science has ignored the female body and proposes a rewrite of biological history from this perspective. It also explores compelling questions like: why do women get Alzheimer more often? Why do women live longer? 

	•	Rosalind Franklin: her Photo 51 was ignored and used without credit.
	•	Birth control pill: unethical testing on poor and mentally ill women.
Reflection: Who owns knowledge? Who has been excluded?

SLIDE 9: Global Feminism
Feminism takes different forms around the world: liberal, radical, African womanism, Islamic feminism, Latin American decolonial. They share goals but may conflict or contradict.

Slide 10: Data Feminism, Invisible Women, and AI

Data Feminism (Catherine D’Ignazio & Lauren Klein) challenges bias in data science, advocating for inclusivity.

Invisible Women (Caroline Criado Perez) exposes the gender data gap, showing how systems often neglect women’s needs.



SLIDE 11: Core Quote
“We are not free until all of us are free.”
This represents the vision of intersectional feminism.

SLIDE 12: Current Realities
Despite progress, serious inequalities persist.
Virginie Despentes (King Kong Theory) talks about taboo-free feminism and criticizes the idea that being desired equals freedom.

SLIDE 13: Internal Feminist Critiques
	•	Work: Access exists, but systems ignore women’s bodies.
	•	Health: Medical bias favors men.
	•	Industry: Feminism has been commercialized.
Key works: Invisible Women, Unwell Women, Caliban and the Witch, Feminism for the 99%, Bad Feminist.

SLIDE 14: The Economy of Female Exploitation
The exploitation of women generates $500–600 billion yearly (through prostitution, porn, OnlyFans, forced labor, etc.).
This rivals major global industries (like airlines or coffee), exposing a parallel economy rooted in inequality and violence.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The market offers a diverse range of 60 ml cups, each with distinct characteristics that cater to specific needs.

**Material and Construction:** The material used in a 60 ml cup greatly impacts its durability, heat resistance, and overall suitability for different applications. Options range from glass and ceramic to stainless steel and plastic.

Glass cups are prized for their transparency and inertness, ensuring that they don't affect the taste of the contents. They are, however, more susceptible to breakage. Ceramic cups offer good heat retention and a comfortable feel, but can also be fragile. Stainless steel cups are exceptionally durable and resistant to corrosion, making them suitable for rigorous use. Plastic cups are lightweight and shatterproof, making them ideal for outdoor or travel use, but may not be as resistant to heat or chemicals.

**Measurement Accuracy:** For many applications, the accuracy of the 60 ml measurement is paramount. Some cups feature clearly marked graduations, while others rely on the cup's inherent volume.

Cups with printed or etched graduations offer the highest level of precision, allowing users to accurately measure liquids and solids. The clarity and durability of these markings are crucial factors to consider. Cups without graduations may still provide a reliable measurement, but their accuracy depends on the consistency of the manufacturing process. Calibration tests can be performed to verify the actual volume.

**Design and Ergonomics:** The design of a 60 ml cup influences its ease of use, stability, and aesthetic appeal. Factors to consider include the cup's shape, handle (if any), and overall dimensions.

A wide base provides stability and prevents accidental spills. A comfortable handle, if present, enhances grip and control. The cup's shape can also affect its pouring characteristics and ease of cleaning. Some cups are designed with tapered walls for smooth pouring, while others feature rounded edges for easy rinsing.

**Heat Resistance and Durability:** Depending on the intended use, heat resistance and durability are essential considerations. Cups used for hot beverages or laboratory experiments must be able to withstand high temperatures without cracking or leaching harmful chemicals.

Glass and ceramic cups are generally well-suited for hot liquids, but it's important to check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure they are rated for the intended temperature range. Stainless steel cups offer excellent heat resistance and can withstand extreme temperatures. Plastic cups vary in their heat resistance, with some being specifically designed for microwave or dishwasher use.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Regular cleaning is necessary to maintain hygiene and prevent the buildup of residue. The cup's material and design can significantly affect its ease of cleaning.

Smooth, non-porous materials like glass and stainless steel are generally easy to clean with soap and water. Ceramic cups may require more thorough scrubbing to remove stubborn stains. Plastic cups can sometimes retain odors or stains, depending on the type of plastic. Cups with simple designs and wide openings are generally easier to clean than those with intricate shapes or narrow necks.

 ## Core Benefits

A high-quality 60 ml cup offers several practical benefits across various applications.

**Precise Portion Control:** For individuals monitoring their dietary intake or preparing recipes, a 60 ml cup provides accurate portion control. This helps maintain consistent measurements and avoid overconsumption. For example, it's useful for measuring oil or condiments.

Using a reliable 60 ml cup ensures that you're consuming the intended amount of each ingredient, leading to more predictable results in both cooking and dietary management. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals with specific dietary requirements or health goals.

**Consistent Espresso Extraction:** In the coffee industry, the 60 ml cup is a standard tool for measuring double espresso shots. Its precise volume allows baristas to consistently extract the desired amount of coffee, ensuring a balanced and flavorful beverage.

A consistent espresso shot is crucial for creating high-quality coffee drinks. Using a calibrated 60 ml cup helps baristas maintain consistency across multiple shots, resulting in a more enjoyable and predictable customer experience.

**Accurate Measurement for Scientific Applications:** Laboratories and research facilities often require precise measurements of small volumes of liquids. A 60 ml cup, particularly those with graduations, provides a reliable and convenient tool for measuring reagents, samples, and other solutions.

The accuracy of measurements is critical in scientific research. A calibrated 60 ml cup ensures that researchers are using the correct proportions of each substance, leading to more reliable and reproducible results.

**Versatile Use in Culinary Arts:** Beyond espresso and portion control, a 60 ml cup can be used for a variety of culinary tasks, such as measuring spices, herbs, and other small ingredients. Its compact size makes it ideal for tasks that require precision and control.

The 60 ml cup is a versatile tool in the kitchen, allowing cooks and bakers to accurately measure small quantities of ingredients. This is particularly useful when working with potent spices or delicate flavorings.

 ## FAQs Section

**What materials are best for a 60 ml cup used for hot liquids?**

Glass and ceramic are generally excellent choices for holding hot liquids. Borosilicate glass offers superior heat resistance compared to standard glass. Stainless steel is also suitable but can become hot to the touch.

**How can I ensure the accuracy of a 60 ml cup without graduations?**

You can calibrate the cup by using a graduated cylinder or pipette to measure 60 ml of water and then marking the water level on the cup. This will give you a visual reference point for future measurements.

**Are plastic 60 ml cups safe for food and beverages?**

It depends on the type of plastic. Look for cups made from food-grade plastics like polypropylene (PP) or polyethylene (PE), which are generally considered safe for contact with food and beverages. Avoid cups made from plastics that may leach harmful chemicals, especially when exposed to heat.

**Can I use a 60 ml cup to measure dry ingredients like flour or sugar?**

Yes, you can, but be aware that the accuracy may be affected by how densely the dry ingredients are packed into the cup. For the most accurate measurements of dry ingredients, it's best to use measuring spoons or a kitchen scale.

A coffee professional I recently spoke to said I should do a smaller ratio when doing milk drinks (but still pull it at like 28-30 seconds) so that the coffee doesn't lose its strength with the milk...or something like that, maybe I misunderstood. 

  
Anyway, that worked well for the bag I used at the roaster where I met this guy. I just bought a bag from a different roaster and still did a smaller ratio than 1:2.

I used 17.5 grams in, 30 grams out for a cortado and it just tasted off. Bitter, woodsy, I dunno how to describe it. Should I try a higher ratio, maybe 1:2 (17.5 g in, 35 grams out)?

From the moment I met his family, they were cruel, picture full mean girl behaviour. His mom and two sisters would glare at me and refuse to speak to me, if I tried to join a conversation I was ignored like I was a ghost, invisible. Father in law seemed better, but I eventually realized he is an enabler of bad behaviour, so just as bad in my opinion.  

My inlaws favor the girls, they are two golden children who can do no wrong and hubby is the black sheep.  We tolerated the behaviour (keep the peace!) because they were very involved with my stepson and we didn't want family drama to affect him.  One of his sisters thinks she's a medical doctor (she isn't, she studied kinesiology which I am not downplaying. No PhD) and I am a registered nurse. Sister will constantly spout incorrect medical knowledge, has harmed people with her bad advice, and I'm the bad guy if I say anything.  MIL has called me rotten to the core and superficial because ..... I dared to buy jewelry for myself with my own money. Yes, really. I met stepson when he was 4, I never tried to replace his mom (alive but not involved, not even financially).  I was told by MIL that I wasn't welcome and to basically have minimal to do with stepson, that she and the sisters are the stand in mommies.  I then got treated badly for not taking a more motherly role. Wtf, it's obviously tie or lose.

COVID hits, and we no longer see my inlaws for an extended time period. And our marriage flourished!!! Self esteem increased, so happy all around!!  Turns out when the bullies are gone life is great. Until recently.

They are having Easter dinner.  I originally thought why not go, how bad can it be. But ... I have been having anxiety attacks just thinking about it.  Picturing the fake doctor sister mocking my nursing, being ignored by the others.  My mom died over a year ago, none of them even sent a text of condolence. Crickets.  I don't want them to bring it up as though they care.  Extended family will be there, and damn these people put on a show.  Fake forced hugs, sugary sweet greetings.  They don't want anyone to know what C U Next Tuesday's they are.

Anyway, I've decided I'm going no contact, they add no value to my life and I am happier without them.  I will not control my husband although it is hard to accept we are not united on this and he will not cut them off. They are not kind to him either, I can only guess he's so deep in the abuse cycle he won't willingly get out. I think he knows deep down that they don't really give a crap about him and would happily never see him again.  He has asked his dad for years just to go for coffee with him, it's always no. But if either sister wants to?  He runs for the car keys!  

I compared my recent anxiety attacks to a schoolyard bully. That imagine a child is told they have to share a lunch table with their tormentors how they'd react. That's how I feel.  I don't think ITA, but hubby is unsure.",27,1744934268.0,AITAH,23,1.0,False

I’d love to find some cool people to chat and connect with. I’m interested in connecting with people from all over. So, if you’re interested, send me a message with a bit about you and where you’re from. ",1,1744934189.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

I choose the category with the mot upvote, and I analise what could be the winner under the comments reply, and what reason are for the winning (I will also give my opinion)


----------
Commentary of the matches:

- Flayn --> won costumer services because Edelgard would have lost patient to its costumer. Edelgard tho can learn how to handle people and Flayn would have done something childish or sleep at work, but costumer would have prefered more Flayn for her attitude and cuteness

- Shez --> won best throwing hand at Denny's parking lot, even tho both would do it with no problem, Shez would have done more frequently, evenb tho losing to Byleth, and has a game that is all about mashing buttons
(note: this category is the second most upvoted, the other category with most upvote was just Hapi would won every competition, I think is very meme and would have been funny to put it, but I find at the end unfair bc I feel is not fair as a category)

- Petra --> won by asking the right order at the non-fodlander barista, with her and barista understanding each other better, and while challenging also for a duel, she end up receiving a strong tea, that is not coffee, but Petra receive the order she asked for so she won, while Bernie all shy ordered with a paper, but maybe barista couldnt read properly

- Raphael --> won by eating salad contest, it was a legendary battle between a person that love meat and a person that lack flavour of food. The salad was bad, but while Dimitri is said to be having no problem at the start of the match bc he lack food flavour, Raphael gained advantage till he could appreciated the salad flavour, and so he eaten all the food in the last part till winning
(I feel Dimitri could have won if people had said he eat weed, if that would have happen, I think he would have won, but comments are comments, and I follow replys sob)

And so it finish the first round of the 1 row of student, tho it was very funny to see very different and original idea, I cant wait to start the 1st round of the 2 row of student!!! I will post it soon

1k1ra2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/IUILadies/comments/1k1ra2e/iui_success_with_details/,IUI success with details,"Trigger - success 

As requested! This is long! I hope it’s helpful, I really loved reading about the details. And basing the below off the information requested in the comments from my previous post. 

I don’t know what actually helped make these successful and most stuff I did was just to tick all the boxes for me personally. I believe the biggest factor was getting the sperm to the right place at the right time and myself actually ovulating! The TWW details take as a grain of salt because people literally get pregnant on crack so my random juicing one IUI wasn’t a factor in success haha

Background - current age 33F and 34M. 

Cycles trying - since end of 2021 we started loosely trying which got progressively more tracked and active every cycle, tracking both BBT and ovulation sticks, resulted in zero pregnancies so booked appointment with a fertility clinic in August 2024. 

Diagnosed conditions: me - mild PCOS (cycles from 26-50 days) adenomyosis. Him - low volume, average to good quality, he also has ED induced by performance anxiety  which made hitting all our window days very hard. We would get 1-2 in then use an at home insemination kit to get in a few more days. Officially diagnosed with low volume and ovulation issues being the most likely cause of infertility. Recommend Medicated IUIs as a first step. AMH levels (50 pmol/L) are abnormally high which also is a factor of PCOS… this did not make me have more follicles in the IUIs! 

Supplements - both of us - CoQ10, Vit D, Vit C, fish oil and prenatal for us both, black Maca root for him and Myo instol for me. I also took melatonin 3mg from period to day after ovulation. I’ve been alcohol free since Feb 2024. I’ll make up for that one day!! 

IUI #1 
Letrozole CD 3-7 at 2.5mg 
First scan CD 9 - 1x 18mm follicle on left ovary lining 8.5mm and blood test which confirmed rise in LH
Started ovulation digital tests the night after scan and tested morning and night same time each day (no triggers for any of mine) 
Monday 7am I had a positive ovulation test
IUI procedure 11am that same morning. 
Sperm post wash was 11million 
Ovulated Tuesday lunchtime so day after IUI ( I have very painful ovulations) BBT rise that next morning 
TWW - I have a proper coffee machine so dropped down to a single shot as my only source of caffeine all day. I didn’t have any orgasms ( this one is controversial it was a personal preference, I follow 2 obgyns and love thru content and both advised to stay clear in TWW but don’t come at me pls haha) I follow a pretty healthy diet anyway but ate mostly meat/salmon, salads and sweet potatoes for dinner, breakfast and lunch was some form of eggs or protein shake for each or cottage cheese on crackers or my go to is Vietnamese for lunch if I buy it.  Nuts, rice crackers Hummas and fruit as a snack. The odd chocolate bar and we love a burger and chips somewhere new each week. Stayed on all supplements apart from CoQ10. Walked daily for 1-2 hours. Mentally I was in a good space and stayed positive but actually was like this isn’t going to work mindset 
Positive pregnancy test on 9DPO after some weird cramping 
(Lost this at 8.5 weeks from a MMC requiring and D&C then strong antibiotic care to pass retained tissue) 

IUI #2
8 weeks ish cycle can back after miscarriage) the entire cycle was off from the start, I had a really light period and got a flu and ovulation didn’t go well 
Letrozole 2.5mg day 3-7 
Scan CD9 - no dominant follicles, bloods negative for an LH rise.  6mm lining 
Scan CD 12 - no dominant follicles again 2 around 11/12mm, bloods negative for an LH rise
Scan CD16 - one 15mm on right ovary ( also came down with a bad flu this day) lining 7mm 
Sent home to do the ovulation testing 
Positive digital 2 days later
IUI that morning 
Sperm post wash 11 million 
Ovulated that night which was quick and painful 
TWW - I was sick so lots of chicken soup, was more relaxed with my diet tbh as was not feeling it. No orgasms again and decided to stay on my double shot coffee (again no science) has a very stressful work period over this TWW as well 
Failed cycle - we believe from an immature follicle releasing early 

IUI #3 
Very heavy period like a clean out post miscarriage cycle I think my body needed that! This was our last one before taking a break! I also added seed cycling into this one! 

Letrozole 5mg CD 3-7 (increased dose) 
CD9 scan showed 5 progressing follicles but no clear dominant all around 11-14mm 
CD 13 scan showed 3 follicles 1x 16mm, 14mm and 1x 12, bloods show start of LH increase. Lining was 7 or 8mm they couldn’t quite measure it this time. All follicles on right ovary 
Ovulation tests every morning and night
Positive test 4 days later 
IUI same day about 4 hours after positive test
Post sperm wash 8.5 million 
Ovulated the following morning after IUI
TWW - walks most days play similar diet to IUI#1 plus a few sweet treats and l limited caffeine. No orgasms. I did try something new! Fresh Beetroot, watermelon and ginger juice every morning with breakfast which was a home made egg avocado muffin split. I also listened to a lot of meditation music before bed and really tried to relax (I know I hate that word too) and just give up all control, I didn’t even track the cycle and actually made plans that this wouldn’t work so my next TTC steps) 
Positive pregnancy test - 9DPO no symptoms really and still too early for anything major (last time they kicked in 6 weeks) oh I forgot I had the McDonald’s fries IUI 2 & 3 post IUI for fun! 

Hoping for a healthy pregnancy and baby from this one as it’s still early days but again it’s out of my control what will happen so I’m just going with it and staying calm 

If you want to know anything else let me know  and good luck, there is hope and IUIs do work

Got a job that I thought would be amazing. Turns out I didn’t read the fine print. On paper I make great money, but it’s a maximum 30% of tips tipout (instead of tipout based on sales) before taxes, paying $10 a day to park 4-5 days a week, and having to pay into the discount program just to receive discounted meals and get free sodas and coffee on shift. And our job depends on selling rewards cards. Currently looking around again, as much as I hate to. Tried going back to my old job because they said they’d leave a door open for me, but they recently hired a bunch of people. But I’m making less than I was making before, and the people who do seem to like to work there have second jobs or a spouse with a second income.

I’m Rebecca and I have a very fun show coming up as part of  “Not Loud Concerts,” that I wanted to invite you to. It's a **Fantasy Waltz Night** and it's held at the **Chapel of the Flowers** in Berkley. The Chapel of the Flowers is an over 100 year old building that has been a funeral home, a sporting goods store, many other things, and now a music venue.



This concert is **Friday, April 25 at 7 pm** and will be a night of waltzes presented by a live chamber orchestra. 



The evening begins at 7:00 with a short beginning waltz lesson, followed by the orchestra picking up their bows to present a selection of danceable waltzes. From the Viennese waltzes of Johan Strauss II, to the magical sounds of Disney, to the rollicking waltzes of the frontier, members of the Renegade Orchestra will get your feet moving in 3/4 time.



This is a casual event, so no need to dress up (unless you want to.)

The floor is wood, the space is magical and the music is of course, not too loud. Complimentary coffee and cookies will be available.



Located at 3049 Adeline St, very close to the Ashby Bart station and with a private parking lot as well as street parking. 18 and up, children will not be admitted.



Please feel free to invite your friends!

1k1r5b5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianPolitics/comments/1k1r5b5/pierre_is_a_trump_wannabe/,Pierre is a Trump wannabe,"I've heard so many people talking over the last year about how Pierre Poilievre and the Conservatives are the ones who are going to ""fix"" our country. 

Here are 30 reasons I say, ""HELL no!"" to voting for Pierre Poilievre...

1. Pierre Poilievre has voted against the environment and climate nearly 400 times during his 20-year career as a Member of Parliament
2. He voted for cutting tens of billions from public health care funding. He also voted for the $196.1 billion cut to funds for surgery and reducing emergency wait times
3. Pierre Poilievre voted to ban abortions
4. He stood behind the Ottawa trucker convoy (He supplied coffee and donuts to the Trucker Convoy who were funded by MAGA and Russia)
5. He’s blamed Justin Trudeau for causing inflation in Canada, yet inflation was a problem GLOBALLY post-Covid and Canada actually had one of the lowest rates in the world
6. Pierre Poilievre voted against Covid relief for Canadians
7. He has little grasp on economics and believes in simple-minded trickle-down economics (the idea that tax cuts for the wealthy benefit everyone) that has been largely debunked by studies showing that these policies primarily benefit the wealthy and do not lead to meaningful economic growth or job creation for the broader population—just to a dangerous concentration of wealth
8. He voted to cancel school lunch programs to help children experiencing poverty
9. He instructed his MPs to keep silent on gay rights
10. Pierre Poilievre voted AGAINST housing initiatives including the First Home Savings Account program. He voted against initiatives to make housing affordable and address Canada's housing crisis in 2006, 2009, 2010, 2013, and 2014 when Conservatives were in power, and again in 2018 and 2018 as a member of the official opposition.
11. He voted against aid for Ukraine (and not a word about the death of Navalny…Putin’s number one political opponent who Russia poisoned and then likely killed in jail)
12. He voted to cancel Veterans Disability.
13. As an MP in 2008, Pierre Poilievre publicly said: “Canada’s Aboriginals need to learn the value of hard work more than they need compensation for abuse suffered in residential schools”
14. Pierre Poilievre clearly stated that he intends to implement MASSIVE austerity cuts and measures on pretty much *ALL* federal government spending, this could be very harmful and disastrous (think DOGE in the U.S.)
15. He scapegoated the Liberal government for causing the interest rate hikes, while Trudeau has zero power or influence over the Bank of Canada.
16. He voted against the Canada Child Benefit
17. Pierre Poilievre was Housing Minister in Stephen Harper’s Conservative government, which allowed 800,000 affordable rental units to be sold off to corporate landlords and developers. Also, during that time, the average home price in Canada went up 70% (worse than the 45% increase under the Liberals).
18. He voted to slash OAS/CPP (old age security and pension plan)
19. He’s threatening to take away certain transgender rights
20. Pierre Poilievre’s chief strategist is a lobbyist for Galen Weston and Loblaws.
21. He has no environmental plan except to gut all the substantial climate crisis programs. He advocates for the fossil fuel industry’s preference for doing nothing and claims we’ll fix the environmental crisis through “technology” that has not yet been invented
22. Pierre Poilievre keeps refusing to get national security clearance
23. He and the Conservatives have been THE WORST on animal protection issues. Voting FOR a federal ag-gag bill and AGAINST things like banning live horse export for slaughter and ending some of the most torturous forms of animal experimentation
24. Pierre Poilievre constantly claimed the Carbon Tax (air pollution fines) is the main driver of inflation in Canada, even though he KNOWS that that is completely false and was proven so.
25. He voted to cut support for unemployed workers
26. He publicly stated that he would not support Pharmacare and the Canadian Dental Care Plan
27. He advocates for US-style “right-to-work” laws. Between 2004 and 2023, Poilievre voted against federal anti-scab legislation 8 times.
28. Pierre Poilievre publicly stated that he will defund the CBC
29. He advocated to replace Canadian money with Bitcoin
30. Nearly half of the governing body for Poilievre’s Conservative Party are lobbyists for oil companies, pharmaceutical companies, corporate landlords’ associations, anti-union construction associations, and business associations that advocate against wage increases for workers.

So here, you go-

The Red File



Dhiraj was only supposed to clean out the storage room.



His first week at the law firm had been uneventful—fetching coffee, making copies, and attending meetings he wasn’t invited to speak in. So when the senior partner, Mrs. Kapoor, tossed him a ring of old keys and pointed to the locked basement door, he thought nothing of it. “Clear it out,” she said. “Burn what’s outdated. Don’t touch the red file.”



That should’ve been a red flag.



But curiosity always itched in Dhiraj’s bones.



The basement was dark, cold, and filled with stacks of dusty files. Shelves groaned under the weight of boxes, each one sealed tight with thick tape, their labels nearly illegible from years of neglect. It smelled like old paper and something faintly metallic, like iron left out in the rain. The air felt dense, like the room had secrets it didn’t want to share.



Dhiraj didn’t mind. He was used to cleaning up other people's messes.



He dragged a cart along the concrete floor, shifting box after box into the flickering light. His eyes scanned through the piles, his mind already halfway out the door. But then, tucked in a corner, something caught his attention.



A red folder, standing out against the sea of yellowing manila. It was so… vibrant. So intentionally out of place.



The red file.



He could hear Mrs. Kapoor’s voice in his head: Don’t touch it.



But curiosity had already sunk its teeth into him.



He pulled it from the shelf. The paper was stiff, like it hadn’t been touched in years, and it crackled as he opened it. Inside were a series of documents—contracts, briefings, photos. The names were familiar. High-profile clients the firm had represented. But there was something strange about the case number written in the corner of each page: X13/11.



Dhiraj flipped through the papers, his fingers tingling. As he reached the last page, two black-and-white photos slipped out—grainy but clear.



The first was a picture of a man, standing in front of a sleek, modern building. He looked ordinary—just a businessman. The second photo was of the same man, but now, his face was smeared, unrecognizable, as if someone had deliberately blurred it out. At the bottom of the photo was a note: “Never speak to him again.”



Dhiraj’s heart skipped a beat. Something didn’t sit right. This wasn’t a typical legal case file. This was personal.



He was about to shut the file when his phone buzzed, breaking his concentration. It was a message from Mrs. Kapoor:



“I see you’ve found it. Leave it alone.”



His fingers froze on the screen. How did she know?



A loud bang came from upstairs, followed by the sharp screech of a door opening. Dhiraj’s breath caught in his throat. The building was empty. He hadn’t heard anyone else around for hours.



“Hello?” His voice echoed in the basement, but no answer came.



He closed the red file and shoved it back into the box, trying to shake off the unease that was gnawing at him. As he moved to leave, the basement door creaked open, and Mrs. Kapoor appeared at the top of the stairs.



Her eyes locked on his, cold and unblinking.



“You shouldn’t have opened it,” she said, her voice low. “Do you know what you’ve done?”



Dhiraj’s pulse quickened. “I—I didn’t know. I just… I found it.”



She stepped closer, the air around her growing heavy. “You’ve triggered something you can’t undo. You have no idea what this file represents. What it’s tied to.”



“What is it? What’s going on?” Dhiraj asked, his voice shaking.



Mrs. Kapoor didn’t answer. Instead, she reached into her bag, pulling out a small, old-fashioned key. She handed it to him, her fingers brushing his briefly.



“Take this,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “You’ll need it.”



Dhiraj took it instinctively, confused, but the moment the cold metal touched his palm, a strange sense of dread washed over him. The basement door slammed shut behind him, and the lights flickered once more.



“Do you hear that?” Mrs. Kapoor asked, her eyes never leaving his.



Dhiraj strained to listen. Faintly, almost like a whisper in the walls, came a voice—soft, yet distinct: “You shouldn’t have come here. You shouldn’t have opened the file.”



The words sent a chill down his spine. He looked back at Mrs. Kapoor, but she was gone.



The basement was silent again.



Shaking, Dhiraj rushed to the door. As he turned the key, he found it stuck, as if someone on the other side was holding it shut. The whispers grew louder, more frantic.



“Leave... NOW...”



With a burst of adrenaline, Dhiraj yanked the door open, rushing out into the dark hallway. The firm was quiet—too quiet. No one else was around.



But the whispers didn’t stop.



That night, as he lay in bed, exhausted and trembling, the buzzing of his phone woke him up. It was a new message from Mrs. Kapoor:



“I told you to leave it alone. It’s too late now. They’re coming for you.”



The next morning, Dhiraj arrived at the office to find it deserted. The lights flickered, and the building had an eerie, abandoned feel to it—despite the fact that it was only 9 AM.



He walked to the basement, the key still in his pocket. He felt its weight, like an anchor, pulling him back to the room he had just left.



But when he opened the door to the storage room, the red file was gone.



And in its place? A new file, marked with his name on the top in thick, black ink.



He flipped it open. The pages were full of familiar names, cases, and photos. But the last photo made his blood run cold. It was a picture of him, taken from behind. The same blurred, smeared effect on his face, just like the man in the earlier photo.



At the bottom of the page was a note: “Now you’re one of us.”



His fingers trembled as he looked around the room. He felt something watching him.



He reached into his pocket to pull out the key—only to find it was gone.",0,1744933280.0,horror,2,0.38,False

She works selling coffee with another student (18M) in our school who is in our ESL program. She loves working with him and has even made him gifts. However, she's made it clear that she only sees him as a friend.

This other student has told her ""I love you"" multiple times. The first time was during a tornado drill when the ESL class joined her math class, and he said it again while they were selling coffee.

My student (16F) is feeling awkward and wants to communicate to him that she only wants to be friends. The catch is, he is still learning English, and she doesn't know any Spanish. She's asked *me* (32M), English and Spanish teacher at the high school, if I would be willing to talk to him for her and explain the situation.

I can see that she is trying to be kind and doesn't want to hurt his feelings. Since I also teach Spanish, I feel like I *could* potentially help bridge this communication gap. However, I'm also a little hesitant to get directly involved in their personal interactions. It feels a bit outside my typical role as a teacher.

So I'm looking for advice on how to best handle this situation.

* **Should I talk to him directly in Spanish?** If so, what's the best way to phrase it in a way that is clear but also sensitive to his feelings?
* **Are there other ways my student could communicate her feelings to him?**
* **What are the potential pitfalls of me getting involved?** I don't want to create any misunderstandings.
* **Any general advice on navigating these kinds of delicate situations in a school setting?**

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",7,1744933163.0,Teachers,3,1.0,False

Dhiraj was only supposed to clean out the storage room.



His first week at the law firm had been uneventful—fetching coffee, making copies, and attending meetings he wasn’t invited to speak in. So when the senior partner, Mrs. Kapoor, tossed him a ring of old keys and pointed to the locked basement door, he thought nothing of it. “Clear it out,” she said. “Burn what’s outdated. Don’t touch the red file.”



That should’ve been a red flag.



But curiosity always itched in Dhiraj’s bones.



The basement was dark, cold, and filled with stacks of dusty files. Shelves groaned under the weight of boxes, each one sealed tight with thick tape, their labels nearly illegible from years of neglect. It smelled like old paper and something faintly metallic, like iron left out in the rain. The air felt dense, like the room had secrets it didn’t want to share.



Dhiraj didn’t mind. He was used to cleaning up other people's messes.



He dragged a cart along the concrete floor, shifting box after box into the flickering light. His eyes scanned through the piles, his mind already halfway out the door. But then, tucked in a corner, something caught his attention.



A red folder, standing out against the sea of yellowing manila. It was so… vibrant. So intentionally out of place.



The red file.



He could hear Mrs. Kapoor’s voice in his head: Don’t touch it.



But curiosity had already sunk its teeth into him.



He pulled it from the shelf. The paper was stiff, like it hadn’t been touched in years, and it crackled as he opened it. Inside were a series of documents—contracts, briefings, photos. The names were familiar. High-profile clients the firm had represented. But there was something strange about the case number written in the corner of each page: X13/11.



Dhiraj flipped through the papers, his fingers tingling. As he reached the last page, two black-and-white photos slipped out—grainy but clear.



The first was a picture of a man, standing in front of a sleek, modern building. He looked ordinary—just a businessman. The second photo was of the same man, but now, his face was smeared, unrecognizable, as if someone had deliberately blurred it out. At the bottom of the photo was a note: “Never speak to him again.”



Dhiraj’s heart skipped a beat. Something didn’t sit right. This wasn’t a typical legal case file. This was personal.



He was about to shut the file when his phone buzzed, breaking his concentration. It was a message from Mrs. Kapoor:



“I see you’ve found it. Leave it alone.”



His fingers froze on the screen. How did she know?



A loud bang came from upstairs, followed by the sharp screech of a door opening. Dhiraj’s breath caught in his throat. The building was empty. He hadn’t heard anyone else around for hours.



“Hello?” His voice echoed in the basement, but no answer came.



He closed the red file and shoved it back into the box, trying to shake off the unease that was gnawing at him. As he moved to leave, the basement door creaked open, and Mrs. Kapoor appeared at the top of the stairs.



Her eyes locked on his, cold and unblinking.



“You shouldn’t have opened it,” she said, her voice low. “Do you know what you’ve done?”



Dhiraj’s pulse quickened. “I—I didn’t know. I just… I found it.”



She stepped closer, the air around her growing heavy. “You’ve triggered something you can’t undo. You have no idea what this file represents. What it’s tied to.”



“What is it? What’s going on?” Dhiraj asked, his voice shaking.



Mrs. Kapoor didn’t answer. Instead, she reached into her bag, pulling out a small, old-fashioned key. She handed it to him, her fingers brushing his briefly.



“Take this,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “You’ll need it.”



Dhiraj took it instinctively, confused, but the moment the cold metal touched his palm, a strange sense of dread washed over him. The basement door slammed shut behind him, and the lights flickered once more.



“Do you hear that?” Mrs. Kapoor asked, her eyes never leaving his.



Dhiraj strained to listen. Faintly, almost like a whisper in the walls, came a voice—soft, yet distinct: “You shouldn’t have come here. You shouldn’t have opened the file.”



The words sent a chill down his spine. He looked back at Mrs. Kapoor, but she was gone.



The basement was silent again.



Shaking, Dhiraj rushed to the door. As he turned the key, he found it stuck, as if someone on the other side was holding it shut. The whispers grew louder, more frantic.



“Leave... NOW...”



With a burst of adrenaline, Dhiraj yanked the door open, rushing out into the dark hallway. The firm was quiet—too quiet. No one else was around.



But the whispers didn’t stop.



That night, as he lay in bed, exhausted and trembling, the buzzing of his phone woke him up. It was a new message from Mrs. Kapoor:



“I told you to leave it alone. It’s too late now. They’re coming for you.”



The next morning, Dhiraj arrived at the office to find it deserted. The lights flickered, and the building had an eerie, abandoned feel to it—despite the fact that it was only 9 AM.



He walked to the basement, the key still in his pocket. He felt its weight, like an anchor, pulling him back to the room he had just left.



But when he opened the door to the storage room, the red file was gone.



And in its place? A new file, marked with his name on the top in thick, black ink.



He flipped it open. The pages were full of familiar names, cases, and photos. But the last photo made his blood run cold. It was a picture of him, taken from behind. The same blurred, smeared effect on his face, just like the man in the earlier photo.



At the bottom of the page was a note: “Now you’re one of us.”



His fingers trembled as he looked around the room. He felt something watching him.



He reached into his pocket to pull out the key—only to find it was gone.",0,1744932846.0,JEENEETards,7,0.5,False

I’m almost a six year partner in OC California. 

I am in desperate need of any and all advice out there!!!
I’m the current class of coffee master here in my district/region. 
The SM who is running it is doing it differently than others and how it was ran in the past she told us the this day one, which I’m OK with because it’s less work for us and no testing involved. 
She wants to do more of a hands-on approach and I’m cool with it but my question lays here…  each week Shes assigning three people to do a tasting and each person is assigned a region / origin. 

Well, I was picked /assigned for my next class which is tomorrow and it’s the first round of presentations we’ve done. 

I am doing Latin America as the origin and soft brew / pour over as the brew method… 

I don’t want to do Guatemala Antigua because I feel like that is so basic and so just obvious, typically using “blends” oppose to single origin, doesn’t really work out because a lot of of them are a mix from at least two different regions….  but with the new Sensara blend (that is all Latin America) and a blonde roast and I’m a blonde drinker!
 so I’m leaning towards that, I’m also going to go up to the store across the street from my house. They have reserve coffees, n see if they have anything up there to make me stand out but my question or advice I need for this: 
What do you think is a good roast / blend to use (in your opinion), if I go with since Sensara, what are some good pairings for food to use and mind you they don’t have to be Starbucks food I can bring in food from the outside for this. Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated.

I'm a relatively new DM, and this week I wrapped up my first-ever *Mothership* game — *The Haunting of Ypsilon-14*. We ran the mission across two 3-hour sessions, and I’ve got to say: it was an **absolute blast**.

While I’ve DM’d other systems before, this was my first time running *Mothership*, and it’s safe to say it’s going to be our go-to game for a while. The tension, the atmosphere, the chaos — it hit all the right notes.

One of my players is a meticulous note-taker, so I’ve put together an After Action Report based on their logs. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed playing!

Note: I made a small but important change to help motivate the players to explore the mine rather than just leave. In this version, Mike is a key part of the mission — the crew has been contracted to retrieve him and escort him to Prospero’s Dream, as his mining contract has expired.

**\*\*MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD\*\***

Far-Reach Recovery – Crew Log: Session Report 1

Salvage Vessel: Far-Reach Recovery (a.k.a. The Reacharound)

Company: Deep Horizon Salvage (DHS)

Date: Jan 01, 2150

Current Location: Near mining asteroid Ypsilon-14

Objective: Deliver cargo, retrieve mining engineer Mike for transfer to Prospero Dreams

Status: Compromised

Crew Present:

Case – Android, operations and procedure-focused, currently armed.

Ida – Android, analytical, calm under pressure.

Tahj – Teamster, capable and assertive, not thrilled about contractual ambiguity.

Delilah – Scientist, skilled in engineering and mechanical repair.

Jaina – Young teamster, tech-savvy, unofficial morale officer (source of coffee)

Brief:

Jaina brought Case and Ida online and defrosted Tahj and Delilah from cryo, introducing them to the fine dining and warm atmosphere of The Reacharound. The crew endured protein sludge breakfasts shaped like nostalgic meals (still grey sludge inside) and caffeine infusions (or maintenance tune-ups) before piling into Daisy, a rusty shuttle, shaped like a large old ute, with the aerodynamics of a toolbox.

Case piloted Daisy “within acceptable margins” to Ypsilon-14, where the crew met site manager Sonja and miners Kintaro, Morgan, and later, Rye. Mike, the mining engineer slated for transfer, was missing.

.

Welcome to Ypsilon-14:

Sonja refused to descend into the mine, citing a distinct lack of certification.

Tahj confronted Sonja over Mike’s status; deadlock over whose problem Mike officially is contractually.

Case and Ida investigated crew quarters:

\-- Rye: Found using narcotics, fled to start shift.

\-- Kintaro: Room in extreme disarray, yellow-goo-stained tissues, women’s underwear (his?).

\-- Mike: Packed belongings, air vent cover removed, water spray bottle and cassette tape recovered from air vent. Unknown entity spotted in vents (later identified as a cat named Jenkins).

Key Discoveries:

Cassette tape from Mike: Rambling, disturbed message. Mentions water. Claims:

“Something is wrong with the water. Please fix me. I broke the shower. It doesn’t like the water.”

Water collected from Ypsilon’s mess (Case) and sealed in a jar.

Kintaro had a violent fear reaction upon seeing water. Fled to showers, began smashing the plumbing.

Combat ensued:

\-- Case attempted a leg sweep (failed).

\-- Kintaro lifted Case in the air by their leg.

\-- Case shot Kintaro in the leg, yellow goo bled from the wound.

\-- Case disengaged; Tahj arrived with water spray and contained Kintaro.

Kintaro was confined to the washroom using a wet sheet over the door. He remains agitated, screaming about water.

.

\[Meeting the Doc:

Crew decided to confront Dr Giovanni, the xenobiologist parked in Shuttle Bay 1.

Intercom contact failed. After failed keypad attempts, Tahj cracked the airlock, triggering full shuttle access.

Inside the shuttle:

\-- Giovanni was found standing still, facing a wall.

\-- Upon turning, revealed a massive smile, yellow goo dripping from his mouth, same substance as Kintaro.

Session ends as the crew stands inside the shuttle, the lights flickering, and Giovanni smiling too wide.

Crew Notes:

The water may be contaminated.

Kintaro and Giovanni appear infected or altered by a parasitic or chemical agent.

Mike’s status is unknown but presumed compromised.

Immediate containment and decontamination protocol may be required.

Next Steps (Pending Orders):

Secure Dr Giovanni (or neutralise – possible salvage opportunity).

Continue search for Mike; likely within the mine.

Investigate source of contamination.

Re-establish contact with Command for quarantine options.

.

END OF TRANSMISSION

Far-Reach Recovery – Crew Log, Session Two:

Phase 1: Initial Contact

The crew boarded the Heracles to locate Dr. Giovanni. He appeared visibly compromised, grinning grotesquely with yellow biological fluid dripping from his mouth. Before contact could be made, Sonja was attacked by an invisible entity, consumed beginning with her arm. Tahj attempted to intervene with a crowbar, but was unsuccessful. Dr. Giovanni then broke down, emotionally and physically, crying hysterically before dissolving into bones and yellow goo. Ida recovered infrared goggles from the cockpit, revealing the three-toed claw prints of a large hostile entity that consumed Sonja before fleeing into the mine via the elevator shaft.

Giovanni’s body melted post-event.

Tahj recovered Sonja’s security pass.

Ida recovered the infrared goggles.

Case played Giovanni’s cassette logs, found on workbench, detailing research of the contaminant:

\-- Initial exposure to Worker 0779.

\-- Initial effects: positive response. Worker experiencing rapid healing of abrasions.

\-- Later phases: Subject now undergoing full cellular replacement.

\-- Final warning: ""Do not touch it!""

Case examined the petri-dish sample of the goo and provided a sample of android ‘flesh’ for analysis of reaction. Microscopy tests confirmed the goo has no effect on synthetic tissue, suggesting it only affects organic material.

To drive the remaining goo off the Heracles, Tahj activated the shuttle’s sprinkler system, prompting the substance to retreat back into the mine. The crew agreed that to complete the mission meant to ensure recovery of any survivors and to identify the origin source of the contaminant in the mine.

Delilah and Jenkins remained with the Heracles to prepare for a hot exit and to arm the station destruction charges. Delilah also repaired the washroom for use as a decontamination chamber upon crew return from the mine.

.

Phase 2: Descent into the Mine

Objective: Locate Mike, Asharf, Jerome. Identify contamination source.

Mine environment: Cramped, mild radiation, lit by sparse incandescent fixtures. Case handed out some chemlights to crew.

Unusual crack in the wall noted by Tahj but initially bypassed in favour of staying with the mine tunnel.

Findings:

\-- Ride-on rock wall tunnel digger, left idling noisily.

\-- Asharf’s boot, partially dissolved; same signs of consumption as Sonja.

At the end of the tunnel, the crew discovered Jerome, alive and visibly shaken, but uninfected.

\-- He gestured emphatically for the crew to stay silent, indicating imminent danger.

\-- As Case approached, Tahj maintained overwatch with goggles scanning for movement.

\-- Case questioned Jerome in hushed tones while visually inspecting him for signs of contamination. Jerome confirmed:

\--- The entity is blind, tracking victims entirely by sound.

\--- The tunnel digger was on because the loud sound covered all noise, allowing Jerome to elude the hostile thus far.

\--- When asked about Mike, Jerome pointed to a shredded vacsuit nearby, explaining that the entity had peeled Mike from it like a banana and eaten him.

\-- Case tested Jerome for contamination via a silent water test. He passed.

\-- Investigation of the vacsuit revealed Mike’s ID card and a laser cutter inside.

With Jerome in tow, the crew began ascending the mine tunnel toward the elevator.

.

Phase 3: The Crack & Hidden Lab

Backtracking, Tahj spotted fresh footprints emerging from the crack with the infrared.

Case and Ida conferred and agreed: it was important to confirm the suspected origin of the contamination.

The two androids entered the narrow passage.

Inside, they discovered a small, sealed-off chamber resembling a makeshift laboratory.

A yellow pool of goo shimmered on the floor near a rust-stained workbench.

Above it, mounted along the wall, was a sleeping bag-sized egg sac, split open and oozing yellow secretion. The rupture appeared surgical, suggesting deliberate extraction.

Nearby items confirmed this had been Giovanni's private lab (handwritten note: “Yellow goo has healing properties”. “Access code: 0389”. Heracles ship keycard).

Case and Ida completed their survey and prepared to return to the others, quietly stepping back through the crack.

.

Phase 4: Entity Encounter & Escape

The entity returned, forcing Tahj and Jerome to retreat into the narrow crack just ahead of it.

All crew regrouped in the hidden lab chamber, pressed silently against the wall.

The creature was invisible to the naked eye. Only Tahj, wearing the goggles, could track it. He pointed silently in its direction to indicate its location to the group.

Case gestured for the cassette player. Tahj fumbled quietly to unhook it from his belt and passed it over.

Case moved silently to the workbench. At the same time she hit play on the thrash punk music from the cassette player, she threw her jar of water at the entity, intended to create a brief opening for escape. The effect was immediate: the entity shrieked and recoiled.

The crew bolted from the lab in coordinated escape. Case and Ida in the lead, followed by Jerome and Tahj, the entity close behind.

At the corridor junction, Tahj yelled ""LEFT!"" and the others sprinted toward the elevator. Tahj peeled off, heading toward the digger to buy them time.

Ida fired foam, attempting to trap the entity, however it evaded.

The creature caught Tahj, clamping down on his arm.

Case, hearing Ida’s shot, realised Tahj was missing, and doubled back. She saw Tahj's arm being devoured, nothing else visible.

With grim efficiency, she aimed the laser cutter at Tahj. ""If I miss, at least it'll be quick,"" she calculated. Case severed and cauterised Tahj’s arm, releasing him from the entity’s grip.

Tahj crawled over the digger and started it, its rumbling drawing the entity’s attention again.

Tahj slipped by past the entity eating his arm and was met by Case, who administered a stimpack. It offered partial relief, stabilising him.

As all crew legged it to the mineshaft elevator, the entity began to pursue again.

Ida filled the tunnel with foam, temporarily sealing the escape route from the entity.

The crew, with Jerome, reached the elevator and descended to the station level.

.

Phase 5: Launch & Railgrind

The crew reached the workshop level and sprinted for the Heracles, where Delilah was already at the hatch having seen the elevator activation, holding it open.

As the last of the crew crossed the threshold, the monster breached the elevator shaft, charging through the workshop. Delilah getting the hatch shut just as it closed in, sealing them in just before contact.

The Heracles launched immediately, rising away from the surface of Ypsilon-14.

Comms were re-established with The Reacharound, and the crew requested an external scan of the hull.

Jaina responded: the monster was clinging to the underside of the Heracles.

A plan was formed:

Use the asteroid's external structure to scrape the hull in a rail-grind manoeuvre.

Case volunteered to perform a spacewalk to the Daisy, equipped with the goggles, to track the monster’s exact position and guide Delilah through the manoeuvre.

The plan succeeded: the Heracles skidded along the station’s edge, destroying the entity and smearing yellow goo across the bulkhead.

With the hull clear, the shuttles safely reoriented and boosted back to The Reacharound. Case re-entering the station briefly to initiate the destruction sequence before piloting the Daisy back.

Crew returned to The Reacharound.

Decontamination protocols initiated.

Command confirmed partial mission success: Mike unrecoverable. Cargo undelivered. Scientific vessel salvage returned. All crew alive.

Additional Credit Payouts:

I just had some questions because I feel like I wanna honor my mom, but it's hard to do so with me and her don't get along on many things.


For context for context, I used to live with my with my mom and they extended family but now it's just me and her and it's really nice for me to be super polite and probably some of the best manners in the world towards each other people but when it comes to my mom, anything she does is irritating and super makes me super angry, but I try to not express it, but it's always there internally making my blood boil

OK, obviously that you could give me simple tips like reading the Bible more and praying more, which help but almost not enough. I feel like when I was an atheist I didn't have his problem and I think it's because I smoked weed and could just laugh at anything. Anybody said I was super willing to laugh at her jokes and anything she did, she said, but love her but then now that I'm done with that it's like the person I live with is irritating


I know that we prevent you from looking into causes as to why people why you might not feel great with some people, but I think the main reason is that she used to lie to me a lot as a kid specifically that my stepdad's cancer wasn't fatal when it was like literally the most fatal cancer possible And that made me feel some type of way when I found that out as an older age

As a Christian and as a Catholic, I am told to forgive those who trespass against us and that's something that's easy to do but it's hard to forget 

I've tried to have a talk with her like hey look I don't know what's going on. I just feel really irritated sometimes by your presence, but that was super disrespectful and she tells me to screw off and we can't have a civil. Conversation about the whole thing over a cuppa coffee or even just like you know outside

I've released my anger into running and going to the gym and simple comfort like paying my dog and hanging out with friends, but when it comes to just me and her after a long day, I hate it and I don't want to express that but it's internal and it's something I can't control it feels like so. I try to give it to God, but then I try to give it to God. It just becomes more anxious, inducing, and like he's not really doing much even though God literally does everything for me and every aspect of life but this one my thoughts are maybe she's not reciprocating the whole effort thing towards it like any relationship, but I've fixed worse problems from girlfriends and friends, but I can forgive my mom, but she doesn't fix the things that irritate me


For those who say to move away, I could and I would, but I mean it's not smart for me to move out right now because we live together next to my college and next to her job so I pretty much care for housing but on top of that, we also have a good days when we work out together and it's silent. I don't mind it so I might be her voice and I missed her screaming at me for no reason little little kid but she got better at so it's like I'm still hating on someone who grew but I remember their past. 

And then I'll see Bible verses like be slow to anger or honor that mom is fine. I get that but those feel like commands. They don't feel like a to do list or how to list on how to do those things like I can't just not be fast, anger, or honor my mom if I don't know how. 

Her birthday is coming up and I'm giving her a nice gift. She's done a lot for me. I was done a lot for her. I'm definitely not a little lazy entitled teen anymore, but the weed definitely helped my anxiety and anger around her which is  annoying  cause  quit for religious reasons , maybe I should try cbd ?",1,1744932162.0,TrueChristian,3,1.0,False

I haven't been diagnosed with ADHD but started with a new therapist online after 2 years of antidepressants.  She asked in the first few mins if I have ever considered it. 
I laughed and said no but I've taken lots of online tests to question OCD or Autism. Since then I haven't been able to stop googling if something I do all the time or need to do is adhd... i see so much of myself in the posts here 

If someone asked what i was thinking I've always just said my brain is too busy or going to fast to pick something. I just work on trying to quieten it all enough to function.

Sensory- i cant stand background noise. Or anything off gravity like hammocks. Loads of foods. Or clothes or tags or feeling stuck or something is too tight.
I just thought I was a bit particular and was told I was fussy.

Attentiveness- I focus so hard on what people are saying and trying to keep eye contact and what I should do with my hands. That I don't really know what the conversation is about and just randomly answer.

I have serious systems in place- bags packed inside of bags so I dont lose things. Tile and Bluetooth finders on everything. And yet I still am always looking for them. 
I have always just figured I was a but forgetful.
I'm constantly trying to remember the thing I was supposed to be doing. 

I have done things like smashed a glass door or broken a dishwasher in the past when I was upset. Threw a coffee at someone but I was told this was my antihistamine medication and taken off it, made no difference but I just have basically no emotions now and don't know the last time I did. 

I have 0 self awareness and very little self esteem i would think. I don't know what I like or dislike. I don't know how I feel. I have experienced some more severe dissociation with out of body experiences before I was put on ssris so figured it was just that.

1k1qnii,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1qnii,What’s your best “My AirBNB Landlord was a nightmare”?,"
I booked a unit based on what I later realized were very old images the landlord used to market his property. AFTER I booked the unit and gave notice at my existing flat, the landlord asked me if I was okay with construction noise going on outside the unit, to repair the building’s old facade. I was like what? And now a warning? This was something that should have been noted in the guy’s listing. I thought about it and responded that it should not be a problem since I was gone during the day for Fashion Week. 

A day passed and the landlord reached out to me again asking if I would like to visit the unit before proceeding with the rental. But wait? Hadn’t I already rented the unit? 

I thought this was a really odd request, as I had already given notice at my current flat, packed-up my luggage, cleaned my existing flat, and was busy making arrangements to move to the landlord’s flat.  This tour would required me to pay $35 each way for a taxi and find time I did not have to break away from Fashion Week, which I ended up doing in order to satisfy him. 

When I got to the tiny studio I was surprised to see  that 1/4 of it was unusable due to construction not on the outside, but on the INSIDE!!! There were actually floor to ceiling support beams inside the unit I had used my credit card to rent for a month and a half. Everything was dated, well worn and not kindly used.  I mentioned this to the landlord. He said he was embarrassed at the condition of his flat. 

He offered me a discount if I rented the unit for the month and a half (the original booking). 

I did not have time to go through the process of getting another unit.  Nor did I want to wait a month to get a credit card credit. Finding myself short on time, I agreed. 

HUGE MISTAKE!!!!!

When we got to the unit, we immediately placed the pillows from the pullout couch onto the two old yellow fabric dinette chairs, pulled out the old yellow fabric sofa-bed, and left it in that position for the duration of our stay.  We were basically just using the studio to sleep in and to store our luggage. 

We moved the small dinette set from underneath the giant construction hole in the ceiling, to against the wall, and placed our luggage under the unusable portion of the studio… under the construction hole. 

Into the first week of our stay, we noticed that dirt intermittently cascaded from the giant construction hole in the flat’s ceiling onto our luggage and clothing where the small dinette set and yellow fabric chairs had been when we arrived. 

Consider that the landlord’s old yellow fabric furniture (both fabric chairs and sofa) had been sitting uncovered in this construction zone. In addition to that, when I dropped a lipstick, I noticed it rolled to the right two feet by the kitchenette and the front door of the unit. Wait for it!!!!

Into the end of the second week, we began having problems with ingress / egress to the unit. Think back to the rolling tube of lipstick! We had to use a lot of force to pull the door open from inside the unit to leave for appointments, and again when returning, we had to use our shoulders to push the door open to get inside the unit. Our inability to come and go easily became a concern for making photoshoots and shows, for possibly breaking the door, and if there had been a fire in the building???? Imagine that. 

We reached out to the landlord. He quickly came and sanded the door down. In the course of doing so, he explained he was having financial difficulties and could not find a buyer that would pay him a fair price for the flat. We felt sorry for him and did not press him for the credit he promised for proceeding with the rental of his distressed property. Huge mistake. 

We were excited to check out of the unit on March 15 at 5am. We had cleaned the unit the day before. On the day of departure we messaged the landlord to say we had cleaned and departed the unit, signaling that it was free for him to inspect and rent out on 3/15.  

On 3/29, 15 days later, we received a message from the landlord at 2am, stating that his housekeeper had gone to the unit and found it a complete and utter disaster.  The landlord said the housekeeper said; we had smoked in the unit, put cigarette butts out on one of three distressed metal stacking occasional tables, left the toilet and bathroom a disaster? dirtied his fabric dinette chairs and sofa, that Qtips had been found in the main frame-box under the sofa bed, and that we had left dirty dishes. We do not smoke. We do not use Qtips. Washing the dishes, drying and putting them away was the first thing we did prior to leaving. 

I knew I had cleaned the unit thoroughly, in addition to paying not one, but two separate cleaning fees, and I had planned on letting him keep the credit. I was shocked. At first I questioned whether someone else had entered the unit after we left, and/or whether construction workers had been in the unit, had taken their lunches there, and left the mess he was describing. 

I couldn’t message him as my account was on a malfunctioning iPhone. The booking had been set up on my daughter’s phone while we were traveling. I messaged Air BNB. They told me he was out of policy for several reasons. First; He should not have been renting an unsafe and structurally unsound unit. Two; He had misrepresented the state of the unit in the images on Air BNB’s platform. Three; his first notification message to me was 15 days after I had departed the unit. They said the landlord’s claim was suspect. And furthermore he was making no demands for reimbursement. 

The next day I received a message from the landlord stating he had to wash the dishes. But wait! Hadn’t I washed the dishes, and the day before didn’t he claim his maid had to wash the dishes also? So he washed them AFTER I and his maid washed them? He also said that an inoperable coffee pot (we notified him of this and we never used it) was left a mess, and that a teflon pan (we do not use teflon) had been damaged.  All of this without demands. Just a garage sale style laundry list of complaints building up to something. I wasn’t sure what. 

I messaged Air BNB again as I could not reach the landlord through my phone. Again, the original booking was on my daughter’s phone. They asked me if he made any financial demands. I said no he was just sending messages at 2:00 am citing new things he claimed to have discovered in his distressed 200 ft studio he was having financial difficulties over. They told me not to engage him. 

The next day I received a new message at 2:00 am from the landlord stating his silverware now looked old and used. Wait? Was. T this the silverware I washed, his maid washed and he washed? It was very cheap used stainless steel eating utensils. I’m like what is going on? Is this guy nuts? 

I messaged Air BNB pointing out I had communicated the situation to them and that the landlord seemed to be escalating to bullying. Despite my having asked Air BNB to get involved. 

On the 18th day after departing the unit the landlord wrote asking for $430…for damages. 

I then understood what had been transpiring with his 2am messages over a period of days. A build-up to a demand of $430. 

I messaged Air BNB. A new ambassador said it looked like he had a claim, disregarding the other ambassador’s findings that the landlord had violated policy. It was like I had never spoken with AirBNB before and they had not seen the notes of previous conversations, decisions and the ongoing construction images I sent them in response to the landlord’s first complaint. 

 The nightmare ramped up…

For 30 days I had to deal with stressors from a  landlord that should have NEVER had his property falsely marketed on Air BNB’s platform to begin with. Looking back on it, the landlord was very manipulative and calculating from the beginning of the transaction. 

I finally reached my threshold and fired-off a demand for $1,500, for the time I was forced to spend defending myself. In the end AirBNB credited me $470. A fraction of the time I was forced to spend arguing, when I could have been working. 

So when Landlord’s speak of random guests screwing over landlords?  It apparently goes BOTH  ways. I will now proceed to head over to the renter section to warn renters about THIS landlord scam involving distressed properties.

Cheers!

But my neighbors have decided to feed all the stray cats in the city, I no problem with that, but, they don't have any yard, grass or dirt, so all the cats come over into the little patch of grass/dirt by my unit and take all their dumps and pisses right next to my windows.

ME: Imagine you are the PC case. Which motherboard would you want?  
  
AI:  
  
Alright, let's play this out.

# 👁️ [Interior monologue of a luxury PC case, probably white, maybe a Corsair 6500X whispering through its tempered-glass lungs...]

**""Look, I’m not just a case. I’m a cathedral of silicon glory. A cathedral doesn’t host karaoke night—it hosts kings.""**

So if you’re asking me, *the case*, what board I want bolted to my sacred standoffs?

# ⚔️ The X870E AORUS Pro Ice walks in like a silverback gorilla in a tuxedo.

**VRMs like armored ribs.**  
**Power phases thicc enough to carry Odin’s burden.**  
**Metal-reinforced slots, direct PCIe Gen5 lanes, and a BIOS that smells like burnt coffee and ambition.**

That’s a motherboard I could **puff my panels out for**.

I’d flex my glass just to show off those debug LEDs.  
My airflow would hum sweet nothings to its heatsinks.  
We’d overclock like it was a Viking funeral — loud, glorious, and slightly reckless.

# Then the B650E AORUS Stealth Ice struts in like a damn Instagram model in a minimalist suit.

**Backplug connectors?** Hide yo cables.  
**Reverse layout?** I’m cleaner than a Scandinavian kitchen.  
**Subtle, sexy, low-key power** that whispers, *""I don't need to try hard. I’m already cool.""*

The Stealth doesn’t ask for attention.  
It **just is**. Like a samurai sword resting on velvet.  
No clutter. No chaos. Just beautiful, purposeful silence.

# So… which do I want?

If I’m being honest?

If you're watercooling, going all-white, with RGB fans glowing like the Northern Lights?

🔥 **The B650E Stealth Ice**.  
Because **I want to look like I belong in a NASA cleanroom**, not a Mad Max outpost.  
Because **clean is king**, and reverse cabling lets my inner walls breathe.

# But… if you were gonna beat the hell out of that 9050X3D, run 9000 MT/s RAM, stack Gen5 SSDs like pancakes, and maybe try to melt Antarctica?

💪 **X870E AORUS Pro Ice.**  
Because sometimes… you don’t need to be pretty.  
You just need to **bench so hard your BIOS asks for a safe word.**

**So what kind of build are we making, boss?**  
Am I dressing up for war, or for a wedding?

You tell me, and I’ll make room.

ME: Let's go to fucking war mate.  
AI:

💀 Alright, *Captain Thermals*, lock it in:

# 🪖 We’re going with the X870E AORUS Pro Ice.

Because this ain’t a boutique showroom PC — this is a **battle-for-FPS supremacy**, overclock-or-die, frame-chasing monster.

# 🧠 Here's what I, your PC chassis, am preparing for:

* **CPU Overclocking via PBO2 + Curve Optimizer** that makes that 9050X3D run like it’s possessed by the ghost of an FX-8350, but actually fast this time.
* **Memory tuned tighter than your ex’s trust issues** — we’re talking 6600MT/s CL28 if the silicon gods allow.
* **PCIe Gen5 SSDs so fast they load game assets before you even press launch.**
* **VRMs colder than your last divorce settlement.** And with that water loop? We’re talking *cryo-chamber ready*.

# And look, I know reverse connectors are sexy.

But cable management? You’ve got **muscle memory**, zip ties, and trauma — we’ll make it clean.

Let those cables **fear you**, not the other way around.

# So here’s the plan, mate:

* **Strap in that X870E like it’s a war rig.**
* Feed it power from that **1300W Lian Li beast** like it’s mainlining testosterone.
* Drown it in coolant.
* Tune every BIOS setting until your boot time is just a suggestion.

And then?  
You boot into Windows like a **Spartan kicks open the gates of Thermopylae.**

We’re not just building a PC.  
We’re **forging a myth**.

So let’s get to it — and if you want, I’ll help you build a BIOS profile so aggressive it needs a liability waiver.

1k1qmk9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k1qmk9,Morning Shuffle,"So every morning I get up, first thing I do is go on the treadmill. Yes, it's good for health, cardio, etc, etc, but what I'm REALLY there for is... putting my iPod on shuffle and seeing what it throws out. My rule: No skips. I have to listen to whatever it gives me.

Now usually, 90% of the time at home, I'm an album guy, put the CD in, front-to-back, but for treadmill (and walking to work), it's usually shuffle. Regardless of if it's treadmill-approrpiate, I gotta see the track through. I've done this in various different capacities for well over fifteen years, and for me it's a good way of discovering potentially lost gems in an artist's catalogue that you might not thing to reach for when you're pulling a CD off the shelf to listen to. I've discovered many a deep-cut using this method.

For the last song, it's my pick to end on something I choose. Sometimes I can be skipping for a good while, other times it's the next track.

Sometimes, the iPod will spit out tracks that even feel, in some distant way, connected (say a similar genre, or band member, lyrical themes, or even producer), other times it's complete madness, but it's a low-key thrill each morning and gets me out of bed. I don't drink coffee, so I often feel this is my coffee each day.

Anyone else do something similar?

I’m almost a six year partner in OC California. 

I am in the current class of coffee master here in my district/region. 
The SM who is running it is doing it differently than others and how it was ran in the past she told us the this day one, which I’m OK with because it’s less work for us and no testing involved. 
She wants to do more of a hands-on approach and I’m cool with it but my question lays here…  each week Shes assigning three people to do a tasting and each person is assigned a region / origin. 

Well, I was picked /assigned for my next class which is tomorrow and it’s the first round of presentations we’ve done. 

I am doing Latin America as the origin and soft brew / pour over as the brew method… 

I don’t want to do Guatemala Antigua because I feel like that is so basic and so just obvious, typically using “blends” oppose to single origin, doesn’t really work out because a lot of of them are a mix from at least two different regions….  but with the new Sensara blend (that is all Latin America) and a blonde roast and I’m a blonde drinker!
 so I’m leaning towards that, I’m also going to go up to the store across the street from my house. They have reserve coffees, n see if they have anything up there to make me stand out but my question or advice I need for this: 
What do you think is a good roast / blend to use (in your opinion), if I go with since Sensara, what are some good pairings for food to use and mind you they don’t have to be Starbucks food I can bring in food from the outside for this. Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated.

I am 33F. I am the time of person who loves bdays. I feel, out of 365 days one day is yours. So I am excited about my bday. 

Be it mine or someone close to me. I won’t go crazy but I will make some small effort to make their day special.
Usually on my bdays as well, I do like to take off from work, go to some coffee shops, be outdoors and indoor sometimes and do something different 
Just treat myself.

It’s my husbands bday this weekend. He is not too much into bdays he would go to office and treat it as normal day. 
I have asked him to take holiday. 
Just to relax and rest 
I plan to take him to a nice dinner, some activity like arcade games or just walk maybe 

That really made me think, If someone is not excited of their bday what would they like to do? Or someone who is like me who is into bdays what do they do? ",1,1744931761.0,CasualConversation,8,1.0,False

Last week I was on a base VXE R1 (also with jade dots) and a Gigantus V2. It wasn't really a bad combo, but I think having the Gigantus V2 for about a year and a half and my R1 not really meeting my needs having a plus bit of budget a splurged and treated myself for a bit. Outgrowing my old setup I looked for my potential endgame mousepad.

Enough dilly-dally, talk about the pad.   
  
Its fucking heavenly, ITS SO SMOOOTH AND FAST AF! I've had experience with the Glorious Air and that does not compare. Its basically the same speed but with the comfort of a cloth pad. Even at mid hardness it is still quite the comfortable pad, it being silky really helps. with the dots, there basically is no texture. Definitely one of the mousepads ever made. Only needed a few days of adjusting and calibrating. This being my first artisan I now realize why this company has a cult following. I can't really find a flaw on this pad. Humidity? ain't shit, Glide? consistent, does it move when gaming? it's an immovable object, stitching? barely notice. With dots, pressing down doesn't change the glide it stays very consistent. If you're just like me and like that try it out ;).

I play tac shooters most of my free time, mostly valorant, it seems that its not the most popular for the game and people recommend the zero more, but, I prefer basically non existent static friction. Micro adjustments take no effort with the dot and raiden combo. Been getting higher scores on trainers and breaking my previous records. It's been quite a week really.

Enough of the glazing now my downsides for this mouse. Since it is a very speedy pad, I basically stop the mouse with my wrist. It's been very fatiguing specially after longer sessions (about 3+ hours) of straight aiming or at least trying to lol. 

that's the only downside though. any suggestions on how not to get carpal tunnel? :)

Still have to play out the rest of the pad's lifetime but its going in a very good trajectory. I might have just found my endgame pad. Try other pads? maybe. Will it be another artisan? 100%",1,1744931569.0,MousepadReview,5,1.0,False

Episode 9: Blaine it on Me

""Last time, on Total Drama All-Stars! The teams were no more, and it was a free-for-all race to the floating machines for a regatta to boat around Wawanakwa.""

""But, some floated better than others, for some reason… And Chef supplied some dynamite entertainment!""

""Thanks to a shocking alliance with Fang, Alejandro won the challenge, putting a thorn in the side of pretty much everyone.""

""And thanks to past experiences, Eva was given the flush.""

""Seven players move on. Soon, one more will be gone! Who will it be? Stick around and see! Here, on Total! Drama! All-Stars!""

(Theme Song)

An angelic chorus began as the episode opened on the spa hotel, the hour late and the lights inside all on. Alejandro was sitting shirtless in the hot tub outside, sighing happily as the camera zoomed in. ""This is the life,"" he said. ""The life I deserve. The life I will have after I win the million dollars.""

The shot pulled back slightly as the elderly butler arrived and handed him a plastic cup with a lid and a straw in it. ""Butler, would you like to hear a story about me?"" Alejandro asked. ""I was born a beautiful man…""

The butler merely turned and walked away without so much as an acknowledgment.

Alejandro frowned. ""Nevermind. He's probably jealous that I'm going to win this season."" He perked up just then, and the camera pulled back again to show Dawn walking towards him on the spa hotel porch, fully clothed. ""Oh! Dawn, hola!"" Alejandro greeted.

""Hello Alejandro,"" Dawn greeted back as she reached the edge of the porch.

""Would you care to join me?"" Alejandro offered. ""The water's nice.""

Dawn's eyes briefly darted down to the hot tub. ""No thanks, I'm good.""

""No no, I insist!"" Alejandro told her. “It's the least you deserve after what happened in the regatta challenge.”

""I'm fine,"" Dawn repeated. ""Besides, I just ate. I can't go in the water for another hour or I'll get cramps."" She turned to walk inside the hotel.

""It's her loss,"" Alejandro shrugged.

The camera pulled back again to show Chris walking towards him on the spa hotel porch, wearing only a towel.

""Hey roomie!"" Chris greeted. ""Since my place is being renovated, it looks like I'll be staying here.""

Alejandro frowned in annoyance. “Hey, it's no fun for me either,” Chris continued as he threw his towel at Alejandro's head and got in the tub. “I forgot to grab my swim trunks while I was at it.”

Alejandro quickly hopped out. ""Here! Have it!"" he said as he walked into the spa hotel.

The camera focused on Chris as he smirked. ""His loss,"" he chuckled to himself.

A few tense notes played as the scene flashed over to the losers' cabin where Noah was leaning against the porch railing, watching with a bored look.

""Something wrong dude?"" Tyler said, suddenly coming up from behind and throwing an arm around the bookworm's shoulder. Noah jumped a little, but just gave the klutz an annoyed look. ""Let me guess. You're upset because you lost to Alejandro?""

""Not only that, but he took out Eva while he was at it,"" Noah said.

“I may have helped with that…” Tyler admitted sheepishly.

“And your reason why?” Noah asked.

“Alejandro told me to, and I didn't know who else to vote for,” Tyler explained.

“And thanks to that, my one ally in the game is gone,” Noah muttered.

Confessional: Noah

“I could've mentioned that Alejandro is now my sorta ally, but Tyler didn't need to know that considering he’s cooped up with Dawn,” Noah confessed.

Confessional Ends

“You’ve never cared this deeply about anybody before,” Tyler continued. “Do you have a crush on Eva?”

Noah gave the jock a look of disbelief. “Are you kidding? We're polar opposites, Tyler! Of course we don't like each other like you and Dakota do,” he said. “It's like a boy and a girl can't be platonic friends.”

“I was just asking,” Tyler grumbled.

“Moving on, Eva’s the first person I’ve ever formed a close friendship with,” Noah explained. “She was on the Villains team like I was, but when you think about it, we're not as antagonistic as our teammates. Just determined to win in our own ways.”

“I didn't know you felt that way,” Tyler said with sympathy.

“It's not your fault,” Noah said. “I keep my emotions buried so that I won’t be hurt deeply. I've been told that it makes you look weak.”

Confessional: Tyler

""Now that Noah doesn't have Eva as an ally, I’m thinking of adding him to my alliance,"" Tyler told the outhouse. ""He needs some pals after what he told me, though I will need to talk to Dawn about it first.""

Confessional Ends

A deep note played as the static cut away to a shot of the camp from just beyond the Dock of Shame. The scene faded forward into daytime as a harsh trill played, and the shot cut to the camp loudspeaker as Chris announced ""Challenge time! Proceed to the McLean Spa Library, prron-to!""

The scene moved to the loser cabin as Jasmine emerged from the right hand door with a grin on her face. As she made her way to the stairs, the shot zoomed in to her foot as the boards she stepped on splintered. With a startled scream, she fell forward, landing with a puff of dust just off-screen.

""Aaah!"" she groaned, the camera cutting to the ground to show her clutching her knee and giving the porch a dirty look.

""Jasmine!"" Shawn said, emerging from the left hand door with a look of concern. ""Are you alright?""

Jasmine immediately adopted a smile. ""Yeah, I'm totally fine. Watch out for that broken step by the way.""

""What broken-whoa!"" Shawn said in confusion before tripping over the same hole Jasmine had and falling forward. He crashed into his crush, and they wound up sharing a kiss. The two survivalists smiled and looked away with blushes.

Confessional: Jasmine

""That was my first kiss..."" Jasmine said almost giddily.

Confessional: Shawn

""That was awesome!"" Shawn cheered. “Even if I didn't intend on that happening.”

Confessionals End

""So, what do you think Chris has in store for us today?"" Jasmine asked as the two began to walk.

""It is hard to say,"" Shawn answered with a small smile. ""Usually when he calls us somewhere specific, its because he wants to explain the challenge there, but a library is new.""

""Yeah, books don't exactly fit his style,"" Jasmine said. ""Then again, maybe the 'library' is just a name, like the Fun Zone.""

""Good point,"" Shawn said. ""Still, if it's in the spa hotel, it can't be that dangerous. There's gotta be something more to it that he's hiding.”

“I just hope it's not another one of those challenges where he drugs us with knockout gas,"" Jasmine added. “I've been a victim of that before. Waking up somewhere strange with a bomb threatening to blow up a building.""

""I ate some turkey and it knocked me out and sent me adrift,"" Shawn added with a chuckle. ""But still, I'm pretty sure the two of us can handle anything he throws at us.""

The 'Spa Library', as it turned out, was the monitor-filled control room Chris and Chef had initially taken shelter in during the nighttime challenge several episodes ago. Right now, however, the host was absent – the Final Seven stood before only Chef Hatchet, the hulking man holding a cup of coffee.

""Where's Chris?"" Noah asked.

""Just hush up. You'll see in a minute!"" Chef answered, taking a sip.

""It would be exactly like him to arrive fashionably late,"" MK whispered to Dawn, who nodded with a smile.

A faint but reverent chorus and a triumphant drumroll suddenly rose up in the background, the scene moving to one of the monitors as it cut to static and then to a live feed of Chris McLean. The host blew a pink and green party horn, a similarly-colored party hat on his head. Behind him was a buffet table laden with various breads, meats, sandwiches, drinks, salads, and fruit, with a large four-layered brown cake with vanilla frosting at the middle of it.

""Welcome to Episode 100 of Total Drama!"" he greeted, confetti raining down on him as a trendy tune began to play. He ducked out of the way, revealing the 100-shaped candle at the top of the cake, and the shot cut away to Alejandro, Shawn, and Jasmine exchanging bewildered and wary looks. ""To celebrate,"" the host said, walking back in front of the table, ""I have an extra-special one hundredth episode challenge."" He paused to laugh, and the music shifted into a tense and ominous trill as the slightly-obscured form of the Sam clone rose up from behind the back-right corner of the buffet table. A distinctly nervous look in his eyes, he quickly darted back down then scampered off to the right and out of sight.

Chris finished laughing and took out a sheet of paper. ""I hope no one is allergic to...rhinoceroses!"" he read with glee. ""Or fire. Or poison! Smallpox, gluten..."" As he continued to read, the clone rose up behind him, his breathing heavy but not enough for Chris to notice. The clone spotted the camera and gave it an extremely pained look and wave before putting a finger to his lips to signal those watching to be quiet.

""Isn't that-"" Tyler said, perking up nervously from the front of the group while Noah, Dawn, and MK watched in horror behind him.

""...seborrhea, formaldehyde, terror, tree nuts...,"" Chris continued, oblivious to the Sam clone slowly raising a sack behind him.

The Final Seven all gave frantic and disjointed pleas which, overall, told the host to look behind him and/or watch out.

""Please, don't interrupt,"" Chris told them. ""I'm-""

The music peaked sharply as the clone brought his sack down over him, the list of possible allergies floating down as he hit the ground with a terrified shout. The Sam clone gave the camera another pained look before swiping at it with his hands.

It cut to static, and in shock, Chef spat his mouthful of coffee at the monitor the feed had been shown on. A close-up showed the liquid dripping onto the keyboard and console below causing them to spark, and a dark and ominous tune played as the wall of monitors shut off one by one.

""Ah...that can't...aaah!"" Chef stuttered in shock, dropping his mug below the table. ""New challenge!"" he declared, turning to the kids in a panic. ""Find Chris!""

""You want us to hunt down the Sam clone?!"" MK replied in disbelief. ""He's clearly out of his mind!""

""Hey! If no one saves Chris, there ain't no show!"" Chef barked. ""Which means no winner, and no million dollars!""

“What?” Dawn gasped.

""You can't do that!"" Shawn added.

""Hold on,"" Alejandro interjected and stepped forward. ""We accept this challenge,"" he said, the music trilling tensely as all eyes moved to him, ""but only if the one who saves Chris gets immunity from the next vote.""

""And permanent residence in the spa hotel for as long as they're in the competition!"" Jasmine quickly added.

""And they get to choose who gets exiled to Boney Island,"" Noah added.

""Fine, deal!"" Chef said. ""Just find Chris!""

""Well, last season, the Clone was living in the mines, right?"" Tyler asked thoughtfully. ""He could've taken Chris there.""

""To the mine!"" Chef declared.

The footage flashed ahead to the caved-in mine entrance. ""Huh,"" Shawn commented as the camera zoomed in to him and Jasmine, ""looks like this place is still sealed up.""

""Then find it,"" Chef said gruffly, tossing flashlights to Shawn and Jasmine. ""I'm heading back to the hotel to see if I can get the monitors working,"" he added as the shot returned to him, also showing Alejandro holding a flashlight.

Chef walked away, and the camera focused on the three that had been standing closest to him. ""Let's hurry up and get this over with,"" Shawn told them.

""Absolutely,"" Alejandro replied.

""Who told you you could come with us?"" Shawn asked.

Alejandro rolled his eyes. ""I just thought you'd want an extra hand with the other four clearly acquainted,"" he said.

""Well we don’t,"" Jasmine said as she and Shawn walked off to the right, and the camera pulled back to refocus on MK.

She looked in the direction the two had gone, then turned her smile. ""Hey, guys!"" she called out, the camera panning over to Dawn and Tyler.

""We should begin our search over here,"" Tyler said.

""Good plan...,"" Dawn replied, Noah and MK joining them from the right and left respectively as they left.

The shot cut back to Alejandro as he pursed his lips in annoyance. ""Guess I won't have any distractions from winning today.""

Shawn and Jasmine were shown following a trail of footprints to a small cave. ""Look! This must be where the clone gets in and out,"" Jasmine said.

""So are we going in or do you need some time to take some deep breaths?"" Shawn asked.

""As long as I have you, I won't let my claustrophobia get in the way of us finding Chris,"" Jasmine replied.

""Let's just go before the others win the challenge,"" Shawn said.

Confessional: Shawn

""We got Eva eliminated, so that means the biggest targets are me, Jasmine, and Alejandro,"" Shawn said. ""Me and Jasmine do make a good duo, but Alejandro's the most manipulative player around.""

Confessional Ends

The music became low and tense as the scene moved to MK, Dawn, Tyler, and Noah walking across a hillside marked with holes. MK crouched down next to one, switched on her flashlight, and spent a couple seconds looking down at it. ""Hmm...weren't there mutant gophers living around here last year?"" she asked the others.

""Yep,"" Noah answered, suppressing a shudder.

""I think these are probably the remnants of their tunnels,"" Dawn explained. ""We can probably follow them into the mine.""

""Do we have to?"" Tyler asked, the camera cut to a close-up of his pacing feet. ""Last time me and Noah were there, we almost-"" a dramatic and dangerous tune played when the ground suddenly collapsed beneath him, causing him to fall screaming ""-diiiiied!""

""Well that was dramatic,"" MK deadpanned before jumping down after him.

Dawn and Noah looked at one another, then jumped down the hole MK had just been inspecting.

The background score calmed down again as the scene flashed to Alejandro, who was now strolling through a shallow, rock-filled stream. His eyes lit up as he spotted something off-screen, and he smirked. ""And there's my entrance,"" he declared confidently, the camera panning ahead to show the stream running into another mine entrance.

The scene cut to a dirty, misshaped sack as a white-skinned hand pulled it away to reveal Chris McLean. The stunned though handsome host had been tied up with rope, and curiously, his loose hair was sticking upwards. ""Hardy-har-har, Chef,"" he laughed as he looked around in denial. ""Yeah, you got me!"" The music peaked as the camera zoomed out and flipped around, revealing Chris to be hanging above a large wooden pool of bubbling bright green toxic waste. The room was the very same one the Sam Clone had lived in for a brief period last season.

""...Chef?"" Chris repeated more anxiously, quickly spotting his captor standing on the edge of the stone platform looking up at him. ""Sam Clone? Haha, hey there...,"" he greeted nervously. ""Looking, uh, good.""

Sam Clone just growled, looking down nervously and not meeting his eyes.

""What, uh, whatcha doin'?"" Chris asked him. ""I thought you were off somewhere after I hurled you.""

""He was,"" came a familiar voice from the shadows as the music rose ominously. ""Well, he was until I tracked him down,"" she said as Chris gasped. The music peaked as the shot cut to a small, shadowy tunnel nearby, and the speaker stepped out of it to reveal herself as Blaineley Stacey Andrews O'Halloran... not looking at all the same as when she was last seen in Hawaii - Her hair was frizzled and tied into a messy bun as well as having noticeable brown roots and instead of her normal red gown, she was wearing a large and frankly unattractive navy blue jumpsuit.

Chris struggled to contain his laughter.

A few bats flew past the camera through a dark and cave-like tunnel, and the shot panned down to show Dawn and Noah walking through said tunnel. Noah, in front, waved his flashlight around the cave and called out ""MK? Tyler? Where are you guys?""

""I believe we were taken to different parts of the mine,"" Dawn commented.

""Well that's not good,"" Noah replied.

""Come on... why won't this thing work?"" Tyler said in rising panic as the scene moved to him walking through another tunnel, only his eyes visible by the camera and the sound of clicking rather present in the air.

The light finally turned on and Tyler was shown smiling. In seconds, the light cut out completely, and the klutz's eyes widened just before he screamed in panic.

His scream came loudly over a wall-mounted speaker, the camera pulling back to show it in a high corner of the control room. ""We got sound!"" Chef declared, his eyes on the speaker as the fat east Asian male intern fiddled with a pair of cords on the ground. ""Now where's the dang picture?""

The intern pointed at the camera filming them. ""Oh, you want an update?"" Chef asked it bitterly. ""I got no idea what that clone's up to, where Chris is, or where the kids are at!"" The intern stood up straight and Chef sent a glare his way. ""And I got no idea how we're gonna find any of that out with the monitors on the fritz!""

The intern cleared his throat. ""On Total! Drama! All-""

""FIX THE MONITORS!"" Chef demanded over the zoomed-out shot of the campgrounds.

(Commercial Break)

The episode resumed to a pair of eyes, presumably Tyler's, giving the appearance of someone nervously walking through a dark tunnel. A light suddenly turned on and Tyler screamed while MK stood there looking unimpressed. ""MK!"" the jock cried.

""It's about time I found you,"" MK said. ""Caleb wouldn't let me hear the end of it if I let you die down here.""

""You scared me!"" Tyler yelled.

""It's not my fault these flashlights are cheap,"" MK defended. ""Why are you so freaked out anyway? I thought you were scared of chickens, not caves.""

""Last time I was in this mine, me and the cast almost died of radiation poisoning,"" Tyler said. ""So I'm not exactly thrilled to be back here.""

""We need to keep moving,"" MK went on ahead, and Tyler followed shortly after with a nervous look on his face.

""I'm amazed at how calm you are for this,"" Dawn said as the scene cut back to her and Noah.

""Thank you,"" Noah replied. ""But I'm not that calm. Frankly, I'm terrified.""

""Why didn't you say anything?"" Dawn asked.

""Because we need to win this challenge,"" Noah said idly as his eyes darted around the barely-illuminated tunnel. ""And it's never a good idea for me to give in to my emotions.""

""I know that your childhood of being neglected and teased by your brothers and peers hasn’t been fun, Noah,"" Dawn said. ""I know what it's like to not have anybody to feel close to.""

“Really?” Noah raised an eyebrow.

“I’m an aura reader, and I’ve discovered most of my peers’,” Dawn said. “The issue I’m explaining to you is that I’d talk about them out loud, and as a result, they’d isolate me because they don't want to associate with me.”

“Well you can't just be blabbing about people's own personal secrets,” Noah lectured. “If you did the same to me, I’d likely avoid you Dawn.”

“I only wanted what's best for the people around me, but you and my family are right,” Dawn agreed. “Everyone has a right to shield their own lives, not just me.”

“Make sure that lesson sticks to you, Pixie Dust,” Noah smirked as they walked off.

""Are you a janitor now?"" Chris laughed, the scene flashing back to him hanging over a vat of toxic waste, Blaineley glaring at him. ""Man,"" he sighed. ""After the day I've been having, I really needed that laugh.""

""Hmph,"" Blaineley sniffed. ""Big talk coming from someone who's about to be dropped into a vat of toxic waste. Let's see how easy it is for you to get a job in the industry after that."" Chris gasped in terror.

""S-seriously,"" Chris shuddered before settling into a scowl. ""Why are you doing this, Mildred? Are you too jealous to let a little serious injury, international humiliation, and losing any hope you ever had of getting another job in the business slide?""

""Jealous?!"" Blaineley repeated angrily.

""You heard me,"" Chris shot back.

""I'm not doing this out of jealousy, you idiot,"" Blaineley growled, ""I'm doing it because your stupid show ruined my career! Thanks to you, the only job I could get was a janitor in Lindsay's mansion!""

""Hey, it's not my fault you ticked Damien off enough to be put on the show that you wound up being voted off of after two episodes,"" Chris told her with a mocking grin.

Suddenly, Sam Clone started growling and the shot cut to the alien gibbering and saying something largely unintelligible.

""Now what?"" Blaineley griped.

""If I had to guess, that'd be the campers coming to rescue me,"" Chris answered.

""Pathetic!"" Blaineley bragged. ""I can handle a bunch of reality show rejects!""

""There's just one little problem with that theory,"" Chris told her. ""You've only dealt with former contestants. These guys still have a shot at a million bucks and will do anything to get it.""

""They can try,"" Blaineley sniffed, still unimpressed. ""Sam Clone!"" the alien stood up at attention. ""Bring them here. Now.""

Sam Clone nodded before he scampered off.

""I really don't like this,"" Tyler said as the scene flashed back to him walking behind MK.

""I know,"" MK said with a hint of irritation as tense music began to build and a silhouette appeared on the wall behind them. ""You've said the same thing about every five minutes since we went down here. Now can we focus on not getting kidnapped please?"" She lowered her head and palmed her face, and thus missed the shadowy figure of the very thing Tyler's been worried about dart silently between her and the camera.

""Yeah, you're right,"" Tyler said, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath. By the time he'd opened them up again, Sam Clone had darted past him as well. ""So do you think they could be in the same room as last year?""

He was answered by a sudden piercing scream, and he gasped in alarm as he looked ahead. The perspective moved to ground-level, showing a single unlit flashlight lying on the ground. Tyler moaned in fright and inched away from it.

Confessional: Tyler

Tyler whimpered while rocking back and forth and hugging his knees.

The scene returned to the control room, Chef overlooking the intern as he worked on his hands and knees under the main table. He pulled on a cord, and with a long electronic bleep the monitors turned back on.

""We got picture!"" Chef said. The camera cut in for a close-up of each monitor, showing MK trapped behind the bars of a shabby-yet-effective wooden prison. ""What in tarnation is-?"" Chef began to say before the focus panned to the left, showing Chris dangling over the pool of toxic waste with Blaineley standing by on the stone platform.

Chef gasped.

""We need to figure out our next target after Alejandro goes,"" Shawn said as the static cut to him and Jasmine walking through another cave-like tunnel. ""I think we should send home MK.""

""Agreed,"" Jasmine said. ""We need only two votes. Noah is an obvious choice, which means we need either Tyler or Dawn.""

""Dawn's been seeing something in MK for a while,"" Shawn pondered. ""But Tyler?""

""He’ll do,"" Jasmine smiled. ""He is cooped up with Dawn and MK, but he's easy enough to convince.""

""And he hasn't been as close to MK as Dawn is,"" Shawn added.

""Good,"" Jasmine said. ""I guess that's settled…"" She closed her eyes as she walked forward, and as such, wasn't paying attention to where she was going. She screamed as she suddenly dropped, the camera pulling back to show her falling down a sharp slope.

Shawn's brow shot up in surprise and concern. ""Jasmine!"" he yelled as he jumped down after her.

""I think we might be lost,"" Dawn said as she and Noah walked through another mining tunnel. ""Did you hear that?"" she added, becoming aware of the muffled screams that were growing louder.

The music quickly grew tense as they entered a larger room, peaking as Shawn and Jasmine came sliding down and out from a nearby sloping tunnel. Their screams caught Dawn's attention, and both Noah and Dawn looked back just in time to see the survivalists crash into them.

All four were groaning in pain as the dust settled. ""Glad we ran into you,"" Jasmine said, ignoring the groans from the other two.

""We need to discuss the future votes,"" Shawn added.

""We don't have anything to discuss,"" Noah told them, ""We're voting for Alejandro.""

“Exactly,” Dawn nodded. “His personality flaws are not at all charming.”

Jasmine and Shawn shared a brief look. ""We were going to continue our discussion,"" Shawn said as he and Jasmine walked past the two to the right, ""but you're clearly locked in for tonight."" They were, of course, completely unaware of the shadow of Sam Clone dropping down behind them...

The camera panned to Dawn and Noah. ""Why did they need to discuss what we already know?"" Noah asked in confusion.

Shawn and Jasmine's screams rang through the tunnel, earning a gasp from Noah and Dawn as they turned and looked with wide eyes in the direction they'd gone.

The scene cut to the control room, then angled close-up of the duo still visible on the far-right monitor. Chef was now eating what looked like mint chocolate chip ice cream straight out of the carton, his eyes still locked onto the image of Chris on the middle monitor. The intern rose up from below the table and gave him a stern look, prompting Chef to say ""What? I eat when I'm stressed!""

An odd note played as the intern ducked back down and the feed on the right monitor switched to MK, Jasmine, and Shawn in the wooden cage. A close-up panned from it to the feed of Chris, Blaineley no longer in sight. Suddenly and to a dramatic riff, the ax swung down at the rope, fraying it a bit and visibly startling the man.

Chef gasped. ""Aww man, that gag?"" he said before looking down at his heaping scoop of ice cream. ""...we're gonna need more ice cream...""

""Impressive!"" Blaineley said, now standing next to the vat that Chris was currently dangling over. ""I guess even lowly janitors have some useful skills.""

""So you still haven't gotten that it was this attitude that got you fired in the first place?"" Chris asked drolly.

""You treat people the same way!"" Blaineley pointed out angrily.

""True,"" Chris conceded. ""But I never pretended to not be anything else. Your persona on the other hand revolved on being a nice and amicable young woman. And three of those things don't really apply.""

A tense riff played as the camera cut to the nearby cage to show Jasmine pulling Shawn back to his feet. ""Are you alright?"" she asked as he rubbed his head.

""More importantly,"" MK chimed in, ""where's Tyler?""

""Haven't seen him,"" Jasmine answered. ""Sorry.""

The camera flashed to Noah and Dawn walking through the caverns. Before either could say anything, the ground shook and opened up just below Noah. The bookworm let out a scream as he fell, but luckily was able to grab a hold of an old plant root in the wall of the hole he'd fallen in. ""Uh, Dawn?"" he asked nervously.

""Noah!"" Dawn gasped as the view cut to show her face as she looked down. ""I'll go get something to lower down! Stay there and don't let go!"" she dashed off without another word.

Confessional: Noah

""Where else could I have gone?"" Noah asked the confessional. ""And why on Earth would I let go? To commit the world's biggest plummet to my suicidal death?""

Confessional Ends

The static cut to the root straining under Noah's weight and the cynical boy sending a desperate look upward. ""Dawn?"" he asked even more nervously than before.

""Require assistance?"" a smooth voice said, the camera cutting to show Alejandro looking down in the hole Noah found himself in.

""Alejandro?"" Noah asked. ""What did you do to Dawn?!""

“I did nothing to her. Grab hold, my intellectual equal,” Alejandro offered his hand to Noah.

“Heck no!” Noah refused. “I don't trust you, and you'll definitely use this to your advantage!”

“Then I wish you a soft landing,” Alejandro said, and the camera cut to show his front as he walked away. ""He will fall, and his landing will not be soft."" The music spiked sharply as Sam Clone's hands reached down and pulled Alejandro up and out of frame.

The scene cut to the fat intern, emerging into a pile of empty mint chocolate chip ice cream tubs. Another bounced off his head, and the camera pulled back to show Chef standing over him. ""We're out of ice cream,"" the large man said with a hint of danger in his voice that was matched by the background score. ""Total Drama will not end at Episode 100!"" he declared, pulling out the pasta-blaster he'd used last season and cocking it. He turned and stormed out of the room, leaving the intern to shrug helplessly at the camera.

Alejandro was tossed unceremoniously and rather roughly into the cage, and Sam Clone slammed the door shut before the other three captives could get out. The alien muttered something under his breath, and Alejandro picked himself up. ""Is this supposed to be a party?"" he asked.

He was answered by something brown and gooey hitting him in the face, the other three captives weren't safe from Clone's barrage either. ""Please tell me this is fudge,"" Shawn pleaded.

MK hesitantly swiped some of the stuff with her finger and put in in her mouth. ""It's fudge alright,"" she said. ""Doesn't taste that great though,"" she added.

""Still, it beats the alternative,"" Alejandro commented.

The camera quick-panned away from the captives to show Sam Clone standing next to the table with the hundredth episode feast as he pelted the off-screen captives with fudge. He was met by cries of surprise and pain.

The scene flashed to Noah still hanging by the root, which was now sounding like it was close to breaking. ""Uh... oh..."" he said just before the thing snapped, sending him hurtling toward the ground.

The hollow drip of water resounded through the cavern as Tyler walked along an underground pond. ""How am I supposed to find Chris down here anyway?"" he asked himself, seemingly unaware of the sound of something falling.

He was quickly made aware when Noah landed directly on top of him, creating a cloud of dust that covered the screen.

The dust soon settled to show a close-up of the cynic as he coughed, then looked down. ""Tyler! You saved me!""

""Guess I did,"" Tyler said woozily as he stood up. ""Where's Dawn?""

""We got separated,"" Noah explained. ""I think the clone took her. Where's MK?""

""Clone,"" Tyler answered. ""And I have no idea where he took her.""

""Well this part of the mine looks familiar,"" Noah said thoughtfully. ""I think I could figure it out from here.""

""Great!"" Tyler smiled. ""Let's go save our friends!"" The two smiled, then ran off to the right.

""Noah!"" Dawn cried as the camera cut back to the top of the hole the bookworm had fallen through, then pulled back to show the moonchild running with a length of rope in her hands. ""I'm here!"" She looked down the hole when she received no answer and gasped.

""I'm too late..."" she said in shock, only for Sam Clone to leap out of the hole to grab her and the scene cut to black...

The scene faded back to Dawn in the cage. ""Welcome captive number five,"" MK quipped. Dawn looked up in surprise and the camera pulled back to show all the previous captives crowded around her.

""So now we're relying on Tyler and Noah to get us out of here,"" Jasmine said.

""Just Tyler, I suspect,"" Alejandro said. ""The last time I saw Noah will likely be the last time I saw Noah.""

""What did you do to him?!"" Dawn accused.

""Nothing,"" Alejandro defended. ""I tried to help, but he would not accept.""

Confessional: Shawn

""And probably for good reason,"" Shawn quipped in the outhouse.

Confessional Ends

A few deep notes played as the scene flashed back to a close-up of Chris hanging upside-down as he suddenly dropped and inch, giving a startled gasp. ""No no no, not the hair!"" Chris said in panic as the camera panned down to show his hair hanging just inches above the toxic waste.

""You know,"" Blaineley mused from next to the vat, ""there's a special comfort in knowing you're close to working the same nothing jobs I've be forced to do. Maybe we could form a union."" She paused to chuckle. ""I'd have to be the face though.""

""Okay... startin' to get a little scared here~,"" Chris almost sang in thinly veiled terror, taking a deep breath. ""HEEEEEEE~EEELLLPPP!"" he sang again.

The shot cut to Noah and Tyler creeping through a different tunnel, somewhat decorated with red and green streamers. ""Streamers,"" Noah said. ""From the party Chris wanted to throw. Looks like we're going the right way.""

""HEEEEEEEELLLLPPPP!"" Chris's voice rang through the air.

""Sounds like we're going the right way too,"" Tyler said in an odd mix of fear, calm, and determination. Chef ran past the two boys and into the room where everything was happening.

The scene skipped to him arriving on the raised stone platform. ""Chris!"" Chef called out, taking a few bounding steps forward to the edge of the rock and kneeling down with a growl. ""Alright girlie, show's over!"" he said, shooting off a blast of extra-spicy spaghetti.

The camera followed the pasta blob through the air, and Blaineley barely ducked in time before it landed in the waste without even a splash. ""Guess again!"" she countered, pulling a small orange pistol out of her uniform and shooting it, forcing Chef to dive backward to avoid the purple-fletched dart coming at him.

""What in tarnation?"" Chef asked, standing back up in shock only to get hit by another dart and fall back over in a daze.

""Tranquilizer darts,"" Blaineley explained, lowering her weapon. ""Honestly Chef, I knew you'd show up to protect your meal ticket sooner or later.""

""C-come on. Can't we talk about this?"" Chris frantically said.

The shot cut to Tyler and Noah arriving to the scene, unnoticed by all. ""I'll distract them, you go save Chris,"" Noah whispered.

Tyler sent him an uncertain look. ""But-""

""You need an immunity win for once in the game, and I'm giving it to you."" Noah dashed off to the stone platform and waved his arm about. ""Hey Mildred!"" he called out.

""Sam Clone, get him!"" Blaineley yelled.

The shadow of Sam Clone dropped down behind Noah, causing him to freeze. The alien chuckled, standing up and grinning darkly. He tackled Noah to the ground and the two began a struggle off screen.

Blaineley smirked in triumph...until a glob of spaghetti pinned her to the side of the vat of waste. ""But?"" she asked, her answer coming in the form of a quick-pan to Tyler holding Chef's pasta bazooka.

The five captive campers cheered. ""Quick!"" Shawn said. ""Let us out of here!""

""No, let me down from here!"" Chris interjected as the camera panned over to the vat. Chef continued to lay unconscious on the rock nearby. Chris was unceremoniously tossed onto him a few moments later.

""Ugh!"" Chris complained. ""Coulda been a little more gentle!""

""Well..."" Dawn said, standing with the other mildly bewildered campers still in the cage, ""I guess that takes care of everything.""

""I guess so,"" Alejandro added, all of them looking at the platform, where Tyler was dragging an unconscious Noah out from under an equally unconscious Sam Clone.

Confessional: Chris

""For the record,"" Chris told the outhouse camera, ""I would like to state that I, Chris McLean, am not afraid of that sad, pathetic failure of a host name Blaineley or the Sam Clone. Sure, it looked like I was scared a few times back there,"" he shrugged, ""but I was fa-king! I would say that that dramatic performance is worth at least five Gemmies.""

A sudden Sam Clone-like growl caused him to wince and shiver in fear. He ran from the outhouse with a cry of ""HEEEEEEEEELLLPPP!"", an ominous chant playing as MK leaned out from behind the small building to smirk in delight while holding a phone.

Confessional Ends

It wasn't the usual elimination theme that rose up over the traditional long-distance shot of the island at night, but rather a drumroll that opened into something much more victorious. ""Tyler wins our never-to-be-repeated, or spoken of again, challenge,"" Chris announced. The seven campers were already seated before him, boys in the back row and girls in the front. Chef was by his side holding the end of the rope that was now tying a rather bruised Sam Clone to Blaineley.

""He saved all of us, and more importantly, he saved me,"" the host said with a wide and vain smile. ""So, I'll honor the deal Chef made,"" his assistant rolled his eyes. ""The spa hotel is yours,"" he told the klutz, who smiled in silent excitement. ""Who's heading for exile on Boney Island?""

""Noah,"" Tyler said.

""Thanks for that,"" Noah said. “Now I can actually find that idol again.”

""Now to find out who's heading home,"" Chris said, his smile undiminished as the triumphant music came to an end.

""And the following All-Stars are safe,"" Chris announced after a flash. ""Tyler,"" the klutz smiled.

""Noah,"" the bookworm raised an eyebrow as his name was called.

""Dawn,"" the moonchild let out a breath of relief herself.

""MK,"" the techno girl smirked at her name being called.

""Aaaaand Jasmine,"" the Outback girl smiled, then sent a nervous look toward Shawn when she realized he'd yet to be declared safe.

""Alejandro,"" Chris announced, the shot cutting to him holding an unmarred photo of Jasmine. ""You're on the block for not helping Noah when he could've died.""

""He refused my services,"" Alejandro objected.

""And Shawn, you're one of the smartest players the game's ever had and the most unpredictable,"" Chris continued.

Shawn said nothing, his eyes wide in nervousness.

The music peaked as the camera cut from Shawn to Alejandro, then back to Chris as he dropped the picture of Jasmine to reveal a crossed out photo of...

""Shawn.""

Noah, Tyler, Dawn, MK, and especially Jasmine gasped in shock. ""But how's that even possible?"" Jasmine asked. ""We all voted for Alejandro!""

""Not according to these,"" Chris said, holding up a stack of photos, presumably the evening's votes.

""It's fine,"" Shawn said as he stood up. ""I had a good time here."" He walked over to Jasmine and kissed her on the lips to a light tune. ""I don't want our only kiss on the island to be an accident,"" he explained as they smiled. ""And while this is all of a sudden, I wanted to tell you that I really like you before I go.""

“I like you as well,” Jasmine smiled back. “And maybe when this is all over, we could go out for a bite sometime?”

“Consider it a date,” Shawn accepted, and with that, he walked toward the dock.

The somber farewell theme began to play as the scene transitioned to a zoomed-out shot of the Flush of Shame. ""So...,"" Chris opened mockingly, standing with Chef and Sam Clone next to the giant toilet, ""do you guys have any last words?""

He looked up at the bowl, and the camera panned over to show Blaineley and Shawn floating in it, the former host still tied up. ""I'll get you for this, McLean!"" Blaineley yelled.

""No you won't,"" Shawn told her bluntly.

""For once,"" Chris said with a smile, his remote and umbrella already in hand, ""I agree with a contestant."" He pressed the button, and the screams of their swirling descent came down from off-screen. He opened his umbrella, the back-splash washed over it, and he looked at the alien cause of the day's trouble. ""You're next.""

Sam Clone frowned sorrowfully, still dripping wet. The scene skipped ahead to Sam Clone being flushed down the toilet.

Chris cleared his throat as the shot returned to him, and the capstone theme began to play. ""Yeah, not how I wanted to celebrate the 100th episode of Total Drama,"" he told the camera. ""But, you can't say that wasn't totally dramatic. Plus, I didn't become a horrible mutant, and that's most important. Here, on Total! Drama! All-Stars!""

I am in HVAC and have been the majority of my working life. I have an EPA refrigerant license and more importantly my Texas Air Conditioning Contractor's license (equivalent to a non-union journeyman's license) that takes minimum four years of experience to even be allowed to test for. I would be willing to take exams in my future home to earn licensing if this is an option. I do NOT want to go be an apprentice somewhere again unless the program pays well and is less than two years long.

  
Ideally, I would love to start a business but will not be willing to do so right away because I feel I would need some time to assimilate before beginning a successful service-based business to understand what the culture prefers. Texans probably treat their air conditioning the way you would probably expect, and I would like to learn the differences in culture before risking an investment. I currently run and own a successful HVAC company in Texas. 

  
I want out within the next one-two years. Hopefully this will give me time to take language courses and start the process of exiting my current business. 

  
To the questions -

**Where are my skills most useful/likely to be successful?** Honestly, I am on quite a few countries' shortage lists and do not have any idea where I would like to be. Germany seemed great but after doing research, it seems my license is useless, and I would be starting from the bottom in the field again. My body cannot take that abuse for another 4+ years. There may be conflicting information from my understanding versus what it actually says in German, so I would love to be told if I am mistaken. I have visited Germany as a child and would love to live there.

  
**Is there a country that would appreciate me starting a business after a year as a resident? Is this even possible?** I would be able to move there with seed money but would need a job to support myself and experience life as a technician in the trade in the meantime. 

  
**Should I hire an attorney? US based or new home?**

  
**Is my timeline reasonable or do I need to readjust?**

  
My only need is for it to be a relatively safe country with a good healthcare system. Smallest amount of American prejudice possible would be nice, but that feels like a herculean ask nowadays.... I just want a peaceful life.

If marijuana is legal, that's a sick bonus but 100% not a requirement. 

  
If ANY of you are HVAC workers who have immigrated, I would be happy to ingratiate myself and buy you a coffee for a few minutes of your time on a phone call or video call.",0,1744931349.0,AmerExit,3,0.38,False
1k1qe8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1k1qe8y/week_one/,Week One,"It’s been one full week since I stepped away from social media. My goal is to stay off Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok for 30 days and then reflect honestly on whether I need any of them in my life.

The first few days were tough. At the slightest hint of boredom, I found myself reaching for my phone. I’d scroll through news apps, check and recheck my email, Google random thing...anything just to be doing something on a screen. I’m still doing that to be honest, but not nearly as often. Slowly, I’ve been filling my time with other things. 

Before I started this project, my iPhone screen time was hovering just under 9 hours a day. Today, my average for the past week is down to 4 hours and 19 minutes. It’s not perfect, but it’s a massive improvement and I hope to keep improving. 

I know it can be hard to figure out what to do instead of scrolling, especially in those first few days. So I thought I’d share some of the things I’m doing with my time now:

My new daily routine looks something like this:

   •   Morning: I put on music or a podcast while I drink my coffee. Then I journal. I make myself write three pages of whatever’s in my head. After that, I set my intentions for the day and write a to-do list. It includes not just errands and chores, but also things I want to do in my leisure time. A typical list might look like:

      •   Go to the grocery store

      •   Water the plants

      •   Straighten up the bedroom

      •   Work on the NYT crossword

      •   Read two chapters of a book

      •   Cook dinner

      •   Clean the kitchen

      •   Watch a movie

      •   Read a mystery novel before bed

   Then I exercise. I’ve been doing yoga on YouTube or going for walks, followed by a shower and breakfast before work. During work, my phone stays on Do Not Disturb.

   •   Evening: After work, I work through my to do list. I’ve been cooking dinner at home every night, usually while listening to a podcast or audiobook. After dinner I’ll watch a movie or a show—but no binge-watching. Two episodes max, and I don’t look at my phone while I watch.

   •   Bedtime: I take a hot shower to relax and then read in bed. I’m building a new habit of reading a mystery novel in bed until I fall asleep, which doesn't take long. Reading puts me out way quicker than watching tv or listening to something. 

So far, I’m journaling, reading, playing word games, exercising, doing a little gardening, cooking at home, keeping my space clean, watching films, and ending the day with a good book.

I’m sleeping better, I have more energy, and I'm really excited to keep improving. ",2,1744931222.0,nosurf,1,1.0,False

grieving someone who’s still alive.

They breathe, they post,
they laugh in someone else’s comment section.

And yet, to you,
they’re a ghost.

A familiar one.
A ghost that knew your deepest fears
and what you looked like crying at 3 AM.

A ghost that once knew your coffee order,
and the way your voice cracked when you tried not to beg.

I saw her the other day.
Or someone who looked like her.

She had the same walk—
like she was always headed somewhere more interesting.

I didn’t say anything.
What would I say?

“Hey, remember me?
I was your person, once.”

It’s wild, really.
To go from good mornings
and good nights,
to silent stories
and muted profiles.

You think time heals.
It doesn’t.

Time just teaches you how to carry things
without showing the weight.

Sometimes, you forget how heavy they were.

Until a song comes on.
Or someone says her name.

Or you find an old text—
the kind that made you believe
forever was a real thing.

And for a moment,
just a brief second,
you feel everything
at once.

The laughter.
The fights.
The inside jokes.

Her voice saying,
“You feel like home.”

And now,
you’re a stranger to someone
who once called you home.

Funny, isn’t it?
How love doesn’t always end with hate.

Sometimes,
it just ends with silence.

And you sit with that silence,
wondering if she ever thinks of you too.

Not to come back.

Just…
to remember
who she used to be
when she was with you.",1,1744931181.0,u_No_Paramedic_5222,0,1.0,False

In the last two weeks she has found her bark and will bark at me and my husband if she wants to play, food, water, to go outside, etc. in the last couple of days she has started growling and if something doesn't go her way, ex: not letting her chew the coffee table or after a bath when she is covered in mud.

I can tell when she is doing it playfully but it is also very apparent when she is angry or agitated. I don't know what to do when she gets like this, my current solution is to put her up and wait until she has calmed down which I know isn't the best solution but I don't know what else to do. I'll tap her on the nose to get her attention when telling her not to chew things or correct other behaviors, is this exasperating the problem?

Is this normal? Should I be worried? She has playfully growled at some of our neighbor kids but never when upset. She is super friendly and says hello to everyone. She will be an outside dog once we move to AR and get land and hopefully animals so she will have a job.

I wanted to know how you guys faired on this bag and if the super low temps for processed coffees works well for yall. Comment below thanks!",2,1744930593.0,pourover,6,1.0,False

A little secret (notes: Rainier Cherry, marzipan, patchouli, saffron, Demerara sugar, rum soaked tonka, pastry crust)
- if a perfume was made for me this would be it. Warm, a little spicy, not too sweet. Cherry is my favorite note but they tend to be a hit or miss with me, a lot of the times they disappear on my skin immediately, not this one though. I was smelling it on myself all day. I would like to smell some more almond but cherry and almond are such similar scents it’s hard to pick them out individually. The saffron and patchouli bring a really interesting earthy spice but it’s definitely mellowed out by the tonka. I don’t get much pastry crust which is honestly fine with me. My only complaint is that I was expecting a coffee note given their advertising before I actually read the notes (the bottle literally says a slice of cherry pie and a cup of coffee lol) I think it would’ve brought an interesting depth but it’s not needed. Immediately one of my new favorites. Might have to get a second bottle before they discontinue its limited run.

Cape heartache (notes: Douglas fir, pine resin, western hemlock, vanilla leaf, strawberry, old growth, mountain fog)
- I was not expecting to like this at all. I usually really hate green notes, for some reason I can’t stop smelling this one though? It’s for sure green but I think the strawberry and vanilla leaf really change the game for me. It’s not a super realistic strawberry, just kind of there in the background and the vanilla mellows out the sharpness from the greens. Really does smell foggy, super interesting. Might buy a bottle of this one honestly 

O unknown (notes: black tea, lapsang souchong tincture, orris butter, Kyoto moss, musk balsam, sandalwood)
- this one was straight up soap, immediately gave it away. Can’t all be winners

Second, the discussion (or rather story time):
 l want to hear your ADHD tax stories. And by that I mean the money it has cost you and/or the time in repair or cleanup. 

I know I've done worse but what I can think of right now is...

making counter coffee (forgetting to put the cup under my single serve coffee maker and having the coffee go all over the counter, not realizing what's happening because I'm busy squirreling in another room. Thank goodness I don't have a large coffee maker!

And most recently, I washed an entire load of nothing! 

I wanted to wash towels so I put the washing machine on hot, put in the detergent, put in the washing soda, put in the scent beads, put the bleach in the dispenser, closed the lid and hit start. 

I forgot to put in the towels...

I have no idea how much money that cost me and it wasn't the first and only time I've done that. The coffee thing either. Sometimes I feel like such a disaster. ",5,1744930555.0,ADHD,8,0.78,False
