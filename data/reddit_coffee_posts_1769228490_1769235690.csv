1qlfdjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1qlfdjs/just_wait_rant/,"""Just wait...."" Rant","I know we've all had our fair share of these comments but I've had more than usual this week and the next person just might get punched in the face. 😆

Currently 30 weeks pregnant & I've had pregnancy insomnia pretty much since week 12. I wake up at midnight, then 2-3am and then lay there until my husband gets up for work at 5:30. At which point I just go ahead and wake up because my usual time for work is getting up at 6:15.

So, yeah don't tell me how 'tired' I will suddenly be when the baby comes and I ""can't sleep through the night"". 🙄

Also: \*\*Trigger warning\*\* - I lost my first pregnancy at 24 weeks due to genetic issues. Most of the people saying these 'just wait..' comments are aware of this. So like, just wait until my healthy baby comes?? Yeah, sounds horrible, Debbie. 🙄 Read the room. 

I think we could all use some positivity so...

I thought I'd compile a list of some of the things that I just CAN'T WAIT for:

\- The sciatica and SI pain I've had since week 20 that makes side sleeping and walking super \*fun\* will finally go away

\- I can see my baby's cute face a cuddle him instead of constantly worrying if he's okay and not knowing for sure.

\- I can drink more coffee again! And can eat whatever I want without worrying if I'm going to give my son some food-borne illness by mistake. 

\- No more constant heartburn

\-Wearing normal clothes again without feeling like everything is constantly too tight

\-Being able to breathe and not feel like all my organs have been shoved up into my throat. 

\-Being able to put on shoes and socks without holding my breath or feeling like a T-Rex with tiny arms. 

\-Having childbirth behind me and done with so it's not constantly looming in the distance.

TLDR:  
What about you ladies? What's on your just CAN'T WAIT list? 🙂",1,1769235431.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False
1qlfdh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qlfdh2/i_left_my_barn_cat_outside_and_it_is_my_biggest/,"I left my barn cat outside, and it is my biggest regret.","When my mom and I moved to a rural area we weren’t sure what to expect. We lived in those copy and paste neighborhoods where every single house got built at the same time and looked completely alike. So saying it was a big change was an understatement. It is odd to say but I miss seeing people. I wouldn’t call myself a people watcher, but being able to understand that everyone I am looking at has their own life outside of my perception is always a topic that interests me. When you look at someone you make up your own tale of their entire being. In one minute, you could think you have someone completely figured out. All I see now is greenery, trees surround our home and that is the extent of it. I hear no people talking, no kids laughing. Only the tune of our windchimes and the occasional plane that would fly over us. And even then I would catch myself thinking of where those people are going.  I would ask my mom why she would want us to move this far out and all she would say is “Privacy, I want to be able to leave my home and not see a single house outside besides my own.”. As much as I understood her answer, I wished she would see it from my perspective. We moved over an hour away from my friends, my old school, and basically everything I have ever known. It sadly has made us resent each other. She wishes I would just move on and accept the change, I wish she would pack everything up and move us back. We spend a lot of days not talking to one another, a quick glance to acknowledge each other's presence then move on with our day. 

	Close to a month ago we had a conversation about the pole barn that was on our property. When we moved we got 15 acres of land along with a barn that was left. It was pretty nice to have, as we used it to store our cars and extra miscellaneous items that we didn’t have places for in our house. “So I don’t know if you saw but there was mouse shit on one of the window sills in the barn. I'm nervous that if it gets into our stuff it’ll ruin it all.” My mom said while making her coffee. “Well we do live in the middle of nowhere, so I am not sure what you expect.” I am half awake at this point trying to acclimate my eyes to the light, she's getting ready to head out to work and I'm getting ready for school. I sit at our dinner table that can seat 7 more but normally it is just me, on the rare occasion we sit there together but on different sides. My arm is on the table assisting me by keeping my head from drooping down and falling back asleep.  “I don’t need you to point out the obvious Lucy. I am saying this because I think we should get a barn cat. It will catch whatever is in there and stop it from fucking up our stuff.” She at this point was turned around facing me, her face constantly looking as if she was about to blow a fuse. She holds so much tension even in such mundane moments. I wish she would relax sometimes. We had a cat a long time ago, he was my moms when she was in college and he got to be a part of my life and watch me grow up. He was over 15 years old when he passed, it hit my mom a lot harder than I thought it could. Her suggesting getting another animal, seems like a big step in her grieving process. “I think that would be great! My only question is when and where are we going to get one?” I exclaimed, probably being too loud for it only being 6 in the morning. Her eye twitches, “One of the guys at work has a cat that gave birth a couple weeks ago, 5 healthy kittens; 2 boys and 3 girls. I wanted to ask you for your opinion before I left because I can pick one up after we get out.” So that was it. We looked at the picture her coworker sent of them all and I chose the one that I wanted her to get. He was an all black cat with a white patch on the front. I was holding my excitement and trying to not get too attached because I knew my mom wouldn’t let him in the house. He is only supposed to catch mice and live in our barn, that is it.  

	Fast forward until yesterday, I woke up early and ran to open up the barn door to let Vader out. I put on slides and wrapped a blanket around my shoulders. It isn’t a long walk, probably less than a minute to get up to the porch. The grass is covered in morning dew, I feel my skin absorbing the sun as if it didn’t see it just the day before. I will say, where we live now the way the morning feels is completely different. It is quiet and calming. The surrounding area looks more vibrant and lush. The trees expel what feels like the most nourishing air that you could ever breathe. I get up to the entrance of the barn, I locate the key that is hidden in a magnetic box. We attach the box under our grill so we don’t need to carry the key with us. It is always there and accessible for when we need it. He is so vocal that before I even finish unlocking the door he is chattering and making his presence known. The door is open and he runs out, only for him to turn around and beg me for his breakfast. We have made a routine, if we don’t follow it he will meow outside of the house until we get him back on schedule. I head back down to our house once he is all set, I see him get as low to the ground as he can and walk slowly towards a bird. The wind almost sounds like it stops in order to not blow his cover. He pounces at it only to completely whiff. Yet, he remains determined. He has caught 5 mice at this point. It is gross but on occasion we see little carcasses or body parts in our yard. I feel bad for them because it seems like they go out in the worst way possible. 

	“Alright I am going to work, are you good to be here most of today by yourself?” My mom questioned, she is actively walking away from me and I was lucky I heard most of the question. “What do you mean, it is Saturday? What do you need to go in for?”, “They offered overtime and we need the money, is that a good enough explanation for you ""mom? ""."" She said that with a scathing tone in her voice. She does these things that she knows gets under my skin.  “I don’t understand why you take everything I say so personally. I don’t do everything with malicious intent, so why does it feel like you do? All I did was simply ask you a question and you just spit back at me as a response, it is frustrating.” Tears swell in my eyes, I try to regulate my anger towards her, but it feels like her foot is stepping on my throat and all I can do is watch her continue to push down with all her might. “How about, I simply asked you a question last night, do you even remember what it was? How do you think the cat got put up, hm? You were asleep in your room and I had to get up in the middle of the night because I heard that fucking cat screeching outside our house. I asked you to put him up before it got dark, one simple fucking request yet I was the one who had to do it. You not listening yet acknowledging and saying you will do what I asked is frustrating and it's old. You are grown enough to handle this. Please for the love of god start acting like it.”. She said this all while walking around the house like a chicken with its head cut off. She was taking her hair rollers out, putting her socks on and packing her lunch box. How can she say these things while not even looking at me once. I didn’t have a good response though. I did say I would put him up, and completely forgot and went to bed. But as much as I tried not to, I couldn’t help but oppose her argument. “He is a cat mom, being outside one night won’t hurt him. You see how he gets the mice, he is more than able to defend himself. So is it really that big of a deal or are you just making it one so you can find something to yell at me for?”. She freezes. Her face was red and her lips scrunched into her face. The whites in her eyes have never been so prominent and her eyebrows arched so much that they could’ve been touching. The tension was so high, I could hear my own heart racing. I knew I shouldn’t have said what I did, but when she has such a vindictive tone while spewing cruel words in my face, it feels like in the moment, that that is the only thing I can do. She walks up to me, we are the same height so she just stares straight into my eyes. “I am going to work. Put. the cat. up. Tonight.”. I sit there tongue tied. Tears at this point are coming out consistently. We don’t blink, almost feeling like we are seeing who will look away first. While still looking at me she grabs her purse off the counter next to us, brushes against me and scuffs out the door. I stand there for a moment, taking in what just happened. This is all we were anymore. I miss who I thought she was. I miss being too young for confrontation. Here I was again, alone in our house. The house I never even fucking wanted. I lay down on our living room couch, our window is open and I see the cat chasing after leaves. I use my sleeve and wipe my face and chuckle at how hard he is trying. I turn on the tv and mindlessly scroll on my phone. I enjoy having the background noise, it helps me not feel just how bare our home is. I cry a bit reminiscing on the argument, I make all my own meals and lay back down. I was circling the same room trying to see if after this lap something would be different. Kitchen, living room, bedroom back to living room. Once I finally found a show I enjoyed, against my moms wishes I ended up falling asleep on our sofa.

	I wake up hours later, sweat dripping down my neck and my eyes feeling like they are glued shut. How long did I nap for? As I sat up rubbing my eyes, I caught a glimpse of my mom running in her room and slamming the door. It felt like she was gone at the speed of light. I heard her feet behind me and she was gone the next. I stood up and stretched all my limbs, I was about to knock on her door when it finally hit me. “The fucking cat.” I whispered to myself. Shit, shit, shit. I didn't even grab a jacket, I slid my shoes on and ran outside. It was dark out, it's odd. She never works until it is dark but the way she ran into her room it feels like she just got home. “Vader! Where are you buddy?”. I yell out into the dark woods. It feels like a kids drawing where they only draw the things right in front, excluding everything else that doesn’t matter to them. They will draw only their house, neglecting the fact that they have neighbors that live right alongside them.  We have one motion light on the barn porch but besides that it feels like everything surrounding me was colored with jet black paint. No details or forms, just obscured. “Kitty? You gotta go back inside, it is bedtime!” I stand on the porch puzzled. He is always either sitting on our house deck, or right outside the barn waiting to get put up. Motion light turns off. I swing my arms in order to turn it back on so I can find the grill and get the key to unlock the door. What the heck? I bend over to look under the table stand part of the grill where the box normally is set. It was gone. I turned in circles trying to see where it could be. Who would move it? I stepped slowly to the door, turned the handle and it opened with ease. Maybe my mom already put him up and accidentally brought the keys inside. “Vader, you in here?” I walk around our barn. Moms car, my car and moving boxes stacked on top of one another with no rhyme or reason. It feels almost like a loft, studio apartment. Cement floor, high ceilings, but nothing inside is finished, only wooden beams and exposed steel decorate this building. I try to locate Vader, but he is nowhere to be found. I walk to the front of my car only to find the most disgusting pile of meat. Animal meat. I see little organs, intestines and so much blood. My arms feel numb and my legs feel like at any moment they can just collapse. Maybe a raccoon got in and Vader killed it! Yeah that had to be it. He is probably hurt somewhere from the fight. I mustered up any strength I could find left in my legs and ran back out. “VADER PLEASE COME BACK, WHERE ARE YOU!” I sound so silly calling after an animal that I know can’t respond back. I look into the dark woods, it is hopeless that I could find anything there. I turn my phone flashlight on to give me more clearance. I see two glowing orbs in the treeline to the right of my house. Motion light turns off. “Vader there you are, you scared me!” I felt so much relief flush through my veins. I started walking in the grass towards the void, but something made me stop dead in my tracks. The glowing eyes started to get taller. Slowly I saw them rise up, too high to be vader, to be any animal at this point. It started stepping out towards me and all I could think of doing was getting more light so I can see what this thing was. I slowly walked backwards towards the barn porch, activating the light once again. This time I saw the horror that has been hiding in the woods this whole time, and sadly the optimistic idea I had of what I found in the barn was at this point proven wrong. It was a man. He looked to be 6 foot tall, naked and hunched over so far that I couldn’t even see his stomach. He stood there with a blank expression, arms not at his sides but folded in front of him, almost looking like he touched something gross. He was completely covered in blood, and the glowing eyes I saw were not his own, but the eyes of my skinned cat he wore upon his head. Almost as if he was showing off his accomplishment. Vader's poor head sat on top of his, and he tied his arms together under his chin with what looked like twine. I can’t move, I can’t even breathe. This is all my fault. I fucking fell asleep and this is what happened because I didn’t put him up. My face feels hot, I don’t even know what time it is and I don’t know what to make of the situation ahead of me. 

Motion light off.

	It is silent, almost sounds like the wind came to a halt and all that is left is me and this man doing a staring contest. In the pitch black, my phone is still locked onto his location then all I hear is this ear pitching screech. He starts making the noise a cat makes when it is mad. It starts out low but only gets louder the more angrier he gets. It is deep and guttural. It transitions into a human scream and he pounces towards me. I hear twigs and branches break as he lunges his big body towards me, trying to close the gap between us. I sprint into my house, not looking back once. He is still screaming as he chases me, and what scared me the most was it didn’t sound like he was out of breath once. It had the same tempo, not breathy and not faulting as he ran. Just fueled with straight anger. I got in the house and locked the door just in time. He starts throwing his body at the house. Full force flinging his entire being at the screen door. Why is he not trying to use his hands to open it? I didn’t have time to think of the technicalities, so I ran straight to my mom. “Mom please wake up, please help! Vader is dead! There is a-” I opened her bedroom door. She is on all fours on her bed, like the man she is naked as well. Her back arches in the most feline way, her spine pushing against her skin. It looks like if she were to go any further in an arch her spine would tear away at her flesh. I hear the cracks of all her bones. I see each bump of her vertebrae peeking through.  She quickly whips her head in my direction and hisses so loud a fall back, the edge of our sofa breaking my fall. “MOM PLEASE!” I howled. Me addressing her only seemed to piss her off more. She jumps off her bed and begins to run towards me. I get up and run to my room. Our one floor house has never felt so big and obscure. I got to my room and quickly locked it before she was able to reach me. Her nails start scratching at my door. I see almost instantly her nails begin to bleed, carpet and paint from the door digging into her nail beds. She stretches her hand as far as she could under the door frame and continues to do so until her fingers go raw, and even once they hit that point she doesn’t stop. “Mom please stop! I can’t do this please, I need you!” I sob into my hands because at this point I can’t handle the site of her hands slowly turning into what looks like raw ground beef. I begin to see the bones in her finger tips, and she gets angrier and angrier everytime I say “mom”. In the midst of trying to find out what to do I hear a thud at my window. The man now has Vader in his hand. He is pounding the flaccid skin of my cat against my window, so much so that he begins to deteriorate on the window pane. I hyperventilate not being able to understand why this is happening. “Stop, STOP THAT, HE IS ALREADY DEAD PLEASE JUST STOP!”. It almost feels like he is rubbing in the fact that I was a neglectful owner. He is showing me that this is your pet, the safety that was up to you to withhold is now in my hands. You didn’t put him back in the barn, so he is mine now. And you have no one to blame but yourself. 

	I close the curtains and open my closet door and sit down. I undo a wire hanger and fold it a couple times in order to make some sort of defense tool. I have nothing in my room better, I didn’t think I would need to defend myself especially not in these fucked up circumstances. I can’t watch my mom hurt herself more so I say her name quietly to myself in the closet where she can’t hear me. “Mom, I am so sorry. I love you. I didn't mean for all this to happen. Please just stop. Please.” My head is faced down, my knees held up to my chest. I am the only person I have now that can tell me it’ll be okay, that as long as you keep trying that is all that matters. I don’t want to keep trying, I don’t want to possibly come to the scenario of having to defend myself against the woman who gave birth to me. And that man.. Thing. I don’t even know what to do with that. I can’t beat him, I can’t win no matter the circumstance. I stay faced towards the door so if by chance it opens, I can charge with everything I got. I wait, and I wait. The scraping noises slowly die down and the banging at the window comes to a halt. I tried staying up, I couldn’t possibly sleep with them outside of my room. They are able to come in, bang the door down, use a hairpin to shove into the doorhandle to unlock my door. But for some reason, they are not doing those things. Almost as if they don’t know how or are unable to do so. What felt like hours passed I ended up falling asleep even though I did my best not to do so. I woke up and it was quiet. I opened the door and tiptoed out. I slowly go to my window, moving the curtain ever so slightly so no one could tell it was even opened. There it is again. The morning dew, the encapsulating sun. The bird that Vader chased yesterday sits perched on a branch. I see residue left on the window, I gag and try to keep the contents of my stomach down where it belongs. I turn towards the exit. Is she still out there? I walked towards the door, feeling like I was under so much pressure to remain silent. I knew which floor boards creaked in my room, I had to memorize it so I could sneak out. Once again, going against my moms wishes. My hand upon the door handle I twisted it slightly only to come to an immediate halt. I didn’t see any light come from under the door frame. What felt like a crude dream proved to be real when I looked under the door and all I saw was skin. I put my ear to the door and heard light snoring from my mom. So light that it could be mistaken for purring. I lay down, press my back against the door. In a weird way this was calming. I was with my mom again and she was just sleeping. Almost like when I used to sneak into her room when I had nightmares. She knew I was there, I was never sneaky no matter how much I tried. She would hold me and brush my hair from my eyes. She would tuck me into bed with her and hearing her breathing helped me know that I was safe. And hearing it now is no different. 

I know my fate, I think at some point last night I accepted what is to come. All I can do is lay down with my mom one last time. Knowing that as soon as I open up this door everything I know will come to an end. I just wished I listened, I wish I wasn’t so eager to prove her wrong. Vader didn’t deserve this, and neither did she. I drop my makeshift dagger, and close my eyes. “Goodnight, mom.”. I moved my mouth to those words, no sound coming out. I go back to sleep knowing that this will be the last time I spend with her, numb yet tranquil. ",1,1769235424.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I was seeing this person with whom I vibed on a many levels. We both are foodies, loved music & cinema. Almost like my clone in terms of enjoying life. 

We used talk hours on end about which places to eat out next at, which place has best coffee ani. Tharuvatha about movies too, infact our first date was a movie date, we liked films of similar genre also (romantic & comedy). In one of our conversations she mentioned about this old movie 'Princess Diaries' ani, how that's her all time favorite movie and it's her go to movie if she feels down. Sarle, manaku Adhurs elano thanaku adi ala ani vadilesa.

A month down the line, I planned a weekend breakfast date. Oka kotha dosa place try chesam, it was just 😋🤌 assala. After that, we just went to a park and strolled around because she was tired completely that week and we just wanted to relax. Finally at noon before dropping her home for lunch, I asked if we can stop at a laptop service center as mine had some issues and she agreed.

We stopped this place which is like a commercial building with supermarket in ground floor, small offices and cloud kitchens on top floors. She was waiting down, I went up with my laptop and called her up. She came to the floor I was in but became cautious as it was very dark there. I asked her, ""Do you trust me?"". She hesitated, gulped down some air and said ""Yes"". I closed her eyes and took her to this dark room and closed the door.

I made her sit on the sofa and opened her eyes to the title card of the movie 'Princess Diaries'. This room was in a private home theater I reserved to watch this movie together as that week she was super stressed out at work. She couldn't control her excitement to watch it. She was pausing the film in between and telling me the back story of the characters, whenever her favorite scenes were about to come she squealed and pressed my hand and was vibing to the soundtrack in her seat only. Seeing her so happy felt so precious at that moment that I feared I would give her dishti/nazar. When the movie ended I could see how evidently relaxed she seemed 🥰, it was a sight to behold assalu.

Since we had another half hour in that theater, we started playing some of our fav songs (Kadallalle & Birds of feather actually) and just slow danced hugging each other. \*\*If I experienced 'Bliss' ever in my life, it was in that moment.\*\*

  
So mothaniki, I had to lie to have a good time with my date. Idi cheating antaro ento mari.

  
TLDR: OP had to lie to make his date watch her fav movie as a surprise, because she was feeling down.

### **I Built This With $50 of Scrap Wood — What Would You Change?**

I’m the kind of person who hates throwing good wood away.  
A few months ago, I had a pile of offcuts collecting dust in the corner of my garage — different widths, different species, and (for some reason) one piece that had about twelve random screw holes in it. Instead of tossing them, I challenged myself: *What can I actually build from this mess with nothing but patience and about fifty bucks’ worth of spare materials?*

It became a personal experiment in learning, not just building.

The first weekend was… humbling.  
Cuts wouldn’t line up. I split two boards because I rushed the pilot holes, and half my frustration came from realizing the problem wasn’t “bad wood,” it was bad habits. When I slowed down, re-measured, and respected the grain, everything suddenly started clicking.  

And now—after too many cups of coffee—it’s done.  
Simple lines, solid joinery, a few visible imperfections (that I’m actually proud of)… but it’s standing strong and holding weight. I felt like I finally *earned* this little project.

Here’s the part I want your input on:  
👉 If this were *your* build, what details would you change or improve?  
Texture, finish, structure, joinery—let’s critique this like we’re all in the same workshop together.

And if you’ve ever battled those “why can’t I get this right?” moments, there’s something that seriously helped me reset the basics.  
I found an approach that focuses less on fancy tools and more on what actually makes wood behave — planning, cuts, and patience. You can check it out here:

I like listening to music from rock, house, ambient, lofi, some rap and liminal. 

Usually I can be found sleeping or on my motorcycle riding around. Usually to a downtown city and grab a cup of coffee, walk around and browse the local shops. I was just in Pomona to check out a concert which was fun. But I live in Yucaipa area. I like checking out thrift shops, record stores, going to small concerts, and hiking sometimes. 

Also into photography so I'll usually carry my camera sometimes in my bag haha. Oh I like treats and snacks too. 

I don't really play video games anymore, but do watch YouTube videos and try to catch up on TV shows.

Not his real name, but I say, “find Jake,” and my dog is off to the races.  
I hide with my dog in the bedroom and count to ten, then it’s go time. He guides me with fervor out of the room, and into the kitchen where he does a full, searching, 360 degree turn, and I’m just pirouetting beside him. Then it’s off to the living room. I can feel  through the harness handle and his leash that his head is moving back and forth with his search. 

  
I know the instant that he locks eyes on my husband, because he pants with sheer joy and bounds through the room so fast that I’m practically waving like a flag flowing in the breeze behind him. 

When he gets to Jake, we cheer, and the dog wags his tail so hard that I nearly have a callous on my leg from where his tail hits me over and over. 

  
My husband and I are full-on adults, but we love this game nearly as much as the dog does. My husband even finds little nooks and crannies to hide  in to make it an extra challenge. Once, he hid under a low coffee table, all 6 feet of him.

  
The practical use for this task is that when we shop together and get separated, I can have the dog help me find Jake, but it doesn’t hurt to keep the skil fresh by practicing at home every now and then.",1,1769234827.0,Blind,0,1.0,False

the whole day i could not stop thinking about chocolate sprite. mixed about 2 teaspoons of chocolate milk powder to some sprite. got really scared at first because it began to foam up, but honestly? not as bad as i feared it would be. i probably put in too much chocolate but it paired well with the lemon lime. i would not make this again but i'm glad i did.",9,1769234580.0,somnigastronomy,1,1.0,False

1qleysl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLCChibiAbuse/comments/1qleysl/strawberry_jam/,Strawberry jam,"The strawberry jam dripped thick and slow from the counter's edge, pooling in a sticky puddle on the linoleum. Sayori stared at it, her tiny hands pressed against the chilled surface of the refrigerator door, toes curling against the cold metal hinge.



""Oopsie!"" she chirped, though her voice wobbled just slightly. The jam jar had been nearly empty—just a few scrapes left—but the sudden tilt when she'd tugged it free sent the last of it splattering down. Her owner would be annoyed. Maybe worse. Her chest tightened, but she forced a giggle anyway. ""Silly Sayori, always making messes!""



Footsteps creaked in the hallway, deliberate and slow. Her breath hitched. She scrambled to wipe at the jam with the hem of her dress, but the fabric just smeared it further, staining the bright pink cotton a deeper, uneven red.



""Sayori."" The voice was warm, affectionate even, but the way his shadow swallowed the light as he leaned over her made her pulse stutter. His fingers brushed the top of her head—gentle, always so gentle at first—before tracing down to her shoulder. ""What did you do?""



""Ahaha, just—just a little spill!"" She twisted to face him, grin stretched too wide, arms flapping like a broken puppet's. ""I'll clean it! Promise!"" The words tumbled out too fast, sticky as the jam seeping between her toes. His thumb stroked her cheek, slow, contemplative. His nails were freshly trimmed. Neat. Precise.



He crouched, bringing his face level with hers, exhaling coffee-scented warmth over her trembling frame. ""You know how I feel about messes."" His free hand closed around her wrist—not squeezing, not yet—just testing the give of her joints. Her pulse thrummed against his fingertips, a frantic little drumbeat. ""You're shaking,"" he murmured, almost amused. ""Why?""



The refrigerator hummed. A drop of jam plopped onto the floor. Sayori's giggle dissolved into a wet hiccup. ""S-silly me, right? Always—"" His grip tightened. The creak of her bones shifting echoed louder than her gasp. Her vision blurred at the edges as his other hand slid down to her thigh, fingers splaying wide enough to span the entire width of her leg.



""Let's see how far you stretch,"" he cooed. The first pull came slow—luxuriously slow—her shoulder popping loose with a sound like a cork leaving a wine bottle. Blood welled instantly, shockingly bright against her pastel skin. She didn't scream. Couldn't. Her breath came in shallow whistles as he admired the glistening tendons, the way they strained, snapped, finally gave way with a wet tear.



""No,"" she squeaked, legs kicking air, ""no no you \*love\* me—\*stop—\*"" Her remaining hand clawed at his thumb, nails leaving pink crescents. He laughed, low and velvet, as if she'd told a joke. His fingers found the join of her thigh, pressing in until cartilage groaned. ""Shhh,"" he murmured, ""you're \*perfect\* like this."" The second rip sent her spine arching, a high-pitched keen escaping her lips before she collapsed forward, head lolling. Blood pattered onto the jam-smeared floor, indistinguishable now.



He held her up by one ankle, watching her sway like a broken doll. Her remaining eye rolled toward him, pupil blown wide with terror. ""P-please—"" she slurred, saliva pink. His grip shifted, thumb pressing into the delicate hollow behind her knee. The \*crack\* of her femur splitting was louder than he expected. She didn't make a sound this time. Just trembled, a leaf in a hurricane, as he peeled her apart with the same care one might devour a ripe peach.



When it was done—when she was just a tangle of meat and matted hair—he rinsed her in the sink, watching the water spiral red down the drain. Her head went last, bobbing once before vanishing with a gurgle. He hummed, wiping his hands on a dish towel already stiff with dried jam. The fridge door still hung open, casting a long, cold rectangle of light across the floor where a single strawberry-scented drop trembled on the edge of the counter. He licked it off his finger, smiling. ""Silly Sayori.""",1,1769234139.0,DDLCChibiAbuse,0,1.0,False

I asked him if he wanted to grab a meal last week and he said he’d try to figure something out in his schedule.

Recently, hes been posting a lot of videos hanging out with this other guy. The way they interact and how much theyve been hanging out makes me think they are in the early stages of a relationship. His status also says in a relationship. It just sucks, I feel like I was working up to asking him out and then this happens. Im not 100% sure that im right and hope im wrong, but I just have a guy feeling this suspicion is right. 

I also think someone else likes me that I dont have feelings for in return. I dont know him that well (dont even actually know his name just seen him at events, he goes by a nickname). Our conversations are never really anything other than him wanting hugs and I dont really know much about what he does.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qleov6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PassNclexTips/comments/1qleov6/reposthow_to_pass_the_nclex_i_failed_in_150_then/,"Repost:HOW TO PASS THE NCLEX (I failed in 150, then passed in 85)","I just found out I passed my second attempt in 85 questions after failing in 150! \*\*All of my praise goes to God!!!\*\* TRULY!!! 

I wanted to share my two cents on \*\*HOW TO PASS THE NCLEX:\*\*

\*\*\*✨MY FIRST ATTEMPT\*\*\* \*(failed in 150)\*

\* \*\*What I studied:\*\*

   \* Listened to Mark K lectures 1-12

   \* Arch3r (I took one CAT exam and passed, and I took 7 readiness exams and got VH, VH, BL, VH VH, H, H in that order. No practice questions)

   \* Listened to Dr Sharon must know meds 1-10 videos

\* \*\*How the exam went:\*\*

   \* Walked in feeling confident

   \* Finished in 150 questions, it felt way harder than any nursing exam I’ve ever taken

   \* I think I had 7 case studies, one bow tie, one picture to identify, etc

   \* I left knowing I failed... it was awful

\*\*\*✨MY SECOND ATTEMPT\*\*\* (passed in 85)

\* \*\*What I studied:\*\*

   \* NCLEX Crusade on YouTube (red and blue background videos)

   \* NCLEX Bootcamp 30 days

   \* Dr Sharon on YouTube

   \* Listened to Mark K lecture 12 on the way to my exam

\* \*\*How the exam went:\*\*

   \* Walked in feeling confident (paranoid but confident)

   \* Finished in 85 questions, it was WAY easier than my first attempt

   \* I had 5 case studies (they all felt quite easy expect for the 5th one was kinda hard), lots of multiple choice

   \* I left feeling certain that I passed!!! I literally cried tears of joy when I got in my car

\*\*\*✨WHAT I RECOMMEND STUDYING:\*\*\*

\* \*\*NCLEX Crusade 7 day training on YouTube\*\*

   \* Red background videos

   \* Blue background (NGN) videos

   \* I thought the info in these vids were pretty obvious but it was a nice way of re-introducing studying when I was still grumpy about retaking lol. It introduces test strategy well

\* \*\*NCLEX Bootcamp!!!\*\*

   \* I followed the 30 day study plan. I truly love bootcamp, and it made the studying process somewhat enjoyable (or at least, way more bearable)

   \* I wanted to make SURE I gave it my all to pass my second attempt, and I think Bootcamp definitely strengthened my knowledge & prepared me to accomplish that

   \* \*\*\*My Bootcamp stats:\*\*\*

\* I finished all case studies + watched the review videos (so helpful!)

\* I did 1830 questions of the Q bank (read all rationales and took notes on only some)

\* Did all of the fundamentals questions & repeated the ones I got wrong until I got them right (NCLEX loves fundamentals!!)

\* Overall performance was 72%

\* I got very high on every readiness exam (73%, 79%, 71%, 74%)

\* \*(The most important thing is to do a ton of practice questions and READ THE RATIONALES and understand WHY you got it wrong)\*

\* \*\*Dr Sharon on YouTube\*\*

   \* “Prioritization strategies” playlist (watch all of the videos)

   \* “Fundamentals” playlist (for any topics you struggle with)

   \* She’s great for understanding test strategy! I would pause her videos to do the practice question by myself and then unpause to see how she explained her thought process

\* \*\*NCSBN has an NCLEX exam preview\*\*

   \* I didn’t do this, but if you wanted extra study practice, there’s an NCLEX preview exam on the NCSBN website

   \* There’s a quizlet with the correct answers to check your work

\*\*\*✨My MISTAKES the first time:\*\*\*

\* \*\*I only took practice tests.\*\* I remediated those exams but didn’t look at the categories I was doing good/bad in. It wasn’t a comprehensive approach

\* \*\*I didn’t take breaks during my study sessions.\*\* I literally only took practice exams with no breaks. It burnt me out. For my second attempt, some days I'd do 20 questions at a time then a break and then more questions, and some days I'd lock in for a practice exam. It wasn't nonstop grind every day

\* \*\*I didn’t do any practice Qs\*\*. It’s so helpful to get immediate feedback on questions right after you answered it so that you can immediately correct yourself & evaluate your thought process. Then test yourself with practice exams to simulate the exam

\* \*\*I didn’t reaaally think I needed to study!\*\* I had a 3.96 GPA, did very well on the exit exam, my college has a 96% pass rate, Arch3r said I had >98% chance of passing. But I didn’t do a comprehensive study approach and didn’t realize I was lacking in a few knowledge areas— then the NCLEX noticed I was getting those topics wrong and kept testing me on them 

   \* (for example, I didn’t realize I struggled with infection control. But I still scored well on the practice tests before my first attempt because I performed well enough on the rest of the test and didn’t review the categories of where I needed to study more. Then on my first attempt of the NCLEX, it kept giving me infection control Qs because I was getting them wrong and then it led me to being on the cusp of passing. All I needed was a little refresher on infection control rules, but I didn’t realize that until after I failed and looked into it)

\* \*\*I didn’t know that the NCLEX was more of a critical thinking exam\*\* and not simply a content exam. Idk maybe I was living under a rock but no one told me this?? I was freaked out on my first attempt when I got diseases, meds, etc that I had NEVER heard of, and then I just thought “well I never learned about this, so I guess I have to guess??” I didn't know the strategy. I wish I knew that critical thinking is the WHOLE POINT of the NCLEX! If you don’t know something, use critical thinking skills + use the strategies from Bootcamp rationales & Dr Sharon videos

\* Also, just a side note, \*\*consider not telling anyone when you’re taking the test.\*\* It takes the pressure off. And it killed me having to tell all of my friends, family, etc that I failed (especially because they all expected me to pass without a doubt, so I felt like even more like a let down lol. Very humbling!)

\*\*\*✨CRITICAL THINKING ADVICE:\*\*\*

\* \*\*Look for key words\*\*— what is the question REALLY asking? The answer should address it

\* If a question asks what is the FIRST thing you would do or what would you PRIORITIZE… I will think “okay, that means all of the answer choices could be true.” Instead of trying to figure out what’s right or wrong, assume they all are correct. Then say, “if I could only do ONE thing, what would I do first / which is the MOST important?” (Also, there is usually a difference between the FIRST and BEST action)

\* \*\*Look for absolute words\*\* (always, never, only, etc)… that could mean that answer choice is incorrect

\* \*\*When in distress, do not assess!\*\* If the patient is in severe life or death distress, you probably aren’t going to evaluate something— you are likely first going to take an action to help them

\* \*\*If you don’t know, use process of elimination!\*\* If the question has a random disease or disorder you don’t recognize, look at the answer choices and try to see if you know any of those and then eliminate them if it’s something else!

\* When evaluating answer choices… \*\*if you could only do ONE thing, which one would you do?\*\* NCLEX tends to like the most SAFE and LEAST INVASIVE possibility that will fix the problem

\* \*\*Don't choose the answer choice you don't know over the one that you do know!\*\* Dr Sharon says this all the time. If you're going through the answer choices and you see one that you think is right, and then you see an answer choice that you've never heard of and don't know if it's right or wrong... DON'T CHOOSE THE ONE YOU'RE UNSURE OF!

\* \*\*Compare two answer choices at a time!!!\*\* This was one of the most helpful strategies for me!! Especially for questions that ask for the “best” nursing action. Think to yourself \*\*\*“If I do A but not B… would that be better than if I did B but not A?”\*\*\*

\* \*\*Prioritization strategies to remember:\*\*

   \* Unexpected vs Expected

   \* Early vs Late

   \* Acute vs Chronic

   \* Objective vs Subjective

   \* Physiological vs Psychosocial

\*\*\*✨Studying advice:\*\*\*

\* While studying, \*\*take it seriously like you would on test day!\*\* If you get a question you don’t know, you might want to just guess because it’s just a practice Q… but would you just guess on the exam? Probably not! You would likely take it more seriously because it’s the exam! Pretend like your studying is the exam. If you don’t know a question, rack your brain or try to use critical thinking to narrow it down. It might work or it might not. But you practice your critical thinking! And if you get it wrong, you can evaluate your thinking / learn the content and then apply it next time you come across an unknown question

\* \*\*Limit distractions.\*\* Put your phone AWAY! Practice answering questions with focus. I would put my phone in a drawer, and it actually helped so much with focusing.

\* \*\*Act like your practice test is the exam.\*\* Simulate it! Take it at the time your exam is scheduled for. Don’t go on your phone between questions. Don’t sip on coffee or water during your practice test (you can’t bring food or drink into the actual test room). Only get up for a bathroom break or a water/snack break if you need it. 

\* If there’s a day you’re feeling particularly anxious (especially as your exam date approaches), try to \*\*study while trying to manage your anxiety\*\* (think of it as practice for test day!)

\* \*\*Study areas that you know you’re weak in!\*\* Bootcamp gives you percentages in each category which can help identify your weak spots. And you should watch Dr Sharon vids in those categories too!

\* \*\*STUDY FUNDAMENTALS!!!!!!!!!!\*\*

\* \*\*STUDY PRIORITIZATION & DELEGATION!!!!!!!!!!\*\*

\*\*\*✨When going to take the exam…\*\*\*

\* \*\*Mentally prepare\*\*

   \* Tell yourself, “I know I’m going to feel anxious. I know I might see things I’ve never heard of” etc …don’t freak out about! Just make sure to breatheee and go slow and \*\*think clearly\*\*

\* \*\*Reread the question!!\*\* So many times if I got a practice Q wrong, I’d read the question over and realize I misread the question!

\* If you don’t know the answer right away, SIT AND THINK! \*\*Don’t just guess and move on immediately.\*\* At the very least, try to narrow it down or rack your brain

\* \*\*Expect 150 questions.\*\* I don’t care how smart you are. I went into my first attempt feeling so confident and assumed I would get 85 questions since so many of my peers did and I had good scores blah blah blah. HUMBLED!!! When I got to 86, I didn’t panic— but it certainly didn’t boost my confidence. Just get over your pride and expect 150 Qs and be pleasantly surprised if you pass in anything less

\* \*\*Don’t select SATA questions based on vibes\*\* lol. I would always make that mistake and over-click answers because “I feel like it sounds right.” I’d rather under-click correct choices and get partial credit than over-click and accidentally click something wrong. There were a couple times I only selected one answer choice on SATA of my passing exam

\* \*\*Use the whiteboard!\*\* I didn’t use it on my first attempt but it really helped me straighten out my thoughts on my second attempt!!

\* \*\*Pray!!!!! Pray, pray, pray!\*\*

\*\*\*✨The last thing I will say:\*\*\*

\* \*\*My first attempt felt SO MUCH HARDER than my second attempt.\*\* 

\* Maybe if I knew the test strategies I would’ve felt differently, but the content itself truly threw me for a loop too. I genuinely didn’t know how to target my studying for my second attempt at first because the exam felt like NOTHING I had studied for previously. And then my first Bootcamp exam when prepping for my retake said that I had no categories to improve in, so I was like what am I supposed to improve in to pass??

\* I think learning the test strategies was really helpful (expected vs unexpected, etc), but also I do think the content on my second attempt was SIGNIFICANTLY easier. I GENUINELY think it was just an easier exam. Knowing the test strategies made it even easier. But I feel like if I had my second attempt exam for my first attempt, I would’ve passed. But who knows! And who cares!

\* Regardless, I’m glad I studied hard for the second attempt because you just never know what kind of test you will get! And it allowed me to walk in confidently despite the nerves from the possibility of failing again. So, \*\*LEARN THE TEST STRATEGIES!!\*\* And \*\*use NCLEX Bootcamp\*\*!!! If I could go back, I would have rather overstudied the first go around than have to tell everyone I know that I failed, pay another $550 to retake, and spend hours and hours studying for a month and a half leading up to my second attempt (it sucked... but I'm so grateful to be done).

I pray this was helpful!! And if you’re retaking, \*\*you CAN and WILL pass!!!\*\* I know it feels never-ending, but \*\*PERSEVERE!!\*\* The Lord is your strength!

That being said, I've eaten about a dozen of these amazing little guys since coming to the islands... and they're not the only local variety. My wife and I stopped at a locally owned coffee and fruit stand on Maui and ordered a sampler fruit platter that had 3 different varieties of locally grown bananas, none of which were the ""Cavendish"" variety found on the mainland.

All I can say is none of the bananas I've tasted on these islands are even remotely close to the industrial Cavendish banana sold across the country and the world. These little gems are creamy, sweet and tangy, almost like a cross between an apple and a strawberry.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

She pretended to drink it as she walked, her umbrella on the other hand, shielding her from the rain. Not that she cared about the rain, but her carefully maintained cover needed these small gestures.

She was on her way towards one of the bars, where one of her herd was waiting for her. The coffee was for her. Eirini liked the small electrifying sensation of drinking caffeine-loaded blood. It made her feel… alive.

It was a good feeling. It reminded her of the feeling she got after a big performance, when she was just Eirini, singing in Constantinople, before the Basileus and the nobility discovered her talents.

Now, her voice was of another world, much like herself. She could manipulate both kine and kindred alike with her songs. She could make them dance until their bones broke and their body gave out. She could project emotions into them, from intense infatuation to a deep hatred. Her voice, which previously was nothing more than a precious musical instrument, had turned into so much more, thanks to her mastery of Melpominee.



“Hey, beautiful”, growled a raspy, unappealing voice from the shadows, “Where are you going in such a hurry?”



Her eyes quickly analysed the origin of the voice. A burly mortal man, with long hair and beard, was smiling wickedly at her, showing a smile of few teeth. He was wearing a raincoat, and he smelled of alcohol.

She ignored him, casually walking towards the bar, but the loud banging of his boots against the cobbled sidewalk told her he wasn’t taking no for an answer.

He grabbed her wrist and pulled her towards himself.

She opened her mouth to speak and locked eyes with him.



“Not here, darling”, her voice flowing like the wind on a flowered field, carrying petals and dandelion seeds across the vast distance, “too many people will see.”



“Oh, I didn’t know you wanted it like that”, said the man with lust-filled eyes.



Her voice whispered, but her will boomed across his being. His will was shattered in an instant.



“Take me to somewhere private, my love”, said Irene.



He gleefully walked ahead of her, leading her into a tunnel, hidden in an alleyway.

She looked around, and in the darkness, she noticed another man, laying in the ground, a bunch of needles on the floor next to him.



“Jorge? Who is this? Did you bring a new morsel for us to share, *mano*?”



Before Jorge could speak Irene giggled.



“This tunnel has some interesting acoustics. I bet my singing here would sound amazing.”



The other man slowly got up, rubbing his hands and licking his lips.



“Indeed. Although I think your moaning and screaming will sound  a lot hotter than your singing bouncing off the walls”



Irene stopped laughing and tilted her head.



“Moaning? I think you’re confused. Because you see…”



She dove into her power and unleashed her true voice, the sound reflecting off the walls, almost creating a chorus of power.



***“He wants me all to himself. You hate him for that.”***



Jorge roared and lunged at the man as the man, with rage-filled eyes, grabbed a pocked knife and stabbed Jorge in the abdomen.

The two fell to the ground, tussling and grabbing each other. Jorge grabbed the needles on the ground and stabbed his friend on the neck several times, as his friend kept stabbing him in the stomach, their blood mixing in a pool on the grimy ground.



Irene could smell their blood, the mix of alcohol and heroin. She frowned and turned her head, hoping to catch the scent of the rain outside. She hated blood like this. She could drink it, sure. After all, she wasn’t like those fools in Lisbon. But she still didn’t like it.



A scream echoed through the tunnel as Jorge poked the man’s eyes out and finally, in one decisive move, grabbed a stone and bashed it against the man’s forehead, breaking his skull with a muffled crunch.



Irene closed her eyes and let her voice fly free once again, weaving Jorge’s psyche to her will.



***“You must be feeling terrible. You are full of anguish and sorrow. You just killed your friend. Someone you considered a brother. The despair… you must be feeling.”***



Jorge, still putting pressure on to the multiple stab wounds on his belly, moaned in grief, as he looked at the corpse beneath him.



“Oh Mário”, he was now crying, “what have I done to you Mário…”



Irene turned away and slowly stepped out of the tunnel, looking around to make sure no one was watching her. In one final act of power, she whispered, throwing her voice into the tunnel.



***“You see his knife… I think you know what you have to do.”***



She didn’t look to see if he did it. She didn’t need to. She had places to be after all.

This will be the last time I’m taking any readings- clearly it’s a fail again. Feels like a total time waster. So yea kinda in a dilemma now.

Was pretty upset I only just got to know my hospital’s IVF success rate is only a 38%, as compared to one of the ‘top private IVF clinic that is as high as 60.5-87%. What? Why can’t they just up their game and do the same? A renowned hospital with such miserable success rate is appalling.

Sorry I didn’t mean to be mean but I’m just upset and felt like I wasted all my time energy sacrifices and embryos.

And I’m stuck now because we alr spent so much and if we were to quit it with this hospital and move to another we got to spend a bomb again? The transport fee is insane btw. It’s literally the cost of a FET.? 😐

1qleg0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qleg0d/my_wife_found_a_dead_pixel_in_the_kitchen/,"My Wife Found a ""Dead Pixel"" in the Kitchen","""Mark, look at this,"" I heard Sarah yell, her voice tight. She was pointing at the backsplash behind the stove.

It was a perfect, light-less square, exactly one millimeter wide. It didn't look like a hole, it looked like a piece of the universe had simply failed to load. I tried to scrub it with a sponge, but the yellow foam didn't touch it. The sponge passed *through* the blackness, reappearing on the other side as if the space in between didn't exist.

""It’s just a defect in the tile,"" I lied. But that night, I watched the dot grow. By 3:00 AM, it was the size of a dime. I leaned in close, and instead of the wall, I smelled something that made my stomach turn: the sharp, metallic tang of a butcher shop mixed with the ozone of a short-circuiting server.

By the end of the week, the ""dead pixels"" were everywhere. They speckled the dog’s fur like static. They floated in the steam of my coffee. But when I tried to show our neighbor, he just stared at me with glazed, milky eyes. He didn't see the holes because, as I would soon learn, his ""Driver"" hadn't been updated to perceive the decay.

The suspense reached a breaking point on Tuesday. I was at my midtown firm, staring at a spreadsheet, when my boss, Mr. Henderson, walked in.

""Thorne, I need those projections,"" he said.

But his mouth didn't move in sync with the words. There was a sickening half-second delay, like a poorly dubbed movie. Then, his face *tore*. A jagged line of black pixels zipped from his forehead to his chin. For a heartbeat, I didn't see bone or blood. I saw a flickering, high-definition display of a dark, cold ocean.

Then, *snap*, he was back to normal. He adjusted his tie, oblivious to the fact that his left ear was now hovering two inches away from his head, disconnected by a void of white static.

I fled the office. I didn't take the elevator; I took the stairs. On the fourth landing, I tripped and slammed into the wall. The drywall didn't crack. It *moaned*. It felt soft, like the flank of a giant, sleeping animal. I peeled back a corner of the ""paint"" and found a layer of damp, pulsing velvet—the same texture I’d found in my apartment.

I burst into my home, screaming for Sarah. I found her in the kitchen, staring at the backsplash. The dead pixel was now a hole the size of a manhole cover.

""Sarah, we have to go!"" I grabbed her arm. Her skin felt like cold silicone.

""Go where, Mark?"" she asked. She turned around, and her eyes were gone. In their place were two tiny, whirring fans, cooling a cluster of glowing, violet-veined processors embedded in her skull.

""The Great Extinction didn't happen to the world,"" she whispered. Her voice was now a chorus of a thousand voices, layered and distorted. ""It happened to *reality*. In 2024, the climate didn't fail. The *physics* did. The universe began to unravel at the atomic level. We had six months before the vacuum decay reached Earth.""

She pointed into the hole in the wall. I looked.

Stretching out into an infinite, oily void were billions of ""Data Pods."" They looked like oversized, translucent human hearts, suspended in a thick, amniotic fluid. Inside each one was a person—grey, withered, and connected to a central neural trunk by thick, pulsating umbilical cords.

""We couldn't save the planet,"" she continued, her face flickering between the woman I loved and a skinless, multi-eyed thing. ""So we built the Archive. We turned the entire biomass of the human race into the hardware. We used our brains as the hard drives and our nervous systems as the fiber-optics. This 'New York' is just a simulation running on a giant, planetary-scale brain.""

But biological hardware rots.

""The Dead Pixels you see? That’s necrotic tissue,"" she said. ""The server—the brain we are all living in—is dying of old age. It’s having a stroke, Mark. And we’re the memories that are being deleted to keep the core alive.""

The ""Construction Workers"" appeared then. They weren't men; they were ten-foot-tall, spindly horrors with skin like wet vellum. They began to ""deconstruct"" the kitchen. They weren't using hammers; they were using serrated bone-needles to unspool the walls.

Behind the drywall were columns of thousands of human spinal cords, braided together to form the ""wiring"" of our life. I saw Silas, my neighbor, fused into the plumbing. His ribs had been widened into a pipe, his open mouth acting as a biological filter for the amniotic fluid that powered the grid.

The Archive began to ""Compress."" The world didn't just end; it folded.

The Scavengers—mechanical spiders made of teeth and hair—latched onto Sarah. They inserted proboscises into her neck and began to suck out her ""Memory Strips""—long, translucent ribbons of pulsating meat.

As the strips were removed, my memories of her began to vanish. I forgot the color of her eyes. I forgot our wedding day. Each strip they took was a piece of my soul being repurposed as structural ""patchwork"" for the dying server.

""David,"" she glitched, her face now a featureless slab of grey static. ""The... drive... is... full. You... are... the... next... sector.""

I am being folded now. My legs are being unzipped by a ""Maintenance Script"" to repurpose my femurs as braces for the Central Core. I am no longer a man. I am a cluster of corrupted code in a failing lung.

If you see a black dot in your kitchen tonight, don't try to clean it. It’s just the server clearing space. And you’re the file that’s about to be deleted.",10,1769232478.0,nosleep,1,0.92,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

1qlee3c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qlee3c,Violent murder of 13-year-old Vasilisa Faizova…,"Vasilisa Faizova was born in July 2009 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. She came into the world in a wonderfully loving family: Vasilisa had an older sister, Alisa, one year her senior, and a set of caring parents. Her mother, Olesya, is a talented fashion designer and seamstress who is pretty recognized in Russia. 


Ever since Vasilisa was little, it seemed that she took after her mom: little girl showed extraordinary talent in pretty much every field of arts. She had a truly beautiful singing voice and sang in a vocal studio since she was little, winning many awards and competitions. She taught herself to play the keyboard, guitar and ukulele. She drew and painted, sewed and knitted, surprising her many friends with beautifully made pieces. About a year before her tragic death, Vasilisa took a great interest in creating collages using magazine cutouts, and even held creative master classes for others in cozy coffee houses of her hometown. People of all ages and walks of life attended these creative meetings and absolutely loved Vasilisa’s creativity as well as her kind and friendly personality.


Vasilisa grew up in an atmosphere of love and kindness, and she enjoyed a beautiful relationship with both of her parents, her sister, and her grandparents. The family was very close knit and loved spending time together, especially at their countryside home. Not too long before Vasilisa’s life was taken, her father, and later grandfather, passed away. That time was very difficult for the family, and everyone was grieving. One thing remained unchanged: the remaining members of the family all supported each other and their bond grew even stronger as they were mourning their loss. 


Little did they know they’d soon have to grieve their beloved Vasya, as Vasilisa was lovingly called at home.


It’s important to note that everyone who knew Vasilisa also knew what a kind, loving soul she was. Vasilisa was very friendly and loved people with her whole heart. She’d always go above and beyond for others.


About a year or so before her death, Vasilisa made a new friend. It was a young boy named Ilya, aged 16, who preferred to be called Demyan. Demyan was quite a whimsical character; he loved to stand out from the crowd. He was known to be artistic and gifted in several areas. Vasilisa and Demyan had quite a bit in common: both loved to read, both enjoyed fine arts. Despite the age gap which can feel substantial when you’re in your teens, they were fast friends, and would often chat online about things like books or animes they both loved. Demyan was really big on acting: he participated in a theater studio. Olesya, Vasilisa’s mom, would often notice that her daughter would talk about her new friend all the time. She was not worried, though: she knew Vasilisa trusted her immensely and would come to her with anything. It seemed as if nothing was concerning about this friendship.


Little is known about Demyan’s background, but we do know he comes from a full, loving family. He was an only child and loved by his parents. When the boy was about 12, though, he confided to his mother that he felt an immense hatred for people. The worried mother took him to a child psychiatrist, and he was later put on medication. Demyan kept a journal, which would be found and read later. The journal contained detailed descriptions of his hatred for those around him and of his desire to kill others. Demyan wrote that he was never himself around other people, wearing a thousand different masks. He even went so far as to call himself a king of all hypocrites. 


Demyan had another female friend, a 15-year-old Anfisa. Anfisa was a gifted honor roll student, and was known to enjoy filming. She wanted to be a director and videographer in the future, and was quite popular with her peers. 


On April 30, 2023, Demyan and Anfisa asked Vasilisa if she would help them with a creative project. The project was about interviews with different young people, and Demyan claimed that Vasilisa would be their star guest. Unsuspecting, the young girl gladly accepted. The interview was meant to take place during a picnic in a remote area near Saint Petersburg. Vasilisa was excited to participate, and even got a whole new outfit beforehand. She trusted and looked up to Demyan and Anfisa so much, she would never even imagine they would hurt her.


Demyan asked Vasilisa a few questions, one of which was “What would you say to your loved ones if you knew you were about to die”. Vasilisa looked straight at the camera and said, *I would just give them all a big hug.*


Tragically, she would never get a chance to do that. 


While she was smiling at the camera, Demyan crept up to her from behind and started slamming Vasilisa with a hammer. The blows were so intense and so shocking, the girl fell to the ground and died within only about 20 seconds. Despite that, Demyan kept viciously attacking her body, as Anfisa was calmly filming the murder and encouraging her friend, saying “Go ahead, don’t stop”.


The teenagers then inspected Vasilisa backpack, stealing some of her possessions like a face cleanser, some money (about $10) and a powerbank. Demyan even grabbed Vasilisa’s phone to message her mom, saying “Thank you for everything, mother. I won’t be coming back home. I long to see new places and meet new people”. He then smashed the phone and threw it out. 


His cruelty did not stop there, though. He snapped a few pictures of Vasilisa’s battered body and anonymously sent them to her sister Alisa, to gloat over the tragedy. They then proceeded to wrap the body in a plastic bag and fled the scene. It’s chilling that after this heinous act, both Demyan and Anfisa just went about their business as usual, like nothing had happened. They ate out at their favorite place, walked around the city a bit, and then both went to their respective homes.


Meanwhile, Vasilisa’s family was living a nightmare. That’s how her mother later described what it was like: like life turned into a nightmare she couldnt wake up from. Each day following the murder was, and is, absolutely harrowing. Alisa, Vasilisa’s sister, was so traumatized by the ordeal that she barely talked to anyone for the following two years. 


Nothing would ever be the same again.


The young murderers were caught within the next several days. Their families hired expensive, high end lawyers, and the public was shocked and disgusted: Demyan and Anfisa were sentenced to only 7 and 6 years in the juvie respectively. As the court psychiatrist said, the fact that the two filmed the murder and how calm and reserved their demeanor on film was, means that they were deeply enjoying their actions and were unlikely to stop or change. 


I personally find this sentence disturbing and heartbreaking. They killed an innocent, trusting young girl and only got this laughable sentence. They not only killed Vasilisa, they also destroyed her family and the lives of all those who loved her. Their own souls were so dark that the light Vasilisa was shining on this world disturbed them beyond words. They couldn’t shine themselves, so they chose to destroy the light that was shining so brightly. But, they were wrong.",149,1769232311.0,ForCuriousSouls,24,0.91,False

Not dramatically. Chairs shifted. Conversations slowed down. Eyes quickly locked on. It wasn’t exactly charisma, just a light gravity that made their presence register.

They sat at a table near the window at the coffee shop one morning, knees turned toward each other, bodies relaxed. The woman spoke with her hands. The man watched with affection, he hung on every word and every gesture.

People looked at them and remembered them.

He stood across the street longer than he should have, waiting for a light that had already changed multiple times. He told himself he was only observing. Everyone noticed other people, it was normal.

But after that day, he kept seeing them.

At the grocery store, where someone asked about their weekend. At the movies, where an usher congratulated them quietly. And again at the coffee shop where it had all begun.

He learned small intricacies about them without trying.

What they ordered.

Where they sat.

How long people lingered when they spoke.

He didn’t imagine harming them. That thought never arose.

He imagined absence instead. Not as a tragedy, but as impact. He imagined the sound a room would make if they didn’t show up when expected. How many people would ask why? How long would it take before fear replaced concern?

He wondered what it felt like to matter without effort.

They woke up in his basement.

The woman came to first, panic immediately set in. Breath sharp against the tape sealing her mouth shut. The man followed seconds later, confusion turning into terror as he tested the restraints and felt them hold.

They were seated in cold metal chairs, wrists bound, ankles taped tight. The basement was dark and smelled of mildew and oil. A single bulb hung overhead, buzzing softly.

He stood above them, several feet away, holding a handgun.

Neither of them made a sound beyond breath and muffled groans. Their eyes never left the gun.

“Good,” he said. “You’re both awake.”

He didn’t raise the gun. He didn’t lower it either. He just held it, loose in his hand, as if it were part of the room. As if it were just there for effect.

He cleared his throat.

“I’m not good at speaking in front of people,” he said. “I’ve never been. But I think that’s because I ain’t never had nobody really listen before.”

He paced once, then stopped.

“You probably don’t know who I am,” he said. “That’s normal. Nobody ever does. I exist in the space people walk through on their way somewhere else.”

His words were clumsy, but deliberate.

He glanced at them, then looked away.

“You don’t,” he said. “When you walk into a place, things change. People notice. They remember you. If you don’t show up somewhere, it creates noise.”

He laughed quietly, surprised by the sound.

“I’ve lived my whole life without that. Without weight. I move through rooms silently, without altering them.”

He stepped closer, then hesitated, like he’d crossed an invisible line.

“I’ve watched you for a while,” he said. “Not because I wanted anything from you. Just because you were…proof.”

They strained against the tape, small frantic movements. He noticed, but didn’t acknowledge it.

“You love each other,” he said. “People love you. That kind of thing leaves a mark. You don’t even see them.”

He gestured vaguely, boxing them both between his fingers.

“I needed to understand what that felt like. To be close to it. To be inside it.”

His voice was shaky now, but he didn’t stop.

“I needed this moment to matter. To be permanent.”

He took a breath, steadying himself.

“That’s all.”

He walked forward and reached out, peeling the tape from their mouths.

The woman sobbed immediately. The man spoke over her, words tumbling out together.

“Please don’t kill us.”

He froze.

“What?” He said.

He looked genuinely confused.

“Kill you?”

His eyes shot to the gun in his hand. He let out a short, incredulous laugh.

“Oh,” he said softly. “I see why you’d think that.”

He shook his head once.

“No, no, no” he said. “I just wanted an audience.”

He lifted the gun, turning it inward. The movement was calm, practiced, almost relieved. Only then did their faces change. Only then did understanding arrive, too late and all at once.

“I needed to be part of your story.”

He wondered what it felt like to matter without effort.

They woke up in his basement.

The woman came to first, panic immediately set in. Breath sharp against the tape sealing her mouth shut. The man followed seconds later, confusion turning into terror as he tested the restraints and felt them hold.

They were seated in cold metal chairs, wrists bound, ankles taped tight. The basement was dark and smelled of mildew and oil. A single bulb hung overhead, buzzing softly.

He stood above them, several feet away, holding a handgun.

Neither of them made a sound beyond breath and muffled groans. Their eyes never left the gun.

“Good,” he said. “You’re both awake.”

He didn’t raise the gun. He didn’t lower it either. He just held it, loose in his hand, as if it were part of the room. As if it were just there for effect.

He cleared his throat.

“I’m not good at speaking in front of people,” he said. “I’ve never been. But I think that’s because I ain’t never had nobody really listen before.”

He paced once, then stopped.

“You probably don’t know who I am,” he said. “That’s normal. Nobody ever does. I exist in the space people walk through on their way somewhere else.”

His words were clumsy, but deliberate.

He glanced at them, then looked away.

“You don’t,” he said. “When you walk into a place, things change. People notice. They remember you. If you don’t show up somewhere, it creates noise.”

He laughed quietly, surprised by the sound.

“I’ve lived my whole life without that. Without weight. I move through rooms silently, without altering them.”

He stepped closer, then hesitated, like he’d crossed an invisible line.

“I’ve watched you for a while,” he said. “Not because I wanted anything from you. Just because you were…proof.”

They strained against the tape, small frantic movements. He noticed, but didn’t acknowledge it.

“You love each other,” he said. “People love you. That kind of thing leaves a mark. You don’t even see them.”

He gestured vaguely, boxing them both between his fingers.

“I needed to understand what that felt like. To be close to it. To be inside it.”

His voice was shaky now, but he didn’t stop.

“I needed this moment to matter. To be permanent.”

He took a breath, steadying himself.

“That’s all.”

He walked forward and reached out, peeling the tape from their mouths.

The woman sobbed immediately. The man spoke over her, words tumbling out together.

“Please don’t kill us.”

He froze.

“What?” He said.

He looked genuinely confused.

“Kill you?”

His eyes shot to the gun in his hand. He let out a short, incredulous laugh.

“Oh,” he said softly. “I see why you’d think that.”

He shook his head once.

“No, no, no” he said. “I just wanted an audience.”

He lifted the gun, turning it inward. The movement was calm, practiced, almost relieved. Only then did their faces change. Only then did understanding arrive, too late and all at once.

“I needed to be part of your story.”

Precisely I would charge 2.4% + 10 ¢ per transaction. I am wondering if this is interesting to anyone. Right now I am targeting small coffee shops, food trucks or other small businesses.

My POS offers : 

Custom branding - official app rather than square UI

Order processing

Analytics on orders, customer history, revenue etc.

I am open to adding more features if needed

If anyone finds this interesting I would love to get feedback on this idea",1,1769232226.0,POS,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

The clock ticked louder than usual, each second a hammer on her patience. Her husband, Uncle Ronnie, lounged in the living room, phone in hand, scrolling through something that made him grin—a habit he reserved for days when his best friend Briggs wasn’t around to “dick ride” him, as the family joked. To outsiders, Ronnie was the picture of success: a man who paid his bills, bought his wife roses for anniversaries, and smiled at church. But behind closed doors, he was a master of emotional erasure.

DD had learned to keep herself busy. Babysitting, running errands for others, the endless cycle of pretending not to notice how Ronnie’s shoulders slumped when she walked into the room—these became rituals. She knew his schedule by heart: mornings with her (if he wasn’t too tired), evenings with Briggs, where he’d return home  scrolling through porn he’d later mock her for the discovering of his adultery and cheap bravado, talking about other women like they were menu items.

“You don’t understand,” he’d say when she pressed him, voice low and thick with what he thought was vulnerability. “It’s just… the way I am.”

The way he was. The phrase had become a dagger. DD knew it wasn’t her. It was the title of “wife” that thrilled him—the way he could parade her in public, a trophy for his hard work. At home, she was an afterthought. A task. A reminder of responsibility.

One humid July night, as thunder muttered in the distance, DD found the bag. It lay under the bed—a plastic Walmart sack, half-buried, with a familiar logo on a box. Her hands trembled. Inside, a bundle of explicit material featuring men, their faces contorted in laughter or pleasure. Ronnie’s laugh echoed in her mind, the one he saved for his phone, sharp and joyless.

“Why?” she whispered, though no answer came.

She thought of Pastor Briggs, the man who consumed her husband’s loyalty. A lanky, silver-tongued charmer with a grin that made Ronnie soft in a way he’d never been with her. She thought of how Ronnie’d talk about Briggs’s “wild dating life” like it was a sport, how he’d mock her own mother’s heritage, her family’s traditions, anything to make himself feel superior. He doesn’t even love me like he loves other things, she realized.

The next morning, DD ate breakfast in silence. Ronnie flipped through his emails, phone face-up between them like a third guest. She watched a twitch in his jaw, the way he’d tensed when she called Briggs a “friend.”

“You ever wonder,” she began slowly, knife glinting as she cut an orange, “why a man who loves titles so much is scared of the one person who actually sees him?”

Ronnie stiffened, but his mask stayed intact. “What’s your point?”

“My point is,” she said, voice steady, “a man who’s got to tear down his own wife’s roots to build a throne? He ain’t king of nothin’. Just a kingdom of make-believe.”

The days that followed were a blur. DD sold the house, donated the rosebushes, and packed her life into boxes smaller than Ronnie’s ego. The neighborhood gossiped when the moving truck arrived. That poor thing, they said. So bitter.

But in her new apartment, where the walls held only her art and her silence, DD texted Briggs an invitation to coffee. “Tell Ronnie,” she wrote, “it was nice while it lasted.”

When the truth reached Chester—Ronnie’s double life, his cruelty—neighbors who once praised him hesitated. The “good man” became a cautionary tale. DD, in the end, became the author of her own story.

And every time Ronnie’s name came up in conversation, she’d smile. After all, the only man he’d managed to ruin was himself.",1,1769231331.0,u_Efficient_Count_5689,0,1.0,False

1qle1j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindDecoding/comments/1qle1j3/the_psychology_of_mental_breakdown_8/,The Psychology of Mental Breakdown: 8 Science-Backed Warning Signs You're Missing,"Studied mental health for years and noticed something wild: most people don't realize they're breaking down until they're already deep in it. Your brain is incredibly good at hiding its own decline. It's like watching a pot slowly boil; you don't notice the temperature rising until it's too late.

This isn't some random observation. I have compiled insights from top psychiatrists, neuroscience research, and countless hours of podcasts with mental health experts. These signs are backed by science, not vibes.

The 8 warning signs most people miss:

**Your sleep schedule is completely fucked**

Not just ""I stayed up late. ""I mean, your circadian rhythm is destroyed. You're exhausted but can't sleep, or you're sleeping 12 hours and still feeling drained.

Why this happens: Your stress hormones (cortisol) are firing at the wrong times. Your brain's threat detection system thinks it's 3 AM during a lion attack every single night.

Try the Insight Timer app for sleep meditations. It's free, has thousands of guided sessions, and unlike other meditation apps, it doesn't bombard you with premium upsells. The sleep stories by Danielle LaPorte are insanely good for quieting racing thoughts.

**You can't remember basic shit**

Walking into rooms and forgetting why. Missing appointments. Forgetting conversations you literally just had.

The science: Chronic stress shrinks your hippocampus (memory center). Your brain is prioritizing survival over storing new information.

Read ""Why We Sleep"" by Matthew Walker (neuroscientist and sleep researcher at UC Berkeley). This book will make you question everything you think you know about rest and mental health. He breaks down how sleep deprivation literally mimics symptoms of mental illness.

**Everything feels physically heavy**

Your body aches for no reason. Getting out of bed feels like moving through concrete. Even showering is exhausting.

This isn't laziness. ""[The Body Keeps the Score](https://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0143127748)"" by Bessel van der Kolk explains how trauma and stress literally live in your nervous system. Van der Kolk is a psychiatrist who spent 40 years studying trauma; this book won best psychology book awards everywhere. The chapter on how your body stores emotional pain is mind-blowing.

**You are either numb or overwhelmed, no in-between**

One moment you feel nothing. The next, you're crying over a grocery store being out of your favorite snacks.

What's happening: Your emotional regulation system is overloaded. Think of it like a circuit breaker constantly flipping on and off.

Try the [Finch app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748) for gentle daily check-ins. It's a self-care pet app that helps you track mood patterns without feeling clinical or judgmental. Plus the little bird is cute as hell and sends you supportive messages.

**Social interaction feels impossible**

Seeing texts and feeling immediate dread. Canceling plans repeatedly. Preferring to be alone but feeling lonely when you are.

Not your fault: Social connection requires energy your depleted nervous system doesn't have. Your brain is in survival mode; it's conserving resources.

**You're doom-scrolling for hours**

Picking up your phone and losing 3 hours to TikTok or Reddit. Using screens to avoid being alone with your thoughts.

The trap: Short-term dopamine hits make you feel temporarily better but, in the long term, worsen depression.

Listen to ""The Happiness Lab"" podcast by Dr. Laurie Santos (Yale psychology professor). Her episode on phone addiction and mental health is chef's kiss. She breaks down the neuroscience of why we scroll and practical ways to break the cycle.

**Your eating is all over the place**

Either not eating or stress-eating everything. Food has lost taste. You're surviving on coffee and random snacks.

Why: Your gut-brain connection is real. Stress hormones mess with hunger signals and digestion.

**You're thinking ""I'm fine"" constantly**

Convincing yourself and others you're okay while internally screaming. Functioning at work but completely falling apart at home.

This is called high-functioning depression. You're not fine; you're just really good at performing fine.

Read ""Lost Connections"" by Johann Hari (a journalist who spent years researching depression causes). This book challenges everything mainstream psychology tells you about depression. Hari traveled the world interviewing researchers and found that depression often isn't just a chemical imbalance; it's your brain responding logically to an illogical world.

**What actually helps**

Talk to someone professional, seriously. Not just friends. Therapists are trained to spot patterns you can't see. If money is tight, check out Open Path Collective (therapy sessions starting at $30-$80) or BetterHelp for online options.

For structured self-learning, there's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), an AI-powered learning app built by Columbia alumni and Google AI experts. It pulls from psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned above to create personalized audio content. You can customize the depth (quick 15-min overview or 40-min deep dive with examples) and voice style. What's useful here is the adaptive learning plan feature; you tell it your specific struggle, like ""managing high-functioning depression"" or ""breaking doom-scrolling habits,"" and it builds a science-based plan just for you. The content pulls from verified sources and keeps evolving as you learn.

The ""[Huberman Lab](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/dr-andrew-huberman-part-2-reduce-anxiety-stress-for/id1457268944?i=1000682918792)"" podcast episode on stress with Dr. Andrew Huberman is gold. He's a Stanford neuroscientist who explains the biological mechanisms of stress and gives science-backed protocols for managing it. The breathing technique he teaches literally resets your nervous system in 5 minutes.

Get sunlight within 30 minutes of waking. Sounds stupidly simple, but it regulates cortisol and helps fix sleep. Even 10 minutes outside matters.

Move your body, any amount. Not ""go to the gym and lift heavy"" (though that helps). Just walk. Your brain needs movement to process stress hormones.

Look, breaking down mentally doesn't mean you're weak or broken. Your brain is doing exactly what it's designed to do when overwhelmed; it's trying to protect you. These signs are your nervous system waving red flags, begging you to slow down and address what's happening.

You're not imagining this. The exhaustion is real, the brain fog is real, and the emotional dysregulation is real. And it's manageable with the right tools and support. Please take these signs seriously before the pot boils over.",1,1769231250.0,MindDecoding,0,1.0,False

1qldyln,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qldyln/how_to_make_people_like_you_instantly_psychology/,How to make people like you instantly: psychology tricks backed by SCIENCE (not TikTok nonsense),"Let’s be real. Most of us aren't born with off-the-charts charm. And if you’ve ever caught yourself overthinking every word in a conversation or wondering *why* some people just “have it,” you’re not alone. We all want to be liked. Whether it’s making friends faster, getting a job, or not being the awkward one at a party, likability opens a lot of doors.

But here’s the thing: most of the advice floating around on TikTok and IG is just... cringe. Stuff like “mirror their pose” or “make intense eye contact” can feel robotic and flat-out weird if you don’t know the context. So this post is your shortcut to *real*, *evidence-backed* techniques that actually work. Pulled from psychology research, top behavioral science books, and underrated podcasts, here’s the no-BS guide to becoming instantly more likable.

*You don’t need to fake anything. You just need to *learn* how likability works and use it intentionally.*

*Here are the practical tricks that actually work:*

* **Use the “exposure effect” hack (without creeping people out)**
  * *This comes from social psychology research on the “mere exposure effect,” which shows we like people more the more we see them.*  
    - A classic study by psychologist Robert Zajonc found that people rate strangers as more attractive and trustworthy simply by seeing their faces multiple times.  
    - So if you're shy? Start by just being present. Don’t try to impress. Just show up consistently and casually where your target group hangs out. Visibility builds familiarity, and familiarity breeds connection.

* **Be a “highlighter,” not a spotlight stealer**
  * *People like people who make them feel seen.* Noticed this in the book *Captivate* by Vanessa Van Edwards: good conversationalists ask curious questions and celebrate others’ wins.  
    - Ask others about their interests, but go one level deeper. Instead of “What do you do?”, try “What’s your favorite part about your job?”  
    - Then reflect their excitement back to them with your tone or facial expression. This is called “emotional mirroring,” and it builds fast trust.

* **The “pratfall effect”: reveal a small flaw**
  * *This one’s gold.* Research from psychologist Elliot Aronson found that people who appear competent and make a small blunder (like spilling coffee) are seen as *more* likable than those who seem perfect.  
    - Perfection creates distance. A little mistake makes you *relatable*. So don’t over-polish everything you say. Let yourself trip up. Laugh at yourself. It creates warmth.

* **Name people’s emotions before giving any advice or reaction**
  * This shows *empathy*, which is a likability superpower. In his book [*Never Split the Difference*](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/0062407805), ex-FBI negotiator Chris Voss teaches the tactic of “labeling”:  
    - Say things like “Sounds like that was overwhelming” or “Seems like you were frustrated” before offering a solution.  
    - Studies from UC Berkeley show this technique calms the nervous system and makes you appear more emotionally intelligent.

* **Use the “Ben Franklin effect”**
  * *People like you more when they do you a favor.*  
    - Research shows that asking someone to do a small favor for you (like borrowing a book or asking for their opinion) increases their positive feelings toward you.  
    - It works because we unconsciously justify the favor by deciding we must like the person.  
    - This was first revealed by Ben Franklin himself in his autobiography and later confirmed by a study published in the *Journal of Applied Social Psychology*. It’s weird but real.

* **Time your compliments like this**
  * Compliments work best when they are specific, *slightly delayed*, and about *non-obvious traits*.  
    - Instead of “You’re so nice,” say “I noticed how you remembered everyone’s name in that meeting. That stuck with me.”  
    - Delayed compliments (e.g., texting someone the day after a hangout to mention something you liked about them) feel more genuine because they weren’t “on the spot.”

* **Mirror *vibe*, not posture**
  * A lot of content says to mirror someone’s gestures to build rapport. That *can* work, but it often backfires if done mechanically.  
    - Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology suggests what matters more is “affective synchrony”, matching energy, tone, and emotional state.  
    - If someone’s relaxed and low-key, match that. Don’t come in hyper. If they’re excited, match that vibe.  
    - It’s about syncing emotional tempo, not copying gestures.

* **Learn someone’s “self-story” and reflect it**
  * This tip came from a behavioral coach on Shane Parrish’s [*The Knowledge Project*](https://www.youtube.com/@tkppodcast) podcast. Every person has a self-identity story they’re trying to protect.  
    - If someone sees themselves as “the helper,” thank them for always stepping in.  
    - If they see themselves as “the smart one,” ask for their opinion on something complicated.  
    - This subtle validation creates instant connection. People love those who see them the way they want to be seen.

* **Use warm words, not just smart ones**
  * A study by Princeton psychologists Susan Fiske and Alexander Todorov found that *warmth* and *competence* are the two key traits people judge immediately.  
    - But warmth weighs more heavily in first impressions.  
    - So instead of trying to sound impressive or clever, focus on being approachable and open.  
    - Use words like “we,” “together,” “curious,” “interested,” instead of “I,” “me,” or “let me tell you.”

None of this requires you to be fake. No cheesy tricks. No manipulation. Just real, human psychology that builds faster trust and real relationships.

And none of it is “natural” , it’s all learnable. Which means if you’ve ever felt socially awkward or ""not magnetic,"" that can totally change. Likability isn’t some mysterious trait. It’s a *skill*.

It’s Only Monday. And the Universe Just Moved In.
Marques Latrell was supposed to have a normal Monday in Philadelphia—coffee, freelance hustles, ignoring his mother’s calls.
Instead, six entire planets arrive in Earth’s sky.
When alien worlds take refuge in our solar system, humanity is forced to confront a truth it was never prepared for: the universe is vast, ancient, and already at war. While governments scramble and social movements fracture under fear and wonder, Marques discovers something far more dangerous than alien refugees.
He is connected to them.
Haunted by visions, hunted by forces he doesn’t understand, and surrounded by people projecting their hopes, fears, and ideologies onto him, Marques begins to realize that the power awakening inside him is not a gift—it’s a test. One that has destroyed civilizations before.
As protests erupt, conspiracies spread, and a genocidal enemy known as the Dead Eaters advances toward Earth, Marques is pulled into a conflict where morality bends under survival, power reshapes belief, and heroes are not chosen—they are manufactured.

However, the most recent account of robbery I could find was from about a year ago. Has anyone heard about anything from more recently or have some info on the current situation?

We would prefer not to use a guide service (except maybe for Tajumulco mostly just for logistics of getting to the mountain) because we are very experienced hikers and trying to travel as cheaply as possible, and from what I've read online it seems like robbers will attack you whether you have a local guide with you or not! I read first hand accounts of this happening many times.

I've also read online that you can get a police escort to come with you, though I haven't come across a single instance of anyone actually doing this.

I asked our translator at our coffee tour yesterday in Antigua (specifically about Volcan Agua). He has lived here his whole life and told us he's never heard of anyone getting robbed on that trail.

We also plan to do the popular Acatenango/Fuego hike which seems very safe, but we were hoping to have a couple less-touristy volcano experiences as well.

If we were to do any of these hikes we would of course leave valuables at home and not bring much cash, however I think we would need at least one cell phone for navigation which would be the biggest loss if we were to get robbed.

But it had been a long two hours of crying and discomfort to get her to sleep. Her tummy had been unsettled, lots of cute little toots. New food was always difficult, but she would grow out of it, he had been the same.

Easing his arm from under her, he cursed himself for letting her fall asleep with his arm as a pillow. He caught her head as it slipped off his arm and laid it gently on the bed. Now he had to get free of the bed without dipping the mattress too far.

She was curled up now, little hands tucked under her chin, her legs curled up, so much like how she slept as a newborn that his heart hurt. He paused at the door, watching her ribs expand and contract with her breathing.

He forced himself to close the door, leaving just a crack so he could hear her if she cried. He took two steps down the hallway when he heard her thin reedy cry. Frustration swept through him instantly, a flash of anger in his heart.

Pressing his fingers to his eyes, he took a long deep breath, steadying himself. Her cries increased, starting to warble as the volume rose. 

With a push, the door swung open, and his daughter was sat up in bed, staring at the corner of the room. He glanced at it, expecting a shadow or a misshapen lump of clothes.

A figure was hunched in the corner, taller than the ceiling. He shouted, running to his daughter and scooping her up. Her fingers clung to his clothes, her scream silenced against his neck as he ran.

He caught a glimpse of long fingers over his shoulder, the tip of one touching his daughter’s fine white hair. A spark of flame drove the touch away, almost making him stumble in surprise.

Not stopping to put shoes on, he fled their home, out into the night that was quickly clouding over. Rain came in a sudden deluge, soaking them both to the skin. But he couldn’t stop, couldn’t go back to their home.

They were out on the street, cold and afraid. 

Headlights washed over him and he jumped back with a shout, the car screeching to a stop just before where he had been standing. The window rolled down, dark hair immediately soaked as a head popped out.

“Shit! I’m sorry. I didn’t see you. The rain just started bucketing down. Are you okay?” The question came sharply.

“W-we’re fine.” He muttered, trying not to shiver in the cold.

“You’re both soaked.”

He scuffed a bare foot against the ground. “Got kicked out.” He lied.

Visions began to roll through his mind, blinding him to the present. He forced them away, clinging to the woman’s words as she invited them into her car. The gutters were overflowing as he splashed to the door and slipped in, clutching his daughter tightly.

“Sorry. Thank you.” He muttered.

“I’m Rae.” She held out a hand.

He took it gently. “Jet. And this is Soul. My daughter.”

Rae gave him a bright smile as she guided the car back onto the road. “There’s a place around the corner we can get some coffee and warm up. I’ll be careful driving with her in the car.” A pause. “She’s beautiful.”

He smiled softly, pressing a soft kiss to Soul’s brow. “She is.”",1,1769230912.0,JAKnight,0,1.0,False
1qldwku,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsetConqueror/comments/1qldwku/how_to_influence_without_being_obvious_the/,How to Influence Without Being Obvious: The Psychology Playbook That Actually Works,"So I've been down a rabbit hole studying influence for the past year. Books, podcasts, and behavioral psychology research. Not the manipulative BS, but genuine influence. The kind where people don't realize they're being persuaded because it feels natural.

Here's what blew my mind: most of us try way too hard. We think influence means being the loudest person in the room or having the best argument. Wrong. The most influential people barely seem like they're trying at all.

Real influence happens in the gaps. It's about understanding how our brains work and working WITH human psychology instead of against it. Let me share what I've learned from digging into the research and testing this stuff in real life. 



*Give people ownership over ideas.*

Stop trying to convince people of your point. Instead, ask questions that lead them to your conclusion on their own. When someone arrives at an idea themselves, they defend it like it's their baby. This is called the ""self-generation effect,"" and it's ridiculously powerful.

Instead of ""We should do X,"" try ""What if we approached this from Y angle?"" Let them connect the dots. Their brain releases dopamine when they solve the puzzle, and suddenly, your idea becomes their brilliant thought. 



*The reciprocity loop.*

Do small favors without keeping score. Bring someone coffee. Share an article they'd like. Make an intro. Don't ask for anything back immediately or ever, really. Psychologist Robert Cialdini calls this the reciprocity principle; humans are hardwired to return favors. But here's the key: it has to be genuine. People can smell transactional energy from a mile away.

I started doing this at work six months ago. Just helping people with zero agenda. Now, when I need something, people actually WANT to help me. It's wild. 



*Mirror and pace.*

This comes from neurolinguistic programming research. Subtly match someone's body language, speaking pace, and energy level. Not in a creepy way, just naturally. If they're leaning back and relaxed, you lean back. If they talk fast, you speed up a bit.

Why does this work? Mirror neurons. Our brains literally light up when we see someone mirroring us. It creates unconscious rapport and trust. You become ""one of them"" without anyone noticing. ""[Atomic Habits](https://a.co/d/8ZlrU0B)"" by James Clear has a great section on identity-based behavior change that touches on this. Clear is a behavior change expert who's helped millions build better systems. The book won't just teach you about habits, it'll rewire how you think about influence entirely. This is hands down the best practical psychology book I've read. 



*Strategic silence.*

Most people are terrified of silence in conversation. They fill every gap with words. Don't. When you make a point, shut up and let it land. The silence creates tension that the other person rushes to fill, usually by agreeing or expanding on YOUR point.

Negotiation experts use this constantly. After you state your price or position, just sit there. The first person to speak usually loses. Uncomfortable? Yes. Effective? Absolutely. 



*Social proof, but make it subtle.*

Instead of ""Everyone's doing this,"" try ""I noticed Sarah and the team had success with this approach."" Specific examples feel authentic. Vague claims feel like you're trying too hard.

The podcast ""[Hidden Brain](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hidden-brain/id1028908750)"" with Shankar Vedantam digs into the unconscious patterns that drive behavior. Vedantam is a science journalist who breaks down complex research into stories you actually remember. There's an episode on social influence that'll change how you see every interaction. Insanely good listen. 



*Validation before redirection.*

Before disagreeing with someone, validate their concern first. ""I totally see why you'd think that,"" or ""That makes sense given X."" Their defenses drop because you're not attacking. Then you can gently redirect: ""Have you considered...""

This technique comes from motivational interviewing, a counseling method. But it works everywhere. ""[Never Split the Difference](https://a.co/d/4JoFuCR)"" by Chris Voss teaches this brilliantly. Voss was the FBI's lead hostage negotiator; he literally used these techniques to save lives. The book is full of ""tactical empathy"" strategies that feel like mind-reading. You'll question everything you thought you knew about persuasion. 



*The consistency trap.*

Get small agreements first. If someone says yes to something tiny, they're more likely to say yes to bigger asks later. Their brain wants to stay consistent with previous behavior.

Start with ""Can I get your opinion on something?"" before asking for their help on a project. You're building a yes pattern. 



*Anchor high.*

When presenting options, start with the most ambitious version. It makes your real ask seem reasonable by comparison. This is the anchoring bias in action. The first number you hear becomes the reference point for everything after.

Instead of ""Can we get a 5% budget increase?"" try ""Ideally, we'd get 15%, but I think 8% would let us hit our goals."" That 8% now feels like a compromise. 



*Frame outcomes, not features.*

People don't care about what something IS; they care about what it DOES for them. Don't say ""This software has X feature."" Say ""You'll save 3 hours a week and leave work on time.""

Worth mentioning, there's an AI learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from books like the ones above, plus psychology research papers and expert interviews on persuasion and behavioral science. You type in a goal like ""become more influential without seeming pushy,"" and it generates personalized audio learning plans with all the relevant insights. Built by Columbia grads and former Google AI folks. 

What's useful is the depth control; you can do a quick 10-minute overview or switch to a 40-minute deep dive with actual examples and case studies when something clicks. The voice options are surprisingly good, too. There's this smooth, conversational style that makes complex psychology research way easier to absorb during commutes. It connects the dots between all these influence principles in a structured way that actually sticks.

Look, none of this is about manipulation. It's about understanding that humans aren't rational creatures; we're emotional ones. The best influencers know this and speak to both the logical AND emotional brain.

The difference between being persuasive and being pushy is simple: pushy people make it about them. Influential people make it about the other person. When someone feels heard, understood, and like the idea benefits THEM, influence happens naturally.

Start small. Pick one of these techniques and practice it this week. Watch what happens. The beautiful thing about influence is that it compounds. The more you use these principles, the more natural they become, and the less ""obvious"" you are.

A girl in my class (she’s probably 19–20) came up to me after lecture, we talked, and she voluntarily gave me her number. Since then we’ve been texting mostly about class like homework, assignments, she even sent me an old midterm she took a couple years ago and leaves voice notes. She’s friendly, encouraging, and easy to talk to.

But I’ve learned not to read into this anymore.

She’s from Dubai, plans to move back eventually, and comes from a completely different background but she's very ""americanized"" if that makes sense. The energy feels more like “nice classmate” than anything romantic, even though sometimes the conversation feels warm and engaging. I keep catching myself wondering if there’s more, and then immediately shutting it down because I don’t want to be delusional again.

This has happened to me before. I once met a girl who later cried and told me how much she appreciated me talking to her because she was lonely. She gave me her number, agreed to coffee, and then it never happened. That experience stuck with me.

Now I feel like I’m always the guy people feel comfortable with (helpful, safe, emotionally available) but never the guy someone actually wants. I don’t blame her or anyone else. I just feel tired of getting small sparks of hope and having to extinguish them myself before they turn into disappointment.

I don’t even know what I’m asking. I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest.",1,1769230776.0,ForeverAlone,0,1.0,False

There’s a version of home defense that gets sold online—clean, decisive, and finished the moment the threat drops. What almost never gets discussed is what happens after the noise stops. That’s where real injuries, preventable deaths, and long-term consequences begin—especially in tight suburban environments with thin walls and people you care about nearby.  
  
This video is for suburban preppers, families, and anyone serious about medical readiness who understands that survival doesn’t end when rounds are fired. I’m breaking down ammunition choice from a medical and preparedness perspective—based on real gunshot injuries I’ve treated in combat zones, medical evacuation, and civilian emergency departments as a former 160th SOAR flight medic and current Nurse Practitioner.

They know I do a lot of camping and sometimes head out to the range for a shoot. There is one particular staff member there that is rather prickly. She is probably in her 60's and quite dry and humourless. She makes basic conversation and just after Xmas last year, while she was making my coffee  she asked what we got our kids for Xmas. I told her that my youngest son (13) got an upgraded suspension for his mountain bike and my oldest son (15) wanted a new eBike but they were too expensive so he got a new scope for his rifle. As she passed me my freshly brewed coffee she looked over her glasses and said, word for word 'Well I hope he doesn't grab his rifle and shoot up his school because he didn't get what he wanted for Xmas.' Then she turned and served the next customer. I stood there shocked. She has met my boys. Both a bright, smart and respectable kids. This reaction left me speechless. Next visit i mentioned her comment to the manager. She apologised profusely and said she would have a word with her.

However, the most recent account of robbery I could find was from about a year ago. Has anyone heard about anything from more recently or have some info on the current situation?

We would prefer not to use a guide service (except maybe for Tajumulco mostly just for logistics of getting to the mountain) because we are very experienced hikers and trying to travel as cheaply as possible, and from what I've read online it seems like robbers will attack you whether you have a local guide with you or not! I read first hand accounts of this happening many times. 

I've also read online that you can get a police escort to come with you, though I haven't come across a single instance of anyone actually doing this.

I asked our translator at our coffee tour yesterday in Antigua (specifically about Volcan Agua). He has lived here his whole life and told us he's never heard of anyone getting robbed on that trail. 

We also plan to do the popular Acatenango/Fuego hike which seems very safe, but we were hoping to have a couple less-touristy volcano experiences as well. 

If we were to do any of these hikes we would of course leave valuables at home and not bring much cash, however I think we would need at least one cell phone for navigation which would be the biggest loss if we were to get robbed.

After requesting a month of sick leave, I slipped away to the hospital to end the pregnancy I never planned. Yet right at the entrance to the military base, that familiar army-plated SUV blocked my path.

Franklin Durham, the commanding officer respected throughout the region, was still in his service uniform. He stepped out of the vehicle with long strides, his expression tight with suppressed anger as he demanded, ""Why are you aborting our baby?""

I lifted my chin, fighting back the tears that threatened to spill. ""You're the powerful commander,"" I said, my voice tight. ""But I'm just a civilian clerk working at the base. We never meant to be together, so what's the point of keeping it?""

He rubbed his temples and picked me up in his arms. ""Keep the baby. I'll marry you.""

Soon after, he gave me a wedding—one that went ahead despite opposition from his family and scrutiny from everyone on base. It wasn't extravagant, but it was solemn and sincere. I later miscarried. Even so, Franklin continued to dote on me without restraint, spoiling me until I became the most envied woman in the on-base housing community.

But three years later, I discovered a photo in Franklin's album—a profile shot of an unfamiliar woman arranging flowers. She had a gentle, graceful presence, her eyes soft.

I clutched the album, ready to confront him. But at the amusement park near the base housing area, I saw Franklin holding a little boy on the carousel. Alayna Greene, the woman from the photograph, stood nearby, watching them with a tender gaze. The scene looked exactly like a picture-perfect family of three.

As I rushed over, she instinctively pulled the child closer to her. Her tone was polite and gentle. ""Ms. Westerdale, please don't misunderstand,"" she said. ""My son wanted to thank Frank for helping him, so we invited him along.""

As she spoke, she tugged at Franklin's sleeve, as if to soothe the situation. ""Frank, let's not upset Ms. Westerdale because of Ollie and me. We'll head back now.""

She didn't provoke me or flaunt her closeness with Franklin. Her perfectly measured retreat and thoughtfulness just made me seem unreasonable by comparison.

That night, I wrecked our home, leaving everything in complete disarray. When I confronted Franklin, he merely explained in a flat tone, ""A few days ago, I suddenly got sick and fainted during training. Aly saved me. Looking after her and Oliver is simply repaying a debt of gratitude—nothing more than that. Milla, she's no threat to you. Please, stop making a scene.""

I stopped arguing, quietly packing my things, ready to file for divorce. Yet right then, I discovered I was pregnant again. For the sake of this baby, I chose to compromise. I kept telling myself that once Franklin had returned the favor, everything would be back on track.

Yet the news that followed completely shattered my last shred of hope—he had publicly acknowledged himself as Oliver Greene's father at the military region's kindergarten.

Chapter 2

He canceled a crucial joint military exercise across regions just to celebrate Alayna's birthday. Worse still, under the guise of a field training exercise, he staged an absurdly romantic ""volcanic eruption"" for the mother and son at a campsite near the base.

The day I stormed into headquarters demanding answers, I happened to run into Oliver on my way out. I hadn't laid a finger on him, yet that night, the boy developed a high fever and cried nonstop. To make matters worse, the security cameras in the area were malfunctioning, and there were no other witnesses. Overnight, I became the prime suspect with no way to prove my innocence.

That night, heavy rain poured down. Franklin made me kneel in the rain on the training field and confess to a crime I didn't commit, just because he believed I had caused Oliver's fever.

The rain was icy and soaked through my clothes. I instinctively protected my lower abdomen. I looked up at the man I had loved for years and spoke slowly and clearly, ""Franklin, I, Camilla Westerdale, have always lived with integrity. I would never stoop to hurting a child. I won't confess to a crime I didn't commit.""

I started to leave, but his words stopped me in my tracks. ""Camilla, after living on base all these years, you've actually forgotten who calls the shots around here.""

I stopped in my tracks and turned around, shocked. There was a time when Franklin would defend me if anyone looked down on my background. Now, for another woman, he used his rank to pressure me. He was forcing me to kneel and confess to something I hadn't done.

A guard stepped forward at Franklin's signal and grabbed my arm. I didn't resist. Slowly, I sank to my knees in the freezing rain.

He looked down at me, disappointment clear in his eyes. ""Have I spoiled you too much all these years that you've forgotten how to behave?""

I looked into his cold eyes. My lips parted, but I realized nothing I said would matter.

Franklin's phone rang. He checked the caller ID and answered right away. His voice was urgent and gentle, a tone I hadn't heard in a long time. ""Aly, don't be afraid. I'll be right there.""

He hung up and rushed out. As he passed me, his steps never slowed. He gave a cold, sharp order. ""Kneel here for 12 full hours. If you cut it even a minute short, you know what will happen.""

Watching his retreating figure, a sharp pain pierced my heart. After over a decade of dreaming, perhaps it was finally time to wake up.

The rain continued all night. At dawn's first light, I used my numb, freezing hands to make a phone call. Franklin's father, Howard Durham—the respected senior military leader—answered. ""Sir. Durham,"" I said, ""you've always wanted Franklin to divorce me and proceed with the arranged marriage your family planned, right? I accept.""

Chapter 3

Howard chuckled quietly, as though he had been waiting for this moment for a long time. ""Excellent. Someone will help you both with the divorce process tomorrow. After the one-month cooling-off period, you'll get the compensation you deserve. It will be enough for you to live comfortably for the rest of your life. But if Franklin finds out about any of this beforehand, you won't get any money, and you'll also lose the right to your parents' burial plots in the military cemetery.""

In the hospital corridor, I leaned against the wall, my face pale as I shuffled along. The cramping pain in my abdomen was a constant reminder of everything I'd just lost. The doctor's words still echoed in my mind. ""Ms. Westerdale, your body was already poorly suited for pregnancy. After this procedure, I'm afraid it will be extremely difficult for you to conceive again.""

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. This decision was painful, but I had no regrets. When Franklin blamed me for Alayna's sake, our fate was sealed. Our marriage was always going to end.

Just as I was about to leave, my gaze drifted through the slightly ajar ward door. There was Franklin, down on one knee, engaged in a toy car game with Oliver. Alayna sat nearby, carefully cutting a peeled apple into small pieces and gently offering them to the two of them.

The scene I had pictured in my mind so many times had finally happened, but I was no longer the main character.

Noticing how pale I looked, a nurse asked gently, ""Ma'am, where are your family members? Should I help you contact them?""

I glanced toward the room echoing with laughter and happy voices. My voice was completely flat. ""That won't be necessary. I have no family.""

I straightened my back and forced myself to walk toward the elevator. Behind me, the nurse's whispered words drifted faintly. ""It's so pitiful to go through a surgery like this all alone.""

Back at my quarters on base, I began to clear away every last trace of Franklin. All the mementos he had given me went straight into the trash. I told the guard to take down the wedding photo that was hanging in the living room—inside the frame, under the starry sky of the plateau outpost, I was wearing a pure white wedding dress, smiling brightly. Franklin stood beside me, his eyes soft and tender.

I looked at it in silence for a moment, then pulled out a dagger and scratched Franklin's face in the photo until it was unrecognizable.

The bodyguard stood off to the side, looking uncomfortable as he tried to talk me out of it. ""Mrs. Durham, you and Commander Durham waited six months to take this wedding photo at the outpost. That was a rare and spectacular starry sky.""

My hand didn't stop. The blade scraped across the photo with a sharp, grating sound. I spoke quietly, ""No matter how breathtaking the scenery is, it fades in the end. Just like the profound love that once was known to the entire military region, it ultimately cannot escape the unchanging law of how fickle the human heart can be.""

That night, Franklin brought Alayna and Oliver home. He said firmly, ""Milla, Aly hasn't been feeling well, and it's too hard for her to take care of Oliver alone. There are plenty of staff on base, so it'll be easier to look after her. They'll stay with us for the time being.""

I didn't look up. I just answered loudly, ""Fine.""

My quick answer seemed to surprise Franklin. He glanced at me, noticing how I kept my head down, and a flicker of relief passed through his eyes.

Chapter 4

Alayna stepped forward at the right moment with a gentle smile. ""Ms. Westerdale, thank you for letting us stay here temporarily. We're very sorry to have inconvenienced you.""

While she spoke, she gently stroked Oliver's head and said quietly, ""Ollie, go on and give the gift to this nice lady.""

The little boy shyly held out a handmade cloth doll. As soon as my fingertips touched it, I pulled my hand back in pain. Blood oozed from my fingers because a long needle was hidden inside the doll's clothes.

The child was scared by my reaction and started to cry. Alayna's face went pale. She quickly pulled the child behind her, her voice shaking with tears. ""Ms. Westerdale, I'm so sorry. This doll was made by Ollie himself. He just didn't finish the stitches properly. He absolutely didn't do this on purpose.""

I remained silent and reached for a tissue to tend to the wound. Suddenly, Franklin stepped in to shield Alayna and Oliver, shoving me back as he snapped, ""What do you think you're doing? It's just a small cut. The child didn't mean it. Why are you making such a fuss?""

The push made me stumble, and my lower back hit the sharp corner of the coffee table. Pain shot through me, making it hard to see clearly or even stand. I saw panic in Franklin's eyes as he fussed over Alayna, and I noticed how she held the child close. Suddenly, I felt completely exhausted. All the arguments and anger seemed pointless. Getting angry at someone who no longer loved me just felt humiliating.

I averted my gaze, turned slowly, and made my way upstairs.

Three days later, the military region hosted a joint condolence dinner. For the first time, Franklin brought me along, and Alayna came with us as his assistant.

Halfway through the banquet, a man who had been drinking walked up to Franklin and said in a teasing tone, ""Commander Durham, word has it that you've recently changed your taste and you're quite fond of this Ms. Greene, who is a single mother.""

As soon as he spoke, the room went silent. Many curious or disapproving gazes turned to Alayna.

""I knew it! I thought they seemed unusually close. So Ms. Greene is Commander Durham's mistress after all.""

""You haven't heard? They say Ms. Greene was only 18 when she had the baby. To catch a high-ranking commander's eye while being a single mother, she must have some great skills.""

Alayna went pale, her eyes turning red. She looked at Franklin, clearly unsure of what to do.

Franklin smashed his wine glass on the floor, shards scattering everywhere. He grabbed the man by the collar and punched him hard in the face, not stopping until the man collapsed. Then Franklin looked around the room and said in a cold, steady voice, ""Listen up, everyone. Aly is my woman, and Ollie is my flesh and blood. Anyone who dares to utter another word of gossip will be making an enemy of the entire region!""

I froze, a sudden urge to laugh rising in my chest. So this was what Franklin meant by ""repaying a debt of gratitude""—was that really all it was?

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone looked at me. Instead of envy or respect, I saw only pity and mockery. I used to be Mrs. Durham, the woman he treasured, but now I was the laughingstock of the banquet.

Chapter 5

I stayed silent and tightened my grip on the wine glass.

The banquet ended badly, and the ride back to the base housing was silent. Franklin looked furious, while Alayna leaned against him, quietly sobbing.

As the car came to a stop, I moved to get out, but Franklin yanked me back violently. A sharp slap struck my face. His eyes burned with fury as he snarled, ""Camilla, I warned you. Don't ever cause such a disgraceful scene again!""

I held my swelling cheek and looked up at him in disbelief. ""Franklin, have you lost your mind? What does this have to do with me?""

He cut me off. ""Do you really think ruining their reputations will make me stay with you? Let me tell you, it's nothing but wishful thinking!""

He turned away from me, addressing the guard instead. ""Notify the relevant department tomorrow and start the process to make me Ollie's legal guardian. Starting today, Aly gets all the privileges and treatment given to a commander's wife.""

Franklin paused, his gaze fixed on me. He said with an icy voice, ""I warned you—what I can give, I can also take away. Since you refuse to learn your place, starting today, you'll move to the service quarters on base. Stay there and learn some discipline. From now on, you'll personally attend to Aly and Ollie's daily needs.""

I looked at the man I'd loved for ten years, a faint, bitter smile touching my lips. How absurd—he hadn't even bothered to investigate before pinning false accusations on me. A decade of devotion, and it hadn't earned me even a shred of trust.

I gave him one final look, my eyes as still and calm as stagnant water. No arguments, no tears—just standing tall as I gathered a few old belongings and walked back to the house where I'd spent my childhood.

Franklin acted quickly. By the next day, he'd completed all the legal proceedings. Oliver was formally adopted into the Durham family, becoming his legitimate son.

Soon after, Franklin had to leave for an urgent three-day business trip to join a border patrol mission.

On the day Franklin left, Alayna stopped pretending. At dinner, she acted like she owned the place, sitting confidently in the seat that used to be mine.

Halfway through dinner, Alayna suddenly gasped. The plate of soup she was holding slipped and shattered at my feet. A guard was about to help, but she waved him away. She raised an eyebrow at me, a smug smile curling across her face. ""Camilla, come here. Frank specifically ordered you to take personal care of us. You can handle such a trivial task, can't you?""

I took a deep breath, grabbed a rag, and knelt down. As I reached for the broken pieces, Alayna gave Oliver a small nudge. He understood right away, walked quietly behind me, and gave me a hard shove.

""Ah!"" I was caught off guard and lurched forward, falling hard. My palms and knees hit the broken porcelain, sending sharp pain through me. Blood quickly stained the floor.

I gasped in pain, fury surging through me. I pushed myself up, seized Oliver's wrist, and raised my hand to discipline him. Alayna rushed forward with a scream, shielding the child behind her, her fingernails nearly grazing my face as she demanded, ""What do you think you're doing?""

I looked at her smug, arrogant face and slowly lowered my hand. With only five days left in the divorce cooling-off period, I needed to avoid causing any additional trouble.

When I backed down, a flicker of triumph crossed Alayna's eyes. She gently stroked Oliver's head and said softly, ""Don't be scared, sweetheart. You're the only young boy of the Durham family. No one would dare to bully you.""

After speaking, she glanced at my bleeding hand and snapped, ""What are you standing there for? Clean this up, then bring me a basin of water to wash my feet.""

I clenched my teeth against the pain, slowly wiping up the mess on the floor. Maria Donaldson, the housekeeper who had watched me grow up, couldn't bear it any longer. With tears in her eyes, she hurried over and whispered, ""Mrs. Durham, your hand is hurt. Please, let me handle this.""

Alayna overheard Maria call me ""Mrs. Durham."" Her face darkened instantly. She rushed over and slapped Maria hard several times. The sharp slaps echoed in the still living room.

Alayna screamed, ""Who gave you permission to call her Mrs. Durham? Can't you see who's in charge of this house now, who the future Mrs. Durham is? Are you blind?""

Chapter 6

As she spoke, she raised her hand again.

""Enough!"" I stood up abruptly and grabbed her wrist with my bloodstained hand, holding it tight. ""Alayna, Maria has worked on this base for 30 years. Even Franklin respects her. Who are you to lay a hand on her?""

I stepped closer, looking at her with a sharp gaze, my voice steady and firm. ""Push me too far, and I'll take you down with me. Who do you think Franklin will believe? An outsider like you, or people like us who have stood by him here for years?""

Alayna was momentarily stunned by my sudden outburst; she was left speechless. She wrenched her wrist free, shooting me a venomous glare before turning her fury on the other guards and housekeepers. ""All of you—come here! From this day forward, I am the sole lady of this household. Anyone who forgets their place or goes whispering to Frank behind my back. I have more than enough ways to ensure you're permanently removed from this base!""

The room was silent. She gave a cold snort, took Oliver's hand, and walked out quickly.

On the last day of the divorce cooling-off period, Franklin came back from his business trip. As the butler gave his report, he absentmindedly called Alayna ""Mrs. Durham."" Franklin stopped suddenly and looked sharply at Alayna. ""Mrs. Durham?"" he asked.

Before I could say anything, Alayna quickly moved into his arms. Her voice sounded both hurt and nervous. ""Frank, don't blame Ms. Westerdale. I must have upset her somehow. A few days ago, she was so angry that she told everyone to call me 'Mrs. Durham' from now on. She even said that she was tired of being Mrs. Durham.""

Franklin turned to look at me, forcing out the words. ""Grown tired?""

My gaze drifted to the sinking sunset outside. Thinking of the freedom awaiting me that night, I suddenly realized all arguments were pointless. I met his furious stare calmly, a faint smile touching my lips. ""Yes,"" I said softly. ""I've grown tired of it.""

Franklin pulled Alayna into his embrace, his voice icy. ""Fine. Very well. It seems three days of discipline taught you nothing—instead, you've come to believe the title of Mrs. Durham is your birthright. If you don't want it, someone else certainly will.""

That evening, the Durham family held a grand banquet at the military guesthouse. Franklin raised his glass, his voice carrying across the room. ""On this occasion, I declare that from this day forward, Alayna will be the future lady of the Durham family.""

Wearing the Durham family's heirloom emerald pendant, Alayna smiled as guests congratulated her. Meanwhile, I stood in the corner, feeling the sting of their mocking stares.

""I heard she was just a clerk at the compound. She clearly has no class. No wonder Commander Durham replaced her.""

""Someone with that background was never fit for a position of distinction anyway.""

Guests who once showered me with attention now ""accidentally"" jostled my tray repeatedly, splashing red wine across my flimsy dress. Before I could respond, someone shoved me hard from behind. I stumbled into the champagne tower, crystal glasses shattering around me as cold liquid drenched me completely.

As laughter spread through the crowd, Franklin glanced at me—soaked and disheveled—then turned and slipped a diamond ring onto Alayna's finger. Alayna's eyes filled with tears as she hugged him, but when she looked at me, her gaze was full of triumph.

At that moment, Howard's secretary quietly came to my side. I followed him out of the banquet hall discreetly. In the shadows near the side door, he handed me two things: a divorce certificate and a check. ""The car is waiting at the back entrance,"" he said. ""Sir Durham said that you must leave tonight.""

I wiped the wine from my face and walked out into the night without looking back.",1,1769229709.0,u_Different-Ad6118,0,1.0,False

**My questions for the performance marketers here:**

1. If you can generate 50 variations of a hook for the price of one coffee, does the ""soul"" of a human creator still matter for mid-funnel ads?
2. Are you seeing audience fatigue with virtual creators, or is the ""good enough"" threshold lower than we think for performance ads?

All I know is when I cut them off it was like I could catch my breath. Sometimes I miss the fun we had and I think of them but for the most part I like my life now, I’m making new friends slowly too.

I am a 27 year old guy from Michigan and traveling to Portland, OR for 8 days on my own. I haven’t gone on an entire vacation alone before so I’m a bit nervous (mostly good nerves). I plan on sightseeing, eating out, enjoying nightlife, etc.

I typically like my alone time but I’m worried that I’ll be on the other side of the country by myself for a while and will feel lonely. I like to think I’m somewhat social if need be but I’m not sure how to initiate a friendly conversation with someone I don’t know at a bar/coffee shop or something? 

Is it weird to have a few drinks alone at a bar? 

I’ve considered using a dating app to meet people but maybe that is misleading/weird? 

What are some good ways or things to do to not feel lonely? 

I’m sure I’ll be fine but I’m a bit of an overthinker lol. 

TL;DR - What are some useful tips for a new solo traveler hoping to make some friends/acquaintances? 

Or even just not feeling lonely.

I’m a 30 year old female and brought a lot of professionalism, experience, and positivity to the job. I was “let go” during my 90 days and he couldn’t even tell me why exactly. Only reason he said was “he need someone who can often work in a hectic environment..” This job was supposed to be remote with about 3 weeks training. This happened 2 days after I texted him if I could train from home that day as the previous weeks were training at his home and the day before he was having loud noisy construction / full kitchen reno done at his house and I couldn’t even here the phone calls coming in! It sounded like g\*n shots going off, for 8 hours, it was awful. I ended that day with a migraine from hell and full body panic.. but still I flipped my whole world upside down with my kids and daycare, our families schedule, and everything to accommodate this job. I spent $700 on an in-home office set up to be comfortable! I am livid. He “let me go” after meeting for a one month follow up and meeting at a coffee shop.

I am so frustrated and just want to scream. This extra income was supposed to be so nice for our family. I worked so hard at that job for a month where I got every task done, was ahead of schedule, was polite and did everything with a smile on my face.

1qldajs,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingfeedback/comments/1qldajs/a_short_story_i_wrote_this_is_a_synthesis_of_my/,"a short story I wrote! This is a synthesis of my readings of The Immoralist (Gide), The Wings (Sang), and a bit of Kitchen (Yoshimoto) into my own voice. Let me know if you see any influences ! Overall, I would love feedback on my prose <3","**A Poppy in the Mail**

My trip to Timpston halted. A sudden stop as the train conductor pushed on the brakes. I felt the jolt in my bones with an immediacy strange to me. My fountain pen, which ran across my paper in nostalgic zeal, danced to the side. A thin, black line ran over the margin. 

I was more agitated by the imperfection on my paper than by the mysterious mishap. This was to be a perfect letter for an equally perfect woman, a mother who awaited me in the fire-warmed, amber kitchen— stirring a stew or brewing coffee. My trip to the desert had been longer than expected. The revelations and comic epiphanies are even more rejuvenating. I had so much to tell her, to pen it all down in flawless writing and prose. Alas, it was imperfect. I need to start over again. 

Other passengers in the train were caught off guard. An old woman, her eyes as if stolen from the authoritative statue of Athena, had crumbled in sudden horror. She clutched the string of pearls in defence against some unseeable threat; pearls which were tight around her neck, choking her. A man, crows' feet whispering near the eyes, placed a steadying hand on the woman’s purple shoulder. It was a reddish-purple cloth. Or was it reddish-brown? It was burgundy. Was that her son?

I had remained seated where I was, and remained gawking at them as if seeing an old woman and a moustached man for the first time. They must feel me staring. A grating sensation on their already-attentive nerves. A silent, simmering feeling of disgust rose within me. What business did I have being so invasive? I was the only one unbothered by the stop. 

My stack of papers (which were expertly bound by a thin layer of glue) sat beside me. I peeled off a page, sand-brown, like the deserts, and placed it on the notebook on my lap. My pen hovered on the surface, and my eyes lingered on my earlier draft. My fingers itched with words unwritten, impatient to transcribe thoughts impossible to articulate. I relied on my ruined draft. Copy it to the new sheet. Make no mistakes. 

I began writing. Each stroke of the pen was meticulous, a rehearsed performance. How many times had I messed up? The tumult of the passengers slowly thinned, as if my mind had numbed me from it to nurture my thoughts. 

My trip to the deserts had been— 

The lifeblood of my pen had run out. It wrote dithered lines, or none. 

It was a series of unfortunate events, what this was. What had the forces of nature, of God, if he existed, have against me? Was this punishment for not writing a letter sooner? A warning?

I flicked my dead pen to the side, watching it emotionlessly fall onto the pile of sandy paper. Inspiration was lost to me. After spending months on the scorching yellow dunes and having my fun with the sun-tanned locals, I had wholly believed myself rebranded. A man filled to the brim with life, health, and freedom. The man who aimlessly leeched onto the past was a forgotten ghost, the man who copied dead letters and words was a thing tethered to the past (an ugly thing). I had made myself new, now watch me plummet. 

Only in my utter misery and disappointment at myself did I look at the scenery from my carriage window. How did I never notice this? Before me was an endless field of poppies. Bright red, like the setting desert sun. I leaned in, peeking outside toward the entrance of the train. I saw the old lady, hand still on her neck, standing, facing the horizon. Her son was talking with the conductor, frustrated. I could tell since his brows furrowed viciously. 

I didn’t get out of my seat, yet my whole body faced the poppy field. My palm pressed against the glass, the cold surface only a barrier between me and the living dream ahead. I scanned the never-ending rows of flowers, as if each were placed in exact places which were apart an exact distance, down to the dot. I was reminded of my previous job as an industrial labourer fitting caps on toothpaste tubes, which were lined the same way as these humble flowers. 

My eyes, sharp as ever now, looked at this symmetrical field for imperfection. Not a single flower taller than the other, not a single one discoloured. Harmonious. All the same. Identical. Perfect. 

On the far edge, blending into the curve of the Earth, was a blob, a blur of something. Someone? A boy, maybe. My eyes zeroed in on the speck of brown until I convinced myself of what I saw. A young boy, sun-kissed, a teenager, by the looks of it. Or was he younger? Blame it on the limits of the human for my lack of vision. We can only see so much. 

The colour of his skin rekindled the images of my stay in the deserts. The company that I enjoyed. The local children, whom I adored for their youthful health, how they had been so full of life that it made me jealous. Their golden and brown colours, their mischievousness, and their big black eyes made them hard to forget. My wife (may she rest in peace) was fond of them for their childish curiosity. One of the boys had stolen her scissors! Ah, what a useless pair it was. It was the memories that I held onto. 

The figure stayed unmoving for a while before it retreated. The blurry speck of a boy soon turned to a dot. Despite myself, I had looked so far away in search of him that my forehead bumped into the glass. What a fleeting sight. 

I eased into my chair when the dot of the boy vanished into the red field. My eyes found themselves, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, back to the notebook on my lap. It was not just a writing pad, but it contained photographs of my stay in deserts, which I intended to show my mother. I didn’t have the will to write. 

I had spent quite a few minutes sitting aimlessly, thinking, or doing nothing at all. The noise of hard soles tapping became an ambience in which I almost fell asleep, before I felt a contact on my shoulder. 

It was a slight, unknowing shove. Nothing more. When I opened my eyes, I saw a poppy’s petal on my notebook. I glanced back to see the polished back of the old woman walking past me. She walked as if authority embodied was her, but amidst the impeccable posture and costume, I saw a bright red thing tucked behind her ear. A three-flowered poppy. Strange. 

I sighed, turning my attention back to my lap. The petal lay there instead of a letter. Quaint, red, soft. I felt the velvet between my fingers and thought of the setting desert sun. ",1,1769229044.0,writingfeedback,0,1.0,False

This started a week ago on Thursday. I was in the library running on 5.5 hours of sleep and coffee when my left hand started twitching. It felt stiffer than my right, and I panicked—convinced it was ALS. Stupidly, I tried lifting 20lbs with just my index finger and thumb. My left hand fatigued faster than my right, which scared me more.

By Friday, I'd caught some kind of cold at work (I don't normally nap, but I crashed for 1-2 hours when I got home). That night I stayed on my laptop until 4:30am, then couldn't fall asleep until 6am. It was hot, my good fan had been replaced with a crappy one—but instead of blaming that, my brain jumped to sCJD or sporadic fatal insomnia (SFI). That's been my new fear ever since, no longer ALS.

Since then, I've been obsessively self-testing every single day: tandem walking, finger-to-nose, heel-to-shin, rapid alternating hand movements, cognitive tests on Memtrax. I pass everything. Reaction time averaging 170-180ms, memory tests at 100% accuracy. But I can't stop.

My sleep has been all over the place—anywhere from 4.5 to 7 hours. Some nights I fall asleep in 10-20 minutes, other nights it takes an hour (usually when I'm spiraling). Falling asleep since after Saturday and Sunday isn't typically the issue; staying asleep is. I keep waking up mid-dream, and today with a buzzing/static sensation in my body (I think that's just REM atonia?).

I've also had these random pins and needles since Monday or Tuesday—appearing randomly in my hands, feet, legs, calves, either side. Feels like one or two hot needles. No idea what that's about.

The cold? Viral infection? Or something is still lingering too. Yellow phlegm, clogged nose, having to clear my throat before speaking. My sleep heart rate has been slightly elevated, which I'm wondering might just be my body fighting an infection or worse.

Where I'm at now (Friday):

Last night was my one of worst sleep yet besides the one on Saturday—only 4 hours 40 minutes. I took 200mg magnesium glycinate at 11:45pm, went to bed at 12:20, fell asleep by 12:29. But I woke up at 2:03am mid-dream with this buzzing sensation on my body? I think it’s Rem Atonia?Weirdly, my hand was in my underwear? Nothing in the dream was related to that—wondering if that's parasomnia or just normal sleep movement.

I managed to fall back asleep after 39 minutes, slept another 3 hours, then woke at 5:49 with stomach pain and had to use the bathroom. Couldn't fall back asleep after that. Called off work because I felt like garbage.

I would say though, Thursday was probably my most anxious and feeling hopeless day—I was self-testing constantly until my legs were tired from tandem walking. Even right before bed, I was doing heel-to-shin tests. Everything still checks out fine, but the anxiety is eating me alive.

I'm thinking about adding melatonin (haven't taken it in about a year) alongside the magnesium. Maybe L-theanine too. I have no work tomorrow, so it seems like a good time to experiment.

I can't keep living like this. I have school, work, responsibilities.

What's happening to me? What can I do?

I have been going there for a few days because I was desperate for a place to work. I came in around 11.30 am and was working quietly when at about 1.30pm, a server asked me to move to an uncomfortable corner. I was weirded out because I was the only one who was asked to do so, when there were other people who stayed there longer than I was. Well they were foreigners so that could be the main reason I was singled out.

I was about to consider moving when a lady from the management (or the gf of the owner or smth) came to me and again told me to move to this really out of the way,almost broken down chair. I tried to explain my situation but she didn’t listen and didn’t care. She kept on saying that she “let” me stay the whole day yesterday, like I wasn’t paying for the food and drinks the whole time. Mind you this isn’t a cheap place. It’s a place where you pay a lot to get bland food.

So it appeared she was mad at me for staying there the whole day yesterday and taking that anger out on me now?

Anyway she asked me “are you paying to stay for the whole day?”. She talked like I wasn’t a paying customer when I was ordering drinks and food the whole day and there was no customer flow that day.

I told her that this was unprofessional and she called me unprofessional back

I was shocked and disgusted at this point. I was singled out and attacked.

She left mid-convo without any apology. My work was disrupted and I felt really low.

Another server came again and asked me to move and agreed that she doesn’t know how to speak.

I paid and left.

Again the problem isn’t them asking me to move, it’s the WAY they did it, like they couldn’t wait to get rid of me. If they explained their situation and asked me to move politely, nothing would have happened.

When i read their reviews I could see that I wasn’t the only person she was disrespectful to. It appears she hasn’t changed her behavior.

It ruined my whole day and I have never been treated so poorly by a restaurant.

It’s disheartening that locals are treated unfairly, while foreigners are welcomed for their money.

""I’m not sure if you expected more money from me to buy frames (\*a christmas gift she planned to order me after we left). But if you did I’m using that money to get a cleaning girl to clean the mess you left for me both in my condo and in my car. Not trying to be confrontational just telling it like it is. Hope you’re enjoying your trip.""

However, we did not leave a mess. We took out the garbage, emptied the dishwasher, cleaned the fridge and everything was tidied up. We did not do the laundry which included bedding and towels. Her car did have sand in it since we went to the beach multiple days (with her too). She originally said I had to take the car somewhere to get cleaned but one of the last days said she would deal with it.

On top of that, my mother-in-law also visited (via flight). She got in at 10 pm christmas eve after working all day and was leaving the day after christmas. The plan was that we would take my mom's car to the car rental facility the morning after christmas as we were driving to the next part of our trip and since my mom would be staying at her boyfriend's house down the street, she would meet us there to pick up her car. But she ""forgot"" the plan and ultimately when my mother-in-law offered to drive us instead, my mom said ok- even though my MIL was visiting for only 1.5 days and had planned to go to the beach before her evening flight.

Anyway, I have been distant from my mom since because I'm sick of ​the way she acts frankly. But when she asked me why i haven't been answering her texts I told her I was taking space because of the above experiences. She blamed me ​for giving her bursitis in her arm because she had to do ""8 loads of laundry for the bed alone"", had to clean the sand out of her car as well as a coffee stain on her leather seat apparently, and I assume she had to vacuum. I guess she did not get a cleaning lady like she said. I just wanted to get people's feedback about this. Is it normal to expect your daughter to do the laundry, vacuum, vacuum the car while visiting with a 1 year old? Not to mention, my husband and I were both working while down there, my husband made all of our meals for us which she also ate, and he fixed a few miscellaneous things in her condo for her. My mom's retired. We were leaving the morning after Christmas to drive to the next spot we were visiting which was 5 hours away- with our 1 year old. I don't know how we would have even been able to do any more cleaning before we left.

I guess I should bring her to the pet shop tomorrow because they have a 30 day guarantee. I know she was bred to be snake food, but I think I’ve given them excellent care and enrichment.

Purely wretched, filled with diabolical malaise. Shaking like the West Coast and sweating like the Amazon. Thick, putrid drops of beaded ammonia slid down my wrinkled forehead and practically served as nature’s bitters; a splash or two in the gin won’t hurt anyone. The first one settled my fingers but didn’t do much as far as the brain was concerned. If anything, it made me more irritable. A taste of what I wanted turned my little demons feral. What a disgrace. And it’s only noon or so.

I’m lurking in the kitchen in front of my father. He’s left a knife on the tipping point of the sink in case another peanut sandwich entices him. I’m shivering from my abstinence but I’m on my way. My hands are hot and the fridge cools them while I wait for him to pass. He surely heard me kick the freezer shut. That’s why he hasn’t said anything. Yellow mustard stares me down. Do I take a squirt to cover up the smell? Will he notice if I walk by stinking like a mouthful of condiments? A hotdog? His nose isn’t sharp, never has been. I would have been grounded more often as a teenager. Where’s the leftovers? Maybe my breath won’t make its way to the coffee pot.

Pass the milk, he says, and shut the door if you’re not going to eat anything.

I’m just looking for a snack, I reply, almond or regular?

Almond’s your moms.

Alright, here you go. My hand extends as far as the sink and I duck back into the lower centigrade again. I can tell he’s looking at me through the insulation. Superman vision, MRI accuracy.

You alright? He shuffles towards me.

Yeah, just hungry.

We have crackers, I think, mom’s out shopping, she’ll be back in an hour. His hand is on my back, and it’s going in circles. A bit handsy for the morning.

I got it, thanks. I move deeper into the fridge and grab a yoghurt tub. Shrug my shoulder. Vanilla bean. Dad’s lurking still but against the island now. His flip flops dragging. Pass a spoon? I ask.

Sure. The drawer slips open and the mustard glares at me again next to the Caesar sauce. My right hand grazes the bottle but there’s not enough time.

You sure you’re alright? He hands the spoon over. Our eyes do not meet.

Fine, yeah. The tub is full of spaghetti. Last week Tuesday.

Might not want to eat that, dad suggests.

I dip my nose in to smell it, turn around. Is it bad?

Toss it. Want a sandwich? His back is towards me. He’s reaching for a loaf on top of the microwave. His ankles are extended and his calves are flexed below his bathrobe. The knife tips into the sink and clatters on the drain. I jump. He laughs. What are you so shaky for? That spoon’s practically bent, you’re jittering so much.

It scared me, that’s all.

You’ve been shaking and staring at the fridge since I came down here. Have sandwich, you’re probably hungry.

Him, the mustard, and the stairs are gawking at me individually. Three options in front of me, but why are those the fucking options? Run, mask, or lean in. What’s he gonna say? What’s the harm in sitting with the man? My dad? He’s right, the spaghetti is rattling at a microwave level of vibration in my hand. And it’s not appealing; in fact, it stinks. I shut the door and toss the tub in the trash and sit at the island on the furthest barstool.

Coffee?

I nod.

Sandwich? The loaf is already open and there’s two plates out.

I nod again, tap my fingers on the quartz.

Grape or raspberry? He’s only got the grape out.

Raspberry.

He stops his knife mid spread, holding peanut butter on the bread like a wave. Grape alright?

Sorry this is long. For some background my husband died 6 months ago and we have 2 children 3 and 18 months. My husband was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in 2019. Prior to this I had a good relationship with his parents but there's always been a lot of dismissing of inappropriate behaviours between all members of the family. When my husband was diagnosed we lived with my in laws for 6 months while we got our head around things. I did not want to do this and decision were made without consulting me. I accepted the situation but was extremely depressed and even a bit suicidal at certain points but my husband at the time felt his family would be a good support. They weren't. I was his only caregiver throughout the duration of his treatment, stuck in a house i had no space or privacy. I also supported his mental health as they destroyed it along the way (eg making fun of him for being scared of dying etc) once we moved out we had an ok relationship with them but id be lying if I said I didnt carry resentment towards them and his siblings for a range of issues but was always polite and hoped things would change. All of which were swept under the rug. 5 years passed, treatment was going well and we had our 2 children. When I was pregnant with my youngest my in laws agreed to look after our first (My mil would have probably lost it if I asked anyone else.) while I was in hospital. I spent most of my days off work at their house helping him get used to them and their house (never left him there, i was there still caring for him) a few months later they posted in the family chat dates of their travel plans for the year. One trip was 2 weeks right over my due date. We raised this with them and things got heated. They told us we are all a burden and we take advantage of them which was very surprising to me because I had a traumatic childhood that shows up by me relying very little on other people. They also told us they dont care about grandchildren and it wouldnt matter to them if they didnt see them (they begged everyone in the family for grandchildren for years).

We attempted to repair things with them multiple times and everytime they doubled down so we went lower and lower contact with them for 2 years up until my husband's death. Anytime we would see them they would tell us to get over it and move on. We would say not until things are acknowledged and repaired instead of rug sweeping. My husband suddenly went downhill and on going to hospital found out the cancer was back and everywhere. It was very unexpected. He begged his parents to make things right. His dad finally apologised. The family came together for his final 2 weeks of life. I had brought him home with palliative care to die at home. I was still the sole person caring for him in everyway as well as our 2 children while completely heartbroken about the situation. I asked them to sit with him one morning to take my daughter to the doctor and as soon as I was gone they immediate said they were victims and I ruined their family. On his death bed my husband yelled at them and told them to get out. Still when he passed I called them so they could sit with him etc and split his ashes with his parents and siblings. They left me to do everything for his memorial and on the day despite having rsvped his mum didnt attend. No text no call, before or after. I messaged her a week later asking for an explanation. She blocked me.  Now 6 months have passed and she has reached out saying we should do coffee and she is free for baby sitting and helping with cooking because she promised her son she would be there for us so i should believe her word. Even if she was sorry which shes never said she is, I just dont want her around and I dont want this family near our children. My husband told me on his death bed to trust my instinct when it came to them and not to feel bad about cutting and running.
People keep asking if ive been in contact and whether Ill forgive them and let them back in as if thats something I should be aiming for. That it would be good for the kids to have them. 
We have friends and other family that have been absolute top tier support. In my mind I think this family is all so crazy and toxic, but AITAH? Should I be giving them another chance? Is my trauma history clouding this?

1qld3w7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qld3w7,PSA. Bad experience at this brunch place in Galle Fort,"I’ve been going to this café for a few days because I needed a place to work. I came in around 11:30 a.m. and was working quietly when, at about 1:30 p.m., a server asked me to move to a corner seat. I found it a bit odd because I was the only one asked to move, even though others had stayed longer than I had.

Shortly after, a woman who appeared to be part of management came over and again asked me to move to a seat that was quite uncomfortable. I tried to explain my situation, but she didn’t seem to consider it. She also mentioned that she had “let” me stay the whole day yesterday, which made it feel like I wasn’t being recognized as a paying customer, despite having ordered and paid for food and drinks.

She also said this is a brunch place and asked if I was “paying to stay for the whole day.” When I mentioned that I felt this interaction was unprofessional, she called me unprofessional in return. She then left without any apology.

Another server later agreed that the situation could have been handled better.

The problem wasn’t being asked to move — it was the way it was communicated. If it had been explained politely, I would have understood. Unfortunately, my work was disrupted, and the experience left me feeling unwelcome.

It was disappointing, especially because it felt like local customers might be treated differently from others.",16,1769228508.0,srilanka,6,0.79,False
