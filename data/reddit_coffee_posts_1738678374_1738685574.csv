Since then I have been on what I call a ""BRAT plus"" diet of whole wheat toast, white rice, peanut butter with crackers, mild guacamole, mint and ginger tea, oat milk cheese and coconut milk yoghurt, beans, peas, brocolli, edamame, and nuts for 2 months. I use olive oil as my only condiment. I have tested negative for h pylori. I have only had a few stomach aches since then caused by soy yoghurt, cranberry juice, and black tea. I finally had my endoscopy today and the doctor said I could start introducing new foods. The results showed ""diffuse erythema of the mucosa was noted in the antrum and stomach body."" I have not been prescribed any medication. I am vegan and not sure what new foods to introduce. Now that I am off caffeine I will not go back to coffee.

It‚Äôs kind of ‚Äúexpected‚Äù that they will come over Friday and stay until Sunday unless I or they have an obligation to attend to, then the weekend will be cut short. We will be moving in together in probably 6 months time.

The issue I‚Äôm seeing a lot recently is that I feel like I value ‚Äúalone time‚Äù much more than they do. For example, I like to play video games alone or read on my phone with my focus on my phone, or study something on my laptop, etc. Many of my hobbies I like doing alone as they‚Äôre technology related, but the only real free time I have to do these things is on the weekends because I work during the week, then usually workout after work, cook etc and by then it‚Äôs super late. 

When my SO comes over for the weekend, they basically always want to spend every waking second doing the exact same thing as me - which I understand because we only see each other on weekends. But often times because it‚Äôs winter, we‚Äôll sit on the couch together watching some movie or show when in reality I‚Äôd rather be trying to do a hobby of mine alone, after a while doing pointless things together just to do them together gets kind of boring and I‚Äôd much rather spend my time doing productive stuff, but my SO takes offense when she comes over and I decide to focus my attention on my laptop or something, which I understand but otherwise how do I every do anything I want to do?

How do you balance co-existing at times in the relationship when we don‚Äôt live together yet? My worry is if this is how I feel now, when I live with my SO, I‚Äôll lose myself in the relationship because always be spent doing everything with them when not all of our interests are the same. 

I want my SO to come over on the weekends and kind of just live life normally, doing some things together and some things independently as if they lived at their house on the weekends normally. But instead I feel like I wake up, we sit on the couch and drink a coffee together, cook breakfast and eat together, go to the gym together, come back and watch some movie or show together or play a game together, make dinner together, do some other activity together and then go to bed. It‚Äôs like this all the time, is this normal?

Anytime I lay on the couch facing away just reading on my phone, I get asked if what I‚Äôm doing is a secret, etc. I‚Äôm starting to feel smothered and controlled as if I always have to report to someone and need help not feeling so attached at the hip by my SO. Am I wrong with how I feel, is this how a long term relationship is supposed to be? I feel like it would be wrong for me to go play video games for a few hours alone because they‚Äôre over, but how else do I maintain a sense of self when the only true free time I have for hobbies is on the weekends.

1ihl52p,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuntaCanaAllInclusive/comments/1ihl52p/secrets_tides_full_review/,Secrets Tides - Full Review,"Resort

We arrived during a very large corporate gathering but the resort didn‚Äôt feel crowded at all. In retrospect, the resort clearly planned for the increased number of people and we had great/timely service while we were there concurrently. I say that because the shift in staffing was noticeable following the end of the corporate event. On multiple occasions we had to either wait for pool towels because the kiosk was not stocked, or I just had to go behind the kiosk and grab towels after waiting a considerable amount of time because the kiosk was unstaffed. Our reservation was for 5 nights and while we didn‚Äôt request room cleaning/linen changes every day, on more than one occasion the request for room service sat unanswered until the next day. 

Room

Preferred Club Swim-Out King - After our ocean front swim out in Cancun last year (Secrets Riviera Maya) I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever NOT splurge for a swim-out room. The room itself looked very similar to our Cancun swim-out with the added features of bluetooth speakers built in to the ceiling, a nice touch for sure. Our mini fridge was restocked daily and the nightly turn down service ensured we had plenty of bottled water on our nightstands and the bathroom counter, presumably for brushing your teeth. Also to note, I used the bottled water to brush my teeth and rinse my tooth brush while my wife used the tap water; neither of us had any issues. The double rain shower was also a nice touch with neither of us having any issues with a lack of hot water. I think we both preferred Secrets Tides swim-out design over the design at Secrets Riviera Maya. From what I saw (at least in the preferred section) is that the rooms were staggered such that only two rooms and swim-outs were grouped together; meaning the swim-out would only be shared with one other room. In our case, we lucked out as the couple in the room next to us checked out the day we arrived and we had the entire area to ourselves the duration of our stay.

Food

Meraki (Mediterranean/Asian Fusion) - We sat for hours. Literal hours. The food was good, but the experience was ruined by having waited over an hour for our food to come out. Which for some reason was appetizer and entree at the same time. Noting that this was after the large corporate gather had departed.

Tierra (South American Fusion) - I think had we ordered different menu items we would have enjoyed this better. Both my wife‚Äôs fish and my red snapper were on the dry side, but the flavor was incredible. Quick service and a note that our visit to this restaurant occurred when the corporate gather was still happening, so perhaps staffing was at a higher level. I think my wife would agree that this was our favorite restaurant.

Oceana (Preferred Club - Seafood) - We tried this for both breakfast one day and lunch another. Breakfast was pretty standard and nothing out of the ordinary. Slightly more variety than the buffet breakfast but considering the amount of time we waited for service/food we‚Äôd choose the buffet if time is of the essence. Lunch was a much better experience. My wife and I both got the Dominican special and loved it. Much quicker service.

Portofino (Italian) - The ‚Äúfine dining‚Äù restaurant. Quick service and solid food options. My wife made her own pasta and seemed to enjoy it, thought she did mention it was a little salty. I had the Ossobucco and also enjoyed it. Moist, flavorful, and a good size portion. 

Seaside Grill (Grilled Meat/Seafood) - I‚Äôm a sucker for picanha and devoured my entree with no shame, tasted very similar to Texas de Brazil‚Äôs picanha cut. My wife‚Äôs t-bone was flavorful, moist, and cooked as requested. Looking back at our not so great experience with some of the other restaurants, I‚Äôd choose this over Meraki and Oceana (Seaside is also open for lunch).

Market Caf√© (Buffet) - Quite impressed by the buffet, both by quality and quantity of available items. I know most people say to stay away from the buffet but we found the experience the same, in not better than the restaurants. The breakfast choices were limited, but our only other option was Oceana which you just read about. Lunch and Dinner is where this buffet shines. We ate two lunches and a dinner there and could not have been happier. Picanha was available the first lunch, prime rib the next. Never crowded and we appreciated the ability to eat as quickly or slowly as we wanted after our experiences at Meraki and Oceana.

Coco Caf√© - 24 hour coffee shop that also has quick bites; sandwiches, wraps, desserts, etc. We went pretty much every day, typically in the afternoon/evening and there wasn‚Äôt ever a long wait or line. Coffee drinks come out quick and unlike last year I didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúthe itis‚Äù after having an iced coffee.

Preferred Club Lounges - Based on our experience at Secrets in Cancun, we found this lounge incredibly lacking. The same or fewer selections available at Coco Caf√©. Very minimal stock and typically limited to small bite size dessert items.

**Also want to note that the menus displayed within the Hyatt Inclusive App/Sunbox.app website differed (sometimes dramatically) from the actual menus we were handed when dining.

In Room Dining - We did in-room breakfast on the day of our departure and it was about as expected. Eggs, hash browns, meat. I will note that this was delivered at the requested time to the minute. We also ordered in-room lunch one day and thoroughly enjoyed it. Burger, buffalo wings, fries. No complaints at all.

Beach/Activites

We took advantage of a handful of resort activities this visit. Hat painting, doll painting, painting on the beach, jewelry making. We found the events fun and gave us an opportunity to meet and chat with other guests. The event‚Äôs weren‚Äôt overcrowded and we genuinely enjoyed them. 

Since we had our own swim-out we didn‚Äôt spend a whole lot of time on the beach, but we did walk the beach in the morning and evening a number of times. When we did venture to the preferred beach, we had no issue finding chairs, beds, etc.",1,1738685249.0,PuntaCanaAllInclusive,0,1.0,False

1ihl2b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3_productions/comments/1ihl2b9/fallen_fan_dissertation/,Fallen Fan Dissertation,"Embarrassingly this ‚Äúdrama‚Äù has been occupying my mind quite a bit for the past while so I‚Äôm going to just get my thoughts out here.

I think a lot of the people left must be a hangover from the Frenemies era who have no knowledge of Israel/Palestine. I‚Äôm a Masters student and I take a journalism class and his video and sources would not pass an assignment. Ethan has no idea how to cite reliable sources. He slapped a bunch of clips together of Hasan talking to chatters with screenshots of headlines and spooky music to pull at emotion. As a drama video this may seem compelling but as a journalistic piece this is trash. The ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù montage? What does that prove? Comparing Anne Frank to Rashed Al-Haddad is such a nothing point. Like I can compare a teenage Palestinian girl to an IDF soldier, does that mean anything? No. 

Also to add context, I'm Irish and Irish people unequivocally support Palestine because of our history with colonialism. Israelis in response have been calling Irish people antisemitic and Paddystinians for supporting Palestine. People in Ireland who fought against the British colonisers over generations (not just in modern times like the IRA but other small groups over 100s of years) were considered ""terrorists"". They were just people fighting with whatever tactics they could for their freedom. There was a group called ‚ÄúWhiteboys‚Äù (I know) who operated where I‚Äôm from in Ireland, who would wear white sheets and tear down fences put up on common grazing land by English landlords. As punishment Whiteboys could be put in prison, hanged publicly or sent to Australia. A local priest where I‚Äôm from was publicly hanged, drawn and quartered in a sham murder trial for supporting the agrarian class struggle of the whiteboys. This was in the 1700s but I mention this because my background makes me pause when I see the word terrorist. When Ethan said ‚Äúthe terrorist is in the eye of the beholder‚Äù he is correct, ironically. 

On the topic of the Houthi music video. The west eats up american military propaganda all the time. American military propaganda wins Oscars and stars heart throbs like Bradley Cooper and Josh Hartnett. So Hasan watched a music video. Would people think it‚Äôs crazy to watch a Black Hawk Down trailer? People don't think of American propaganda as even being political because it's the default. Like is Call of Duty ""political""? People don't think of it that way but when a Palestinian tries to make a game about their experiences it‚Äôs deemed ""too political"", see what happened with games like Dreams on a Pillow, Fursan al-Aqsa and Lilya. They had to be crowd funded or were deplatformed for being ""too political"". Young Irish people still sing Irish rebel songs and chant Ooh Ah Up the Ra does that mean Irish people want to kill English people? No. It‚Äôs a symbol of resistance of the colonial English government.

When Ethan referred to Ramallah as ""a terrorist city"" in that clip where they talk about Hila joining the raid, you don't think this points to his biases and how he sees Palestinian people as less human? Ramallah has a KFC, a Pizza Hut, a fancy cinema, coffee shops, a taco restaurant, a fancy hotel. Imagine an English person moved to Northern Ireland and called Derry a terrorist city??? I like to put this in context where both groups are white people because we all know these people don‚Äôt see brown people as humans and hear the word terrorist and think ‚Äúbrown people‚Äù. 

Contrary to what these people seem to think, this didn‚Äôt start with October 7th by a long shot. One example being the Sabra and Shatila massacre in 1982. A refugee camp filled with Palestinians was massacred by the Lebanese Phalanges with help from the IDF. Pregnant women had babies ripped from their bodies. Women were raped. The Phalanges were funded by Israel and assisted by the IDF. I believe Frogan's dad lived through this very massacre as mentioned on the Ayyrabs podcast episode titled, ""We Got Banned on Twitch"" so unsurprising she feels how she does.

Sorry this is long but I was a long time H3 fan and I'm sad to see what Ethan has become and I have a lot of feeling about it lol. I used to cringe when he mentioned Palestine in the past but his takes were ambiguous enough I could hand wave it and hope he was on the right side of things but his ignorance is more than clear now. 

As an ex H3 fan I find it really funny to see Ethan using ""the CEO of twitch is Hasans best friend"" argument when Ethan himself was accused of the same with Susan Wojcicki and he always pointed out how dumb it was. Twitch's biggest streamer is Asmomgold who said Palestinians are s*bhuman so where is this magical influence leftists have over Twitch? Of course this is not the only case of Ethan being massively hypocritcal but I couldn't possibly point them all out. Philly D ham sandwich incident, many such cases.

Hasan is obsessive knowledge on this topic  and if they debated I think it might break Ethan. He‚Äôs highly stubborn and I‚Äôm sure in a past stream where he spoke about his family he mentioned that his family have a hard time saying when they‚Äôre wrong and how he hated that. He‚Äôs exactly the same. He‚Äôs turning into everything he hates about his dad. This is just Ethans latest hyperfocus, it‚Äôs just a flavour of the week. He didn't know Netanyahu's first name is Benjamin or who yoav gallant was like please, as Hasan said, he‚Äôs not a serious person. Hasan would annihilate him. He's just not equipped and the video was actually poorer than I expected. He'll say he's accepted the debate but Hasan must watch the video, Hasan won't cave and so his fans can say that Hasan is the one dodging the ""debate"". ",4,1738685060.0,h3h3_productions,0,1.0,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Looking for Advices and Coffee Chat Opportunity (US- EST),"I was laid off from a transaction service team (FDD) of a national accounting firm in Dec 2023 and joined my current company, a 100-people biopharma company (publicly listed) as a sr. FA. My responsibilities are mainly involved with financial reporting - accruals at month and quarter ends/FLUX/variance analysis/MD&A, OPEX budgeting/forecast, Ad hoc tasks (pulling out data from accounting systems and do certain analysis, mainly about OPEX, draft PPT for CFO‚Äôs presentation etc.), and updating company cash-flow and balance sheet/IS model for future years. Originally I wanted to stay for at least a solid 2 to 3 years,  but the cash-flow of the company starts to concern me a little bit. I‚Äôm also a Canadian citizen working under TN status, so job security means a lot to me. I would not change my job until it‚Äôs necessary. 

The issues I noticed in my daily work after spent a year with the company: 
1. I feel I‚Äôm doing quite a lot accounting work - I‚Äôm collecting accrual information from the cost center owners at vendor level and prepare the accrual entries, which I strongly feel this is AP work‚Ä¶I used to be senior auditors or assistant controller, but never thought I would do accruals in this way‚Ä¶
2. System either out of date or the FP&A module not set up, so everything is still finished in excel, which requires significant time spending on pulling the data from accounting system, modifying it in the way we want, then the real analysis work begins‚Ä¶ this feels like early 2010 not 2020s. I hope I‚Äôm over analyzing. 
3. The previous assistant controller who was responsible for these responsibilities was promoted as a director who‚Äôs purely in charge of all sales related fp&a responsibilities, including sales forecasting and budgeting, business partnership with direct sales and marketing. I asked about learning some sales related modelling or analysis work, but the answer is no. They want me to focus what I‚Äôm doing now.


With the cash flow issue mentioned earlier I started casually looking, and my resume helped me landed in several interviews, but I‚Äôm not confident enough because I‚Äôm lack of real life modelling experience and working knowledge of FP&A systems. I appreciate my company gave me the opportunity stepped into FP&A world, but I can‚Äôt see myself there in long run.  I‚Äôm self learning some data analysis courses now. What else can I do to enhance my skill sets as a real FP&A analyst?

Short version: CPA with transaction service in a FP&A Sr. Analyst role that is more like controller with accounting heavy responsibility looking to know more about how real FP&A role works in a more developed system, and how to enhance my skill sets (tips, direction etc.)",1,1738684763.0,FPandA,0,1.0,False

After a 2024 where I was spending more than I made, I decided to do a Mindful and Low Spend 2025. Here are some things I accomplished along the way, and my plans for the rest of the year that might be helpful to some of you! If you have any other tips, please share them as well!



**BUDGET TRACKING:**

This one is the biggest help so far. Write down every single thing you spend money on. It takes only 10 minutes to do this each week. I never realized how quickly extra, non-essential spend adds up. Even after being mindful for the entire month of January, I still spent over $100 on ""extras"". If I wasn't tracking, that number could easily have been $500.

**SUBSCRIPTIONS:**

I canceled every single subscription I have, except my gym membership. I rarely watch enough tv to justify 3 streaming services. And why was I paying for Microsoft 365 each year when I could easily just use Google Docs? Why was I paying for Book of The Month when I could easily borrow the books from Libby?

Chances are, you are paying for subscriptions you hardly use. Take a look and cancel the ones that aren't worth it. If you have 3 streaming services, cancel 2 and only use one at a time. Use that one until you're sick of it, and then cancel it to start another one. 

**GROCERIES:** 

Try turning one week out of every month into a no-groceries week. Turns out I have PLENTY of food in the freezer and pantry to cover me for that entire week. I will restock those staples quarterly at Costco. I bet you have plenty in your pantries that you forgot about! Take stock of what you have and use ChatGPT to help you turn it into meals for the week. 

**NO IMPROMPTU TAKE-OUT OR COFFEE:**

Fast food and take-out isn't cheap anymore. Neither is coffee. That stuff adds up quickly, so if you just ""stop by"" Chipotle on your way home from work 3x/week, or get specialty coffee whenever the weather is cold (aka: always, in New England in January), you're going to be spending way more money than you realize. 

I am giving myself one specialty coffee per month, and one take out meal per month. I have to be mindful and make sure I use them when they'll be the most appreciated. 

**EATING OUT:**

Give yourself an allowance and stick to it. The general rule of thumb that I'm following is that i can eat out once per month during cold months, and twice per month when I'm not paying for heat. Limit 2 alcoholic beverages. 

**ALCOHOL:**

This can work one of two ways, depending on where you typically spend your money. My personal weakness is drinking at home. I would often buy craft beer just to drink by myself while reading or journaling. It was costing so much money. So now, I am not going to keep ANY alcohol in the house, and will only drink 1-2x/month when going out to eat with friends.

If drinking out at bars/restaurants is what is draining your budget, then do the opposite of what I do. Instead of going out for drinks, have a night in with friends, play games, watch movies, etc. Much cheaper than constantly buying drinks from a restaurant/bar. 

**USE WHAT YOU HAVE:**

ONLY buy necessities when you run out of the ones you already have. For me, this means skin care, shampoo, and tea (Lots and lots and lots of tea). This will prevent you from having a million half-full bottles of products that you never end up using. 

The same kind of goes for the groceries tip above. Using up what you have in the pantry and freezer before you go shopping again. 

  
Ok, that's all I  can think of for now. Let me know what you do for Low Spend 2025!

Here's the timeline of how I got gastritis and how I got cured.

**A little background.** Since 2019 I've been eating healthy home cooked meals with simple wholefood ingredients 99% of the time.

**How I got it:**

**1. February 2024 I** injured my knee and took **NSAIDs + omeprazole for 9 days (Flurbiprofen)**. It didn't help my knee.  
**2.** Couple of weeks later - **early March 2024** I got **back pain and nausea.** Few days later I developed nasty **dull pain and heaviness in my gut and chest** on the upper right side **under the ribs** with sharp pains all over my upper and middle abdomen. **Nausea was 24/7** but I never vomited.  
**3. 11.04.2024** I got admitted to GI tract in a local **hospital for upper gastroscopy and total colonoscopy** and some other tests and treatment. It took some time but I found a good GI doctor that admitted me there,  
**4.** After numerous tests I was **diagnosed** with erythematous-exudative **pangastritis and erosive duodenitis** which were deemed as **""serious inflammation""** by my doctors. **Biopsy for H. Pylori came back negative.** Doctors were confident that my conditions was caused by **NSAIDs** that I took shortly before my symptoms appeared.

**Treatment plan:**

**1.** I was told this can be cured with **drugs and diet** modifications. I was sent home with a prescription plan of **PPI** **lansoprazole** 30mg 2x1 for 30 days + 1x1 for another 30 days (total of **60 days**). (This didn't do much, later on that in next chapter).  
**2. Diet recommendations** were to **avoid spicy food, acidic food, deep fried food.** I was never into those so I thought it's going to be easy. I was told to reduce **coffee** and only have it after meals, not on an empty stomach.

**How I got cured:**

1. My condition continued **worsening for 4 more weeks** despite taking high dose PPI. Every time I had a **coffee or had any plant foods** it would be a step back. Cooked or raw fruits or vegetables or any plant matter that has any fiber would irritate me even from a single bite. 
2.  60 days of PPI went by with minimal to some improvement. My doctors gave me another 14 days of PPI which helped some more but it was not nearly enough (74 days total). I was still in pain and nausea every day. 
3.  **13.06.2024** I decided more needs to be done so I decided to **quit coffee** which helped my symptoms a bit. 
4.  **16.07.2024** I was forced to go fill **carnivore** diet since eating plants was painful and miserable. I could not tolerate any plants, not even white rice. This dramatically improved my symptoms. Eliminating all plant foods virtually made me **symptom free within a week.** 
5.  I went **high fat carnivore** diet for 6 months out of necessity. My diet before that was around 70%-80% animal based anyway so it was not difficult at all for me. The diet was **extremely pleasant** and easy to follow. It was cheaper. I ate around **2 pounds of fatty meat** per day (beef, pork, horse) to which I would add butter or more tallow or pork fat to get my calories in and some dairy like homemade yogurt and cheese. I **avoided eggs** because they would give me nausea. 
6.  **Every 30 days I would test** my tolerance to plant foods by eating a couple of spoonfuls of white rice or a piece of boiled carrot / boiled potato or some fruit. My tolerance did not improve until the end of month 5. 
7.  **16.01.2025** I tested eating some plant foods after 6 months and I got zero symptoms. Zero pain, zero nausea. I tested eggs, no symptoms. I decided to **end the carnivore diet** and **slowly introduce plant** foods again.

Now I can eat all the foods I would normally eat without any issues whatsoever. I can enjoy fruit again with no pain. I've been symptom free for \~2 months. The carnivore diet is a powerful tool. I can confidently say that going on an elimination diet where I removed all foods and **irritants** was a great decision which gave time and rest for my digestive tract and allowed it to heal. The PPIs helped as well but without this drastic diet it was not enough. I did blood panel tests just in case at month 3 and month 6 and they came back normal as usual.

There were more benefits that I saw from this diet like excellent hunger control + steady high energy and losing some fat and slimming down but I was never overweight to begin with so I won't bore you with this.

I plan to never drink coffee again, life is so much better without coffee it's not even funny. Better energy, better sleep, less anxiety, better everything.

I'd want to advise you If you were to ever notice that some particular food or drink irritates you and worsens your symptoms think about eliminating it from your life for a while. It may just work.",4,1738684293.0,Gastritis,3,1.0,False

So about 3 years ago I had a pretty bad infection. I think it was exacerbated by buying a house and an awful job. It was thanksgiving and obviously I had a big meal and I think that is when my body had had enough. 

I remember thinking I was having a heart attack. I couldn't breath, my HR was going crazy and I had anxiety through the roof. I barely slept that night and went to the hospital the next morning fearing the worst. 
They didn't find any respiratory or cardiac issues and sent me  home to follow up with the primary. 
I was about in tears by the time I got to her. I had barely eaten or slept. Had difficulty breathing, and was just generally feeling awful. Thankfully she was familiar with HPylori  and tested me. Bang we found it. 
I went on triple therapy immediately thinking I'd be back to normal soon. 

It was not soon. The antibiotics absolutely bombed my gut health and left me feeling almost worse off. (I didn't figure this out at the time but) My stomach would bloat up and push into my lungs/heart causing the difficulty breathing, and high HR. My anxiety was going crazy. Terrible acid reflux, and heartburn. 

My work performance fell off,  I could barely work out at the gym anymore. It was just an overly terrible time.

Now the good news: It freaking gets better. It just takes time guys. About 2.5 years later I finally felt normal again. Pretty much 100%. I can eat everything I used to, I can work out. I can drink alcohol and coffee again. 

A few things I would recommend,  eat plain as dirt. Gluten free helped a ton and very simple foods. Low sugar. I couldn't drink an energy drink for about a year without reactivating symptoms. Also omeprozole helped me probably the most. That was the turning point for my health. I am off it now but that really made the change. If your doctor isn't giving it to you yet, ask for it now. It really really helps. 

Most of all, know that it will be okay. Your heart and lungs are okay. 
Your gut controls so much and can make you feel like shit but stressing also increases symptoms. I used to stress myself so much and it did not help.

1ihki9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDIreland/comments/1ihki9g/prescribed_tyvanse/,Prescribed Tyvanse,"Hey guys,

I had my follow-up with a psychiatrist this morning who prescribed me 20mg of Tyvanse.

Basically, I woke up 20 minutes late for the zoom call and was still half asleep during the call so didn't get to inquire as much as I would have liked and didn't retain a whole lot from the appointment.

I know coffee and alcohol are out; is this during the titration period or for good? What about anything else with caffeine, probably not energy drinks but what about tea or something like coke?

In my management plan, it says something like ""Out- smoking, stress"" etc; I do smoke and I know it's awful but does that mean I need to quit before starting the medication?

  
Also, what is the duration of Tyvanse like? I know I need to take it in the morning and I read that it lasts about 12 hours, but I work in a pub and an average shift for me is 6pm to 3am. If I take it in the morning am I going to crash out mid shift? I'm just worried how it's going to affect my ability to work those kind of hours.

I'm a bit nervous about starting this, I've never been on any medication before - besides the pill - and am a bit of a hypochondriac (especially reading through the side effects).

Is there anything you guys can suggest to me taking this for the first time? Anything I can do to optimise taking this medication? I think I'll probably keep a journal of my reaction to medication along the way.",1,1738683654.0,ADHDIreland,2,1.0,False

1ihkg5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ihkg5b/who_is_the_bad_friend/,Who is the bad friend?,"This is about me (20F) and L (21F). We‚Äôve been friends since we were 4 and practically grew up together. L was always a bit anxious about everything. For example, when our class played soccer, she was too afraid to join. I always made sure she felt comfortable so she could participate. In other words, I was always there for her. Even when she chose another friend over me in elementary school because she was scared of her (this girl had more enemies than friends because she would literally hit people if she didn‚Äôt get her way).

Eventually, L told me she had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and chronic depression.

Now, fast forward to when we were 19/20. At that time, L‚Äôs depression was really severe, to the point where she stopped going to school. In early 2024, she told me she was on a dating app and had a date with D (I don‚Äôt know his age). She only mentioned the app after she had already made plans with D, and she sent her location just to be safe. Instead of meeting in public, he picked her up in his car, and they drove around. Personally, I found this surprising because, due to her anxiety disorder, she can‚Äôt even order a cup of coffee‚ÄîI always have to do it for her. I don‚Äôt mind, but considering she genuinely believes she‚Äôs going to die if she orders coffee, I don‚Äôt understand how she could get into a stranger‚Äôs car. But okay.

Every time she went on a date with him and I asked about it, she would respond with short answers like ‚Äúit was nice‚Äù or ‚Äúfun.‚Äù Eventually, I stopped asking because I kept getting those same vague replies. Since we all have busy lives, we often call each other with our mutual friend A (21F). But ever since she got into a relationship, she started skipping 8 out of 10 calls, always saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired‚Äù or ‚ÄúI need to shower.‚Äù We assumed this was because of D, but we decided to let it slide since it was her first relationship‚Äîaka the honeymoon stage.

After three months, I finally brought it up, saying that A and I didn‚Äôt feel like a priority anymore. She apologized and promised to do better. Things improved for about one or two weeks, but then the same pattern started all over again.

L texts me every day about one of her problems. And since we‚Äôre friends, I gladly listen. I‚Äôm a pretty positive person and rarely have anything to complain about, so I could handle it well. But there was a moment when I had issues with my parents and shared it with A and L. A responded with a lot of understanding, but L completely ignored my story and started talking about how her boyfriend was staying over for the first time. I was so angry that she couldn‚Äôt take a moment to listen to me.

There are also other weird things, like how she introduced D to two of her friends‚Äîfriends she constantly complains about to me‚Äîbut never introduced him to A or me. The only time I met him was at my brother‚Äôs birthday party because my mom told her he was welcome to come inside (they had a date on the same day, so he was supposed to drop her off at my place). When I pointed out that I found it odd that she didn‚Äôt make the effort to introduce him to us, she responded with, ‚ÄúDo you want an interview with him or something?‚Äù I was, and still am, so shocked that we see this so differently. She always labeled me as her number one, so I really don‚Äôt understand why those two friends got to meet him, but A and I didn‚Äôt. (By the way, this happened seven months into their relationship.)

In my country, we have a break from the end of April to early May. Since L is never available on weekends because she‚Äôs always with her boyfriend, she suggested going to the movies with A and me during the break (on a weekday, because D has to work then). Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt go because of my final-year internship, which continued as usual. I said I was available on the weekend instead. Her response was, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt then because I‚Äôll be with D, so we‚Äôll have to do something in the summer vacation instead.‚Äù I thought it was so dramatic that she couldn‚Äôt skip just one weekend with her boyfriend. For context, this conversation happened in mid-April, and the summer break doesn‚Äôt start until mid-July. I found it absolutely ridiculous.

Whenever I called her out on her behavior, she always said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm depressed.‚Äù I really do understand that it‚Äôs difficult to deal with, but I can‚Äôt help but feel that even if she weren‚Äôt depressed, she still wouldn‚Äôt make more time for me.

That‚Äôs why I decided to end the friendship. There were so many things she did differently after getting a boyfriend, and it hurt me that I put so much effort into our friendship while she couldn‚Äôt even make one weekend available for me. The only thing she told me was that sometimes I didn‚Äôt react nicely when she talked about D. I asked her when that had happened because, in my mind, I had always shown interest. But she didn‚Äôt want to go into detail.

It‚Äôs been five months since we stopped being friends, i know it is better for me, but it still bothers me. We used to understand each other so well and never argued, but ever since she got a boyfriend, it felt like we were on completely different wavelengths.

Met my wife at the height of my career and 2x my income. We had a great year being young and in love, then we learned we had little girl on the way.

1 week before we ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù she was pregnant, I was laid off.

Took that experience I had in traditional industries and took a total gamble jumping into a passion industry - cannabis, and it flopped in the worst way.

Landed a high profile decent salary/bennefits/parental leave job and worked 70 hour weeks for 6 months. Submitted Parental Leave. Got it approved. Got laid off 2 weeks before our little girls due date.

Months of stressful moments and dwindling savings in between as we relocated ok savings alone. Lots of beautiful moments with wife and baby that wouldn‚Äôt have been possible while working FT but then I landed another job. High potential but 1/3 of what I was earning at height of my career and constantly stressing me out.

Did that for 1.5 years until the company finally understood I was miserable and refused to pay me any more after I did 3 jobs (people resigned and were never backfilled). Ended up at my moms for 2 months before even she decided we ‚Äúneed to get your own place‚Äù, knowing how low we were at the time.

I landed a contract role and before my credit score had a chance to dip I was approved for a 2BR in a town we‚Äôd never been to. Won‚Äôt bore you with our slum lord experiences but after 1 year of strungglinf with the contract role I one day decided I wanted to open toa coffee shop, keep my expenses low and just work it till profitable -I imagined early mornings and closing before dinner.

Somehow with no savings and a declining credit score I found a non profit that funded me. What was supposed to be a cafe evolved into a full service restaurant due to someone we knew and another place breaking the lease suddenly. We jumped on it and took 2 months to build out on a budget while I worked FT.

We launched in Jan and it‚Äôs been a hit. 5 star reviews, we have repeat customers, we know our systems and the staff is generally happy - but we haven‚Äôt been paid a single dollar and with January being so cold/slow/trump scaring everyone politically - we‚Äôre about to close our doors after just 1-2 months in business.


If you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you. I fear I‚Äôve failed my family and will be dealing with these mistakes for years to come, lowering our quality of life and impacting my daughters development because of my lacking resources.

I see her eyes water when she sees Disney and Mickey Mouse and can only imagine how blown away she would be to take a trip to DisneyLand. I wish I could get my wife‚Äôs hair done st her favorite salon with a massage and nails - every 2 weeks if she wanted it.

I wish I could fix my moms car and our new tires so it wasn‚Äôt so unsafe to drive, not only for us as we borrow it but when I (hopefully) give it back one day.

I fear I‚Äôve failed as a man,  father, husband and just overall adult - but if I died I would just make their lives even harder.

1ihkajs,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ihkajs/my_30f_bf_30m_made_a_big_deal_about_me_renewing/,My (30f) bf (30m) made a big deal about me renewing my lease. Looking for feedback?,"When I met my bf he had just bought a house that needed some minor renovations/updates. Things like painting and new floors. He bought a house in February and we met in March. When my lease was ending in September I brought up the idea of living together since I was already spending a lot of time at his house. He never really gave a straight answer, just kind of dodged the question. I didn‚Äôt press, it had only been 6 months, his apprehension was fair. 

Fast forward to the following year. Several months after our 1 year anniversary and a couple months before my lease is up, I again bring up moving in together. He again dodges the question. At this point he has put down new flooring and painted 2 rooms. He‚Äôs not actively doing any other renovations. I‚Äôm still spending a lot of time there. I don‚Äôt bring up moving in together again. 

A month after I‚Äôve renewed my lease he throws a small fit and asks me why I didn‚Äôt talk to him about moving in. He says I should have just went to a month to month lease (which would have cost me more money) with no idea of knowing when his house will be ‚Äúready‚Äù for me. I was kind of surprised but I did feel like I messed up. I should have brought it up again closer to September?

Which brings us to present day. At this point I have been spending a significant amount of time at his house. Sometimes 4-5 days a week. I buy groceries for his house and then when I come back to my own house I have to buy more food. I cook dinner. He mentioned something about me helping him decorate his house so I find free stuff on Facebook groups (coffee tables, lamps) when I come back to my house he tells me how much he misses me and my dog. 

This past weekend we drove to my house so I could pick up some things that I needed and I groaned a little bit about how it‚Äôs kind of annoying to be living in 2 different places. Without thinking I said ‚ÄúI wish I could move now‚Äù. He mumbled something about the house not being ready. I shot back ‚Äúit‚Äôs never going to be ready‚Äù. and that was the end of it.

But I‚Äôm really over it. Why throw a fit about me renewing my lease if you weren‚Äôt ready for me to move in and you‚Äôre not even actively doing anything to make the house ready for me to move in?

1ihkaan,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1ihkaan/why_is_it_recommended_to_keep_natural_teeth_for/,Why is it recommended to keep natural teeth for as long as possible despite the cost to treatment them equaling how much a set of implants would cost?,"I'm (30M) someone in the US who has had extensive dental work since their mid 20s. I've had well over a dozen fillings, 3 root canals, and 4 crowns. I made a post on my old account asking about preventative options for dental work, even if it was expensive upfront so I could save in the long run. It was recommended that I keep my natural teeth for as long as possible despite doing around $20k worth of damage already. My teeth got this way due to not seeing the dentist throughout undergrad and overrelying on my parents to still schedule appointments on my behalf. I drank a ton of acidic drinks and energy drinks, which I've abstained from for 5 years and now take caffeine tablets instead (which I'm cutting down now as well). I also have the prescription toothpaste with the highest amount of flouride. I also have a nightguard that I'll likely need to replace since part near my left molars is stating to break off.

I'm going to be getting a cleaning later this afternoon as well. I'm extremely nervous since my dental hygiene and general self care has been bad (not as bad as when it was at its worst though). These past two weeks, I've flossed every 2-4 days (bleeding often happens on the gums around my crowned molars for whatever reason and not my other gums though) and would sometimes go to sleep after I got too exhausted and might not have brushed at all. When I'd wake up at night to go to the bathroom though, I'd brush when I'd have the chance.

After I graduate this May and get a job lined up post PhD, I just want to save up and get the $20-25k dental implants at a practice near me that specializes in full mouth implants. However, why is this not recommended at all? I'm willing to foot any procedures that are good preventative care. I should note that I have little interest in cosmetic care even though my teeth are completely coffee stained in this case.

Living in a region where sunlight is more myth than reality in the colder seasons, I wanted a reliable light therapy solution to beat those seasonal blues. This lamp promised 10,000 lux of bright white, UV-free light to simulate natural sunlight, and I was curious to see if it could deliver on its claims.

**Design & Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, the Verilux HappyLight impressed me with its sleek and compact design. Measuring 12.5 inches tall and weighing just 2 pounds, it easily found a spot on my desk. The detachable stand and wall-mounting option were welcome additions, offering flexibility in placement. The plastic build felt sturdy, although it wasn‚Äôt premium, but for its purpose, it seemed durable enough. The minimalistic design fit seamlessly into my workspace without screaming ‚Äútherapy device.‚Äù

[Explore Verilux HappyLight Full-Size pricing options on Amazon here.](https://agegene.com/product-reviews/verilux-vt20ww1-review-therapy-lamp-b0094hbu6i/)

**Ease of Use**  
Using the lamp felt almost second nature. The setup was a breeze‚Äîplug it in, decide on one of the two brightness levels, and you‚Äôre set. Switching between the two interchangeable lenses (the Comfort Lens and High Energy Lens) was painless and took mere seconds. Adjusting the lamp‚Äôs tilt to perfectly angle it for my needs was another thoughtful design element that made it all the more user-friendly.

**Performance & Effectiveness**  
The lamp‚Äôs 10,000 lux of light made a noticeable impact. I used it for 30 minutes every morning, and after just a week, I felt more energized and less lethargic. It seemed to help regulate my mood, especially on those dark, gloomy days. While I can‚Äôt claim it completely transformed my life, I did notice a change in my overall optimism and focus. Still, I have to wonder‚Äîwas it the placebo effect, or does this lamp truly work miracles? Either way, I wasn‚Äôt complaining.

**Comfort**  
Sitting in front of this lamp was a comfortable experience. The light was bright but not overwhelmingly harsh, especially when using the Comfort Lens. Initially, the brightness took some getting used to, but after a couple of sessions, it became a pleasant part of my routine. There were no annoying vibrations or excessive heat, which made it easy to incorporate into my morning routine while sipping coffee or reading emails.

**Battery Life & Charging**  
One downside is that the lamp requires a constant power supply. There‚Äôs no built-in battery, meaning portability is limited. While this wasn‚Äôt a dealbreaker for me since I mainly used it at my desk, it might be inconvenient for those who want a more mobile solution.

**Additional Features**  
The versatility of the Verilux HappyLight really stood out. The two lenses offered different light intensities, making it adaptable for varying sensitivity levels. The detachable stand was a nice touch, and the wall-mounting option added functionality for those short on table space. Unfortunately, it lacks a timer, which would have been a handy feature for ensuring optimal usage time without needing to set an external alarm.

**Safety & Skin Sensitivity**  
Since the lamp is UV-free, I didn‚Äôt experience any skin irritation‚Äîsomething I was initially concerned about. However, I‚Äôd recommend avoiding direct eye contact with the light, as prolonged exposure could strain the eyes. The instruction manual provided clear guidelines on safe usage, which I appreciated.

**Pros**

* Compact and aesthetically pleasing design.
* User-friendly with adjustable brightness and interchangeable lenses.
* Effectively boosts mood and energy levels.
* Versatile placement options with a detachable stand and wall-mount.
* UV-free light ensures safety for skin and eyes.

**Cons**

* No built-in battery limits portability.
* Lacks a timer for convenient session tracking.
* The plastic build, while robust, doesn‚Äôt feel premium.
* Light intensity might be overwhelming for first-time users without adjustment.
* Could include more light customization options.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to other popular brands like Carex and Circadian Optics, the Verilux HappyLight offers a good balance of features and simplicity. While Carex lamps are known for their robust build and additional features like timers, they come at a higher price point. Circadian Optics models, on the other hand, focus on sleek, modern design but often lack the same level of brightness customization as the Verilux. Where Verilux excels is in providing a compact, affordable solution with sufficient light output to rival more expensive options. However, if portability or advanced features like timers are your priority, other brands might be a better fit.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
The Verilux HappyLight Full-Size lamp sits comfortably in the mid-range price category for therapy lamps. While it may not have all the bells and whistles of its pricier competitors, its performance and versatility make it a solid investment for those looking to improve their mood and energy levels during darker months. I‚Äôd say it offers good value for money, especially for those new to light therapy.

She's gone no-contact her her family hates me.  I am devastated.

\--

This is my first reddit post.  I've read hundreds of threads on divorce and christian divorce for encouragement.  I finally wanted to put this out here trying to get some advice to help navigate my current nightmare of a divorce.

My STBXW (26F) and I (32M) are in the early process of getting a divorce that she wants.  We have two young boys under 5 which makes this even more painful.  I will lay out our story and pray you all have some advice that might help.  I don't see the marriage being saved at this point, but I do want to get through this heartbreak without crumbling.

I had graduated college and moved back to my hometown.  She had just graduated highschool and was friends with my sister.  I had stopped dating in college because all the women I met at school were focused on money, careers, they didn't want kids, and none of them were Christian.

My dream was to be a family man.  I met my wife-to-be at a church event, and didn't think upon it much because I knew we had an age gap.  I was enjoying post college life and trying to meet somebody my age in my home town.  I kept running into her at various community events, and we would talk more.  My family kept saying age is not a big deal after a while, and her family said the same thing.  I was young and dumb and didn't even know a brain isn't done developing until 25.  Neither of us had any life experience.  Her father was (still is) a pastor of a small fundamentalist church.  The sign says ""baptist"" but it's a reformed / fundamentalist group of about 30 people.  Her father had a rule that his daughters either lived ""under his roof or a husbands roof"".  I didn't see that as a huge red flag back then.

In a way, her being 18, with a father that required her to live under his roof or a husbands roof, I was her ticket out.  We met for coffee, I discovered she wanted kids, we were both Christian, she wanted to homeschool future kids (we were both homeschooled),  we enjoyed the outdoors, and her family seemed nice.

6 months later we're engaged, 6 months after that we're married.  We had some brief ""marriage counseling"" with an associate pastor and his wife (who have a very strained marriage today).  None of our pastors attended seminary, they basically ordain each other.  The church is independent and my wife's father answers to nobody as lead pastor.

Our marriage started off with challenges.  We were trying to build a small home ourselves to avoid debt, but didn't have the skills to pull the project off properly, so I had to get a mortgage and get a corporate job in the city.  We moved, worked the corporate job for 2 years, and life was pretty good.  The corporate job was toxic, but it paid the bills.  After 2 years, I got a new job working remote, but the lack of human interaction every day sent me into a deep depression.  I'd never been depressed before.  I self harmed, felt hopeless, didn't know who to turn to, and was in a bad place.  My parents had moved out of country for work, and I didn't have a close relationship with my dad (my dad broke our family by being a serial cheater, he and my mom divorce in my 3rd year of marriage).

My wife and I had been attending the church pastored by her father all along.  We drove one hour to attend from the city.  He tried to counsel me on my depression, he said I needed to have more faith and pray more.  He eventually got angry at me because his daughter (my wife) was scared and didn't know how to cope with my depression.  He said he was ""too close to the situation"", so he handed me off to the associate pastor who had given us ""marriage counseling"".  The associate pastor told me to pray more, have more faith.   I was still reeling, and I told my wife ""I regret us getting married so young, we were not ready for a big move, new jobs, debt, marital stresses, and life in general"" at the ages we got married.  I felt like a failure.

We eventually put up the house for sale to move back to our hometown near our support network.  I went to the doctor and got anti-depressants, and that helped tremendously.  My pastor father-in-law rails against ""psychology"" from the pulpit, so they didn't advise me to go on meds or get professional help.

We moved back to our hometown, which was amazing.  I was back in a community of people I knew and loved.  The meds helped so much.  Life was back on track and feeling wonderful.  My bride seemed happy.  We had a sweet little home we paid cash for.  We were at peace.

Then the unthinkable happened to shatter my world.  I left to visit my brother for a day trip.  My wife had an old highschool friend over for a girls move night.  I get home and the friend gives me a fast hug and leaves quickly.  My wife is acting jittery but I don't think much of it.  The next day she calls me on the phone and says ""I have to tell you something"".  ""My friend and I kissed last night"".  I was shocked.  I asked ""why, how, and why a girl??""  She kept acting strange on the phone, so I pressed more.  ""Did anything else happen?""

Eventually I pulled the entire truth out.  She and her girl friend had been fully intimate in our new home.  My pastor's daughter wife had had sex with a woman in our home when I was gone.  I felt numb.  She cried, she said I needed counseling, she wanted to fix it.

I tried praying about it.  I did go see a pastor one county over who was a lay counsellor - a guy my wife found for me to see.  He was not a trained therapist.  He was kind, but in over his head.  He told me to forgive her, pray for her, and move on.  4 sessions of this and I thought I was able to forgive her.

When I was 13 years old I discovered emails that exposed my dad's first affair.  This scarred me as a kid, and the trauma was buried deep.  My wife's infidelity was now added to this.

I did not want to divorce my wife.  I still cared for her.  I think my deep love for her was shattered, but I did care for her and I wanted to keep going in our marriage.  Perhaps this was the wrong move.  We have to wonderful boys now, and I'm so thankful for them being here.

I did not tell anyone about her affair for 6 years, other than that one pastor / counsellor.  I had shame, embarrassment, guilt and anger.  I did not know who to talk to as it couldn't be her father and my own father and I were very distant.

5 months later we're pregnant with our first baby boy.  He is born right at the time my dad has a second affair and my parents marriage explodes.  My adult siblings and I were devastated.  My dad was very cruel to me, my wife, and others in the divorce.  My mother was shattered - but has since healed and is now a stronger Christian than ever.  COVID then hits after my first boy is born and my parents divorce.  I am running a risky startup company at the time with lots of stress.  My wife's pregnancy kept her bed-ridden for months pre and post labor.  She had endometriosis and other complications.

We soldiered on through COVID, with a new baby, my parents divorce drama, and I was focused on work trying to provide as a single income family.

2 years later our second boy is born.  The divorce drama is settling down.  We move homes, my business is in the early stages of starting to fail, and we are happy enough living with our boys trying to make life work.  We were really just surviving.  My wife had intense anxiety, I was often stressed, the pregnancies were so hard, and we just kept pushing on.

I had become very controlling about finances as things were tight.  We spent a fortune on healthcare for my wife with the pregnancies, and I was stressed about that.  She was not the most healthy eater, and I would be controlling about ensuring she cooked for us instead of us getting fast food or junk food.  As a teen, my mom had breast cancer that almost killed her, and after that I became hardcore about healthy food.  My wife didn't share the same passion, but when things like an $800 cavity bill happened early in our marriage I tried to show her why sugar-free / healthy eating was important.

I was too harsh and controlling, I see that now.  I do understand that I had triggers around finances (watching my dad stress about money), healthy food (with my mom's cancer), and triggers around infidelity (my wife joking about her cute dentist or reading romance books).

We had a stressed marriage, but I was committed to supporting my wife and boys, handling finances well, eating clean, and trying to do our best.  She said her dad wanted us to go to a marriage retreat about a year ago, but I was so busy with the business failing I didn't think we could do it.  I so wish we had gone.  She didn't tell me she was miserable or we were in crisis.

She told me this past summer I was being like my parents and being ""emotionally abusive"".  I shut down immediately.  I looked up the traits for that and denied it, because I didn't meet hardly any of them.  I knew I had high standards for both of us, but it was over healthy food and smart finances and to me that was practical.  Her dad and I had been meeting periodically to study a book at church on handling anger.  He had no idea my wife had cheated on me with a woman.  My anger was a symptom of much deeper issues.

Fast forward, my business fails, I get a 9-5 job, and I finally think we can relax and focus on our young boys, homeschooling, and a simple life.  For the past 2 years my wife started reading books daily.  I did not see this as a red flag, but she has read over 100 romance books per year and bragged about it.  Many of these books were smutty, and I am just now seeing this was escapism for her.  Once or twice when she's been drinking she's even brought up the topic of a threesome, which was horrifying at a deep level...  She's an incredibly sexual person but the way it manifests does not align with a Godly life.

Our 5 year old is behind with his educational milestones for letters and counting.  My wife has spent 5+ hours daily on instagram in recent years, after I asked her to check her screen time.   Between the romance books, social media, and netflix I realized when my business failed that she was coping with media.  She is not a bad mother, but the boys had too much screen time.

Before Christmas of 2024 we were traveling and go to a restaurant, she snaps at me as I'm reading the menu aloud to my kids.  I get angry, and ask why it cannot ever be easy with us.  I tell her she must apologize.  She rarely ever apologizes when she's in the wrong.  We have a huge fight in a park nearby, our little boys are playing out of earshot.  She said she's been miserable for all 8 years, I say I'm only here for the boys at this point.  She said she's been telling her parents about all my anger and ""emotional abuse"".   She says her father asked if she's always been faithful to men, and she told him the truth ""no"".  She told them about her affair, or at least some.

I do apologize to her, but she says my apologies mean nothing anymore.  She says she wants to separate.  She sleeps away from me in the vacation house.

We cut the trip short, we drive home and things seem ok, we spend one more night as a family in our home.  The next morning she packs her things, and leaves for her parents house with the boys.

We have a 6+ week separation.

When my parents and siblings were shocked about the separation I finally told our whole story, I shared about my wife's affair with a woman.  My in-laws and wife went nuclear.  They and their church couldn't believe I shared that story.  My wife said she wanted a divorce shortly after this.

She asks for me to not attend our church, I agree.  I try to talk with her father about our pain-filled story.  He is cold and furious with me.  He said I murdered her heart.  He said I was an unbeliever who ""abandoned her emotionally"".  He told me that he met with all the church deacons one month prior and ""prayed that God with deliver my wife from me"".  He said that ""my wife and children were now under the protection of the church in his home"".  I have never laid a finger on my wife.  I have always been faithful to her.  After my own fathers infidelity I committed to never betray her.  I'm an involved father, and I loved date nights and vacations with my wife.  I have been strict and direct with how we manage a household as young parents with a single income - I could have been less harsh, I do see that.  However, nothing I have done warrants a biblical divorce.

I tried reaching out to 2 church members for some support.  Silence.  My father in law ""warned the church"" that I would reach out for sympathy.  I'm going to a new church now that is not fundamentalist.

My wife's parents hate me, and my wife has gone no-contact.  She is using her credit card that I pay for new tattoos, tattoo removal (a letter she got for my name, which I never asked for), and continuing to live her life while not communicating with me at all.

I see my boys a few hours daily.  She has her parents act as proxy.  I will have to pay her legal bills and my legal bills.  She and her father threw all my hopes and talks of reconciliation in my face.  They said it was too late.

Her father said I was ""delusional"" for reaching out to church members seeking some support or help.

I love my boys so much.  I still love my wife and had been praying for reconciliation.

After the divorce I'll be beyond strapped financially.

I have lost faith in Christian marriage, marriage in general, and frankly people.

I was hoping to hear some advice here.  Thanks for reading if you got this far.",2,1738682771.0,Divorce,2,1.0,False

Now, I have always been vocal about her favoriting my siblings especially my brother yet she always turns it on me and calls me crazy to think that she could love one of her kids more. She keeps forgetting to pick me up when I have a lesson at night and I have to go back home alone after 10 pm (like a 20 minute walk) and she barely even acknowledges my needs (I asked her to buy me shoes because my shoes were almost entirely ripped and was ignored for over 3 months) yet she gives money to my brother so he can get something to eat on his way to college everyday (he's literally working so he's earning for himself). 
When I ask her for money to go out she will either ignore me , yell at me or give me awfully little money that won't even be enough for a small coffee and will ask for change. When I confronted her about it she confessed to me that she sees me as the reason for the economic crisis that started in our country two years after I was born (also I have been told many times that I was never wanted and was just an accident that they kept) . Now that is insane! How was I the cause of an economic crisis for the WHOLE country when I was just 2 years old ?! Isn't that illogical? She also has made it clear many times that when I turn 18 I have to leave the house and go get a job and live somewhere alone to ""Learn how to save up"" which I find annoying because my two siblings still live at home even tho they're 20 and she never asked them to leave while she's done that for me since I was 14. So how do I even live with her at this point? How do I deal with this situation?",4,1738682682.0,Advice,8,0.83,False

If you‚Äôre in the market for an **automatic coffee machine** that‚Äôs reliable and well-built, I strongly recommend **steering clear of the Delonghi Magnifica Evo**. My experience with this **espresso machine** has been nothing short of a disaster, from **poor durability** to **frustrating customer service**.

# The Machine Malfunctions Quickly

For the **first month**, the **Delonghi Magnifica Evo** worked as expected, producing **espresso shots**, **black coffee**, and **milk drinks** with minimal effort. The **built-in grinder** seemed to work well, and the **lattecrema system** created decent **milk texture** for drinks like **latte macchiatos**. However, that‚Äôs where the positives ended.

After about a **month of use**, the **ground coffee** light turned on and refused to turn off. This meant the **brewing process** was completely blocked because the machine falsely detected a full container of used **coffee grounds**. I reached out to **Delonghi customer service**, and after sending them a video of the issue, they confirmed that it needed **repair**.

# Painfully Slow Repair Process

Delonghi initially told me the **repair process** would take **about 10 days** (send me a box, fix the machine, and return it). Instead, I waited **a month** before I finally got my machine back.

Fast forward **less than a week** after receiving my supposedly ‚Äúrepaired‚Äù **Delonghi machine**, and the **exact same issue happened again**. The **control panel** displayed the **grounds full light**, and the machine wouldn‚Äôt brew.

# Terrible Customer Service ‚Äì Blame the Customer, Not the Machine

When I called **Delonghi customer service** again, I requested a **refund** since this was clearly a **defective machine**. The rep said she needed to check with **higher-ups**, only to come back and tell me I was out of luck. **Since I had owned the machine for over 30 days**, they refused to issue a refund and would only offer another **repair**.

To make matters worse, the customer service rep had the audacity to **scold me** about the type of **coffee beans** I was using. Apparently, using **medium roast beans** or beans with the wrong **grind size** could be the reason my machine wasn‚Äôt working‚Äîrather than admitting that their **automatic coffee machine** is just poorly built.

# Common Questions About the Delonghi Magnifica Evo (And My Honest Answers)

* **What is the life expectancy of a Delonghi Magnifica Evo?** **Not very long.** Mine malfunctioned after just **one month**, and the **repair process** did nothing to fix the issue.
* **Can you make regular coffee with the Magnifica Evo?** Yes, but **switching between espresso and regular coffee beans is a hassle** due to the **bean hopper** design.
* **Is the Delonghi Magnifica any good?** **Absolutely not.** The **price point** might seem reasonable for a **mid-range super-automatic espresso machine**, but **the quality is awful**. You‚Äôre better off going to your **local coffee shop** or buying a more **reliable machine**.

# Final Verdict ‚Äì Do NOT Buy This Machine

At this **price range**, you expect a **coffee maker** that lasts more than a month and a **customer service team** that stands behind their product. Instead, you get a **defective machine**, a **slow repair process**, and a company that **blames you** rather than fixing their **coffee machines**.

If you‚Äôre serious about **coffee quality** and want a **great machine** that won‚Äôt cause headaches, **look elsewhere**. Consider any other super automatic or a **traditional espresso machine** with a **manual steam wand** for **better results** and **greater control**.

Do yourself a favor and **skip the Delonghi Magnifica Evo**‚Äîyou‚Äôll save yourself **time, frustration, and money**.

She's gone no-contact her her family hates me.  I am devastated.

\--

This is my first reddit post.  I've read hundreds of threads on divorce and christian divorce for encouragement.  I finally wanted to put this out here trying to get some advice to help navigate my current nightmare of a divorce.

My STBXW (26F) and I (32M) are in the early process of getting a divorce that she wants.  We have two young boys under 5 which makes this even more painful.  I will lay out our story and pray you all have some advice that might help.  I don't see the marriage being saved at this point, but I do want to get through this heartbreak without crumbling.

I had graduated college and moved back to my hometown.  She had just graduated highschool and was friends with my sister.  I had stopped dating in college because all the women I met at school were focused on money, careers, they didn't want kids, and none of them were Christian.

My dream was to be a family man.  I met my wife-to-be at a church event, and didn't think upon it much because I knew we had an age gap.  I was enjoying post college life and trying to meet somebody my age in my home town.  I kept running into her at various community events, and we would talk more.  My family kept saying age is not a big deal after a while, and her family said the same thing.  I was young and dumb and didn't even know a brain isn't done developing until 25.  Neither of us had any life experience.  Her father was (still is) a pastor of a small fundamentalist church.  The sign says ""baptist"" but it's a reformed / fundamentalist group of about 30 people.  Her father had a rule that his daughters either lived ""under his roof or a husbands roof"".  I didn't see that as a huge red flag back then.

In a way, her being 18, with a father that required her to live under his roof or a husbands roof, I was her ticket out.  We met for coffee, I discovered she wanted kids, we were both Christian, she wanted to homeschool future kids (we were both homeschooled),  we enjoyed the outdoors, and her family seemed nice.

6 months later we're engaged, 6 months after that we're married.  We had some brief ""marriage counseling"" with an associate pastor and his wife (who have a very strained marriage today).  None of our pastors attended seminary, they basically ordain each other.  The church is independent and my wife's father answers to nobody as lead pastor.

Our marriage started off with challenges.  We were trying to build a small home ourselves to avoid debt, but didn't have the skills to pull the project off properly, so I had to get a mortgage and get a corporate job in the city.  We moved, worked the corporate job for 2 years, and life was pretty good.  The corporate job was toxic, but it paid the bills.  After 2 years, I got a new job working remote, but the lack of human interaction every day sent me into a deep depression.  I'd never been depressed before.  I self harmed, felt hopeless, didn't know who to turn to, and was in a bad place.  My parents had moved out of country for work, and I didn't have a close relationship with my dad (my dad broke our family by being a serial cheater, he and my mom divorce in my 3rd year of marriage).

My wife and I had been attending the church pastored by her father all along.  We drove one hour to attend from the city.  He tried to counsel me on my depression, he said I needed to have more faith and pray more.  He eventually got angry at me because his daughter (my wife) was scared and didn't know how to cope with my depression.  He said he was ""too close to the situation"", so he handed me off to the associate pastor who had given us ""marriage counseling"".  The associate pastor told me to pray more, have more faith.   I was still reeling, and I told my wife ""I regret us getting married so young, we were not ready for a big move, new jobs, debt, marital stresses, and life in general"" at the ages we got married.  I felt like a failure.

We eventually put up the house for sale to move back to our hometown near our support network.  I went to the doctor and got anti-depressants, and that helped tremendously.  My pastor father-in-law rails against ""psychology"" from the pulpit, so they didn't advise me to go on meds or get professional help.

We moved back to our hometown, which was amazing.  I was back in a community of people I knew and loved.  The meds helped so much.  Life was back on track and feeling wonderful.  My bride seemed happy.  We had a sweet little home we paid cash for.  We were at peace.

Then the unthinkable happened to shatter my world.  I left to visit my brother for a day trip.  My wife had an old highschool friend over for a girls move night.  I get home and the friend gives me a fast hug and leaves quickly.  My wife is acting jittery but I don't think much of it.  The next day she calls me on the phone and says ""I have to tell you something"".  ""My friend and I kissed last night"".  I was shocked.  I asked ""why, how, and why a girl??""  She kept acting strange on the phone, so I pressed more.  ""Did anything else happen?""

Eventually I pulled the entire truth out.  She and her girl friend had been fully intimate in our new home.  My pastor's daughter wife had had sex with a woman in our home when I was gone.  I felt numb.  She cried, she said I needed counseling, she wanted to fix it.

I tried praying about it.  I did go see a pastor one county over who was a lay counsellor - a guy my wife found for me to see.  He was not a trained therapist.  He was kind, but in over his head.  He told me to forgive her, pray for her, and move on.  4 sessions of this and I thought I was able to forgive her.

When I was 13 years old I discovered emails that exposed my dad's first affair.  This scarred me as a kid, and the trauma was buried deep.  My wife's infidelity was now added to this.

I did not want to divorce my wife.  I still cared for her.  I think my deep love for her was shattered, but I did care for her and I wanted to keep going in our marriage.  Perhaps this was the wrong move.  We have to wonderful boys now, and I'm so thankful for them being here.

I did not tell anyone about her affair for 6 years, other than that one pastor / counsellor.  I had shame, embarrassment, guilt and anger.  I did not know who to talk to as it couldn't be her father and my own father and I were very distant.

5 months later we're pregnant with our first baby boy.  He is born right at the time my dad has a second affair and my parents marriage explodes.  My adult siblings and I were devastated.  My dad was very cruel to me, my wife, and others in the divorce.  My mother was shattered - but has since healed and is now a stronger Christian than ever.  COVID then hits after my first boy is born and my parents divorce.  I am running a risky startup company at the time with lots of stress.  My wife's pregnancy kept her bed-ridden for months pre and post labor.  She had endometriosis and other complications.

We soldiered on through COVID, with a new baby, my parents divorce drama, and I was focused on work trying to provide as a single income family.

2 years later our second boy is born.  The divorce drama is settling down.  We move homes, my business is in the early stages of starting to fail, and we are happy enough living with our boys trying to make life work.  We were really just surviving.  My wife had intense anxiety, I was often stressed, the pregnancies were so hard, and we just kept pushing on.

I had become very controlling about finances as things were tight.  We spent a fortune on healthcare for my wife with the pregnancies, and I was stressed about that.  She was not the most healthy eater, and I would be controlling about ensuring she cooked for us instead of us getting fast food or junk food.  As a teen, my mom had breast cancer that almost killed her, and after that I became hardcore about healthy food.  My wife didn't share the same passion, but when things like an $800 cavity bill happened early in our marriage I tried to show her why sugar-free / healthy eating was important.

I was too harsh and controlling, I see that now.  I do understand that I had triggers around finances (watching my dad stress about money), healthy food (with my mom's cancer), and triggers around infidelity (my wife joking about her cute dentist or reading romance books).

We had a stressed marriage, but I was committed to supporting my wife and boys, handling finances well, eating clean, and trying to do our best.  She said her dad wanted us to go to a marriage retreat about a year ago, but I was so busy with the business failing I didn't think we could do it.  I so wish we had gone.  She didn't tell me she was miserable or we were in crisis.

She told me this past summer I was being like my parents and being ""emotionally abusive"".  I shut down immediately.  I looked up the traits for that and denied it, because I didn't meet hardly any of them.  I knew I had high standards for both of us, but it was over healthy food and smart finances and to me that was practical.  Her dad and I had been meeting periodically to study a book at church on handling anger.  He had no idea my wife had cheated on me with a woman.  My anger was a symptom of much deeper issues.

Fast forward, my business fails, I get a 9-5 job, and I finally think we can relax and focus on our young boys, homeschooling, and a simple life.  For the past 2 years my wife started reading books daily.  I did not see this as a red flag, but she has read over 100 romance books per year and bragged about it.  Many of these books were smutty, and I am just now seeing this was escapism for her.  Once or twice when she's been drinking she's even brought up the topic of a threesome, which was horrifying at a deep level...  She's an incredibly sexual person but the way it manifests does not align with a Godly life.

Our 5 year old is behind with his educational milestones for letters and counting.  My wife has spent 5+ hours daily on instagram in recent years, after I asked her to check her screen time.   Between the romance books, social media, and netflix I realized when my business failed that she was coping with media.  She is not a bad mother, but the boys had too much screen time.

Before Christmas of 2024 we were traveling and go to a restaurant, she snaps at me as I'm reading the menu aloud to my kids.  I get angry, and ask why it cannot ever be easy with us.  I tell her she must apologize.  She rarely ever apologizes when she's in the wrong.  We have a huge fight in a park nearby, our little boys are playing out of earshot.  She said she's been miserable for all 8 years, I say I'm only here for the boys at this point.  She said she's been telling her parents about all my anger and ""emotional abuse"".   She says her father asked if she's always been faithful to men, and she told him the truth ""no"".  She told them about her affair, or at least some.

I do apologize to her, but she says my apologies mean nothing anymore.  She says she wants to separate.  She sleeps away from me in the vacation house.

We cut the trip short, we drive home and things seem ok, we spend one more night as a family in our home.  The next morning she packs her things, and leaves for her parents house with the boys.

We have a 6+ week separation.

When my parents and siblings were shocked about the separation I finally told our whole story, I shared about my wife's affair with a woman.  My in-laws and wife went nuclear.  They and their church couldn't believe I shared that story.  My wife said she wanted a divorce shortly after this.

She asks for me to not attend our church, I agree.  I try to talk with her father about our pain-filled story.  He is cold and furious with me.  He said I murdered her heart.  He said I was an unbeliever who ""abandoned her emotionally"".  He told me that he met with all the church deacons one month prior and ""prayed that God with deliver my wife from me"".  He said that ""my wife and children were now under the protection of the church in his home"".  I have never laid a finger on my wife.  I have always been faithful to her.  After my own fathers infidelity I committed to never betray her.  I'm an involved father, and I loved date nights and vacations with my wife.  I have been strict and direct with how we manage a household as young parents with a single income - I could have been less harsh, I do see that.  However, nothing I have done warrants a biblical divorce.

I tried reaching out to 2 church members for some support.  Silence.  My father in law ""warned the church"" that I would reach out for sympathy.  I'm going to a new church now that is not fundamentalist.

My wife's parents hate me, and my wife has gone no-contact.  She is using her credit card that I pay for new tattoos, tattoo removal (a letter she got for my name, which I never asked for), and continuing to live her life while not communicating with me at all.

I see my boys a few hours daily.  She has her parents act as proxy.  I will have to pay her legal bills and my legal bills.  She and her father threw all my hopes and talks of reconciliation in my face.  They said it was too late.

Her father said I was ""delusional"" for reaching out to church members seeking some support or help.

I love my boys so much.  I still love my wife and had been praying for reconciliation.

After the divorce I'll be beyond strapped financially.

I have lost faith in Christian marriage, marriage in general, and frankly people.

1ihjxs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ihjxs8/feeling_resentful_towards_bfs_likely_job_change/,"Feeling resentful towards bfs likely job change, but also guilty for it","My bf has been having a hard time with his boss at his current job. He came in a few months back and at first seemed to be cool, now has gotten micromanagy and doing that fun thing where he gets upset his telepathic instruction isn‚Äôt landing type of thing. The way my bf has described it is ‚Äòit feels like I‚Äôm fired even though I‚Äôm not‚Äô, not a lot usually gets to him, but this has made him anxious and I can tell it just puts a general damper on life for him. You can tell his vibes are just off dreading having to sleep cause when he wakes up he has to go back sort of thing. I don‚Äôt want this for him, but I‚Äôm starting to feel resentful over what the likely alternative is‚Ä¶..

A couple years back before he got this job, he worked for a different manufacturer , maintaining production lines -part of the reason they left is that they were theoretically closing down operations, and this newer job was geared more towards budgeting/planning/coding out machines that are used-essentially more experience opportunities. Now the old place was supposed to be shut down by like q1 2022, but since supply chains are a hot mess, they‚Äôve been delayed to put it likely-they‚Äôll probably be open another year or two. 

Back when he worked there, I had mixed feelings. Before they started shifting towards shutdown, he worked a rotating 3 on 3 off 2 on 2 off schedule, 12 hr shifts from 6-6I HATED it, mostly because that only gave us two weekends per month of time we were both free, and it felt like we were visiting family every one of them- I also couldn‚Äôt plan around any weekends that MIGHT be free, because planning on his side is..last minute. We‚Äôve rescheduled his nieces birthday dinner twice now(we‚Äôre supposed to do it two weekends ago, then this past weekend, now it‚Äôs -maybe- this coming weekend). I also didn‚Äôt love that on the days he had off during the week, he was very much on a ‚Äòweekend schedule‚Äô and mentality-staying up late, we didn‚Äôt do our nightly routine, and I found myself turning in early on my weekends because going to bed together/having that nightly wind down is more important to me than it is to him. I‚Äôll be honest that I don‚Äôt think this has ever really changed, I just got used to going strait from him on his computer to us sleeping- I‚Äôve always liked getting in bed early and getting to snuggle and talk with my partner. I guess I just normalized to it cause he just says he doesn‚Äôt get where I‚Äôm coming from and eventually I just got into a routine of staying up/not getting ready for and in bed until literal bedtime. Anyway-by the time he left, I had no complaints- because the schedule had shifted to 7-4 m-f, a very normal schedule I could work and plan around easily. It‚Äôs also his current schedule. 

Now since the old place still has some time left, he‚Äôs thinking of going back. His old boss is in contact with him and says they‚Äôd love to have him back- and he‚Äôs gone through the first phone hr interview thus far. At first I was kinda excited because that job is just one down over from my job/is in a town I drive through to go to work- and I really liked getting to stop by and drop off coffees or a bagel and get to say hey and sometimes meet up during the day. As the potential realities of the situation are hitting however, I‚Äôm starting to become resentful-and I feel guilty for both putting my own feelings above what‚Äôs best for his mental health and also for already feeling grumpy despite theoretically nothing being confirmed yet- the issue is the schedule. From what it sounds like, he not only would be going back to the rotating schedule that only gives two free weekends per month- but it also is sounding like it‚Äôd likely be night shift. I did ask what that entails- and he told me the night shift schedule when he was there last was from 5:45 pm to am- completely opposite to my own schedule. 

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how we won‚Äôt be cooking dinner at night together, how I won‚Äôt get to sleep with my partner even on nights he has off during the week because, well, that‚Äôs not when he‚Äôll be sleeping. I already am a morning person and have made great efforts to not wake him up when I‚Äôm up on the weekends (usually 9-11 depending on how long I can keep the dog and cat at bay) and he‚Äôll sleep I. To 11-1 depending. We started talking about it last night and he mentioned getting blackout curtains and it just broke something in me. I felt like asking him if he even remembers how shit this schedule was last time and it wasn‚Äôt even night shift-and if he is really so nonchalant about the strain it will put on our relationship- but that feels so manipulative. He keeps saying that no matter what it‚Äôll be temporary since the place is shutting down, and that he really doesn‚Äôt mind working night shift. Idk, it just makes me feel like he doesn‚Äôt mind not seeing me most of the time. 

Part of this is I HATE alone time, but I also don‚Äôt have the energy to go out and do things most week nights after work. I have a weekly get together/coffee date with my old neighbors/friends, and I normally will do a brunch with friends or my mum on the weekends that we aren‚Äôt traveling states to go see family or go to a show or something- but I just want to get home from work- strip off my scrubs and put on comfy clothes and hang out with my best friend. Usually I sit and watch a show or scroll on my phone while he games on his computer- but that‚Äôll be broken up with us watching something together or playing a game together- mostly I just like having him present, ya know? Anyway, I‚Äôm dreading it. We‚Äôre finally in an apartment I love, I have an amazing and flexible job, and have gotten back into exercising- and I thought to myself at least if the world is going to shit I have my happy little personal life to wrap myself up in. Now I feel like I‚Äôm just going to be sitting, doom scrolling, alone for the next couple years. 

TLDR bf is likely leaving his stressful job (boss) to go back to an old position, but the likely new  schedule will be rotating nights- I‚Äôm resentful and angry that our relationship will likely suffer from it, but also feel guilty for putting those feelings over his mental health ",1,1738682178.0,Vent,4,1.0,False

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

EVERYTHING tastes like Starbucks roast - which I fucking HATE. I buy fresh coffee, use often so it doesn't get stale. Not a fan of dark, oily beans and like the citrusy type of flavours, bordering on sour.

I've been a bit lax with maintenance but have gotten on top of it - cafiza, descal, grindz, clear water backflushes, etc. But still getting that dark/french roast kind of flavour instead of the high, caramel, citrusy flavour that the exact same beans would produce in the past.

I came across a conversation that she had with another guy on a business trip about 3 years ago. There wasn't much said basically this guy had just reached out to her asking how long she was in town she had said she leaves the next day. This guy had asked if they could get together for a coffee or something the next time she was around and she said yes she would be happy to keep him posted. 

Obviously I don't know anything about the situation other than what I saw in these text messages. But she's telling me that this guy was just the waiter at a restaurant and ask for her social media and she didn't want to be rude so she gave it to him and responded. She also tried to tell me that he only asked her out for coffee and that it was innocent.. 

 I thought I trusted her big time. I just can't for the life of me understand why she would entertain this idea with somebody else and act like it was so innocent.

I'm going crazy I can't eat I can't sleep I'm up at night sick. I just can't shake the feeling like she cheated on me or at least was entertaining the idea

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.
I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but Ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-34 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

While companies often focus on marketing campaigns, logos, and digital presence, one crucial yet often overlooked element is **customizable** [**office supplies**](https://www.truegether.com/category/collectibles). These seemingly simple items play a significant role in communicating your brand's values, professionalism, and uniqueness.

**The Power of First Impressions**

First impressions are formed within **7 seconds**, according to a study published in *Psychological Science*. This principle doesn't just apply to people‚Äîit extends to businesses as well. When a client visits your office or receives a package from your company, the appearance of your office supplies can leave a lasting impression.

Customizable items like branded pens, notepads, folders, and even coffee mugs create a cohesive and professional look. This consistency signals that your business pays attention to detail, a trait often associated with reliability and competence. A **2021 survey by Lucidpress** revealed that consistent brand presentation across all platforms, including office materials, can increase revenue by up to **23%**. This statistic emphasizes the importance of visual consistency, even in the most seemingly trivial items.

Imagine walking into two different offices: one with mismatched, generic supplies scattered across desks, and another where every notepad, pen, and file folder is thoughtfully branded. The latter exudes a sense of organization and professionalism, making clients and partners feel confident in the company's capabilities.

**Reinforcing Brand Consistency**

Brand identity isn't just about logos and color schemes; it's about creating a unified image that resonates with your target audience. Customizable office supplies ensure that your brand's voice remains consistent internally and externally.

Consider this: employees using branded notebooks or pens subconsciously reinforce the brand's ethos in their daily routines. This consistency extends to client interactions, where receiving documents in branded folders or signing contracts with company-logo pens subtly reinforces brand trust. A **Forrester report** highlights that businesses with strong, consistent branding are **20% more successful** than those without.

This internal reinforcement helps build a corporate culture centered around the brand. Employees become ambassadors of the brand not only through their work but also through the tools they use daily. This silent yet powerful form of branding ensures that the company‚Äôs identity is woven into the very fabric of its operations.

**Enhancing Professionalism and Credibility**

Professionalism goes beyond dress codes and email etiquette. According to a **2019 survey by Staples**, **86% of business professionals** believe that well-designed office supplies contribute to a company's professional image. Custom supplies like letterheads, business cards, and envelopes demonstrate that your company takes itself seriously.

For example, imagine receiving an invoice on plain paper versus one on a customized letterhead with a sleek design. The latter not only looks more credible but also instills greater confidence in the company's legitimacy. In industries where trust is paramount‚Äîlike finance, law, or healthcare‚Äîthese subtle details can be the difference between securing a deal and losing it.

Additionally, custom supplies signal to stakeholders that the company is established and organized. This can be especially important for startups and small businesses looking to build credibility in competitive markets.

**A Cost-Effective Marketing Tool**

Customizable office supplies double as **cost-effective marketing tools**. Unlike traditional advertisements that have a limited lifespan, branded office items have longevity. A **2020 ASI (Advertising Specialty Institute) study** found that promotional products like pens and notepads are kept for an average of **8-12 months**, providing prolonged exposure.

Moreover, when employees attend meetings, conferences, or networking events with branded supplies, your company gains free, passive advertising. This constant visibility helps keep your brand top-of-mind for potential clients and partners. Consider branded notebooks at a corporate seminar: not only do they serve a functional purpose, but they also act as walking billboards long after the event concludes.

Further, the return on investment (ROI) for branded supplies is significantly higher compared to digital ads. While a pay-per-click campaign might yield temporary visibility, a well-designed notebook or pen remains in circulation, continuously reinforcing brand awareness.

**Fostering Employee Engagement and Pride**

Internal branding is just as important as external marketing. Custom office supplies can foster a sense of belonging among employees. When staff members use items that showcase the company logo or tagline, it cultivates a sense of pride and unity.

According to a **Gallup report**, companies with high employee engagement are **21% more profitable**. Small gestures, like providing customized desk organizers, branded water bottles, or company-themed planners, can significantly boost morale and reinforce a positive workplace culture. Employees who feel connected to the brand are more likely to be motivated, productive, and loyal.

Custom supplies also create a cohesive work environment, reducing feelings of disconnection, especially in remote or hybrid work setups. Personalized items make employees feel valued, enhancing their emotional connection to the company.

**Customization Options That Reflect Brand Identity**

To effectively reflect your brand identity, consider customizing office supplies in the following ways:

1.¬†¬†¬† **Logo and Color Scheme:** Ensure your logo is prominently displayed, and stick to your brand's color palette to maintain visual coherence.

2.¬†¬†¬† **Typography:** Use fonts consistent with your brand guidelines. Typography plays a critical role in brand recognition.

3.¬†¬†¬† **Taglines and Slogans:** Incorporate catchy phrases that encapsulate your brand's mission, vision, or values.

4.¬†¬†¬† **Quality of Materials:** High-quality supplies reflect a premium brand, while eco-friendly materials showcase sustainability values. According to **Nielsen's Global Corporate Sustainability Report**, **66% of global consumers** are willing to pay more for sustainable goods, indicating the importance of eco-friendly branding.

5.¬†¬†¬† **Functional Design:** Customize items that are not just aesthetic but also highly functional, ensuring they are frequently used, maximizing brand exposure.

**Real-World Examples of Customizable Office Supplies Impact**

* **Google:** Known for its vibrant and playful brand identity, Google uses colorful office supplies that reflect its creative culture. From bright pens to quirky desk toys, every item mirrors Google's innovative spirit.
* **Apple:** Emphasizes minimalism and sleek design in its custom stationery, aligning with its sophisticated, cutting-edge brand image. Their use of clean lines and monochrome palettes reflects simplicity and elegance.
* **Patagonia:** Uses eco-friendly materials for office supplies, reinforcing its commitment to environmental sustainability. Recycled paper notebooks and biodegradable pens highlight Patagonia's environmental ethos, resonating with eco-conscious consumers and employees alike.

1ihjo89,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1ihjo89/that_time_her_entitlement_nearly_killed_my_dad/,That Time Her Entitlement Nearly Killed My Dad.,"Hi Reddit. It‚Äôs been a while. I normally post these kinds of stories in another sub but this one feels more appropriate for the entitled people sub. 

My dad has this long time girlfriend who I call Big Peach. Named for fake tan, pink hair and general resemblance to the fruit. She‚Äôs awful. My siblings and I hate her and frankly the feeling is definitely mutual. She lies, manipulates and boundary stomps, all while keeping up this fake, too sweet, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to be a bother but-‚Äù act. It‚Äôs a very, very long story. A lot of it is there in my post history if you want it but it‚Äôs a lot of reading and I‚Äôm not going to recommend it if you‚Äôre just looking to pass time like many of us on this lovely website.

So 6 years in and she‚Äôs still pulling her stunts and getting away with it. But I‚Äôve come to accept that dad is happy for some reason and I‚Äôve found ways to see him without her. This series of events though was just too much. I‚Äôm fed up. This is the last straw for me and sisters.

Dad was helping a friend do some work on a roof and he fell. The scaffolding broke underneath him and he fell two stories. An ambulance was called and the friend went with him to hospital. For some reason the first person he called was Big Peach. She‚Äôs been trouble ever since. He apparently feels awful, both for the accident and the drama our family is still experiencing. 

We didn‚Äôt have much information for the first couple of days. Big peach kept as much from us as she could. She only contacted my youngest sister about what happened, completely down playing everything. Sister explained that Big Peach had told her that dad had broken his shoulder after a fall but it wasn‚Äôt serious. Nothing we can do, don‚Äôt bother coming to the hospital also she has his phone so don‚Äôt bother calling him and tell OP that he won‚Äôt be home. I live with him but my sisters do not.

Little sister was really alarmed at that last point. She kept messaging about when will dad get his phone back and for the number for the ward dad was staying at in the hospital. Big peach refused to give her any of it. Kept telling her he‚Äôs fine, he‚Äôll be home by Monday. Little sister had to make a WhatsApp group with me and middle sister so all of us could try to get something out of her. 

Big Peach couldn‚Äôt keep it up in front of a crowd and eventually gave the name of the hospital and what ward he was in. Oh yeah, he‚Äôs probably getting emergency surgery because he broke a bit more than his shoulder.

He went up on Saturday, we only got this information on Monday. If we weren‚Äôt panicking before we definitively were now. We arranged for the three of us to go up on Tuesday to see him, while Big Peach kept messaging us. Trying to say how many of us can see him, trying to control when we‚Äôre going because she‚Äôs going at this certain time so we can‚Äôt go then. And again with the lies. 

She insisted she tried calling little sister on Saturday night but little sister has no missed calls from that time. She apparently tried coming to the house the same night to get some things but I had the door bolted so she couldn‚Äôt get in and Saint Big Peach didn‚Äôt want to wake me. It was bolted, it‚Äôs something I always do before bed when I‚Äôm home alone. Except I was awake for most of the night with worry and I never heard a car or anything from the door, my bedroom is opposite the front door. Also the dog goes bananas when she hears cars outside, as dogs do, and she was quiet all night. But Big Peach was totally there apparently. 

Then there was my grandparents. I called them to see how they were before we left on Tuesday and guess what? No one had told them. Big peach had gone in person that morning to tell them, all tears and needing them to comfort her. She told us on Saturday that granny and Grandda knew and weren‚Äôt going to bother coming up because he only broke his shoulder so we shouldn‚Äôt bother either. More lies.

Anyway, I found this out on the phone with them on Tuesday. Naturally they‚Äôre pissed and on their way up at the same time as us since they only just found out. Grandda explained that he had actually called Big Peach on Saturday. Just a casual call, asking how are things, what are they up do, etc. She told them that they were at home, watching tv. She told him that she didn‚Äôt want to worry them, they deserved to be told in person because isn‚Äôt she so good like that and she gave the impression that we already knew what was going on. They were angry that none of us thought to tell them but I explained that Big Peach told us they did know and that we only found out the full story the night before after her insisting on us not coming to visit him. I said we‚Äôd meet them at the hospital and share everything we knew so far. 

We got to the hospital and see dad is way more beat up than we imagined. His head‚Äôs cut up, he has a black eye, he could barely move though the pain he was in. No exaggeration, he looked dead when we walked in. I brought a bag of things for him from home and sisters brought food and drink. All of it was useless to him in that state. He couldn‚Äôt read books, eat, he could barely drink on his own. It was scary to see. He‚Äôs fallen off roofs and hurt himself before but he‚Äôs never been left like this.

The responders and the friend he was helping thought he was dead after the fall or was going to die in the ambulance because he was unconscious for ages. When we finally got talking to him he told us the story to us and we realised how little he knew of what was going on. He just knew he was in hospital and had to get surgery to fix him. He didn‚Äôt know Big Peach had his phone, that fact seemed to really alarm him actually. He didn‚Äôt know his family were left in the dark until that morning. He wasn‚Äôt even sure why Big Peach was handling everything. He has me as his emergency contact, not her. That wee fact made us all even more on edge. 

When my grandparents arrived they had time to cool down and they just wanted to see my dad. There was a rule for how many visitors could be by the bed so I swapped with my grandmother since she was most anxious to talk to him. In the hallway, my grandda begged me not be angry with Big Peach. He says that while she had been very stupid this entire time, she does make my dad happy and to please let it go for his sake. Him and my granny hold no love for her either but they still try for the sake of peace. I made no promises and even told him that I can‚Äôt forgive her this but I would try not to start fights with her because there‚Äôs enough going on already. 

It was a quiet visit all and all. That visit was anyway. 

Anytime one of us tried to visit after that, no matter the time of day, Big Peach was there. Pissed. At the fact that someone other than her was visiting him in the hospital. We got the impression that she was trying to be the loving, doting girlfriend but didn‚Äôt like the fact that there are other loved ones that were ready and willing to help too. Like it ruined her fantasy. She wanted to be the one to help him and no one else.

My middle sister hypothesised some form of  M√ºnchausen syndrome. She‚Äôs lied about studying to be a nurse for years and a couple of years back she did the same thing to her mother when she needed aid after she got her hip replaced. That didn‚Äôt last a week though. Big peach got fed up with the fact that the poor woman needed food brought to her in bed, needed help getting to the toilet, you know things that someone who‚Äôs struggling to stand or walk would need help with. She sent her mother off to live with her sister because she ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt stand being treated like a servant‚Äù 

I‚Äôm honestly not sure what she was expecting. For bells to ring and for her to get her wings? For crowds to sing her praises? Be declared a saint above saints?

I don‚Äôt agree with the M√ºnchausen syndrome idea but I do agree that all this nonsense is about attention. 

I just want to say, thank god/s for the nurses. They took good care of my dad for us and I‚Äôm very grateful for them. I brought them boxes of cookies the last couple of times I was able to visit. Don‚Äôt know if it was appropriate but they seemed thankful. 

Though the last I visited before my dad came home Big peach tried to cause drama with them too. I got there a bit before visiting time but the nurses were happy to let see my dad since I was alone. I was there for I think half an hour before Big Peach showed. I had braced myself to endure her for the full visit but after five minutes she announced she needed the toilet and walked off. She back was after a minute saying she couldn‚Äôt find it. A few seconds later a very tired nurse comes over and asks me to put on a mask or leave. While yes I wasn‚Äôt wearing one neither was anyone else. Not the other visitors, not the nurses. Only Big Peach was wearing one. 

Of course I apologised and was happy to put on the one I kept in my handbag but even dad commented on how weird it was they only asked me after I had alright being there for a while. Big Peach was saying nothing and stared at me. Dad didn‚Äôt catch on but it was obvious that she had an excused herself to complain to the nurse about my bare face. F**** her. 

While dad was in hospital my sisters and I spent all week cleaning the house, his room and getting ready for him coming home. I even replaced the broken toilet seat and fixed the damaged wall in the bathroom. Middle sister actually went all out and got new bedsheets, pillows and a duvet because the old ones were filthy beyond help. Middle sister kept raging at the amount of pink hair she was cleaning up. Big Peach sheds worse than any animal we‚Äôve ever owned. It‚Äôs disgusting. I pointed out that this is what I‚Äôm constantly dealing with but no one ever believes me. The worst part of that is that she doesn‚Äôt live with us, this is the result of just staying weekends. 

Dad actually came home way earlier than we expected. He‚Äôs miles better than he was the week before but still not well enough to be home. The friend who was with him when he fell was supposed to drive him since he has a jeep with loads of space for him to be comfortable. Except Big Peach got involved. If I had to guess she probably had a childish huff, stamped her foot and said ‚Äúno! I‚ÄôM driving him! He‚Äôs MY boyfriend! I don‚Äôt care what you say!‚Äù I‚Äôm joking of course. Kinda.

Big Peach walked straight up to the door and went for the spare key even though I know she saw me through the window. I open the door for her, thinking she must be here for a change of clothes for my dad, she storms in saying that he‚Äôs coming in the back and nothing else. 

I didn‚Äôt know what she was talking about so I just let her fight with the two back doors (they‚Äôre impossible to open unless you‚Äôve lived with them, old house quirks). She gets them unlocked and I prop them open after she storms back outside. She got my half dressed dad in and threw him in one of the chairs in the kitchen while I was putting the bin out since I was outside anyway. I was alarmed when I saw him and he was obviously in a lot of pain again, more than when I saw him in the hospital. I didn‚Äôt know he was coming home but I was glad the house was ready for him. Big peach clearly was not.

Fortunately all dad wanted was a decent cup of coffee after a week of hospital food. I happily obliged and sat with him. Meanwhile Big Peach was stomping about the house trying to find things that are wrong and getting more annoyed that nothing is.

She‚Äôs bringing bags into the house. Through the front door for some reason even though she‚Äôs parked by the back. We have a strict keep doors closed or dog closed in room because we are next to a very busy road. Big Peach has ignored this rule in past and only stopped after I threatened to hold her head under the wheel of a bus if something happened to my dog because she was lazy/stupid. She apparently forgot this rule while bringing stuff into the house so I had to rush to close the dog in before she got out.

I thought this would be the stuff dad had in the hospital and his medication but there were so many bags. Then I realised. She‚Äôs moving herself in. All those shopping bag were filled with HER stuff and little to nothing of dads. Dad has not even given her a key to the house and he looked utterly miserable at the sight of her carrying all that stuff in. He definitely wants her to go home and she‚Äôs clearly doing whatever the frigg she wants.

Since dad was settled in the kitchen and wanted to wait before trying to go to bed. He asked me to turn the kitchen tv in so he could see it and leave the him with the remote because he didn‚Äôt feel like talking. I instructed (maybe threatened) big peach to leave dad where he is and to call for me when he was ready to go upstairs. I retreated to my room and updated my sisters on the situation. After about an hour I heard them at the stairs, which are outside my bedroom door. I went out and Big Peach is trying to drag my dad and his crutches up the stairs. I didn‚Äôt try to help right away since the staircase is narrow and that could cause a more dangerous situation but I did watch them closely. One; to jump in if they needed help. Two; I trust Big Peach about as far as I can throw her off a cliff.

I‚Äôm glad I was watching. Dad was struggling up the stairs while Big Peach was grabbing the back of his shirt and pulling him backwards. Even I know that this not how you help someone up the stairs. My granny, (mums mum) lived with us for a wee bit before she died and all of us learned that you hold their arm gently and you put your hand on their back and support them as best as you can. Though honestly I think this should be obvious. 

The original plan my sisters and I had was to get dad upstairs to bed and give him some more time to heal before trying to get him back downstairs. His room has an en suite and we planned to use the upstairs hallway to get his exercises and crutch practice done. The idea was to minimise stress and pain for dad. I even got a little kettle for his room so he could have coffee without anyone having to go downstairs. 

Big peach didn‚Äôt agree with any of this. She forced dad to go up and down the stairs everyday when she wanted, not when he was ready. The three of us tried to talking to them about it but she insisted that it was good for him and it‚Äôs not nice to keep him upstairs. Dad was too sore to disagree with her. Fine. I couldn‚Äôt stop them but I made Donald ducks sure that I watched them every single time.  

I felt sick and a little frightened. Maybe I‚Äôve watched too many murder documentaries but I didn‚Äôt want to leave them alone in the house. 

This ended up probably saving my dad‚Äôs life. Night three she was ‚Äúhelping‚Äù him upstairs and he lost his balance and started to fall backwards because, as I said, SHE WAS PULLING ON THE BACK OF HIS SHIRT!! I rushed up the stairs as soon as I saw him start to wobble and caught him just in time. Adrenaline must‚Äôve been going through me because my dad is a lot bigger than me and I still manage to get him back up right. 

Big Peach was staring at us with wide eyes a slack jaw. I elbowed her out of the way and SAFELY got my dad back up the rest of the stairs and into bed. After which I did lecture her on how dangerous what she was doing and what the correct, comfortable and most importantly SAFE WAY to help someone up the stairs. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be mean or nasty to her but that was an extremely scary thing to see and I never wanted to happen again which probably affected my tone. 

To be fair to Big Peach, she was trying up to that point. I had only started a new job two weeks before and couldn‚Äôt take time off to help. She vacuumed the floor, did the dishes and made meals. Mostly she sat and watched tv but at least she did something. The meals she made were frozen meals that were hot on the outside yet still cold on the inside (still not sure how she did that) but I was still grateful and always made sure to thank her when she made dinner for me.

After the incident on the stairs however, she stopped all together. Just watched tv all day.

I started helping dad up and down the stairs because he did want to be in his favourite chair in the kitchen rather than in bed. I made dinner for everyone after work in the evenings, made dad coffee and lunch while cleaning the house on my days off. My middle sister works basically across the road from the house so she check on him while I was at work during the day and my youngest sister would come up on her days off and do what she could. 

But Big Peach? Nothing. She watched tv all day and didn‚Äôt speak a word to anyone. I came home from work once and dad immediately begged me to take him upstairs to the toilet. He‚Äôd been desperate for a pee for a couple hours but Big Peach ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt hear him‚Äù over the tv in the living room, which is next door to the kitchen. 

Three more days of this before she packed her things and went home. Because we were all being so ungrateful to her and the fact that she took time off to help us out. Even though no one asked her to do anything. 

Seriously, apart from the stairs things, she was actually being helpful in other ways like the cooking and cleaning. I never forbade from doing anything when I talked to her about the stair thing but she acted like I did. I didn‚Äôt even say that she couldn‚Äôt help dad up the stairs, just that she had to do it the right way so he wouldn‚Äôt fall. I never said a thing when she didn‚Äôt tell us about dad going to hospital, when she tried to keep us from visiting, when she told so many lies to a lot of people, when she kept his phone so we couldn‚Äôt contact him, when she checked him out early so she could be the one to drive him home, when she moved herself in and took over my house. Seriously, I never said a word to her. Because everyone, including my dad, had begged me and my sisters not to. To keep the peace and let her have her way because too much was going on already. But one talking about stair safety was out of line and made her storm out? 

My sisters and I took on more to make meals and get dad to the toilet while keeping the house. Which was the plan from the start but with Big Peachs interference we all had to scramble to rearrange our schedules with work and partners back to what to what we had planned before on very short notice. That wasn‚Äôt fun.

Big Peach stayed away for about 2 weeks before going back to her routine of coming over for the weekends for take away. She was icy to my dad and did not acknowledge me at all, which honestly suits me just fine but dad didn‚Äôt like it. Granny and Grandda visited when they could but my granny‚Äôs health isn‚Äôt great either and they can‚Äôt leave the house as often anymore. 
 
Dad‚Äôs recovery was slow and painful, the painkillers did very little for him. He actually had to change doctors, get different medication and try a new physiotherapy before anything worked for him. All the while, Big Peach was giving him grieve for how SHE was treated! I cannot comprehend this woman at all! 

Even a year later, I keep thinking about what if he had died? How long would Big Peach have kept us in the dark? How much would she have tried to highjack and control then? It scares me.

I wrote most of this while most of it was still happening but life got in the way I never ended posting but I‚Äôve decided to now because it happened again last week. 

Dad had an accident in work which gave him a concussion. And again some idiot from his work went into his phone and called his girlfriend instead of getting the information for his emergency contact that he listed (aka me).

He was unconscious for a few minutes but they still sent him to the hospital after he came around. I honestly don‚Äôt know what happened there because Big Peach at some point convinced him to message me saying he was working late. So as not to worry me apparently. And this time not a word to my sisters. Dad sometimes works late when they have a big project going on so I honestly didn‚Äôt question it that night. 

The next morning dad and me got up at the same time and there no Big Peach anywhere. I asked how work was the day before since he got home after I went to bed. That‚Äôs when he told me that he was in hospital with a concussion. It caught me completely off guard and I freaked out when he briefly tells me what happened. Then he decides to tell me that he‚Äôs going on holiday with big peach after the weekend! 

I told he can‚Äôt fly with a concussion but he insists that he‚Äôs going because he‚Äôs already booked it and Big Peach will be angry if he cancels it. I argued with him all week on it but I did drop it after a scan at the hospital told him he was all good. I had to not give him a choice on letting me take him to the hospital, Big Peach or not Big Peach. He‚Äôs promised me that he‚Äôll keep me updated on how‚Äôs he‚Äôs doing and that if he doesn‚Äôt feel well, it‚Äôs okay because he‚Äôll have big peach to look after him. I guess the concussion made him forget the last time Big Peach ‚Äúlooked after him‚Äù. 

So, yeah. They‚Äôre away now, I at least have a quiet house for the week and I‚Äôm still paranoid about my idiot dad and his selfish, idiot girlfriend. Her general awfulness and my dad stubbornness about staying with her has broken this family more than it already was. My sisters barely talk to dad anymore, Big Peach is not welcome at either of their homes, the rest of the family has completely cut contact with him and my grandparents and I are exhausted with the constant drama with them.

And undoubtedly, there is more drama, worst drama to come. Because one of my sisters just got engaged and Big Peach is already trying to hijack the whole thing. Send help. 

Fuck you Big Peach.

I have recently become convinced that veganism is a more ethical diet than one that includes animal products. I am also trying to be more aware of other products that I consume that come from sweatshops or damage the environment. With that being said, I‚Äôm realizing how complex these systems are and how ignorant I am of the processes by which the products we consume come to be. 

I know to avoid chocolate and coffee unless it is fair trade. I know to buy clothes from thrift stores or seek out brands that promote eco-friendly production and treat their employees in an ethical manner‚Ä¶but what brands actually do this?

How do I really know that something is fair trade or ethically vegan rather than just plant-based? What brands should I look for/avoid. I went grocery shopping yesterday and was completely overwhelmed by reading ingredients lists and wondering: ‚ÄúWere animals unnecessarily/deliberately harmed in the process of getting these plant-based ingredients?‚Äù ‚ÄúWere the people who farmed and manufactured these ingredients treated/compensated in a fair manner?‚Äù

If you have brand suggestions or know of books/documentaries/articles that would help clear some of this up, I would greatly appreciate that. ",40,1738681267.0,vegan,10,0.93,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ihjk1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceHeaters101/comments/1ihjk1m/dreo_drhsh006_space_heater_review_compact_heat/,Dreo DR-HSH006 space heater review: Compact heat powerhouse or just another gadget?,"I‚Äôve had my fair share of chilly mornings, especially in a drafty home office where my coffee often cools faster than I can drink it. Enter the Dreo DR-HSH006 space heater, a compact yet mighty device that claims to tackle cold spots with ease. Having tested it for weeks, I‚Äôve uncovered its strengths and a few quirks.

**Design & Build Quality**

The heater‚Äôs gold finish gives it a sleek, modern look that blends effortlessly into any room‚Äîbe it the bedroom, office, or living room. At just over 11 inches tall and weighing a little over 3 pounds, it‚Äôs incredibly portable. Moving it around the house is as easy as carrying your laptop. The tower design is not only space-efficient but also adds a touch of class compared to bulkier models. Despite its compact size, the build feels sturdy, and the materials seem durable. However, I did notice that the power cord could be slightly longer, which sometimes limits placement options.

**Heating Performance**

This little heater packs a surprising punch. With its 1500W PTC ceramic heating element, it warms up my 200 sq. ft. office in under 10 minutes. The heat output is consistent, and the thermostat does a fantastic job of maintaining the desired temperature. I love the adjustable range from 41¬∞F to 95¬∞F, allowing me to fine-tune the heat to my liking. That said, I did notice that, even at lower settings, the air coming out feels quite hot. This could be a bit much for those sensitive to intense heat.

[Check Dreo DR-HSH006 price on Amazon here.](https://heatad.com/product-reviews/dreo-space-heater-review-model-2024-b0c6fckqml/)

**Ease of Use**

Navigating the controls is simple, thanks to the digital display. The remote control is a lifesaver‚Äîespecially when I‚Äôm tucked under a blanket and don‚Äôt want to get up. Features like the 12-hour timer, child lock, and memory function add convenience. Adjusting the fan speed or activating ECO mode is straightforward, though I admit I initially had to glance at the manual to grasp all the options. One minor gripe? The remote emits a ‚Äúclick‚Äù sound when buttons are pressed, but luckily, there‚Äôs a mute option.

**Noise Level**

This heater is impressively quiet. The brushless DC motor and winglet fan design keep noise levels at a whispery 34 dB. It‚Äôs unobtrusive enough to use while working, watching TV, or even sleeping. My toddler, who is a light sleeper, didn‚Äôt stir once, even with the heater running nearby.

**Safety Features**

Safety is where the Dreo DR-HSH006 shines. The tip-over protection is reliable, and the overheat protection gives me peace of mind, particularly with kids and pets around. The flame-retardant materials are another reassuring touch. I‚Äôve accidentally nudged it a few times, and its sturdy design handled it without issue.

**Energy Efficiency**

The ECO mode is a game-changer for energy savings. It dynamically adjusts the power output based on the room temperature, ensuring I don‚Äôt waste electricity. While my energy bill hasn‚Äôt spiked noticeably, I‚Äôd recommend keeping an eye on usage during prolonged operation.

**Pros**

* Compact and portable design with a modern aesthetic.
* Heats up quickly and effectively maintains a consistent temperature.
* Extremely quiet operation, ideal for bedrooms or offices.
* Safety features like tip-over protection and overheat shut-off.
* Convenient remote control and wide range of settings.

**Cons**

* Cord length could be longer, limiting placement flexibility.
* Air feels hot even at lower temperature settings.
* Does not oscillate, which could improve heat distribution.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to the Lasko Ceramic Tower Heater, the Dreo DR-HSH006 is quieter and offers more precise temperature control. While the Lasko model boasts oscillation, it lacks the advanced safety features found in the Dreo. Another contender, the Vornado AVH10, offers similar performance but is bulkier and noisier in operation. The Dreo‚Äôs compact size and quiet functionality make it a standout option for small spaces.

That said, the Dyson Hot+Cool adds a premium feel with its bladeless design and oscillation, but at a significantly higher price point, it‚Äôs not as budget-friendly as the Dreo.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Though it‚Äôs not the cheapest space heater on the market, the Dreo DR-HSH006 offers a solid balance of performance, safety, and convenience. Its advanced features and reliable heating make it worth the investment, especially if you value quiet operation and energy efficiency. Some competitors may be less expensive, but they often sacrifice features or build quality.

In my daily use, this heater has proven itself to be an indispensable companion during cold mornings and frosty evenings. Whether I‚Äôm working in my office or relaxing in the living room, its performance has been consistently impressive.

For example, imagine doing a¬†cheating roleplay¬†with characters from¬†Khabhi Khushi Khabhi Gham. The slutty Pooh (Kareena Kapoor) constantly pushing her limits, always small satin robes or sheer robes and nothing else, the ends of the robe stopping at her mid-thigh, the loosely tied belt the only thing protecting her from flashing. Even though her exposed waist and cleavage told a story of their own, her nipples barely hidden and did slip out every few seconds.

Or Andhadhun, When Simi had to test if Akash was really blind she came to his house to investigate and while he was making coffee, she pulled out her massive breasts in the kitchen to see what visible reaction he would have or maybe down in his pants?

or how about a in-universe sequel to Humraaz?

Following the steps of other successful choreographers before him (Farah Khan, Prabhu Deva, Ganesh Acharya, etc) - now Omi has plans to turn into a director and take the responsibility for an entire film.

Raj Singhania (41) has occasionally financed a few films done by his friends. So he is known in the producers-directors circle. One of Omi‚Äôs acquaintances helps in setting up a meeting between Omi and Raj. The men meet.

Omi tells Raj, that he wants to make a movie about a married woman, without her knowledge. The woman will be someone who has a dancing background, but has been away from the dancing world for years. Raj is intrigued by the idea, and decides to fund this movie. And asks him, whom Omi wanna cast in the movie.

Omi drops a bomb, and shows Raj a short film. It‚Äôs shot with hidden camera, and features Priya (36) - Raj‚Äôs wife. It‚Äôs a film where Priya is dancing in a wedding baraat, and bumps into Omi. The two dance happily. Raj is pretty impressed with the way, Omi has used the camera, edit and music. And also, he likes the idea of his wife returning to something dance/entertainment related field. He gives green signal.

Omi and his brother Karan had a ten year age gap, so after their parents death - Karan had practically been like a parent to him. Omi as a ten year old, was pretty fond of Priya (who back then, was his Bhaiya‚Äôs girlfriend). Omi used to constantly day dream about living a perfect life with Karan and Priya. Until one day - everything was over!

As he grew up in this harsh world, he found what had happened to his brother. And how Priya was now living a luxurious life. He would often feel his brother inside his mind, and would want to take Priya for himself. In his head, that would unite Priya and Karan. He started learning to dance, his brother‚Äôs old videos and memories helped him a lot. And the hatred for Priya and Raj just fuelled his passion.

Meanwhile Raj Singhania is going through a crisis. He has been not able to get his rod hard for any woman since years now. He loves his wife truly, and he knows that she loves him too. But the lack of sex is eating him up. There was no excitement or color in his life. Until Omi walked into his office with that short film‚Ä¶

When Raj saw Omi (a young guy) dancing with his wife. He felt a current flowing through his body. He felt hard for the first time in years.

(Besides my pills),"As the title says I have problems sleeping and im actually insomniac and Ive been taking Zoplicone + benzos + opioids in order to sleep. But since a few years back I discovered the more caffeine I take the faster I fall asleep. Example:

- I take two cups of coffee in the morning I need to go to sleep a couple of hours. 
- If I can't get to nap I grab a Monster, drink the whole thing + two 4 mg of alprazolam and bam, 3 or 4 hours of sleep. Whereas if I dont take any caffeine I don't sleep.
- every time I go to sleep I bring three cans of Cocacola to take them in the middle of the night to keep sleeping, otherwise I wake up and start doing things.

I'm taking 300 mg of Wellbutrin everyday.

Today, we'll establish a shared understanding as the foundation for future discussions: What do Verification and Validation mean? And why is it often challenging to clearly distinguish between the two terms?**  
  
To set the stage, let's begin with a brief recap from the article¬†[V+V - Quick Tips 2022](https://www.metecon.de/en/news/verifikation-validierung-quick-tips-2022/u/1108/):

**Understanding the Importance of Verification and Validation**

[Verification and Validation (V&V)](https://www.metecon.de/en/leistungen/verifikation-validierung/)¬†are among the most crucial quality management and assurance tools. Quality here refers to the degree to which requirements‚Äîbe they guidelines, expectations, or agreements, both external and internal‚Äîare met.

So, what significance do Verification and Validation hold for you as a medical device manufacturer? Let's examine how frequently these terms appear in key regulatory documents: The more often a term is mentioned, the more important it is, providing insights into the areas these regulations emphasize.

**Frequency of Terms in Key Regulatory Documents**  
  
Table 1: Frequency of Terms

||
||
|**Terms**|**MDR / 175 pages**|**ISO 13485 / 85 pages**|
|Medical Device|203|155|
|Quality|130|262|
|Risk\*|231|47|
|Validation\*|33|62|
|Verification\*|8|64|

Given the ""New Approach,"" it's no surprise that the Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745 focuses heavily on risk management. Similarly, quality is the primary focus of the standard for quality management systems (DIN EN ISO 13485:2016). Both documents also place significant emphasis on the validation of medical devices, with DIN EN ISO 13485:2016 particularly stressing verification.

In summary, Verification and Validation (V&V) are mentioned 167 times in total. This makes it clear that V&V are deeply embedded in the regulatory and normative requirements of the medical device industry. Without thoroughly addressing each mention, it's impossible to produce documentation that meets EU certification or approval standards. A first step towards such documentation is a systematic review of all references to V&V, to develop optimal solutions or strategies.

Before delving deeper into potential solutions in my next article, it is crucial to establish a common understanding of the methods of Verification and Validation. So, let's first define what it means to verify and validate. After all, these are actions that must be performed to achieve a satisfactory outcome.

# The Definition of Verification

The verb¬†*""to verify""*¬†comes from the two Latin words¬†*verus*¬†(true, correct) and¬†*facere*¬†(to make); in Italian,¬†*verificare*¬†also means¬†*""to check.""*

At Metecon, we interpret¬†*""verification""*¬†as follows: to demonstrate through testing and documentation that a given situation meets the agreed-upon requirements.¬†**ISO 9001:2015**¬†**defines verification**¬†as ""confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence, that specified requirements have been fulfilled.""

**Verification**¬†refers to the¬†**process of verifying**, which usually refers to all verifications associated with a product, including a final confirmation.  
In Italian, which is still closely aligned with its Latin roots, there is no distinction between verification and validation‚Äîboth are referred to as¬†*verifica*.

Additional precise definitions include:

* **To Check:**¬†""to determine the extent to which a test object meets a requirement"" (ISO 1319).
* **Objective evidence:**¬†""data supporting the existence or truth of something"" (ISO 9000:2015).
* **Requirement:**¬†""a need or expectation that is stated, generally implied, or mandatory"" (ISO 9000:2015).

The tasks involved in verification are checking and documenting, possibly including recording data. For instance, if the specified requirement is:

**""A robot should have the degree of freedom to rotate around its axis,""**,

A test can determine whether this requirement is met. However, to prove compliance, objective evidence is needed. This could be a test protocol detailed enough to ensure that the test can be repeated with the same result. A¬†**test protocol**, or an¬†**inspection protocol**¬†during inspections, is necessary as objective evidence for every requirement.

Many requirements are set out in standards, which often also specify the tests and inspections needed to verify these requirements. If a product passes all tests against a standard and the tests and inspections are documented, the product can be said to be¬†**verified against the standard**.

# Can Every Requirement Be Verified?

No! If there are no clear acceptance criteria for a requirement, it cannot be verified, as it is unclear how the requirement can be definitively met. This is the case in our example above‚Äîwhat exactly does ""rotation around its axis"" mean? It may lack a drawing or specific acceptance criteria, such as ""rotation by +/- 361¬∞ with an accuracy of +/- 0.5¬∞"" or ""free rotation without limitation in both directions.""

Some requirements are fundamentally unverifiable because current technology does not allow it:

Example from medical technology:  
**Is a product sterile in its packaging?**  
Solution: Validation of a sterilization process.

Example from a laboratory:  
**Is the transformer potted in a way that leaves no air pockets?**  
Solution: Validation of a vacuum potting process.

Here, it becomes clear that¬†**validation is applied when verification is not possible**.

Verification can also fail:  
**What should be done if the robot cannot rotate around its axis?**  
Correct: The specification has not been met, and there is no approval for the design result.  
Incorrect: The requirement to rotate around the axis is removed. :-)

# The Definition of Validation

The verb¬†*""to validate""*¬†is derived from the Latin¬†*valere,*¬†meaning¬†*""to be worth*,¬†*to have value""*; in Italian,¬†*convalidare*¬†means ""*to declare valid*,¬†*to authenticate*,"" and¬†*valevole*¬†means¬†*""valid.""*

At Metecon, we interpret ""validation"" as follows: to declare a given situation valid, based on justified reasoning, so that it is accepted by third parties. ISO 9001:2015 defines¬†**validation**¬†as:  
""Confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence, that the requirements for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled.""

# Definition of Validation According to ISO 9001:2015 ‚Äì A Source of Confusion

Here, we must discuss the definition of validation in ISO 9001:2015. Why? Because the definition of validation is unfortunately poorly chosen and, in practice, tends to cause confusion rather than clarification. Let‚Äôs examine this by comparing the definitions of verification and validation, keeping in mind that ISO 9001 is not the management system standard for medical devices. Unfortunately, ISO 13485 for medical device manufacturers does not provide definitions here.

As we see in the following table, ISO 9001:2015 attempted to structure the definitions of verification and validation similarly. Unfortunately, by aligning the definitions under the term ""confirmation,"" the true nature of validation has been lost, and validation is now presented as a type of verification. This suggests that the standards committee could not reach a consensus on the term validation.

The etymology and meaning of the verbs ""to verify"" and ""to validate"" were completely overlooked here‚Äîresulting in even more confusion around the concept of validation. The definition of validation can now be interpreted either correctly or incorrectly.

An¬†**incorrect interpretation of validation**¬†is to consider it a special form of verification. The¬†**correct interpretation of validation**¬†is a justified assessment of how well a situation meets a requirement.

The definition of validation in ISO 9001:2015 sometimes leads to functional tests of a device being interpreted as the device's validation, even though it's unclear whether the user can achieve the intended purpose with the device.

Validation: What Must Be Done to Meet the Requirement?

Returning to the definition of validation, let‚Äôs consider the following requirement:¬†**""I want a coffee that tastes good.""**

For coffee to taste good, it must first and foremost have a taste. This can be verified, as it is known which chemical substances are detected by taste receptors, and these substances can be identified through tests in the coffee. However, it is not known which combination of substances universally constitutes good-tasting coffee. Therefore, we cannot verify the statement ""The coffee tastes good!"" But can we still claim that the coffee tastes good and thereby fulfill the requirement ""The coffee tastes good""? What needs to be done?

This question leads directly to the answer:¬†**What must be done**¬†to convince the recipient of the coffee that it tastes good before they have personally tasted it?  
The process requires analysis, testing, documentation, evaluation, and assessment. In essence, it must be validated.  
During validation, objective evidence is gathered to support the evaluation and assessment, forming the basis for justification. Such evidence might include study results on taste perception or chemical analyses confirming that the ingredients are comparable to those of previously validated good-tasting coffee.

A crucial aspect of validation is that¬†**third parties must be able to accept the validity of a statement**. Therefore, it may be necessary to document the authority, role, competence, and experience of the person conducting the validation to achieve acceptance of the documented evaluation and assessment. After all, can just anyone sign off on an acceptable clinical evaluation?

To validate means to:

* Gather objective evidence,
* Analyze and evaluate this evidence in relation to a specific matter,
* Assess and declare it valid based on proven competence and experience.

**The coffee tastes good! ‚Äì according to the present validation.**",1,1738680534.0,u_Metecon_17,0,1.0,False

So here is what I'm looking for:

* Fits a left counter placement, up against a wall / fridge divider, located partially under a top cabinet. So the controls would ideally be front facing, and/or to the front right side of the coffee maker.
* While I see the appeal of stainless steel carafe, I feel like I would like to go back to glass with an under heating element. I could be convinced otherwise. Visually it's just nice to see the coffee level remaining and how clean the craft is.
* Does not have to have a built in grinder but it would be nice.
* Top FRONT fill for water. I would prefer to not have to slide out the machine every time I want to add water and top it off.
* Removable back water tank. While I can descale my current one, it would be nice to separate the tank and give it some elbow grease one in a while.
* Supports reusable baskets. Minor need here, but it's all fun and games until you need a coffee filter and don't have one.
* Not wider than my current coffee makers footprint (9.0""?)

I had my gallbladder removed after suddenly developing pain and jaundice in 2021. Since then I have had chronic, debilitating diarrhoea which has greatly reduced my quality of life and impacted on my well being. After trying to manage for three years I went to see my GP last summer who referred me to a specialist as my bloods showed my liver function was poor, I was anaemic and lots of other issues. She referred me for a colonoscopy which was clear but the gastro consultant felt my symptoms may be due to bile acid malabsorption. I had a SecHAT scan end of December and received a letter today diagnosing me with severe bile acid malabsorption. 

I am waiting to see my GP as they have been asked to prescribe Colestryamine. I cannot explain how relieved I am that it looks like I can finally get some treatment and have a normal life again. I can go shopping, go for lunch or have a coffee without getting severe urgent diarrhoea. 

People are quick to say that diarrhoea after having your gallbladder removed is normal and that you should try to control it through diet and reducing your fat intake.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Tbilisi, the stunning capital of Georgia, is a city where echoes of history can be seen and felt in every corner. Among these echoes is the distinctive architectural style that arose during the Soviet period. Soviet architecture in Tbilisi has left an undeniable mark on the urban landscape, acting as a bridge between the past and the present. This architectural presence not only reflects the political climate of the time but also blends the local culture with the dominant Soviet aesthetic.

The Soviet era brought about significant changes to the urban fabric of Tbilisi. The introduction of modernist architectural principles was a response to the industrialization sweeping through the country. Structures built during this period often embraced functionality over embellishment. These buildings stand as testaments to the ambition of a regime that aimed to create a new social order, while also intertwining with Georgian traditions.

One observes a variety of architectural styles as one walks through the streets of Tbilisi. The following elements showcase the impact of Soviet architecture in the city:

- **Brutalism:** This style is characterized by its rugged, raw concrete structures. Buildings such as the Tbilisi Concert Hall and the Ministry of Highways exemplify the monumental nature of brutalism, highlighting strength and functionality.
- **Constructivism:** This style emerged with an emphasis on social purpose. The House of Justice, with its dynamic forms, represents this ethos, providing public services in an inviting environment.
- **Neo-Gothic Revival:** Surprisingly, some Soviet-era structures drew inspiration from neo-Gothic architecture, infusing Western styles into Soviet ideology. The Tbilisi State University building is a vivid example, featuring ornate details not typically associated with socialist architecture.

Walking through the city, you may notice that many of these structures were often built with community in mind. The complexes provide spaces where people can gather, uphold traditions, and forge new memories. Public spaces were carefully designed to foster interactions among residents, reflecting the socialist ideal of collective living.

However, not all inhabitants of Tbilisi have embraced the legacy of Soviet architecture. For many, these structures symbolize a painful past, representing oppression and conformity. The diverse reactions to this architectural heritage can be seen in the debates surrounding preservation versus modernization. Some argue that the Soviet buildings should be preserved as a means of honoring history, while others view them as relics that hold back Tbilisi's growth and identity.

The architectural landscape of Tbilisi continues to evolve, creating a dynamic juxtaposition of old and new. Contemporary designs often integrate modern aesthetics while still accounting for the city's historical context. The blend of Soviet-era structures with newly constructed buildings provides a unique opportunity for urban planners and architects to create a harmonious dialogue between the past and the present.

As you stroll through the streets of Tbilisi, take a moment to appreciate the intricate details that each building offers. Look for the fascinating fusion of styles as Georgian warmth intermingles with Soviet starkness. Understanding the significance of this architectural legacy allows you to engage more deeply with the city‚Äôs culture and history.

The impact of Soviet architecture on Tbilisi‚Äôs urban landscape is profound. It offers insights into a bygone era while contributing to the city's unique character. Whether you find beauty or unease in the concrete facades, there‚Äôs no denying that they are part of Tbilisi‚Äôs identity, making it a fascinating destination for both locals and tourists alike.

Embrace the charm of Tbilisi as you explore its architectural wonders. Each building tells a story, inviting you to reflect on how history shapes modern experiences. Remember, architecture is not merely about the buildings; it‚Äôs about the lives lived within and around them.

Exploring the Cultural Significance of Soviet-Era Buildings in Georgia
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the heart of Georgia, Soviet-era buildings stand as silent witnesses to a complex history. These architectural marvels tell stories of resilience, ideology, and a unique blend of cultural influences. Walking through Tbilisi, the capital, or exploring other Georgian cities, you will find structures that reveal much about the past and its enduring impact on the present.

One striking aspect of Soviet architecture is its eclectic nature. It combines elements from traditional Georgian styles with Brutalist and Constructivist designs. As you wander through streets like Rustaveli Avenue, you may spot the ornate details of the Georgian National Museum alongside the stark, imposing forms of Soviet buildings. This mix creates a visual narrative that reflects Georgia's journey from tradition to modernity.

### Architectural Styles and Their Impact

The Soviet epoch significantly influenced the architectural landscape of Georgia. Buildings constructed during this period are characterized by several distinct styles:

- **Brutalism:** This style is known for its rugged, raw concrete structures that often dominate cityscapes. An example in Tbilisi is the Academy of Sciences, showcasing the pure, unadorned forms typical of this approach.
- **Constructivism:** Emerging in the early 20th century, these structures emphasize functionality and social purpose. The Tbilisi Railway Station, with its geometric shapes and practical design, exemplifies this style.
- **Socialist Realism:** This style promotes an idealized vision of society. Buildings often feature grandiose designs aimed at inspiring the public. The Georgian State Philharmonic is a beautiful representation of this ideology.

As you explore these styles, it‚Äôs essential to recognize their cultural significance. Each building narrates a chapter in Georgia‚Äôs architectural evolution and reflects the societal aspirations of the time.

### Symbol of Identity and Resilience

Soviet-era architecture in Georgia also symbolizes a strong national identity. Despite the challenges during this period, many buildings reflect the spirit of the Georgian people. For instance, the Heroes Square monument, prominently located in the city, symbolizes courage and has become a gathering place for cultural events. Such structures not only commemorate historical events but also serve as points of pride for locals.

‚Äã -Plan Your Visit to Georgia Here--&gt;https://travels-101.com/explore-everything-georgia-has-to-offer  
Moreover, the adaptation of these buildings over the years illustrates the resilience of Georgian culture. Many former government institutions have transformed into vibrant spaces. Caf√©s, galleries, and cultural centers now occupy former Soviet buildings, breathing new life into spaces once defined by political power. You might find a cozy coffee shop nestled in a Brutalist structure, showcasing how history can coexist with contemporary culture.

### The Role of Preservation Efforts

As Georgian society continues to evolve, preserving these architectural works becomes increasingly important. Local communities and cultural organizations are stepping up to protect their architectural heritage while ensuring it serves modern needs. The preservation helps maintain a connection to the past while inviting future generations to engage with history.

Several initiatives focus on restoring these iconic buildings. Collaborating with architects and historians, these projects aim to maintain architectural integrity while introducing sustainable practices. This commitment ensures that Soviet-era buildings continue to hold their cultural significance within the urban fabric of Georgia.

The open shelf below is a nice touch for books or decorative storage bins. Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget the cable management system‚Äîtwo desktop grommet holes make it super easy to keep cords under control. My desk finally doesn‚Äôt look like a spaghetti monster of charging cables anymore.

Assembly is where things get real. If DIY projects make you break out in hives, brace yourself. The instructions are clear, but the process is long, taking me about four hours with a screwdriver and hammer. Some parts weren‚Äôt labeled, which led to me staring at the manual like it was an ancient treasure map. A few pieces were heavy and awkward to handle alone, especially the desktop, so I‚Äôd recommend having a second person help out. On the bright side, all parts fit together seamlessly, and the final product didn‚Äôt have any wobbly legs or uneven surfaces.

**Pros**

* Spacious workspace with excellent storage options.
* Aesthetic design with soft white and oak accents.
* Durable material that withstands everyday use.
* Full-extension drawers for easy access to items.
* Effective cable management keeps cords organized.

**Cons**

* Assembly is time-consuming and requires patience.
* Heavyweight makes it challenging to move solo.
* Some parts weren‚Äôt labeled, adding to the setup difficulty.
* Raw wood base of the legs could scratch floors; sliders are advised.
* Slight plywood smell initially, though it fades over time.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to other L-shaped desks, like the Walker Edison Modern L-Shaped Desk or the Monarch Specialties Corner Desk, the Sauder Cottage Road stands out for its farmhouse aesthetic and storage features. Both competitors have sleek designs but fall short when it comes to drawer space or dedicated cable management. On the flip side, the Walker Edison desk is lighter and easier to move, while the Monarch Specialties desk offers a tempered glass top for a more contemporary look. Sauder‚Äôs desk excels in sturdy build quality and charm, though you pay for it with a more involved assembly process.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

In terms of value, I‚Äôd say the Sauder Cottage Road desk is fairly priced for what it offers. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest option out there, the combination of style, durability, and functionality makes it worth the investment. It‚Äôs ideal for someone who wants a desk that‚Äôs both practical and visually pleasing. Just make sure you‚Äôre ready to commit some time and effort to the assembly process, as this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúset it up in five minutes‚Äù kind of deal.

One of the desk‚Äôs standout features is its ability to blend into various room styles. Whether your decor leans toward coastal cottage, shabby chic, or modern farmhouse, this desk complements it beautifully. The drawers glide smoothly on ball-bearing mechanisms, and the safety stop feature ensures they won‚Äôt accidentally slide out too far. However, if you‚Äôre looking for something customizable or electric, this isn‚Äôt the desk for you. It‚Äôs freestanding and straightforward, which is perfect for a home office setup or study corner.

I a have done a lot of general plumbing repairs and did all the work for our kitchen renovation last year. But since this is a new add-on and not rip/replace I am seeking some guidance on some of the codes I need to be mindful of. We live in NC, if that matters. Can someone point me to or tell me what would be needed to add a small sink with the drain connected inside the wall over a crawl space?  How far off the floor should the drain out be?  Is there a requirement for AAV or can I tie into an existing drain line under the house that is supplied by a main vent elsewhere?  Is there a min/max pipe size diameter for such a sink?  The nearest connection to tie into an existing drain system under the house is about 15 feet way but is toward the opposite end of the house from where all the waste flows out.  That connection is for a utility sink in the garage or do I need to go the opposite direction and tie into a bigger main line out? if so, any requirements I need to be mindful of like how many drains are connected to it?  Any help appreciated.  Happy to read a lot of reference material like I did last year and I passed all the necessary inspections the 1st time round.

Thanks!

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Home and kitchen appliances play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and convenience of our daily routines. From the basic necessities to the latest innovations, these devices have transformed the way we cook, clean, and manage our households. Investing in high-quality home and kitchen appliances not only saves time but also ensures a seamless experience in meal preparation and household chores.

When considering home and kitchen appliances, it's essential to explore various categories to meet specific needs. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

- **Cooking Appliances:** Ovens, microwaves, air fryers, and stovetops are indispensable for making meal prep effortless.
- **Cleaning Appliances:** Dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, and washing machines reduce the time spent on tedious tasks, allowing for a cleaner home.
- **Refrigeration:** Refrigerators and freezers keep food fresh and safe, playing a critical role in reducing food waste.
- **Small Appliances:** Blenders, coffee makers, and toasters add convenience to daily routines, helping you create delicious meals and beverages with ease.

In recent years, technology has significantly influenced the development of home and kitchen appliances. Smart appliances, equipped with Wi-Fi connectivity and advanced monitoring systems, allow users to control devices remotely and receive notifications. This innovation is reshaping the landscape of home management, making it easier for individuals to oversee household functions.

Moreover, energy-efficient appliances are becoming increasingly popular as homeowners look to reduce their utility bills and environmental impact. Appliances that meet ENERGY STAR¬Æ ratings are designed to use less energy while still delivering optimal performance.

Ultimately, the right selection of home and kitchen appliances can elevate any living space. By prioritizing quality, efficiency, and modern features, consumers can make informed choices that will lead to a more enjoyable and manageable home environment.

Kaso recently, napag-awayan na nila 'etong matter na ito. Medj nainis na 'ata LIP niya sa pagtanggap niya ng gifts. Kasi 'yung last gift na natanggap niya, teddy bear na may hawak na note na ""mamahalin kita nang 10,000 na taon"" in Japanese. üò≠

Mayroon pang one time na siya mismo pumunta sa building nu'ng guy para lang kunin 'yung regalo niya.

Ngayon, hindi ko alam if ano stand ko about this one. Part of me says na okay lang naman talaga 'yun, as long as hindi nga naman siya napakikinabangan.
However, may thought din ako na parang hindi nga 'ata maganda tingnan if tatanggap pa ng gifts from supposed ""suitors"" or ""admirers"", lalo na't may serious commitment na.

Personally, ano stand niyo about this one?

Now recently I've been wondering about my shitty blooms. If I swirl the bloom, the bloom is fine but the brew will stall pretty quickly. If I *don't* swirl the bloom, the drawdown is much better but I will almost always get a tall bloom that won't saturate properly unless I use more than 5x coffee weight, causing the worst bed you've seen in your life. 

Now I feel like I'm going insane a little bit and making a cup each way and then comparing them might lead me to some placebo conclusions.

  
Is there a way to achieve proper blooms without causing fine migration? Or am I just going to have to spend on a proper grinder?",2,1738679112.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

I live in a shopping district in a small cheese making town in the Netherlands and everything is in walking distance. 

I got coffee from the nut roaster (‚Ç¨12.50) and cheese from our amazing cheesemonger (‚Ç¨10.95). There are also wonderful bakeries for bread and pastries, a butcher, a fishmonger, a windmill to buy flour and a fruit and veg shop which is always well stocked. There is also a market in the square on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

The biggest surprise was a shop my friend recommended when I asked her where to get milk. It's self automated so I downloaded an app to open the door and pay for what I took. I got the milk (local from the dairy in town), some mandarins cos they looked good (they were!) and some stuff for pizza, not local but organic and from Italy (‚Ç¨9.33).

It is working out to be pricier but I find I'm buying way fewer impulse purchases and it all tastes so much better. I also get to walk more which is a pain in the butt but also a good thing. And I get to support local.

Imagine a busy morning where I need my caffeine fix without fumbling through overly complicated controls ‚Äì this machine makes that happen. Sleek, modern, and functional, it‚Äôs been a joy to use. That said, there are a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design & Build Quality**

The first thing I noticed was the minimalist black design. The touchscreen interface gives it a clean, futuristic vibe, and the absence of physical buttons means there‚Äôs no dirt or grime collecting in tiny crevices. While the lightweight nature of the coffeemaker made me question its durability initially, it‚Äôs held up well so far. However, the plastic construction does make it feel less premium compared to some stainless steel models. I also appreciated the water reservoir‚Äôs side window, which made it easier to gauge water levels without peeking into the tank like a contortionist.

Want to see Cuisinart DCC-T20 14-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker‚Äôs latest price on Amazon? [Click here to find out.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/cuisinart-dcc-t20p1-review-with-asin-b084f42g2x/)

**Brewing Performance**

Let‚Äôs talk about speed and consistency. The Cuisinart DCC-T20 uses PerfecTemp technology, and as a caffeine addict, I can confirm it delivers hotter coffee than many other machines I‚Äôve owned. I‚Äôve brewed everything from a quick one-cup fix to a full 14-cup carafe for family gatherings, and the brewing time remains impressively quick. The bold setting was great for my mornings when I needed an extra kick, while my partner prefers the regular strength, which the machine handles equally well. That said, it‚Äôs worth noting that the machine can be a bit noisy during the brewing cycle, though not to an annoying degree.

**Coffee Flavor**

The flavor is where this coffeemaker shines. With its reusable gold-tone filter, I‚Äôve been able to brew coffee that‚Äôs rich and smooth, without the bitterness that some machines tend to produce. The bold brew option truly elevates the taste when using freshly ground beans. However, I did notice that if I use the gold filter alone, tiny sediments sometimes make it into the coffee. Pairing it with a paper filter solves this issue, and the results are consistently excellent.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**

Easy cleaning is a lifesaver for someone like me who often forgets to maintain appliances. The removable parts (reusable filter, carafe, and lid) make washing a breeze. However, I noticed that the ‚Äúclean‚Äù indicator light doesn‚Äôt always activate, even when the machine clearly needs descaling. This can be annoying if you rely on prompts for maintenance. To avoid any hiccups, I‚Äôve just made it a habit to run a vinegar solution every month or so.

**Pros**

* Sleek and modern touchscreen design enhances kitchen aesthetics.
* Delivers hotter coffee with customizable brew strength settings.
* Reusable filter is eco-friendly and cost-effective.
* Handles small (1-4 cup) and large (up to 14 cup) quantities efficiently.
* Easy-to-clean design, with simple access to removable parts.

**Cons**

* Lightweight plastic construction lacks a premium feel.
* ‚ÄúClean‚Äù light doesn‚Äôt always activate when needed.
* Some coffee sediment may pass through the reusable filter.
* Narrow reservoir opening requires careful pouring.
* Can be noisy during brewing.

**Comparison to Competitors**

I‚Äôve previously used the Ninja CE251 and the Hamilton Beach 49980A, both solid drip coffee makers in their own right. Compared to the Ninja, the Cuisinart DCC-T20‚Äôs touchscreen interface feels more modern and streamlined, but the Ninja‚Äôs stainless steel build gives it a sturdier edge. The Hamilton Beach model, while more budget-friendly, doesn‚Äôt match the Cuisinart‚Äôs ability to maintain optimal brewing temperatures or its customizable features. If durability is a major concern, some might lean toward the Ninja. However, for those who prioritize brewing performance and aesthetics, the Cuisinart stands out.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The Cuisinart DCC-T20 sits in the mid-to-upper range when it comes to coffee makers, and it seems worth the investment for what it delivers. While you might pay a bit more compared to basic models, the touchscreen controls, hotter brewing temps, and overall features make it a solid choice. If you‚Äôre someone who values convenience, quality coffee, and a touch of modernity in your kitchen, this is a great pick. Just don‚Äôt expect it to feel as hefty or durable as stainless steel alternatives.

**Features in Action**

The programmable settings have been a game-changer. I‚Äôve set the machine to start brewing at 6 AM, so by the time I‚Äôm out of bed, the aroma of fresh coffee fills the house. The auto-off feature is another lifesaver, especially on days when I rush out the door and completely forget to turn it off. The adjustable warming plate is a nice touch too, keeping the coffee at my preferred temperature without burning it. The bold brew setting has become my best friend for those sluggish mornings, and the 1-4 cup mode ensures I don‚Äôt waste coffee when I only need a small amount.
