**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!**

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

------------------------------------------------------------------

We've all been there – Fido staring up at you with those puppy-dog eyes as you prepare dinner, a raw chicken heart accidentally dropping onto the floor. Before you know it, it's vanished! But should you be worried? Can dogs eat raw chicken hearts? Is it a healthy snack, a potential hazard, or something in between? This seemingly simple question opens a Pandora's Box of opinions and conflicting information. Let's unpack this raw food debate, exploring the benefits, risks, and everything you need to know about feeding chicken hearts to your furry best friend. We'll delve into the nutritional value, debunk myths, and offer practical advice to help you make informed decisions about your dog's diet. So, grab a cup of coffee and settle in – we're about to embark on a culinary journey through the world of canine raw feeding!

Can Dogs Eat Raw Chicken Hearts? Exploring the Nutritional Benefits
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Before we jump into the potential risks, let's talk about the good stuff. Why are raw chicken hearts even considered as a dog food in the first place? Well, these little nuggets are nutritional powerhouses packed with essential vitamins and minerals crucial for a dog's overall health. Think of them as nature's multivitamin, specifically designed for canine carnivores.

### The Nutritional Goldmine in a Chicken Heart

Raw chicken hearts are brimming with taurine, an amino acid vital for heart health, vision, and reproduction. They're also an excellent source of protein, which fuels muscle growth and repair. Don't forget the iron, zinc, and B vitamins, all essential components of a balanced canine diet. These nutrients contribute to a healthy immune system, strong bones, and a shiny coat. Imagine it as a natural, readily available supplement tucked away in a bite-sized package.

Can Dogs Eat Raw Chicken Hearts? Unveiling the Potential Risks
--------------------------------------------------------------

Now, let’s address the elephant in the room – the risks associated with feeding raw chicken hearts. While these little morsels offer nutritional benefits, they also carry the potential for contamination. Just like any raw meat, chicken hearts can harbor bacteria like Salmonella and Campylobacter, which can cause foodborne illnesses in both dogs and humans. This is a legitimate concern, especially for puppies, senior dogs, or dogs with compromised immune systems.

### Navigating the Bacterial Battlefield

So, how do you minimize the risks? Sourcing high-quality, human-grade chicken hearts from reputable butchers is crucial. Proper handling and storage are equally important. Freezing the hearts for a period can also help reduce bacterial load. Furthermore, maintaining good hygiene in your kitchen, including washing your hands thoroughly after handling raw meat, is a must.

Raw Chicken Hearts for Dogs: A Balanced Perspective
---------------------------------------------------

Feeding raw chicken hearts, like any raw food diet for dogs, isn't a black-and-white issue. It requires careful consideration, balancing the potential benefits against the inherent risks. Let's explore the various facets of this dietary choice.

### Raw Feeding vs. Kibble: The Great Debate

Many pet owners swear by raw feeding, believing it's closer to a dog's ancestral diet. They argue that it provides superior nutrition, better digestion, and improved dental health. However, commercially produced kibble also offers a safe and convenient way to provide complete and balanced nutrition. Ultimately, the decision rests with you, in consultation with your veterinarian.

### Considering Your Dog's Individual Needs

Is your dog a puppy, a senior, or somewhere in between? Does she have any underlying health conditions? These are crucial factors to consider before incorporating raw chicken hearts into her diet. A young, healthy dog might tolerate raw food well, whereas a senior dog with a weakened immune system might be more susceptible to bacterial infections.

Preparing and Serving Raw Chicken Hearts to Your Dog
----------------------------------------------------

So, you've weighed the pros and cons and decided to give raw chicken hearts a try. What’s the best way to prepare and serve them?

### Safe Handling and Portion Control

Remember those hygiene tips we mentioned earlier? They're paramount. Wash your hands thoroughly, use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw meat, and clean up any spills immediately. As for portion control, chicken hearts should be a treat, not a meal replacement. Start with small quantities and observe your dog for any adverse reactions.

### Incorporating Chicken Hearts into a Balanced Diet

Raw chicken hearts can complement a balanced raw food diet or be given as occasional treats alongside kibble. Don't overdo it, though. Too many chicken hearts can lead to nutritional imbalances. Think of them as the cherry on top, not the whole sundae.

Can Dogs Eat Raw Chicken Hearts? Addressing Common Concerns
-----------------------------------------------------------

Let's tackle some of the most frequent questions surrounding this topic:

### What about Salmonella and other bacteria?

As discussed earlier, the risk of bacterial contamination is real. Sourcing high-quality hearts, proper handling, and freezing can significantly reduce this risk.

### Aren't bones a choking hazard?

Chicken hearts are generally considered safe for dogs to eat whole, but some owners prefer to chop them up, especially for smaller breeds. The primary concern with chicken bones is cooked bones, which can splinter. Raw bones, on the other hand, are typically soft and digestible.

### How many chicken hearts can I feed my dog?

Moderation is key! Treats, including chicken hearts, should make up no more than 10% of your dog's daily caloric intake.

Can Dogs Eat Raw Chicken Hearts? The Final Verdict
--------------------------------------------------

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to feed your dog raw chicken hearts rests solely on you. By weighing the potential benefits, understanding the risks, and following safe handling practices, you can make an informed choice that aligns with your dog's individual needs and your own comfort level. This journey into the intricacies of canine nutrition has hopefully empowered you to navigate the raw feeding debate, separating fact from fiction, and ultimately, providing the best possible care for your furry companion.

Remember, consulting with a veterinarian or a qualified canine nutritionist is invaluable, especially if you're considering switching to a raw food diet. They can offer personalized guidance based on your dog's specific health status and dietary requirements. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and seek expert advice. After all, your dog's health and well-being are priceless.

Conclusion
----------

Feeding your dog raw chicken hearts can be a beneficial addition to their diet if handled correctly. By understanding the potential risks and adhering to safe practices, you can offer your dog a nutritious treat while minimizing the chances of health complications. Remember to treat chicken hearts as a supplement or occasional treat rather than a staple, and always prioritise your dog's overall health and well-being. Always consult your veterinarian before making any significant dietary changes for your dog. They can assess your dog's individual needs and offer personalized recommendations. By being informed and proactive, you can ensure your furry friend enjoys a long, healthy, and happy life.",1,1734789660.0,DogRhino,0,1.0,False

I own several beauty salons with my husband and we both agreed that when our child is born, we will rely on the help of a nanny that we have known for years so I can continue working. Our baby boy is very happy, we the parents are also very happy and life is great overall. 

Last week my sister (35F) came by our house to drop something and she happened to come just when I was returning from work. Nothing out of the ordinary happened and I assumed everything was cool. 

Yesterday we went to our parents place to have a cup of coffee and agree on some things for the Christmas dinner and my sister started making comments that she feels so bad that my husband and son are lacking 'the proper care and attention' a wife and a mother should give to her family. She was telling this to my husband in front of me and our parents. I did not have a chance to say anything because my husband told her he and our son are not lacking anything and asked her where she got that idea from. My sister explained that last week when she came to our house and I was just returning from work, she saw how I looked, that I had make up on, my hair was done, my nails were perfect and it showed that I was very concerned about superficial things instead of being a good mother and wife. Husband said her remarks are just plain stupid since I have always been like this, this is part of my identity and if I look good and am concerned with my looks it does not mean I am not a good wife or mother. My sister continued saying that as parents who have a boy we should be concerned the example we give to him because he has to learn to appreciate women for other qualities other than looks. She even said my husband has no idea what he is talking about because he doesn't know what he is missing out yet.

I was already angry at this point so I asked her if that was the case, why did her husband leave her? She pays no attention to her looks, based on her messed up ideas she has all the qualities of a dedicated wife and mother but still her ex husband left her and willingly wanted to miss out her perfect ass. She started crying and shouting and dad kicked her out. Mom was trying to make us both apologise but dad was not having it and asked her to leave. 

Today my sister sends me a novel explaining all the reasons why I am the AH. She claims it was cruel of me to mention her ex husband leaving her when she was just worried for her brother in law and nephew. She claims I am the AH because dad kicked her out of their house yesterday and is taking my side. I have not responded to her message yet because I am still angry. I admit I may have been cruel to her but she was insulting me ao she had it comming.

I currently work as a pharmacovigilance scientist (PV) and have been with my current company since Jan 2021. The original compensation was a piece-rate salary, with senior team members routinely clocking in above 6-figures. The training for the work was long, and I didn't get my footing down until 1.5 years in, around mid 2022. I was planning to make the bigger bucks in 2023, only for HR to unexpectedly change our compensation to annual salary. I was given the same salary as when I was a trainee and didn't fight it, which was a mistake. I also had some quality issues mid 2023 and the company started hiring colleagues in India. I didn't want to rock the boat too much.

Fast-forward to this year, there has been a lot of change/turnover, and a senior member of my team became my manager. I have become a rock of the team, routinely completing my work without quality issues. I recently had a long 1-1 with my manager, where I expressed my frustration with being on a trainee salary. I told her the number, to which she expressed ""oh my goodness that's way too low"". She said she would reach out to her boss and HR. It's been a few weeks and I haven't heard anything, so I think I need to take matters into my own hands and initiate.

I already did some research and I am in the bottom 10th-20th percentile in salary for my experience (5+ years) nationally. I know something like a 40% pay bump is out of the question. I'm aiming for 20%.

Some pointers from my side:

\- When I was dedicated to task #1 only team, I completed 20% more than the next team member.

\- I was abruptly switched back to task #2 due to turnover/client needs, which I had not done since mid-2023. I had a few weeks of ramp-up, and now match production of senior team members. It has been by far my most productive year.

\- I have had zero CAPA quality complaints. This has been an ongoing issue with other team members.

\- 2024 will be my second lowest compensation year. I made slightly more as a trainee than now.

The reason I have stuck with this company is the hours are incredibly flexible, the meetings are sparse, and the work has stayed dedicated remote. I have also had a hard time getting my CV through ATS, and haven't received any interviews for 2024, which is a bit concerning.

1hja34q,https://i.redd.it/7w6zviz4h78e1.jpeg,A true story about by friend Vitya,"There was a man named Vitya in a small town. Vitya was an ordinary guy, until one day he decided to try creatine to pump his muscles and become a real athlete. He would fantasise  himself on the cover of the Sportsman of the Year magazine, and this inspired him to do great things.

At first, everything went great — Vitya became stronger, faster, and even learned how to do perfect pull-ups. But he soon noticed that his hair was starting to disappear at an alarming rate. Every time he lifted the barbell, one or two hairs remained on the floor. Vitya did not pay attention to this, because his muscles were growing like yeast in a dough.

But one day, after another workout, he looked in the mirror and saw his reflection: his bald head shone like a brand-new golf ball. Vitya screamed in horror, ""Where is my hair?!"" But instead of getting upset, he decided that it was just a new style. Now he looked like a superhero!

However, his character became more and more strange every day. He began to get angry at everything around him—at the people in line for coffee, at the cats who didn't want to be friends with him, and even at his favorite muscle toy, Barbell 3000. His friends began to notice that Vitya was no longer interested in anything but the gym.

One day, after a workout, he met a group of guys who were also into sports. They discussed their achievements and shared the secrets of the perfect protein shake. Victor felt his heart beat faster. He'd never thought of guys in that light, but now they seemed like real athletic gods to him.

Every day, Vitya became more and more immersed in the world of fitness and male friendship. He began spending his evenings at the gym, where he organized barbell lifting competitions and games of ""who drinks protein faster"". His evil temper gradually subsided, and his bald head became a symbol of his new life.

As a result, Vitya became not only a master of sports, but also the soul of the company. He gathered a group of like-minded people around him and even organized a ""Bald Club"" where everyone could share their successes and funny stories about how creatine changed their lives. 

Thus, Vitya turned from an ordinary guy into a real hero of his city — bald, angry and incredibly athletic!",0,1734788588.0,Creatine,0,0.5,False

Day 1: around 8pm when i started to wear off i had an awful panic attack, but in a weird way. My brain didn’t feel like it was in fight or flight mode but i had all the physical symptoms that feel like im having a heart attack. eventually i was able to convince myself that it was just a panic attack and i wasn’t having a heart attack and calmed myself down.

Day 2 into 3: extreme food aversion, couldn’t even think about eating anything solid; it disgusted me. this has slowed down after it wears off so now I drink a protein shake for lunch and try to eat as much as i can for dinner.

Day 4: rapid heart beat. (Now i’m also in the process of getting tested for PoTs) but as soon as i stood up yesterday my heart rate shot up to 130-140bpm almost hitting 150 at times. my bp was slightly elevated too. only made better by laying down, even just sitting and doing nothing it was still sitting in the 120s. 

Day 5 (today): so far seems like nausea and migraine. (the migraine could be because I haven’t had coffee since day 1 bc i attributed that to the panic attack).

You know those moments when the kids are bouncing off the walls, you've run out of activities, and your coffee hasn't kicked in yet? Yeah, THAT kind of morning 😅

So, I discovered this goldmine of children's colouring pages online (will share links in comments), and OH. MY. GOODNESS. My 5 and 7-year-olds have been quietly coloring for TWO WHOLE HOURS! *happy dance*

Pro tips from my recent coloring page adventure:

* Print extras! Trust me, somebody's going to mess up and need a fresh start
* Keep a ""coloring box"" with crayons, markers, and colored pencils ready to go
* Laminate their favorites so they can color them again with dry-erase markers
* Put on some chill music while they color (currently loving lofi beats)

Best themes that worked for us:  
🦖 Dinosaurs (obvious win)  
🌟 Space and planets  
🦸‍♀️ Superheroes  
🌺 Animals and flowers  
🤖 Robots and vehicles

Bonus parent hack: I've started coloring with them, and it's actually pretty zen! Who knew children's colouring pages could be stress relief for grown-ups too?

1hj9twt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quittingfeelfree/comments/1hj9twt/5_months_clean_some_thoughts/,5 months clean - some thoughts ,"I used to visit this Reddit every single day. I used to read about people’s successful quit stories and think “yeah, maybe I’ll try that next week”. The idea of returning home without stopping to pickup 3-6 from the store every night was unimaginable. The ability to wake up in the morning and not down one with coffee became unimaginable to. On mornings when I would wake up without any, I would make an excuse to my partner to justify the 25 min ride there & back, because man quitting sounded interesting last night but now that it’s time to commit, I’d rather do it tomorrow ya know? 

The list goes on and on. Now I think back on those times and I don’t even recognize myself, or my motivations, or the sneaky things I would do to get my hands on a bottle, or the dozen of times I tried to “quit” for 24 hours or so, only to be a bore and sweat all over my partner just to give in and buy more on day 2. 

I have almost completely forgotten about these shots of poison and I was hooked for 2 solid years. It’s crazy to me how I was digging a hole for myself that entire time, and I think back on emotional moments and can’t help but wonder how differently they would have gone if I wasn’t under the influence at the time. 

I guess I’m not even sure the point of this post. Partially encouragement to people who are scared to quit because it’s another one of those “if I can do it you can do it!!!!” (I also quit during the midst of a long term relationship breakup and after my mom had passed a few months before, so there were a lot of temptations to continue numbing my feelings, but it’s wild how much better you can process emotions when you allow yourself to feel them in the first place…) 

 I also want to connect with people who have been clean for a few months and ask you how you feel when you look back on the feel free blur. Because it feels like a blur to me. And it’s so hard to make peace with the stranger inside me who chose to drink sludge every night and turn my brain off, instead of working on myself and the world around me.

1hj9tcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1hj9tcf/walking_away_from_that_friendship_was_the_hardest/,"Walking away from that friendship was the hardest thing I ever did. 5 months later, I’m in a much better place without her!","TLDR: Friend ended our friendship due to her behavior on drugs. Became friends again and she was so toxic that she spread lie about my bf. Kicked her to the curb, now life is so much better. 

I had known this friend since middle school. We were really good friends up through high school until our senior year. The summer after we graduated another friend had asked me last minute to go to Tennessee with her and I agreed. When I posted pictures of her and I down in Tennessee, ""Cora"" messaged me and the other girl in a group text super upset that she wasn't invited. She started to blame me for accepting the invitation and saying I should've considered her before leaving. I had no clue what was going on, and the other girl told me that she and Cora had discussed going to Tennessee a few months prior, but because Cora never would take time away from work she decided to ask me last minute. Since she had already paid for two people and Cora wouldn't commit Cora ended up blocking me. I was pretty sad because of that, but I was going to college and decided to focus on making new friends.

Flash forward about five years later, I am working at my office job and a new girl is hired for the warehouse named Cora, but had a different last name, so I didn't think about it being her. Sure enough it was Cora from high school and she started to make small talk with me. She asked if I wanted to go get coffee one weekend and I cautiously accepted. I was keeping her at arms length until then during the conversation we shared about how our last few years had been. She had gotten married and was doing pretty good. She then asked how we lost contact seeming like she had no recollection that she was the one who ended the friendship so abruptly. I semi bluntly, reminded her of the Tennessee trip and that she got upset and blocked me, and she said that she had no memory of it. She apologize profusely and admitted that in the last couple years of high school she had been doing drugs which were altering her mentality a lot of the time. I was shocked because I had no clue that she had been doing that to herself and she said that she kept it pretty well hidden. I went back to look at pictures of her during that time and I could really see it in those pictures now that she had told me, but as a kid back, then I was very naïve and sheltered, and never picked up on regarding drug usage.

We became best friends again and I started dating my boyfriend (also from work but from a different part of the campus) around the time of rekindling that friendship, but we had chosen to keep our relationship quiet for the first few months before becoming public to anyone just in case if things were to go sour and our relationship end, we both wouldn't have to deal with gossipers in our small town. When I finally told Cora about dating this guy ""Ricky"", she was very upset. I was shocked by her reaction and I asked her why. Cora said that she thought for those three months I was flirting with her. On a side note, Cora is openly bisexual. I at one point had been bi-curious, but soon realized I am definitely straight. I had shared this with Cora at one point, but I also made it clear that I was attracted to men now. When Cora told me she thought I was flirting with her I apologize and told her that I never intended to flirt with her. I was just trying to rebuild our friendship. She eventually got over it and we moved on, but she was never very kind to Ricky after that, even though before telling her Ricky and I were in a relationship, she had really liked him. Her anger towards him became even more after he and I moved in together. However, I didn't learn the full truth until later. 

In the last three years, I did not realize how toxic really was until the beginning of this year. My mom had Alzheimer's and had been in a nursing home. At the end of November 2023, we were told that we would begin hospice care with her. She had become bedridden around Thanksgiving and was struggling to stand or move in anyway. Three months later, in the middle of February this year I got the call while at work that my mom was in her last days two hours. I left work and spent that last week beside my mom's bed. During that week, I ended up having to turn off my phone because of how excessively Cora was texting asking for updates. On the day that my mom passed, I texted Cora and Ricky to let them both know after I had messaged the rest of the family. Cora started blowing up my phone saying that she was going to leave work to come to me. I told both Cora and Ricky not to leave work because I was going to spend the day at my aunt's house, beginning preparations and then going to the funeral home in the early afternoon. Cora would not stop texting even when I wasn't responding. At one point in the day, I was going back to my house so that I could write the obituary and I sent a text meaning to go to Ricky somehow to Cora. I I think because of her nonstop texting I hit her name at the top of my messages, even though I have been talking to Ricky at that time and trying to ignore Cora.

The text said the following (copy and pasted bc I saved it): ""Thank you, honey. Btw, I'm running home for a half hour till write the obituary then I need to go to the funeral home.  We are working with [redacted]. If you want to come home for a little bit, I don't mind, but I do need to focus on writing the obituary so that I can get in the paper on time. I will let Zack ( my dog) out just before I leave. I'm also going to order Chinese for dinner since it's not far from the funeral home and I don't feel like cooking. I love you.""

The text was clearly meant for Ricky. But Cora responded saying ""I love you too, honey. I'll be there soon."" I didn't read the name when that text came through as I thought it was Ricky responding because Cora never says things like that to me. When core showed up, I was surprised and slightly annoyed, but I was in focus mode on my laptop, typing out the obituary. She gave me a hug and then started helping to clean my kitchen since I had been gone all week with my mom and with Ricky working overtime then coming to the nursing home, we didn't get to clean much. I was very greatful and thanked her when she was done. I had to push her out of the house so I could get to the funeral in time though bc she wanted to sit and talk. 

I told Ricky about it later that night and said that I wished it was him and not her. He then asked if I wanted him to stay home with me the night couple days. I said no, because my sister and I needed to work on getting pictures and clothes together for the funeral home, talk to the pastor presiding over the service, and then I wanted the day before the funeral to myself for some alone time. I told him to just take the day of the funeral off from work. He was very understanding. However, the next day Ricky called me and said that, Cora was spreading rumors at work about him, saying that he's leaving huge messes around the house to clean up and he's cheating on me with someone at work and that's why he's not home with me while I'm crying over my mom. Several coworkers had come up to him to ask if it was true and he said no and called me right away to tell me me. I was livid and texted Cora that it was to stop now, but sent back a whole sob story saying everyone blames her for everything. Who else would have know I had a few dishes in the sink? 

After that, I tried to stay in the friendship for a while longer, but I realized how toxic she'd been those last three years. In August I silently walked away. It was the best thing I ever did. You don't need toxic people in your life. ",1,1734787630.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

Is this considered cheating and am I being dramatic?,"For context my boyfriend and I have been together for almost a year snd ten months. So he called me yesterday and told me he wants to go out with a girl and asked can he. He never has a girl friend before me or during me or ever in his life. He also never talked to another girl besides me or went out with one. I was his first everything, and I was the only girl ever who asked for his snap (that's how we met). I told him I'm lost since I don't know anything about another girl. He told me that when he went on a trip a few days/maybe two weeks ago he met her, she asked for his snap and he told her he is taken, but then I suppose she asked again and he accepted and gave her his snapchat and accepted her. They have been talking since then. When I asked him are they talking every day he told me he doesn't know. When I asked him what were they talking about he doesn't know. I asked him why he accepted to give her his snapchat and why I just found out all of this he said he doesn't know. I asked him if he was planning on telling me about her even if she didn't ask him to go out and when, he said he did but doesn't know when. I told him to screenshot their chat, not because I'm jelous or possesive just for clearance, but I wanted to see if he talks to her the same way he talks to me. In their chats, she told him she is feeling down. He asked what happened, and who does he need to fight for her. Keep in mind they barely even met, and he never ever asked me that. He also told her that she deserves better and that she is a strong independent woman, and that eventually someone unexpected will come into her life. I wonder who. He was also asking her if she is okay and if she is sure she is alright. Along with that they were joking around in their chat like two people who like each other throwing playfull jokes at each other and so on. When I was single, and a guy talked to me like that he was almost always interested about dating me. Also, don't know why the girl pushed about his snapchat if she knew he was taken. He was with his friends at the time, so if she just wanted new friends she would have asked a few of them, or picked a single one. He is telling me she doesn't like him, but all of these signs tell me she does, and he maybe does too. When I asked to see their chats, he refused because he told me I won't understand and that he is just being friendly towards other women. He has plenty of friends in his life, including me so I don't even understand why he would need a female friend. Also, we have been trying to fix another problem in our relationship, which is that he doesn't have time to talk to me during the day, and I have to wait until 10 pm every day to talk to him for a longer time than a few minutes. Yesterday tho, when he asked me if he can go out with her, he was all lovey dovey the whole day and was telling me he loves me no matter what and was sending hearts all day and had time to talk to me somehow. I told him that I knew he was like this because of her, and he didn't deny but just told me he's sorry. It's all he says to me. I'm sorry. I told him he can go out if he wants and that I'm not in a position to tell him if he can or cannot, then he asked me if I want him to and I said no. I'd understand if she is an old frend, that was in his life way before I was and that they want to go grab a coffee. He then told the girl he is sorry for wasting her time and that he cannot go out. I feel like he is the type of guy who says to a girl ""Sorry, I can't, I have a girlfriend."" instead of ""No, I can't, I have a girlfriend."" I was always the second type of girl. Also, throuought this relationship I can't count how many guys slid into my dms or asked me for my number in the middle of the street and I told them no I'm taken every time, even if they pushed. I also have 0 males on my snapchat, except him and my male friend who I have known for many years before my boyfriend, but he is also taken and my bf said he is okay with him. I don't have any other social media. My boyfriend had no females on his snap when we met, but now has plenty, and he usually refuses to give me his phone although he says he's joking with me. I have to mention tho, he is a really kind person, too kind, and he's apparently afraid to say no. We had a similar problem to this before and that's what he told me. After he sent me their messages I blocked him and told him I needed space. Today I informed him I'm taking a break from us. I don't know what to do. Is this considered cheating?

My name is Rence and I'm a freelance web designer. I specialize with Figma, WordPress and Elementor (I can also build on Squarespace). If you are a small to medium-sized business looking to increase their visibility online, then we might be a good fit.

  
Why so cheap? I'm actually looking for side projects that I can do to update my own [portfolio](https://rencejain.com/portfolio/) since a lot of designs here doesn't reflect my current skill level. I feel like it would be a waste if I created demo websites so I might as well help someone with their website and get paid for it.

  
Rest assured that you'll still be getting my top quality work. The only catch is that it will take longer than usual (4 to 6 weeks) since I have main projects I'm working on right now. **If you need the website anytime soon, this is not for you.** And if you need something more customized, here is my [main gig](https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1hj781a/for_hire_freelance_web_designer_projectbased/) for more information.

  
There are specific website projects that I can give you more discounts for since I personally want to design for them:

* Photography
* Wedding photography
* Vacation resort
* Coffee shop
* Fitness coach

If not, that's fine! I'm sure we'd still be able to work something out so please feel free to reach out.

  
That's it for me! If you have any questions, concerns or even just want to say hello and show some support, feel free to reach out to me through [webdesign@rencejain.com](mailto:webdesign@rencejain.com). Let's see if we'd be a good fit and cook something good (: Have an awesome day!

1hj9oqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hj9oqm/aitah_for_letting_my_family_members_talkativeness/,AITAH for letting my family member's talkativeness break me? ,"I'm an introvert - a *hard-core* introvert. As much as I can be bubbly and outgoing at work, with my kids, or with friends I absolutely need my quiet time at home to recharge. My husband is very similar and we're a good fit in that way because we don't monopolize each other's time. 

A month and a half ago a family member found himself in need of a place to stay for a while. We opened our home no questions asked. Family is family and you take care of family. He was incredibly grateful and was an immaculate houseguest: he cooked, he cleaned, he was tidy, he worked quite a few miracles in our front yard, etc. I couldn't have asked for better. 

Except for one thing: he never stopped talking. 

I'm a morning person and my routine used to be to get up a couple hours before I have to start work or get the kids up so I can enjoy a quiet cup of coffee and a book or my phone. This family member is also a morning person, so he began waking up around the same time I did and once he was in my vicinity *the talking started*. Although it sometimes involved back and forth conversation, it was mostly just story time about himself and his experiences from the moment he saw my face till the moment I finally escaped to get ready for work.

When I get home from work - a physically demanding job - I like to sit on the couch for a bit to decompress before starting any chores or projects that need doing. But once our family member gets back from his own job the talking starts again. So not only were my mornings destroyed, my evenings were, too. 

We got a brief reprieve when we showed him how to use the TV downstairs. For a few days he was happy hanging out by himself watching shows and I could breathe again, but then he discovered we only had a certain streaming service on our upstairs TV (sharing accounts and I don't know the password to put it on the downstairs one) and it had a lot of shows he liked so he started monopolizing that. My husband works nights a lot and I'm not a confrontational person so I let it happen. Ugh. 

I've taken to hiding in my room whenever I'm home. I have almost lived in my bedroom for the past two weeks. I'm sleeping more because there's nothing to do in the bedroom, chores and projects are being neglected, but I can no longer bear to go anywhere in my house. Not even to eat. Sometimes I'll leave and get fast food even though we have a fully stocked fridge, simply because walking out to the kitchen for more than 5 seconds triggers the talking and I am so broken down at this point I can't stomach the thought of enduring even a little more. Even when he's not there the stress of wondering when he'll be getting back won't allow me to relax.

A few days ago I broke down completely and went to my parent's place for the night just to get away. It was a wonderful and healing visit, but it also cemented the idea in my head that my house has been invaded, that it's no longer mine. Far from being the refuge it used to be, my house is *actively hostile* now. As soon as I walk through the door I shed my coat and shoes as quickly as possible and disappear into my room. I don't come out again except for extreme necessities. 

My husband is getting fed up with me. At first he thought my reaction was kind of funny, but now he's annoyed. He's been on the receiving end of the talking a little bit, but due to his work schedule he doesn't spend as much time at the house as I do, so to him the talking is annoying, but not mental-health threatening. He's also more assertive than me, so he has no problem outright ignoring this person as they talk, or reclaiming the TV, etc. Yesterday, when he came home and found me in bed, lights off, trying to sleep at 8:30pm, he called me ridiculous and said it ""wasn't that bad, c'mon."" Maybe it isn't. Maybe I'm completely overreacting.

The family member is leaving tomorrow. If he doesn't, I'm going to have to move out. My home, my sanctuary has been destroyed. I hate it here now and, even after he's gone, I feel like it's going to take a little time to rebuild what I had.

At last once a week, I'll go to my local coffee shop. It's about 2 miles there and back. Ordering 1 of my usuals of coffees with a pastry as well. 

Some may say, ""You're ruining all of your progress!"" I see it as supporting your local small business. Talking with others in a joyous conversation. Everyone can enjoy being themselves. Getting some exercise and movement in for the day.

Once I'm done, starting heading to the original start. A watch is on. I'm walking my pace because imposter syndrome is real. Trying to not compare myself with others. I didn't know if I'll reach those high marks of steps.

I'm a disabled person. I have limitations. I acknowledge this. So if a ""good day"" is 2000-3000 steps, I'll take it. Making sure I'm not pushing to a flare-up. If this happens, the number of days I'm out is between 1-3 weeks of recovery. I walk forearm crutches and wheeled walker (rollator).

Walking had helped incredibly with my mental health. Whether I walk in the morning or evening, it gives me a place to ""clear my mind."" Whether it's at a park or in my neighborhood, it gives me a lift. Hearing the birds singing. The squirrels either looking at me or make their warning sounds. The occasional deer eating, in the bush, as I stroll away. 

For those who think you're not good enough because you're not making high steps, it's not true. Focus on what your need to do for yourself. And I'm still working on this. If you can mute their posts, feel free. I know I have done this many times.

Thoughts on this? Would this come under fair wear Landlord is trying to charge £450 in damages for paint peeling in bathroom. and tear? 

My old landlord is trying to charge £450 in damages for peeling paint in the bathroom and claiming it’s because the extractor fan was not used correctly.

Even though I used to extractor fan (which barely worked and needed replacing) daily for showers AND opened the window. I was also cleaning black mould off the walls every other month and repaired heavy green marks in the storage cupboard and coffee stains off the radiator tops that were there when I moved in which I never complained about and I mentioned this to him. 

In truth the place was just in desperate need of a new paint job since I moved in and that’s why the paint peeled, not because I caused it (as I used the extractor fan and window was open daily) the paint peeled because it desperately needed a new paint job, and I’ve mentioned this. 

Essentially I went above the state of the property when I moved in to make it look nice for him as he had been a great landlord. Yet still he’s trying to claim damages, it’s a shame as I expected it wouldn’t come to this. 

Is it also worth mentioning to him that I had to deal with water leaking from the light fixtures and a potential gas leak that was prevented? He fixed these issues with contractors fast so if he fixed them maybe it’s not worth mentioning? But let me know what you think. 

Is this reasonable from the landlord or is this fair wear and tear and I should deffo contest if it goes to it? (I’d rather sort it out between us first though)

Jim Norton: Lemme guess—two idiots with fake laughs, a chick who pretends to be “one of the guys,” and some fart noises?

Opie: Pretty much. Today we’re diving into The Morning Zoo Crew out of Cleveland.

Anthony: Cleveland. Jesus Christ, they’ve got enough problems without this dumpster fire on their airwaves.

Jim Norton: Cleveland? What’s their slogan? “We’re not Detroit, but we’re trying”?

Opie: Alright, let’s start with how they opened their show yesterday. Sam, roll the clip.

[Audio Clip Begins: Over-the-top morning radio intro with explosions, honking, and an airhorn. A man yells, ""WAKE UP, CLEVELAND! IT’S THE ZOO CREW!""]

Zoo Host #1: Good morning, Cleveland! It’s your boy Danny “The Wildman” Johnson, and I’m here with my partner in crime, Trisha “The Sassy One” Monroe!

Zoo Host #2: Good morning, Danny! We’ve got a jam-packed show today—Taylor Swift tickets, a pumpkin spice latte taste test, and… [drumroll sound effect]… a special visit from our boss!

Zoo Host #1: Oh no! [Fake exaggerated groan] Not the boss! Somebody hide the donuts!

Jim Norton: Hide the donuts? More like hide the f***ing microphones. Jesus Christ, I’ve heard better material at a school assembly.

Opie: And they’re teasing the boss visit like it’s a big event. What’s he gonna do, yell at them for being unfunny hacks?

Anthony: Nah, he’s probably just stopping by to pick up his paycheck before he quits.

Jim Norton: Honestly, if I had to manage these clowns, I’d drink bleach before I showed up on air.

Opie: Alright, here’s their big “pumpkin spice latte taste test” segment.

[Audio Clip Begins: Dramatic game show music fades in.]

Zoo Host #1: Alright, Trisha, it’s time for the PSL Showdown! We’ve got lattes from Starbucks, Dunkin’, and—wait for it—Greg’s Gas Station Coffee!

Zoo Host #2: Oh my gosh, Danny, I don’t know if I’m ready for Greg’s! [Laughs hysterically]

Zoo Host #1: You gotta take a sip! [Slurping sound effect] Oh man, this tastes like sadness.

Zoo Host #2: [Gasping] Ew! It tastes like… like… my ex-boyfriend’s cooking! [More fake laughter]

Anthony: [Howling with laughter] What the f*** was that? “It tastes like my ex-boyfriend’s cooking”? That’s the punchline?

Jim Norton: Yeah, Trisha, we get it. You’ve got an ex-boyfriend. Congrats on being just as funny as a f***ing bumper sticker.

Opie: And that slurping sound effect! Because apparently, their audience has the IQ of a f***ing toddler.

Anthony: I love how they’re trying to make “gas station coffee” this edgy thing. Like, ooooh, what rebels! “We drank bad coffee!” Shut the f*** up.

Jim Norton: Yeah, Greg’s Gas Station Coffee—the official drink of people who’ve given up on life.

Opie: Alright, let’s get to the big moment—the boss shows up.

[Audio Clip Begins: Door creaking sound effect, followed by ominous music.]

Zoo Host #1: Uh-oh, Trisha, look who just walked in—it’s the big man himself, Mr. Jeff “The Hammer” Thompson!

Zoo Host #2: [Fake nervous voice] Oh no, Danny! Are we in trouble?

Boss Voice: [Clearly the same guy doing a deeper voice] You bet you are! I heard you were giving away my parking spot on the air!

Zoo Host #1: Oh no! Not the parking spot!

Zoo Host #2: Don’t fire us, Jeff! We’ll… we’ll buy you a pumpkin spice latte! [Laugh track plays]

Anthony: [Crying laughing] Holy s***, that was worse than I expected.

Jim Norton: “The Hammer”? That guy doesn’t sound like he could hammer a f***ing nail.

Opie: And the fake deep voice! Who do they think they’re fooling? It sounds like he’s trying to order porn over the phone without getting caught.

Anthony: This is the level of comedy we’re dealing with. “Oh no, the boss is mad because of… a parking spot!” Jesus, just set the station on fire and collect the insurance money.

Jim Norton: Honestly, I think Greg from the gas station coffee should take over the show. He’d probably be funnier.

Opie: Alright, I can’t take anymore. That’s enough Zoo Crew for today.

Anthony: Cleveland, I feel bad for you. Not because you’re Cleveland, but because you have to listen to this s***.

Plenty of comfortable seating

[https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1hj9cyp/my\_mother\_and\_our\_karen\_neighbour\_are\_atwar\_repost/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1hj9cyp/my_mother_and_our_karen_neighbour_are_atwar_repost/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)



So I had just asked my mother about her experience Karen, and oh boy!

Back when my mother first went up to invite Karen to that party at the beginning, she knocked on her door to introduce herself. Karen opened the upstairs window, and said in a tone that wouldn’t even be fitting when addressing an angry child: “The doorbell works you know.” 

After that lovely greeting, a rather awkward conversation followed. My mother inquired if she was going to turn this place into a Guest House, but she denied it with a cheery smile. 

What about the Welcome Party?

Well, I had taken it upon myself to babysit Karen’s daughter, (and while thinking back, her companion and his daughter not showing up was a *huge* red flag) Karen was boasting about her *education* and how her position in communication made the company quote: “cannot survive without her”.

FWI I am told my father, who works in Human Resources, was starting to get a pretty good idea about who they were going to live with for the next ten years.

I bet you all must be wondering: what is Karen’s goal in coming here? Well, kudos to my mother’s Force-Sight because she was 200% right about the Guest House plan! 

There’s just one little thing: in my country, you *have* to live in a guest house, otherwise what you are running is an AirBNB and the *prices* to run a Guest House happen to be *significantly* lower than an AirBNB. 

Well, remember the fact I barely saw the children outside? Karen and her companion live elsewhere, in one of the nearby villages. And yes, that’s technically illegal but you understand: they don’t want to be woken up by travellers they *tell* can arrive at dawn with noisy cars. Not that’s only for the light sleepers like my mom to be bothered by that.

People, we call women “Karen” because they’re crazy but a *manipulating* Karen who works in communication is the worst! 

When Karen got her first customers, my mom, like Marinette Dupain-Chen on one of her psychotic breaks, listened in as they left. They were wishing her “good luck with the mean woman next door”. So she’s talking shit about my mom to her customers.

Even better, my mom is spying on her reviews, the first review she ever got, where the customer ratted her out for not being present (because you know AirBNB-Guest House has different expectations), she also called out Karen for being rude and not giving her back her money. Well, that review mysteriously disappeared after a couple of months.

Her customers aren’t the only ones she’s talking crap about my mom to. People, she has managed to turn *everyone* in the neighbourhood against us. How? Well, of course, the isolated lonely single mother with pets can’t possibly be evil. 

I never thought I would understand Alastor’s lesson about smiling the hard way. (And that killed me to write that, Alastor is best character!)

Why is she being nice to the neighbours, especially the old lady with animals? Well, she’s a busy woman! She can’t be expected to bring back the animals she bought solely for her Guest House when they run off! No no no! That’s up to the peasants who've never gotten out of the village to do that. 

Poor Ponies…

Karen only bought them as a business expense, but I just recently learned HOW much she doesn’t care about them *at all.* 

My mom and sister (25) bumped into an old friend who is a horse expert yesterday, and she needed a place to put her horses for a while. Horses can damage a field but my mom offered our garden and while she seemed interested in the offer she suddenly asked if we lived next to Karen. And a whole lot of truth came out. 

Karen’s ponies escaped to see her horses. Why? Because Karen’s animals aren’t castrated. Which is why she can’t have her horses next to hers and refused my mom’s offer. When they escaped the first time, Karen expected the Expert to put her escaped animals back in her place for her (no surprises there from Entitled Karen) but the Expert saw loads of red flags: 

First: Karen does not take her animals to the vet (wtf?)

Second, she didn’t castrate them, her reasoning? “Well, they’re brother and sister, it’s fine!” Karen! Animals aren’t humans! I bet she learned that the hard way because she now has a third baby pony that my sister calls Charles III or Cleopatra just to make her point.

Third! Karen’s ponies don’t have enough grass to eat, which could explain why they keep escaping because they’re hungry. And what does Karen do about it? Why: nothing of course!

The Expert wanted to call (equivalent) Animal Control, but the old kind lady who lives next door to us has a pony of her own who lives in a large field *alone*. And that’s bad for a pony to be alone and while the Kind-Old lady is with him all the time, the Expert didn’t want the risk of Animal Control taking it away too. 

Meanwhile, Karen is a sore loser because as soon as the bornage verdict came out, Karen has been spreading rumours about our family and most especially my mom. How do we know? A childhood friend of mine overheard the conversation between two people she knew and having been at my house before she knew exactly who the conversation was about, and more truth came out.

Do you remember Karen’s ex-husband?

Well, turns out she managed to turn his own family against him. Guys, I **KNOW** that divorce can be messy, and it’s not right to take sides without the whole story. But… seeing how Karen spread lies about my mom, can you blame me if I have doubts the culprit was that poor man? But I won’t tell my family what I think, that’s Karen’s own private business.

Back to our sheep! 

You think it can’t get any worse: it can trust me, it can! What else could Karen possibly destroy that we adore in our area? 

Why: the *forest*, of course!

My Sherlock Mom, losing sleep over this, checks her account and websites regularly and discovers Karen is planning to upgrade the number of beds in her little business. Only one thing: what about the cars? Where are gonna put them? 

My mom saw her boyfriend and his father cleaning up the forest in front of the house.

Yes, people. She planned to transform a public forest into her parking lot.

Mind you there was no WAY we would allow it to happen and even more, her cleaning up caused flooding into our house (thanks, Karen!).

Enters: the mayor.

At first, we find out the mayor *hates her*. (I laughed, mind you!) She used her manipulations on him and it didn’t work. Oh, did I mention Karen’s mom? Vice President of the County. Well, when the mayor received her phone calls about Karen’s “innocent little project” (his words) he told them to f\*ck off.

Why, was he mad? Because Karen’s clients park their cars where she told them to! In the fire lane area where the garbage tow-trucks turn around. Guess who didn’t show up for a month because they had enough of waking up everyone in the street at six am in the morning? By that time, a lot of the neighbours were starting to wake up to her BS, except the Vs. 

We tried to buy the area of the forest, but it turns out, we can’t. It belongs to the city and so following our warning, the area will be fenced.

Do you think it's over? It’s ***still*** not over people!

A Guest House is good, but a coffee place is better!

It’s a nightmare people, she wants to extend her business for wine tasting. Turns out the mayor is not as much on our side than we thought. He’s a politician, he’ll do anything to please everyone until he goes forward with his career. So basically, he tells my mom one thing, but he tells Karen another.

Well, why is he still in this story? She needs a permit for her little business and she needs to make her business official. She has it, but she was required to the neighbourhood about it.

So the mayor, my parents and all our neighbours had some kind of official meeting, which my parents had to attend by Zoom *but* turns out they didn’t have to! A friend of theirs, who’s also the father of another childhood friend of mine, offered to represent them and my mom gave him *everything* she collected about Karen’s little project. Meanwhile, Karen was saying she wanted to do a small wine-tasting area, nothing more.

Nothing more?

The activities, the hiking, the coffee place, the employees, everything she offered was nothing *more*? 

And how did Karen plan to bring her customers over? With large, very large buses. People, the forest, would have to be *trimmed* for buses like that to come up to our area, let alone park. 

And boy the face he described she had when he laid down the facts. Karen stopped talking *very* quickly like a child being grounded on Thanksgiving! How did my mom discover so much? Well, it's all on Karen’s media platforms! 

She was just telling one part of the truth not to lie down that she was turning our home into her business field. 

So that’s where we are so far.

My parents are exhausted people, and they would have nothing against Karen’s business if she stopped lying to them and everyone over and over. Heck, *we* own an Airbnb!

I want them to know they aren’t alone, I don’t expect much advice against someone like this but I do hope I show them some support.

My old landlord is trying to charge £450 in damages for peeling paint in the bathroom and claiming it’s because the extractor fan was not used correctly.

Even though I used to extractor fan (which barely worked and needed replacing) daily for showers AND opened the window. I was also cleaning black mould off the walls every other month and repaired heavy green marks in the storage cupboard and coffee stains off the radiator tops that were there when I moved in which I never complained about and I mentioned this to him. 

In truth the place was just in desperate need of a new paint job since I moved in and that’s why the paint peeled, not because I caused it (as I used the extractor fan and window was open daily) the paint peeled because it desperately needed a new paint job, and I’ve mentioned this. 

Essentially I went above the state of the property when I moved in to make it look nice for him as he had been a great landlord. Yet still he’s trying to claim damages, it’s a shame as I expected it wouldn’t come to this. 

Is it also worth mentioning to him that I had to deal with water leaking from the light fixtures and a potential gas leak that was prevented? He fixed these issues with contractors fast so if he fixed them maybe it’s not worth mentioning? But let me know what you think. 

Is this reasonable from the landlord or is this fair wear and tear and I should deffo contest if it goes to it? (I’d rather sort it out between us first though)

About me:

• 5'11, Athletic and from the East End of Toronto.

•Educated and a working professional. I’m into self-improvement books, economics, movies, guitar, and travel. Would also enjoy the occasional debate over conspiracy theories.

• DDF, I am strict with my hygiene (skin cleansers, colognes, etc).

• Keeping things light and simple - I want to keep any encounter fun and enjoyable. My ideas include taking you to a board game café, a drive down to a waterfront trail, and a drink or two sitting close at the bar. Just a way to get to know someone new, take our minds off of work + life for a while, enjoy some decent conversation, and unwind. Also, I promise no heavy conversation topics unless you want to yap about conspiracies or whatever TikTok trend has got you hooked. (I will politely have to pass on Flat Earthers).

* Safety - Also want to emphasize that I’m just as worried about women creeps as you are worried about men creeps. Our jobs might require discretion with meetups like these. To alleviate any concerns, we’ll have a quick phone chat to make sure we’re real, exchange photos offline, meet somewhere public and chat to see if we vibe.

What I’m looking for:

I’m looking for a woman on the same page as me and is looking for some good company and a genuinely fun time. My ideal fantasy would be to meet someone who’s chill, easygoing, and not trying to take life so seriously. 

The plan:

Send me a DM if this interests you. Let’s have a quick phone call to make sure we’re real before sending pics to see if we’re into each other. If we are, let’s set up a date and make this happen.",1,1734786217.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

Let me tell you my story. Sorry for such a lengthy text. 
I started preparing to the IELTS exam half an year ago. I bought the online courses with individual lessons with a tutor, and the lessons were held few times per week. I did like her (my tutor) from the very beginning, I must mention. I am 19, and she is 23. Things were flowing pretty ordinary for the first two months or so, we were discussing the topic of the exam itself only, but then we began to talk about other stuff as well, like shooting the breeze from time to time as it normally happens, but not so much, don't want to create a false impression. Of course, there has been some sort of development of our professional relationship over time. During our speaking sessions she often was saying that my answers are unique compared to what her students usually respond. But the most striking thing to me was the following one: I am currently pursuing degree in biology, and I sometimes included the stuff related to this to my speaking answers. This was one of this cases. I just mentioned it superficially, indicating that probably I should not use any of those scientific stuff too much, and that it was just a knee jerk reaction of mine. But to my surprise she seemed to be genuinely interested and asked me to elaborate on it. I was shocked as most of the time people shun those topics, especially everything regarding biology. I asked her if I am not taking her time as it was the very end of the lesson. She stayed to listen to the scientific stuff, even though I strived to make it as short as possible. And then she said that I am very good at explaining stuff (to be honest, in this particular situation, I doubt it as I was a bit nervous in the process, and it affected my productivity). 
Meanwhile, my exam was approaching, and the day before it I told her that if I get an overall score 8, I owe her a cup coffee. She replied that if I manage to get an 8, then she owes my 2 cups of coffee. I did receive the aforementioned score. She congratulated me very emotionally, I thanked her multiple times, but no one brought up the stuff about coffee because, I suspect, both of us perceived it as a joke, like a motivation for a good performance. Then I got a recognition letter from my test center, which was honoring me for such a great score. The test center was curious who I was gearing up to the exam with. I sent the screenshots of the letter to my mentor, saying that it would be a decent advertising for their preparation center and they, especially her, deserve it. Thanked her once again. Then the sentiments followed from both of us, she said that I was one of the most successful students of her and it was a pleasure to work with me. Nothing about coffee again. The third time I reached her out was when I received the breakdown of my IELTS score a month later. It was her idea to request it, so I found it relevant to DM her again. I sent a big message, pointing out that I am grateful for what he did for me once more and that she was one of the best tutors of mine. In response she, all of a sudden, brought up the coffee offer herself, suggesting to meet. Again, it happened a month later after our last contact. And I am wondering if it is a professional courtesy or something more personal? Probably it is a stupid question to ask, but I want to hear a point from detached perspective as my rationale might be clouded.
And one more question: we didn't specify the exact date of meeting, just agreed that it's gonna be in January next year. Should I reach her out to clarify it, or am I better to wait for her doing so as it was her to suggest to treat me with coffee. I am asking cause I don't want to seem intrusive. 
Asking you because I am an absolute noob in human interactions. Maybe there is some sort of romantic hints or am I delusional and all that stuff  is just a courtesy? Thanks for your time.",1,1734786180.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

""I can't physically crave something that I've never tried before. That's why I shouldn't ever even taste alcohol and I'd be free from an addiction that hurts so many people. It's as easy as simply not knowing""  
  
And yes, that is true. No concept = no desire. However as I get older I start to think that I might need to reconsider my values.  
  
All my friends drink. All my relatives drink. All my coworkers. EVERYONE I KNOW drinks. I don't. Alcohol is the only drug in the world that you have to explain why you DON'T use it. My mom gets terrible head aches and stomach aches but still drinks. My grandpa got so addicted that he MUST keep drinking to stay alive. My sister drank so much she had to be hospitalized. My coworker got fired because he repeatedly skipped work to just drink. I sat at so many uncomfortable gatherings where people got wasted and started hurting each other mentally and physically. AND YET so many people suggest me to start drinking.   
  
And here I am thinking.. should I ""learn"" to drink? Not because I want to experience being drunk, but because I want to fit in. I'm missing out. Everyone is having fun while I'm intentionally cutting myself out. I think I should start drinking just because that's what people my age do. That is normal and EXPECTED in our society.   
  
I'm a person who gets easily addicted to a lot of random things. Coffee, sugar, food, specific games (recovering from porn addiction, clean for +-140 days now). I just don't trust myself. I don't want to start simply because I might later struggle to stop.   
  
Is it worth it to start drinking to fit in, and permanently curse my mind with the concept of alcohol?

""Skibi Toilet Chronicles: Surviving UNSW with Brain Rot and Fanum Tax""","1. Skibi Toilet Study Sessions

Alright, picture this: You’re deep in the UNSW library, it’s 3 AM, the only light is the glow of your screen and your future hopes flickering out like the last strand of WiFi. You’ve been procrastinating for so long that your brain is now a skibi toilet—just a swirling mess of half-baked ideas and abandoned tasks. At this point, your essay is a work of fiction, and your to-do list is just a collection of random thoughts like, “Did I feed the cat? Oh wait, I don’t have a cat.”

You try to focus, but suddenly, you remember the Fanum Tax—the unavoidable mental tax you pay every time you try to concentrate. 5 minutes of focus? Boom. You’ve just spent 20 minutes watching conspiracy theories on TikTok. ""Is the moon actually a hologram?"" you ask yourself. You’ll never know.

2. The Fanum Tax Is Real

You know what they say: a university degree is just a tax on your brain cells. If you don't have brain rot by the end of it, you didn't do it right. The Fanum Tax hits hardest when you’re trying to read one paragraph of your textbook and you accidentally start rewatching an entire season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians for no reason. Suddenly, it's 5 AM, your brain is a skibi toilet, and your lecture starts in an hour. Do you go to class or attempt to finish that assignment that’s now just a few words and a lot of existential dread? The answer is: both, because why not suffer in every way possible?

3. Procrastination Level: Skibi Toilet

Last night was a classic case of skibi toilet brain rot. I sat down with a cup of coffee, determined to finish my essay. But the second my fingers touched the keyboard, my brain was like, “Lol, nope. We’re going on a mental vacation.” Next thing I know, I'm knee-deep in YouTube rabbit holes, watching videos on why hot sauce is the key to immortality. Meanwhile, the deadline is looming, and my Fanum Tax balance is rising faster than my caffeine-induced anxiety.

So there I was at 4 AM, trying to type up a conclusion while simultaneously Googling how to apologize to my lecturer for not doing the thing I was supposed to do, when I accidentally sent an email that said, ""Dear Professor, I am a skibi toilet and cannot function."" 10/10, would not recommend.

4. The Skibi Toilet Assignment Panic

The beauty of UNSW is that you’ll often find yourself in a skibi toilet panic. You start your assignment at 11:59 PM. You open the file and suddenly have 47 tabs open on your browser. You’re Googling, ""What’s a Fanum Tax?"" “How to write an essay with no brain?” and of course, “Can I actually pay my fee with caffeine?"" Then, your brain does the thing where it thinks it’s found an idea, but it's just an ad for a skibi toilet cleaner. That’s it, you think. This is your new topic: How skibi toilets reflect the existential struggle of uni life.

# [Assessing Trump’s Critical Minerals Strategy and its Effects (December 2024)](https://www.knightsbridgesg.com/post/assessing-trump-s-critical-minerals-strategy-and-its-effects-december-2024)

# Key Takeaways:

* KSG assesses that Trump will likely boost domestic critical minerals mining through permitting reform, financial support for mining, defense procurement, and tariffs as key policy levers. In contrast, the outlook for clean energy incentives and international collaboration on critical minerals policies appears less favorable under a second Trump administration.
* President Biden has driven significant growth in downstream sectors, such as battery manufacturing, but the mining and processing of critical minerals have not kept pace, continuing U.S. reliance on imports. Addressing this imbalance will likely require a shift in approach under a Trump administration.
* Trump will likely boost U.S. mining and processing, but reversing decades of underdevelopment will be slow, leaving China’s dominance over critical mineral supply chains largely intact throughout the remainder of this decade.
* Tariffs on Chinese imports of critical minerals will likely spur U.S. mining but increase costs for industries like defense and electric vehicles (EVs), with potential Chinese retaliatory restrictions of critical mineral exports disrupting critical supply chain

# U.S. Critical Minerals Policy to Date: 

 

***Trump will inherit several acts, partnerships and memoranda of understanding introduced by the Biden Administration on U.S. critical minerals policy, including:***

* [Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ58/PLAW-117publ58.pdf) (IIJA) (2021): Allocated $1.2 trillion to infrastructure, driving demand for critical minerals. Highlights included $7.5 billion for EV chargers, $73 billion for power grid modernization, and $65 billion for broadband expansion, increasing demand for minerals like copper.
* [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.congress.gov/117/plaws/publ169/PLAW-117publ169.pdf) (IRA) (2022): Offered $7,500 EV tax credits linked to battery minerals sourced from the U.S. or allied countries, $500 million in incentives for critical mineral mining and processing, $40 billion in loan guarantees available for critical minerals projects, and support for solar, wind, and energy storage technologies reliant on materials such as lithium, nickel, and rare-earth elements (REE).
* [Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1042/text) (2024): Prohibits uranium imports from Russia with a [waiver](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1042) for nuclear power plant (NPP) operators extending until 2028.
* [ADVANCE Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6544/text) (2024): Supports the development of advanced nuclear reactors and domestic nuclear fuel supply chains. The Department of Energy also allocated [$2.7 billion](https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-27-billion-president-bidens-investing-america-agenda-boost-domestic-nuclear#:~:text=This%20RFP%20is%20supported%20by,Secretary%20of%20Energy%20Jennifer%20M.) in March 2024 for domestic uranium enrichment projects.
* [Minerals Security Partnership](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership/) (MSP) (2022): Unites the U.S., the EU, and 21 other countries to promote sustainable critical mineral supply chains, with key projects in Angola, Australia, Canada, the U.S., and Tanzania.
* Bilateral agreements included a 2023 Critical Minerals Agreement (CMA) with [Japan](https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/US%20Japan%20Critical%20Minerals%20Agreement%202023%2003%2028.pdf) to collaborate on supply chains for cobalt, graphite, lithium, manganese, and nickel; a 2022 [Memorandum of Understanding](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2023.01.13-E-4-Release-MOU-USA-DRC-ZAMBIA-Tripartite-Agreement-Tab-1-MOU-for-U.S.-Assistance-to-Support-DRC-Zambia-EV-Value-Chain-Cooperation-Instrument.pdf) (MOU) with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia to develop an EV supply chain leveraging their copper and cobalt resources; and a 2024 MOU with [India](https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/secretary-raimondo-and-minister-goyal-convene-6th-us-india-commercial) focused on strengthening critical minerals supply chains.

**Changes Under Trump**

Trump thus inherits significant challenges in boosting domestic mining and supply growth, but has access to key tools such as permitting reform, mining incentives, defense procurement, tariffs, and targeted international collaboration to reduce U.S. reliance on China. 

KSG assesses that Trump is likely to adopt an expansionist approach to U.S. mining, marking a departure from the more cautious policies of the Biden administration. However, achieving substantial reductions in U.S. dependence on China-dominated supply chains is unlikely within a single presidential term and will require sustained and coordinated efforts extending well into the next decade.

# Forward Look:

    Financial Support

* KSG assesses that a Trump administration is likely to extend financial support, including tax incentives, grants, and loans, to boost U.S. critical mineral mining. Bipartisan efforts to reduce reliance on China for critical minerals, combined with traditional Republican support for extractive industries, will likely drive these initiatives.
* U.S. mineral producers will likely require increased public financial support to enhance output, particularly given low prices for key energy transition metals like cobalt, lithium, and nickel. For instance, Talon Metals’ [Tamarack nickel project](https://talonmetals.com/) in Minnesota faces significant market uncertainties, while the scheduled closure of Lundin Mining’s [Eagle Mine](https://www.eaglemine.com/) in Michigan by 2029 threatens to leave the U.S. without domestic nickel production. REE mining operations, such as California’s Mountain Pass facility—the only active REE mine and processing plant in the U.S.—are also likely to need substantial government support to stay competitive. Uranium 
* KSG assesses that Trump, who has expressed pro-nuclear views during his campaign, is likely to back financial initiatives aimed at bolstering U.S. uranium mining and enrichment capabilities, including the ADVANCE Act. This aligns with the critical role nuclear energy could play in powering data centers, which are essential for maintaining U.S. leadership over China in artificial intelligence development—a priority Trump has also emphasized. Currently, the U.S. operates only one [uranium enrichment plant](https://www.urenco.com/global-operations/uusa), leaving it heavily reliant on imports of enriched uranium, including from Russia. Domestic uranium mining remains at a [fraction](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-t-z/usa-nuclear-fuel-cycle) of its post-WWII peak, highlighting the need for significant investment to reduce dependence on foreign sources and strengthen U.S. energy security.Permitting                                                               
* Permitting reform is likely to be a top priority in a second Trump administration, with a shift toward centralized decision-making and reduced regulatory barriers. After decades of decline, U.S. mining is regaining prominence, driven by the energy transition, renewed demand, and bipartisan consensus on the needs to reduce U.S. supply chain dependence on China. Reviving centralized oversight and permitting would likely help revitalise the industry by centralizing permitting and decision-making in Washington, significantly reducing bureaucratic delays.
* Both Trump and Elon Musk, who has been nominated to head a new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have [stressed](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/12/26/2017-27899/a-federal-strategy-to-ensure-secure-and-reliable-supplies-of-critical-minerals) the need for bringing more mines online. KSG assesses that Musk will leverage his influence with the new White House to advocate for streamlined federal oversight. Additionally, faster permitting processes would enhance Tesla’s supply chain security, particularly for critical minerals like [lithium](https://www.piedmontlithium.com/piedmont-lithium-amends-agreement-with-tesla/) and [nickel](https://talonmetals.com/tesla-and-talon-metals-enter-into-supply-agreement-for-nickel/).
* KSG assesses that Trump is likely to expedite mining permits on federal lands and overturn President Biden’s moratorium on mining in Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Area, aligning himself with Republican [criticism](https://stauber.house.gov/media/in-the-news/two-sides-square-hearing-bill-ban-mining-near-boundary-waters) of banning mining in the area.IRA Clean Energy Tax Credits
* KSG assesses that Trump is likely to repeal IRA tax credits for EVs and renewable energy, potentially dismantling the legislation. Musk will likely advocate for repealing EV tax credits, which currently benefit Ford and GM more than Tesla due to their legacy costs. Eliminating subsidies would enhance Tesla’s competitive edge as a pure-play EV maker, allowing it to capture market [share](https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/united-states) domestically, even if overall EV demand growth slows. KSG assesses that investments in solar and onshore wind energy will persist, even with reduced subsidies, albeit at a slower pace, driven by the cost competitiveness of electricity generated from these renewable sources.
* However, repealing the IRA will likely face resistance, including from Republican lawmakers, as GOP districts have disproportionately benefited from IRA-driven investments in EV, battery, and solar manufacturing. Losing these subsidies will likely reduce EV demand, weaken U.S. critical mineral supply chains, and hinder domestic mining growth, increasing reliance on China.

* Tariffs
* KSG assesses that imposing tariffs on critical mineral imports from China would likely incentivize domestic extraction by making U.S. mining operations more competitive and stabilizing prices of key critical minerals currently depressed by global oversupply. While this would benefit domestic mining, tariffs on processed minerals would likely harm U.S. industries reliant on these materials—such as EV manufacturing—by increasing production costs and reducing domestic consumption.Defense Procurement
* KSG assesses that increased military spending under a Trump administration is likely to include greater procurement of critical minerals essential for defense. Expanding the National Defense Stockpile with reserves sourced from domestic projects would help insulate U.S. defense industries from potential Chinese export restrictions on critical minerals, a likely retaliatory measure in response to tariffs. Implementing a long-term stockpiling program with guaranteed, pre-negotiated prices for producers could further mitigate against price volatility and encourage greater investment in U.S. mining and processing operations. Likely beneficiaries of such a program include junior miners focused on REE extraction, such as American Rare Earth, MP Materials, and Ramaco Resources, which would gain greater price stability and market certainty to advance their projects.                International Collaboration
* KSG assesses that Trump is likely to avoid broad international collaboration on critical minerals, favoring bilateral agreements over comprehensive initiatives or free trade agreements (FTA). Trump is unlikely to support the MSP, casting uncertainty over its future. Trump is also unlikely to prioritize the 2022 MOU with the DRC and Zambia, which aims to build a complete cobalt and copper value chain, which would likely require significant private-sector investment from battery and EV manufacturers in the U.S., EU, Japan, or South Korea—a move Trump is unlikely to emphasize.
* Instead, Trump is likely to support investments by Gulf nations, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in African mining operations and infrastructure projects for mineral transport and export. These Gulf countries act as relatively neutral players in the U.S.-China competition for African critical minerals, offering financing, trade infrastructure, and potential future [refining](https://www.lithiumtitan.com/) capabilities. KSG assesses that Trump would likely endorse Gulf sovereign wealth funds acquiring African critical mineral assets to counter Chinese influence, building on initiatives such as the Biden administration’s 2024 effort to facilitate the sale of DRC copper assets to Swiss trader Mercuria.
* Trump is likely to prioritize narrower bilateral agreements with key critical mineral suppliers, avoiding the broader commitments of FTAs. Argentine President Javier Milei has expressed interest in pursuing an FTA with the U.S., potentially paving the way for a more limited partnership aimed at reducing U.S. dependence on Chinese-processed lithium—an initiative likely supported by Musk, who has ties to Milei and an interest in diversifying Tesla’s lithium supply. Similarly, Indonesia, the world’s [largest](https://www.knightsbridgesg.com/post/assessing-indonesian-nickel-production-associated-geopolitical-rivalry-and-wider-effects-october) nickel producer, has shown interest in a bilateral trade agreement with the U.S. akin to [Japan’s](https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/100096004.pdf) arrangement. Such a deal could enhance U.S. access to Indonesian nickel and cobalt, reducing Chinese dominance in these sectors. However, Indonesia’s insistence on local refining requirements may pose challenges during negotiations. sector. However, Indonesia’s insistence on [local refining](https://setkab.go.id/en/govt-committed-to-stop-raw-material-exports/) may complicate negotiations. 

# Most Likely Scenario in 12 Months (December 2025):

* The Trump administration will have imposed tariffs on critical mineral imports from China.. Domestic critical mineral projects will be advancing at a faster pace, supported by price protection and increased investment driven by reduced competition from lower-cost imports. However, Chinese retaliation through critical mineral export restrictions will be beginning to impact the domestic production of renewable energy technologies—such as EVs, batteries, and wind turbines—as well as essential military equipment, highlighting the strategic importance of expanding U.S. supply chain resilience.
* The Trump administration will have repealed EV tax credits, reducing U.S. EV sales and causing the U.S. to lag further behind China in the transition to EVs. This disproportionately hurts Ford and GM, which face higher costs transitioning to EV production, while Tesla capitalizes on its EV-only model to gain market share from legacy automakers.
* The Trump administration will be accelerating permitting processes on federal lands, unlocking new opportunities for mineral extraction.. Trump will have reversed Biden’s ban on copper mining in Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Area, winning Republican support but igniting significant backlash from environmental activists. Despite the controversy, Trump will press forward with mining initiatives, resisting pressure from advocacy groups. Trump will also have side-lined environmental litigation challenging Biden’s permit for the Rhyolite Ridge lithium deposit in Nevada, paving the way for mining operations to proceed.
* Under Musk’s leadership, the DOGE will be streamlining and centralizing mining regulations, reducing the influence of state and local authorities and creating a more favorable regulatory environment.
* With financial support, reduced regulatory burdens, and protection through tariffs, the U.S. mining sector will be attracting greater private sector investment. Investors will be betting on long-term growth in critical mineral demand and an eventual price recovery, boosting the sector’s trajectory.
* KSG anticipates that China, which dominates the refining of critical minerals, would likely retaliate against U.S. tariffs by imposing export restrictions on these materials—a tactic it has previously [employed](https://english.mofcom.gov.cn/News/PressConference/art/2023/art_36fb2d80e4b4453891bb8fc83e2b3c4e.html). Given the U.S.'s heavy reliance on China for critical minerals—especially REE essential for defense technologies—such measures could significantly disrupt the manufacturing of key equipment including permanent magnets (used in wind turbines, EVs, and military applications such as weapon systems and precision guided munitions). KSG assesses that such retaliatory moves would likely increase incentives for the incoming Trump administration to prioritize and expedite the development of domestic critical mineral mining and processing operations, ultimately eroding China’s market share, supply dominance, and pricing power.

# JUST HOW BIG IS THE DEPOSIT? See Responses to Direct Questions posed to Jim Sims!)

# ON 5/27/2022 Jim: How Does Niocorp's Elk Creek Project compare to other ""World Class Projects?""

**REPSONSE:**

*""* ***It is a bit tricky to compare rare earth projects on an apples-to-apples basis, which is why we chose to limit the comparison of our Elk Creek resource to other REE projects in the U.S. There are several reasons why.For one, there are several different legal systems that determine how a project can measure and disclose aspects of its mineral resource and/or reserve. For public companies that are SEC-reporting entities (such as NioCorp), the SK1300 standard must be followed. For public companies regulated by Canadian authorities (also such as NioCorp), there is the National Instrument 43-101 disclosure standard. In Australia, there is the JORC standard. Each of these systems differ in what they allow, or don't allow, in terms of public disclosure of mineral resources and reserves. This can lead to 'apples-to-oranges' comparisons among projects.Another challenge in making such comparisons is the mineralization of an REE project. Some projects can show a high ore grade of rare earths, but the mineralization of the ore is something that is very difficult to process. For example, rare earth projects based on silicate-based minerals -- such as eudialyte -- are extraordinarily difficult to economically process in order to pull the REEs out and separate them. Others can contain relatively high levels of other impurities, such as naturally occurring radioactive elements, that can increase the cost of processing. A high ore grade doesn't mean a lot if the REE mineralization isn't amenable to processing that is technically or economically infeasible. This is why only a small handful of the more than 200 REE-containing minerals have ever been successfully processed economically at commercial scale. (The two primary REE-containing minerals in the Elk Creek Project, bastnasite and monazite, are among those that have been successfully processed for decades).Rare earth resources also differ in terms of the relative distribution of individual REEs in the host mineral. Some may have a relatively high ore grade but also have high percentages of less valuable REEs, such as cerium or lanthanum or yttrium. Others have lower ore grades but their REE mineralization is skewed more favorably to higher-value REEs, such as the magnetics neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium which are used in NdFeB magnets. There are several other REEs that are also magnetic, such as samarium, but those are of lower value. Another way that REE projects are compared to one another is through a so-called “basket price.” This is a particularly misleading way of valuing a rare earth play, in my opinion, because a project’s ‘basket price’ assigns a dollar value to the individual REEs in the ore, multiplying total tonnes of each REE by current market price for that REE, and combines them all together. This assumes that a project will produce each and every one of the REEs in the ‘basket’ (which is almost never the case). It also ignores the enormous CAPEX and OPEX required to produce 14 or so individual REEs. There are yet other factors that help determine the viability of a potential rare earth project***

***.\~Some projects*** ***are aimed at only producing rare earths. That means that they are relatively riskier investments than projects that are designed to produce multiple products in addition to rare earths.***

***\~Some projects that are relatively large in size, have high ore grades, and are comprised of processable minerals -- but they are located in places that make mining and processing difficult or very expensive. I can think of a few projects that are touted as attractive deposits but are located near or above the Arctic Circle, which generally makes mining more costly.***

***\~ Others are located in places where there local residents, such as First Nations communities in Canada or anywhere in Greenland, can readily block a project from moving to commercial operation. Still others are in countries where local governments are less stable than in the U.S., or are simply prone to corruption, which exposes the project to high country risk.***

***\~Many REE projects are proposed by teams that have no experience in commercially processing REEs. They tend to gloss over that fact. Knowing what I know about the challenges of producing separated, high-purity REEs, this is one of the most important factors I consider when I look at REE projects. But that is just my opinion. A more useful comparison strategy for investors is to look at rare earth projects through multiple lenses, such as those I describe above. It is not easy to do this if one doesn’t have a pretty deep understanding of the REE industry and the challenges of successfully making these strategic metals. Having said all of that, it’s clear that our Elk Creek carbonatite is very large and similar in total contained rare earths to some of the largest known rare earth resources in the world, including the Araxa carbonatite in Brazil and the St. Honore carbonatite in Quebec.***

Sooo... it is a long story, yet the short version of it is that I met this guy in uni. We met as classmates, talked, and had deep discussions about our opinions, beliefs, morals, etc. We klicked! Yes, it took time and effort, yet all was worth it. He told me one day that he'll be going to the US for an exchange semester, and it'll take 6 months. I was so happy for him! I wished him all the best, prepared a checklist so he doesn't end up forgetting anything. We went on a date, where he was about to answer an important question that I've asked, but I told him to wait till he comes back from the US, for I do have this little fear that he might change once he goes there. Which I received a promise from him that this would never happen! 

He travelled, it had already been 3 months, and our communication was still superb! Yes, we didn't call a lot, for we wanted to focus on our uni's too, but we chatted a lot. Comes month 4 (November), and my birthday is here, he called me, we talked, had a really beautiful yet intimate call with another promise that once he's back, this situationship will turn into an official relationship.... until mid November, when he started talking about another female friend of his, he met recently in one of his classes. And to my surprise, they cooked together (3 times, when he only told me about this event taking place once), she picks him up and drops him off every Saturday/Sunday to the temple (she's Buddhist, though he's not. And when I asked him about it, he said he likes the atmosphere there and it's so relaxing and nice. Which i was fine with, too). not only that, but he and his roommates where supposed to go on a road trip, but because it got cancelled due to personal reasons, he and this girl ended up booking a flight to Hawaii and will be staying there for couple of days in a ""shared apartment with 2 different beds and a kitchen"" ... nope, wait. I'm not done yet... he even told me that last week,  he went to the temple and came back immediately, yet the girl literally posted a picture of him, playing with her dog with this comment :🥹🥹🥹""... and 2 days ago, he told me that he bought a Christmas gift for himself ( which is a suit ) and that he'll send me a picture once he wears it. Guess what!?🤡 the girl posted another 📸 yesterday of them together in a party, where she was wearing a beautiful pink jumpsuit and he's there with his suit, hand on her back, and they look like a beautiful couple👏🏻... 

In these 11 months, we only had one argument, which was about the shared room topic... I told him that you can not seriously think it is okay to share a room with a girl you just met 1 month ago! While it took you 6 months to even invite me for coffee! But anyways, the argument was heated and I didn't want to make it last for long, so I sat with myself, reflected, and thought maybe im taking things a bit too seriously, maybe it's the difference in cultures that it making me have such ideas... so I compromised and solved the problem. We were back, fine, talking, chatting, flirting, etc. It all went smooth, until now... where I get this message after telling him that I missed him ( because he had another road trip with his friends, then had exams for two weeks, so we couldn't talk properly for 3 weeks, which again, I was okay with and supported his time with his roommates aka. Friends).... I kept seeing new things, like him forgetting his promises ( promised me to send a postcard since my birthday in Nov, asked him about it twice, and each time he'd promise me again that he'd send it and forgets... ), he doesn't show any more interest in our conversations, he takes longer to reply with the excuse that he has a full schedule and that's why he can only replies at night ( well, even I am busy. Even i have a full uni schedule. But somehow I'm still able to find time for you. Always..). And now comes this message:

""My name"" I feel like over the past weeks I wasn’t able to give you back what you wanted from me.

( I deleted a paragraph here, because it wasn't that informative)

Something happened inside myself, yes. Was it expected?
Yes. Would I recommend doing what I did and do it again? Yes of course. But the man you know has still the morals and beliefs as before. Some of them even much stronger.

But I can’t present myself now the way I was and you don’t want me to lie to you neither.


--------------------

What does he mean with he can't present himself now the way he was??

Before, when I told him that I missed him, he'd say it back. But now, even after I sent him a lengthy message, he didn't even say it. Completely ignored it, and instead sent me this...

Is he over me...? Did he actually change but is denying it...?",2,1734785216.0,LongDistance,7,0.75,False
1hj95nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFinanceHub/comments/1hj95nq/jar_deciml_review_should_you_use_microsavings/,"Jar & Deciml Review: Should You Use Micro-Savings Apps to Save and Invest?
","In personal finance, we often hear the advice to ""save more"" and ""invest regularly."" But in a world filled with spending temptations, finding ways to put money aside for savings or investments consistently can feel overwhelming, especially for beginners.

This is where *micro-savings* come into the picture—tiny, almost effortless savings that accumulate over time without requiring us to make major changes in our spending habits.

But is micro-savings really the revolutionary tool it’s marketed to be?

In this post, we’ll explore what micro-savings is, how apps like **Jar** and **Deciml** use this concept to help people save and invest, and whether using these apps is a good idea for your personal finance journey.

**What is Micro-Savings?**

Imagine saving money without even realising you're saving. Sounds magical, right?

That's precisely what micro-savings is all about. It is a concept where you save small amounts of money frequently, without feeling a significant pinch in your day-to-day finances. 

Instead of setting aside large chunks of money every month, micro-savings encourage you to save small amounts consistently—maybe just ₹10 or ₹20 at a time. Over time, these small amounts add up and help build a savings corpus.

Think of it like putting your loose change into a piggy bank every day. At first, it might not seem like much, but eventually, you will notice the piggy bank is filled with a significant amount.

*The idea is to make saving as seamless and automatic as possible, so you hardly notice the effort.*

**How do Micro-Savings Apps like Jar and Deciml Work?**

Now, let’s talk about how apps like Jar and Deciml have leveraged this concept of micro-savings to help you save and invest money without much effort.

**1. Jar – Digital Gold with Every Spare Change**

Jar is a micro-savings app that rounds off your daily transactions and invests the spare change into **digital gold**. For example, if you buy something for ₹38, Jar rounds the amount to ₹40 and the ₹2 difference is saved and invested in gold.

Jar’s approach is simple and revolves around making gold more accessible to the everyday person. Gold has long been seen as a haven asset, particularly in India, where many consider it a strong investment option to preserve wealth. With Jar, you don’t need a large sum to start; even your spare change is enough to build a small gold investment over time.

**2. Deciml – Round-Off Savings for Mutual Funds**

Deciml is another micro-savings app, but instead of gold, it helps users invest their spare change in **mutual funds**. Like Jar, Deciml rounds off every purchase you make to the nearest 10 and invests the difference.

For example, if you buy a coffee for ₹45, Deciml rounds it off to ₹50 and invests the ₹5 into a mutual fund. Currently, the app allows you to select between two regular mutual funds of Navi - Aggressive **Hybrid** Fund and **Large** & **Midcap** Fund.

The idea behind both these apps is to make saving and investing easier by automating small amounts that users won’t miss. By rounding up every transaction, they turn spare change into actual investments.

They also allow you to set aside and invest a small amount every day, week or month.

**Do Micro-Savings Really Have a Long-Term Impact?**

At first glance, the amounts being saved through these apps might seem insignificant—₹2 here, ₹5 there. It’s natural to wonder if such small amounts can make any difference in the long run. So, let’s break down the potential impact of micro-savings.

**1. Consistency Over Time**

The key to micro-savings is consistency. Even if you're saving just ₹20 a day, that adds up to ₹7,300 in a year. Over time, that small change becomes a habit, and the regularity of saving (no matter how small) can accumulate into a decent sum.

In fact, this is one of the most important principles in personal finance—regular savings, no matter the amount, lead to wealth creation over time.

**2. The Power of Compounding**

In both apps, the spare change is invested, which means that not only are you saving, but your money is also growing. Thanks to compounding, even small investments can grow into significant amounts if left to grow over time. Compounding works best when given time, so starting early—even with small amounts—can be very powerful for long-term wealth creation.

For example, if you save just ₹20 a day and invest it in a mutual fund that gives an average return of 12% per annum, over 10 years, you could accumulate around ₹1,50,000. This is the magic of compounding, where your returns start earning returns.

**3. Behavioral Benefits**

One often overlooked benefit of micro-savings is that it encourage a saving habit without feeling like a sacrifice.

When you use apps like Jar and Deciml, you get accustomed to the idea of saving or investing small amounts with every purchase. This can eventually lead to better financial habits in the long run, as you become more mindful of your spending and savings.

**Should You Use Micro-Savings Apps or Save Manually?**

Now comes the key question—should you rely on apps like Jar and Deciml for micro-savings, or would it be better to save and invest manually?

**1. Ease and Automation**

The biggest advantage of these apps is the convenience and automation they provide. They remove the need for you to actively think about saving or investing, as they do the work for you every time you make a transaction.

If you’re someone who finds it hard to set aside money or tends to forget to save, these apps are a good way to make sure you're at least saving something.

**2. Small Savings Without Disruption**

For those with tight budgets or irregular incomes, these apps allow you to save without disrupting your cash flow too much. Since the amounts are small and tied to your regular spending, you won’t feel a significant impact on your day-to-day finances, yet you’ll still be building a savings habit.

**3. Investing with Little Capital**

One of the biggest challenges many beginners face is the misconception that you need a large sum of money to start investing. Micro-savings apps like Deciml break this myth by allowing you to invest as little as ₹10 into mutual funds. This can be a great starting point for people who are hesitant to start investing because they think they don’t have enough money.

**4. Limited Scope**

While these apps make saving and investing easier, it’s important to recognize that the amounts being saved are quite small.

If your long-term financial goals are big, such as buying a house or building a retirement corpus, relying solely on micro-savings won’t be enough. You will still need to supplement these small savings with regular, more significant contributions towards your financial goals.

**DIY Approach: Is It Better?**

If you're someone who already has a disciplined saving habit, you might not need these apps. You can manually transfer small amounts to your savings or investment account every month.

With a DIY approach, you have more control over how much you save and where you invest, but it requires a higher level of discipline and consistency. You won’t have the automation that micro-savings apps offer, so you’ll need to be proactive in setting aside money regularly.

**Final Thoughts**

If you find it challenging to save consistently or struggle to set aside money each month, apps like Jar and Deciml can be useful tools to automate your savings and gradually build a small investment portfolio.

However, keep in mind that these apps are not magical solutions. They simply apply the concept of micro-savings, which you can implement on your own with a bit of discipline.

That said, the investment options offered by Jar and Deciml are not necessarily the best. Jar invests in digital gold, which isn’t an ideal investment. Deciml offers two regular mutual funds from Navi, and regular funds typically come with higher fees compared to direct funds.

Additionally, when registering for Jar, you may be asked to grant access to your **CIBIL** report, which suggests they might offer you loans in the future. This is something to be cautious about, so it’s best not to rely solely on these apps for your financial needs.

You can consider using these apps initially if you're struggling to save and invest consistently. But as you become more confident and disciplined, it's advisable to gradually take control of your own investments for better flexibility and long-term growth.",1,1734785198.0,IndianFinanceHub,0,1.0,False

Thank you so much for finding some time to check out a project we’ve been working on for a while now: coffeedrippd. We are still making improvements, but we are excited to share it with you!  
  
At its core, the idea of coffeedrippd is that coffee beans are as complex and varied as beer and wine, yet there aren’t nearly as many resources dedicated to coffee. There are around 2,500 coffee roasters in the United States, but there isn’t a reliable list of those roasters anywhere. We have put together that list and have taken it a step further; our goal is to database every coffee bean offered from every roaster. We currently have nearly 20,000 different coffees listed on [coffeedrippd.com](http://coffeedrippd.com), all available to browse, search, filter (by origin, roast level, flavor notes, state, and more), and purchase directly from the roaster’s website. We think it’s a step up from browsing through some old bags of coffee on a supermarket shelf. coffeedrippd does not use affiliate links; any purchase made is made directly with the roaster.  
  
coffeedrippd is soft launching to our friends and family. If you'd like a registration code, please DM us. Upon registration, you'll receive five referral codes (found under ""My Account""). Use them if you'd like! Your friends and family are our friends and family.  
  
Our focus is building a useful (and free) platform for roasters and users. If any roasters are interested in discussing our plans and providing feedback on how we can help them, please feel free to reach out!  
  
Thank you again for your time and support. We are truly thankful and hope you have a wonderful and relaxing holiday season!",1,1734785190.0,coffeedrippd,0,1.0,False

    I wanna make it short so i am gonna say that of course i go out to do shoppings and i get paid to study by the government now with 7 other guys in a very tiny class so I don't have to work at all or interact with anyone, except those 1 and a half hours per day from Monday to Friday. Now its christimas here and the class is closed and i see that i just can't really do it but may i can, if i lose that ""lonely"" battle may i go crazy or may i improve my self cus thats all i do for months: gym, study "" a lot of studying mostly philosophy and sociology"" and sleep... Even when i go out i put on my headphones and i listen to music while im drinking my coffee alone and with a book in my hands. 

    I wanna speak, i wanna love and i wanna care its like a need... Im lucky that I'm an attractive 24years old male ""also did modeling for a while"" and women were never a problem for me to have mostly they approach me in the most random places and they want sex or smth. But again that's not what i want from a woman, i wanna feel, i wanna fight for a relationship and i want to sacrifice. 
  
 Anyways guys all i wanna say is that this isolation is fucking me hard but i can stand physical or emotional pain and smile on top of that. I just don't know in the long term if that's gonna destroy me and go somewhat insane or i will actually get used to it and find myself so therefore i can improve even more! 

  Can you identifed to that? Have you ever experienced it or even though of it? What did you learn by going in an isolated state in purpose?

The Tallegra HMD spec is Tempato-Hermes' Motorsports Division first prototype track car. It features a mid-mounted 2.2 liter V8 engine. The setup demands respectful technique, as the powerplant's inertia makes for nuanced handling that may prove difficult to novice drivers.

Smooth throttle and braking application are a must, including the transition between those two states of thrust. The result is a highly rewarding drive, a feeling akin to taming a lion.

Da back backstory:

Holy shit dude. Getting this thing to not kill me was a fuckin journey yo. It's my first mid-engine car, so I had like ZERO clue how to tune the handling characteristics.

We both just transferred in our university that year, he sat at the back row. A week in, I noticed that he is an introvert - I am as well, but I'm able to make few interactions with our classmates by this time however, he's been the type who stays at his place, sits on his chair - eyes locked on his phone screen.

To cut the story short, we eventually became friends ; Best friends. We started shs together, graduated together. At this point I already met his family. We entered the same university for college, passed our entrance exams and qualifying exams (We were BSAccountancy students). Our blockmates thought and would insist that we were lovers. We'll laugh it off and claim that we were just best friends & very platonic. We were inlove / each other's soulmate and everyone knows that except us as they say. 

His mom loved me, would send me gifts (Christmas gift, birthday, valentines & a lot of random gifts too),invite to dinners. Would initiate chitchats, looked after me when I was sick - even bought me my vitamins and fruits. I guess it's safe to say his mom too assumed we were lovers. 

Our blockmates were convinced as well that we were not just best friends specially they were aware as well of how his mom treats me because they'll see him time to time bringing gifts / foods that his mom sent me. They would also often here me talking to his mom over the phone. (asking for his whereabouts, ranting about his silly behaviors, inviting to dinner etc) 

We passed all qualifying exams together, on our last and final qualifying year - I noticed that something changed or maybe after all the banters from everyone around us about us being couple, we finally realized too that we were never just friends. 


But as clinche as it maybe having this confusions led to a very rough patch on our relationship as best friends, partners in crime. We were on a push on pull set up, both afraid to actually cross the line because we were terrified to lose the friendship we built over time. 

We were 22, finally graduating BSA together (juz how his mom wished we make it together when we were freshmen). Few days before our graduation we had the chance to actually say our appreciation for each other. Being each other's back bone since we were 16. 


We also realized that we never really had a clear discussion of what actually happened between us. In the end we came in agreement that though we never said anything to each other ; we both know a lot of things left unsaid. Our hearts understood each other. 


Ended it with us choosing our friendship. Forever grateful for the love shared (2016-2022). We rather cherish it that way instead of risking it and losing both the love and friendship. 

Sometimes, if you want someone to stay in your life ; you have to keep them as your friend. 

To this day, we are now both working professionals and still friends. I wrote this cause we recently had a catch up coffee hang out with our circle (shs). 

It's like a lot has changed but nothing has changed at the same time. Suddenly, I remembered who we were during our younger years. I'm glad we chose to remain friends because It's always just a beautiful memory to look back on (tho, the decision itself during that time was a total hear break.)

It's quite big, so we kept most of our frozen foods in there. A few months ago, the electricity went out for a week or so, and we had literally no where to put the butt load of meats in there. When we opened it to clean out all the rotten food, we realised that the pork had not only spoiled, but leaked its rot fluids into the melting ice. If you've never smelt rotting pork, it smells like what you'd expect to smell if you found a dead body decomposing in a sewage pipe. The smell was so bad that my mother threw up. We were all gagging and crying, and what made it worse was that our kitchen/living room/dining room are an open concept space. There was no way to isolate the smell to one room, so it just filled up most of the house 

Now, we made a stupid. We were too scared to open the fridge after that debacle, so we just let it sit for a while. It got to a point where the smell would leak out even if the fridge was closed. That's when we decided to just suck it up and clean. We dragged it out to the outside tap and cleaned it with any and every cleaning product in the house (not mixing them. Obviously). The smell remained. We put lemons in there. The smell remained. We put a cup of coffee and a cup of vanilla essence. The smell remained. We put charcoal in there. The smell remained. We even boiled up some cloves and dumped the juice in there, yet the smell still lingers. Its not so bad that we can't open the freezer, but we can't put food in there.

I was diagnosed with Crohn’s 10 years ago (originally with ulcerative colitis lol) and my life has been quite normal with few ups and downs. I take mesalamine on a daily basis (1600mg x 4) and Zoloft (100mg), don’t eat meat and don’t drink coffee.
Last month I got some pretty bad upper respiratory stuff, which lasted for weeks and after some tests and xray my doctor prescribed me some antibiotics (don’t remember the name unfortunately, started with K). They worked okay and I got better, but during antibiotics (took them for a week) I had a bad diarrhea, which I was actually ready for and I did not mind it. I also had a period during this time so this also contributed a bit to feeling a bit under the weather and tired. My doctor said that the diarrhea should go away on it’s own after a few days after taking meds. Now it’s been almost a month and I’ve never had this kind of a flare-up. 
Mostly my symptoms are that I am constantly bloated, stomach making noises, unnormally loud sounds when going to bathroom (sorry if tmi), blood and mucus in stool, diarrhea like consistency, but at the same time feeling constipated/not fully emptied bowel and worst of them all - really bad urgnency, which I’ve never ever had before. It has lastef about a month and I am really worried, also called my gastroenterologist and did stool samples, which showed some irregular numbers, but not that bad. 
Now with the christmas coming I am really worried since I am afraid to eat and dine (usually I need to use bathroom after eating, but since there are some unpleasant noises, I am really anxious to do it and I’d rather starve than embarrass myself when visiting family members etc). I don’t know what to do, the sounds, the blood and the urgency worry me the most, but I’ve tried different diets/eating habits, nothing seems to help, one of my national foods is kefir, which sometimes helps, but not too much. I also take probiotics, which are okay I guess, but do not have a bigger effect. I am worried and sad, anxious and embarrased.

### Before You Start House Sitting

Preparation is key. The following steps can help ensure a safe and smooth experience:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Meet the Homeowner:** Arrange a face-to-face meeting with the homeowner before the job. Discuss responsibilities, and feel free to ask questions about the home, pets, and neighborhood.
- **Understand the Property:** Take the time to learn about the layout of the home. Know where important things are, such as the fire extinguisher, first-aid kit, fuse box, and emergency exits.
- **Gather Contact Information:** Have the homeowner's contact information, as well as a list of trusted neighbors, in case of emergencies.
- **Review Safety Protocols:** Ask the homeowner about the security system, including alarms, cameras, and locks. Understand how to operate them properly.

### Stay Alert to Your Surroundings

Being aware of what's happening in and around the home can improve your safety significantly. Consider the following:

- **Know the Neighborhood:** Familiarize yourself with the neighborhood. Identify key locations, such as local police stations, grocery stores, and hospitals.
- **Be Mindful of Strangers:** If someone comes to the door, don't hesitate to ask questions before allowing them in. Trust your instincts—if something feels off, it’s okay to deny entry.
- **Limit Sharing Information:** Be cautious about discussing your house sitting job openly, especially on social media. Sharing details may inadvertently attract unwanted attention.

- **Care for Pets Wisely:** If you’re caring for pets, ensure they are secure and safe. Make sure their food and water are easily accessible, and check on them regularly.

### In Case of Emergency

Even with careful planning, emergencies can happen. Here’s how to handle them:

- **Stay Calm:** If something unexpected occurs, try to remain calm. Assess the situation and determine if you need to contact the homeowner or emergency services.
- **Have an Emergency Plan:** Prepare for different scenarios, such as fire, power outages, or sudden illness. Know how to reach help quickly.
- **Document Incidents:** Keep a record of any incidents that happen during your stay. This can be helpful for the homeowner to know about when they return.

### After the House Sitting Period

Once the homeowner is back, part of your job includes a proper handover:

- **Conduct a Walk-Through:** Walk through the home with the homeowner. Check that everything is in order and that pets, if applicable, are happy and healthy.
- **Communicate Issues:** Be honest about any problems or concerns that arose during your stay. Transparency is key to maintaining trust.
- **Leave Feedback:** Providing friendly feedback can help the homeowner improve their home for future sitters, and it also opens a channel for communication.

Taking these precautions not only ensures your safety but also instills trust in the homeowner, making you more likely to receive future house sitting opportunities. By being prepared and aware, you create an environment that is safe for both you and the home.

Building Trust with Homeowners: Keys to a Successful House Sitting Experience
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you decide to become a house sitter, building trust with homeowners is essential to your success. House sitting isn’t just about watching over a property—it's about providing peace of mind for homeowners while they're away. Fostering a trusting relationship can make the difference in securing future opportunities. Here are key strategies to help you build that trust.

### Be Transparent From the Start

Honesty is crucial in establishing a trusting relationship. When communicating with homeowners, be clear about your skills, experience, and what you can offer. Mention any relevant background you have in caring for homes and pets. Being transparent can ease any concerns they might have.

- **Share Your Experience:** If you have prior house sitting experience, share those details. Highlight specific tasks you performed and any positive feedback you received.
- **Provide References:** Offer references from previous homeowners. This shows that others trust you, which can make potential clients feel more comfortable.

### Communicate Effectively

Regular and open communication can go a long way in building trust. Homeowners will appreciate staying updated while they're away. Make sure to check in with them at agreed intervals or whenever you notice something significant. Here’s how to maintain good communication:

- **Set Expectations:** Discuss how often you will provide updates and what information you'll include, such as pet care and property status.
- **Be Responsive:** If homeowners reach out to you, reply promptly. This shows that you value their concerns and are attentive.

### Show Respect for Their Home

Demonstrating respect for the homeowner’s property is paramount. This involves following any guidelines they set for their home. Here are some ways to show this respect:

- **Adhere to House Rules:** If homeowners have specific instructions, follow them diligently. This shows that you respect their wishes and home.
- **Maintain Cleanliness:** Keep the home tidy while you’re there. Clean up after yourself and leave the space as you found it.

### Get to Know the Homeowners

Establishing a personal connection can enhance trust. Take the time to get to know the homeowners before they leave. Use these strategies to create a bond:

- **Engage in Conversation:** Ask questions about their home and pets. This shows genuine interest and can help build rapport.
- **Listen Actively:** Pay attention to their concerns or requests. This demonstrates that you care and are invested in their peace of mind.

### Insurance and Safety Protocols

Assure homeowners that their property will be safe in your hands. Highlight any tools or safety measures you will implement, which can alleviate their fears. You can consider:

- **Obtaining Insurance:** If you aren't already insured, consider getting liability coverage for house sitting. This can protect both you and the homeowner.
- **Establishing Emergency Protocols:** Clarify how you plan to handle emergencies while they are away. Having a plan in place shows that you are proactive.

### Use Technology to Your Advantage

Today’s technology can help enhance trust between you and the homeowners. Video calls and messaging apps provide easy ways to communicate. Consider these tech tips:

- **Share Photos or Videos:** Send updates with pictures of their pets or home, so owners can see that all is well.
- **Utilize Home Security Apps:** If homeowners have a security system, offer to check in through their mobile app to help them feel secure.

Always express gratitude. Thank homeowners for the opportunity and always look for ways to make their experience better. The more trust you build, the more likely you are to be chosen for future house sitting gigs. Follow these steps, and you’ll not only be a successful house sitter but also a reliable friend for homeowners seeking peace while they’re away.

### Conclusion

House sitting offers a unique and rewarding opportunity to earn extra cash while providing valuable services to homeowners. By understanding the various avenues available, such as searching online platforms or connecting with your local community, you can easily find house sitting jobs near you. Essential skills like reliability, attention to detail, and strong communication not only enhance your chances of securing these gigs but also ensure a successful experience for both you and the homeowner.

Additionally, incorporating safety tips into your routine is crucial not just for your protection but also for the security of the home you're caring for. Familiarizing yourself with the property and having clear instructions will help prevent any mishaps. Trust is the backbone of a successful house sitting arrangement. Taking the time to build a rapport with homeowners, demonstrating your professionalism, and being transparent about your responsibilities can go a long way in establishing a solid connection.

As you embark on your journey into house sitting, remember that each job is not merely a way to earn extra cash but also an opportunity to meet new people and experience different environments. The right approach can lead to repeat opportunities and positive word-of-mouth referrals. By honing your skills and demonstrating reliability and care, you can turn house sitting into a fulfilling and profitable venture. So, get ready to step into a rewarding world where your services are not just needed, but truly appreciated.

The courthouse doors swung open with a creak, revealing a crowd of reporters, protesters, and curious onlookers. Among them, a figure stood clutching a worn leather notebook, their knuckles white from the grip. The verdict had been delivered—guilty. Justice, some said, but to this person, it was the beginning of chaos.

A sibling had been the star witness in a case that unraveled one of the city’s most corrupt schemes. A powerful real estate magnate had been siphoning public funds, leaving families like theirs destitute. The testimony had been damning, and now the witness was in protective custody.

“Can we have a word?” a journalist shouted, snapping the person out of their thoughts. They raised a hand to shield themselves from the camera flashes and shook their head. Words felt heavy, and besides, it wasn’t time to talk—not yet.

The figure slipped down the courthouse steps and into the shadowed alley where a friend waited in an idling car.

“Did they see you?” the friend asked as the door shut behind them.

“No,” came the reply, with eyes staring out the window. “But it doesn’t matter. They’ll find me eventually.”

The friend frowned but didn’t press further. They’d known each other long enough to recognize when minds were racing, piecing together threads no one else could see. The city was alive with tension. Protests erupted daily, factions formed, and whispers of retaliation echoed through every street corner.

Back at the apartment, a collection of documents was spread across a table—maps, letters, and photos. The testimony had put one person behind bars, but this was only the tip of the iceberg. Corruption ran deeper than anyone realized.

“What are you looking for?” the friend asked, pouring coffee into a chipped mug.

“Connections,” was the reply, eyes scanning a faded photograph of city officials at a gala. “That testimony took down one player, but someone bigger is pulling the strings. And I think I know where to start.”

The friend leaned over the table, squinting at the photo. “Isn’t that the mayor?”

A nod. “Exactly. They’re next.”

The sound of sirens outside jolted them both. The figure darted to the window, heart pounding. A black SUV idled across the street, its tinted windows reflecting the streetlights.

“They’re watching us,” came the whisper.

The friend set down the mug and grabbed a jacket. “Then let’s give them a reason to worry.”

A small smile broke through the tension. “You’re crazy.”

“Crazy enough to help you,” the friend replied. “Let’s finish what was started.”

And with that, the two stepped into the night, determined to expose the truth, no matter the cost.",1,1734783818.0,PolyClinic,0,1.0,False

My preferred mode of holiday travel to visit my family is by car rather than air.

**Bulky Trash Pick-up**
I called 311 and tried to submit a ticket. I told the worker that he needed to submit a ticket , please. 
He wouldn't because the regular trash would pick up these 2 couches. I knew they wouldn't. And sure enough they are still on the street. 

1 love seat and a large couch. Brown in color.

1hj8ok6,https://www.reddit.com/r/luxurycandles/comments/1hj8ok6/lohn_panettone_first_burn/,Lohn Panettone: First Burn,"Each morning, I burn a candle as I drink coffee and wake up.  This morning I decided to burn one of the candles I purchased from Lohn as part of my first order with the company.  Lohn's Panettone did not disappoint.  I knew this was going to be a special treat because I was impressed with them from opening the shipping box.  Nice cold throw, and now a soft but strong hot throw and it has only been lit for about 45minutes.

What is appealing to me about this candle is how different it is from other traditional Christmas candles that fall into one of the woodsy, mullled wine, gingerbread categories.  The websites description is spot on, ""Warm candied bread. Crisp citrus zest, richly sweet dried fruits, and deep amber rum warmed through with cozy vanilla and spicy ginger.""  Surprisingly, the dried fruits (dates?) are the first note and the amber rum smooths everything out nicely.  I am looking forward to the other candles in this order and this will definitely be on my list to repurchase next year.

My favorite 2024 holiday candles so far (in no particular order):

Talking about my face my weight how I look how no one would love me because “I’m a stupid fat fuckin cow” (word for word verbatim) so now I tell everyone I don’t like to be called out I don’t care if it’s joking or not but if I ask you to stop it then please stop it, when people don’t stop I just leave or disassociate til it’s time for me to leave said family thing or whatever. I told everyone that they remind me of my biological family who I hate (hate is a strong word but it’s the only one that explains how I feel about this) and that I don’t like it I don’t care if they like it I don’t care if it’s a “African American” thing to do that’s that just how African American families operate and that I don’t need to be so sensitive about it. I’m alone in the sense that I don’t have family I can call or a lot of friends however just because I’m alone doesn’t mean I don’t like it, I’ve been to therapy and I have for the most part worked on myself and healed as much as I can, now present time wise Pb keeps going after me keeps coming at me and when I don’t engage or I just leave she whines about how I’m so sensitive and this that and the third I already snapped at her 3 times each time not talking to her for months on end to show her that I’m serious about this boundary but as usual “the family” gets into it and then I’m made to look like the bad guy cause “apparently I can’t take a joke and I can’t be that sensitive when I’m part of the family” but this is just it I already told them that I don’t mind not being part of the family because they don’t respect me and my feelings, each time I said that “the family talks shit about I don’t need to be doing all that and that I’m doing too much” the thing is I wasn’t raised to be ghetto or hood my family was working class back in the 90’s living in New Jersey so I was raised to behave like a lady in public’s eye but be myself when around people like me I honestly think that Pb and her family are colorists because I’m very lightbright (iykykyk) like picture Spanish woman very very light like coffee that has a little bit of cream to it just to make it mix but thick rich Afro hair. I honestly think that because I don’t look like them or act like them that they don’t think I’m African American…………..would I be the asshole if I just cut this entire family off because they refuse to respect me and my boundary and make me feel like shit each time I stand my ground?
