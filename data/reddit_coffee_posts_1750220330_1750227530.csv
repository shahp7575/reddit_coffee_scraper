1le9x3w,https://i.redd.it/8z10gityom7f1.jpeg,Day 8 of turning characters into ice cream flavors: Toya Aoyagi,"
Intro from the last post: Lately I’ve found myself in a “making ice cream” phase, so I thought it could be fun to think outside the box a little bit and make one for each character. I’m not sure if I’ll get to all of them yet though. I want to capture these character's personalities and looks within each flavor- no artificial dyes though, because that makes my stomach churn really bad.

This one was kind of difficult, because Toya is my favorite character, so I didn’t want to fuck it up. I chose a classic flavor (chocolate) that could benefit from a new take on it, to reflect on him using his classical music skills in new, more modern styles. No offense to chocolate (or classical music), but I find it a bit boring. Anyways, just a chocolate base slowly turned into a mocha one (c’mon, it’s Toya, how can I not add some coffee element?) and from there I thought “how can I spice it up a little more.” Out came the German chocolate cake topping, and it ended up being a perfect fit- it’s nutty, it’s unique, but it’s still grounded in more traditional dessert and ice cream elements. I considered just a Vietnamese coffee flavor (too bitter), an earl gray flavor, and some kind of latte and cookie type ordeal- but I think what I came up with was overall more fitting. For the final reason… old people probably love Toya, and would love this ice cream.

I rate this flavor an 9.6, still partial to fruity flavors- but damn if I do love chocolate still. Not a big fan of nuts though. My dad rates it the same, which is shocking, because he’s the coconut monster.

This one I had to theory craft a little, chocolate ice creams tend to come out hard and dense. I curbed that outcome pretty well though, and this base has more cream compared to other bases, without any reduction. It’s about a 3:1 ratio now. I used three kinds of chocolate: bar, powder, and a ganache. The topping is walnuts, almonds, and coconut. I used just a touch of espresso and vanilla in here too, so I’d say this probably the most complex flavored ice cream yet (which again ties to Toya, my man has baggage.) The ice cream itself is very very creamy, with a subtle sweetness, but it’s grounded in more bitter flavors from the espresso and chocolate. This perfectly balances out with the crunchy and sweet caramel-like topping, which makes the entire thing not too sweet and have a lot of textural contrast. It has a bit of a bite through all the cream from the nuts. ",1,1750227507.0,ProjectSekai,0,1.0,False

We have two classes and for the first few years one rep per class. This shot up to two reps per class the past two years. 

The current reps were scouting for the next years reps via the WhatsApp group. For one class there were no volunteers. This then turned into a guilt trip edition via the WhatsApp group and then we were threatened with “if no volunteers we will place the names of the parents (mums) who haven’t done it into a hat and pick one out”. WTF?!!

We also get gas lit into the ease of repping between four reps it’s very minimal work, how we are ‘expected’ to be a rep during our child’s schooling time and that others who have done it once before are exempt even if they volunteered to do it again. 

The passive aggressive tone from the reps was immense. Most of us parents work - both mum and dad. I know for a fact that some of the parents including a couple of reps don’t work and / or have their school fees paid for by their in laws! 

And on a note about repping; the school send an email each week detailing the plan ahead so as busy parents we can diarise. The reps are creating solutions to problems that don’t even exist! And if you’re a lazy parent who can’t be bothered to read what’s happening the following week then that’s on you! We also have the privilege to donate towards a gift for the reps to say ‘thank you’. Thank you for a job that I do myself! The gift pot is currently at £400. So that’s £100 yo each yep for what exactly?

1le9ub7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongevityStacks/comments/1le9ub7/vitamin_b_for_hangovers_it_helps_but_heres_what/,"Vitamin B for hangovers? It helps, but here’s what you’re probably missing","Yeah, B vitamins get brought up a lot in hangover recovery threads. And to be fair—they *do* help. Alcohol depletes B1 (thiamine), B6, B12, etc., and those play a role in energy metabolism and liver support. But here’s the real question:

**Why is your system falling apart so hard after a few drinks in the first place?**

That’s where most “hangover vitamin” advice stops short.

**The deeper issue:**  
Alcohol is metabolized in two toxic steps—first into **acetaldehyde**, then into acetate. The first step is bad. The second step *requires NAD⁺*. If you’re low on NAD⁺ (which drops with age, stress, poor sleep, etc.), your liver can’t clear the poison fast enough. That’s when you get the nausea, headache, brain fog, anxiety, etc.

B vitamins might help with cofactor support. But they *don’t* restore NAD⁺—which is the actual metabolic bottleneck.

**What made the biggest difference for me:**  
I started taking OMRE NMN + Resveratrol after drinking. I wasn’t expecting much—just testing the NAD⁺ angle. But the shift was noticeable:

* Woke up without that wired-but-drained heart-pounding state
* Brain fog cleared before coffee
* Didn’t feel emotionally wrecked all day
* No weird gut crash or low blood sugar spiral

**Why it worked:**

* **NMN** → Direct NAD⁺ precursor = faster detox
* **Resveratrol** → Activates sirtuins = cell repair, inflammation control
* Vitamins = good backup
* NMN + Resveratrol = actual recovery system reboot

**Bottom line:**  
Vitamin B helps, but it’s not the main event. If you’re hitting your 30s+ and hangovers feel disproportionately brutal, it’s probably not just dehydration or nutrient loss—it’s cellular resilience. Rebuilding that with something like NMN + Resveratrol feels less like “biohacking” and more like giving your system what it was missing all along.

Anyone else moved past the standard hangover stacks and started using longevity protocols as recovery tools?",1,1750227210.0,LongevityStacks,0,1.0,False

I wasn’t even planning to stay for long. Just pick up a book and leave.

But then I saw her.

She was sitting near the window, sunlight falling softly on her face, playing with strands of her hair as she absentmindedly flipped through pages. I don’t know what pulled me in more — the calm on her face or the chaos she created inside me with just a glance.

For days, I kept visiting the same spot, hoping to steal more glances. Sometimes our eyes met, and sometimes she smiled — not the “formal” kind, but the one that feels like a secret.

One day, she walked up to me.

“I see you here often. Are you stalking me, or do you genuinely like books?” she whispered, her eyes teasing.

That moment — that one moment — was when I knew: I was in trouble.

What started as innocent glances turned into long coffee conversations, walks under the orange streetlights, and late-night phone calls where neither of us wanted to hang up first.

And one evening, under that very same library window, as the first monsoon raindrops kissed the earth, we kissed — soft, nervous, but full of stories untold.

Funny how life changes with just a stolen glance, doesn’t it?

1le9t4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1le9t4d/aita_not_refunding_my_ex_for_a_flight/,AITA: Not refunding my ex for a flight,"I (m26) was broken up nearly two months ago by my partner (f23) of 3.5 years. Sparing every relationship detail, we were drifting apart and she ultimately decided our issues were too big to even attempt any resolution. It ended with tears on both sides but I’ve been coming to peace with everything. 

All our belongings were divided up amicably as we lived together at the time. The last outstanding thing was a flight that I had booked 2 weeks prior to her decision to end things. She confirmed there was no reason to get insurance (silly I know) before making the purchase. [Potentially helpful context: The first Sunday of every month I would treat us to a coffee house date just to have an intentional discussion on how we were doing as people and with the relationship. Not even a week before buying the flight she told me she was very happy with no issues.]

She mentioned paying for her half, around $500, and I promised I would try to get a refund but if not, could give her a printed pass should she want to go on the trip without me. We agreed and I was paid. Fast forward and roughly a week later her mom texts me calling me selfish and ungrateful for effectively stealing her daughter’s “hard earned money” after she’s been through so much. At the advice of literally everyone I know, I blocked the family and moved on. I did text my ex, who at this point we were on decent enough terms, to inform her what happened and that if she feels taken advantage then we can absolutely talk it out to resolve things.

Fast forward again and today at work I received a call from a semi-familiar number. Thinking it was a client, I answered and was treated to a tirade from her aunt about how I’m robbing her niece. Her aunt refused my request to pause the conversation until I could call back after work and, most importantly, did not ever have my number. With things escalating, I unblocked my ex’s mom to say that I would give them whatever documentation proving I did not secretly get a refund but would not be giving back the money.

I find it extremely inappropriate that I have still not heard any type of complaint from my ex and that her family keeps trying to throw things from our relationship at me to justify that I am acting unethical.  Her family and I got along decently enough during the relationship but it was entirely forced on my end: I found them very narcissistic (as did she) and it was one of those insurmountable issues that ended things.

Picking up where I left off, I sent him a card and a text that I'd be here if he ever needed to discuss the diagnosis. He ended up replying not too long after, he was definitely hesitant to talk, given I was supposedly a close friend of his ex-fiancee. 

Fast forwarding to a few weeks later, he asked if I'd heard anything from Reagan (his ex), I didn't really want to relay my conversation with her because she'd said absolutely nothing kind about him or the situation, so I told him that I'd spoken to her about the situation and decided that I didn't want to stay in contact with her. He invited me over for coffee to talk about it, and the evening definitely didn't go how I expected.

He told me the diagnosis had been hard on him (as expected) and we kind of talked that over for a bit, later on, the conversation switched to the topic of Reagan. He'd taken the break-up hard, obviously, but what I learned after that was absolutely insane.

He told me that they'd been saving for their wedding since he'd proposed (which had been just under a year before she left him), they'd set up a generous savings fund for the wedding (they were planning on having multiple weddings because they're different ethnicities, so the weddings included weeks of celebrations, plus honeymoon funds and enough for a downpayment on a new apartment), the fund had a generous sum of money. Granted that Reagan was finishing her masters, she hadn't provided much to the fund, so he'd been the one who had put most of the money in. After she left, he found out that nearly the entire fund had been drained. Reagan had not only left him while he was newly diagnosed with cancer, she basically stole his money.

He also explained that as messed up as her actions were, it would be hard to go after her, given the funds went to a joint account where both of them had equal claim to the money. There wasn't a contract drawn with any stipulations about how the funds would be divided if they broke up, so it would be difficult to hold her legally liable for her actions.

I was mindblown. I knew Reagan was self-centered but this was an insane low, even for her. She blocked him on every channel of communication and according to him, she hadn't been at home since their break-up. 

I wasn't sure how to offer assistance, but I did connect him with my lawyer. 

I'm lowkey considering breaking my No Contact with Reagan, if only to find out how on Earth she not only managed to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars and disappear and why she thought it was remotely okay to do it.

I drink a lot of tea — matcha especially — and I often had no idea how much caffeine I was actually getting throughout the day. That made sleep tricky. Add some milk, and I wasn’t sure if I was still within my carb limit either.

So I made this:

🧮 A free caffeine & milk carb calculator for tea and keto

* Pick your drink (matcha, hojicha, sencha, etc.)
* Enter how much you had
* It calculates caffeine, theanine, chlorophyll, fiber — and milk carbs if you added milk
* No signups, no ads — just on my site, because I needed it and thought others might too.

Totally free.  Hope it’s helpful! Let me know what I should add next.",1,1750226598.0,ketorecipes,1,1.0,False

1le9m40,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1le9m40/black_humour_punchline_only_cptsd_folk_will/,Black Humour Punchline only cptsd folk will understand ;),"**Long story if you’re bored enough to read.**  
A while back for some reason my scary adventure story came up in counselling, thus:  
Some time between Covid lockdowns, I was alone at work, carrying stuff into a shipping container used for storage. Just at the precise moment I stepped inside, (before you could say “reportable workplace incident,”) -**BAM!**\- the door slammed shut behind me, actually hit me on the arse, and I was trapped before I could prop the door open with the plank I kept just inside the door- the first thing I would usually do... *for safety*.  
At first I thought that maybe somebody had sneaked up behind me and shut me in as a bad taste prank, but after those first few hopeful, horrified moments I had to face the fact that if someone *had* locked me in, well, they weren’t coming to say “ha ha, only joking” any time soon. In hindsight, it must have been a freak gust of wind which slammed that heavy door shut.  
I banged on the walls for a while (with my safety plank) shouting for help, hoping someone might hear me. I knew that occasionally people walk past the container on their way around the worksite. If somebody came within range, they’d hear me. But how would I know when someone was nearby? I wouldn’t hear them go past if they trod softly, only if they had heavy footsteps or spoke aloud. I decided to bang and yell for a time, then repeat the attempt every hour or so, and hope one of those bouts would coincide with someone being close enough to hear.  
I had no food or water. There was a light in there, but management had recently removed an internet connected laptop I once had inside, so no communication link to outside.  
I entered just after I had a 10am coffee to boost my work performance. Uh-oh, how long could my bladder hold out? I held on for as many hours as I could... but eventually, I had to pee. Terrified that somebody might open the door at that embarrassing moment, I peed on a box of old newspaper like a puppy. Now things were serious- if I did get rescued I would have to try and get rid of that litterbox as unobtrusively as I could. I knew if I was found dead in there, the pee would hardly matter, but oh god, please, don’t let me have to do the other thing, (the shameful thing,) in case I do get out alive!  
The whole time, I knew perfectly well that I **could** die a lingering painful death in there, (hysterical panicking thus entirely appropriate) but then again perhaps I **could** be rescued the next moment (hysterical panicking wildly unnecessary, and then I would feel foolish for having descended into hysterical panicking). Whenever you read about people who got trapped and found too late, that’s what the first day must’ve felt like for them. Also for those like me, who were trapped for a while, then rescued. You can’t know which one you’ll be, and that’s a real mindfuck.  
I became dehydrated and a bit dizzy. I knew there was a co-worker scheduled to come in 2 days. But what if he didn’t come??? He was elderly and confused. What if he got sick?  
I had signed the visitors book at the security gatehouse, so I hoped somebody might check at the end of the day and see that I hadn’t signed out again. There’s only a handful of signatures in that book each day, if they even glanced it would be obvious. But when I saw through the crack in the door that it was dark outside, I realised that nope, nobody noticed. I stopped bothering to shout.  
People who live alone like me can die long before anybody raises the alarm, a fact I was acutely conscious of the whole time I was inside. I didn’t need a Wells Fargo 2024 incident to heighten my awareness. I do have one friend, who phoned my home that night, but how was he to know I never made it back that day? How many days before he would suspect something was wrong? At night I got cold, so cold. Luckily it was a mild night but still, I only had a tshirt on. (When I got too hot that morning I had taken off my compulsory high vis vest, so one less layer. I didn’t mention that in the written incident report.) I tried to wrap myself up in newspaper & sheets of cardboard to keep warm, and get a few spells of sleep, but inevitably I had to get up often and walk around to keep warm.  
I remember dozing, and having the crazy mixed up dreamthought “if only I could slip out back to the office for a moment, I could get some water to bring back in here with me, then I wouldn’t be so thirsty while I wait to be rescued.”

The terrifying noises at night went bump… tap tap tap… screee-eeee-eeek. Presumably bird feet on the metal roof, and the scratching of tree branches, but of course it sounded like a creepy psycho murderer with knives, and would have even more so without a light on; I would undoubtedly be in a straitjacket now.

Finally,  
after 24 hours,  
a passing forklift driver heard my periodical banging and yelling for help. My hero! He was pretty shocked.  
If he hadn’t heard me, well, another lockdown was instigated2days later, and nobody from my organisation was allowed on site for months!  
After I told my counsellor this saga, she said “oh my god, were you traumatised?” and I replied, no, not really. She asked “well, why not?”  
and I told her truthfully:  
***“it’s because that’s the least of my problems.”***  
how we both laughed ;D :D :D

Somehow I end up sandwiched between their passive-aggressive love-hate drama every morning. But here’s where it gets weird, I think they’re all in cahoots. I saw the metro watchman nod at her the other day. Not a polite nod but more  like a “proceed with the plan” kind of nod. And that? That scared me. What are they all upto ? 

Also, has anyone else noticed the CCTV camera by the exit looks Haunted ? Like it’s been watching for too long and is now part of this weird conspiracy. I swear, everyone’s in on something.

It was a Tuesday when it all kicked off.

Figures, don’t it? Ain’t nothin’ good ever happens on a Tuesday. One minute the world was watchin’ some trashy reality show called Real Housewives of Neo-Texas, and the next—bam—aliens.

Not like little green men landin’ in your backyard either. I’m talkin’ cold, hard math from space. First it was prime numbers, then Pi, then this weird floatin’ thing that looked like a rubik’s cube had a baby with a tornado. Came from just past somethin’ they call the Oort Cloud, which I guess is like the edge of the universe or somethin’.

Then, after a pause long enough to make everybody shift in their seats, this message came through, plain as day, in perfect English:

""Greetings, New Species. We welcome Humanity to the Galactic Concord. Please send a representative to coordinates 108.9 by minus 46.4 in four of your solar cycles. We look forward to a peaceful assimilation.""

No laser beams. No death rays. Just a real polite howdy-do and an invite that sounded a whole lot like they planned on takin’ us out for coffee and never bringin’ us back.

White House press lady dropped like a sack of feed.

NASA folks over in Florida  just stared for a bit until one of ‘em whispered, “Did they just say assimilation?” Three scientists chunked their coffee at the screen like that’d help.

Over in China, some general said somethin’ about how them Americans shouldn’t’a been beamin’ TikToks into the stars. Can’t say I blame him.

But in this half-dead bar out in Mojave County, Arizona, there was this fella—Colonel Jackson Briggs—just sittin’ there with a beer in one hand and the weight of the world in the other. Old war dog. Seen more hell than most. He looked up at the TV, took a slow swig, and said:

“…They ain’t ready.”

That’s when the countdown started.

Took two days for the bigwigs of Earth to cobble together somethin’ they called the Terran Coalition. Bunch of UN types, tech billionaires, and this real sketchy dude off Reddit who kept sayin’ he could “talk to crystals.” Took ‘em three weeks, seventeen lawsuits, two fistfights, and one shotgun wedding to decide who’d represent Earth.

Wound up pickin’ the only one dumb enough—or crazy enough—to raise his hand.

Colonel Briggs.

Fifty-four years old, built like a truck, bald as a cue ball, and missin’ an eye thanks to a drone mishap that involved a bottle of cheap bourbon. He once punched a bear and lived to tell about it. The bear, well... it ran.

They gave him a briefin’ folder thick as a Bible. He used it to prop up the leg of his poker table.

Sure enough, four years to the day, them aliens showed up. No fanfare. Just this big ol’ floatin’ spiral thing like a glass snail made outta stars, surrounded by bugs the size of tractors that shimmered like moonlight on water.

They landed at the Terran Spaceport in Patagonia. The big brains had rolled out the red carpet, literally. Even had three different high school bands playin’.

Briggs showed up late in a beat-up shuttle called Old Betsy, carryin’ a duffel bag, a steel spear he named ""Maggie"", and a flask that smelled like burnt corn.

He stepped out, looked at the floaty moth-aliens with their shiny cloaks and glitter wings, and just said:

“Name’s Jack. You boys ready to see what crazy looks like up close?”

The Concord’s drones—floatin’ up there in orbit—recorded everything. Then they updated their little alien notepad:

Species #9214: Human. Psychological Profile: Unstable. Cultural Tag: Probable Proto-Warlike. Risk Assessment: Under Review. Initial Contact Rating: …Pending.

And just like that, the fuse was lit.

I've been on this subreddit before but not much luck. Unfortunately most messages have about as much substance as the people behind them. I'm looking for long term friends and actual connections but I know that's a bit of a loaded request on here. I'm hoping we have things in common to talk about. A bit about me is I'm quite introverted. I enjoy a lot of quiet, creative hobbies like reading and journaling. I like old sitcoms and cartoons, I'm not huge on anime but I do read a few mangas. A quiet and slower lifestyle. I love visiting libraries, coffee shops, bookstores, thrift stores. It's a bit hard to find others like me because they're usually all hiding the same. I do love spending time with someone while just doing our own things, the company is very nice. I'll match your energy when it comes to messaging, I love to chat but I am shy at first. I'm pretty easy going but I am a bit of an old lady compared to most. I hope you know how to carry a conversation or show interest in it. If you're looking for a short conversation, I probably won't be a fun chat. Something a bit different to my other hobbies is I love paranormal and supernatural topics. I have some pretty odd, spiritual beliefs before we get to the conversation. I enjoy some video games but not huge on it. I love COD zombies, RDR2, Minecraft, The Sims, Infinity Nikki, and some others. I hope your message is a bit more than just a hi, hello. I'm 27 from Cali, open to anyone but keep it sfw. It would be great to make some girl friends, I hope I can find other women looking for genuine friends. It would be great if you're within a 6-8 hr time difference so its not so difficult but if we can make good friends, I'm sure we can make it work!

Here are some icebreakers:

* What do you enjoy watching?
* Do you believe in anything paranormal or supernatural?
* Do you collect anything?
* What's a deal breaker for you in a friendship?

1le9dwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dirona-albolineata/comments/1le9dwj/the_mountain_woman/,The Mountain Woman,"I was probably no older than five or six when my mom told me about The Mountain Woman for the first time. Mom had many stories, but she would never tell them at bedtime, and never around a campfire. She would tell them during bath time as a kid, or sometimes while she made dinner and I pretended to help. 

When I outgrew those things, she would share her stories while we walked the dogs. We always had dogs, growing up. Still do; always old rescues from the shelter Mom worked at. Dogs knocking on death’s doorstep. Most didn’t live more than a couple years, but every night, we would walk the ones that still could. And most nights, Mom would fill the silence between our footsteps with The Firelight Serpent, Backtongue Child, or The Mountain Woman.

I’m not sure where they came from. My mom is pretty much your standard blend of American white lady. Dad’s never really been in the picture. He had a quick fling with my mom in the spring of ‘97, and then spent her pregnancy and my whole life in and out of tent cities and needle parks. I don’t know my paternal grandparents, but Mom’s parents had a lightness to them that tells me they’d never heard the stories I was raised with. 

I should note here that they weren’t all scary, the stories. In fact, most weren’t. Different, maybe. Or dark. But not all scary. And there was something to them — some air of old tradition, of sanctity. A feeling that if you were told one, you ought to listen, you ought to be attentive, and you ought to let the story breathe. Hearing Mom’s stories was like listening to the gospel, except she never asked you to believe in them, and they never expected anything of you. But you sure as shit never disrespected them.

Now, I’m going to tell you about The Mountain Woman. The same way my mom told me. It gives me a lot of anxiety to put this on a page. It’s not scary, per se, but none of Mom’s stories feel like they should be anywhere but in the air hanging between teller and listener. You have to understand that under normal circumstances, I would never do this. All I ask is that you treat this story with respect. You treat The Mountain Woman with dignity. She is not a scary story to tell in the dark. She is not a ghost to summon in the bathroom mirror at a sleepover.

It goes like this.

*When the Woman died, she walked up the mountain. She did so smiling, though she had forgotten her shoes at the bottom with her bones, for the wild heather was blooming, and the mountain laurel, though flowerless, grew sweet along the weathered path she traveled. Where she stepped, the creatures of the ground writhed and rose to greet the gold of the dying sun, and the roots of the bushes she so admired shriveled in the darkness of the earth. For dead things should not walk the land. But walk, she did. On and on through early evening.*

Mom would pause here, always. She never forgot to let the story breathe. To let The Mountain Woman breathe. I don’t know why, but I know that it felt right.

*At dusk, mist crawled in with his cold hands and grasping fingers. The soft ground beneath her feet grew sharp with stone. Still, The Woman smiled. Still, The Woman walked.*

Sometimes, Mom would look up to the sky, here. Sometimes, she would stop walking, if only for a moment, her eyes closed. I would watch her. I would wait. Again — she had a way of speaking, when she told these stories. She commanded respect, patience. Or maybe the stories themselves did. So I would wait; at 6 years old or 16. And when she was ready, when the story was ready, she would continue.

*Dead things should not walk the land, but on The Woman walked— to the top of the mountain, trailing blood that wasn’t real blood from the soles of feet that weren’t real feet, shivering in skin that wasn’t real skin. And the trees bent from her, and the mist, he tried so hard with his pale, frigid fingers to hold her. Behind The Woman, her false blood stained the rocks red, stirred things best left undisturbed. Those things rose from the rocks; crude, ravenous imitations of shadows. As night fell deeper, they ate up the mist and all the wriggling creatures she drew from the earth farther down the mountain. Then, they moved upward into the air, and swallowed the last traces of day from the sky.*

Mom would stare straight ahead now, perfectly still. Maybe seeing something in her mind. Maybe really seeing something that I couldn’t. I’m less sure now. She would finish the story unmoving, as the dogs whined around our feet, and the halogen street lamps flickered on.

*The Woman reached the top of the mountain just as darkness fell in all its total hunger. There were no more laurels, no more heather, and no more stars in the vast, empty sky. Her shadows that were not shadows, born from her blood that was not blood, ate it all. Took it all. And in that starving darkness, The Woman stumbled, blind and reaching, smile eaten with all the light of the mountain, and she fell.*

At some point, as a teenager, I asked her what happened next — what became of The Mountain Woman. She cleared her throat and shrugged, started walking again. “I’m not sure. Maybe she got up and moved along. Maybe she fell into the night forever. Or maybe she woke up in the morning, at the bottom of the mountain, and walked back up again.”

My mom died last year. Early-onset dementia. It was a brutal disorder, and it took her from us long before it killed her. But I’m not here to get into seven years of ugliness and dread. I’m here to talk about what happened after. And some things from before.

I mentioned we had dogs. That’s important. They were important, in a way I didn’t understand before. After Mom got sick, I moved back home from college to help with everything, and I kept on the tradition. Kept taking in the dogs that were far too old for anyone else to want to adopt. Every couple years, I would cry, dig a new hole in the back yard, and go back to the shelter. 

I still have the same dog I had when she died. His name is Sparky. He’s a black and white shih tzu with a permanent ear infection, and bad joints. He’s half-blind, will walk up the steps, but never down, and I have to clean the gunk from his eyes every night with these special wipes. I love him. We never really had small dogs, but with Mom being sick and all, I figured it would be a little easier for me to manage. 

Besides — he doesn’t need to be big. He doesn’t have to fight. He just has to warn me.

The first time I ever heard Sparky growl was a week after Mom died. I was on leave from work, and while I should have spent that week planning a memorial, I spent it getting drunk all night, and sleeping all day. I wasn’t eating much, wasn’t brushing my teeth or showering. It was one of those drunken nights on the couch that the dog’s hackles rose, and he started growling. He looked ridiculous; tiny shih tzu staring at the door with his itty bitty teeth bared. I would have laughed, but I was struck with some cold, crawling fear, in that moment. A sudden paranoia crept and prickled along my skin like frost on glass. 

Maybe it was because I was home alone for the first time in years. Maybe it was because something was outside my door in the dark. 

I sat, frozen on the couch. I didn’t get up to look. I didn’t call Sparky over. I held my breath, and listened so hard I could feel my pulse in my ears. I heard nothing. Not even crickets. After maybe five minutes, the dog calmed down, padded back over and hopped up next to me. He lied down in my lap, but he kept his eyes on the door.

I stayed awake until the sun rose and I sobered up. I opened the curtains and looked outside. The neighbor across the street was sitting on her porch, smoking a cigarette in her pajamas. Nobody was at my door. Nothing seemed out of place. I let Sparky out to do his business, and I went to bed. 

The same thing happened the next night. And the next. And the next after that. I stopped drinking and fixed my sleep schedule. I still woke up to the dog growling, staring at the bedroom door or the window. 

You know how when you see someone so often, you don’t notice that they’re growing— that their hair’s been getting thinner, or their skin’s been wrinkling with age? It took me a week to realize my lawn was dying. Or, patches of it were. It wasn’t just that crappy yellow it turns in the dead heat of summer, either. It was totally and completely limp. I tugged at it in different spots, and each time it came right out of the ground, like there were no roots holding it in place anymore. Like they’d just let go.

I looked over to my neighbors’ yards. Perfectly healthy. Vibrant and green and lush under mild spring weather. That prickly feeling reared its head, again, and something drove me to walk backwards, toward the sidewalk. With the entirety of the front lawn in view, dread landed in my stomach heavy and cold and hot all at once, like a thousand twisting, hungry snakes. The dead patches weren’t random. They weren’t even patches, really. They were footsteps. Stumbling, winding footsteps that traveled in a tight circle around the house. Off-shoots of clearly well-worn paths led to each of the windows, diverging from the chaotic, dizzying orbit that must have been walked hundreds of times. In the garden beds underneath the windows, the climbing ivy had peeled off the walls and grayed. The daffodils and hyacinths reduced to shriveled, wrinkled stems. And worms, mole crickets, millipedes by the dozens writhed on the ground, as if drawn up from the soil by a magnet.

I didn’t pack a bag. I don’t even remember if I locked the door on the way out. I grabbed my dog, my phone, my wallet, and got the fuck out. I drove in no particular direction for an hour. I probably cried. Mom’s stories played on an unending, burning loop in my head.

Eventually, I stopped at an indoor/outdoor cafe. I sat at a table on the deck with Sparky. I ordered some sort of sandwich. Didn’t eat it. Couldn’t. Fed most of it to the dog. I wracked my brain for anyone we could stay with, and came up short. I’d lost almost all of my friends when I moved home to take care of Mom. Fell out of touch with the rest over the course of the years. Even if someone would help, I couldn’t risk bringing death to their doorstep. 

I settled on an Airbnb. It was this kitschy, sunflower-covered nightmare. The kitchen, living area, and bed were all crammed into one open space, but it was far enough away from home that it felt moderately safe, and that’s what mattered.

There was no question about it, in my mind. Mom didn’t make up The Mountain Woman. Maybe none of her stories were made up. And something dead had been walking around my house at night. 

Now, I’m not stupid. I know it was her. I know it was Mom. And if I were half a degree less sure about what would follow the poisoned earth and carpets of bugs, I might have done something dumb like try to see her. But she didn’t raise me to be dumb.

That night, when I was finally able to sleep, I dreamt of The Mountain Woman. Of ravenous shadows with sharp claws and wide mouths. I dreamt of falling forever in total darkness. Forever only lasted until two in the morning. 

I woke up to Sparky’s growling. This time, louder. He barked, hackles raised, and stared straight at the door. Someone, *something*, was trying to open it. The knob rattled for a moment, thankfully locked. Sparky’s attention moved to the side window, then. The one right next to the garish, sunflower-painted headboard. Through the sheer curtains, a moving shape. 

She never touched the window. Never knocked. Never spoke to me. She just stood there, like being close was enough. I wanted to scream. I wanted to punch something. I wanted to run away, or puke, or cry. I sat like a stone at the end of the bed, too scared to get up.

Hours passed. I stared at the window. My mother didn’t move. I only knew she was still there because the dog never calmed down, never looked away. The clock on the microwave across the room read seven in the morning, but it was dark as pitch outside. That darkness stretched its claws under the door, leaked slowly through the cracks around the windows like gas. It’s hard to explain what it looked like. Solid, but not — like something and a nothingness that replaced somethingness all at once. It was like it reduced three dimensions to two wherever it touched. And it had trapped us in the house.

I grabbed the dog and retreated to the center of the room, standing on the coffee table under a ceiling light. I was half-paralyzed by fear, praying that the late sun would just wake up and rise. Sparky shook and pissed all over everything. The darkness spread fast. When I blinked, it stole entire walls, and then the air in front of them- as if light died suddenly and completely at its border. I could swear it had teeth, millions of eating mouths that reached out from its edges. 

As those frenzied, gnashing mouths came for us, I did something I’m both ashamed and glad to admit. Staring into the flat, hungry blackness of the world, I screamed for my mom. I begged her to make it stop. I told her I loved her. And as the shadows ate their way up to my feet and down to my head and closed in all around us, I told part of her own story back to her. I screamed at her that dead things should not walk the land. 

Everything stilled for a moment. Grasping shadows froze in place. After a heartbeat, just as suddenly as it had come, the darkness fled from the room like hundreds of black hounds scrambling over each other to escape. The sun shone bright and orange through the windows. I shook so badly, I thought I would fall off the table, thought my legs might just give out, but I managed to step down, to set Sparky gently on the floor. He was untouched, perfectly fine. Trembling almost as badly as I was, but otherwise in one piece. I realized, looking down at my feet, where the shadows had crept the closest, that I wasn’t. The tips of each of my big toes were missing. Just *gone*, down to the base of my toenails. It didn’t hurt. The skin was completely smoothed off at the ends.

I sat on the couch for a long while, probably in shock. When I finally came back to myself, I put my shoes on, grabbed Sparky and my belongings, and walked out the door. When we’d arrived at the Airbnb, there was a maple tree in the front yard, healthy grass, and shrubs growing along the front of the house. When we left, there was nothing but cracked dirt, paving stones, and tunnels where roots once stretched. Not an inch of life left on the property. Not even the remains of it.

It’s been about a year since Mom died, and then died again. My toes haven’t grown back, but I'm back to work, and I've made some new friends. I’ve even been going on dates. The Airbnb owner took me to court over the disappearance of her lawn. I won. I don’t think any lawyer could hope to convince a jury that one woman uprooted and carried away every living thing on the property in one evening. I still feel bad over it, honestly. But I have bigger problems, now. 

I’m writing this because I woke up at the bottom of a lake this morning. 

Mom’s stories are coming back. I don’t know why, and I don’t know how. But I know what happens at the end of *Rika and the Riversong*, and it isn’t good. 

If you’ve somehow heard these stories, know that they’re real. Know that they’re still alive, and the things that live *in* them are still hungry. ",1,1750225461.0,u_Dirona-albolineata,0,1.0,False

I’m Luke. I’m 21 and officially living in Winter Park/Orlando for the Disney College Program, working and studying here until the end of the year. I’ve moved with hope in my chest—and yeah, a little fear too—but I’m still believing someone out there might want the same kind of love I do.

I’ve never really had the kind of relationship that lasts. It’s always almost. Always nearly real, then gone. Usually online. Usually right as it starts to feel like love. I fall hard. I give everything. And I get crushed. But I haven’t given up on the idea that there’s someone out there who feels like too much for most people—but maybe just right with me.

⸻

I’m:
	•	That golden retriever-type: affectionate, nerdy, occasionally clumsy with feelings, but honest to a fault
	•	Emotionally open, maybe too open at times—but I’d rather be real
	•	Hypersexual but deeply romantic—I crave intimacy, not just sex
	•	A writer, world-builder, and fantasy NSFW toy designer (yes, really)
	•	Creating a whole universe centered around love, healing, softness, and connection—because I need that in my life, too

⸻

Looking for:
	•	Anyone femme-presenting who’s in or near Winter Park/Orlando — including women, femboys, intersex folks, and others who feel aligned with femininity in some way
	•	Someone who’s tired of being “too much” and just wants to be loved exactly as they are
	•	Someone who wants slow, meaningful connection—not just quick flings
	•	Someone who can handle someone high-libido, emotional, nerdy, creative—and wants to build something real together
	•	Someone who still has hope even when it’s hard

⸻

If you’ve ever felt like the last one picked, like your needs were “too much,” or that you love in a way others don’t understand… I see you. I get it. And I’d love to talk.

No pressure. No expectations. Let’s start slow and see if something clicks.

Because maybe we don’t have to feel so alone forever.

1le97vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wolffparkinsonwhite/comments/1le97vu/ablation_on_june_30/,Ablation on June 30,"I made it to 51 years old before finally being diagnosed with WPW. I've had episodes of SVT since I was a kid, but never knew what it was. I've come close to passing out many times, but only passed out once that I can recall, when I was around 13 years old. My parents passed it off, understandably, as heat exhaustion.

In my 20s and 30s I could push through episodes of SVT (usually lasting about 10 minutes or so) without it effecting me too much. I didn't know what it was, just that I didn't feel right—weak and lightheaded. I saw a cardiologist in my late 30s who dismissed it. But after having more frequent and more severe episodes, I made an appointment with a new cardiologist who had me wear an event monitor for 2 weeks. It's easy enough for me to trigger episodes at will. Drink coffee and workout. That will do it pretty much every time. I purposefully triggered 4 episodes over the 2 weeks of wearing the monitor. My BPM during episodes of SVT reached 260. FYI, I also wear an Oura ring and that would just go blank during episodes of SVT. It couldn't track it.

So, I'm having an ablation on June 30. I generally avoid doctors and hospitals as much as I can... so yeah, I'm anxious about it. But I'm also excited at the prospect of possibly not having to worry about my heart freaking out at inconvenient times (like when hiking with friends, surfing, snowboarding, etc). 

Anyone in a similar situation? My cardiologist is sort of excited because he said it's rare someone my age hasn't already been treated. I guess I slipped through the cracks? I'll be sure to report back after.

1le95mx,https://www.reddit.com/r/mpcusers/comments/1le95mx/updated_for_ethersprite_and_regret_it/,Updated for Ether/Sprite and regret it,"I know everyone hates this current update for being slow so I delayed updating for a while. Then i saw the news about Sprite and Ether coming to standalone so I had to upgrade (didnt pop up for me on the last version of mpc 3 I was on). Love Sprite and Ether but this version of mpc os is almost unworkable. Thinking about rolling it back but I dont know if there are any other firmware that is compatible with Ether/Sprite. Maybe its just because of me running stem separation or my somewhat large template with intricate routing but it hangs up on almost every action. For background, my template uses 10-15% of cpu and 9% of memory on my live 2 on startup. Also been a while since I've done stem separation on the standalone (I use serato sample, spectralayers, or IZotope RX) and that was slow asl and kinda sucked. I love my mpc but things like that make it less of a standalone daw and more of an instrument. I still make full songs on there but commonly find myself going back in ableton to finish tracks and even just structure. Im in between if I revert to an older version or power through to use two plugin i spent a total of $50 on. They work great in ableton and I end up using it anyway most the time so Id be fine without it. But at the same time I do like to work on my mpc when I out of the house (pretty common) and could see both being awesome creative tools in the actual sound design phase rather than later in a mix/structure in ableton. Any thoughts? I know other people have complained about this update but feel free to vent here; will help influence my decision.

Side note: I produce mostly on a steam deck like handheld thats windows based and normally carry that with me too. So it is really east to just pop out the Micro Sd from one and pop it in the other or connect between the two. Also I thought this new update supported a mouse? I connected mine (via bluetooth) and nothing. And sprite/ether was def worth a cop this mid year sale.

Side side note: People are normally interested by my template so ill break it down and see if anyone inspires changes. I have a ghost output thats muted for groups to send to to prevent doubling with my retuns, submixes, and outputs. I will work backwards to explain routing.  Ghost output on 7/8, muted, and other mixes are just normal but every submix is summed on 1/2 so 3-6 are left alone unless its used in a live event. Returns are 1. Drums (distortion, soft clipper, maximizer all left off initially) 2. FX (Amp sim, Vocal doubler, resampler all off) 3.Main Chain (Mother ducker in ON, Mother ducker off) 4. Second Chain (mother Ducker off). The ducking can kinda get convoluted as you will see so ill leave their routing out. For the bus/submix we have 1. Kick (Mother ducker ON) 2. Snare (nothing) 3. Hat/perc (nothing) 4. Bass Soft clipper off, Mother ducker in ON, Mother ducker ON). 1-4 are sent to Drum return 1. Which brings us back to submix 5.Vocal (Flavor pro OFF) 6.Sample (Flavor pro OFF). Both 5-6 send to Second Chain (return 4). Submix 7 is Stack (Flavor Pro OFF) sending to Main Chain (Return 3). That is my synth stack ill get to in a second. And Submix 8 is left open for anything that may pop up so i dont have to change all my other routing. Now for the instruments and things. All instruments send to that muted ghost output like I said earlier to avoid doubling. Only the Returns send to output 1/2 where I have sound coming out in normal use case. Track 1+2 are Custom drum kits adapted from the default drum kit in mpc 3 so a kick, some hats, percs, couple samples, snare/rim, vocal chops, etc.. Each pad is routed to its respective submix and when I want another kit I just copy it over and change sounds. Makes it super easy to process sound that way and bypass the 4 fx limit. Also most stuff is already gain staged so it cuts down heavily on mixing time.  Track 3 is Bass (Sub Factory). All tracks have no proccessing initally so I can mess around with sound design and do the heavy lifting on the submixes/returns. Now Tracks 4 and 5 are where the stack comes into play. Track 4 is Chord send and track 5 is Keygroup receive. Jura is on Track 4 sending midi to Track 5. So ya its a lil confusing but it works great for me. I used to not mix much and just go right into ableton but this kinda streamlined my workflow. Kinda a fever dream type template lmao. But my friends that use it kinda swear by it now. And all the mixes/submixes/tracks/pads are color coded to help continuity. This section probably could have been its own post but its kinda a flex so I included it hahaha Would love to hear about anyone elses crazy templates or suggestions on mine. Im not a huge template guy in other daws but I do have a few (equally schizo) for different scenarios (Mixing at home, producing at home, Mixing at a coffee shop/bar, producing at same spots, and both styles for the studio I work out of).

This turned into a way longer post than I anticipated but if it helps a few people then it was worth it. Also while typing this I made a few minor changes like switching flavor to flavor pro as I had bought it after making the template. But it only uses 10% of memory and cpu so it doesnt really impact my performance at all since most things are off initially. IF enough people are interested i may upload it for people to try. Not sure about including the drum racks tho as some of the samples are from splice, friends of mine, or from packs so I cant really distribute those in good faith.

1le956u,https://www.reddit.com/r/entj/comments/1le956u/do_you_often_feel_like_a_robot_too/,Do you often feel like a robot too?,"19M. I have this thoughts sometimes when I'm alone, where I often come to the conclusion that in-detail, I work and live mechanically. If something that isn't in my plans occurs, I become awkward and don't handle it like I would naturally.

For instance, when I'm out with friends, when someone that I didn't know that would be invited and never met before, I can't be myself, like I've prepared my personality to be adjusted to my friends. Before anyone come from me saying that I might be mistyped INTJ, even though it's debatable, I'm really social and charismatic and I can get carried away in social gathering, with the outcome of me being a bit too loud (but idc so). 

Another example is when I'm listing to music I'm legit shutting off. When I'll be buying coffee, I'll be having my earbuds on transparency mode. When the barista comes to talk to me, I'll assume that he will be asking me for my order, thus, if he asks me 'Goodmorning boy, how you've been' I'm 100% answering 'An Freddo Espresso with no sugar' with no hesitation or second thought. When I'm on my way for a drink? If someone's sees me, waves at me and want to catch I wouldn't know a thing, cause I simply can't function like that. Even if I see them, I prefer to  act like I never noticed them. But even if it's too late to ignore, I wave back, and walk away. I can't have a small chat cause I can't comprehend it.

The thing is, that if I knew someone would happen to be out the same hour as me, wanted to small chat with me and let me know, I'd be excruciating social towards them. 

My poist is, that I must know everything that will occure during the day, even the small details, to treat and react not in an awkward way, almost like an AI answering to your request, which request must be specific and in-detail in order for it to get it right.

So, what do you think? Are any of you feel like that too or am I just spending too much time overthinking? ",2,1750224538.0,entj,0,1.0,False

so basically i had this routine before every exam (DO NOT FOLLOW Y10s!!!!!)

\- id have revision spill over to the night of the exam day (12am midnight +) and i would be high off adrenaline trying to finish before the exams

\- for every exam i did 5 years of past papers  (2020 - 2024) + CAQ + science with hazel or other video material

\- this obviously took a little while so i ended up sleeping at 4-6AM and waking up at 7:30 to 8:00 on my exam days (it was my fault cause i misclalculated how long it would take and would start proper revision at 5pm, i also had other chores, cooking, cleaning car, washing and whatnot)

\- i live 1-2 minutes away from my school so it was pretty easy to get there fast. I needed to be in the room by 8:30 so i left home by 8:15. 

\- at 8:30 sharp i would have a coffee shot, just 1 heaped tsp of instant coffee and some cold ass water 

\- pure energy.

\- after the exam i would rest but still be anxious for the next paper and it was even worse when an exam was on the following day

\- i couldnt sleep properly

\- when i had a good break i slept 12+ h in a day, from like 4am+ cause i couldnt fall asleep before then

\- so as a result after the very last exam i havent slept for 20h and am still wide awake

\- daily sleep of 2h or less daily was so stressful on my body

\- THE ACNE WHAT THE FUCK (+ weight gain im already a mindless eater lolz but im getting that back on track) and CHAPPED LIPS OMG CAUSE I KEPT PICKING IT CAUSE I WAS SO FREAKED OUT EVERYDAY and it would hurt so bad but i just kept tearin that ahh up

\- i remember thinking i missed and exam and literally couldnt breathe (it was 7am and i went to bed at 6am that day, my brother woke me up mistakenly)

so i dont know where to start and i have adhd so apologies if i just start rambling on here but like, in december i figured out i was trans after a massive dysphoric episode, everyday got worse and it hit me like a truck out of nowhere, this was about 2 months after i deconstructed religion and left conservative groups and severed a lot of ties, 

after awhile i was able to express myself more freely and this episode got so bad that i hated speaking, hearing my legal name was like an insult and even looking at my hands would cause me to cry, its like i became self aware all at once of my whole existance, sadly due to a bunch of life complications and stress eating over the years due to family abuse and my mom tormenting and manipulating me me pretty much constantly since i turned 10, its only gotten worse lately,

but during this episode I couldn't speak, i couldn't talk even because i couldn't muster up the courage too, I felt like my body wasn't mine entirely and looking in mirrors made me cry, I didn't know what to do and slowly it became apparent over the time that i was not cis, i was heavily looking over and analyzing things, but I came out to my friends too about it eventually and my best friend was supportive and same with my other friends, however later on he starts deadnaming me 24/7 and making transphobic jokes, and saying it was me being unreasonable with how I expected him to change every pronoun and name he calls me by in a matter of weeks, even though my other friends did so near immediately, eventually I came out to my mom, she also said she was supportive at first, and yet again did the same thing, trying to undermine and manipulate me in the name of ""safety"" saying being trans could end up with me getting killed

she would constantly do these games where in one scenario she stole a skittles chapstick from my aunt in front of her and then tried to make me use it, when i said no becuase my aunt didn't want me using it she just went ""yeah because you aren't fully interested in girl stuff anyway"" and continued on this path of constantly doing stupid shit and pressuring me into not be trans, getting increasingly aggressive over time, and eventually thinking I just heard about what being trans is from my friend on the buss and decided i was trans now, she then continued this manipulation campaign against me until eventually with my best friend and mom at me 24/7 i got to a point of being intensely suicidal and melancholic all the time for the next couple months i was just depressive and nihilistic and unable to be positive in anything, I also abandoned all hope of wanting to be a girl and just stopped thinking about gender all together, now wanting to just not think about it whatsoever to avoid the same problems

eventually i ended up with a manipulative partner with the mental state I was in and I ended up even worse afterwards, constantly drifting in between wanting to be trans and saying im ""just enby"" when eventually i moved in with my dad when he left to get away from my mom, where i tried to get on hrt secretly though medical ways here, however the canadian healthcare system is so slow that this is 3 months ago and i still haven't gotten a reply from anywhere about anything, my dad also hardly fed me when i was over at his house tbh, like it has traumatized me to the point of thinking about food disgusts me really, the smell of most foods makes me uncomfortable and i hate the feeling of being full as it just reminds me of my belly again, so mostly all i do now is eat less and less and substitute my eating mostly with coffee to knull the hunger,

but overall i moved back to my moms eventually due to there being food here and her promising to be better now, and she remained the exact same so I am just going to work full time this summer so i can save up money to move abroad (to germany).

  
Now, the situation i am in is i want to be trans but i am afraid people just wont love me i think? so i want to be a femboy cause i know that gets attention i think honestly from the bottom of my heart this is it

like i really dont know what to do anymore, I stopped having trust and hope in my friends long ago because they all ignore me or are extremely unhelpful and do nothing to help me but expect me to console them all the time or offer shitty advice, so I now just resort to honestly talking to chatgpt for **everything**, and by that I mean like advice on emotional scenarios, asking about advice on relationship stuff, questions on things and nearly everything to learn things and get help because I cannot trust anyone and everyone i do trust always ends up just fucking leaving or not wanting to put up with me, and I really dont know what to do anymore, my mental state is just horrible and I genuinely just have no motivation to do nearly anything but play games and wanting to work on a job to get enough money so i can leave the second i graduate, like i want to be a girl but I am just afraid that I will just end up the same looking fucking hideous and no one caring or liking me anymore due to just being trans, like after everything that has happened i just dont even feel human anymore, I get disgusted at food and hate eating, nothings apetizing and it pisses me off slightly to even hear my mom try to entice me into eating dinner and it makes me want to rip my ears off, I feel horrible anytime i can even feel my body becuase i am literally obese, that and I hardly feel like i can even muster up the courage to even shave anymore becuase I have no motivation to do so and I constantly have to keep up with it, its just too much with life and I genuinely dont know what to do, CAS constantly fails me and kidshelp phone is just a bunch of idiots who offer no help and empty words, I dont have anyone I am open to anymore and I have pretty much pulled away from every community i was ever apart of and I lock myself in my room all day in bed or playing games all the time to distract myself from the reality of my body and just be someone else.

sorry for just rambling but please can anyone just help, i just need some advice from anyone who isn't a fucking chatbot and just actually be able to recieve any form of help, ive started to just resort to hitting myself sometimes on my legs too often when i get in these moods or sometimes after my mom torments or manipulates me, i try to not let it get to me but often i end up laying in bed for hours watching videos or just paralyzed unable to even do anything, I just want to enjoy my life but everything just feels like its gotten ripped from me, and the one time i have a big moment and try to be open with everyone I just get people tormenting me for just wanting to be a girl and now i feel disconnected from that too in the only place i use to find safety and community in its just feels dead.",1,1750224372.0,MtF,0,0.67,False

But it just recently occured to me that the rule was probably there because Mormonism forbids drinking coffee and hot tea, so they made up that rule to prevent kids from drinking coffee while they were out (and it would look too obvious to explicitly say ""you cannot drink coffee because our religion forbids it"").

1le8xvb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1le8xvb,New to BMW world – coming from 12 years of JDM loyalty (please be gentle),"Hey everyone,
I’m new to the BMW world after spending the last 12 years only owning Japanese cars. Why? Simple reliability fears, horror stories and the general “if it ain’t broke, don’t Bavarian it” mindset.

But then a few days ago, I was minding my business on TikTok when a clean E46 popped up on my feed. That one video sent me spiraling into research mode kits, wheels, lips, and so on. Two or three late-night scroll sessions later I found myself on Facebook Marketplace… and yeah I bought an E46.

It’s a 320i M Sport auto. Runs like a dream so far. I wanted a 330 sedan but the prices were up there, and I couldn’t justify it. I skipped the coupe because I already own three Toyota Celicas (yes, all coupes) and if I brought home a fourth two-door I’d probably be living in one of them. I’m a family man now so gotta pick my battles.

I do know about the infamous coolant situation and I’ve already made it part of my morning routine to check it before heading out (coffee, keys, coolant—repeat).
But aside from that is there anything else I should keep an eye on?

As for mods nothing crazy for now but I’m eyeing a CSL trunk or spoiler, BBS RC ll, Fancywide diffuser and maybe BC coilovers. Still deciding on a front lip though. Anyone know if the 1-piece carbon fiber lip for the E46 M3 fits the M Sport front bumper? Or is that wishful thinking?

Also curious can M3 fenders fit on an M Sport front bumper setup, or do I need to go full M3 front end for that to work properly (like plug-and-play)?

I’m really new to the BMW scene, so take it easy on me.
And lastly… to all the BMW owners out there:
I apologize in advance I do use my indicators. A lot. Like lane changes, exits, overtakes—everything.
Don’t worry though I’m planning on taking some proper BMW driver training soon to fix that.

Appreciate any help or advice. Looking forward to learning more and becoming one of you guys (minus the turn signal neglect, maybe).

1le8t7u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1le8t7u,"Ex-coworker mentally ill, still stalking (3 years anniversary!)","This will be a long story, but I will try my BEST to shorten it. Or add a TLDR at the end. But the details make the story a lot better than the TLDR, in my personal opinion.
----------

We start off at 2022, when I worked a retail coffee job. Cue in my Korean coworker Joanna. I won't use her last name, but her first name is real. We were friendly but not close. She once got skid marks on her pants when we went out to eat... before her gynecologist appointment (Picture #3)

Now I already am put off by her for many reasons. Worse -- She constantly talks about wanting plastic surgery (""because my friend got full surgery and now she's super famous on Instagram!""). Or not taking her medication, but self-medicating with the devil's lettuce? Also always posting about an ex-friend she hates (whom we find out is a victim in a similar situation as me).

For some reason, her mental break was triggered by a Bumble hook-up with some dude in another state. She flipped out on everyone at work, we all reported her, Joanna was fired. Then going rabid on Instagram/Youtube/Tiktok, trying to doxx us. Except she doxxed the WRONG store, so she apologized online when the employees from another state complained. Then constantly threatening self-harm and claiming that she would ""embarass me and make me lose all my future jobs"".

Joanna has a Christian Korean background. So she went off the rails about seeing angel numbers everywhere. How she is Aphrodite/a siren that makes all men and women lust after her... saying she is so horny because she was a dog in her past life. 

Last I heard, her parents tried to lock her ass in Korea. But apparently Joanna got plastic surgery (literally no change) and bought $$$$ ""healing crystals"" from Korean shamans. The only really funny info, was Joanna admitting that a Korean psychologist diagnosed her with bipolar disorder/religious delusions. But she rejected the professional's diagnosis. Joanna thinks she has: autism, ADHD, depression, DID, and everything BUT BPD.
---------
Onto 2023/2024

We attend the same university, so I filed against her with the dean. Got a no-contact order against her. Of course, Joanna violates this anyways. She pulls a genius move! If she drops out of university, she can continue to stalk me 👍👍👍
--------

Flash forward to 2024/2025.

I heard from a coworker that Joanna admitted she ""felt sorry for the way she treated me"". She came back to the USA, admitted to a psych ward. Twice. Escaped the 2nd time, her family and friends had the police searching for her. Joanna was on Instagram taking selfies at the nearest homeless shelter lmao.

Her childhood friend (Picture #2) and a mutual uni friend (Picture #3) ; contacts me about her irregular behavior. And me finding out some lore from her childhood.

ANYWAYS --

Joanna starts to schizo-post on Instagram again. We're talking 30-40+ stories everyday. I guess I never blocked her because I wanted to collect evidence everytime she contacted me. She did, in fact, try to stalk me IRL again (Picture #1). I don't know why she's so obsessed with me. I just assume she's envious and jealous.

Joanna was supposed to stay with her uncle/cousins in another state. Realized she's crazy. Sent her ass back. Literally she started doxxing her mom's phone number and info + some random guy named Kenny. Where she posted screenshots of him begging for her to leave him alone (Picture #6). Joanna has harassed several guys like this before.

I tried to e-file a stalking protection order, but failed miserably. Because the court system sucks ass and they make everything as difficult as possible. Plus, I don't have her address, so I can't have the sheriff serve her a summons. So I gave up until...
----------

Present day, 2025

I get off work at 9 PM. Look at my phone and noticed a text from 6 PM (Picture #5).

Apparently Joanna has been using my phone number to sign up for shit. Which is really freaky. So I tell them upfront to PLEASE deny entry, if Joanna tries to claim the raffle prize. 

I have no clue why someone who's older than me + barely knew me for a few months... is so obsessed with me. I've blocked her in every way possible. 

AFAIK, she now has an OnlyFans and a Discord server where she begs dudes to pay her. Also I felt like she was intentionally skin-walking me. Joanna posted pictures of getting a haircut exactly the same as mine. Then posting that she intentionally found a black guy to date (my boyfriend is black...). And all sorts of shit that made me feel extremely uncomfortable. 

I'm going to visit the courthouse in-person tomorrow. I hope they can help me properly file a protection order. But I also heard that it might be useless. Honestly, I just want peace of mind and to be 50000 feet away from her. 

This is my horror story because I want it to be heard. I needed a place to listen and understand my stress. Thank you for reading this far! And obviously, if anyone has any advice. I would love to hear it 


TL;DR crazy ex-coworker girl from 3 years ago is mentally ill and harassing and stalking guys + specifically me.

Would love to be able to walk to coffee, breakfast, dinner, etc. I’ve only been once and stayed near the village which for sure fits the bill, but seeing a lot more rentals in our budget further out from there. Is moonridge, or any other area similarly walkable? ",1,1750223203.0,bigbear,0,1.0,False

\*\*“Skinwalker Hollow”

 

\*\*FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA\*\* 

\*\*Echo Ridge Trailhead — 14 Miles East of Town\*\* 

\*\*Altitude: 7,000 feet.\*\* 

Thick ponderosa pine forest. No cell service. Only whispers. 

 Five women have vanished here in six weeks. All were solo campers. There were no signs of struggle and no footprints leading away from the scene—only abandoned gear, soft impressions in the dirt, and fire pits still warm, as if the women had simply stood up mid-sentence and walked into the dark.

 What sets this case apart is that each woman left behind a voicemail message. 

 The messages were garbled and short, sent just seconds before they disappeared: 

“Someone’s out there.”  “It sounds like me… I don’t—” 

“It just said my name. My voice, but wrong.” 

 \*\*THE TEAM\*\* 

 

Lou Phillips and his squad—Medina, Martinez, Nolasco, Vega, and Gonzales—arrive under the guise of a hunting trip.. The media attributes the disappearances to bears.

 However, something feels off from the start. 

They move into the forest with silent precision, splitting into two-man teams near the last known GPS coordinates of the fifth camper, Kayla Morgan.

 \*\*Day One\*\*

 At dusk, Medina and Vega discover an undisturbed fire circle. Beneath some rocks, they find a buried journal that reads:

 “It knows what scares me. It wore my sister’s face last night. It smiled with teeth that weren’t hers. I can hear my voice crying for help. But I’m right here.”

 Martinez and Lou find boot prints—barefoot, human, but unusually long. The toes seem to drag, as if the person was resisting being walked.

 Then they hear it: soft and echoing between the trees.

 A woman’s voice whispers, “Help… I’m over here…”

 Lou raises a fist and everyone freezes.

 Medina states, “That’s Kayla.”

 Gonzales asks, “She’s alive?”

 Martinez firmly replies, “That’s not her, the cadence is off .”

 \*\*Nightfall\*\*

 They hear scratching on the tents. Each member of the squad is visited by something whispering in familiar voices: their mothers, sisters, wives, daughters. They cry, plead, and mocked.

 Nolasco pulls his weapon, but Lou grabs his hand. “That’s how it draws you out. Lets get them out in the open”

 \*\*Day Two\*\*

 They discover a structure built deep in the canyon—a ring of trees snapped inwards like a nest, with animal bones scattered around. In the center, they find a wooden door half-buried in the earth, its edges coated with handprints.

 They open it.

 Stale air and silence greet them as flashlights sweep across narrow tunnels. Then, they see movement.

 Eyes blink back from the dark.

 Kayla Morgan is there—barefoot, dehydrated, but alive. So are four other women, their eyes glazed as they whisper the Lord’s Prayer.

 They flinch from the light but do not run or scream.

 Medina reaches out gently. “It’s okay. You’re safe now.”

 Kayla’s voice cracks as she responds, “No. It’s still in me. Kill me kill me !!!

 

\*\*Extraction is Brutal\*\*

 The women scream when exposed to sunlight. Some try to claw their way back into the cave, while others sob, claiming that their bodies “don’t feel real anymore.”

 Back at the ranger station, no medical condition can explain their behavior. All the women are alive, with no physical trauma. However, something within them is broken.

 

\*\*Post-Mission Debrief, Flagstaff, Motel Room\*\*

 The squad sits in silence. No joking, no post-operation decompressing.

 Martinez lights a cigarette. “We didn’t get away. We survived.”

 

Lou stares out the window, looking toward the trees before responding. “Whatever that thing was… it didn’t kill them. It changed them, and I honestly don’t know what’s worse.”

 

Gonzales asks softly, “So what are we fighting?”

 

Lou replies, “This is still a Skinwalker, just more lore than we expected”

That night, as they prepare to return home, Lou quietly writes “” in his personal journal—a reminder.

 

This was just the beginning.

 

\*\*Psalm 13: Case File 001.2\*\* 

\*\*“Skinwalker Hollow” – Part II: The Key in the Pines\*\* 

 

\*\*Location:\*\* Private cabin outside Flagstaff. 

\*\*Time:\*\* 3:47 a.m. 

\*\*Weather:\*\* Clear. Moonless. Coyotes silent. 

 

The team is gathered around a worn kitchen table, each man awake despite the hour. No one has said much since they got the women out. 

 

They’re in the next room—alive, but not awake. Bodies limp. Mouths whispering fragments of thoughts that don’t sound like their own. 

 

Kayla Morgan stares at the ceiling, murmuring, 

“I’m still under the tree. Don’t leave my skin. It doesn’t fit right.” 

 

Medina rubs his temples. 

“This ain’t right, man. They’re here… but they’re not.” 

 

Vega interjects, 

“You saw them try to walk back into the woods. Like something was pulling them home.” 

 

Gonzales speaks quietly, 

“They’re possessed, bro.” 

 

Martinez is the last to speak, slow and firm. 

“No. They’re tethered.” 

 

He stands, moving to the wall where Lou had started drawing a rough map of the woods. He circles a canyon ridge, where they had found the women. 

 

Martinez continues, 

“This thing… the main one… it’s not just feeding. It’s nesting. Marking them—for prey it intends to come back for.” 

 

Lou steps forward, his voice low and controlled. 

“Then we cut the tether.”

 

\*\*Next Morning.\*\* 

 

The women are still whispering, but one of them—Maya Grant, the first woman who disappeared—begins to break the pattern. 

“You’ll find it beneath the thorns.” 

“Only fire breaks the mask.” 

“It still remembers the voice of the old blood.” 

 

The squad locks eyes. 

 

Medina mutters, 

“Is she talking riddles or is this—” 

 

Lou interrupts, 

“Clues.” 

 

They realize something chilling: the Skinwalker has a central form, unlike the shapeshifting fragments they encountered. It is a root. An alpha. 

 

And it still wears the form of someone it once was. 

 

Maya whispers one last thing before collapsing into silence: 

“He walks without skin, but wears your guilt.” 

 

\*\*Decision Made.\*\* 

 

 

This time, they won’t split up. They will go in as one. 

 

No flares. No tech chatter. Just steel, and fire. 

 

“We find the source,” Lou says, tightening his chest rig. 

“We kill it. And we set them free.” 

 

As they prepare their gear, Martinez passes a flask of whiskey. Nolasco sharpens an obsidian blade with Navajo origins. Gonzales mounts thermal scopes—eyes that see heat, not masks. 

 

Vega loads dragon’s breath shells. Just in case.   

 

\*\*Midnight Return.\*\* 

 

They reach the place the women were found. Lou spots something they missed before: 

 

A wide gash in the earth, where the trees grow in a perfect circle, bark blackened, and the air humming like a distant scream. 

 

Beneath the roots, they find bones—hundreds, some human, some animal—all arranged like a crude altar. 

 

And in the center— 

 

A figure. 

 

Tall. Skinless. Limbs too long. Face a perfect imitation of Lou’s brother, Jeff. 

 

But it isn’t Jeff. 

 

It smiles with rotting teeth and says, 

“Brother.” 

 

Lou doesn’t blink. His tunnel vision kicks in. His blood goes cold. His vision narrows. 

 

CRACK-CRACK-CRACK.

 

Lou fired three rounds center mass.

 

Too fast.

 

The Skinwalker twisted unnaturally and darted through the trees like liquid muscle. Bark exploded from the trunks it grazed. It vanished into the black.

 

Lou didn’t hesitate.

Dropped his rifle. Drew his sidearm. Moved fast.

 

Another blur—too late.

 

It crashed into Lou like a falling tree, claws slashing. Lou went down hard.

 

It pinned him, leaned close, and whispered in Jeff’s voice:

 

\> “You should have , little brother.”

 

 

The rage ignited.

 

Lou didn’t scream. He only hyperventilated

 

He headbutted the monster so hard it staggered back.

 

Rolled with the momentum—came up swinging.

 

A straight right to the jaw, a left hook that cracked bone. A body shot that echoed like wood splitting.

 

The Skinwalker reeled.

 

It had never—never—been hit like this.

 

Not by prey.

 

Lou closed in, stalking, brutal.

 

Olympic wrestling footwork. Elbows like hammers. Knees like steel.

 

Five strikes. Six. Seven.

Blood—not human—splashed against tree bark.

 

The Skinwalker shrieked in a voice that wasn’t Jeff’s anymore.

 

It scrambled back, claws raised. But Lou didn’t let up.

 

He grabbed its arm, snapped it at the joint, then drove his knee into its chest—right where its heart pulsed, hanging outside the ribs like a tumor.

 

Lou grabbed his combat knife.

The handle was wrapped in tape.

Fuck you was carved into the steel.

 

He plunged the blade deep in the skinwalkers throat

.

 

The Skinwalker screamed—not from its throat, but from everywhere.

 

The earth around them trembled. A wave of shrieks echoed through the forest. The tether was breaking.

 

And then…

 

Silence.

 

The Skinwalker collapsed. The illusion of Jeff’s face peeled away like wet paper. Just bone underneath.

 

It was dead.

 

Really dead.

 

 

\---

 

Back at the cabin.

 

The women—Kayla, Maya, the others—woke up.

 

No more whispers. No more sleepwalking.

 

Maya looked at Lou as tears spilled down her cheeks.

 

\> “You... you brought me back.”

 

 

 

Lou didn’t say anything.

 

He just stepped outside, breathing hard, fists still clenched.

 

Martinez followed, setting a hand on his shoulder.

 

“You good, brother?”

 

Lou’s eyes were fixed on the treeline.

 

“No,” he said.

 

 

Martinez nodded.

 

\*\*Psalm 13 – Campfire Debrief\*\* 

\*Location: Backwoods cabin outside Flagstaff\* 

\*Time: 3:11 a.m.\*

 

The fire crackled. No one had spoken in ten minutes.

 

Not because they had nothing to say.

 

But because they didn't know how to say it.

 

Lou was inside, washing off dark blood in silence. Outside, the rest of them sat in a rough circle, surrounded by empty beer cans and scarred faces—ghosts haunted by something worse than death:

 

A new reality.

 

Gonzales was the first to break the silence.

 

“Bro, did anyone else see that? Like—actually see it?”

 

Vega nodded slowly, his eyes wide.

 

“He beat it to death. With his hands. That thing was like a fucking demon, and Lou turned it into mulch.”

 

Medina gave a half-laugh, half-wince, still wrapping a cut on his forearm.

 

“Dude, I threw a flashbang at it and ran. Lou? Lou charged at it. Who the hell does that?”

 

Nolasco just stared into the fire.

 

“That wasn’t adrenaline. That was something else. It was… primal. Cold. I’ve seen UFC fighters break jaws, but he went for the heart, man.”

 

Silence hung in the air for a moment. Then Martinez leaned forward, his voice low.

 

“You boys remember Lous first day at the unit? Remember how he was back then?”

 

They all did.

 

Quiet. Watchful. First one up and the last one to eat. He took punches in training without flinching. He didn’t smile much, but when he did, you remembered it.

 

Martinez exhaled slowly, like smoke leaving his chest.

 

“I trained that kid. I saw what he had early on. But what he did back there? That wasn’t just skill. That was pain. Controlled. Directed. Weaponized.”

 

Medina shook his head in disbelief.

 

“If that thing had a soul, Lou beat it out of its body.”

 

Gonzales looked around, dead serious.

 

“So… does this make Lou the boogeyman now?”

 

Vega smirked.

“Nah. Calling Lou the boogeyman would be disrespectful.”

 

That finally broke the tension, and a ripple of chuckles passed through the group—a nervous relief.

 

But beneath it all lay respect, fear, and the beginning of something bigger.

 

Martinez stood up and looked toward the cabin.

 

“He’s not normal. He’s never been. But whatever’s coming next? We follow him.”

 

One by one, they all nodded.

 

Because Lou wasn’t just the muscle.

 

He was the compass now.

 

 

Psalm 13 – Chapter: Ghost Returns

Location: Northern Arizona – Desert Safehouse

Time: 10:04 a.m. – Two Weeks After the Flagstaff Incident

 

The safehouse hummed with quiet purpose.

 

Wires fed into the walls, solar panels buzzed softly on the roof, and Medina had finally patched the uplink to encrypted channels. The team was building the skeleton of something bigger—a mission, a watchtower, a sanctuary for the damned who still fought back.

 

But upstairs, in the quiet of an empty room with no personal effects, Lou Phillips stared at the mirror.

 

The face looking back wasn’t the boy his parents buried.

That boy had soft eyes. A crooked smile. Hope.

 

Now?

 

Now he looked like the thing Jeff left behind.

 

 

 

Outside the Safehouse

 

Martinez leaned against the front porch rail, arms crossed, watching as Lou stepped into the Arizona daylight. Lou wore a plain hoodie and jeans—no body armor, no rifle. Just his .45 and the photograph of his parents tucked in a breast pocket.

 

“You sure about this?” Martinez asked, voice low.

 

 

 

Lou nodded once.

 

“I was supposed to be in that coffin. They buried a casket full of ash and lies. I owe them more than that. Do you remember what you said  my subconscious, do you know what popped in my head first.

 

Martinez answered. “Jeff ? “

 

Lou replied.

 

“No my parents before they died, its been so long since I thought about them as they. All I’ve ever remembered was blood.” 

 

Martinez didn’t try to stop him.

 

He just handed him a folded cloth—a small, embroidered square. It was a stitched Psalm verse, frayed at the edges. Something from basic training. Something Martinez kept, for all these years.

 

“Give it to them. Tell ’em their boy became something.”

 

Lou tucked it into his jacket.

 

Two days Later – Brookpine Cemetery, New Jersey

Overcast. Cold. Quiet.

 

The cemetery gates creaked open on hinges that hadn’t been oiled in a decade. Lou moved through it like a shadow. Hoodie drawn up. Head low. Not a soul recognized him—not the groundskeeper, not the old woman laying roses by a soldier’s headstone.

 

He found the plot on instinct. It had haunted his dreams for years.

Two headstones side by side.

 

Margaret Woods

Beloved Wife. Mother. Never Forgotten.

 

Peter Woods

Marine. Protector. Devoted Father.

 

And next to them, a third:

 

Louis Woods

1999 – 2013

Gone too soon. But never alone.

 

Lou stood there for a long time. His throat tightened.

He knelt.

 

“I’m sorry,” he whispered.

 

The wind picked up. Leaves scattered like ashes. “He came for me. He took everything. But I’m still here. I shouldn’t be… but I am.”

 

He set the stitched cloth from Martinez between the stones, pressing it into the dirt.

 

“I’m not that scared kid anymore. I became someone. Someone who hunts monsters.”

 

His hand trembled. For a moment, just a moment—he felt like that boy again.

 

“I’ll make him pay. Not just for me. For you. For all of you

Brookpine Cemetery – Late Afternoon

 

The air had grown colder. Clouds pressed low against the earth like they were grieving too.

 

Lou stood still between the headstones, the stitched cloth now half-buried in soil. Wind stirred the trees. A crow called somewhere in the distance.

 

Then—footsteps.

 

Soft, deliberate.

 

Coming from behind him.

 

Lou didn’t move. He didn’t reach for the .45 at his back.

He just waited.

 

Whoever it was didn’t feel like a threat.

Not to him.

 

“You knew him?” a voice asked behind him. Female. Low. Hollow in that way only grief could make it.

 

 

 

He turned his head slightly.

 

The woman stood in dark clothes. A hood. Pale skin. Jet-black hair that curled slightly around her face. Her eyes were distant, sunken with memory. The tone of her voice suggested she'd been carrying pain for a long, long time.

 

“Knew who?” Lou asked.

 

She looked at the grave. At the name: Louis Woods.

 

“The boy. Lou. I… I used to know him. Long time ago.”

 

 

 

Lou turned now. Fully. Faced her.

 

And then he said it. “Yeah… I knew him.”

 

 

 

The woman’s brow furrowed. She tilted her head.

 

Then her eyes scanned his face.

 

And froze.

 

“…No.”

 

Lou said nothing.

 

She stepped forward slowly, almost afraid to get closer—like seeing him too clearly might shatter something inside her. Her hands trembled. Her lips parted. But no words came out.

 

“You’re dead,” she whispered. “I went to your funeral. I—Lou, I saw your face in my nightmares. Jeff…”

 

Lou nodded once. “I know.”

And just like that, she stopped breathing. Or maybe she remembered she hadn’t been breathing in years.

 

“Lou…” Her voice cracked.

 

He just looked at her—calm, steady.

 

Not afraid. Not confused. Not surprised.

 

“Jane.”

 

It hit her like a bullet to the chest.

 

Her knees almost buckled, but she caught herself. She hadn’t cried in years. Couldn’t. But something inside her shifted. For the first time since her death… she felt something. Something warm. Alive.

 

“You’re alive.”

 

 

 

Lou gave a faint smile—almost nothing. But it meant everything.

 

“You too,” he said.

 

 

 

Her expression darkened just slightly.

 

“Not really.”

 

 

 

He tilted his head slightly. Looking closer now.

 

Lou’s eyes were trained to spot threats. Trauma. Movement. Energy.

And now… he saw it.

 

Something behind her. Not human. A presence.

 

It coiled around her like a shadow with too much weight.

Not evil. But not merciful either.

 

It watched Lou with something close to… confusion.

 

It had carried Jane across the veil, kept her going—fueled her hate, her mission.

But Lou?

 

Lou didn’t register like other men.

 

He wasn’t cursed.

He wasn’t blessed.

He was… something else.

 

It whispered—but not in a language he knew. He ignored it.

 

His eyes never left Jane.

 

“Does it hurt?” Lou asked quietly.

 

 

 

She looked down.

 

“No. That’s the problem. Nothing does.”

 

 

 

He took a breath. Not pity. Not judgment.

 

“You still you?”

 

 

 

She nodded. Slowly.

 

“Most days. The rest… I fake.”

 

 

 

Lou nodded once, accepting it without hesitation.

 

“Good. Then we’re both ghosts.”

 

 

 

She looked up at him again. And for a flicker of a second—she smiled.

Brookpine Cemetery – Dusk

 

They stood in silence for a while.

The wind had softened. The world around them had gone still, like the dead themselves were listening.

 

Jane stared at the grave, lips parted, a faint tremble in her jaw. The woman known to the world as Jane the Killer—a name whispered like a curse—looked… small.

 

Not weak.

Just human again.

 

“Why are you here, Lou?”

 

 

 

Lou looked up at the sky.

 

“I owed them a goodbye.”

 

 

 

“You were gone a long time.”

 

 

 

“Had to be. The world thought I was dead.”

(He glanced sideways at her)

“You too.”

 

 

 

She nodded. Quiet. Her hair moved slightly with the breeze, but her feet stayed planted like she wasn’t sure she was allowed to leave.

 

“You killed a lot of people,” Lou said bluntly.

 

 

 

She winced.

 

But he didn’t flinch. Didn’t accuse. Didn’t raise his voice.

 

Just said it like a fact.

 

“They deserved it,” she replied, coldly. “Every one of them. Rapists. Predators. Monsters in suits. I made sure.”

 

 

 

“Still killed ‘em,” Lou said, eyes narrowing.

“And it cost you.”

 

 

 

That silence again. Heavy.

 

“Do you still feel anything?” he asked.

 

 

 

“Only when I saw you.”

 

Lou replied

“ Sounds like hope.”

 

He nodded, as if that made sense.

 

“Then come with me.”

 

 

 

She blinked.

 

“What?”

 

 

 

“Come with me. Back to Arizona. I got a place. People who trust me. We’re building something. You don’t have to kill anymore. Just be there.”

 

 

 

She looked at him like he was speaking a foreign language.

 

“You… trust me?”

 

 

 

“I know what Jeff did to you,” he said simply. “I know what it made you into. But I don’t see a killer. I see somebody trying to crawl back toward the light. Even if your hands are covered in blood.”

 

 

 

Jane looked away. The entity around her seemed to twist, reacting. But Lou never looked at it.

 

Only her.

 

“No one’s looked at me like that since before it all went to hell.”

 

“Then maybe it’s time someone did.”

 

 

 

 

 

The Drive – Arizona Bound

Three hours later.

 

The desert stretched out on either side.

 

Lou’s truck rolled through the dark,

Jane sat in the passenger seat. Hair tied back now. Hood off. She kept stealing glances at him.

 

“You drive like a cop,” she muttered.

 

 

 

Lou smirked faintly.

 

“Seriously?”

 

 

She nodded slowly, watching him.

 

“So what have you been doing? These past years?”

 

 

 

Lou exhaled.

 

“Army. Green Beret. Got out. But I couldn’t stay still. Found others like me. Started hunting the real threats. Not people. Things.”

 

 

 

Her brows knit together.

 

“Like what?”

 

“Cryptids. Cursed entities. Things that don’t belong in this world. Stuff we thought were stories.”

 

“And you just… decided to fight them?”

 

“Someone had to.”

 

 

 

She looked out the window for a moment. Then back at him.

 

“Far cry from the quiet boy that followed his older brother around.”

 

Lou replied

 I’m trying. Same as you.”

 

 

 

Another beat of silence.

 

“Why are you helping me, Lou?”

 

“Because I remember who you were before Jeff took everything from you . And I think that girl’s still in there.”

 

Jane looked down at her hands. For once, they didn’t look like weapons.

 

“I don’t want to hurt anyone anymore.”

 

“Then don’t.”

 

Lou pulled off the highway. The outline of the safehouse glowed faintly in the distance—warm, waiting.

 

“Home?” she asked.

 

 

 

“Yeah. For now. I have a Cabin close by”

 

She leaned her head against the window.

 

“Sounds nice.”

 

 

Psalm 13 Safehouse – Arizona

 

The air smelled like sweat, cedar, and gun oil. A punching bag swung lazily from a new support beam as Vega and Gonzales tried to hook up a flat screen. Martinez was barking orders, shirt off, sawdust clinging to his chest hair like war paint.

 

“Medina! That door frame is crooked again, I swear I’ll duct tape your skull to the goddamn level!”

 

The sound of tires crunching gravel cut through the heat.

 

The truck stopped. Doors opened. First came Lou—stone-faced

 

Then came her.

 

Jane stepped out, eyes shielded by her hood. Black hoodie. Pale hands.

 

The squad went quiet like wolves sniffing something unnatural.

 

“Uh…” Gonzales squinted. “Lou? You bring a fan?”

 

Jane didn’t blink.

 

“Only if she’s here to kill us,” Vega muttered, half-joking, half-not.

 

“Dibs on haunting the TV,” Medina added.

 

Martinez turned slowly from the wall he was hammering.

“Who is she?”

Lou didn’t break stride.

 

“This is Jane Arkensaw.”

 

“The Jane?” Gonzales asked. “Jane the Killer?”

 

Jane cocked her head slightly. “That’s what they call me.”

 

Gonzales looked her up and down, paused, then said:

 

“Huh. Thought you’d be taller.”

 

The squad laughed.

 

Jane blinked again. Confused.

 

“That’s an odd reaction?”

 

Martinez finally stepped forward. Not smiling. Not hostile.

 

“Look,” he said. “We’ve seen demons. The real kind. Heard things cry in languages older than sin. If Lou brought you here, that’s all we need to know.”

 

He pointed at her chest—not to intimidate, but to ground her.

 

“You don’t answer to the world anymore. Not here.”

 

 

She stared at him. At the weight of his words. For the first time in years, she felt something unfamiliar: safe.

 

“Also,” Martinez added, “if you’re gonna live here, we’re doing movie night every Friday. First pick’s yours unless you choose Twilight—in which case, back to the woods you go.”

 

Gonzales cackled. “Let her stay, bro. She looks like she could beat Vega’s ass.”

 

“She probably could,” Vega admitted.

 

The team eased around her like she’d always been there.

 

And just like that, Jane wasn’t a monster.

 

She was one of the boys.

 

 

 

Later That Night – Rooftop

 

Jane sat on the roof alone, legs pulled in close. The desert stretched out like a burned canvas, the moon pale and bruised.

 

Inside her, the entity stirred.

 

Its voice came like the echo of a memory behind glass.

 

(He is not what he seems.)

 

“Lou?”

 

 

 

(There is… familiarity. I felt it when you stood beside him. Like something I once knew. Long ago.)

 

“You don’t remember anything from before me.”

 

 

 

(I didn’t. But now—there’s a… warmth. Like the edge of a fire I’ve forgotten how to build.)

 

“What does that mean?”

 

 

 

(It means I am older than you know. And he is not just man.)

 

Jane looked toward the backyard, where Lou was sitting alone with a whiskey bottle and an old Bible on the table.

 

The squad had let her be. No lectures. No fear. Just dumb jokes and muscle and trust.

 

“He called me human.”

 

 

 

(That’s why it hurts.)

 

“What?”

 

 

 

(Because for the first time in years… you almost believe him.)

 

Jane exhaled slowly, resting her forehead against her knees.

 

“I don’t know what he is,” she whispered.

 

 

 

(Neither do I.)

 

 

Morning – Psalm 13 Safehouse Yard

 

The sun was barely up, turning the sky a soft burnt orange. The Arizona desert buzzed low with life. Wind swept through mesquite trees and the scent of coffee and gun oil drifted in the air.

 

Jane stood on the back porch of the safehouse, hood still up, watching.

 

She didn’t speak. Didn’t move.

 

She just watched.

 

Out in the yard, chaos lived in harmony.

 

Vega and Gonzales were dragging sandbags into a combat pit they’d been building out of tires and plywood. Martinez stood nearby, barking half-serious criticisms while casually fixing a jammed M4. Nolasco hit the heavy bag with clean, practiced elbows. But the real star…

 

Was Medina.

 

Shirtless. Again.

 

He was trying to vault over a stack of ammo crates and do some sort of reverse roll he saw in a movie.

 

“Medina,” Martinez snapped, not even looking up, “if you pull your back doing Power Ranger shit again, I swear to God I’m gonna leak your Icloud photos

 

 

 

“Let him work, bro!” Gonzales laughed. “His shirt’s already off, he’s in character.”

 

 

 

“Man hasn’t worn a shirt since we raided that haunted Waffle House,” Vega added. “It’s part of his religion now.”

 

 

 

Jane blinked, arms folded, half-expecting this to descend into violence. But it didn’t. It was loud. Dumb. And strangely warm.

 

Lou stepped out beside her, sipping coffee from a chipped wooden mug.

 

“Every mission,” he said without looking at her, “his shirt ends up off.”

 

 

 

Jane glanced sideways at him.

 

“Every mission?”

 

 

 

“Even coffee runs.”

 

 

 

“Why?”

 

 

 

“No one knows. We stopped asking. We just… accept it.”

 

“Is he…?”

 

“I don’t think so, He had a girlfriend.”

 

Jane huffed. Almost a laugh.

 

“You’re serious.”

 

“Dead.”

 

 

 

They stood there in silence, watching Medina trip on a rake and pretend he didn’t.

 

Then Lou turned slightly, nodding toward the yard.

 

“This is the training ground. We run drills here. Test gear. Beat the hell out of each other when words don’t work.”

 

 

 

Jane’s expression hardened.

 

“You let them beat each other up?”

 

 

 

“Better us than what’s out there.”

 

 

 

She watched a moment longer. Nolasco offered Vega a glove tap. Vega nodded, dropped into a boxing stance. The hits were hard but controlled. Clean. Respectful.

 

“They listen to you,” Jane said.

 

 

 

“Sometimes.”

 

 

 

“And this place—”

 

 

 

“It’s the only thing keeping us sane.”

 

 

 

Jane slowly descended the porch steps. The dirt crunched under her boots.

 

“They don’t treat me like I’m broken,” she murmured.

 

 

 

Lou looked her dead in the eyes.

 

“Because you’re not, Jeff’s broken.”

 

 

 

She flinched—not from pain, but something worse. Hope.

 

She turned away quickly, arms crossed again.

 

“I don’t know what I am anymore.”

 

 

 

Lou shrugged.

 

“Start with what you want to be.”

 

 

 

She looked back to the yard, where Medina now attempted a flying knee at a punching bag that was not ready for it.

 

The others cheered.

 

Jane let out a small breath.

 

Something in her chest stirred. The weight didn’t vanish, but it shifted.

 

For the first time in years…

 

She wanted to protect something.

 

Safehouse Yard – Midmorning

 

The sun was climbing higher now, casting sharp shadows across the sand. Medina had finally put a shirt back on—though it looked temporary—and the rest of the squad had dispersed for various tasks. The yard buzzed with easy rhythm. Jane sat on an old crate near the perimeter wall, sharpening a blade more out of habit than need.

 

Martinez walked up slow, boots crunching gravel.

 

“That’s a custom blade?” he asked, squinting as he lit a cigarette.

 

 

 

Jane didn’t look up.

 

“Made it myself.”

 

 

 

“Looks like it could shave bark off a redwood.”

 

 

 

She smirked. A little.

 

“Only if I like the tree.”

 

 

 

Martinez exhaled smoke through his nose, crouching nearby, elbows resting on his knees. Silence hung comfortably before he finally broke it.

 

“You knew him before all this.”

 

 

 

Jane’s hands paused on the blade.

 

“Yeah.”

 

 

 

Martinez looked out over the yard—toward the makeshift weight bench Lou had built from a steel axle and two truck tires.

 

“Never said much about the past. But I know pain when I see it.”

 

 

 

Jane set the blade down, her voice quieter now.

 

“Lou wasn’t just some good kid. He was… decent in a way most people grow out of. He looked people in the eye. He believed in things.”

 

 

 

“Still does,” Martinez muttered. “Even if it burns him.”

 

 

 

She nodded.

 

“After what Jeff did… he should’ve died. You know that, right? He was declared dead. Official. Body bag and everything.”

 

 

 

Martinez turned to look at her now.

 

“You were there?”

 

“I was there before. At the house. Before Jeff went full monster.

 

 

 

He thought Jeff was just angry. Lashing out. But Jeff…”

 

 

 

Her voice faltered. Her eyes dropped to the ground.

 

“Jeff wasn’t human anymore.”

 

 

 

She swallowed hard.

 

Later, I found out—Lou crawled. Five miles. Throat cut. Face slashed. Barely breathing. Just dragging himself through the dirt.” Then he came for me and my family.

Jane stopped there

 

 

 

 

Martinez stiffened. He hadn’t known that part.

 

“Jesus…”

 

 

 

“No one should’ve survived that. But he did. They found him just before dawn. Hands were ground raw. Body shredded. They said it looked like he'd been hunted by a pack of animals. But he kept going.”

 

 

 

Martinez took a long drag from his cigarette.

 

“That’s why he’s the way he is.”

 

 

 

“He doesn’t hate Jeff,” Jane said, looking at Martinez for the first time. “Not the way I do. Lou… hates what Jeff took from him. What he almost turned into.”

 

 

 

Martinez looked down at his boots.

 

“We saw pieces of it. The tunnel vision. That look he gets in combat. Like he’s not seeing them. He’s seeing Jeff.”

 

 

 

Jane nodded slowly.

 

“Yeah. But even then, he still pulls back. Still refuses to become the thing that hurt him.”

 

 

 

“He ever talk to you about God?”

 

 

 

Jane nodded again.

 

“A few times. He said if he ever let go of that thread, he’d never come back.”

 

 

 

Martinez dropped the cigarette and crushed it beneath his heel.

 

“That thread’s the only reason we follow him. Because he never cut it—even when it would’ve been easier.”

 

 

 

A silence stretched between them again, deeper this time.

 

Finally, Martinez stood up, brushing dust from his knees.

 

“I’m glad you’re here. Just so you know.”

 

Jane Replied

 

“I wasn’t sure I would be welcome.”

 

 

 

“You’re family now. Nobody here’s perfect. We all got blood on our hands. Some of us got more than others… but we’re still standing.”

 

 

 

“Thanks, Martinez.”

 

 

 

“Don’t thank me. Just make sure Medina doesn’t set the damn range on fire again. We’ve only got one.”

 

 

Jane hands Martinez the knife .

 

Martinez asks . Are you sure ?

 

Jane says. If he says I don’t need to fight, I wont

 

Martinez smirks. Just so you know Im giving when he graduates from the rape whistle.

 

Jane replied. So its gonna be a while

 

He turned to walk away, then paused.

 

“You’re the only one he really talks to, you know.”

 

“Lou?”

 

“Yeah. You bring him back. Little by little.”

 

Jane watched him go.

 

Then looked back at the training yard—at the life these men had built in the ashes of monsters.

 

The sun was dipping below the desert ridgeline, casting the landscape in bruised shades of purple and orange. The heat had finally let up. Wind stirred the dust low along the ground. Lou stood near the back of the safehouse, tightening a bolt on a rain barrel setup when he heard soft footsteps approaching.

 

Jane.

 

No words yet. Just the sound of her shoes crunching against gravel. She came to stand beside him, arms crossed but relaxed. She looked out across the property—training yard to the left, the mess area with its crooked picnic table to the right, and beyond that, open sand and cactus stretching into nothingness.

 

“I’ve never been to Arizona,” she said finally.

 

Lou gave a faint nod, still looking straight ahead. “It’s peaceful, if you don’t mind the heat. Rattlesnakes don’t give you much trouble if you show ‘em respect.”

 

“That a metaphor?” she asked, smirking slightly.

 

Lou cracked a smile. Just barely.

 

“No. Just snakes.”

 

They started walking. Slow. No rush. Just silence and boots on the earth.

 

Jane looked around as they moved past the perimeter wire.

 

“Did you build this fence?”

 

“Mostly Martinez. But I tightened the lines.”

 

“It’s neat. Like a fortress.”

 

“We like to sleep knowing there’s at least some warning before something claws through.”

 

They passed the pull-up rig, where Medina had been showing off earlier. The bar was still swaying slightly from his last set.

 

“Your team’s something else,” Jane said.

 

Lou looked toward the horizon, then back at her. “They’re brothers. All earned.”

 

“They don’t look at me like I’m broken.”

 

“You’re not.”

 

Jane turned to face him. Her voice lowered. “You don’t flinch. Not at my scars. Not at my story.”

 

Lou met her gaze. Steady.

 

“I’ve had to carry my own.”

 

She swallowed, eyes briefly shimmering with something distant. “You were a kid. When Jeff did what he did. You shouldn’t have survived.”

 

Lou’s jaw flexed.

 

“I didn’t. Not the version they buried.” He paused. “The one who came back… he had to make peace with the ghosts. Or at least learn to walk beside ‘em.”

 

They stopped at a shed with a rusted door. Lou pulled it open. Inside sat a half-covered old black ’70 Chevelle SS, frame stripped, hood popped, tools laid out in a methodical circle.

 

Jane’s eyes widened slightly. “This yours?”

 

“Used to belong to my dad,” Lou said quietly. I never knew it existed until it was gifted to me by a family friend.

 

She stepped closer, brushing dust off the hood with her fingers.

 

“You ever gonna finish it?”

 

Lou looked at the car like it was a memory that could still breathe.

 

“Yeah. Just been waiting for the right time.”

 

“And now?”

 

Lou didn’t answer right away. Instead, he crouched beside the car, brushing his fingers over the exposed engine block.

 

“I think I’m ready to stop surviving and start… building.”

 

Jane leaned on the frame, watching him work.

 

“You think someone like me can do that?” she asked, voice almost a whisper.

 

Lou stood. Faced her. Voice calm, certain.

 

“I don’t think you’re someone like anything. You’re you. You made it back. That’s enough to start.”

 

She blinked hard and looked down at the Chevelle.

 

“It’s not perfect,” she said, nodding at the car.

 

“Neither am I.”

 

The wind picked up, carrying the scent of mesquite and engine grease. For a moment, neither of them spoke.

 

Then Lou turned to her again.

 

“You ever want to learn how to fix an engine?”

 

Jane raised an eyebrow. “You offering to teach me?”

 

“Only if you don’t mind swearing a lot when things don’t go right.”

 

She chuckled.

 

“Sounds like therapy.”

 

Lou nodded once.

 

“Sometimes it is.”

 

And there, in the shed surrounded by dust and the quiet hum of possibility, something real and slow began to take root—no longer haunted, but healing.",1,1750223108.0,13Psalm,0,1.0,False

I'm having an issue using the UniPC sampler on Forge. I like the results on SDNext but for some reason I'm not getting the same output on Forge. It seems splotchy and very rough or something. I'm pretty sure something isn't right. 

I was hoping someone could confirm for me that they are getting the same thing. I realize it could be something on the backend that Forge doesn't have or something.

I like Forge for turning out many images to pick through. I can't do that as easily with SDNext. Seems I have to press three different buttons for generate, hires, and then detailer. Not a huge fan of that.

These are my settings if anyone would like to help.

If anyone could explain that it just won't be possible, that'd be alright too. Or if I'm doing something wrong. Thanks!

I made this lyrics in a night and a half, then got bored and made it into an AI song that I posted here yesterday that people did not like very much (AI sucks, they get the sound all wrong) anyways here's the lyrics. 
Song name: Bottom of a Coffee Mug
(Intro)
You're feeling dragged down,
More weight than you need.
Maybe you're just tired,
So you make some coffee.

You make a cup and drink it down,
Some time later, there's a little bit left.
You drink some more and ya see your eye,
The reminder that you're here... your heart lept.

(Music)

(Chorus)
It's the bottom of the mug where you see yourself,
Where you imagine being there in the deepest depths.
It's a little unexpected but it's all the same,
Cause the thoughts in your reflection are a welcome kinda pain.

And then you think of how your coffee's already gone,
You'll need another cup so you can keep drinking on.
While you're walking to the pot you get a sorta deep thought,
Maybe coffee when it's hot is all you've really got.

(Music)

(Verse)
You wanna go out and use your life,
But you sit there drinking coffee alone.
You see your eye in the bottom of the mug,
It's almost foreign like it's not your own.

I know the longing, the need for drama,
But you don't know how to go about living new.
Maybe it's the coffee getting to your head,
Or maybe the thoughts are just too real for you.

(Music)

(Chorus)
It's the bottom of the mug where you see yourself,
Where you imagine being there in the deepest depths.
It's a little unexpected but it's all the same,
Cause the thoughts in your reflection are a welcome kinda pain.

And then you think of how your coffee's already gone, 
You'll need another cup so you can keep drinking on.
While you're walking to the pot you get a sorta deep thought,
Maybe coffee when it's hot is all you've really got.

(Music)

(Verse)
You've been drinking coffee for so many years,
What's it doing to your breaking mind?
You look it up so you know what's going on,
It causes anxiety, that's what you find.

So maybe you'll stop and maybe you won't,
Coffee's too good to stop right now.
You wanna stop, go live your best years but your mind is going crazy and you don't know how.

(Music)

(Bridge)
Look at them all having fun,
I want to join in on their teenage runs,
I'm not far different with an aching soul,
What's it like as a rebel MAN I REALLY WANNA KNOW!

(Chorus)
It's at the bottom of the mug where you see yourself,
Where you imagine being there in the deepest depths.
It's a little unexpected but it's all the same,
Cause the thoughts in your reflection are a welcome kinda pain.

And then you think of how your coffee's already gone,
You'll need another cup so you can keep drinking on.

For about a year in my mid-20s, when I was broke, unemployed, and borderline depressed, I’d dress semi-formal and sneak into those hotels during the day.

I’d sit in the lobbies with a laptop I couldn’t afford anymore, drink the free coffee, and pretend I was just on break from some important pitch or sales meeting. Sometimes I’d even walk into a random conference and act like I belonged, nod along, take a pen, clap at the end.

No one ever questioned me. I wasn’t stealing, I wasn’t disrupting anything. I just wanted to feel like someone who mattered. Like I had somewhere to be.

It sounds pathetic, I know. But those random hotel visits gave me a weird sense of motivation. Like I was rehearsing for a life I hadn’t earned yet.

Now I actually do have a stable job and I’ve been invited to speak at a real conference next year. I haven’t decided if I’m going. I’m scared I’ll feel like I’m still faking it.",20,1750222591.0,confessions,1,0.95,False

I've been lurking here recently and I'm looking for some buying advice.

|Criterion|Reason|
|:-|:-|
|Location|United States|
|Preferred drink types|Mostly milk based drinks (Lattes, Cappucinos)|
|Drink frequency|2-3 drinks a day|
|Space|Not a major concern|
|Experience level|I've had a home espresso setup for some time but I don't experiment much.|
|Manual or electric|I'd prefer electric Grinder and Espresso Machine|

I've looked at countless videos, and a lot of them seem to be getting deep into the technical side of things and I was getting overwhelmed with the amount of variables to consider. I want to have a somewhat simple setup as my wife will also be using it, and she prefers to have her morning cup of coffee to be made as easily as possible.

For the beans, I generally get medium and darker roasts, but I've also never tried lighter roasts and I'm curious to try them out so I'm also looking for a setup which can support that.

I'm considering the following machines

Grinders : 

* Eureka Mignon Specialita
* DF64 Gen 2
* Niche zero

Espresso Machines:

* Profitec GO
* Lelit Victoria
* Fellow Espresso One (Pre-order)

First was Yugo's all-too-sudden ""graduation"", which we know from U-san is anything but amicable. Whatever he did, it was enough for them to just cut him off in complete silence.

Then there was the infamous Zaion termination. It was kinda genius actually: ""Hey, Zaion has barely made a name for herself and has already gone against Corpo Rules™, let's slander her and see what happens..."" and IT WORKED. Zaion was painted as a villain and was harassed until she nearly attempted.

By this time, one thing was clear: If you mess with the NijiEN ""Family"", you will leave in silence or shame.

But what about Mysta and Nina? They managed to graduate on good terms, right? For a while, yes, they were still in Niji's good graces. But then they did the unspeakable sin of joining another rival agency, and then the gloves were off.

Which leads us back to Selen's ""Last Cup of Coffee"" MV. We knew that it wasn't being held up due to ""permissions"" from the original artist. Selen has had perms for it YEARS ago. No, it was being held up because it featured two ex-livers that were active in Vshojo, and NijiEN somehow can't stand the idea of that.

There is (or was) somebody in NijiEN, whether it was staff, management, or even one of the talents themselves, who is incredibly petty and vindictive to any perceived slight to their ""family"" brand, that they were willing to throw talent projects in the shitter for it.

But Selen had had enough of her projects being denied. She released the song, and the rest is history. What's funnier is that NijiEN, in their infinite wisdom, tried to pull a Zaion-tier slander on her, completely forgetting the fact that Selen is incredibly beloved in the vtubing sphere. It backfired on them so hard that we're still feeling the fallout to this day.

What can we learn from this? Just don't be petty asshole. Whoever pulled the trigger on NijiEN's downfall needs to be fired by now. I mean, hopefully they were, but seeing the drama that is currently unfolding right now? Yeesh...",117,1750222256.0,kurosanji,14,0.98,False

And food reviews aren't always the most accurate because taste is very subjective; some people hate the taste or stevia-based syrups, while others love it, etc...

Urban living calls for style that’s sleek, smart, and effortlessly cool. That’s where **Urban Modern design** comes in — a trend that blends industrial elements with clean lines, neutral palettes, and a strong focus on functionality. At the heart of this aesthetic is one of the most versatile flooring choices today: [grey laminate flooring](https://onestopflooring.co.uk/collections/grey-laminate-flooring).

Whether you’re revamping a city apartment or designing a loft-style home, grey laminate brings a contemporary base that’s both chic and practical. In this guide, we’ll show you how to style grey laminate flooring within an Urban Modern scheme — from colour combinations and furniture picks to lighting and layout.





# 🏙️ What Is Urban Modern Design?

Urban Modern is the design child of industrial grit and minimalist elegance. Think: raw textures paired with refined finishes. It’s often seen in open-plan spaces with **exposed brick walls**, **metal accents**, **large windows**, and **monochrome or neutral palettes**.

At the core of this style is a sense of laid-back sophistication — where every piece is intentional, yet nothing feels overdone.





# 🌫️ Why Grey Laminate Flooring Works So Well

Grey laminate flooring has become a go-to choice for urban interiors — and for good reason:

* **Versatility**: Grey sits beautifully between warm and cool tones, making it easy to pair with other colours and materials.  
* **Texture variety**: Modern laminates mimic wood grains, concrete, or stone finishes — adding depth without overwhelming the space.  
* **Practicality**: Laminate is durable, scratch-resistant, and easy to clean — ideal for high-traffic city living.  

From **soft ash tones** to **moody slate hues**, grey laminate provides a clean, understated canvas for modern design statements.





# 🎨 Styling with Grey: Colour Palettes That Pop

One of grey’s biggest strengths is its neutrality — it plays well with almost any palette. Here are a few Urban Modern combinations that really shine:

* **Grey + Black + White**: Keep it crisp and classic with monochrome accents — ideal for an edgy loft vibe.  
* **Grey + Brass or Gold Accents**: Introduce warmth through metallic fixtures and decor.  
* **Grey + Navy or Charcoal**: Add depth and sophistication without overwhelming the room.  
* **Grey + Blush or Terracotta**: Softens the look and adds a hint of urban charm.  
* **Grey + Greenery**: Bring the outdoors in with plants and foliage for a calming contrast.  





# 🛋️ Furniture & Decor Tips for an Urban Modern Look

When decorating an Urban Modern space with grey laminate flooring, think in layers — raw meets refined.

**Furniture:**

* Choose **streamlined sofas** in velvet, leather, or linen.  
* Opt for **metal-framed coffee tables** or industrial-style sideboards.  
* Mix wood and metal finishes — for example, a reclaimed wood dining table with matt black legs.  

**Lighting:**

* Oversized pendant lights or geometric chandeliers add visual impact.  
* Track lighting or exposed bulbs give off that downtown loft feel.  

**Decor:**

* Add abstract artwork or black-and-white prints.  
* Use large mirrors to enhance light and give the illusion of space.  
* Rugs in muted or geometric patterns soften the floor without clashing with the grey tones.  





# 🧱 Pairing Materials & Textures

Grey laminate looks particularly striking when layered with mixed textures — a hallmark of Urban Modern design.

* **Concrete-effect walls or tiles** amplify the industrial edge.  
* **Matt black or brushed steel** fixtures keep things minimal and cohesive.  
* **Textiles** like boucle throws, leather poufs, or wool rugs balance out the hard surfaces.  

The contrast between grey flooring and warmer textures adds visual interest and prevents the space from feeling sterile.





# 🏡 Room-by-Room: Where Grey Laminate Shines

* **Living Rooms**: Acts as a neutral anchor — ideal for open-plan layouts.  
* **Bedrooms**: Soft grey tones create a peaceful retreat that pairs beautifully with layered bedding and accent lighting.  
* **Kitchens**: Pair grey floors with flat-front cabinets in white, navy, or matt black for a sleek, functional look.  
* **Home Offices**: Grey flooring creates a calm, focused space that isn’t distracting — perfect for productivity.  





# ✨ Final Word: Grey Laminate for City Style Living

Grey laminate flooring isn’t just a passing trend — it’s a design essential for modern urban spaces. Whether you’re decorating a penthouse, a studio flat, or a family home in the suburbs, this flooring choice provides a **sophisticated foundation** that adapts to your style.

Its blend of visual appeal, practicality, and affordability makes it a win-win — especially when combined with the timeless look of Urban Modern interiors.

I work in an office complex, there’s multiple small buildings and they each have between one to three businesses inside. So in my building a new business moved in about a year ago, I’m not very chatty so my usual interactions with the people from the other office are usually just greetings and such.

I would say I’m a bit introverted and I struggle with being able to keep a conversation going. I challenge myself to make small talk here and there when I see an opportunity, especially when it comes to compliments.

I think I might have made the mistake of complimenting this older gentleman in the neighboring office. Gave him a compliment on the shoes he was wearing, I genuinely liked them. And since then we’ve chatted a bit here and there when we run into each other passing by the halls or outside on a smoke break. To clarify I’m in my early 20s and this guy must be in his 60s or such. 

A couple of weeks ago he invited me to get coffee with him. Not really a question, just said “we’ll get coffee next week” and I just kinda nodded as I walked away to my car. Well ever since that every time that I see him he mentions the coffee and I just have to say “oh I’m so busy I really haven’t had time”. He had also jokingly invited me to go on a trip with him, which is when I realized oh maybe I shouldn’t be talking to this guy. And this past week he asked me if I’m off on certain days cause he has noticed that my car isn’t there on those days. 

This started out as a way for me to get out of my comfort zone and familiarize myself with the people that I see pretty often. Now I just have a nasty feeling anytime I go out to the halls. I don’t want to run into him anymore. 

He hasn’t really said or done anything inappropriate but I’m just looking to see if anyone could give some advice cause I’ve never dealt with something like this and I know that if I tell my siblings or my parents they’re going to freak out.",1,1750221647.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I stepped through the sliding doors into the freezing office of HumanTech, Inc.—a gray brick building with no windows and buzzing fluorescent lighting. 

Management kept the air conditioning blasting to keep the servers from overheating. They reprimanded me last week for bringing a hoodie from home, as all clothing needed to have the HumanTech logo. I would have to purchase the jacket with company credits. I’d need to work overtime to make up for the lost income. Otherwise, I would lose my right to housing and have to go back to the Department of Labor Resources. 

If no jobs were available, they’d throw me in prison for the worst kind of labor. People who went to prison never came out the same, if they ever came out at all. Most disappeared forever once they sank that low. I couldn’t fail at this. I had no choice but to move forward.

I paid another five credits for overbrewed coffee that looked like tar. The heat melted the sides of the foam cup, breaking bubbles on the surface. I put a lid on the beverage and carefully approached my desk. 

I scanned my retina into the system, and the computer whirred as it sluggishly booted up. The screen loaded, starting a dozen applications, all of which took their sweet time to load.

“*Come the fuck on,*” I muttered under my breath, making sure my headset was off. A quiet rebellion, one of the last still allowed. The last thing I needed was HumanTech to dock my pay for profanity. The apps came to life, designed to keep track of my every move and breath. Cameras swiveled everywhere, from this office to my Spartan, company-approved living quarters. I grumbled under my breath. But it could be worse. I could do hard labor in a wellness camp instead.

Management made our desks stand only to fight obesity rates. A stationary stair climber waited under my desk like a threat. They required us to hit a minimum of 5,000 steps daily, or they would increase our health insurance premiums and deduct the amount from our credits. And they expected us to make these steps between calls.

My headset rang before my computer fully booted up. Static crackled on the line.

“Human Tech Services, this is Karen speaking. How may I help you?” 

“Karen. You said your name is Karen?” an elderly voice chirped through static on the other side of the phone.

I rolled my eyes; I knew all the jokes surrounding my name, and was not in the mood. My computer dinged. “Make sure you smile. We do not permit eye-rolling. Our members are important to us.” I forced a smile. “Make sure the smile reaches your eyes. We can always tell. Service with a smile, our customers can hear it.” I slammed on my mouse, minimizing the app.

“Yes, my name is Karen. This call is monitored for quality assurance. How can I help?”

“Thank you, Karen. I’m sorry I’m hard of hearing, but I need your help, please!” 

My stomach dropped as I heard desperation in the older woman’s voice.

“Certainly, I’ll see what I can do. But I need your name and file number.”

“I don’t know my file number, but I can give you my name. It’s Edith Meyer.”

“Thank you, Mrs. Meyer. I..I will need something more specific, a date of birth.”

“June 14, 1984. Please!”

I searched the system and breathed a sigh of relief to find only one Edith Meyer with that specific birthdate. Her file sat in front of me. It detailed her entire life. Every click, every search, every swipe of data stood before me.

“I have your file. How can I assist you?” I asked.

“My smart vehicle is out of control. I asked it to drive me to the grocery store, and it was going on its route, but then, before it turned on the correct street, all the doors locked, and it sped to an undisclosed location. Ma’am, I’m moving so fast, I’m scared. Help me.”

“What is the make and model of your vehicle?” I asked.

“What does this matter? 2055HumantechSUV Alto.”

My heart pounded against my ribs as I pulled up my troubleshooting manual. The page slowly loaded while my AI chirped at me for the long silence.

“Thank you for holding, Mrs. Meyer. Let’s walk through some troubleshooting steps,” I said, trying to hide the shaking in my voice.

“My car almost ran into someone on the highway!” A horn honked in the background.

“Did you try to switch it to manual-”

I gritted my teeth. The troubleshooting steps were asinine, and every minute counted. It had already been five minutes, and that was too long.

“Karen, that’s the first thing I did. Can you remote in and stop this thing?”

“I wish I could, but we don’t have that ability.”

I suggested an override switch to the back office months ago, but they denied it as it would cause too much disruption to system efficiency. I wanted to scream.

Edith sobbed on the other end of the line.

“Have you tried turning the power off or hitting the emergency brake?”

“Yes, I’ve tried both and nothing.”

I searched the operator manual but found nothing to stop the runaway smart SUV. The call passed ten minutes. I’d get docked for holdtime, butt I couldn’t let her die.

“Ma’am, I’m going to need to put you on a brief hold,” I said.

“Please don’t leave me!”

“I can keep you on the line, but I need to contact the help desk. It might take a few minutes.”

Edith sobbed through the muzak. Fifteen minutes passed like a lifetime. I winced as I glared at the hold time. 

“Hello, this is Brandon with the help desk. How can I assist you?” said a cold voice.

“Hi, it’s Karen. I have Mrs. Edith Myer on the line with me. Her 2055 HumanTechSUV Alto is stuck in smart mode. It’s an emergency, and we must remote in and stop the vehicle.”

“Oh. This is a common problem,” said Brandon, matter-of-factly. “Let me pull up her file.”

After a few more minutes of sobbing and hold music, Bandon picked up the line again. “So, Mrs. Meyer, HumanTech Industries has not received paperwork that lists a caretaker since you’ve left employment.”

“What does that have to do with my out-of-control car? I need you to help.”

“Mrs. Meyer, all Smart Vehicles take you to an Elder facility if the caretaker clause is not filed within one year. You are on your way to Lakeview retreat. You will receive the best of care there.”

A cold knot formed in my stomach. In Lakeview, HumanTech sent elderly people who could no longer work and had no one to care for them. No one ever saw them again.

“Lakeview?” asked Edith through tears. “I was a nurse at Lakeview before everything changed. When we all had freedom, that’s why they want to get rid of me. Because I still remember freedom.”

Brandon asked, “Do you have any family and friends who can verbally stand in for your care?”

“We can’t send her to Lakeview!” I yelled. My AI was burning red, and I would receive coaching on my tone, but it didn’t matter. I took a deep breath. “Edith, do you have any family members or friends? Is there any way you can apply for work? Just something.”

“Karen, I need you to take a deep breath. Edith will receive wonderful care at Lakeview,” said Brandon, his voice unctuous with corporate speech.

“I don’t have anybody,” cried Edith. “I can’t work, and I’m nearly blind.”

“I’m so sorry. You will arrive at Lakeview within ninety minutes. There is no override.”

“You’re sending me there to DIE!” screamed Edith.

“This call is over. You’re no longer productive, and we all die eventually.”

The line went dead, and a cold stone formed in my stomach. My chat box lit up with the name Brandon Foster.

: PLEASE AVOID TRANSFERRING CALLS TO MY DEPARTMENT. THE EMOTIONAL OUTBURST WAS UNCALLED FOR AS WELL:

What would you say if that were your mother? I was trying to care for her.:

: Edith has already served her function. Lakeview will harvest her organs for reuse and provide her with a free cremation service.:

: You’re a sociopath.:

I’m also your supervisor. I need you to take five minutes to meditate and do what you need to do to serve your purpose. Otherwise, we can look into the reassignment of duties. :

I wanted to flip my desk, scream, and break something, but I swallowed it down. My phone beeped, and I thought of warmth as tears welled up, but I smiled.

I've noticed some of the rooms looks hazy after I've waxed and mentioned it but the new super said he'd rinsed the floor twice. 
I made sure I cleaned out my wax bucket and got a new waxing head before I did any other rooms. It was smooth sailing for a few rooms. But there's a few classrooms that have been stripped. I've noticed there's some footprints still in the room that belong to the lower supervisor. He stated they'd wax out. They didn't. I didn't think they would but he came from another school and has been doing this work 15 hears he said. So I've been following his lead. 
But I've noticed in the stripped rooms, that there's always his footprints left in the room, I'm not sure if they've been pressed into old wax he didn't get off all the way, or just imprinted there from leftover stripper that isn't being rinsed throughly. 

But that brings me to tonight. I waxed a room. I got one coat on it last night before clock out, and then 2 more today. When we went in to check it, some areas looked like the wax had just been splattered down. Almost like someone spilled hot coffee on it, and the spill was shiny but the area around it wasn't. I asked the supervisor if there being leftover stripper on the floor could cause this, but he claimed he'd never seen a floor do that before. Then he said he bet it was where the rinse water was ""splattered down"". But that's mopped on. 


I've never dealt with stripper, we didn't use it the 2 years since I've been hired. I know I put 3 even coats on that room, and have no clue why it would do that. 

Any thoughts? Am I somehow waxing it wrong or was it a badly rinsed floor and stripper that caused to to separate in a splatter pattern?
There have been other rooms that have had circle spots appear in the wax for some reason, but supposedly it was rinsed well too.",1,1750221148.0,Custodians,0,1.0,False

I currently work as a remote front-end developer on the DTV visa in Thailand.  
  
I have visited Vietnam 3 times since last year and I really love it, made a lot of friends and I notice I am just happier there. There is unfortunately no digital nomad visa as we all know, and I think hopping border every 3 months is risky (nowadays).

I was thinking of 3 options to make it possible to go to Vietnam.

**Option 1:**  
I work 1 - 2 days for very low/free, I don't mind, as a developer in a company (I could teach english too but I enjoy developing). The other days I work for my remote job. I am not sure if there are many  part time positions, or companies willing to sponsor someone for part time, hence the very low pay / work for free. Basically like an intern haha.   
  
*If anyone is looking for a dev lmk! Looking to stay in HCMC.*  
  
**Option 2:**  
I read that there are companies that act like a payroll and they will get you a work permit / TRC.  
I did read that it is a bit of a gray area, also they take about 30-35% of your pay (incl taxes).

**Option 3 (quite sketchy):**  
I see these posts on Facebook regarding getting a 2 year TRC. I chatted with one and they said it will cost $3000.   
$3000 / 24 = $125 a month which didn't seem too bad to me honestly.  
I assume they get the documents via coffee money, but I am not quite sure how this would work. Also im not sure if it could land you in potential trouble / if it is a scam.

Does anyone else know any other options, or do these options seem not feasible / stupid?

Our members are important to us.” I forced a smile. “Make sure the smile reaches your eyes. We can always tell. Service with a smile, our customers can hear it.” I slammed on my mouse, minimizing the app.

“Yes, my name is Karen. This call is monitored for quality assurance. How can I help?”

“Thank you, Karen. I’m sorry I’m hard of hearing, but I need your help, please!” 

My stomach dropped as I heard desperation in the older woman’s voice.

“Certainly, I’ll see what I can do. But I need your name and file number.”

“I don’t know my file number, but I can give you my name. It’s Edith Meyer.”

“Thank you, Mrs. Meyer. I.. I’m going to need something more specific, a date of birth.”

“June 14, 1984. Please!”

I searched the system and breathed a sigh of relief to find only one Edith Meyer with that specific birthdate. Her file sat in front of me. It detailed her entire life. Every click, every search, every swipe of data stood before me.

“I have your file. How can I assist you?” I asked.

“My smart vehicle is out of control. I asked it to drive me to the grocery store, and it was going on its route, but then, before it turned on the correct street, all the doors locked, and it sped to an undisclosed location. Ma’am, I’m moving so fast, I’m scared. Help me.”

“What is the make and model of your vehicle?” I asked.

“What does this matter? 2055HumantechSUV Alto.”

My heart pounded against my ribs as I pulled up my troubleshooting manual. The page slowly loaded while my AI chirped at me for the long silence.

“Thank you for holding, Mrs. Meyer. Let’s walk through some troubleshooting steps,” I said, trying to hide the shaking in my voice.

“My car almost ran into someone on the highway!” A horn honked in the background.

“Did you try to switch it to manual-”

I gritted my teeth. The troubleshooting steps were asinine, and every minute in counted. It had already been five minutes, and that was too long.

“Karen, that’s the first thing I did. Can you remote in and stop this thing?”

“I wish I could, but we don’t have that ability.”

I submitted a suggestion for an override switch to the back office months ago, but they denied it as it would cause too much disruption to system efficiency. I wanted to scream.

Edith sobbed on the other end of the line.

“Have you tried turning the power off or hitting the emergency brake?”

“Yes, I’ve tried both and nothing.”

I frantically searched through the operator manual but found nothing to stop the runaway smart SUV. The call passed ten minutes. I’d get docked for hold time-but I couldn’t let her die.

“Ma’am, I’m going to need to put you on a brief hold,” I said.

“Please don’t leave me!”

“I can keep you on the line, but I need to reach out to the help desk. It might take a few minutes.”

Edith sobbed through the muzak. Fifteen minutes passed like a lifetime. I winced as I glared at the holdtime. 

“Hello, this is Brandon, with the help desk. How can I assist?” said a cold voice.

“Hi, it’s Karen. I have Mrs. Edith Myer on the line with me, and her 2055HumanTechSUV Alto is stuck in smart mode. It’s an emergency, and we need to remote in and stop the vehicle.”

“Oh. This is a common problem,” said Brandon, matter-of-factly. “Let me pull up her file.”

After a few more minutes of sobbing and hold music, Bandon picked up the line again. “So, Mrs. Meyer, HumanTech Industries has yet to receive paperwork that lists a caretaker since you’ve left employment.”

“What does that have to do with my car being out of control? I need you to help.”

“Mrs. Meyer, all Smart Vehicles take you to an Elder facility if the caretaker clause is not filed within one year. You are on your way to Lakeview retreat. You will receive the best of care there.”

A cold knot formed in my stomach. Lakeview was where HumanTech sent elderly people who could no longer work and had no one to care for them. No one ever saw them again.

“Lakeview?” asked Edith through tears. “I was a nurse at Lakeview before everything changed. When we all had freedom, that’s why they want to get rid of me. Because I still remember freedom.”

“Do you have any family and friends that can verbally stand in for your care?” asked Brandon.

“We can’t send her to Lakeview!” I yelled. My AI burning red, I would receive coaching on my tone, but it didn’t matter. I took a deep breath. “Edith, do you have any family members at all, any friends? Is there any way you can apply for work? Just something.”

“Karen, I need you to take a deep breath. Edith will receive wonderful care at Lakeview,” said Brandon, his voice unctuous with corporate speech.

“I don’t have anybody,” cried Edith. “I can’t work, and I’m nearly blind.”

“I’m so sorry. You will arrive at Lakeview within ninety minutes. There is no override.”

“You’re sending me there to DIE!” screamed Edith.

“This call is over. You’re no longer productive and we all die eventually.”

The line went dead, and a cold stone formed in my stomach. My chat box lit up with the name Brandon Foster.

: PLEASE AVOID TRANSFERRING CALLS TO MY DEPARTMENT. THE EMOTIONAL OUTBURST WAS UNCALLED FOR AS WELL:

What would you say if that were your mother? I was trying to care for her.:

: Edith has already served her function. Lakeview will harvest her organs for reuse and provide her with a free cremation service.:

: You’re a sociopath.:

I’m also your supervisor. I need you to take five minutes to meditate and do what you need to do to serve your purpose. Otherwise, we can look into the reassignment of duties. :

I wanted flip my desk, scream, break something- but I swallowed it down. My phone beeped, and I thought of warmth as tears welled up but I smiled.

First came awareness of discomfort—wrists and ankles bound tightly to what felt like a metal chair, the cold surface pressing against his back with unforgiving precision. Then sound—the distant hum of what might be generators or ventilation systems, the occasional creak of metal expanding or contracting in the night air. Finally, sight—as his eyes adjusted to the gloom, the cavernous space of what appeared to be an abandoned warehouse materialized around him like a theater set slowly being illuminated.

High ceilings with exposed rafters stretched overhead, rust-colored beams crisscrossing in complex patterns that reminded him of the mana pathways in his own body. Concrete floors stained with oil or chemicals spread outward in all directions, their surface marked with arcane patterns of spillage that resembled ritual circles. Rusted machinery pushed against distant walls loomed like sleeping sentinels. A single bulb hanging from a chain about twenty feet away cast more shadows than light, creating pools of darkness where anything—or anyone—could hide.

Nick remained perfectly still, controlling his breathing to feign continued unconsciousness while assessing his situation. The taser had temporarily disrupted his mana flow, creating jagged, broken pathways where the blue energy should flow smoothly. But he could feel it returning now, the familiar cool current slowly reestablishing itself beneath his skin, like a river finding new channels after a dam break.

He extended his enhanced senses outward, searching for any sign of his captors. No breathing patterns, no heartbeats, no subtle shifts of weight that would betray human presence. The warehouse appeared completely empty except for him.

Extending his awareness further, Nick detected no signs of life within several hundred yards—just the ambient sounds of wind through broken windows and the distant calls of crickets. Wherever they had taken him, it was isolated.

*Why leave me unguarded?* Nick murmured to himself, finally opening his eyes fully. The blue energy pulsed once in response to his question, as if equally confused by the situation.

The restraints binding him to the chair were professional-grade—thick zip ties that cut into his skin when he tested their strength. But why bring him all this way only to abandon him?

Unless...

Nick shifted his awareness inward, using the mana to scan his own body. The energy responded instantly, flowing through his system like a living medical scanner, revealing abnormalities his normal senses could never detect. Areas where the blue energy pulsed with agitated intensity appeared throughout his body, particularly around his internal organs. Unlike the food reaction, which had triggered an immediate warning response, this was different—subtler, more insidious.

*They've poisoned me,* he realized, watching through his mind's eye as the blue energy mapped out contaminated pathways within his body. Not to kill—at least, not immediately—but to incapacitate, to weaken, perhaps to test.

The poison wasn't crude—it worked in layers, subtle and slow, like it was designed to be noticed only if you were paying attention. Or if your body fought back like his did. The mana revealed it as dark, sluggish areas in his energy field—places where the natural flow was interrupted or corrupted.

But why no guards? No cameras? No restraints beyond zip ties?

Whoever brought him here hadn't cared what happened next.

*Maybe that's the point,* Nick thought grimly. *Isolation. Poison. Let fate—or whatever lives in me—decide.*

Which meant…

Either someone expected him to die quietly out here. Or someone wanted him far away when things went down on campus.

Nick focused on the areas where the mana showed the greatest agitation—his liver, kidneys, heart, and certain neural pathways. The poison was methodical—disrupting, weakening. But wherever he concentrated his mana flow to those areas, the corruption cracked and dissolved, shards of darkness in his energy field breaking apart under the steady pressure of blue light, and strength gradually returned to that area.

His body was fighting back, using the mana as both a detection system and a remedy.

Nick closed his eyes, centering himself despite the discomfort of the restraints. The chair's cold metal against his back faded from awareness as he turned his full attention inward, mapping his body's energy system with growing precision.

Drawing on the meditation techniques taught to him by Arlize and his dad, Nick directed the mana flow deliberately to his liver first. The blue energy responded, concentrating there with heightened intensity, pulsing with a steady rhythm that matched his heartbeat. Each wave of energy washed through the organ, dissolving the poison's effects like salt in water. For twenty minutes, he maintained this focus, feeling the poison's effects diminish as the mana neutralized its components.

Next, he directed the energy to his kidneys, visualizing the blue light flowing through the filtering systems, carrying away impurities and restoring natural function. Then his cardiovascular system, the mana racing alongside his blood cells, purifying each vessel it touched. Methodically cleansing each area. The process was exhausting, requiring a level of concentration he'd never attempted before, but gradually he felt strength returning to his weakened body.

Hours passed as he worked through his system. Outside, darkness deepened, moonlight occasionally breaking through clouds to cast silver rectangles on the warehouse floor through broken skylights. The light created momentary patterns that mirrored the mana pathways flowing through him—geometric perfection in both the natural world and his internal energy system. Still no sign of his captors, though Nick remained certain they were monitoring him somehow—cameras or biosensors too subtle for even his enhanced perception to detect.

As he directed the cleansing mana through his nervous system, Nick took mental inventory of his possessions. His backpack with Maggie's equipment had been left in his dorm, thankfully. But the phone that had been in his pocket when they grabbed him was missing—either confiscated or destroyed. Without it, contacting anyone for help would be challenging, but it also meant one less way for them to track him.

By the time he'd completed the cleansing of his system, Nick estimated at least five hours had passed. Midnight, perhaps later. His body felt stronger now, the foreign substance largely neutralized, though fatigue from the intense mana work left him drained. The blue energy flowed more sluggishly than usual, like a battery running low after excessive use.

*Now for the restraints.*

In his previous attempts with mana manipulation, Nick had focused on defensive and sensory applications. But Arlize's memories contained offensive techniques as well—including the ability to generate intense heat through concentrated energy.

As Nick sank deep into himself, drawing on the wellspring of mana that connected him to Arlize's consciousness, the memory unfolded with vivid clarity:

*—Arlize, chained in the dungeons beneath Kieroth's fortress after being captured by Lord Malek's forces. The cell smelled of mold and human suffering, the air thick with despair and the lingering screams of previous occupants. For three days, they had tortured him, seeking information about Aurilia's defense plans. On the fourth day, when the guards had grown complacent, Arlize had channeled concentrated aether through the iron manacles, superheating the metal until it glowed cherry-red, weakening enough for him to break free. The sound of the chains shattering had echoed through the dungeon like thunder, but by then it was too late for the guards to stop him.*

""Heat follows intent,"" Arlize's mentor had taught him, his wizened face illuminated by the blue glow emanating from his hands as he demonstrated the technique. ""Direct it with precision, and even metal will yield.""

Nick focused on that memory and channeled the mana into a thread-thin filament along the zip tie's edge. Unlike his earlier attempts at manifesting energy, where the blue light had flared wildly, this time it formed an almost surgical tool—a testament to his growing finesse. The energy concentrated into a hair-thin line of brilliant blue light, so intense it was almost white at its core, resembling a laser more than flame.

The plastic began to smoke, then melt, without burning his skin. The control felt natural now, like remembering a skill his body had always known rather than learning something new. Not new. Recovered. Like the knowledge had been waiting in his bones. He could use this again. He would.

*""Integration,""* he thought, recognizing this as what his mother had once called the third stage of mana development: when practitioner and energy move as one. The memory surfaced with startling clarity—his mother kneeling beside him in their family dojo, her hands glowing with the same blue light now emanating from his own fingertips. ""First comes awakening,"" she had explained. ""Then control. Then integration—when the mana becomes not something you use, but something you are.""

With a final surge of effort, Nick flexed his wrist and the zip tie snapped, the severed ends falling away. One hand free, he quickly released his other wrist, the mana responding more fluidly now to his intentions. The blue energy pulsed with satisfaction, as if pleased to be working in harmony with his conscious mind. Then he bent to free his ankles, the plastic restraints yielding easily to his focused power.

Standing proved challenging, his legs unsteady after hours of immobility and mana exertion, but he forced himself upright, scanning the warehouse more thoroughly now. The blue energy enhanced his vision in the darkness, allowing him to perceive details that would be invisible to normal sight.

The building was larger than he'd initially assessed—perhaps an old manufacturing facility or distribution center. Abandoned equipment loomed in shadows, their silhouettes suggesting machinery designed for processing or packaging agricultural products. Loading bay doors lined one wall, massive rusted panels that hadn't been opened in years. An office area was visible in the far corner, its windows shattered, papers long since scattered by wind and weather.

Nick moved cautiously toward what appeared to be the main entrance, his senses extended for any sign of surveillance or traps. The mana flowed outward from his body in subtle waves, detecting electromagnetic fields and energy signatures that normal perception would miss. Finding none, he eased the heavy door open and stepped outside.

Cool night air washed over him, carrying the scent of soil and growing crops. Stars blazed overhead in an unfamiliar pattern—away from campus and the city's light pollution. In every direction, farmland stretched to the horizon, punctuated only by the occasional distant light from what might be farmhouses. The landscape was bathed in silver moonlight that created an otherworldly landscape of shadows and illumination.

""Miles from anywhere,"" Nick muttered, trying to orient himself. The mana responded to his uncertainty, flowing upward to enhance his perception of the night sky. Constellations brightened in his vision, the patterns revealing directional information that helped him establish his approximate location.

Without his phone or any other technology, determining his exact location was impossible. The moon pointed west, suggesting he was somewhere east of campus, but that told him little about how far they had taken him or the best route back.

A strategic assessment of his options yielded limited choices. Wandering unfamiliar farmland in darkness invited injury or further disorientation. Remaining outside made him visible to any observers. The warehouse, while exposed, at least offered shelter and familiarity.

He slipped back inside and locked the door—not because it would stop anyone, but because it gave him control over something. If they were coming back, they'd have to break down the door. And that, at least, would make noise. Until then, his best course was to recover his strength through rest and preparation.

He found a defensible position in the office area where he could observe all approaches while remaining partially concealed. Then, settling into a cross-legged position that Arlize had often used during extended campaigns, Nick entered a meditative state designed to maximize recovery while maintaining awareness of his surroundings.

*Four counts in. Hold for seven. Out for eight.*

The mana surged like cold fire through his system, pulsing with each controlled breath. Every surge carried a sting—as if burning out infection. Not healing. Cleansing. A purge in motion. Blue light traced the pathways through his body, flowing faster with each cycle, scouring away the last remnants of poison.

As his mind cleared, Nick analyzed his situation more thoroughly.

This wasn't surveillance. It was something else.

An escalation, yes—but to what end, he couldn't say. There were no guards. No equipment. No obvious signs of data collection. Just a remote warehouse, a drugged body, and too many unanswered questions.

If it was meant as an experiment, it lacked structure. If it was meant as an execution, it lacked finality. Maybe that was the plan—ambiguous by design. A test of how far he could fall. Or how far he could go.

Nick clenched his fists. Fury prickled beneath his skin—not just at whoever had done this, but at himself, for letting it happen. Again. The blue energy responded to his anger, forming jagged patterns beneath his skin that resembled lightning, ready to strike out at threats.

But anger wouldn't serve him now. He needed clarity. Strategy. The mana calmed as he pushed aside emotion, returning to the smooth, flowing patterns that enhanced his strength and perception.

He was still here, and his escape would force them to recalibrate their assessment of his capabilities—potentially revealing more about their objectives and methods than they had intended. That was the advantage he needed to press.

Nick maintained his meditative state through the night, allowing his body to recover while his mind processed possibilities. The blue energy cycled through his system, restoring and replenishing his depleted resources.

When the first gray light of dawn filtered through broken windows, he sensed no approach or surveillance. Rising smoothly, he conducted a final sweep of the warehouse, searching for any clue about its location or his abductors' identities.

In the office area, he discovered a faded shipping label stuck to a dusty desk: ""Meridian Agricultural Supply, County Road 27, Willow Creek."" The name meant nothing to him, but it offered a starting point.

Exiting through a side door, Nick oriented himself toward the rising sun and began walking. The mana flowed to his muscles, enhancing his endurance and strength for the journey ahead. A dirt access road eventually connected to a paved county road with no visible traffic. The morning air was cool, heavy with dew that soaked his shoes as he established a steady pace that Arlize could maintain for hours.

For nearly four miles, he encountered nothing but farmland—corn and soybean fields stretching in every direction. By mid-morning, Nick reached a sleepy crossroads—gas station, diner, and a faded sign: Willow Creek, Pop. 427.

Nick approached the gas station first, its fluorescent lights humming in the morning quiet. The attendant—a heavyset man in his sixties with a weathered face and suspicious eyes—looked up from his newspaper as Nick entered.

The man glanced at the wall clock that read 7:37 AM, looked back at Nick and asked, ""You need something?""

""Just got a bit turned around,"" Nick replied, keeping his tone casual. ""Can you tell me how far it is to Westlake University from here?""

The man's eyebrows rose slightly. ""That'd be about a hundred miles northeast. You're a long way from campus, son.""

A hundred miles. They'd transported him much farther than he'd anticipated. Getting back would require transportation and time—both in short supply. The blue energy pulsed with renewed urgency, sensing the challenge ahead.

""Is there a bus service or something similar?"" Nick asked.

""Greyhound stops at the Miller's store in town proper, but not till 3 PM."" The attendant studied Nick more carefully now, noting his disheveled appearance. Eyes narrowing, he asked, ""You got money for a ticket, kid?""

Nick patted his pockets, confirming what he already knew—his wallet was gone along with his phone. ""Not on me,"" he admitted.

The attendant's expression hardened. ""This ain't a charity, and I don't need trouble.""

""No trouble,"" Nick assured him, mind racing through options. He could attempt to call Maggie, but the attendant would likely be suspicious of someone using the store phone without making a purchase. Besides, any call might be monitored, especially from this location.

The bell above the door jingled as another customer entered—an older man in overalls and a worn baseball cap, his face deeply lined from years of sun exposure. The mana flowed to Nick's senses, assessing the newcomer automatically—no threat signature, just the steady energy field of an ordinary human.

""Morning, Pete,"" the farmer nodded to the attendant, then glanced curiously at Nick. ""Early for college kids to be out this way.""

Nick recognized an opportunity. ""Actually, I was hoping to catch a ride back toward Westlake. My car broke down a few miles back, and I've got classes today.""

The farmer sized him up with weathered gray eyes that seemed to look straight through Nick's casual facade. For a moment, Nick worried his mana might be visible somehow, but the man's expression showed only practical consideration.

""Westlake's a fair piece. I'm heading to Riverdale to deliver some equipment parts—that's about thirty miles in that direction. Can take you that far if it helps.""

""That would be great, thank you,"" Nick said, relief evident in his voice.

The farmer paid for his coffee and gestured for Nick to follow him outside to a battered pickup truck loaded with machinery parts. As they pulled away from the gas station, Nick caught the attendant watching them through the window, phone in hand.

*Reporting my presence,* Nick thought, the blue energy pulsing in warning. *But to whom?*

""Name's Earl,"" the farmer said as they turned onto the main road. ""Don't normally pick up strangers, but you don't look like trouble. Just stranded.""

""Nick. And I appreciate the ride more than you know.""

The truck smelled of motor oil, farm dust, and tobacco. Comfortingly ordinary. After the sterile emptiness of the warehouse, even that was a balm. As they drove, Nick studied road signs and landmarks, building a mental map. The farmer seemed content with silence, occasionally commenting on crop conditions or weather patterns but he didn't question Nick's circumstances.

Riverdale proved to be a larger town with a regional bus terminal. Earl dropped him at the station with a gruff nod and firm handshake.

""Terminal's got a Western Union if you need to call someone for money,"" he offered before driving away.

Nick considered his options. The terminal was busier than the gas station had been—too many people, too many security cameras, too much potential for monitoring. If Callahan Industries had the resources to abduct him from campus, they certainly had the capability to track him through transportation networks.

The TV mounted in the bus station's waiting area cycled through news headlines. Nick paid little attention as he headed to the station bathroom until a familiar name caught his ear.

""...unexplained explosion at the Callahan Industries research facility in Zurich has raised questions about experimental research being conducted there. Callahan's spokesperson denied allegations of unsafe testing procedures, while rival tech CEO Marcus Eidolon has called for increased oversight of neural interface experiments...""

The camera cut to a silver-haired man with intense blue eyes—the same man from the conference photo Nick had found. Eidolon spoke with measured precision about ""concerning patterns of accidents"" and ""the need for ethical boundaries in consciousness research."" But what chilled Nick was the ticker scrolling beneath: ""Related: Three researchers previously employed by Dr. Elias Zhang reported missing after this incident.""

Nick paused, the blue energy pulsing with recognition. This explosion wasn't just an accident—it was connected to Maggie's brother and whatever research he had been conducting before his disappearance. The timing couldn't be coincidental. Something was accelerating in the shadow war between Callahan and Eidolon, and somehow Nick had been thrust into the middle of it.

In the station restroom, Nick assessed his appearance—dirty clothes, disheveled hair, the lingering pallor of someone recovering from an illness. In short, he looked miserable. He cleaned up as best he could with paper towels and hand soap, getting some water in his hair before returning to the main terminal area.

A security guard eyed him suspiciously but said nothing as Nick approached the information desk.

""When's the next bus to Westlake University?"" he asked the clerk.

""9:30 AM, and arrive at 1:45 PM,"" she replied. ""One-way is $27.50.""

Nick nodded, then moved away from the counter. Without money, the bus wasn't an option unless he used the Western Union, which would create a paper trail. His status as a missing person might work in his favor—he could potentially approach a police officer and report his kidnapping, but that would trigger official investigations that might complicate his information gathering.

As he walked away, he noticed the security cameras tracking movement throughout the terminal. Each scan sent a subtle electromagnetic pulse that tingled against his heightened senses—another new awareness that had emerged since his mana work in the warehouse. The cameras' energy signatures registered as faint, pulsing nodes in his enhanced perception, their scanning patterns visible as waves of light that normal eyes could never detect.

He inhaled deeply, recalling how Arlize had concealed himself on scouting missions behind enemy lines. Drawing the mana inward, Nick compressed it into a tight core at his center, visualizing his energy signature shrinking from a beacon to a whisper. The blue light condensed into a dense sphere at his solar plexus, its radiance contained rather than projected.

The next security scan passed over him without triggering the familiar tingle. The cameras still saw him physically, but the electronic detection systems that might flag unusual energy patterns would register nothing distinctive. It wasn't perfect, and he couldn't hold it indefinitely—the compression of mana required constant focus and drained his energy quickly. But it was good enough for now.

Looking around the terminal, he weighed his options on what to do next, and as he did so, he spotted a campus security vehicle from Riverdale Community College pulling into the station lot. The officer inside was dropping off what appeared to be a student. A potential solution formed in Nick's mind.

When the officer returned to his vehicle, Nick approached with the confident stride of someone with legitimate business.

""Excuse me, Officer,"" he called. ""I'm a student at Westlake University. There was an incident on campus last night—I was attacked and woke up miles from campus. Is there any way you could help me contact Westlake security?""

The officer—Ramirez, according to his nameplate—studied Nick with professional assessment. ""You file a report with local PD yet?""

""No sir, I just made it to town and wanted to contact campus first. I'm supposed to testify at a disciplinary hearing today."" The lie came smoothly, calculated to appeal to another campus officer's sense of institutional procedures.

Officer Ramirez considered for a moment, then gestured to his vehicle. ""I can radio it in, see if they've got a report matching your description. What's your name?""

""Nick Valiente. I'm a freshman in the business program.""

The officer typed something into his vehicle's computer, waited, then picked up his radio. After a brief exchange, he turned back to Nick with a more serious expression.

""Westlake Security confirms they've got a missing person report with your name filed about two hours ago. They're sending a vehicle to pick you up. Should be here in about forty minutes.""

Nick felt a surge of surprise—someone had reported him missing already. Jordan? Maggie? Or perhaps Callahan Industries themselves, establishing a cover story? The blue energy within him pulsed with renewed alertness, sensing that events were accelerating beyond his control.

While waiting, Officer Ramirez insisted on taking preliminary information for his own department's report, though he agreed to wait on filing until Westlake Security arrived. Nick provided a carefully edited version of events—attacked while walking to the gym, waking up in an abandoned building, finding his way to town—omitting any mention of mana or deliberate poisoning.

When the Westlake Security vehicle arrived, the officer who stepped out was unfamiliar to Nick—a stocky man with a military haircut and too-alert eyes for standard campus security.

""Mr. Valiente? I'm Officer Dawson. We've been looking for you."" His tone was professional but his gaze lingered on Nick's face too long, assessing rather than concerned.

*Not standard security,* Nick concluded, the mana providing subtle readings of the man's energy signature. *Another military personnel.* But something was off. Something about the way Dawson spoke made Nick's mana hum faintly—not a warning, but a recognition. Like calling to like.

The drive back to campus started in tense silence, Dawson's eyes frequently finding Nick in the rearview mirror. The countryside passed in a blur of autumn colors, farms gradually giving way to suburbs, then the outskirts of the university town.

""You seem remarkably resilient,"" Dawson observed after several minutes, his accent carrying the faintest hint of something not quite American—perhaps South American, though Nick didn't immediately register its significance. ""Most people wouldn't recover so quickly from what you experienced.""

""I've always healed fast,"" Nick replied carefully, the blue energy beneath his skin pulsing in response to the potential threat of discovery.

""A family trait, perhaps?"" Dawson's eyes met his in the rearview mirror, holding for a beat too long, a knowing gleam in their depths that sent warning signals through Nick's system.

""You could say that."" Nick kept his tone neutral, but his senses were on high alert, the mana flowing to his eyes and ears to enhance his perception of every micro-expression, every subtle shift in Dawson's body language.

Dawson nodded slowly. ""Interesting.""

As they drove, Dawson received a text message. Nick caught only a glimpse of the screen—the words ""Harrington"" and ""protocol"" visible before Dawson quickly tucked the phone away. His posture shifted subtly, a new tension in his shoulders that hadn't been there before.

""Big evening ahead,"" Dawson commented, seemingly casual. ""I hear there's an important lecture happening at Willard Hall later.""

""Professor Harrington's neural interface presentation,"" Nick replied, watching Dawson's reaction carefully. The mana enhanced his perception, revealing the slight acceleration in Dawson's pulse when the lecture was mentioned.

""Yes, that's the one."" Dawson's fingers tightened almost imperceptibly on the steering wheel. ""Quite the breakthrough in the field, from what I understand. The kind of research that changes everything.""

The conversation then turned to more direct questions about Nick's abduction—how much he remembered, what he might have seen or heard. Nick maintained his simplified narrative, presenting himself as confused and somewhat traumatized but cooperative. All the while, the blue energy inside him remained tightly controlled, compressed into that dense core at his center, hidden from whatever detection methods Dawson might be employing.

When they finally arrived at the Westlake Security office, Nick was surprised to find Professor Feldman waiting, her silver-streaked hair pulled back severely, arms crossed as she conferred with the security director. The mana flowed to his senses, automatically analyzing Feldman's energy signature—controlled, precise, with unusual patterns he'd never detected in ordinary humans.

""Mr. Valiente,"" she acknowledged, her sharp eyes cataloging every detail of his appearance. ""You've caused quite a commotion this morning.""

""Someone attacked me last night,"" Nick replied, watching her reaction carefully. ""I woke up in an abandoned warehouse miles from campus.""

""So you've said."" Feldman's tone revealed nothing. ""The director needs your statement, then you should see the campus medical center. You've missed your morning classes, but I'm sure your professors will understand given the circumstances."" Her eyes flicked to his chest—right where the taser burns lay hidden beneath his shirt. She knew more than she should, it seemed.

The security director—a balding man named Reeves with the easy confidence of former law enforcement—led Nick through a formal statement process. Photos were taken of faint electrical burns on his chest from the taser, and descriptions recorded of the warehouse and his journey back to campus.

Throughout the procedure, Nick maintained his role as confused victim while noting the strange tension in the room. Reeves seemed genuinely concerned, but Feldman watched the process with calculated intensity, as if searching for discrepancies in Nick's account. The blue energy remained tightly controlled, a compressed sphere of power that allowed him to assess others without revealing his own capabilities.

""We'll investigate thoroughly,"" Reeves assured him when they finished. ""In the meantime, we'll assign additional patrols to your dormitory area. Officer Dawson will escort you back now.""

As they left the security building, Feldman fell into step beside Nick. Her energy signature pulsed with unusual patterns—neither threatening nor friendly, but definitely not ordinary.

""Interesting timing,"" she remarked quietly. ""Coincidentally, Professor Harrington's lecture on neural interfaces is still scheduled for this evening. I assume you're still planning to attend?""

The question carried layers of meaning Nick couldn't fully decode. Was she warning him? Testing him? Something in her tone suggested personal interest rather than institutional concern.

""I wouldn't miss it,"" Nick replied carefully, the mana responding to his focused intent by enhancing his perception of Feldman's subtle reactions.

Feldman nodded once, sharply. ""Good. Some educational opportunities are irreplaceable."" With that cryptic comment, she turned and walked away, leaving Nick with Officer Dawson for the remainder of the escort to his dormitory.

The campus felt different as they crossed it—students moving between buildings as always, but now Nick noticed additional security personnel at key locations, their attentiveness belying their casual postures. His kidnapping had elevated something, accelerated some timetable he wasn't yet privy to. The blue energy within him seemed to sense the shift as well, flowing with renewed urgency beneath his skin.

When they reached his dormitory, Dawson left him at the entrance with a final assessing look. ""Take care, Mr. Valiente. Security will follow up if we have more questions.""

Nick climbed the stairs to his floor rather than taking the elevator, using the time to prepare himself for whatever awaited. Jordan's room would likely be empty, but there might be new surveillance in his own room.

To his surprise, when he entered his room, he found it meticulously clean—neater than he had left it. The electronic hum from the ceiling vent was gone, suggesting the surveillance devices had been removed. On his bed lay his missing phone, placed precisely in the center of his pillow.

Nick approached cautiously, extending his senses for any traps or new monitoring devices. The mana flowed outward in invisible waves, detecting electromagnetic fields and energy signatures throughout the room. Truly all of the surveillance equipment had been removed.

He stared at his phone sitting on his pillow.

*Yesterday he’d been poisoned, kidnapped and dragged a hundred miles from campus. Then he was dumped in an empty warehouse with poison in his veins. Then—no surveillance. No cleanup crew. Just a neatly returned phone, placed like a gift on his pillow.*

*What….just what…*

The meditation technique he’d been using to hold himself together threatened to come unglued.

*Am I going crazy or is someone actually messing with me?*

*Four counts in. Hold for seven. Out for eight.*

*Four counts in. Hold for seven. Out for eight.*

*Four counts in. Hold for seven. Out for eight.*

*Four counts in. Hold for seven. Out for eight.*

*He stared at his phone,* then slowly walked to the bed and picked it up

A single text message waited on the screen, from an unknown number:

""Meet me at Murphy's Bar downtown, 5 PM. - M.E.""

The timing couldn't be coincidental.

Someone had to be scripting this.

Looking at the text again, Nick weighed his options. Harrington's lecture started at 7 PM. What did he have to lose with meeting M.E. first—if that message was real. If any of this was.

Suddenly his phone alarm pinged, a notification for his class schedule that day.

Sighing he set the phone down and headed to the shower, wanting to wash away the lingering scent of the warehouse and clear his mind. The hot water revitalized him, the mana responding to the cleansing by flowing more freely through his system, washing away the last remnants of fatigue and poison.

Clean and dressed in fresh clothes, Nick checked the time—10:45 AM. He'd already missed Statistics, which made Feldman's presence at the security office all the more unsettling.

*She wasn't campus security,* Nick thought, the blue energy pulsing in agreement. *She had a reason to be there—sure. She was his professor, maybe even concerned about his absence. But how'd she known he was missing? What was her specific interest in him?*

Nick pushed thoughts of Professor Feldman aside. He still had forty-five minutes left of Intro to Comp Sci and Intro to Business later that afternoon. Returning to routine might be his best defense for now. Leaving his dorm, Nick scanned the parking lot, his breath pausing when he noticed the surveillance truck—the one that had been stationed there all week—was conspicuously absent.

The blue energy surged in response to this new development, heightening his senses as he surveyed the campus. Something had changed.

He picked up his pace, half-jogging across campus toward the Computer Science building, his backpack bouncing awkwardly against his spine. The lecture was already underway when Nick slipped through the door. Several heads turned, conversations momentarily hushed, and he felt the weight of curious stares.

Professor Lin paused mid-sentence, acknowledged him with a subtle nod, then smoothly resumed her lecture about algorithmic efficiency. Nick found a seat in the back row, sliding into it with as little disruption as possible.

""What did I miss?"" he whispered to the student beside him, a guy with disheveled hair and coffee-stained fingers who was typing furiously on his laptop.

""Binary search trees,"" the student murmured without looking up. ""She's about to get into worst-case scenarios.""

Nick pulled out his notebook, trying to focus on Professor Lin's diagrams projected on the screen, but his mind kept circling back to the missing surveillance truck and what its absence might mean.

1le82zb,https://i.redd.it/b48m2ehu4m7f1.jpeg,Forget Bali for a Moment — Here’s Why Pangandaran Should Be Your Next Destination,"Tired of the same Bali crowds and overpriced lattes?
Let me introduce you to Pangandaran — a coastal gem on the southern edge of West Java, Indonesia, where you can surf, hike, swim in turquoise waters, eat seafood right from the boat, and still feel like the beach belongs to you.



🌊 What Makes Pangandaran Special?
	•	Two Beaches, One Peninsula.
Pangandaran Beach faces west for stunning sunsets. East Beach is calmer—perfect for swimming, boat rides, and catching the sunrise.
	•	Green Canyon (Cukang Taneuh).
Not the US Grand Canyon, but just as magical. A river tour through lush cliffs and caves with emerald-green water. You can cliff-jump, too.
	•	Batu Karas:
A surfer’s dream spot with long mellow waves. Think Bali 20 years ago—but with warungs (local cafés) instead of fancy beach clubs.
	•	Nature Reserve & Wildlife.
Pangandaran Nature Park is home to deer, monkeys, and rare birds. You can walk through jungle trails that end at secret coves and coral cliffs.


🍽️ Food? It’s Fresh & Affordable
	•	Grilled fish caught the same day.
	•	Coconut water straight from the tree.
	•	Local street food like tahu bulat, mie glosor, and seafood satay—all cheap, spicy, and addictive.


🛏️ Where to Stay?
	•	Beachfront homestays for under $15/night.
	•	Eco-lodges in Batu Hiu with ocean views.
	•	Friendly locals who’ll invite you for morning coffee without charging for it.


🚗 How to Get There?
	•	6–7 hours drive from Bandung or Yogyakarta.
	•	Local bus or car rental is best.
	•	New roads = smoother trip than most expect.


Why You’ll Love It:
Because Pangandaran isn’t trying to be a tourist trap.
It’s real. It’s raw. It’s ridiculously beautiful.
And right now, it’s still mostly undiscovered.

So if you’re looking for your next underrated travel story,
don’t just go where everyone’s been.
Go to Pangandaran. Before everyone else does.

1le82wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1le82wt/rebirth_protocol_bk1_ch_14_the_arcadia_sleeps_no/,Rebirth Protocol - Bk1 Ch. 14 - The Arcadia sleeps No Longer,"Nick slipped into the back row of Professor Williams' Intro to Business lecture five minutes early, his senses buzzing with quiet alarm. Something was off. Not just the lingering ache in his muscles or the phantom taste of mana in his mouth—metallic with undertones of winter frost—but the classroom itself felt... wrong. Sarah and Matt's seats were empty. Not unusual on a normal day, perhaps, but today, it felt ominous.

*Huh,* Nick thought. *Tonight's either going to go really well… or it's going to be a complete disaster.*

He rubbed his eyes, a dull ache blooming behind his temples. The mana surged instinctively, soothing the tension almost as soon as it began.

The blue energy beneath his skin seemed to pulse in agreement as it flowed in subtle patterns that reflected his unease. Since his escape from the warehouse and the purging of the poison, his connection to the mana had deepened. It no longer merely responded to his conscious commands but seemed to anticipate his needs, flowing automatically to enhance.

Professor Williams entered precisely at 2:00 PM, his usual tailored suit impeccable, his movements precise as he arranged his notes on the lectern. Nick noticed immediately how the professor's gaze swept across the room, deliberately avoiding the section where Nick sat. With his mana-enhanced perception, Nick could detect subtle tension in Williams' shoulders, a too-careful control in his breathing pattern.

*He knows I'm here, but doesn't want to acknowledge it,* Nick realized.

""Today we'll be discussing market disruption through technological innovation,"" Williams began, his voice carrying the practiced cadence of someone who had delivered this lecture many times before. ""When established industries face extinction-level threats...""

Nick tried to focus on taking notes, but his mind kept circling back to the warehouse, to the poison, to the text message waiting on his neatly-placed phone. None of it felt random anymore. The blue energy beneath his skin flowed in restless currents, responding to his unease with heightened alertness.

Halfway through the lecture, Professor Williams finally—almost reluctantly—looked in Nick's direction while discussing adaptive corporate responses to external threats. Their eyes met, and for a fraction of a second, something shifted in Professor Williams' expression—a slight curl at the corner of his mouth, a knowing smirk that vanished as quickly as it had appeared.

The blue energy surged in response, flaring briefly beneath Nick's skin like lightning behind clouds. He maintained his outward composure, but inwardly his mind raced through implications and possibilities.

The professor quickly looked away, continuing his lecture without pause, but that fleeting expression confirmed what Nick had begun to suspect: Professor Williams knew something. Whether he was a player in whatever game was unfolding or merely an observer remained unclear, but he wasn't just a business professor. That much was certain.

By the time Professor Williams dismissed the class, Nick had filled his notebook with fragmentary notes, his attention too fractured to maintain coherence. As students filed out, Nick lingered, half-expecting Williams to approach him with some cryptic comment or veiled threat. Instead, the professor methodically packed his briefcase and left without another glance in Nick's direction.

*Playing it close,* Nick thought, watching Williams' retreat. *But his avoidance says as much as confrontation would have.*

Outside the Business building, Nick pulled out his phone and texted Maggie:

*I'm back on campus. Need to talk. Where are you?*

Her response came almost immediately: *Thank God. Engineering courtyard, east corner. Now.*

The engineering courtyard was a small, secluded space nestled between two modernist buildings, populated by a few concrete benches and drought-resistant plants. Maggie was waiting in the farthest corner, partially hidden by an architectural feature that created a natural blind spot from most angles.

When she saw Nick, her usual composed demeanor cracked. She rushed forward, stopping just short of hugging him, her hands hovering uncertainly before dropping back to her sides.

""I reported you missing,"" she said without preamble, her voice low and tense. ""One of my contacts in your dorm said you never made it back last night, and when you didn't show up for morning classes..."" She trailed off, studying his face. ""What happened?""

Nick glanced around, confirming they were alone before responding. His mana flowed outward in subtle waves, detecting no electronic signatures or human presence nearby.

""Someone tasered me outside the cafeteria last night,"" he said, keeping his voice low. ""I woke up in an abandoned warehouse about a hundred miles from here.""

Maggie's eyes widened. ""Fuck, Nick. Are you okay?""

""Physically, yes. They drugged me with something, but I managed to..."" Nick hesitated, still uncertain how much to reveal about his abilities. ""My system fought it off.""

""System? You mean the thing we’re not talking about?” Wiggling her fingers

""Yeah. That."" Nick nodded. The blue energy pulsed beneath his skin in confirmation, as if pleased to be acknowledged. ""It helped me break free and make my way back. But here's what's strange—they just left me there. No guards, minimal restraints. Like they wanted to see what I'd do.""

Maggie paced a small circle, her mind visibly processing the implications. ""A test, maybe? Or they needed you out of the way temporarily."" She stopped abruptly. ""You said your phone was taken. How did you get back?""

""That's another weird part. When I got back to my room, my phone was there waiting for me."" Nick pulled it out, showing her the screen with the text message. ""Along with this.""

Maggie studied the message, her dark eyes narrowing. ""M.E.? Who's that?""

""I have no idea,"" Nick admitted, the blue energy pulsing with an anticipation he couldn't fully explain. ""But apparently they want to meet at 5:00 PM.""

""That's risky,"" Maggie frowned. ""But if they're positioning against Callahan, they might be worth talking to."" She chewed her lower lip thoughtfully. ""Just be careful. This could easily be another trap.""

From her backpack, Maggie produced a pair of ordinary-looking glasses and what appeared to be a simple wristwatch. The items carried faint electromagnetic signatures that Nick's enhanced perception detected immediately—sophisticated technology disguised as common accessories.

""Take these,"" she said, handing them over. ""The glasses can detect neural interface signals—they'll show fluctuations in the visual field if someone's using tech to manipulate brainwaves. The watch monitors electromagnetic anomalies."" Her voice dropped even lower. ""If Harrington plans to demonstrate something tonight that could affect people's minds, these will warn you.""

Nick turned the devices over in his hands, impressed. “Funny. I was just thinking yesterday that I should’ve asked you for gear to help protect myself during the demo.”

Maggie smirked. “Great minds and all that.”

As his fingers brushed the surface of each device, the blue energy beneath his skin flowed into them, creating a flicker of resonance—like the tech recognized him. ""You made these?""

""Modified them,"" Maggie corrected with a hint of pride. ""The basic tech already existed. I just... enhanced it.""

""Thanks."" Nick slipped the glasses into his pocket and fastened the watch around his wrist. The device felt strangely warm against his skin, as if responding to his mana. ""I should get going. I still need to eat something before this meeting.""

Maggie nodded. ""Text me if anything happens. And Nick?"" She met his eyes with unusual intensity. ""Whatever you learn tonight—at this meeting or at Harrington's lecture—I want to know everything.""

Nick chose a small diner several blocks from campus, a place unlikely to be frequented by other students. After the events of the previous night, he couldn't bring himself to trust the campus cafeteria food. The diner was quiet at this hour, occupied only by a few elderly regulars and a harried waitress who seemed relieved when Nick ordered something simple—a burger and fries.

While waiting for his food, Nick checked his university email, surprised to find a message from Dean Whitaker flagged as ""urgent."" The subject line read: ""Regarding Last Night's Incident.""

From: Office of the Dean

To: [nvaliente@westlake.edu](mailto:nvaliente@westlake.edu)

Bcc/Cc:

Subject: Regarding Last Night's Incident

Mr. Valiente,

The University administration deeply regrets the unfortunate incident you experienced last night. While the circumstances remain under investigation, we wish to express our sincere apologies for any distress caused.

Westlake University takes the safety and wellbeing of our students with the utmost seriousness. To that end, we would like to offer a settlement of $25,000 in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement regarding this matter. This offer is made without admission of liability and solely in the interest of resolving this situation amicably.

Please contact my office to discuss this arrangement further.

Sincerely,

Dean Richard Whitaker

Westlake University

Nick huffed a humorless laugh, drawing a curious glance from a nearby diner. The blue energy beneath his skin pulsed with sardonic amusement that mirrored his own.

*Twenty-five thousand dollars to keep quiet about being kidnapped and poisoned?* Nick thought incredulously. *The bureaucratic audacity is almost impressive.*

The timing of the email was equally telling—someone wanted to ensure this was handled before tonight's lecture. The university was clearly involved at some level, either actively or through willful ignorance.

His food arrived, and Nick ate mechanically, his mind racing through possibilities. Feldman, Williams, the surveillance, the kidnapping—all of it seemed to be converging on tonight's lecture. The blue energy flowed through his system with growing urgency, as if sensing the approaching nexus of events.

He was halfway through his burger when the bell above the diner door jingled. He didn't look up immediately—a habit he was developing to avoid appearing too alert, too aware. But his senses, heightened since cleansing the poison with mana, registered the newcomers before they even spoke: two men, one with the faint scent of campus security's standard-issue cologne, the other with the familiar aroma of chalk dust and bitter coffee that clung to most faculty.

The blue energy automatically flowed to his ears, enhancing his hearing without any conscious effort on his part. It was becoming more intuitive, more integrated with his natural responses—exactly what his mother had called the third stage of mana development.

They took a booth behind Nick—close enough that their conversation drifted to him in fragments. He kept his head down, focused on his food, while stretching his hearing the way Arlize had once used to eavesdrop on enemy camp discussions.

""…still can't believe the turnout,"" the first man said, his voice clipped and authoritative. ""Every seat reserved within an hour of the announcement.""

""Department's calling it the academic event of the year,"" replied the second—older, more hesitant. ""Though between us, I'm not sure Harrington should be showcasing this tech so publicly.""

Nick took a slow sip of water, pretending to scroll through his phone, even as he absorbed every word. The blue energy hummed with anticipation, sensing something important in the exchange.

""He's really going through with it?"" The first voice dropped lower. ""The full demonstration?""

""Apparently."" A note of resignation. ""Callahan's orders. Doesn't matter what any of us think. As long as the system doesn't trigger, and the monitoring stays within parameters…""

There was a pause, the soft clink of ice in glasses. Nick's mana stirred, unbidden—coiled tension beneath his skin. The energy flowed in agitated patterns, like water beginning to boil.

""And if it doesn't?"" the first man asked.

""That's why security's been doubled,"" the second replied. ""But honestly, I don't think anyone knows what happens if it goes wrong. That's what makes it…""

The conversation faded as a server approached, and Nick signaled for his check with practiced ease, masking the sudden tightness in his chest.

As Nick paid his bill and left, he caught a final exchange from the booth: ""Just make sure your team knows—if you see anyone showing signs, they need to be removed immediately. Quietly.""

""And Valiente?""

""Especially him.""

Nick stepped into the fading daylight, his mind racing alongside his quickened pulse. The blue energy surged through his system in response to the perceived threat, creating complex patterns beneath his skin that only he could see. They were expecting something to happen tonight. They were watching for it. For him specifically.

Taking a deep breath of crisp evening air, he steadied himself. If they were watching for him, he'd make sure he was ready.

Looking at his phone, it was 4:30 PM. Time to meet the mysterious M.E.

Murphy's Bar sat at the edge of downtown, close enough to campus to draw a student crowd on weekends but far enough to maintain a clientele of local professionals during the week. It was upscale for a college bar—dark wood furnishings, subdued lighting, and a restaurant section that served decent food alongside its extensive drink menu.

Nick arrived fifteen minutes early, pausing outside to observe the establishment through the large front windows. For a Thursday evening this early, the place was surprisingly busy—suspiciously so. Groups clustered around tables, individuals occupied strategic bar positions, and there seemed to be an unusual number of people sitting alone, ostensibly focused on phones or laptops.

*The whole place feels staged,* Nick thought, the blue energy flowing to his eyes to enhance his perception. *Like a theater set populated with extras.*

Taking a deep breath, Nick entered, immediately scanning for exits, choke points, and defensible positions—tactical assessments that now came naturally, Arlize's military experience bleeding into his own consciousness. He found an empty booth with a clear view of both the entrance and the bar, sliding in with his back to the wall.

A server approached—college-aged but not a Westlake student he recognized.

""What can I get you?"" she asked, pen poised above her notepad.

""Coke on the rocks,"" Nick replied, maintaining his surveillance of the room.

The server nodded and left. Nick continued cataloging faces, looking for anyone paying too much attention to him, anyone who might be M.E. The blue energy flowed in steady currents through his system, primed to respond to threats if necessary.

He was so focused on watching the door that he almost missed the movement in his peripheral vision. Someone slid into the seat across from him. Nick's heart rate spiked instantly, mana surging to his fingertips in preparation for defense. Then he looked up.

Older. Silver hair. Crisp suit. Electric blue eyes. Nick's mana stirred—a warning, yes, but also something else. A recognition.

Then the realization slammed into him like a freight train.

Marcus Eidolon.

""Mr. Valiente,"" the man said, his voice cultured and measured. ""I appreciate your punctuality.""

Up close, his presence was even more commanding—an air of absolute self-assurance that couldn't be faked. More striking still was his energy signature—unlike anything Nick had encountered before. Where most people emitted chaotic, unfocused electromagnetic patterns, Eidolon's was structured, deliberate, almost architectural in its precision.

""M.E.,"" Nick said, getting control of his emotions and letting his mana recede slightly but still on high alert. ""Marcus Eidolon.""

The man's lips curled into an appreciative smile. ""Indeed. Though we're not exactly strangers, Nick.""

Nick's confusion must have shown on his face because Eidolon continued, ""I am an old friend of your grandfather as well as your parents. Your father and I worked together briefly before he met your mother and shifted his focus to more... academic pursuits.""

The blue energy pulsed with sudden intensity, responding to the unexpected connection to his family. Images flashed through Nick's mind—his father's study filled with papers, quiet conversations that stopped when he entered the room, strange equipment hurriedly covered when he came home from school unexpectedly.

The server returned with Nick's Coke, asking Eidolon if he wanted anything. He ordered a sparkling water before turning his attention back to Nick.

""I should apologize for not being at their funeral,"" Eidolon said, genuine regret coloring his tone. ""International commitments kept me away, but I sent flowers. White lilies—your mother's favorite, if I recall correctly.""

Nick remembered the arrangement—it had seemed oddly elegant compared to the others, with a card signed simply ""M.E."" He hadn't connected it to anyone at the time, too overwhelmed by grief to question the sender's identity.

""You knew them well?"" Nick asked, still uncertain how to respond to this connection he hadn't anticipated. The blue energy flowed in curious patterns beneath his skin, as if trying to assess Eidolon's true nature.

""Well enough,"" Eidolon replied. ""Your father was brilliant—ahead of his time in many ways. And your mother..."" He paused, choosing his words carefully. ""She had unique insights into matters that many of us spent years struggling to understand.""

There was something in his phrasing that suggested he knew about more than just Nick's parents' academic work—something that hinted at awareness of the mana, of the Arcadian System. But before Nick could probe further, Eidolon changed direction.

""I'm curious—why haven't you contacted your grandparents in Colombia? They worry about you.""

The question caught Nick off guard. ""You talk to them often?""

""As much as I can."" Eidolon's expression softened slightly. ""Your grandfather mentioned you hadn't spoken since before starting at Westlake.""

Nick felt a pang of guilt. ""We had a disagreement about my choice of university. He wanted me to attend a university in Colombia, to be closer to family. It got... heated."" The memory of his grandfather's anger, his grandmother's tears, still stung. ""I've been meaning to reach out, but...""

""But life got complicated,"" Eidolon finished for him. ""I understand. Family relationships often are."" He leaned forward slightly. ""You should call them soon. Your grandfather is stubborn, but he loves you deeply.""

""I will,"" Nick promised, surprised by the sincerity in his own voice. ""I've been thinking about visiting during winter break.""

Eidolon's expression brightened. ""An excellent idea. Colombia is beautiful that time of year. Perhaps I could join you for part of the visit? I have business interests in Bogotá that would benefit from my presence.""

The offer seemed genuine, yet Nick couldn't shake the feeling that everything about this conversation had been carefully orchestrated. The blue energy pulsed in agreement, sensing calculated intent beneath Eidolon's warm exterior.

Before he could respond, Eidolon glanced at his watch—a sleek, minimalist device that probably cost more than a semester's tuition. The blue energy detected an unusual electromagnetic signature emanating from it—not standard electronics, but something more sophisticated.

""I'm afraid our time is limited,"" he said, his tone shifting to something more formal. ""You have Professor Harrington's lecture tonight, and I have a conference call with Tokyo in thirty minutes.""

As he spoke, Eidolon reached across the table, briefly covering Nick's hand with his own. When he withdrew, a small device remained—circular, about the size of an aspirin, metallic with faint green circuitry visible beneath a translucent surface.

""Your friend's tech will help,"" Eidolon said quietly, nodding toward Nick's pocket where Maggie's glasses rested. ""This will do more. Use it at the lecture tonight.""

Nick stared at the device, questions multiplying in his mind. The blue energy reacted strangely to its presence—not with alarm, but with something closer to curiosity. ""What is it?""

""Protection,"" Eidolon replied cryptically. ""And perhaps a bit more."" He stood, adjusting his cuffs with practiced precision. ""Come by our downtown offices this weekend. I'll text you the address.""

He placed a business card beside Nick's untouched drink—simple white card stock with nothing but ""EIDOLON"" embossed in silver lettering.

""Good luck tonight,"" Eidolon said, his intense blue eyes meeting Nick's one final time. ""Your parents would be proud of the man you're becoming.""

With that, he turned and walked away, weaving through the crowded bar with the confidence of someone who expected others to move aside—which, remarkably, they did.

Outside Murphy's, Nick stood on the sidewalk, the small device cradled in his palm. The encounter with Eidolon had left him with more questions than answers. The man clearly knew things about Nick's family, about the situation at Westlake, perhaps even about Nick's abilities—yet Nick was left with more questions than answers from the interaction.

Nick's first instinct was to call Maggie, to have her examine the device before he did anything reckless. But a glance at his phone made his stomach drop—6:30 PM.

*Wait. An hour and a half has passed?* Nick thought with alarm. *That can't be right. The meeting started just after 5. I wasn't in the bar that long.*

The memory of his time in the bar was crisp—every word, every gesture, still sharp in his mind. No gaps. No fatigue.

But time had vanished like smoke.

*Did Marcus do something to me?* Nick wondered, the blue energy pulsing with sudden unease. *Did he use mana too?*

The idea shouldn't have surprised him—but it did. The way time had slipped, the way his energy hadn't rebelled against the man's presence...

Nick exhaled slowly, forcing his mind to stop chasing threads he didn't have the time—or tools—to unravel. Too many questions. Too many secrets. He'd ask Marcus about the time loss next time they met.

He looked at the sky, the sun almost below the horizon, its last rays mingling with the indigo and violet of the incoming night sky. Harrington's lecture started at 7:00, and he still needed to get back to campus, change, and prepare.

Nick turned the device over in his palm. It looked harmless—smooth, metallic, no buttons or markings. But something about it buzzed against his skin. Not electronically. Energetically. His mana prickled against it like static meeting steel.

He thought about calling Maggie. He thought about throwing it in a storm drain. But something tugged at him—subtle, quiet, insistent. Acting on instinct, he funneled a thin thread of mana into his vision, enhancing his perception beyond normal human limits.

What he saw made him nearly drop the device in shock. Blue static energy seemed to dance around it—similar to what he'd observed with technology affected by his mana—but there was something else. Thin threads of green energy, distinct from his blue mana, moved with purpose across the surface, forming distinct patterns that shifted and reformed.

As Nick focused, the green energy coalesced into words:

*Eat Me*

""What the hell?"" Nick muttered, drawing a curious glance from a passing pedestrian.

Arlize's memories surged forward, warnings of magical traps and poisoned offerings from ancient adversaries. Nick's modern sensibilities were equally alarmed—consuming unknown technology seemed categorically unwise.

As his thoughts spiraled through worst-case scenarios, the green energy shifted again, reforming into new words:

*Won't hurt you. Only help. Promise.*

Nick's eyes widened. The device was responding to his thoughts, or at least to his doubts. The implications were staggering—neural interface technology that could read surface thoughts and respond in real-time.

More shocking still, Nick felt his own mana pulse in response to the green energy—not in rejection or defense, but in recognition. Something in him resonated with whatever powered this device, as if they shared some fundamental frequency. The blue energy flowed toward the device in curious patterns, as if testing its compatibility.

Against every rational argument his mind could muster, Nick felt a certainty forming in his gut. A rightness that transcended logical analysis. Before he could second-guess himself further, he placed the device on his tongue and swallowed.

For several seconds, nothing happened. Then, a strange warmth spread from his center outward, racing along pathways that perfectly matched his mana circulation. The sensation wasn't unpleasant—more like the feeling of stepping into a hot shower after being caught in cold rain.

Nick blinked, and for a moment, the world seemed to shift into enhanced focus. Colors intensified, sounds separated into distinct layers, and the electromagnetic signatures of nearby devices became visible as faint auras around phones and cars. The blue energy within him surged in response to the device, flowing with renewed vigor through pathways that seemed newly optimized.

Just as quickly, the sensations normalized, leaving behind only a lingering clarity—as if some background static in his perception had been eliminated.

Nick checked his watch—Maggie's EM detector showed no abnormal readings. Whatever had just happened, it hadn't triggered her safeguards.

He started walking back toward campus, his pace quickening as the minutes ticked by. With each step, the certainty grew stronger—whatever he had just consumed wasn't merely technology.

It was a key.

As soon as he stepped into his dorm room and the door clicked shut behind him, a low buzzing began to build in his ears. It wasn't mechanical—but internal, like mana vibrating along his nerves. The blue energy responded with unprecedented intensity, flowing through his system in complex patterns that resembled circuit diagrams.

Before he could react, the world tilted sideways. His vision tunneled. Darkness swallowed him whole.

*It couldn't have been more than five minutes.*

Nick gasped awake, body rigid, breath caught in his throat. A pale glow filled the space in front of his eyes—not external light, but information projected directly onto his visual cortex. Lines of glyphs and light unfurled across his vision like living calligraphy, patterns more complex and beautiful than anything he'd ever seen.

1le7zwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1le7zwg/rebirth_protocol_bk1_ch_12_opening_salvo/,Rebirth Protocol - Bk1 Ch. 12 - Opening Salvo,"The calculus classroom was unnaturally quiet as Nick slipped into his usual seat. Students hunched over their notes, frantically reviewing formulas before Professor Ellis' promised quiz. The air hung heavy with pencil shavings and nervous sweat, the harsh fluorescent lights casting a sickly pallor over everyone.

Nick scanned the room, immediately noticing Jordan's empty seat beside him. The absence spoke volumes—Jordan hadn't missed a single class since the semester began, except for the day after the Alpha Phi party when he'd shown up with bruised knuckles.

*First he misses the quiz, then reappears with damaged knuckles, now absent again during another quiz,* Nick thought. *Either he's the world's most inconsistent handler, or someone's rotating surveillance duties.*

Nick arranged his materials with methodical precision, positioning his tablet to avoid reflections while maintaining awareness of his surroundings. The military-postured student from Statistics class sat three rows back, pretending to study while his eyes tracked Nick's movements with practiced subtlety. With his enhanced perception, Nick detected the faint electromagnetic signature of a communications device in the man's ear—the subtle hum of encrypted transmissions completely imperceptible to normal human senses.

Professor Ellis strode in at exactly 2:00 PM, the classroom falling silent as he placed the quiz papers on the front desk. Instead of his usual casual demeanor, Ellis moved with a controlled precision that reminded Nick of military officers preparing troops for inspection.

""As promised, we begin with a quiz on integration techniques,"" he announced, distributing papers with brisk efficiency. ""You have forty-five minutes. Show all work for partial credit.""

Nick scanned the first problem, pen poised—then froze. The blue energy beneath his skin pulsed once in warning, like radar detecting an approaching threat.

The problem appeared ordinary at first glance. But the framing, the variables, even the terrain figures—they matched the military supply-chain simulations Arlize used during the western sieges. Too precisely to be coincidence.

The second problem featured topographical integration across curved surfaces—virtually identical to the mana-flow calculations Arlize had developed for amplifying energy through crystalline conductors. The third problem involved probability distributions that mirrored battle casualty projections from the Aurilian War.

Nick glanced up at Ellis, who had positioned himself behind the rows of seats, hands clasped behind his back. He wasn't monitoring the class. He was watching Nick specifically, his gaze intense and evaluating.

Their eyes locked and held for a moment, the stare in Ellis' eyes raising goosebumps on the back of Nick's neck before he looked down at his quiz again.

*This isn't a calculus quiz,* Nick realized, the mana beneath his skin humming in response to his heightened alertness. *It's a test designed specifically for me—to see if I recognize patterns from Arlize's world.*

He worked quickly, answering each problem with subtle correctness, adjusting his methods just slightly—enough to mask his precision. By the end, he felt confident the answers would check out, but no automated system would flag them as anomalous.

*Show competence without revealing mastery,* Nick reminded himself, Arlize's tactical mind integrating seamlessly with his own. *Let them see talent, not transcendence.*

""Ten minutes remaining,"" Ellis called.

Nick had already finished, but he remained still, using the time to recalibrate his assessment of the situation. Jordan was gone. The watcher was present. And now Ellis was behaving more like a handler than a professor. The blue energy beneath his skin pulsed in slow, controlled rhythms as Nick maintained his composure, mapping out scenarios and possible responses.

When time was called, Nick stood and approached the front to turn in his quiz. Ellis accepted it with a nod, his eyes unreadable behind wire-rimmed glasses.

""Good work on last week's practice set,"" Ellis said, voice quieter now. ""Your solutions were... efficient.""

Nick hesitated just a beat. ""I've been practicing those a lot. Used to get tripped up on them in high school.""

""Indeed."" Ellis' gaze sharpened, almost imperceptibly. ""Putting in the work tends to pay off. Especially when the stakes are higher than anyone realizes.""

Nick nodded slowly. ""Understood.""

Then Ellis leaned forward slightly and, in a tone meant for Nick alone, said:

""Don't eat anything you didn't watch being served. At least not for the rest of this week.""

Nick blinked, keeping his expression neutral as the mana within him surged in response to the unexpected warning. He nodded again, a shade deeper, and turned to leave.

""Thank you, sir,"" he responded, his tone carefully neutral.

As he walked out, he didn't look back. But the interaction replayed in his mind—Ellis' choice of words, the timing, the warning. Each element felt deliberate, another piece of a puzzle Nick was only beginning to guess at.

Why was Ellis trying to help him? Was this another test? Were they trying to gauge his response to such an obvious warning?

The military-postured student left shortly after Nick, maintaining a careful distance—subtle enough to fool casual observers but immediately apparent to Nick's enhanced awareness. The man's electromagnetic signature pulsed with controlled purpose—no longer passive observation, but active tracking.

Pushing the strange interaction with Ellis aside, Nick headed to the Undergraduate Library to work. The blue energy beneath his skin had settled into a vigilant hum, ready for threats but not actively manifesting.

The library's fifth floor stood nearly deserted, late afternoon sun casting long shadows through tall windows. The air smelled of paper and dust, with underlying notes of coffee from a student who'd passed through earlier. Nick claimed a study carrel in the farthest corner, positioning himself with clear sightlines to both stairwells while remaining partially concealed by bookshelves.

For the next hour, he methodically completed assignments—detailed notes on cellular adaptation for Biology, preparing for his upcoming group project with Hannah. After finishing Bio, he refined his Computer Science code and completed analytical response papers for Intro to Business.

With each assignment, his mind worked with unprecedented clarity—forming connections between disciplines that most students would never see. The cellular adaptation principles informed his understanding of code resilience, while both enhanced his business analysis. This wasn't just Arlize's knowledge merging with his own—it was a fundamental evolution in how his brain processed information.

After completing his assignments, Nick opened his tablet and began the real work, connecting to a diagnostic script Maggie had built, adapted from her brother's research on low-frequency quantum interference. The concept was simple: small pulses that pinged the amygdala to reveal anyone with latent mana fields.

The script's code structure eerily resembled the mana detection systems Arlize had encountered during the Aurilian Wars—different technology but identical principles. Both searched for energy signatures operating beyond normal physical parameters.

Nick's purpose in the library wasn't just to study. It was to learn how to lie to the algorithm. If he could deceive this detection system, he'd be one step closer to overcoming whatever Professor Harrington planned for tomorrow's lecture.

He pulled up a shell overlay Arlize had once used to confuse enemy mana trackers—then adapted it to modern parameters. Weaker pulse. Localized. Personalized to his signature. The blue energy within him responded to his intentions, flowing into his fingertips as he typed, creating a seamless connection between his consciousness and the digital code.

His fingers danced across the screen, crafting a masking layer that would distort his natural aura just enough to blend into background noise. Harmless. Ordinary. Uninteresting. The mana enhanced his coding abilities, letting him see patterns and possibilities that normal perception couldn't detect.

By the time the library lights dimmed into evening mode, he had something—not perfect, but usable. The code pulsed on his screen with a rhythm matching the blue energy flowing beneath his skin, as if the two systems had synchronized on some fundamental level.

It wouldn't hide him from an all-out scan, but it might be enough to misdirect suspicion tomorrow.

He backed up the prototype code to the drive Maggie gave him and closed his tablet. Nick checked the time—6:30 PM. The cafeteria would still serve dinner for another hour. His enhanced metabolism demanded fuel, especially before the intense mana practice session he planned for later that evening.

As he gathered his materials, he methodically swept the area for surveillance before leaving the library. He headed back to his dorm, dropped off his backpack, changed into workout clothes, then made his way to the cafeteria.

Walking across the quad, Nick turned his thoughts to tomorrow's neural interface lecture with Professor Harrington. The event loomed in his mind like a fortress he was preparing to infiltrate—unknown dangers hiding behind seemingly academic walls.

*What would he find there? A trap, certainly—but what kind? Would they attempt to trigger his abilities with targeted stimuli designed to provoke a mana response? Or was it more insidious—a screening mechanism to identify potential subjects for their research?*

Nick considered his options with Arlize's tactical precision. Direct confrontation was out of the question—he lacked sufficient intelligence about their capabilities and objectives. A purely defensive approach seemed equally flawed; passivity would reveal nothing new.

*Strike a balance,* Arlize's memories counseled. *Present strength enough to earn respect but vulnerability enough to invite underestimation.*

In battle, Arlize had often employed a strategy of controlled revelation—showing just enough skill to unsettle opponents while concealing his true capabilities. The same approach might work here. Let Harrington glimpse elements of his abilities—enough to confirm their interest while misdirecting about the true nature and extent of his powers.

By the time Nick reached the cafeteria, he'd formulated a preliminary strategy: observe, record, and present a carefully curated version of himself—the gifted student with unexplained potential rather than the reborn warrior-mage with growing control of mana. Let them chase shadows while he gathered intelligence.

The cafeteria buzzed with typical evening activity—students clustered around tables, the clatter of trays and silverware creating a cacophony that masked potential surveillance. The air carried industrial cooking smells—today's special was some pasta dish, its tomato-based sauce adding a tangy note to the standard cafeteria blend of overcooked vegetables and warming trays.

Nick moved through the food line with practiced efficiency, selecting his usual protein-heavy meal: grilled chicken, steamed vegetables, brown rice. Nothing that would draw attention or disrupt his established pattern. He watched carefully as the server plated his food directly from the serving trays, Ellis's warning echoing in his mind.

He claimed a corner table with good sightlines to all entrances, positioning himself with his back to the wall. As he ate, Nick mentally reviewed tomorrow's crucial tasks: collecting apartment keys, establishing his secure base, and attending Harrington's lecture with Maggie's surveillance equipment in place.

Three bites into his meal, something felt wrong.

Nick paused, fork hovering halfway to his mouth. The chicken tasted normal, the seasoning perhaps a bit heavier than usual, but nothing overtly suspicious. Yet something in his system was reacting, a subtle warning growing more insistent with each bite.

The mana.

Beneath his skin, a faint blue pulse flickered along his veins—visible only to him, a warning system more accurate than any technological sensor. As he took another experimental bite, the blue energy flickered more aggressively, creating a sensation like static electricity beneath his skin.

Nick set down his fork, suddenly alert. This wasn't his first experience with this reaction. A memory surfaced—fragmentary but distinct—from senior year of high school. The blue energy within him responded to the memory, enhancing its clarity, bringing forgotten details rushing back with vivid intensity.

""Come on, Valiente, loosen up for once."" Matt's voice carried over the pounding bass that filled his parents' basement. The Harrington's home theater system probably cost more than Nick's entire house, but Matt treated it like a disposable toy, cranking the volume until the walls vibrated.

Nick perched uncomfortably on the edge of a leather couch worth more than his mom's car, surrounded by Westridge's elite—the sons and daughters of doctors, lawyers, executives. Matt's inner circle had never welcomed him before tonight.

""I'm good,"" Nick replied, gesturing to the half-empty beer in his hand. He'd been nursing the same drink all night, uneasy with how the others downed shots like water. He needed to stay alert; this invitation had come too suddenly, too unexpectedly to trust.

""That's not good enough,"" Matt insisted, his smile tight and calculated as he appeared with two shot glasses filled with amber liquid. ""Senior project presentation tomorrow. We drink to success.""

Nick hesitated. Matt had never shown interest in his academic performance before—why start now? But the others were watching, and Nick felt the familiar pressure to belong, to be accepted by this group that had ignored him for years.

""Fine, one shot,"" he conceded, accepting the glass.

Matt raised his own. ""To new partnerships,"" he said, something knowing in his eyes that made Nick's skin crawl.

The liquor burned going down, but the burning didn't stop at his throat. It spread outward, a strange tingling sensation radiating through his chest and limbs. Within minutes, the room began to spin, darkness creeping at the edges of his vision.

Through blurring sight, Nick saw Matt watching him with clinical interest rather than concern, phone in hand as if documenting the reaction. Something blue flickered at the edges of Nick's awareness—a faint glow that seemed to pulse beneath his skin, visible only to him.

""What... what was in that?"" Nick managed to ask, his words slurring uncontrollably.

""Just a little something to help us understand you better,"" Matt replied, his voice suddenly distant yet distinctly frustrated. He checked his watch, then looked back at Nick with narrowed eyes. ""Shouldn't something be happening right now? I did everything according to your father's research...""

Leaning closer, Matt scrutinized Nick's face, disappointment evident in his expression. Pulling out his phone, he muttered, ""Subject showing resistance to compound V7, minimal manifestation."" The clinical detachment in his voice chilled Nick more than any anger could have.

Nick tried to stand, to escape, but his legs buckled beneath him. As consciousness faded, the last thing he saw was Matt's scowling face looming above him as he lay helpless on the ground.

The next morning, Nick awakened in his own bed with no memory of how he'd gotten home and a splitting headache that lasted for days. When he confronted Matt, the other boy laughed it off, spinning a story about Nick embarrassing himself after too many drinks.

Nick's hands trembled as he returned to the present. Rage flared, fast and uninvited. The blue energy beneath his skin pulsed in response, creating jagged patterns that mirrored his anger. They'd tested him once—without his knowledge, without his consent—and now they were doing it again.

His food had been tampered with.

But how? He'd watched the cafeteria worker plate it directly from serving trays. Unless...

Nick scanned the room carefully, spotting an unfamiliar cafeteria employee watching him from the beverage station. Their eyes met briefly before the worker turned away too quickly, retreating through the staff door.

*Whoever did this just crossed the line.*

Nick casually pushed his tray away and stood, gathering his belongings with deliberate calm despite the agitated mana now visibly pulsing beneath his skin—a blue lightning storm only he could see. His enhanced metabolism was already working to neutralize whatever they'd laced into his food, the mana accelerating the process.

Since they'd drugged his meal, they would be waiting for the effects to take hold. Nick dumped his tray in the disposal area and exited the cafeteria, maintaining an unhurried pace while keeping his senses on high alert. The campus fitness center would be crowded at this hour—perfect for avoiding anything overt. Too many witnesses.

The cool evening air hit his face as he stepped outside, a welcome relief from the cafeteria's stuffy atmosphere. The quadrangle stretched before him, dimly lit by lampposts casting pools of yellow light at regular intervals. Most students had already finished dinner, leaving the paths relatively empty.

The air shifted—too quiet, too focused. Mana crackled low in his veins, responding to danger before his conscious mind could process it.

*Something's coming.*

He hadn't gone fifty yards when his enhanced senses detected movement behind him—footsteps accelerating, breathing patterns shifting from casual to purposeful. Someone was closing the distance rapidly.

Nick spun around, mana surging in preparation—but too late.

Two metallic prongs struck his chest. A blinding flash of electricity overwhelmed his nervous system. The current disrupted his control over the mana, sending it into chaotic patterns that flared wild and untamed beneath his skin. Every muscle contracted simultaneously as voltage coursed through him, disrupting his mana flow and slamming him to the ground.

Through blurring vision, he glimpsed a hooded figure standing over him, speaking urgently into what looked like a communications device. The world tilted and spun, colors bleeding together as the drug already in his system combined with the electrical shock.

""Package secured. Moving now.""

Nick tried to focus, to draw on the mana to counteract the effects, but the electricity had created a temporary disruption in his neural pathways. The blue energy sparked and flailed without direction.

As darkness closed in around the edges of his vision, Nick caught a glimpse of a silver ring on the attacker's hand—a serpent swallowing its tail.

I'm really hoping someone out there can give me some advice on what to do here.. even if it's the brutally honest kind.

I (22F) have been living in my parents' home for as long as I remember; it's always been me, my mom (54F) my dad (54M), my younger brothers and two dogs. I also have older siblings, but they're not so relevant to this story. The last 4 years of living with them have become NEAR UNBEARABLE! It's as if, no matter what I say, wear, or choose, my dad HAS TO make it clear he's disappointed in me.

I wear dark clothes bc I'm alt when I go out with friends or running errands? ""Y'know you can't wear this shit at work, right?""

I wanna be a graphic novel author and artist? ""Most artists don't become famous until they die. Try going into robotics.""

I accidently raise my voice a little or have an attitude? ""I'd drop the fuckin attitude, dude!""

I apologize for said attitude and tell him I'm trying my best to work on this with my therapist? ""No you're not. If you were, you'd stop doing it."" (I'm autistic, btw; tonal disregulation)

It's resulted in QUITE A FEW arguments over the years, and I genuinely started to wonder if my own father was actually toxic. It's like it doesn't even TRY to understand me, my feelings, or where the feelings are coming from! It stresses me out whenever he's here, like I'm just waiting for the fight to come. My mom's noticed it a lot, and she romanticizes about me and him hashing out our feelings and reconciling, but I just don't see it happening. We used to be so close, but.. I just don't see the version of him I knew anymore.

Fast forward to yesterday. I find out through a call with my mom that I lost a BIG opportunity to work at the school she works at with disabled children, because I got super stressed about the paperwork and called HR in my panicked frustration. I know it was my fault, and of course, I was upset with myself. I go upstairs to try and eat, and I see my dad come in from working on the Bobcat outside. Turns out, mom already called him and told him what happened, and he was also upset with me. I tried to tell him I was already upset enough, and I didn't need a second reeming out, but of course; he went on anyway. In a flood of emotions, I started to cry and say everything that he had made me feel; how I felt like the screw-up kid, how I feel like he doesn't approve of or support me, and how he doesn't even TRY to understand me! He said ""Fuck you"" to me, yelled in my ear, and then mocked me while I was in tears, so I threw out the rest of my breakfast and just went back to my room.

When my mom got home, she sat me down in the living room and told me and my dad we had to hash it all out, and.. needless to say, shit got LOUD. HE DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG ON HIS END. So I was open and honest about everything, in a calmer manner this time, and told him again about how he makes me feel; how I need him to sympathize with me and understand where my frustration is coming from. And he proceeded to tell me that he DID support me and that me thinking he didn't was all in my own head; that it was all a problem with my self-esteem. Granted, my mom said it wasn't just me and had already talked to him about the mocking, but she quickly started to agree with him. It lasted for an hour, and afterward, I just didn't know what to say or do anymore. My mom suggested then that, now that everything's out there, I should forgive them, and we should all try to start over. But, frankly, I don't think I CAN let go of everything. Once you crumple paper, you can't just uncrumple it and expect it to be like new; all the dents are STILL THERE. I ended up saying something about how I still don't feel supported, and MY MOM LOST IT! She pushed the coffee table, knocking things all over the floor and dad came back in to see what was happening, as mom started SCREAMING at me for wasting time because I ""didn't even listen to them.""

""We've been sitting with you for AN HOUR about this! WE SUPPORT YOU! If we didn't, you wouldn't be living in this house, would you!?""We told you we're behind you, and you answer us with how you want to LEAVE?""

I was SOBBING at this point and was scared by all the yelling! I was hyperventilating as I tried to leave, but dad blocked the way to my room, and mom yelled at me to sit back down! I had to sit there and take her screaming at me until she finally agreed to let me go, so I locked the spare bedroom door and cried my eyes out in there.


Now I'm back in my own room, typing this out. I don't really know what to do or say now, but one of my friends on Discord said I should post my story here and hear your advice. So, Reddit, what's my verdict? AITJ?

EDIT: wanted to quickly clarify that I do have a college education, graduated with am Associates Degree just a month ago. I take care of the dishes as well as cleaning up after dinner, and my brothers don't really need my help (they're 16 and 14).

Admiral Kishimoto walked into the Black Hole, the last of the high-ranking officers to attend this meeting. He looked around at the others as he slowly walked to his seat and took a seat in his designated chair.

""Nice of you to finally join us,"" General Marcus said as he looked around. ""Now, can we get this thing started?"" He asked, annoyed at the delay.

""Yes, we can,"" Admiral Williams said as she turned on the 3D projector in the middle of the table.

""First, I got to know, did his gracious jackass try to blackmail you?"" Kishimoto asked, suspecting the answer.

""Yes, but we have enough dirt on him to end his political career and bury him in legal trouble,"" she said as she adjusted the view on the projector.

""What are we looking at here Williams?"" Khabishove asked, staring at the POV someone's helmet caught.

""This is the POV Henry001's helmet caught on his first mission. Now, any other questions?"" Williams snapped at the General.

""No,"" He said as he fortified his stare at her.

""Great, now let's get this started. We have some stuff to get through,"" Williams said as she started the footage. The four leaders watched the footage, showing looks of horror at the detachment and carnage that Henry deployed, except for Williams, who wore a grin. They watched as Henry swept through the battlefield, killing anyone he crossed. Williams paused the footage on a UHC tank.

""Now this is something that I already took care of. A certain doctor received a visit from Aave040. I will show you the footage of that in just a second,"" Williams said as she continued the footage from Henry's mission on Tak-Val. They watched as Henry continued his slaughter, both amazed and concerned at the same time. The ultimate test came when he was presented with the options to blow the reactors or not. He chose to kill everyone on that planet, innocent or not.

""What have we done?"" Marcus said as he put his face in his palms and then let them slide down.

""We have created the perfect weapon, one not burdened by morals, and emotionally bankrupt. This is the pinnacle of the Vanguard program,"" Williams said, smiling ear to ear. She was more than happy with the success of Henry.

""Yes, but at what cost you stupid bitch!"" Marcus said, throwing his chair at the wall.

""Don't act all high and mighty now, you arrogant bastard. You had your chance to say no, but you didn't,"" Williams yelled back as Kishimoto and Khabishove watched.

""Well I am putting an end to this right now! I am going to the press to tell them the truth,"" Marcus said, walking to the door, but a new voice stopped everyone.

""Now now, let's not get too hasty. How about you take a seat?"" Albert said, taking his form on the 3D projector.

""How in the fuck did you get here?"" Williams said in shock.

""Oh Admiral, it was easy, you brought me in here,"" Albert said, his avatar smiling at her. ""Now let us get down to business. I have a few demands,"" Albert started before Khabishove cut him off.

""I am not going to let some computer make demands,"" Khabishove said before Albert continued.

""If you do not comply with my demands, I have thousands of fragments all over the place, I will wage war on the four of you, and the entirety of the UHC government,"" Albert said as he pointed his pipe at Khabishove.

""You don't have the ability to create fragments or clones,"" Williams said, trying to call what she perceived as a bluff.

""Williams, on the night that you decided to give Lin the Vanguard program, you went on a date with him, and went back to your office where the two of you did the nasty. Right now, I am a fragment. I sent myself in the transmission of the last mission report, and Kishimoto is late because he was flirting with the barista at the base's coffee shop,"" Albert said, looking around at the others. ""Need I continue?"" He asked.

""No, we get your point. What are the demands?"" Williams asked, losing her smile.

""First, I want Valasquez stationed with Henry. It would do that boy well. Second is I want you to make sure that you don't have any more bad intel. What happened on Tak-Val is unacceptable. Had that been the Liam, Sofia, and Imani, one or all of them could have died. The third is I want the crew of the New Hope and Henry put on one of the Furtim missile carriers. I know we need him to do dangerous things, but I want him to have the best shot possible."" Albert said and looked directly at Williams. She nodded her head, knowing the AI had escaped their control.

""Our only means of controlling him now is Henry,"" She thought to herself.

""Tomorrow, the ship will be in dock, and I'll send out the orders to the Captain. Don't make me regret this,"" Williams said, looking dead into Albert's blue light figure.

""One more thing, Admiral, don't try sending Aave after Henry, he is too strong for her, and any Vanguard would sooner kill you than another Vanguard. With that, Albert faded out, and the footage switched over to the fight Henry had with the devourer, leaving the leaders even more baffled.

""Why do you think that he switched the footage?"" Marcus asked.

""Why else you dipshit, it's a warning,"" Kishimoto quipped back.

""He left some notes, Mission to retrieve AI complete, no further issues,"" Khabishove said as he looked at the projector.

""I say that we just give the blasted thing what it wants. We can't afford to wage a war on a rogue AI right now. Shipyards are being built faster than anticipated, and we are putting out hundreds of ships a day. The reports earlier said that we are now up to ten titan-class ships, and one hundred destroyers, almost a thousand battle ships, and tens of thousands of smaller ships,"" Williams said as she brought the conversation back on track.

""Can you play that footage of the traitor. If it wasn't for him and his threats, we would never have had to go public about the Operation Vanguard."" Marcus said as he crossed his arms and leaned back.

Williams silently swiped the projector to switch the footage over to Aave's helmet. They watched as the camera started to record when she walked into Sanchez's home, found her way to his room, and sat in the chair that he had in the corner. Williams fast-forwarded the footage to the moment that Sanchez entered his home. The wrinkled, brown-skinned man's face dropped the moment he spotted Aave.

""I guess the jig is up, but before you kill me, wouldn't you like to see your family? I think I have a photo of them on my computer?"" Sanchez asked. Before he could even fathom what happened, Aave closed the distance between the two of them and put a plasma blade through his stomach.

""I don't need to see some fabricated photos. The other Vanguards are my family."" Aave said as she kneeled over the disgraced doctor, who looked up at her blue visor, terror in his eyes. ""It's your lucky day, I have orders to take you back to Earth, alive. If it wasn't for that, I would have killed you. However, they didn't say I couldn't ruff you up a bit,"" She said as she grabbed up the aged man and started to carry him to the shuttle just one block away. As she got closer to the shuttle, its active camo started to dissipate, revealing a completely black shuttle. She opened the sliding door and through the old man in roughly before she climbed in. She closed the door and cuffed the old man to the floor. After she secured Sanchez, she got into the cockpit and took off.
