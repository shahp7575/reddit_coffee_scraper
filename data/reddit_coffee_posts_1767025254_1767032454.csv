1pytq8l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pytq8l,"Balancing luxury staples with daily drivers. My recent pickups: Miu Miu, Asics, Canada Goose & more.","1. Miu Miu Arcadie Leather Bag (Brown)
The Vibe: Current ""It Girl"" aesthetic. Very trendy but classic silhouette. Review: Honestly, the leather grain here looks surprisingly buttery. The embossing on the ""MIU MIU"" logo has good depth—it’s not too shallow, which is a common flaw on these. The hardware gold tone looks subtle rather than that cheap, overly yellow gold. The structure seems to hold up well even when empty.

Pros: The packaging (box/dust bag) looks pristine. The color is a perfect neutral for fall/winter fits.

Cons: These bags are prone to scratching because the leather is soft. You have to baby it.

Rating: 9/10 – A heavy hitter. Looks expensive.

2. 6PM (Six PM) Black Hoodie
The Vibe: DACH region streetwear, oversized, heavy-weight comfort. Review: Standard 6PM aesthetic. The embroidery on the hood and chest looks tight—no connecting stitch flaws or loose threads visible from this distance. The contrast stitching is a nice touch, giving it that deconstructed look. The hood shape looks substantial (stiff enough to stand up), which is crucial for a hoodie at this price point.

Pros: Thick blank, likely high GSM. The embroidery detailing elevates it above a basic black hoodie.

Cons: 6PM sizing can be weird (often very boxy/cropped). If you didn't size correctly, it might sit too short on the waist.

Rating: 7.5/10 – Solid daily driver, but fit is everything here.

3. Grey Graphic Zip-Up (Unknown Brand/Y2K Style)
The Vibe: Y2K revival, opium-adjacent, slouchy fit. Review: Looks like a soft cotton blend. The 3D puff print/embroidery across the chest is bold. The grey tone is versatile. However, the zipper hardware is the make-or-break factor here; if it waves or bubbles when you sit down, it ruins the silhouette. The cuffs look a bit loose/relaxed, which fits the style but might stretch out over time.

Pros: Very comfortable looking. The embroidery design is clean and centered.

Cons: The zipper track looks a little flimsy. Light grey stains easily.

Rating: 6.5/10 – Cool piece for lounging or layering, but durability is a question mark.

4. Canada Goose Freestyle Vest (White)
The Vibe: Winter luxury, functional, ""clean girl/guy"" aesthetic. Review: This is a bold choice. White Canada Goose gear is notoriously hard to keep clean, but it looks the best when it is clean. The badge looks solid—the leaves look distinct and the font spacing is decent (common tell on bad ones). The puffiness (down fill) looks adequate, though it could be a bit loftier in the collar area.

Pros: The badge placement is correct. It’s an insane flex piece for layering over hoodies.

Cons: Immediate anxiety about getting it dirty. The collar looks slightly deflated in the photo (might just need to be fluffed in the dryer).

Rating: 8/10 – Looks fire, just don't spill coffee on it.

5. Asics Gel-Kayano 14 (Silver/Blue)
The Vibe: Tech-runner, dad-shoe, JJJJound aesthetic (without the markup). Review: These are arguably the best sneaker silhouette of the last year. The mesh quality looks breathable and the metallic overlays are cutting cleanly (no jagged edges). The glue work around the midsole looks clean, which is rare even for retail pairs lately. The colorway is extremely wearable.

Pros: Insane comfort (Gel tech). Matches literally everything (jeans, sweats, cargos).

Cons: The mesh toebox is fragile; watch out for toe poking through after heavy wear.

Rating: 9.5/10 – Near perfect sneaker. Essential rotation piece.

6. Burberry Classic Check Scarf
The Vibe: Old money, heritage luxury, safe gift. Review: You can't go wrong with the classic check. The tassels/fringing look neat and unfrayed. The crucial thing with these is the alignment of the pattern—the black and red lines seem to intersect symmetrically, which is good. The packaging is nice, but the scarf itself is what matters. If this is cashmere, it's a win; if it's wool, it might be itchy.

Pros: Timeless. Never goes out of style. Keeps value well.

Cons: Everyone has one (or a dupe of one). It’s a bit ""safe"" compared to the rest of the haul.

I'm currently obsessed with anything and everything related to the Rolling Thunder Revue. I feel like the sound is so full, and I especially LOVE the violin on tracks like Isis and One More Cup of Coffee (a few of my favs!). I had never heard of anything about this era in Dylan's career, until I watched the Martin Scorsese film. Since then, I've scoured every corner of the internet to find any footage from that period. 

I was born in 1976, and my family raised me on country music, so anything I know about Dylan, I've had to find on my own. I'd love to hear what people, who have been around for the whole trip, think about this era in Dylan's music. What were the perceptions of the songs/music? The tour? The face makeup? All the hangers-on? How does it compare to the other periods in Dylan's career? Don't hold back!",1,1767032225.0,bobdylan,0,1.0,False

I’m a mid-20s NYC transplant, recently liberated from a shoebox apartment in Bushwick with 7 other roommates. I make a very healthy six-figure salary as a digital nomad in tech/finance/creative-whatever. Basically, I’ve mastered the art of working just enough to afford avocado toast and a small private island someday.

I’m currently scouting neighborhoods and am intrigued by Fishtown. I hear it’s basically Williamsburg’s slightly cheaper, more “authentic” cousin, with a Sweetgreen and artisanal coffee shops to get my vegan gluten free dairy free soy skinny vanilla latte with a foamy finish. 

Other must-haves: craft cocktail bars within walking distance with $25 old fashioned, a dog-friendly café for my Golden Doodle service dog to sit at the bar (he’s very discerning), at least one boutique yoga studio that also sells kombucha, and enough artisanal pizza spots that I can justify skipping lunch entirely.

Is Fishtown really the Philly Williamsburg, or am I better off settling in another neighborhood where my aura of ironic sophistication will be properly appreciated? And is $3,000/mo a reasonable enough budget? I feel that might be cutting it too close.

Applications are closed and we have officially locked in our new mod team! We want to introduce ourselves so you can get to know who’s working behind the scenes to help make this sub a happier and healthier place to be in. We’re not perfect, but we’re trying!



Say hello to your moderating team:



u/Timevian has been a moderator since 2021 working to build up the sub through the release of ACOSF. They’re known as the Priestess of Church Azris, and they are big fans of Azris and Mirthroot. They picked up acotar in 2015 and fell in love. Who can say no to hot faeries!? They enjoy memes and joking around with other users. Gaming is a big pastime for them too! Atop that, they love making friends with other readers and devouring different series like the book gremlin they are. *Beware of Chicken* is one of their favourite series right now alongside ACOTAR. You will often find them deep in their hermit cave with a couple candles burning low and piles of books surrounding them. If they hiss, just offer them another book and maybe a snack. They might let you join them to read! 

Also, please don’t hold all their typo against thems. The typo fairy came to visit one day and fell in love with Timey. Despite their best efforts, this faerie continues to plagu– er, visit frequently.. Good luck. 



u/SageThistle has also been with the team for a while now, lover of Helion and Azris. She loves video games aside from reading, particularly cozy games like Fields of Mistria and Hello Kitty Island Adventure. She has also been on a Stephen King kick since last year, slowly making her way through his published works.



You might be familiar with u/Paraplueschi from all the beautiful (and hilarious) fanart they share within our community. From the Archeron sisters to your favourite High Lords, they’ve covered them all - but especially Tamlin! They have been in the fandom for several years now and do their best to keep showing up to support fellow artists and creators!



Among our newest team members are u/highlordofkrypton who’s best known for memes, crackshipping dreams and today’s miscellaneous ACOTAR question of the day as well as being Beron Vanserra’s head of PR (nobody said she was good at it, #tamberlain supremacy). #MakeMathiPegBeronAgain (Is this a joke? Is it? Decide for yourselves. ;) ) Aside from sharing headcanons nobody asked for, Mathi is also a big fan of superheroes and her biggest toxic relationship is with Marvel Rivals. Oh, oh, and she is also the artist behind Hamlin (Hamster Tamlin) and that one ACOTAR tweets account.

  
  
We also have u/teethmissing who is really cool and nice and also funny (sometimes) and also your new bestie. Teeth is currently working on a Rhysta fanfic, drinks a lot of coffee, and enjoys debating Maasverse theories with other redditors. They also enjoy knitting, baking, playing battle ships with u/ebbriar, and dueling with swords in their spare time. Ask them about how many teeth they’ve collected over the years- the number will shock you!

  
  
And last and totally least, u/ebbriar will not take comment on her para-social relationship with Azriel—and that Azris x OC fic in the making is totally *not* a self-insert. Briar loves to discuss both ACOTAR and Maasverse theories, though be prepared for her to crash out when your theory makes too much sense, because sjm what are we *DOING* here? Release us from this pain of uncertainty. The anticipatory doom of POV and ship reveals. *RELEASE US!!—* Anyways. When Briar miraculously isn’t thinking about faeries and fae, and all the faeries and fae she wants to kiss and kiss each other (and Teeth), she’s cozying it up on Stardew, unironically listening to sea shanties, or forcing her friend to watch her favorite shows and movies for the first time (specifically for the wonderfully entertaining live reactions).



We’re really excited to be expanding our team and we look forward to this next chapter of the ACOTAR subreddit with you all! Feel free to ask us anything about the books or our likes!

\- The ACOTAR moderating team

[Update at 2080 hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1lhsx92/2080_hours_of_learning_th_with_input_can_i_even/)

For contrast to my comprehensible input method, you can read these reports from learners who are using traditional methods for Thai:

[3000 hours of traditional methods for Thai](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnthai/comments/1nrrnm9/3000_hour_thai_learning_update/)   
[Far over 3000 hours of traditional methods for Thai](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnthai/comments/1hwele1/language_lessons_from_a_lifelong_learner/) 

One takeaway I took from these other reports is that learning Thai takes a *very* long time, regardless of methods. I feel quite happy with my results so far and don’t feel I’m behind in any way.

###Prerequisite Disclaimer

This is a report of my personal experience using comprehensible input. This is not an attack on you if you enjoy explicit grammar study, flashcards, vocabulary, learning podcasts, Duolingo, etc. I am not going to break into your house and burn your textbooks.

I'm just sharing my experience with a learning style that I'm enjoying and that I've been able to stick with. I'm excited to talk about something that's working for me, personally, and hoping that my post can give insight to other learners interested in comprehensible input / [automatic language growth](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgdZTyVWfUhlcP3Wj__xgqWpLHV0bL_JA) as a learning method.

I think everyone has different learning styles, and while we may be on different journeys, we're all aiming for similar destinations as far as being able to use and live with our TLs. Language learners are as diverse and unique as the languages and cultures we're studying, and I'm happy to celebrate our diversity in learning styles.

I hope we all achieve our goals, even if we're on different paths!

###TL;DR of earlier updates:

American splitting time between Bangkok and the US. Mostly monolingual previously (studied Japanese for a couple years), started to seriously look at learning Thai in December 2022.

I used a *pure* comprehensible input approach with a silent period followed by reading/speaking. No analytical grammar, no textbooks, no flashcards, no Thai-to-English translations, no dictionary lookup, etc. I delayed speaking and reading for roughly my first year and a half (after I started to develop a good ""ear"" and intuition for Thai).

All I did for the first ~1000 hours was watch comprehensible input by Thai teachers. Everything is 100% in Thai, initially supplemented with drawings, gestures, and pictures to aid understanding.

###Learning Summary of Past 5 Months

My daily hours was much lower than the first half of 2025. I had some unexpected issues involving the health of a family member, a lot of travel for this issue, and also more work than usual. During this period, my daily practice time has been more like 1-2 hours a day versus my goal of 4+ hours.

As a result, I am 400 hours short of my goal of hitting 3000 hours in 2025. A little disappointed to have missed the target, but that’s life. I started 2025 with almost exactly 1500 hours, so my total this year was 1100 hours.

###Current Learning Routine

Each week, I’m doing a mix of:

* Private lessons, where I watch native content with my teachers and they explain words/phrases I don’t understand (my questions and teacher explanations 100% in Thai)  
* Calls with a Thai friend, where we do the same thing as (1). He kindly offered to do this for free.  
* Consuming native content on my own (mostly YouTube and Netflix, sometimes Disney+)  
* Conversation with Thai friends (varies a lot week to week)  
* Reading practice  

I track my learning separately across input, crosstalk, shadowing, 100% Thai conversation, and reading. 90% of my total study so far has been listening input. I call my lessons “input”, though I am speaking Thai during these lessons - but I’m mostly listening to the content and teachers, so it’s more on the input side.

Increasingly I find these categories kind of meaningless as more and more of my life just switches over to Thai. Even my “reading” practice I’m also swapping between audio tracks (which I understand better) as I read. I roughly guess the time I spend talking with Thai friends over coffee, at the gym, etc but it’s hard to measure precisely.

My YouTube and IG reel algorithm recommendations are now 99% Thai. I do not watch English videos, movies, or TV unless I can find a Thai dub for it.

My study is 100% time engaged with native Thai. Native content, breaking down native content with teachers (both myself and the teachers speaking Thai), speaking with natives, shadowing native content, practicing reading as I listen to a native read the same material, etc.

###Comprehension

Using the Dreaming Spanish Roadmap as a guide, I am currently in the middle of Level 6 (after the 2x adjustment for distant languages).

Since my last update, I have been continuing to develop my listening ability for different domains. I’m currently working through the following kinds of content with my teachers:

* Political/economic analysis or explainers (example: [The Standard Global Economic Background about Vietnam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Un9PKD7NQ))  
* Buddhism and East/Southeast Asian history (example: [Point of View “Why didn’t Buddha shave his head?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg2NddBtZTc&list=PLfqt6BlTNYnWyd9GaeC3auC7-4rzpfi1K&index=4))  
* Podcasts to get used to the slurring, slang, and other modifications in much more casual speech (example: [Happy Hour Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUzJCGFj7kY))  
* News to get used to very formal speech (such as [The Standard News Digest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RyS_JmwCDI&list=PLZ0vRaBzdrQ23WCN5v4wdJl1-67bOaqBs))  
* IG reels and other short form meme videos, to get more familiar with viral trends and humor ([example](https://www.instagram.com/p/DRhFD44j0Mx/)

The following kinds of content I find enjoyable and understandable on my own:

* True crime podcasts such as [Tang Makkaporn](https://www.youtube.com/@tangmakkaporn)  
* Point of View videos on Western history, science, or other videos for which I have context ([Why doesn’t Thailand have nuclear power plants?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEkCsXsIzf4))

* Medical videos and case studies by [Dr Tany](https://www.youtube.com/@DrTany)  
* Thai romantic comedies such as Friendzone  
* Lots of dubbed content that I’ve seen before in English, such as Disney movies, Harry Potter, Adventure Time, Rick and Morty, all kinds of anime, etc.

My ability to understand Thai in-person is improving but is hard to quantify exactly. Group conversations are becoming easier, but still not fully comfortable. One-on-one is easy, me plus two natives is manageable, more than that is not comfortable yet. 

I have noticed that my ability to understand what’s being said even in medium noisy environments has improved a lot. I can have a one-on-one conversation even in a quite noisy environment now. Two-on-one is also manageable in a lot of medium noisy situations. 

###Output

I’ve done around 150 hours of conversation practice, maybe as high as 175 hours if you were to include my speaking time during lessons. So roughly double the amount of conversation practice compared to my last update.

My overall comfort is improving. I’m more fluid in more situations now. I can speak in more detail now than I could before and my active vocabulary is greater.

Types of conversations I’m having now that I couldn’t before:

Talking about health issues, including terms like blood pressure, clots, veins, etc.  
Discussing the border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, and my opinions on how it relates to elite families in both countries.  
Economic issues in Thailand and contrasting them with issues faced in other countries, such as the US and Vietnam
Explaining the plot of *The Little Prince* in Thai and talking about why I love it (did this at a Thai book club)

To be clear, I am not nearly as eloquent or smooth when talking about these topics as I am in English. I am sometimes awkward, often talking around terms I don’t know, etc. But I am able to convey my thoughts and have real conversations about these topics.

Socializing with friends is extremely comfortable now. I will occasionally have moments where I struggle to express something in Thai with my friends, but for the most part, we just talk in Thai and both my comprehension and speaking is automatic. I continue to joke around quite a lot and I’m becoming more and more comfortable with humor. A big goal of mine for 2026 is to become comfortable with คำผวน (spoonerism jokes), which is a major component of Thai humor that’s quite challenging for foreigners.

###Reading

I’ve done close to 60 hours of reading practice. I had spent the first 10-20 hours doing lessons with my teacher in Thai about the writing system, practicing with children’s books/videos, and reading anime subtitles in Thai along with the Thai manga.

Next, I read *The Little Prince*. I read along with [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6yjE7nPJRLUHRgi1weoXGgNH7b7w6BH6) from Khroo Arty. I would practice reading the line to myself, then listen to Khroo Arty’s version, and do this for many rounds. I also had a physical copy of the book. After doing reading practice with the video series, I would try to read the physical chapter on my own.

Altogether this process took me close to 20 hours.

I’ve now started *Harry Potter*, using a physical copy of the book along with [Khroo Ying’s reading video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVgbjcPhDnM&list=PLJNAiwdavGjHgJEhMIeBRqNVe5mmHRXl5&index=11) of it. My edition of the book is slightly different, but probably more than 98% the same, so there’s no issues using the audio for assistance.

It currently takes me about 20 minutes per page. I’m 20 pages in and the book is 300 pages long. I’m hoping my speed improves significantly before the end or it’s going to be a while. It’s slow partially because I am combining audio listening with the reading, but in combination the book is highly understandable for me.

Although it still has a long way to go, my reading has improved to the point where it’s practical for me to text in Thai with my friends. I can’t spell on my own and have done basically no writing practice, so I use voice-to-text in Thai. I read back the phone’s typing to myself and can catch/fix most mistakes. The end result is mostly accurate though I will sometimes catch errors after I’ve sent the message.

Overall, I’ve found reading to be fun and it feels very natural after having so much practice understanding the spoken language. I have very few problems with word boundaries, which is a common complaint among Thai learners (Thai writing has no spaces between words).

Also, a large proportion of questions on /r/learnthai are questions about why some word is spelled a certain way. Essentially the Thai equivalent of “Why is ‘ceiling’ spelled with a ‘c’?” I came into reading with no expectations that a word “should” be spelled some way or “shouldn’t” be spelled some way; I just read it and accept that as the spelling.

Even without having seen a word before, I can usually figure out the words I’m encountering based on a combination of the characters and context, even for unusual-looking words such as มหัศจรรย์ or ศาสตราจารย์ or ธรรมดา. Words I can’t figure out by reading I almost always know from the audio. 

The foreign/magic words in Harry Potter are tripping me up, but I’m getting used to them, and the audio backing is definitely saving me there.

###Challenges

Aside from life getting in the way a bit the past half year, it doesn’t feel like I’m facing any significant challenges at the moment. More than ever, I’m convinced that if I just continue to meaningfully practice understanding and speaking Thai, I will improve.

Last time I was talking about feeling like my listening ability was improving more slowly. Since then I’ve noticed significant improvement again. My reading habit is steady and I expect as I do that more, it’ll help refine things about my comprehension and speech (though I don’t think I’ve yet done enough of it to notice significant impact).

One thing I need to do is practice shadowing more. I think I’m avoiding it because I don’t like listening to the sound of my own voice, but I think it’s necessary if I’m going to continue improving my accent and flow.

I did have another check-in with Khroo Pannapat (formerly known as Khroo Issara), who is a linguist and phonetics expert. She confirmed that some of my previous accent markers have been resolved, in particular the traces of a Japanese accent (which I consider a remnant from a failed two-year attempt to learn Japanese in my 20s). Since I’ve done relatively little shadowing or other conscious accent correction, I consider this promising, and hope it improves further as I shadow and read more.

###Final Thoughts

This month marks 3 years since I started learning Thai. At the beginning of December 2022, I knew almost zero Thai. I had heard the phrases for “hello” and “thank you”, and I could awkwardly utter a butchered version of these words.

Three years later, Thai is an integral part of my life.

When I wake up and have coffee in the morning, I listen to The Standard KND talk about language learning in Thai. When I go for a jog, I listen to the Happiness by Noticing podcast. When I’m commuting on the train, I listen to Thai standup comedy and try not to laugh out loud. I sing karaoke in Thai (only know a couple songs so far but working on practicing more!).

When I want to relax, I watch Adventure Time or Rick & Morty or Star Trek in Thai. When my friends come over to my place for dinner, we watch Thai romcoms.

When I wanted to know what was happening at the Thai-Cambodian border, I watched Point of View explain it. When my family member started having health issues, I watched Dr. Tany videos about the condition.

I go to book clubs in Thai. Joke around with my friends at the gym in Thai. Catch up over dinner and coffee in Thai. Gossip about the weird behavior of foreigners one table over in Thai. Watch brainrot reels in Thai and inflict those reels on my friends. Give my friends shit in Thai. Make small talk with taxi cab drivers about inflation and current events.

I’m not fluent. But I’m living my life more and more in Thai, and I love it. It’s enriched my life in so many ways, let me meet and connect with people I never would’ve otherwise gotten to know. 

I think about how fortunate I am that I came to learn Thai: a language that just happens to have an abundance of comprehensible input resources, including incredible teachers with cumulative decades of experience teaching via Automatic Language Growth. An unorthodox learning method that meshes perfectly with my personality. 

And it’s a language that is so incredibly funny, with an ambiguous structure that lends itself to humor and wordplay. Spoken by a culture and people whose kind-heartedness matches perfectly with their love of all things silly and fun.

2025 was a hard year in many ways, but looking back on the past three years, I can’t help but feel fortunate to have come this far and to have gotten so much out of this journey. I hear all the time from naysayers telling me that my path is inefficient, nonsensical, stupid.

But I’ve loved every bit of it.

As always, thanks everyone for reading and good luck to all of us on our respective journeys. Happy early new year and see everyone at 3000 hours.",5,1767031927.0,languagelearning,0,0.86,False

# Beyond the Bean: Why Your Local Coffee Roaster Matters

Forget the generic supermarket bags. The true magic of coffee often lies hidden within your own community, at the hands of passionate local roasters. These aren't just businesses; they're artisans dedicated to bringing you the freshest, most flavorful coffee possible. They source beans with intention, roast them with precision, and ultimately, deliver a cup that tells a story.

When you choose a local roaster, you're not just buying coffee; you're investing in a unique experience. You gain access to a wider spectrum of origins and roast profiles, often unavailable in larger chains. Plus, the freshness factor is unparalleled. Beans roasted just days, or even hours, before you buy them preserve their peak aroma and taste – a noticeable difference you can savor with every sip.

*   **Fresher Coffee:** Locally roasted beans are typically sold much closer to their roast date, maximizing aroma and flavor.
*   **Unique Flavors:** Discover diverse single-origin beans and expertly crafted blends you won't find anywhere else.
*   **Support Your Community:** Buying local keeps money circulating within your neighborhood and supports small business owners.

Ready to elevate your morning ritual? Visit a local coffee roaster near you and taste the difference.

1pytf5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivingUncertainty/comments/1pytf5m/in_2025_the_cost_of_living_has_evolved_from_an/,"In 2025, the ""cost of living"" has evolved from an economic metric into a pervasive emotional weight.","Recent studies have coined the term ""Stressflation"" to describe the unique psychological toll of an economy where prices rise faster than the spirit can adapt. While the numbers on the receipt are objective, the feelings they trigger—shame, isolation, and a relentless ""background hum"" of anxiety—are deeply personal. Here is how the high cost of living is fundamentally reshaping our emotional landscapes. The ""Always On"" Survival BrainFor many, the most exhausting part of 2025 isn't just the lack of funds; it’s the cognitive load required to manage them. Decision Fatigue: Every choice, from a brand of detergent to a weekend coffee, now requires a mental ""audit"". This constant scanning for deals and trade-offs keeps the brain in a state of high alert. Hyper-Vigilance: According to 2025 surveys, nearly 70% of Americans experience financial anxiety more than once a week. 4 This ""survival mode"" can lead to physical symptoms like disrupted sleep (reported by 77%) and chronic tension headaches. The Erosion of ""Micro-Joys""Psychologists note that human resilience often relies on small, low-stakes pleasures—a spontaneous movie night, a favorite brand of snack, or a hobby. The Sacrifice: As budgets tighten, these ""micro-joys"" are often the first to go. When life becomes a cycle of only ""working to pay for the essentials,"" it can lead to a sense of learned helplessness or a ""graying out"" of daily life. The ""Luxury"" Guilt: Even when people do spend on themselves, the pleasure is frequently undercut by a ""guilt-afterglow,"" where the emotional cost of a treat outweighs its benefit. The Social Tax: Isolation and ""Frugality Shame""Money is often the ""hidden guest"" at every social gathering. In 2025, the inability to keep up with friends' spending habits is a major driver of loneliness. Self-Isolation: To avoid the awkwardness of declining an expensive dinner, many people simply stop responding to invites. This creates a ""loneliness loop"" where financial stress is compounded by a lack of social support. The Comparison Trap: Despite the rise of ""Loud Budgeting,"" social media still fuels a sense of inadequacy. Seeing others seemingly unaffected by inflation can trigger feelings of personal failure, even when the causes are systemic. Relationship ""Pressure Cookers""Financial strain is rarely contained within an individual; it spills into the home. The 2025 Data: Roughly 67% of adults report that economic pressure has caused significant strain in their personal relationships this year. The Blame Game: Couples often find themselves arguing over ""lifestyle creep"" or minor purchases, which are actually proxies for the deeper, shared fear of instability.Emotional Impact by the Numbers (2025) Impact AreaKey StatisticMental Health 83% of adults say the economy is hurting their mental well-being. Social Life 23% of people are meeting friends less often due to costs. Healthcare 66% have delayed mental health treatment because of the price. Sleep 87% report ""economic insomnia"" (waking up worried about bills). Moving Toward ""Emotional Resilience"" While we cannot control global inflation, experts suggest a few shifts to protect your mental health: ""Name it to Tame it"": Acknowledging that your anxiety is a rational response to an irrational economy can reduce personal shame. Schedule ""Worry Windows"": Instead of let money anxiety hum in the background all day, set 15 minutes to review your accounts, then ""close the tab"" mentally for the rest of the day. Find Free Connection: Prioritize ""low-cost, high-connection"" activities—like a walk or a library visit—to break the link between spending and socializing. The most important thing to remember? You aren't ""failing"" at life because things are expensive. You are navigating a historic economic shift, and your emotional well-being is a legitimate ""budget item"" worth protecting.",1,1767031699.0,SurvivingUncertainty,0,1.0,False

1pyteqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pyteqt/coffeeshop_theatrics/,Coffeeshop Theatrics,"Fresh from my day off, I witnessed a lady enter into the coffee shop making a hate-filled rant about dicks. I wasn't more shocked on the hate that this lady spewed, but how eloquent her rant was . She included the history and the plague of what the male penis had did to women for centuries. I'll admit, I was impressed by the lady and her intellectual dick rant.Well, hours later after having my third cup of coffee, I observed around and then zeroed in on a bum right outside the coffee shop masterbating. All the patrons didn't bother to look at this crazy guy; which I thought was weird. The bum ejaculated the very next minute and what he did afterwards was simply strange. The bum moisturized his hair with his semen and continued walking as if nothing happened.


 I was so shocked at what I seen,I simply shook my head for the next few minutes in disbelief. Later on at the coffee shop, things appeared normal again . College students getting off school and ordering their customized frappucinos. Hot girls grouping up together at one table and talking about their day. All seemed well, until a girl ran inside and to the middle of the shop. She put on her music player, plugged in her headphones, and started dancing as if her life depended on it. A few patrons glanced and then looked away.


 Then the semen bum reappeared, but inside the coffee shop this time. For me, this was too good to not look. The bum whipped out his pecker, held it, and danced to the movements of the girl. He was getting closer to the girl until, one of the male patrons drop-kicked his ass and threw him out by the dick. Everybody cheered but the girl, she stopped dancing and started to look confused. Patrons just stared at the girl. I tried to wave but the girl just heaved her headphones right dead smack in my forehead and dashed the hell out of there. An older man from across me, stopped reading his newspaper; and started laughing his ass off. The old man was laughing so hysterically that he  slapped his knees and banged his hands on the table. I simply didn't say anything and eventually, the old man returned to reading his newspaper. 


The next twenty minutes returned to normal; consumer after consumer ordering their coffee. I was set to leave . I have had enough excitement for one day. Before I could open the door to exit; the semen guy pushed me back and whipped his thing out again. I stepped a few feet back away from this freak. The crazy guy’s hair was sticking up like a porcupine. He then held out his dick as if it were some type of gun. The same guy who threw the semen guy out, ran towards him only to be monumentally dick slapped. It was like a fast scene out of an action movie. The brave guy positioned his feet, launched towards the bum; but before he could tackle him, the semen guy jumped high and nailed the guy with a hard dick thump to the forehead. The brave guy then collapsed. Then I heard an older lady shriek of terror. A hippie that worked there was shocked and uttered.


 “ Dude, this homeless guy must be the evil dick villain here to kill us all!” The hippies boss gave him a big slap to the back of the head. As I laughed, the semen villain shouted. “Oh Mary Joseph! She’s going to blow!” All the patrons, including me, screamed like hell and jumped back. The bum quickly ejaculated and he came so hard that he literally broke his back. Everybody including the bum led out a big sigh. All semen terror was over and the bum was transported to the nearest local hospital. I then quickly ran out the coffee shop, and onto my way home. I was almost home, but the crazy dancing girl who threw her headphones at me was starting to chase me. I threw the headphones back to her, sped up , and opened my front door like I was being wanted by the police. I immediately locked the door. I must say that coffee shop was like a theatrical weird place. I'm glad I'm now home and away from that theatrical coffee shop!

Hi! I (23F) and my fiancé (26M) recently opened a coffee shop 4 months ago. I asked for help sa friend ‘kong barista with what to do, and asked for advices and such. Of course it shouldn’t be an issue diba? (Been friends for 2 years na). I also hired another friend from the same circle. They’ve been ganging up on me eversince, kesyo concerned sa cafè and all. Honestly as an owner what should I do? Puro sila reklamo na I wasn’t doing my job properly. Anyways fast-forward nawala na si other friend ang natira nalang si barista. Before mag-open yung cafè and mag-start with construction I already told him na kukunin ‘ko sya, then a week before mag-start ang sabi nya he got offered a job sa city namin lets just call the cafè ‘ACoffee’ as head barista na 475/4hours daw if gusto ‘ko daw tapatan ‘ko ang salary nya so ginawa naming 120/hour I admit it was my lack of research and I really trusted him. Last 2 weeks ago si ACoffee nag-open, I instantly noticed their cups di-sticker yung logo sa cups so my thought went ‘oh, thats weird they can pay sa ganong kataas na salary but couldn’t have their cups printed’ I immediately contacted the owner since I was having this weird gut feeling— turns out 570 per day ang head barista nila. That 475/4 hours never existed, I asked if may na-offeran sila NONE daw. Then these past few days sinisingil nya ako sa “recipe” since sya nag-create nga ng recipe. Heres the thing tho, we never had any agreement that I would pay for this “recipe”, he never brought it up but I was really planning to buy one of those google drives recipes na worth 200-1k na andun lahat. When we created our cafès menu and recipe everyone participated naman, it was our equipments and ingredients ang naconsume at ginamit. Sinisingil nya kami ng 15-25k (10 drinks) and if ‘di daw namin ipapackage 1k per drink. Our cafe has 25-30 drinks, so you guys do the math na. Tried asking sa mga cafè owners from different places to Manila and provinces iisa ang sinasabi LUGI daw kami. Also if we were to put out a branch daw magpapabayad muna ng recipe si barista bago daw sya pumayag, and the recipe?

I'm ready to give up all my earthly possessions and go live off the land, somewhere deep in the woods. Not really. I would last all of 6 hours if I did that.

As a near 40-year old male, I find it incredibly difficult to meet new friends. What are people in our age demographic supposed to do? I tried hanging around a bookstore, hoping to find someone, but now I'm not allowed within 50 feet of the place because apparently, ""begging people who walk into the bookstore to talk to you, while on your knees and offering beverages"" is a crime? Ppssshh.

I wish I could tempt you to talk to me by telling you all these cool adventures I have. All these hobbies that are super unique and cool. But, alas, it's not like that. I'm a fairly normal individual as far as to what a man my age is into. Think of most cliche hobbies of a man in the middle of his life and there's a good chance I'm into it. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

\- Hovering around the couch, watching TV, without actually sitting down

\- Finding WW2 ""really interesting""

\- Checking gas prices at all the local gas stations before feeling up because, a penny saved is a penny earned

\- Turning on a movie after 7:00pm, only to fall asleep about 20 minutes into it

\- Smoking / grilling all sorts of meats even when the temperature is too cold outside

In all actuality, I am a rare bird in the sense that I THINK I have an impressive understanding of what makes me FEEL. I don't mind talking about my feelings. I also happen to be a student of human nature; I pay attention to all the things that you DON'T say, and draw conclusions on who you REALLY are. It's a blessing and a curse.

When it comes down to the brass tacks of it, I'm a guy who enjoys good music, good food, and enjoying the little things in life. I don't need to go vacation every summer or do much to have a good time. At night I like picking up a good book and getting lost for an hour or so before bed, and I always grab an energy drink before I leave for work because I wasted so much time playing with my dogs that I don't have time to make a cup of coffee before I head out the door.

I have been working my way up to 1mg for the past two months, and the last few weeks of 0.5 mg I have been dealing with extreme fatigue (I have lost 10lbs though lol yay). But I can barely get going in the morning, and throughout the day i’m so tired. Thankfully I have been on winter break from university  for the last few weeks and not working as much so I have time for the extra sleep. I have been trying to go for like 30min-hour walks a few times a week to see if that helps also.

On christmas day, I went to bed at 8 pm and my whole family was confused lol. Usually on christmas day I am a let’s have a few drinks and stay up till 12 am type of girly but I also can’t get any alcohol down anymore (a good thing for me personally lol). I’ve been sleeping like 12 hours everynight the past 2 weeks. Actually I can barely write this right now lol i’m just so sluggish.

Has anyone else dealt w fatigue and did it lessen as time went on ? I’m going back to university  next week and going to be working more and i’m scared I won’t be able to do it because of the fatigue. Guess I just have to push through. I am an avid coffee drinker, but I have been dealing with dry mouth (idk if it’s related to oz) and drinking coffee makes my dry mouth worse in my experience, so haven’t been drinking it as much. If this side effect doesn’t go away in a month or two, and I can’t ride it out, I honestly might debate getting off of oz.

I go to bed at 7 am, wake up at 3 pm, I am rarely exposed to sunlight. I have several problems, stomach acid, often eating late, smoking and drinking coffee on an empty stomach. 

I always notice my anxiety flares up when I'm in a coffee shop. So many people, so loud talking and joking. I often go alone, when I'm alone at the table next to me there's a group of people, for some reason when they're joking or laughing, I always feel like they're laughing at me, I always feel that way, I even realize they're just minding their own business, but I don't feel like that. Sometimes when I'm with friends, when I say something, it's as if someone is following what I'm saying. The more stressed I was, the more cigarettes I smoked and coffee I drank, and that made almost my whole body shake violently.

I've tried many ways to reduce my anxiety, but I feel nothing is different until now. I don't take medication, nor have I ever gone to a psychiatrist directly. Now all I can do is try to change my habits. Often I look for a match to my anxiety-related habits.

And I started working out, walking, jogging, weights, etc. And I lost about 50lbs. 
I am super excited, loving my slimmer, lighter body. And the ease of moving my body, since the lifestyle has also eliminated the inflammation in my joints, giving me mobility that I had assumed was just a lost party of my youth! 
Where I need help is with my upper body, my chest. My ribs are too visible, making me look much older than my 53 years. 
Is there a way to add weight to that part of my body, without the use of sugar? Any workouts that will put muscle there and hide my bones?

Fellow students - how much do you spend monthly on groceries?

Mine is 350 euro, and it kinda frightens me.

I mostly shop at Albert Heijn because they have great occasional deals, and Delhaize.

I heard Delhaize is the ""premium"" brand, but honestly the prices are somewhat similiar to Colruyt, especially if you buy house-brand products.

My meals are the usual base / carb + 1 serving of protein, and some sauce or toppings like Parmesan / herbs etc. Maybe with a beverage like milk or coffee.

It seems on average, for my home-cooked meals, 1 serving is around 5-7 euros. I.e. 1 pack of chicken costs around 6 euro (serves 2), 1 pack of gnocci costs 3 euro (serves 2). So that's already like 4.5 euro per home-cooked meal, and the extra 1-2 euro, we can chalk it up to toppings / drinks / sauces / an egg etc.

What am I doing wrong?!?! Its not like I buy Wagyu beef, chickens are the most basic form of proteins.

Edit: Asking cuz it seems the recommended allowance to live in Leuven is 1000 euro. But 350 for food + 450 for rent (already on the low side) is 800...man, a couple of nights out at the fakbar or brussels and that 200 is gone :(",5,1767030749.0,Leuven,19,1.0,False

1pysytn,https://i.redd.it/1bd1si7kl6ag1.jpeg,What reason is there to upgrade?,"So I have a Gaggia Classic Pro 2019. I have modded the OPV to 9 bar, I have the Shade of Coffee PID, and I have the one hole steam tip. I drink 2 coffees a day at most, sometimes I make a third for the Mrs. I usually split my shots, one milky and one straight. 

I’m usually quite obsessive when it comes to gear acquisition, but I can’t see the need for most people in a home setting to need to upgrade from a modded GCP. I know my needs will obviously be different than others, but I’d be interested in the reasons why people decided to upgrade from their GCP. If you wanted an upgrade to various extraction options, there’s a wealth of mods EG gaggimate and gagguino. Personally I don’t like overly ‘techy’ upgrades as I find the fuss can often make the tech feel aged when I inevitably can’t be bothered to fiddle with it after the novelty for me wears off, but I can see how it’s useful for others. 

You then have the more standard mods such as PID, dimmer controls and OPV. The only upgrade I could imagine is a dual boiler, but even then, is the time saved really at that much of a premium when it comes to the home set up, to necessitate the upgrade in cost from the GCP? 

I’m genuinely interested to know, as someone who constantly looks towards machines like the Micra and Bianca and then walks back when actually questioning my needs, what reason is there to upgrade?

I love him dearly. People say we're yin and yang, two sides of the same coin. His attachment style had created a lot of problems for our relationship in the past, but he's truly done SO much work to be a better partner. He is one of the most genuinely kind people I've ever known.

And yet.

He still hides things from me. We're so close that I swear I can SENSE when he's hiding something before I even have evidence. On Halloween, I couldn't sleep at all, and was almost panicking without knowing why; turns out he was making out with a woman he'd SWORN to me he wasn't actually pursuing. A couple of weeks ago, I knew something was off, and he vehemently denied hiding anything, even when I kept pressing. Finally, after some space, he called me and admitted that he'd had coffee with a woman he used to hook up with, and that he didnt know why he was fighting so hard to hide it. I told him I appreciated him telling me the truth, even if it was belated. 

I think he's hiding something again. I can't explain it - it was in the way he looked at me while he kissed me this morning, almost TOO lovingly, which isn't like him. It breaks my heart. Even after all the work he's done and how much we truly love one another, he still sneaks around with other women (and it's extra frustrating, because we are polyamorous; he would be able to freely date other women if he would just COMMUNICATE). 

I love this man, body and soul. But I've been so patient. I've been encouraging and supportive of the strides he's made. I've worked on my own anxious tendencies, and our relationship is so much stronger and deeper than it was, but I think maybe this is just a hurdle that we cannot get over. Should I keep holding on?

1pysvd5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivingUncertainty/comments/1pysvd5/the_final_sweep_freecycling_everyday_essentials/,The Final Sweep: Freecycling Everyday Essentials and Moving Must-Haves,"When we think of ""donating,"" we often think of big bags of clothes or old furniture. But the true magic of freecycling lies in the everyday essentials—those miscellaneous items that feel too small to sell but are too useful to throw away.



From the boxes in your garage to the unused lotions in your bathroom, these ""miscellaneous"" items are often the fastest to disappear from a curb or a porch because they solve immediate, practical problems for your neighbors.



1. The Power of ""Miscellaneous""

Don't underestimate the demand for these common household leftovers. These are the items that keep a community running smoothly:



Extra Hangers: It sounds simple, but anyone who has recently moved or upgraded their wardrobe knows the frustration of running out of hangers. Whether they are plastic, wire, or velvet, someone nearby likely needs them.



Books: Books are meant to be read, not to gather dust. Current bestsellers and children's picture books are perennial favorites in freecycling groups and ""Little Free Libraries.""



Packing Materials: If you’ve just moved, your garage is likely full of ""gold."" Sturdy boxes, bubble wrap, and clean packing paper are highly sought after. Offering these up saves a neighbor a $50 trip to a moving supply store.



Pet Supplies: Pets can be picky! If your dog refuses to sleep in that expensive new bed or your cat ignores a specific toy, pass it on. Crates, leashes, and unopened bags of food are also high-demand items for local rescues.



Unopened Toiletries: We all have them—the hotel shampoo samples, the ""gift with purchase"" perfume, or the lotion that didn't quite suit us. If they are unopened, they are perfect for neighbors in need or local shelters.



2. Three Golden Rules for Successful Freecycling

To make the process as smooth as possible for both you and the recipient, follow these three simple ""pro-tips"":



Be Honest and Detailed

Transparency is the currency of freecycling. If a toaster takes two cycles to get the bread golden brown, or if a rug has a small coffee stain in the corner, mention it! People will still want the item, but being honest ensures it goes to someone who can actually use it in its current condition.



Photos are Worth a Thousand Words

A listing with a photo is ten times more likely to be claimed than a text-only post. You don’t need professional lighting—just a quick snap on your phone to show the color, size, and condition. It helps the recipient know exactly what they are driving over to collect.



Embrace the ""Porch Pickup"" (PPU)

Coordinating schedules with a stranger can be the most stressful part of giving things away. Save yourself the headache by offering Porch Pickup. Simply leave the item in a bag or box on your doorstep at a designated time. This allows the recipient to swing by at their convenience and keeps your afternoon free.



The Big Picture: Why We Give

Freecycling isn't just about getting rid of stuff; it's about reimagining our relationship with ""waste."" When you give away packing boxes or a half-used bottle of shampoo, you are participating in a circular economy that prioritizes people over landfills. You’re making your neighbor’s move a little easier, their pet a little happier, or their bookshelf a little fuller.",1,1767030518.0,SurvivingUncertainty,0,1.0,False

At first I thought alcohol was the issue, I'd been drinking 2-3 beers ""most nights"" for a while. So I cut out nearly all alcohol, and in the past 2 months I have only drank on 3 occasions. While I am sleeping better, going mostly sober from alcohol didn't seem to impact my brain fog at all, which was very disappointing.

Now I'm starting to wonder if coffee/caffeine is the root of my issue. After drinking my morning coffee I'll typically have a couple hours of mental clarity, then it's back to the brain fog norm for the rest of the day. I didn't drink coffee for most of my 20s, I was originally a tea-only person. I would have coffee like once or twice a week to start around 2021, and then in 2023 I started drinking one cup of coffee daily.

I use freshly roasted, whole bean coffee. 25-30 grams to make my cup, which I'm now learning could have over 300mg of caffeine in my ""one cup"", as Arabica beans are typically 1.2-1.5% caffeine by weight. But I'm also questioning the other compounds in coffee. I know tea has L-theanine which helps provide a calmer feeling of energy, and in the years I was only drinking tea I was not battling this level of brain fog.

I skipped coffee yesterday and today, opting for tea instead. I can't focus on anything at all today, the fog is worse than ever. I'm hoping that's a good sign of withdrawal and that things will get better with continuing to abstain from coffee.

I've pretty much cut all the ""bad for you"" things out of my life (junk food, alcohol) so if coffee isn't the root of my brain fog I have no clue what to do. I swear I didn't used to be this forgetful, unfocused and stupid feeling.",2,1767030375.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

(I've been injured for the past year and haven't been able to run, but I've been making sure to use the exercise bike and do whatever weight training my body can handle.) Ever since sexual maturity, I have had what seemed to be an abnormally-high sex drive. I would usually masturbate 1-3 times a day, even during my 30's. If I was on a date with someone and I really liked them, it was pretty normal for me to get an erection just sitting and talking to them. Things changed over the last 2 years or so, though.

I started noticing that it became particularly difficult for me to get/maintain an erection while standing. It also seemed that I would usually only get erections if I was watching porn, and even those would take a while to form. During sex, there has been a mixed bag. Sometimes, I get erections without a problem. Sometimes, it's pretty much impossible. (For over 2 decades, I've regularly watched porn, but I had no problems getting frequent erections and/or getting erections during sex.) I confided in a friend of mine who is in his 50's, and he sent me some of the Cialis he takes. It definitely helped, but I don't want to just throw a pill at the problem. I probably should see a doctor, as well, but I wanted to float some ideas of things that could be contributing, based off of what I've seen online, and see if anyone has suggestions regarding their experience with any of these:

1) Caffeine instake -- My caffeine intake definitely went up since the COVID shutdown. It started with me finally caving and having coffee daily (almost always black), rather than having Starbucks Refresher drinks, caffeinated diet soda, or black tea. Over the last 2 years or so, I started getting way more caffeine fro those infamous Panera ""Charged Lemonade"" drinks, then pivoting to the much-healthier, still-caffeine-charged-but-not-quite-as-much Starbucks Iced Energy drinks. Regardless, between some morning coffee, usually followed by an Iced Energy drink and sometimes something else, I'm surely taking in more caffeine than the average adult. While smaller doses of caffeine can apparently help E.D., I've read that larger doses can contribute to it.

2) Porn use -- It's pretty normal for me to use porn 5-7 times a week. I know that porn-induced E.D. is a thing people talk about a lot. It just seems weird to me that it would be an issue \*now\* when it didn't seem to be an issue for over 20 years.

3) Unisom -- I usually take Unisom at night before bed to help fall asleep. I've read that some men do experience E.D. issues from it, since it is an antihistamine.

I don't know if anyone will read this. I'm supposed to be keeping track of the trail cameras, logging animal sightings, and making sure the park stays safe—but I can't even type properly. My hands are shaking, and I keep hearing whispering outside the cabin window. I can't… I can't see the trailhead anymore. The GPS says I'm miles from the main road, but the forest… it's different. The paths have moved.

I thought I heard footsteps, but it's not a hiker. Not anything human. It's patient, deliberate, and it's waiting for me to make a mistake. I think… I think the animals are watching me now. The deer, the foxes… even the birds. Their eyes aren't natural. There's something in the trees, and it knows I'm alone. I have to keep typing, or maybe… maybe it won't find me.

You want the whole thing from the beginning, hour by hour, so here it is. This is how it started.


---

Day 0 — Arrival

Hour 0 — 08:07 AM

I drove in with the sun low on my hood and a new pair of boots that still had the factory stiffness. Blackwood Park sits where the highway pinches between ridges and the asphalt complains into gravel; the brochure says ""untouched wilderness,"" the county site calls it ""a quiet, low-traffic area perfect for fall birdwatching."" Nobody mentioned how quiet it could become when you were the only person left.

Ranger Carter ahead of me gave me a quick tour: the tower, the cabins, where the animals tended to gather at dusk. He was a practical man with a practical laugh and a scar on his knuckle from a bear trap that never bit the same way again. He said, ""If anything weird pops up, you radio me. We don't get much out here, but you don't learn this job by reading pamphlets. You learn watching.""

He left on a humid Wednesday. I watched his truck disappear down the gravel and thought, for an instant, how ridiculous the worry was—rules and radios and maps. I had maps on my phone, a town police number, a satellite GPS device, trail camera cards that filled three plastic boxes. I felt competent. I felt safe.

Hour 4 — 12:15 PM

First day was paperwork, trail maintenance, and camera checks. I labeled things the way they wanted: camera ID, time, species sighted, weather, notes. The first handful of camera cards showed the usual—turkeys, a doe with two fawns, a raccoon with more boldness than sense.

At 12:05, camera 7 (north ridge, near the old logging trail) recorded something I wrote down as ""unidentified, low silhouette, blurred."" I assumed wind, or a raccoon too close to the lens. On my way out I found no tracks leading up to the camera, only an imprint that looked like something had knelt to peer at the sensor. It was small, like a child's kneecap indentation in wet dirt. I snapped a photo with my phone and called it curiosity.

I was tired enough that night to sleep like a stone. The sky was bruised and the tower light blinked once, twice—my own little lighthouse out here.


---

Day 1 — The Small Things

Hour 24 — 08:00 AM

I started logging hourly, because the supervisor wanted ""detailed notes"" and because writing things down made them less like thoughts and more like facts. At dawn I walked the lower loop trail—miles of hemlocks, a thin creek, moss that felt like old velvet underfoot. The air smelled of wet wood and iron. A few yards in I found a string of footprints where a hiker's boots would be, but the prints were spaced too close together, like someone taking short, careful steps. The toes of the prints were blurred, as if the soles had been smeared.

I thought of the blurry silhouette from camera 7. I told myself that hikers get lost, leave odd marks, maybe there was a child with a pacifier on the trail. Practical explanations are comforting. I like practical.

Hour 30 — 02:00 PM

Trail camera 3 recorded the same doe at 13:58, but her eyes were—my chest tightens remembering this—reflective in a way camera sensors don't produce naturally. I enlarged the photo until the pixels broke: there was a ring of light in each eye, and within the rings something darker twitched. I put the camera card in my pocket and kept walking like I wasn't carrying a small proof of wrongness.

Hour 36 — 08:00 PM

At dinner I heard a sound like fingernails over a chalkboard: a staccato chorus of bird calls that didn't pattern into anything I'd learned to read. The birds are supposed to roost before dusk. Instead, they hung in the trees and watched. A robin landed on the railing outside my cabin window and cocked its head at me until I felt pinned.

When I went to check the tower light, the tower's ladder smelled of rot though I'd cleaned it that morning. The wind had a voice then—soft, long, almost like words if you tilted your head. I shut the tower hatch and pretended the voice hadn't spoken to me.


---

Day 2 — Signs

Hour 48 — 04:00 AM

I woke to static on the radio. Carter's voice had been clear when he'd left; now nothing but hiss and the long, low swell of distant birds. I thought I'd stand watch, so I brewed bad instant coffee and went to download camera cards.

Camera 7, north ridge: at 03:58, the sensor had tripped twenty-three times in two minutes. The footage was a smear of branches and something vertical, impossibly still, that moved only the way a shadow moves when it finds a light. Every time the sensor tripped, the birds on the frame turned their heads in unison, like a single being swiveling.

Hour 54 — 10:00 AM

I found, under the cedar at the trail's bend, a small nest of things: fur, feathers, and an old hiker's bandana knotted into nothing. The bandana hadn't been reported missing, as far as I knew. There were no footprints around it. The creek nearby had a patch of slick black that shone wet and oily and wasn't oil. It caught my flashlight and reflected something that wasn't mine.

I began to dream of paths I hadn't hiked, and when I woke the smell of rich earth would still be under my nails like a lie.


---

Day 3 — People Missing

Hour 72 — 09:30 AM

Report taken: local hikers, the Halvorson pair, last seen three days ago. I am the one who finds their pack—empty, zipped shut, shoulder straps splayed like folded wings—on the trail between markers 12 and 13. No footprints in, no footprints out. The pack had been set down carefully, as if placed on a chair, and someone had stuck a pinecone on top like a hat.

I logged the discovery, wrote my observations: ""pack intact, no human scent localized, single blade of red tape tied to zipper, no signs of struggle."" I called the county. The dispatcher asked if I'd search the area. I said yes and then walked until my legs wouldn't obey me.

Hour 80 — 05:00 PM

We found evidence—bits of clothing tucked into tree bark like offerings. One sock stretched over a low branch like a ragged flag. Later, when I copied the footage from camera 12 onto my laptop, I realized the last frames were of two small shapes moving through the underbrush and then—nothing. The camera had recorded air, then the lens smudged as if something leaned against it and breathed.

The sheriff came up the next morning and looked over the same footage with an expression I couldn't read. He said the right things—""We're ramping up the search""—then left his coffee on my counter and took the road back. The town doesn't like to stay long in places where birds hang and watch.


---

Day 4 — The Trails Shift

Hour 96 — 07:30 AM

I checked the perimeter with a GPS sweep: waypoints shift, coordinates jitter like a fevered pulse. The map said the service road should be two miles east; my truck said it was three. I walked the path to the service road in daylight and found myself facing a ridge I didn't recognize—an extra rise of land curving where there had been a low meadow. The trees rearranged themselves between my morning and the walk to the truck.

I started to tape the trails, flagging branches with orange tape. I came back hours later to find them in a neat row on the other side of the trail, as if the wood had taken offense.

Hour 108 — 08:45 PM

I heard laughter one night, distant and high, like someone in the trees playing at being human. It wasn't a child's laugh. It was the sound of something practicing a joke it's never heard the answer to. The wind—again that patient wind—carried phrases that could have been syllables. I roamed the property with a rifle more for company than protection and noticed that deer had begun to congregate near the cabin in the twilight, standing in a semicircle like an audience at a small, private execution.


---

Day 6 — The Unmaking

Hour 144 — 02:00 AM

Trail camera 4 recorded at 01:57: a woman, face pale, moving parallel to the camera. She raised an arm to scratch her cheek. Her shadow lagged a second behind her, not anchored to any consistent light source. In the next frame the shadow bent where her face was and stayed bent when she walked away. The camera's timestamp hiccuped then flashed 02:03, 02:03, 02:03 until the file corrupted.

I slept less. When I closed my eyes, the trees layered themselves into hallways and I walked them until sunlight found me in an unfamiliar place. The radios fed nothing. My satellite device pinged like a dying insect.

Hour 156 — 11:00 AM

There was a smell under the pine needles—sharp, bitter, metallic. I followed it and found a site where the undergrowth had been peeled aside and a shallow pit dug clean like a spoon's spoon. In the center lay something wrapped in canvas. When I unrolled it I thought—fingers. Limbs. Human, rearranged. Not cleanly: hands had been placed wrong and the face had been worked—stretched and pinned with tiny branches into an expression that didn't belong to the owner.

I vomited behind a log. The thing was not recent. The flies were old enough to be calm. I wrapped it back because what else could I do, and left a note in my log: ""Possible predator. Evidence of post-mortem manipulation. Reported to county.""


---

Day 7 — The Eyes

Hour 168 — 05:00 AM

I started to feel observed in the cabin in the way you feel observed when someone patiently watches a photograph develop. The glass of my window held reflections that weren't mine—fragmented faces like fish caught in a net. At night the deer would press their noses to the glass and breathe fog onto the panes, their eyes catching the light in a geometry that made me think of coins.

The birds had returned with feathers slick and unnatural, and they arranged themselves in patterns on branches: circles, triangles—symbols I couldn't place but felt in my teeth like cold.

Hour 180 — 09:00 PM

I took the truck, because the road had to still be there. I followed the painted mile markers that used to lead to the highway and drove until the needle on my fuel gauge began its slow drop. The road curved. A hundred yards of pavement bowed inward like a mouth and swallowed the sky as if the day had been folded.

When I stopped and got out, the truck's tailgate was covered in a thin film of something like ash. Footprints—too many—circled the vehicle, then stopped mid-step as if whoever made them had vanished. The GPS spun as if drunk. I could not tell if I'd gone in a straight line or right in a circle.


---

Day 8 — Fractures

Hour 192 — 02:30 AM

I began leaving notes for myself taped to the coffee maker, the bathroom mirror, the file cabinet. ""If you leave, go west."" ""Do not follow the birds."" ""Radio on channel 3."" I woke up to find my notes folded and tucked like little paper birds, noses pointing toward the woods.

At 02:11, camera 9 recorded something: dozens—no, hundreds—of small shapes moving silent as spores across the floor of the valley. In the center, one shape stood upright, impossibly tall and thin, like an outline traced with a finger. It tilted its head toward the camera, and though there was no face, the camera recorded a faint high tone, a note that matched the frequency of the ringing I now heard when my ears were full of sleep.

Hour 204 — 09:00 AM

A man from town named O'Leary came up, stubborn and red-faced, looking to retrieve his brother's hiking boots. He never made it back to the truck. He walked out with the boots and my radio picked up his last transmission: ""—found the trail—"" and then nothing but a metallic tearing, like wire being pulled through old cloth.

We found O'Leary later, collapsed at the base of a tree with his eyes open and his mouth arranged in a careful, surprised ""O."" His boots were on the other side of the ridge, propped against a stump. His trousers had been buttoned wrong; the seams ran at an angle. He had scratches, shallow and neat, on the inside of his wrist—as if he'd tried to tie his own hands together to keep from doing something or to keep someone else from doing it for him.


---

Day 10 — The Cabin

Hour 240 — 11:45 PM

At night the whispering learned names. It wouldn't call me by my given name—Ranger, Carter, the new one—but by smaller things: ""the one who keeps the lists,"" ""the one with the coffee,"" ""the one who counts."" When it whispered the last one, my name felt like a shirt turned inside out.

The animals got bolder. A fox crawled under my porch with something white and frayed in its mouth—paper. When it moved, the paper was my log pages stitched together into a crude shroud. The fox sat back and bared teeth that looked too human and then trotted away into thick, impossible black.

The cameras began to show impossible times: 13:00, 25:36, 00:00 in a freeze-frame that lasted until the file corrupted. Images doubled over themselves, like two mirrors angled until the corridor becomes an infinite well.

Hour 252 — 03:00 AM

I found, in the tower's logbook (the old one Carter left), an entry not in his handwriting. No, not an entry—an address written in ink that bled into the grain of the paper. The ink read: ""Follow the turning."" Underneath, someone had drawn a map with a spiral at the center and arrows pointing inward. I tore the page out and flushed it down the toilet in a small and futile ritual of refusal.


---

Final Entries — Collapse

Hour 264 — 01:30 AM

I cannot trust time anymore. I woke to find footsteps in the frost around the cabin—too many—and in the frost were letters pressed into the ground with a blunt instrument, a message for me or from me: stay. The letters were formed by small twigs pushed into the soil, meticulous and childish.

I burned those notes. I burned my old patrol jacket because it felt like it had been watching me in the closet. I thought flames would purge it, but the smell in the smoke was the forest's scent and it clung to my tongue like a memory.

Hour 270 — 02:45 AM

I put trail cameras in the trees outside and watched them on the laptop. The feeds arranged like a choir and each one told a slightly different story. One camera showed me as I sat there, watching the camera. Another showed an empty cabin. A third showed silhouettes standing at the tree line with folded arms. When I reversed the footage frame by frame, the silhouettes made the same slow nod, as if consenting.

At 03:00 the cameras began to synchronize. The feeds stacked: one frame, one movement, one breath. In the unified image, something walked through my yard and paused directly in front of the cabin window. It did not need a face; it had angles and the suggestion of a throat that swallowed the dark.

I tried the radio. Only static, and beneath it a low honest sound like someone turning a page. The satellite device chittered once and cut out. My phone began to lose bars like teeth falling out.

Hour 276 — 03:17 AM — Entry 042

I am typing this in manic fits. My hands remember handwriting more than keyboard. I don't know which direction the road goes. I don't know whether the tower light will still work by morning. The deer pressed their noses to the glass and tapped, patient as a clock.

If anyone reads this and hears the dispatcher ask if we searched thoroughly enough, tell them we didn't. Tell them the trees rearrange. Tell them that if you go looking, the park will show you a different face the next day and then the next until you no longer remember the day you left. Tell them the animals will watch and then they will learn to stand very still and take the same breath as you. Tell them the birds will sit in patterns and map you like a route.

I can hear something under the floorboards—no, not under them. Under the ground, like water moving through tight pipes. It's patient. It likes lists. It likes order. It likes counting.

I feel tired. Not the honest tired of a night's work, but the kind of tired that means something inside you has been used up and cannot be got back. The lights flicker. The whispering says, ""Come out. Come look. See what we made.""

I don't want to go outside. I told myself not to leave the cabin tonight, but then I saw, through the trail camera feed, a boot print on the porch that wasn't there before: a small shoe, perfectly circular, no tread. Something has been walking in loops around the cabin, rearranging everything into a neat theater where I am the audience that does not get up.

I have to keep typing because if the whispering stops when I'm writing then maybe the room is only listening. Maybe typing is a ward. Maybe not. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this is only a sequence of bad nights wound together by too much loneliness.

There's a sound now like a zipper at the edge of the world. The deer are quieter. The birds have left the branch outside the window and, in the sudden absence, I can hear the creak of a branch just outside the porch. It scratches at the railing in a slow deliberate way, like someone testing a door.

If they ask what happened, tell them I tried to mark the trails. Tell them I put cameras on poles and signs that said ""NO TRESPASSING"" and ""CHRONICLE"" and I put my name on them. Tell them I did all the small things right. Tell them I logged everything. Tell them I typed, because typing seems like something they cannot take from me—this small human act, this list of hours and events.

If anyone is coming, do not follow the birds. Do not go after shadows that move on their own. If you must go, take a compass and a candle and remember that the road bends in on itself like an ear folded over. Keep counting your steps. Count them out loud. If you sound like a person with a plan, the forest will try to learn that plan and mimic it until you're so tired you cannot tell your own footsteps from a lie.

There's a tapping now against the window, like fingernails. Not nails—twigs. It spells something with rhythm: tap-tap—tap—tap. I can't read it. I don't want to. I told myself I'd never bring anyone into a place that listens.

My hands won't stop shaking. I can't feel whether the keys move because my fingertips are numb. The whispering got a syllable right then and said my name as if it had rehearsed it in front of a mirror: ""—Car—""

It doesn't know my name the way I do. It knows the shape of it.

I hear a small laugh, like a child trying on an adult's laugh and failing.

I thought I could keep the list. I thought I could make a map that would not be rewritten. I thought logs were talismans.

The door is opening now. The latch moves slow, like the first breath of a sleeper. The hinge remembers the oil and the memory of the metal gives it a little wheeze and then a scent—wet pine and iron and the thing they use to stitch things together. I can hear feet on the porch. They step in a rhythm that is not one I have taught them.

If I stop typing, assume they have found me. If you read this after, and you come for me, leave a note on the porch and back away. Leave a ring of stones and a circle of tape. The forest likes to learn patterns. It will learn which way you move.

There's a face at the window now, flat and wrong in the way things that are not meant for faces are wrong. It doesn't blink. It doesn't need to.

They're saying something—no, it's not words. It's a pattern of breaths that could be translated into words if you had the patience.",2,1767030216.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

I don't know if anyone will read this. I'm supposed to be keeping track of the trail cameras, logging animal sightings, and making sure the park stays safe—but I can't even type properly. My hands are shaking, and I keep hearing whispering outside the cabin window. I can't… I can't see the trailhead anymore. The GPS says I'm miles from the main road, but the forest… it's different. The paths have moved.

I thought I heard footsteps, but it's not a hiker. Not anything human. It's patient, deliberate, and it's waiting for me to make a mistake. I think… I think the animals are watching me now. The deer, the foxes… even the birds. Their eyes aren't natural. There's something in the trees, and it knows I'm alone. I have to keep typing, or maybe… maybe it won't find me.

You want the whole thing from the beginning, hour by hour, so here it is. This is how it started.


---

Day 0 — Arrival

Hour 0 — 08:07 AM

I drove in with the sun low on my hood and a new pair of boots that still had the factory stiffness. Blackwood Park sits where the highway pinches between ridges and the asphalt complains into gravel; the brochure says ""untouched wilderness,"" the county site calls it ""a quiet, low-traffic area perfect for fall birdwatching."" Nobody mentioned how quiet it could become when you were the only person left.

Ranger Carter ahead of me gave me a quick tour: the tower, the cabins, where the animals tended to gather at dusk. He was a practical man with a practical laugh and a scar on his knuckle from a bear trap that never bit the same way again. He said, ""If anything weird pops up, you radio me. We don't get much out here, but you don't learn this job by reading pamphlets. You learn watching.""

He left on a humid Wednesday. I watched his truck disappear down the gravel and thought, for an instant, how ridiculous the worry was—rules and radios and maps. I had maps on my phone, a town police number, a satellite GPS device, trail camera cards that filled three plastic boxes. I felt competent. I felt safe.

Hour 4 — 12:15 PM

First day was paperwork, trail maintenance, and camera checks. I labeled things the way they wanted: camera ID, time, species sighted, weather, notes. The first handful of camera cards showed the usual—turkeys, a doe with two fawns, a raccoon with more boldness than sense.

At 12:05, camera 7 (north ridge, near the old logging trail) recorded something I wrote down as ""unidentified, low silhouette, blurred."" I assumed wind, or a raccoon too close to the lens. On my way out I found no tracks leading up to the camera, only an imprint that looked like something had knelt to peer at the sensor. It was small, like a child's kneecap indentation in wet dirt. I snapped a photo with my phone and called it curiosity.

I was tired enough that night to sleep like a stone. The sky was bruised and the tower light blinked once, twice—my own little lighthouse out here.


---

Day 1 — The Small Things

Hour 24 — 08:00 AM

I started logging hourly, because the supervisor wanted ""detailed notes"" and because writing things down made them less like thoughts and more like facts. At dawn I walked the lower loop trail—miles of hemlocks, a thin creek, moss that felt like old velvet underfoot. The air smelled of wet wood and iron. A few yards in I found a string of footprints where a hiker's boots would be, but the prints were spaced too close together, like someone taking short, careful steps. The toes of the prints were blurred, as if the soles had been smeared.

I thought of the blurry silhouette from camera 7. I told myself that hikers get lost, leave odd marks, maybe there was a child with a pacifier on the trail. Practical explanations are comforting. I like practical.

Hour 30 — 02:00 PM

Trail camera 3 recorded the same doe at 13:58, but her eyes were—my chest tightens remembering this—reflective in a way camera sensors don't produce naturally. I enlarged the photo until the pixels broke: there was a ring of light in each eye, and within the rings something darker twitched. I put the camera card in my pocket and kept walking like I wasn't carrying a small proof of wrongness.

Hour 36 — 08:00 PM

At dinner I heard a sound like fingernails over a chalkboard: a staccato chorus of bird calls that didn't pattern into anything I'd learned to read. The birds are supposed to roost before dusk. Instead, they hung in the trees and watched. A robin landed on the railing outside my cabin window and cocked its head at me until I felt pinned.

When I went to check the tower light, the tower's ladder smelled of rot though I'd cleaned it that morning. The wind had a voice then—soft, long, almost like words if you tilted your head. I shut the tower hatch and pretended the voice hadn't spoken to me.


---

Day 2 — Signs

Hour 48 — 04:00 AM

I woke to static on the radio. Carter's voice had been clear when he'd left; now nothing but hiss and the long, low swell of distant birds. I thought I'd stand watch, so I brewed bad instant coffee and went to download camera cards.

Camera 7, north ridge: at 03:58, the sensor had tripped twenty-three times in two minutes. The footage was a smear of branches and something vertical, impossibly still, that moved only the way a shadow moves when it finds a light. Every time the sensor tripped, the birds on the frame turned their heads in unison, like a single being swiveling.

Hour 54 — 10:00 AM

I found, under the cedar at the trail's bend, a small nest of things: fur, feathers, and an old hiker's bandana knotted into nothing. The bandana hadn't been reported missing, as far as I knew. There were no footprints around it. The creek nearby had a patch of slick black that shone wet and oily and wasn't oil. It caught my flashlight and reflected something that wasn't mine.

I began to dream of paths I hadn't hiked, and when I woke the smell of rich earth would still be under my nails like a lie.


---

Day 3 — People Missing

Hour 72 — 09:30 AM

Report taken: local hikers, the Halvorson pair, last seen three days ago. I am the one who finds their pack—empty, zipped shut, shoulder straps splayed like folded wings—on the trail between markers 12 and 13. No footprints in, no footprints out. The pack had been set down carefully, as if placed on a chair, and someone had stuck a pinecone on top like a hat.

I logged the discovery, wrote my observations: ""pack intact, no human scent localized, single blade of red tape tied to zipper, no signs of struggle."" I called the county. The dispatcher asked if I'd search the area. I said yes and then walked until my legs wouldn't obey me.

Hour 80 — 05:00 PM

We found evidence—bits of clothing tucked into tree bark like offerings. One sock stretched over a low branch like a ragged flag. Later, when I copied the footage from camera 12 onto my laptop, I realized the last frames were of two small shapes moving through the underbrush and then—nothing. The camera had recorded air, then the lens smudged as if something leaned against it and breathed.

The sheriff came up the next morning and looked over the same footage with an expression I couldn't read. He said the right things—""We're ramping up the search""—then left his coffee on my counter and took the road back. The town doesn't like to stay long in places where birds hang and watch.


---

Day 4 — The Trails Shift

Hour 96 — 07:30 AM

I checked the perimeter with a GPS sweep: waypoints shift, coordinates jitter like a fevered pulse. The map said the service road should be two miles east; my truck said it was three. I walked the path to the service road in daylight and found myself facing a ridge I didn't recognize—an extra rise of land curving where there had been a low meadow. The trees rearranged themselves between my morning and the walk to the truck.

I started to tape the trails, flagging branches with orange tape. I came back hours later to find them in a neat row on the other side of the trail, as if the wood had taken offense.

Hour 108 — 08:45 PM

I heard laughter one night, distant and high, like someone in the trees playing at being human. It wasn't a child's laugh. It was the sound of something practicing a joke it's never heard the answer to. The wind—again that patient wind—carried phrases that could have been syllables. I roamed the property with a rifle more for company than protection and noticed that deer had begun to congregate near the cabin in the twilight, standing in a semicircle like an audience at a small, private execution.


---

Day 6 — The Unmaking

Hour 144 — 02:00 AM

Trail camera 4 recorded at 01:57: a woman, face pale, moving parallel to the camera. She raised an arm to scratch her cheek. Her shadow lagged a second behind her, not anchored to any consistent light source. In the next frame the shadow bent where her face was and stayed bent when she walked away. The camera's timestamp hiccuped then flashed 02:03, 02:03, 02:03 until the file corrupted.

I slept less. When I closed my eyes, the trees layered themselves into hallways and I walked them until sunlight found me in an unfamiliar place. The radios fed nothing. My satellite device pinged like a dying insect.

Hour 156 — 11:00 AM

There was a smell under the pine needles—sharp, bitter, metallic. I followed it and found a site where the undergrowth had been peeled aside and a shallow pit dug clean like a spoon's spoon. In the center lay something wrapped in canvas. When I unrolled it I thought—fingers. Limbs. Human, rearranged. Not cleanly: hands had been placed wrong and the face had been worked—stretched and pinned with tiny branches into an expression that didn't belong to the owner.

I vomited behind a log. The thing was not recent. The flies were old enough to be calm. I wrapped it back because what else could I do, and left a note in my log: ""Possible predator. Evidence of post-mortem manipulation. Reported to county.""


---

Day 7 — The Eyes

Hour 168 — 05:00 AM

I started to feel observed in the cabin in the way you feel observed when someone patiently watches a photograph develop. The glass of my window held reflections that weren't mine—fragmented faces like fish caught in a net. At night the deer would press their noses to the glass and breathe fog onto the panes, their eyes catching the light in a geometry that made me think of coins.

The birds had returned with feathers slick and unnatural, and they arranged themselves in patterns on branches: circles, triangles—symbols I couldn't place but felt in my teeth like cold.

Hour 180 — 09:00 PM

I took the truck, because the road had to still be there. I followed the painted mile markers that used to lead to the highway and drove until the needle on my fuel gauge began its slow drop. The road curved. A hundred yards of pavement bowed inward like a mouth and swallowed the sky as if the day had been folded.

When I stopped and got out, the truck's tailgate was covered in a thin film of something like ash. Footprints—too many—circled the vehicle, then stopped mid-step as if whoever made them had vanished. The GPS spun as if drunk. I could not tell if I'd gone in a straight line or right in a circle.


---

Day 8 — Fractures

Hour 192 — 02:30 AM

I began leaving notes for myself taped to the coffee maker, the bathroom mirror, the file cabinet. ""If you leave, go west."" ""Do not follow the birds."" ""Radio on channel 3."" I woke up to find my notes folded and tucked like little paper birds, noses pointing toward the woods.

At 02:11, camera 9 recorded something: dozens—no, hundreds—of small shapes moving silent as spores across the floor of the valley. In the center, one shape stood upright, impossibly tall and thin, like an outline traced with a finger. It tilted its head toward the camera, and though there was no face, the camera recorded a faint high tone, a note that matched the frequency of the ringing I now heard when my ears were full of sleep.

Hour 204 — 09:00 AM

A man from town named O'Leary came up, stubborn and red-faced, looking to retrieve his brother's hiking boots. He never made it back to the truck. He walked out with the boots and my radio picked up his last transmission: ""—found the trail—"" and then nothing but a metallic tearing, like wire being pulled through old cloth.

We found O'Leary later, collapsed at the base of a tree with his eyes open and his mouth arranged in a careful, surprised ""O."" His boots were on the other side of the ridge, propped against a stump. His trousers had been buttoned wrong; the seams ran at an angle. He had scratches, shallow and neat, on the inside of his wrist—as if he'd tried to tie his own hands together to keep from doing something or to keep someone else from doing it for him.


---

Day 10 — The Cabin

Hour 240 — 11:45 PM

At night the whispering learned names. It wouldn't call me by my given name—Ranger, Carter, the new one—but by smaller things: ""the one who keeps the lists,"" ""the one with the coffee,"" ""the one who counts."" When it whispered the last one, my name felt like a shirt turned inside out.

The animals got bolder. A fox crawled under my porch with something white and frayed in its mouth—paper. When it moved, the paper was my log pages stitched together into a crude shroud. The fox sat back and bared teeth that looked too human and then trotted away into thick, impossible black.

The cameras began to show impossible times: 13:00, 25:36, 00:00 in a freeze-frame that lasted until the file corrupted. Images doubled over themselves, like two mirrors angled until the corridor becomes an infinite well.

Hour 252 — 03:00 AM

I found, in the tower's logbook (the old one Carter left), an entry not in his handwriting. No, not an entry—an address written in ink that bled into the grain of the paper. The ink read: ""Follow the turning."" Underneath, someone had drawn a map with a spiral at the center and arrows pointing inward. I tore the page out and flushed it down the toilet in a small and futile ritual of refusal.


---

Final Entries — Collapse

Hour 264 — 01:30 AM

I cannot trust time anymore. I woke to find footsteps in the frost around the cabin—too many—and in the frost were letters pressed into the ground with a blunt instrument, a message for me or from me: stay. The letters were formed by small twigs pushed into the soil, meticulous and childish.

I burned those notes. I burned my old patrol jacket because it felt like it had been watching me in the closet. I thought flames would purge it, but the smell in the smoke was the forest's scent and it clung to my tongue like a memory.

Hour 270 — 02:45 AM

I put trail cameras in the trees outside and watched them on the laptop. The feeds arranged like a choir and each one told a slightly different story. One camera showed me as I sat there, watching the camera. Another showed an empty cabin. A third showed silhouettes standing at the tree line with folded arms. When I reversed the footage frame by frame, the silhouettes made the same slow nod, as if consenting.

At 03:00 the cameras began to synchronize. The feeds stacked: one frame, one movement, one breath. In the unified image, something walked through my yard and paused directly in front of the cabin window. It did not need a face; it had angles and the suggestion of a throat that swallowed the dark.

I tried the radio. Only static, and beneath it a low honest sound like someone turning a page. The satellite device chittered once and cut out. My phone began to lose bars like teeth falling out.

Hour 276 — 03:17 AM — Entry 042

I am typing this in manic fits. My hands remember handwriting more than keyboard. I don't know which direction the road goes. I don't know whether the tower light will still work by morning. The deer pressed their noses to the glass and tapped, patient as a clock.

If anyone reads this and hears the dispatcher ask if we searched thoroughly enough, tell them we didn't. Tell them the trees rearrange. Tell them that if you go looking, the park will show you a different face the next day and then the next until you no longer remember the day you left.

I don't want to go outside. I told myself not to leave the cabin tonight, but then I saw, through the trail camera feed, a boot print on the porch that wasn't there before: a small shoe, perfectly circular, no tread.

The pack had been set down carefully, as if placed on a chair, and someone had stuck a pinecone on top like a hat.

I logged the discovery, wrote my observations: ""pack intact, no human scent localized, single blade of red tape tied to zipper, no signs of struggle."" I called the county. The dispatcher asked if I'd search the area. I said yes and then walked until my legs wouldn't obey me.

Hour 80 — 05:00 PM

We found evidence—bits of clothing tucked into tree bark like offerings. One sock stretched over a low branch like a ragged flag. Later, when I copied the footage from camera 12 onto my laptop, I realized the last frames were of two small shapes moving through the underbrush and then—nothing. The camera had recorded air, then the lens smudged as if something leaned against it and breathed.

The sheriff came up the next morning and looked over the same footage with an expression I couldn't read. He said the right things—""We're ramping up the search""—then left his coffee on my counter and took the road back. The town doesn't like to stay long in places where birds hang and watch.

Day 4 — The Trails Shift

Hour 96 — 07:30 AM

I checked the perimeter with a GPS sweep: waypoints shift, coordinates jitter like a fevered pulse. The map said the service road should be two miles east; my truck said it was three. I walked the path to the service road in daylight and found myself facing a ridge I didn't recognize—an extra rise of land curving where there had been a low meadow. The trees rearranged themselves between my morning and the walk to the truck.

I started to tape the trails, flagging branches with orange tape. I came back hours later to find them in a neat row on the other side of the trail, as if the wood had taken offense.

Hour 108 — 08:45 PM

I heard laughter one night, distant and high, like someone in the trees playing at being human. It wasn't a child's laugh. It was the sound of something practicing a joke it's never heard the answer to. The wind—again that patient wind—carried phrases that could have been syllables. I roamed the property with a rifle more for company than protection and noticed that deer had begun to congregate near the cabin in the twilight, standing in a semicircle like an audience at a small, private execution.


---

Day 6 — The Unmaking

Hour 144 — 02:00 AM

Trail camera 4 recorded at 01:57: a woman, face pale, moving parallel to the camera. She raised an arm to scratch her cheek. Her shadow lagged a second behind her, not anchored to any consistent light source. In the next frame the shadow bent where her face was and stayed bent when she walked away. The camera's timestamp hiccuped then flashed 02:03, 02:03, 02:03 until the file corrupted.

I slept less. When I closed my eyes, the trees layered themselves into hallways and I walked them until sunlight found me in an unfamiliar place. The radios fed nothing. My satellite device pinged like a dying insect.

Hour 156 — 11:00 AM

There was a smell under the pine needles—sharp, bitter, metallic. I followed it and found a site where the undergrowth had been peeled aside and a shallow pit dug clean like a spoon's spoon. In the center lay something wrapped in canvas. When I unrolled it I thought—fingers. Limbs. Human, rearranged. Not cleanly: hands had been placed wrong and the face had been worked—stretched and pinned with tiny branches into an expression that didn't belong to the owner.

I vomited behind a log. The thing was not recent. The flies were old enough to be calm. I wrapped it back because what else could I do, and left a note in my log: ""Possible predator. Evidence of post-mortem manipulation. Reported to county.""


---

Day 7 — The Eyes

Hour 168 — 05:00 AM

I started to feel observed in the cabin in the way you feel observed when someone patiently watches a photograph develop. The glass of my window held reflections that weren't mine—fragmented faces like fish caught in a net. At night the deer would press their noses to the glass and breathe fog onto the panes, their eyes catching the light in a geometry that made me think of coins.

The birds had returned with feathers slick and unnatural, and they arranged themselves in patterns on branches: circles, triangles—symbols I couldn't place but felt in my teeth like cold.

Hour 180 — 09:00 PM

I took the truck, because the road had to still be there. I followed the painted mile markers that used to lead to the highway and drove until the needle on my fuel gauge began its slow drop. The road curved. A hundred yards of pavement bowed inward like a mouth and swallowed the sky as if the day had been folded.

When I stopped and got out, the truck's tailgate was covered in a thin film of something like ash. Footprints—too many—circled the vehicle, then stopped mid-step as if whoever made them had vanished. The GPS spun as if drunk. I could not tell if I'd gone in a straight line or right in a circle.


---

Day 8 — Fractures

Hour 192 — 02:30 AM

I began leaving notes for myself taped to the coffee maker, the bathroom mirror, the file cabinet. ""If you leave, go west."" ""Do not follow the birds."" ""Radio on channel 3."" I woke up to find my notes folded and tucked like little paper birds, noses pointing toward the woods.

At 02:11, camera 9 recorded something: dozens—no, hundreds—of small shapes moving silent as spores across the floor of the valley. In the center, one shape stood upright, impossibly tall and thin, like an outline traced with a finger. It tilted its head toward the camera, and though there was no face, the camera recorded a faint high tone, a note that matched the frequency of the ringing I now heard when my ears were full of sleep.

Hour 204 — 09:00 AM

A man from town named O'Leary came up, stubborn and red-faced, looking to retrieve his brother's hiking boots. He never made it back to the truck. He walked out with the boots and my radio picked up his last transmission: ""—found the trail—"" and then nothing but a metallic tearing, like wire being pulled through old cloth.

We found O'Leary later, collapsed at the base of a tree with his eyes open and his mouth arranged in a careful, surprised ""O."" His boots were on the other side of the ridge, propped against a stump. His trousers had been buttoned wrong; the seams ran at an angle. He had scratches, shallow and neat, on the inside of his wrist—as if he'd tried to tie his own hands together to keep from doing something or to keep someone else from doing it for him.


---

Day 10 — The Cabin

Hour 240 — 11:45 PM

At night the whispering learned names. It wouldn't call me by my given name—Ranger, Carter, the new one—but by smaller things: ""the one who keeps the lists,"" ""the one with the coffee,"" ""the one who counts."" When it whispered the last one, my name felt like a shirt turned inside out.

The animals got bolder. A fox crawled under my porch with something white and frayed in its mouth—paper. When it moved, the paper was my log pages stitched together into a crude shroud. The fox sat back and bared teeth that looked too human and then trotted away into thick, impossible black.

The cameras began to show impossible times: 13:00, 25:36, 00:00 in a freeze-frame that lasted until the file corrupted. Images doubled over themselves, like two mirrors angled until the corridor becomes an infinite well.

Hour 252 — 03:00 AM

I found, in the tower's logbook (the old one Carter left), an entry not in his handwriting. No, not an entry—an address written in ink that bled into the grain of the paper. The ink read: ""Follow the turning."" Underneath, someone had drawn a map with a spiral at the center and arrows pointing inward. I tore the page out and flushed it down the toilet in a small and futile ritual of refusal.


---

Final Entries — Collapse

Hour 264 — 01:30 AM

I cannot trust time anymore. I woke to find footsteps in the frost around the cabin—too many—and in the frost were letters pressed into the ground with a blunt instrument, a message for me or from me: stay. The letters were formed by small twigs pushed into the soil, meticulous and childish.

I burned those notes. I burned my old patrol jacket because it felt like it had been watching me in the closet. I thought flames would purge it, but the smell in the smoke was the forest's scent and it clung to my tongue like a memory.

Hour 270 — 02:45 AM

I put trail cameras in the trees outside and watched them on the laptop. The feeds arranged like a choir and each one told a slightly different story. One camera showed me as I sat there, watching the camera. Another showed an empty cabin. A third showed silhouettes standing at the tree line with folded arms. When I reversed the footage frame by frame, the silhouettes made the same slow nod, as if consenting.

At 03:00 the cameras began to synchronize. The feeds stacked: one frame, one movement, one breath. In the unified image, something walked through my yard and paused directly in front of the cabin window. It did not need a face; it had angles and the suggestion of a throat that swallowed the dark.

I tried the radio. Only static, and beneath it a low honest sound like someone turning a page. The satellite device chittered once and cut out. My phone began to lose bars like teeth falling out.

Hour 276 — 03:17 AM — Entry 042

I am typing this in manic fits. My hands remember handwriting more than keyboard. I don't know which direction the road goes. I don't know whether the tower light will still work by morning. The deer pressed their noses to the glass and tapped, patient as a clock.

If anyone reads this and hears the dispatcher ask if we searched thoroughly enough, tell them we didn't. Tell them the trees rearrange. Tell them that if you go looking, the park will show you a different face the next day and then the next until you no longer remember the day you left. Tell them the animals will watch and then they will learn to stand very still and take the same breath as you. Tell them the birds will sit in patterns and map you like a route.

I can hear something under the floorboards—no, not under them. Under the ground, like water moving through tight pipes. It's patient. It likes lists. It likes order. It likes counting.

I feel tired. Not the honest tired of a night's work, but the kind of tired that means something inside you has been used up and cannot be got back. The lights flicker. The whispering says, ""Come out. Come look. See what we made.""

I don't want to go outside. I told myself not to leave the cabin tonight, but then I saw, through the trail camera feed, a boot print on the porch that wasn't there before: a small shoe, perfectly circular, no tread. Something has been walking in loops around the cabin, rearranging everything into a neat theater where I am the audience that does not get up.

I have to keep typing because if the whispering stops when I'm writing then maybe the room is only listening. Maybe typing is a ward. Maybe not. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this is only a sequence of bad nights wound together by too much loneliness.

There's a sound now like a zipper at the edge of the world. The deer are quieter. The birds have left the branch outside the window and, in the sudden absence, I can hear the creak of a branch just outside the porch. It scratches at the railing in a slow deliberate way, like someone testing a door.

If they ask what happened, tell them I tried to mark the trails. Tell them I put cameras on poles and signs that said ""NO TRESPASSING"" and ""CHRONICLE"" and I put my name on them. Tell them I did all the small things right. Tell them I logged everything. Tell them I typed, because typing seems like something they cannot take from me—this small human act, this list of hours and events.

If anyone is coming, do not follow the birds. Do not go after shadows that move on their own. If you must go, take a compass and a candle and remember that the road bends in on itself like an ear folded over. Keep counting your steps. Count them out loud. If you sound like a person with a plan, the forest will try to learn that plan and mimic it until you're so tired you cannot tell your own footsteps from a lie.

There's a tapping now against the window, like fingernails. Not nails—twigs. It spells something with rhythm: tap-tap—tap—tap. I can't read it. I don't want to. I told myself I'd never bring anyone into a place that listens.

My hands won't stop shaking. I can't feel whether the keys move because my fingertips are numb. The whispering got a syllable right then and said my name as if it had rehearsed it in front of a mirror: ""—Car—""

It doesn't know my name the way I do. It knows the shape of it.

I hear a small laugh, like a child trying on an adult's laugh and failing.

I thought I could keep the list. I thought I could make a map that would not be rewritten. I thought logs were talismans.

The door is opening now. The latch moves slow, like the first breath of a sleeper. The hinge remembers the oil and the memory of the metal gives it a little wheeze and then a scent—wet pine and iron and the thing they use to stitch things together. I can hear feet on the porch. They step in a rhythm that is not one I have taught them.

If I stop typing, assume they have found me. If you read this after, and you come for me, leave a note on the porch and back away. Leave a ring of stones and a circle of tape. The forest likes to learn patterns. It will learn which way you move.

There's a face at the window now, flat and wrong in the way things that are not meant for faces are wrong. It doesn't blink. It doesn't need to.

They're saying something—no, it's not words. It's a pattern of breaths that could be translated into words if you had the patience.",1,1767030113.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I can see, feel, hear, and sometimes smell or taste whatever they are doing for a short period of time. 

The thing is that i am fully awake whenever this happens so sometimes i get confused because i can hear rain drop but it’s sunny outside and i ask my husband or anybody near me they can hear it. Then when i concentrate on it i can immerse on the other body that i am in. 

It’s very random as well and i don’t even know if it was happening in our time. 

There was one time where i was in a morning meeting in a boardroom and suddenly i can smell a strong scent of coffee and sounds of waves crashing. I tried to ignore it but then suddenly my visions of what is happening in front of me is blending to what is happening in the boardroom. My boss was talking to us and i can see people wearing suits and hats like back in the days. They were walking past behind him. When i concentrated, i was in a body of a man wearing cream colored suit and tie with a coffee in front of me, he was sitting on a balcony with a view near a beach. I was seeing it from his eyes the it’s gone. 

Another time, i was going to sleep but i get the feeling of being chased like my anxiety is so high. Then i felt a tugging feeling then it felt like i was shot out of my body in high speed and landed on a woman. I landed on her so hard that it knocked her back. It was night and we are in a middle of a forrest i can still remember her running and panting it was fucked up but whenever she looked back there was nothing there and then she screamed and it ended. 

The most recent one happened just this morning. I haven’t been in Philippines for a looooong time. So i was surprised when i woke up early today and for some reason i am in a man’s body and it’s night time. I know i am still on my bed but i can see what he is doing. The experience was so vivid that the food cart he was standing next to has some cut up news paper and i can read some words on it. He was eating something on the first food cart he went to and the next food cart was selling powdered donuts. Mind you, i didn’t know if this is a thing. I’ve never seen any food cart that sells powdered donuts back when i was living there. There were 3 flavors and he ordered a milk powdered donut. When he bit into it, i could taste and smell it. I can feel the powder dropping everywhere. 

Then after finishing the donut, the vision was gone. I was telling my husband the story when he woke up. I didn’t leave my bed by the way. I was telling him the story of how i tasted the donut. I lifted my hand on my face then i realized i can smell milk powder on my hands. 

I asked him to smell it and he said he can smell it too.

That was the first text message I got that morning.

It came from an unknown number. No name. No emoji. No follow-up. Just those five words, all caps, like the sender was afraid of being overheard even through a phone.

For a few seconds, I sat up in bed, staring at the screen while my alarm continued to chirp beside me. The early light filtering through my blinds gave my room its usual harmless look: laundry on the chair, posters peeling at the corners, my backpack slumped against the wall. Everything normal. Everything safe.

I checked the time. 6:14 a.m.

I laughed, one sharp breath through my nose. 

A prank. 

Spam. 

It was just someone messing with me. My friends thought it was funny to send creepy stuff sometimes, especially before exams.

Still, my thumb hovered over the keyboard longer than it should have.

*Who the fuck is this?* I typed.

The message showed as delivered. No response.

I tossed the phone onto my bed and stood up, stretching. I had school. A math test. A bus to catch. The real world didn’t pause for anonymous texts.

As I brushed my teeth, I kept glancing at my reflection, half-expecting to see something different. Someone standing behind me. A shadow that didn’t belong to me.

Nothing.

By the time I was dressed, the message had faded into the background noise of my mind—unsettling, but distant. I grabbed my phone again as I headed downstairs.

Another message had come in.

**They know you saw the first one.**

My stomach dropped so suddenly it felt like I’d missed a step on the stairs.

“Mom?” I called, my voice cracking in a way I didn’t like.

“In the kitchen,” she answered, cheerful, unaware.

I stood frozen halfway down the stairs, staring at the screen. My phone buzzed again.

**You have three minutes.**

“Three minutes for what?” I whispered.

I typed again, hands shaking now. *Who are they?*

The response came instantly.

**Not who. What.**

A chill crept up my arms. I suddenly became aware of every sound in the house: the hum of the refrigerator, the tick of the clock, my mom humming softly to herself.

I went into the kitchen, trying to act normal. My mom slid a plate of toast toward me.

“You look pale,” she said. “Did you sleep?”

“Yeah,” I lied.

My phone buzzed on the counter.

**Two minutes.**

I swallowed hard. “Mom… did you get any weird messages this morning?”

She frowned. “No. Why?”

Another buzz.

**They’re closer than you think.**

My chest tightened. “I—I think someone’s messing with me.”

My mom sighed, already reaching for her coffee. 

“Sweetheart, if it’s a prank, ignore it. You’ll miss your bus.”

The phone vibrated again.

**One minute.**

I felt lightheaded. “Mom, I think we should—”

The lights flickered.

Just once. Quick. Like a blink.

My mom looked up. “Probably the storm last night.”

The phone buzzed again.

**Thirty seconds. Closet. Bathroom. Anywhere without windows. Do NOT be seen.**

My heart slammed against my ribs. This was too specific. Too urgent.

I grabbed my phone and backed away from the counter. 

“Mom, please, we need to go somewhere else in the house.”

She stared at me, confused now. “What’s going on?”

The lights flickered again—longer this time.

My phone buzzed.

**They’re here.**

A sound came from outside.

Not a knock.

Not footsteps.

A low, dragging scrape, like something heavy being pulled across concrete.

My mom turned toward the front door. 

“Did someone—”

“Don’t open it,” I said, louder than I meant to.

She froze. “What?”

The scrape came again. Closer. Accompanied by something else now—a faint clicking, irregular, like nails tapping out of sync.

My phone buzzed nonstop, messages stacking faster than I could read.

**DO NOT LET THEM SEE YOU**

**THEY MIMIC**

**HIDE NOW**

The doorbell rang.

It wasn’t the cheerful chime we’d always had. It was distorted, buzzing too long, like someone was leaning on it.

“Mom,” I whispered, tears burning my eyes. “Please.”

She took a step back from the door.

The doorbell stopped.

Silence.

Then a voice came from the other side.

“Hello?” it called.

It sounded exactly like my mom.

She gasped. I felt something inside me snap, a cold understanding settling in.

The voice spoke again. “It’s me. I forgot my keys.”

My mom covered her mouth with her hand.

The phone buzzed once more.

**That is not her.**

The handle on the door slowly began to turn.

I grabbed my mom’s wrist and pulled her toward the hallway. We ran, slipping on the tile, my heart pounding so loud I was sure *it* could hear us.

Behind us, the front door creaked open.

Footsteps entered the house.

Slow. Careful.

Learning.

We dove into the bathroom and slammed the door, locking it just as something brushed against the hallway wall. I dragged my mom into the bathtub and yanked the shower curtain closed, then turned off the lights.

We huddled there in the dark, barely breathing.

The footsteps moved closer.

The bathroom door handle jiggled.

Then a voice—my voice—spoke softly from just outside.

“I know you’re scared. It’s okay. You can come out now.”

My mom clutched my arm so hard it hurt.

The handle stopped moving.

Silence stretched, heavy and unbearable.

Minutes passed. Or hours. I couldn’t tell.

My phone buzzed faintly in my hand.

**Good. Stay still. They lose interest if they can’t confirm you.**

I typed with trembling fingers. *What are they?*

The response came slower this time.

**We don’t know. They appear, they copy, they replace. We only know how to survive them.**

Another message followed.

**You weren’t the first one we warned.**

A sudden crash came from the living room—the sound of something being knocked over, followed by that same dragging scrape.

Then footsteps moved toward the back door.

The house fell quiet again.

We stayed hidden until the sun was fully up, until my phone battery dipped into the red, until the fear dulled enough for exhaustion to take over.

Eventually, we heard sirens outside. Neighbors gathering. Someone shouting about a break-in.

The police said there was no sign of forced entry.

They said nothing was missing.

They said maybe someone had just walked into the wrong house.

That night, after everything settled, after my mom finally fell asleep on the couch beside me, I plugged in my phone and scrolled back through the messages.

The number was gone.

Not deleted.

Gone.

No sender. No record. Like it had never existed.

Except for one final message, timestamped hours after the others.

**We’ll text again if you survive tomorrow.**

I locked my phone and stared at the dark window across the room.

Outside, someone was standing on the sidewalk.

Watching the house.

Smiling with my face.

1pysjs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/4tran4/comments/1pysjs8/genuinely_doubtful_of_transitioning/,Genuinely doubtful of transitioning,"Note: I found this sub and while I don't understand all of its slangery/terms yet, I find it interesting and it's different to the ""you go girly girllll"" attitude of r/MtF or r/trans, yet it isn't the ""DON'T JOIN THE T CABAL"" sentimient of r/detrans...so I wanted to read opinions from here. I'm AMAB 25 yold.

Context: From the very start of 2024 I began HRT as dysphoria was unbeareable and the end result wasn't so good. I rushed it, didn't have psych support nor other solid social support, felt unsure about pronouns, unsure about changes, and as I have heavy health anxiety, I had several panic attacks regarding hormone fluctuations, intensified by other habits like too much coffee/alcohol, debts, job instability, and my general isolation and baseline anxiety levels...anyways, I ended up dropping HRT for good near end of that year, so I was like 10 months on it.

Now in 2025 during most of the first half of the year I was in a kind of ""mourning"" phase of my transness. I thought I ""just idealized"" everything, that hormones clearly weren't for me, that I was just escaping something (""masculinity"" I guess), and that I should forget it all. But it was all still there, haunting me.

Yet during the second half of 2025, something weird happened...in this second half I decided to get my shit together and start planning my re-trooning. I finally got a job recently to be able to cover cost of things like buying new clothes and voice training...YET...part of me getting my shit together was trying to go back socializing even if it meant boymoding around not telling anyone (the only obvious sign of transitioning is my already long hair but men have long hair too so whatever), and something particular happened here...I enjoyed a lot the ""gendered"" aspect of many social situations I put myself during this, SPECIALLY towards women. Like, I really enjoyed being ""the dude"" that talked to women, instead of another girl talking to another girl. Like I found enjoyment in the masculine role in that interaction, and mind you it wasn't any kind of sexual/romantic intention. Just normal chat and get to know the other in an event or whatever place.

This ""reconnection"" to the male role has happened in other small aspects I thought I'd never regain after all the intense dysphoria I suffered for around 1.5 years (because before, my dysphoria went unnoticed and generally mild)...so I just don't know what to do...should I just rep and try to be a man for some time (including cutting my hair that took so much to grow out) to see if i can find enjoyment; or is it futile as dysphoria will come back stronger than ever in the future, so I should transition as it was my intention all along these last years?

I know some people here are intensely dysphoric and really eager transition badly like no other thing, I hope you don't see me as tucute, I'm not into idpol views of T, just really in kind of crossroads place because I genuinely don't know what path of life makes sense anymore...thx.",2,1767029820.0,4tran4,3,0.67,False
1pysjre,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1pysjre/gagged_grinded_legally_screwed/,"Gagged, Grinded, & Legally Screwed","They say bad things come in threes.

The cease-and-desist letter arrived in threes.

First by certified mail.

Then by Email.

And last by Grinded app notification from user SuitedDaddy4Justice.

Their bio? *Here 4 legal penetration. 😈⚖️*

They gave it to him straight.

Well.

As straight as anything involving Grinded could be. 

*""Cease immediately or prepare to be legally raw-dogged harder than a twink at his first Pride.""*

Austin Coyle, 32, part-time barista and full-time mistake, read it while shoveling cold leftovers into his mouth, surrounded by empty soda cans and a cat named Peanut Bottom, whose judgmental glare screamed Fox News and Fancy Feast. 

*“We are prepared to pursue aggressive legal action regarding the malicious and defamatory portrayal of our client’s revolutionary social platform within your literary hate crime.”*

It was signed by The Law Offices of Grinded LLC, whose company motto was, *“Slide into Our DMs... in Court.”*

Austin blinked at the letter like a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming midlife crisis.

His questionable fame began with *Grinded & Bound: The Paranormal Hookup Files*, a novella best described as if Stephen King ghostwrote an episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race while drunk on Fireball.

The plot? A cursed dating app that makes hookups go supernaturally sideways.

It quickly became a cult hit online. Comments included:

“This healed me in ways therapy couldn’t.”

“Is the ghost real or just a metaphor for my last situationship? Either way, hot.”

“This is what happens when gay men aren’t supervised by publishing houses.”

""This awakened something in me that probably should have stayed asleep.""

“I screamed. I cried. I got turned on.”

But apparently, not everyone was thrilled with Austin's literary masterpiece. Some people, namely, a corporate team with unlimited legal ammo and possibly a ritual blood oath with Verizon, were Big Mad.

So Austin, of course, did what any desperate millennial does when faced with legal annihilation and $8.73 in his checking account.

He went to Reddit.

Specifically, r/legaladvice.

Even more specifically, he hired a guy from there named Brad.

Yes, *Brad.*

They arranged to meet at a Starbucks.

Brad arrived ten minutes late, wearing cargo shorts and carrying a binder labeled *LAW STUFF.*

“So like,” Brad began, “fair use is when something’s fair. Like, if it’s funny, it’s chill. That's literally the law.”

Austin stared at him like he’d just offered legal advice via Ouija board and crystal ball consultation.

“Did you actually go to law school?”

""I mean... I went to Abraham Lincoln University Online, yeah. It's totally accredited. I think.”

Brad then claimed to have once ""helped a YouTuber not get sued by Chuck E. Cheese for making a horror movie in the ball pit.""

""Plus,"" he added, ""I once sued myself for character defamation. I lost. But I learned a lot.""

Austin's soul left his body, took a walk around the block while smoking a cigarette, and reluctantly returned.

Court was held in a stuffy downtown building that smelled like old coffee, crushed dreams, and the faint aroma of judicial disappointment. The courtroom was packed. Half with legal observers who clearly had nothing better to do, half with fans in cosplay holding signs that read: 

“I BELIEVE IN GHOST DICK JUSTICE”

“HAUNT ME, DADDY”

“LEAVE AUSTIN ALONE!”

The prosecution was led by a man so devoid of joy he looked like he strangled puppies for cardio. His tie was covered in tiny gavels, his suit was the color of despair, and his facial expression suggested he'd never experienced physical affection, basic human kindness, or a single gram of serotonin.

His soul had clearly been repossessed by Sallie Mae, resold to corporate overlords, and was now being rented back to him at a premium rate.

The judge, a 60-something woman with cat-eye eyeglasses and deep “I don’t have time for this shit” energy, eyed the crowd, sighed, and motioned for opening statements.

Prosecutor Gavel Tie came in hard, loud, and painfully dry. 

“Your Honor,” he bellowed, “the defendant has maliciously portrayed my client’s innovative dating platform as, and I quote, ‘a cursed hellscape where horny meets haunted and daddy issues go to reincarnate.’”

“Furthermore,” Gavel Tie barked, “his book suggests users are engaging in necro-communication via unsolicited ectoplasmic sexts.”

Austin whispered to Brad, “To be fair, that’s still more reliable than their app’s message function.”

Brad nodded and scribbled, “Ghosts not likely to ghost?”

“And let’s not forget,” Gavel Tie thundered, “his depiction of our app’s users as, again, quoting directly, ‘men who list masc4masc but still haunt their ex’s Netflix login.’”

Austin shrugged. “Some subscriptions never end.” 

“Mr. Coyle,” the prosecutor asked, pacing like an angry Karen demanding to speak to the manager, “are you aware that parody requires actual comedic intent?”

“I was until I read this lawsuit. Now I’m not sure anyone here knows what comedy is.” 

“Did you describe Grinded as ‘Tinder’s gay, gothic twin with less functionality and a Beetlejuice addiction’?”

“Yes. I’ve seen ant farms with fewer bugs than their app.” 

“Why write something so indecent?”

""Because healing’s expensive, shame is free, and my mental breakdowns have surprisingly good pacing.""

Finally, with his shirt freshly ironed and soul slightly wrinkled, Austin stood and addressed the court, channeling every courtroom drama he'd ever binge-watched on Netflix. 

“Your Honor, I didn’t write this story to defame anyone. I wrote it because I was sad, horny, and accidentally downloaded a haunted dating app while drunk.” 

He continued. “It’s not about Grinded, really. It’s about healing. About wanting to haunt your ex but not being able to afford a medium.”

Austin looked around the courtroom.

“I never set out to hurt their brand. Honestly, I improved it. Before my story, they were just another bug-ridden, soul-sucking hookup app. Now? They’ve got lore. They’ve got plot. They’ve got *ghost-flavored dick.”*

He paused for dramatic effect.

“And let the record show: I did not invent the haunted app rumors. I just wrote what their users were already screaming in one-star reviews.”

He handed a printed review to the judge that read, “Matched with my ex. He’s dead. App crashed. Ghosted... again.”

Austin nodded triumphantly. ""Your Honor, that's not libel. That's customer dissatisfaction. And customers don't lie. They're just dead inside. Sometimes literally.""

The jury deliberated for exactly eight minutes. Just enough time to order a round of lattes, start a group chat called ""Grinded Truthers,"" and collectively decide that this was the most entertainment they'd had since Tiger King.

They returned with the verdict.

“Not guilty on all counts. Also, when’s the movie adaptation?”

The judge banged her gavel. “Case dismissed. Mr. Coyle, you’re free to go. Try not to piss off Apple next time.”

Austin turned to Brad. They fist bumped like two dudes who had just successfully won against Satan using nothing but vibes and a free trial of Grammarly Premium.

The real victory though?

Austin's book sales skyrocketed in the following weeks. Turns out, being legally screwed doesn’t always leave you on your knees.

Sometimes, you finish with a happy ending instead. ",0,1767029818.0,stories,0,0.5,False

Would love to hear some of you guys opinions or help fixing my built in Siemsens coffee machine. A while ago we noticed that the machine would make any cappuccino’s or any other drink with milk in it. The machine requires an add on filled with milk which it will use to make foam or any other product with it. After a couple of weeks the machine wouldn’t give normal coffee either or any kind of other drinks. I sadly ain’t that handy with such machines so I can’t seem to figure out what is wrong.

I can’t find any ‘good’ tutorials online on how to check or disassemble the machine part by part. Does anybody have a clue what could be wrong or has experience whit this kind of coffee machine? I already checked some parts internally but still no clue. Anybody has a clue what could be wrong or which part is defect?",1,1767029423.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

My shift started at 6 P.M. and ended at 1 A.M. The place was usually crowded, and we served beer alongside the games. It wasn’t just an arcade—it was somewhere people drank, played, and stayed longer than they should have.

I took the job because it paid better than average. I only worked there for six months before I had to leave for mandatory military service in my country. At the time, I didn’t think much about what happened during my last weeks there. By the time my service ended two years later, the memory had faded.

It wasn’t until this winter that it came back to me.

And I realized how glad I was that I never broke the rule.

The arcade officially closed at 1 A.M., but the owner usually left around 11. After that, the entire place was mine. Most nights were quiet. People left early. No one came in that late.

That night was different.

At 12:30 A.M., three drunk men walked in.

It wasn’t common, but it happened. They were well-dressed, expensive coats, expensive watches, already slurring their words.

“Room for three,” one of them said.

I smiled and led them to the largest room. Not because they asked—because I didn’t want trouble.

They laughed loudly as I signed them in. I remember clearly: three people.

I checked the system to make sure the game had started. That mattered. We were paid per person, not per room.

I remember thinking, *Great. I’m getting off late.*

I messaged a friend to let them know, brewed myself a cup of coffee, and finished cleaning. By the time I closed the gate, the music was playing, and the place felt empty again.

That’s when I went outside for a smoke.

I had been gone for less than a minute.

I could still hear the game through the walls when I stepped outside. The music didn’t stop. No doors opened. No one passed me.

When I came back inside, nothing felt different.

Except there were only two of them standing at the counter.

One of the men looked at me and asked,

“Have you seen our other friend?”

I paused.

There were supposed to be three of them.

Then one of the others started calling his phone.

We all heard it ringing.

From inside one of the empty rooms.

 

I found his phone in the room. It was on the couch, still vibrating.  
His tie was on the floor.

Other than that, the room was clean.

I handed both to one of them. At the time, I wasn’t scared. I was annoyed. I already knew I’d be getting off work much later than planned.

They didn’t look annoyed.

One of them was on the phone, speaking quietly. When he hung up, he asked if I could talk to her.

I took the phone.

She sounded desperate.

“Are you really the manager?” she asked. “This isn’t a joke, right?”

I told her I worked there.

She explained that her husband—fiancé, I wasn’t sure—had a habit of falling asleep anywhere when he was drunk. She asked me to look for him, just to make sure he was okay.

It was winter. Letting someone pass out somewhere cold wasn’t a good idea.

I told her I would check.

By then, it was almost 2 A.M. I had already cleaned the place and locked the front door. The only exit still open was the back door, which led to the elevators.

Anyone leaving that way would have been caught on camera.

The problem was, I didn’t know the access code.

I hesitated, then called the owner.

He picked up immediately.

He sounded irritated, like I’d woken him up, but after I explained the situation, he gave me the code.

Before hanging up, he said one thing very clearly.

“You can check the cameras,” he said. “But do not go into the server room.”

I didn’t argue. I was too tired to care about the server room.

I pulled up the footage.

On the screen, I saw myself playing on my phone before stepping into the smoking room. Less than a minute later, the door to the arcade opened.

The missing man stepped out.

He walked straight toward the camera—then turned away at the last second, moving out of view.

Like he knew exactly where the blind spot was.

Less than a minute later, the other two left their room and came to the counter.

That was it.

No footage of him leaving the building.

I called the building’s night guard. He was still on duty and swore he hadn’t seen anyone leave. He said he’d been sitting by the elevators the whole time, watching a game on his phone.

I had to close the arcade. Even if someone was missing, I still had to finish the register and lock the place.

I took one of their phone numbers and told them I’d call if I found their friend. They nodded and left.

After they were gone, the arcade went completely quiet.

The only sound I could hear came from behind the walls.

From the direction of the server room.

The night guard came down a few minutes later and asked if I could help him check the rest of the building. It was a ten-story building, and checking it alone would take too long.

We locked both the front and back doors and started from the top floor, working our way down, checking stairwells and hallways in case the guy had passed out somewhere.

While we walked, I told him about the phone and the tie I’d found.

He chuckled, like it wasn’t a big deal.

“You said you watched the footage,” he said. “Then how come you never saw him go into another room?”

“I was outside smoking,” I said. “They were already staying past closing.”

He smiled.

“Maybe he was trying to send a signal,” he said. “You sure they were getting along?”

That made me pause.

This was just an arcade. Why would anything else be going on?

I laughed it off.

“Nice try,” I said. “I even spoke to his girlfriend.”

He stopped walking for a second, then smiled again.

“How do you know she was his girlfriend?” he asked. “What if they wanted you to call her? Just to create an alibi?”

By the time he said that, we had reached the ground floor.

We still hadn’t found him.

“That’s it,” I said. “I’m calling it.”

The guard nodded.

“Did you know,” he said casually, “that before the arcade moved in, there was another floor below this one?”

I looked at him.

“There’s a hidden floor,” he continued. “You can access it through the server room.”

I was exhausted. It was almost 2:30 A.M.

“Forget it,” I said. “You’re just trying to scare me.”

He laughed.

“Want to check the server room?” I asked.

He shook his head.

“Trust me,” he said. “He’s not down there.”

He turned off the hallway lights.

The floor went dark, except for the red glow of the elevator numbers and a faint flickering light leaking out from under the server room door.

Before I could say anything, the elevator dinged.

The doors opened.

The guard smiled.

“Let’s go,” he said. “If he were in the server room, the morning shift would find him.”

“The morning shift?” I asked.

“Yeah,” he said. “They’re professionals.”

I didn’t touch the server room door.

I stepped into the elevator instead.

A few days later, I quit the job.

No one ever called me back about the missing man.

But even now, ten years later, I still remember the light coming from the server room.

No one was supposed to be in there.

So I still wonder—

We’ve been friends for five years or so. They’re great and we share a lot of similar interests. My wife and the woman from the other couple started dating about a month ago and have slept together and told each other that they love each other. Myself and the man in the other couple are both figuring out how this situation works. We are all reading the ethical slut as recommended by this subreddit. 

I am taking the woman from the other couple out on a casual date to get coffee next weekend, and the man from the other couple is taking my wife to hangout and see a scary movie, which is a common interest of theirs. 

Prior to this I think it’s fair to say that there were some mild crushes in the group but nothing openly communicated until now. 

Currently we are interested in taking one another on dates in various “dyads” to use the poly terminology, and getting to know one another on an emotional level. We have all held hands and flirted in front of one another but other than the girls we have not kissed or taken things to a more physical level. 

I guess what I’m struggling with is, I don’t want to feel like I’m intruding on my wife’s relationship with this woman by saying her as well. I have expressed this concern to her as well and she has said repeatedly she really is interested in me and myself either separately or together. 

How do we do this successfully? Are the odds okay that this could be something that works? What are the potential pitfalls we could encounter here? I know that being friends raises the stakes, but it also does make me feel safer and more secure, and I have really strong connections with these people. 

I guess I’m looking to hear some success stories, and also just, “wisdom” for making this work (hopefully) long term. And if it doesn’t work out I’d really like to still have these friendships going forward because I love these people very much. ",1,1767029343.0,polyamory,4,0.67,False

\- Hovering around the couch, watching TV, without actually sitting down

\- Finding WW2 ""really interesting""

1pys9fw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pys9fw,Chapter 3 of Robb Walsh’s The Tex-Mex Cookbook — Chili con Carne,"#THE CHILI JOINTS AND THE CHILI QUEENS

THE SLOW-SIMMERED, COARSELY GROUND BEEF in the bowl before me has a healthy dose of chili powder and no beans, identifying it as true Texas-style chili. The meat is tender, and there’s a strong aroma of cumin. I have to admit that it’s an excellent bowl of chili. Which is kind of a surprise in a chain like Chili’s.

The Chili’s location in Bastrop, where I am eating this bowl of Texas red, has decorated its walls with chili cook-off posters and snapshots from chili cook-offs all over Texas. Every Chili’s I’ve ever seen is decorated exactly the same way. It’s a cookie-cutter format, but sadly, it’s about all that’s left of the American chili joint.

Opened by former cowboy cooks and other such dubious chefs, ramshackle chili joints once served up a bowl of red and a plate of crackers for a nickel. By the early part of the twentieth century, they were found all across the Midwest. Some variation on chili con carne was served in restaurants across the United States.

Chili con carne’s fame began to spread across the country after the Columbian Exhibition of 1893 in Chicago. The Texas exhibit at this “world’s fair” recreated a typical San Antonio chili stand and sold authentic Texas chili con carne to fair-goers. Within a few years, chili stands and chili joints began popping up all over the United States, and canned chili became a common item in food stores.

In most of the rest of the country, chili has one purpose — it is a hearty one-dish meal. But in Texas, chili has a wide variety of uses. It can be used straight or diluted as a sauce. It’s a popular topping for tamales. To make it into a meal, you combine it with beans, tamales, tortillas, enchiladas, scrambled eggs, or any number of other things. Texans don’t have anything against eating beans with their chili. They just have a lot of other ways to eat it.

“Chili con carne evolved from enchilada sauce,” suggests Raul Molina, of the Molina’s restaurant chain in Houston. Chile colorado, which literally means “red chile” in Spanish, was also the name given to red chile sauces and to red chile sauces with meat, such as the dish that came to be called chili con carne. At first there was little or no difference between red chile sauce and “chili.” 

But as beef became cheaper, cowboys and chuckwagon cooks turned the red chile enchilada sauce into a meat-heavy main dish.

The invention of chili powder around 1900 made the dish very easy to prepare. The Texas food companies that sold chili powders and canned chili advertised “authentic Mexican” flavor, and so most Americans assumed that chili con carne was of Mexican origin. All the food prepared and sold by the Spanish-speaking citizens of San Antonio was called Mexican food — with good reason.

With some notable exceptions, Texas-Mexican food at the time was more or less identical to the *norteño* food of northern Mexico’s ranching region. This was the only part of Mexico most Texans knew. Few at the time realized Mexico City had an entirely different idea of Mexican cuisine.

In the late 1800s, the Mexico City elite considered beans, chiles, and corn products such as tortillas and tamales to be low-class street foods. Educated Mexicans have a special contempt for Tex-Mex chili con carne, which is defined in the *Diccionario de Mejicanismos* as a “*detestable comida que con el falso titulo de mejicana*” — that is, a detestable food falsely labeled Mexican. Clearly, something about the flavor of chili con carne was uniquely un-Mexican.

SOME ARGUE THAT THE EXOTIC TASTE OF Tex-Mex can be traced to the Canary Islands. In March 1731, fifteen families from the Canary Islands arrived in the struggling settlement of Bexar, as San Antonio was then known.

In mission-era San Antonio, Spanish soldiers and citizens were barred from fraternizing with the mission Indians. (Earlier missions in East Texas had failed because so many Indians died from European diseases.) Since Indians made up nearly the entire population of the missions, the Spanish community was completely lacking in social and commercial opportunities. 

The settlement lacked colonists, but few Spaniards were interested in relocating to such a wilderness. So the government of Spain recruited families of colonists from the Canary Islands, a Spanish possession off the coast of Africa where land was in short supply. To entice the recruits, the Spanish crown offered male islanders who relocated the noble title hidalgo. The islanders expected to form the aristocracy of the new land called Texas, but when they got there, they were disappointed to discover that there was no peasant class to rule over, since the Mission Indians were kept segregated from the Spanish soldiers and citizens.

The Canary Islanders and their offspring supplied the community with most of its leaders for many years. The Canary Islanders’ influence on San Antonio culture continues to this day — especially when it comes to food.

It has been said that the Canary Islanders brought cumin (*comino*) to Texas. But shipping lists of items sent to the San Antonio missions indicate that cumin was among the spices already available to the Franciscans. If the Canary Islanders didn’t actually introduce cumin to San Antonio, they did bring with them from North Africa a taste for cumin in amounts that most Spaniards would find overwhelming.

The Canary Islands were originally inhabited by the Guanche, a Berber people who came from Morocco. According to the American Spice Trade Association, the “lavish use of spices” characterizes Berber foods, and the cuisine’s “flavor imprint” is made up of “cumin, coriander, saffron, chiles, ginger, cinnamon and paprika.” The Canary Island women reportedly made a stew with cumin, chile peppers, wild onions, and the available herbs. These were cooked outdoors in copper kettles in the village plaza and shared with soldiers and passersby at sundown.

The Canary Islanders’ taste for cumin-heavy seasoning and their tradition of outdoor socializing after dinner may be where the San Antonio chili stand tradition began. In the July 1927 issue of *Frontier Times* magazines, San Antonio commissioner Frank H. Bushwick talked about the chili queens and their original location in Military Plaza, where they worked before being moved to Market Square in 1887. “The chili stand and chili queens are peculiarities … of the Alamo City. They started away back there when the Spanish army camped on the plaza,” Bushwick said.

“Chili stands, that used to come out with the stars and fringe the horizon of Military Plaza, were an institution that was distinctively San Antonian,” wrote James P. Newcomb in 1901. “The fame of the Chili Queen became worldwide.” The chili stands shared the public squares with vegetable vendors. The vendors arrived before dawn and sold their wares until just after noon. The chili queens, who often worked as laundry women by day, set up their food stalls in the evening. 

In the beginning the food vendors simply ladled their stews from cazuelas or clay pots. But by the late 1800s an elaborate sort of portable restaurant had evolved. Three ten-foot planks were propped on sawhorses in the shape of a J, then covered with red-and-white-checkered oilcloth, explained occasional San Antonio resident William Sydney Porter, better known as O. Henry. The tables were decorated with vases of paper flowers and lit by laundry lamps. Patrons could add seasonings from red clay condiment dishes that contained oregano and chopped onions, among other things. In O. Henry’s day, a bowl of chili with bread and water sold for ten cents.

In his bizarre tale “The Enchanted Kiss,” O. Henry describes the “delectable chile-con-carne … composed of delicate meats minced with aromatic herbs and the poignant chile colorado — a compound full of singular savor and a fiery zest …”

Many chili queens went on to open small cafés in the front rooms of their homes. These impromptu eateries were known as *fondas*. “Sadie, the acknowledged ‘queen’ of all ‘queens’ on account of her beauty, her vivacity and her aptitude at repartee, has opened up a fonda, taken unto herself a husband and is taking life quietly and easy,” reported the San Antonio *Daily Express* in 1894.

San Antonio’s Mexican Quarter, or El Laredito, as it was known, wasn’t just a place to eat chili, it was the most exciting late-night scene in the state of Texas. Some favorite fondas were on the edge of the city’s red light district. About a place called Madame Garza’s, San Antonio author Charles Ramsdell, wrote: “It was frequented by pimps, gamblers, and courtesans as well as by the best people. The two worlds had a rare opportunity to study each other over a bowl of chili.”

The Canary Island women and their outdoor dinner parties made San Antonio more hospitable for the Spanish military. Likewise, the flirtatious chili queens spiced up the lives of lonely Anglo cowboys, Texas Rangers, and American military men at a time when women were scarce and San Antonio was the only town on a vast and empty frontier.

##CHILI QUEENS VS. CHILE QUEENS

The English word “chili” and the Spanish word *chile* were used more or less interchangeably in historical accounts of San Antonio’s chili queens (or chile queens). We use the “chili queen” spelling because most Southwestern food writers have adopted the convention of using the English word “chili” for the dish and the Spanish spelling “chile” for the pods.

##PORTRAIT OF A CHILE QUEEN

In 1894, the San Antonio *Daily Express* wrote an article describing “the ever-attentive, always jolly ‘chile queen.’ They are ‘good fellows’ these ‘chile queens’ and are able and willing to talk on any subject that may be named from love to law. As a general rule they are bright, bewitching creatures and put themselves to much trouble to please their too often rowdy customers …”

##SOME OF THE CHILE QUEENS’ FRIENDS

“Every class of people in every station and position in life who come to this city visit the places (chili stands) and partake of the piquant eatables …” — San Antonio *Daily Express*, June 17, 1894

##BEYOND CHILI

San Antonio’s chili stands (or chile stands, as they were often referred to in print) offered a lot more than chili con carne. This 1931 article for the Texas Folk-Lore Society describes a typical menu.

Few tourists can have forgotten the “chile stands” of San Antonio, Texas, once a most interesting feature of the life of that charming city, but abolished within the past two or three years in deference to the “progressive” spirit of certain councilmen.

At these one was always tolerably sure of getting a cup of excellent hot coffee, or one of equally good chocolate, for the making of which the Mexicans are deservedly famous; tea, strange to relate, was never to be had, and milk only only infrequently.

But “chile con carne,” “tamales,” “tortillas,” “chile rellenos,” “huevos revueltos,” “lengua lampreada,” many other kinds of “pucheros” and “ollas” with leathery cheese, burning peppers, stewed tomatoes and many other items too numerous to mention at this time, were always on sale.

Puchero is a stew of any kind; it resembles an “olla”; when made of tripe, it is called by the name “menudo.”

Huevos revueltos are eggs fried on both sides, and served with chile sauce.

Cabra lampreada and lengua lampreada are goat meat or tongue fried in egg.

Frijoles, it goes without saying, appear on every one of these tables.” — John G. Bourke, “The Folk-Foods of the Rio Grande Valley and of Northern Mexico,” in *Southwestern Lore*, ed. J. Frank Dobie. Texas Folk-Lore Society, no. 9 (1931).


A TRIP TO THE MEXICAN QUARTER CHILI STANDS

During the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) hired writers to chronicle American life. Among their projects was *America Eats*, an unpublished book about food. In this excerpt titled “Mexican Quarter Chili Stands,” we get a vivid picture of what it must have been like to eat a “combination plate” at a San Antonio chili stand. Since the chili stands disappeared in the early 1930s, the mythic experience described here would probably be typical of the 1920s.

*No tourist in San Antonio has seen the city until, at night, he has visited the chili stands on Haymarket Plaza, not far from the city’s heart at the nearer edge of the great Mexican quarter.*

*One follows his nose past the Municipal Market in search of the source of an aroma which, once sniffed, is never forgotten — the fragrance of burning mesquite wood. He turns the corner and runs squarely into Old Mexico, as abruptly as walking onto a Hollywood movie set. Tables are spread outdoors along the whole block and behind them women and girls tend fires and charcoal braziers above which Mexican foods are stacked. Three Mexican minstrels, brave in embroidered costumes and high-peaked straw hats, pluck their guitars tentatively, ready to serenade.*

*A Mexican family, plainly in modest circumstances, sits at the first long table, giving itself a night out. He wears his Sunday best and his wife her best reboza [sic] (shawl), one end of it thrown gracefully across her shoulder. There are patches on the clothes of the three small children, but the general effect is one of being scrubbed and starched. The waitress comes to take the order and finally takes it, but only after a long conversation that covers the balminess of the air, neighborhood news, the high cost of living, and remedies for colds. Everything here moves slowly and with graceful ease.*

*The children have tacos, tasty favorite of shine boy and banker alike — a tortilla folded and fried crisp and stuffed with seasoned meat and chopped greens. After much deliberation the parents fix upon enchiladas — tortillas dipped in chili sauce, covered with chopped onion and grated cheese and done up jelly roll style. And now the husband — this obviously is an occasion for special celebration — glances significantly at the expectant musicians. They come to stand close behind the family. Plaintive tenors blend with plaintive guitars in a song about a little princess who, from all accounts, was deeply in love.*

*Now there is a new note — a sort of suppressed excitement. The grapevine has brought word that tourists are approaching and here they come, a party of five. The three serenaders look at them a bit wistfully; had they waited a little longer they would have caught these rich folk. But the newcomers are not to lack for music. As they seat themselves, two small boys — the elder cannot be ten years old—pop up from nowhere, vest-pocket fashion plates of the hidalgo of a century ago. Their costumes are stunning, their guitars almost as large as themselves. Two serenades go on at once, so softly that they complement each other.*

*One of the party of five — the bellwether of this flock — is an elderly gentlemen cut on the pattern of New York and points East.*

*“No chili con carne,” he says. “We ate that in Kansas City.”*

*The waitress looks a bit injured. In the hands of its friends, chili con carne is a soul-warming dish, but in Kansas City, St. Louis, New York, New Haven and Hartford, it may be only a soupy gravy, wholly without any convictions of its own and sometimes even containing such foreign matter as spaghetti. The Easterner’s attention is upon a fire from which floats lazily the fragrance of mesquite mingled with what seems to be the spice of the Indies.*

*“Some of that,” he points out, “and that — and that.”*

*His womenfolk look at him with the admiration that is due to the brave.*

*Some of that and that and that turns out to be two tacos, two enchiladas, and two tamales on each plate, the whole buried under chopped salad greens. The visitors start hesitatingly and gain confidence as they go.*

*Other tourists are arriving, some of whom will try the food although most of them will only look on — and usually add to the receipts of the serenaders, whose groups increase on especially balmy and busy nights. But all of them who patronize the stands will probably depart as soon as they have eaten, which is as they have eaten, which is a matter not wholly to be understood by the Mexican customers. Neither to them or the proprietors of the chili stands does it seem reasonable that even Yanqui customers, whose ways are strange, should hasten to be on their way as soon as they have spent their money. Women are now in a mood for gossip, men for reminiscence. Eating is a social affair, and time is not the all-important thing in life.*

1pys32x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pys32x,Update: Loose leaf teas at Heyday Glorietta,"""where to buy loose leaf tea"" seems to be a perennial question on this sub, so here's another one. not an endorsement btw, just sharing some additional options (especially for beginners, or if taga-south ka/mahirap puntahan ang Binondo). hope others can share snaps of other tea shops as well para makita rin natin.

I made a post about Heyday Glorietta's loose leaf tea section in the past (I wonder if meron din ganito sa ibang Heyday branches? I noticed dumadami na rin sila lately). anyways, the choices of tea change sometimes with availability but here's a few photos I snapped when I was in the area last week.

I would add a note that I'd rate these teas as **beginner-level** since they're really not stored that properly... naka-glass container sila so exposed to a lot of light (which isn't good esp for the green/lighter teas) and they place it literally right next to the coffee (magkahalo din sila as you can see in the picture).

in fact, you can smell the green/white tea jars (there are also smelling containers beside it) and the metallic taste is super strong. I just hope the tea itself doesn't taste like that, never tried it yet. just don't expect the most stellar flavor from these teas, given that the scent is probably degrading slowly each day.

I can vouch at least for the charcoal-baked oolong though. it's almost like a budget preview of Wuyi yancha, which is my favorite kind of tea. mellow, woody, sweet notes. but I don't recall getting many brews out of it.

apologies for the low quality of the pictures as I just snapped them quickly then added some sharpness. here are some of the tea and their prices (per 100gms). by the way, you can bring your own container or pay a small price for either kraft paper bags or a glass jar (not sealed though).

1pys2m2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/1pys2m2/just_started_my_treatment_journey_54m_on_guns/,Just started my treatment journey.  54M on GUNS clinical trial for aggressive local prostate cancer.,"**Where it started.** Dec 2024 had a PSA of 6.8 and referred to a urologist.  I was told to stop drinking coffee and not ejaculate a week before my next PSA test. Came back a couple months later and PSA was 6.3.  Referred for MRI, found lesions, PSA at 6.8. Referred for biopsy and told I have prostate cancer in Oct 2025.  Gleason score 4+5 in one core. 2.7cm cancer on a 3.8cm core on the right base.  Plus a few 3+4 cores.  Characterized as intraductal adenocarcinoma.  Scheduled a PET scan and started looking for an oncologist.  PSA tested at 8.6 and PET came back clean. This was early November, so almost a year.

**Treatment decision**. Diagnosis took so long I wanted nothing to do with my current urologist or his referrals. Plus he was completely offline so I couldn't see anything. After talking to a few places I landed on Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle  I have a great team assigned to me there. Oncologist, radiologist, surgeon and supporting staff are all great.  Anyways, I talk to them all and they all recommended surgery.  I had two options. 

1. Immediate radical prostatectomy 

2. Guns Clinical Trial: ADT\\APA + Gene targeted chemo for six months and then radical prostatectomy.  (You only qualify if it's aggressive local with no signs of metastatic.)

I decided on the GUNS clinical trial for a few reasons.  The trial required, and paid for, a bone scan and CT scan.  So i now know with certainty it hasn't detectably spread.  Detectably is the key here, as there still a chance it's spread microscopically. With a Gleason of 4+5, there's a high chance it's has spread and just isn't detectable.  The main goal is to reduce the chance of recurrence in the future.  Secondary goal is to reduce the size of the tumor to make it easier to remove with, hopefully, better margins.  

From what I understand, these are all drugs currently used in standard of care for prostate cancer.  The biggest difference in this trial is that they're administered prior to prostatectomy. Usually, they're used after radiation or if it's a recurrence. 

**Treatment.** I signed the paperwork for the trial six weeks ago and had a bone scan and CT scan done.  Both came back clean of cancer anywhere outside the prostate. I've had two more PSA tests, 9.6 and then 8.8. (They did find a kidney and liver cyst, which are apparently very common for my age.  Plus a small fat-including umbilical hernia.) I got my 3 month Lupron shot and started on Apalutamide on Monday, Dec 22nd.  It's been a week now and so far, I feel the same, no side effects. From what I understand it could take a month for the testosterone to drop though.  

They've also ordered the genetic test on my core samples to determine the mutation responsible.  In February, I'll start on one of four drugs, depending on the results of that test. 

**Side note on symptom management.**  A couple weeks before I started on the ADT\\APA I started taking Flomax to relieve some symptoms that started effecting me since the biopsy.  Prostate pain and discomfort, weak urine flow etc.  That has helped a lot but caused me to have sinus congestion and pain while laying down.  So my sleep hasn't been great. It's gotten better since I started using Flonase and taking an Advil before bed though.  We're hoping I can go off this once the ADT\\APA starts doing it's thing.

What I read left me speechless. I just found out my boyfriend spends too much time with his co-worker na girl, way moooore time that what he spends on me. We're almost in our 7th year pero in the last 3 years pala na yon, sobrang close nya sa katrabaho nyang babae. Sobrang close to the point na araw araw nyang kausap yung girl during work hours, lampas lampas pa sa work hours nila. 9-12 hours a day? He even calls her in between his meetings, even when he's driving, send her pictures and videos of his whereabouts while all I get is short chats/updates and I feel like he's doing all that because he's obliged to. Lagi nya sinasabi na busy sya sa work and wala na sya time to call me but he does it for that girl. He even calls her pag weekends during his idle time, kahit pag naglalaro sya sa pc nya, kausap nya yung girl, hindi nya ginagawa saken yun kase nga ""naglalaro sya"" May mga short paalala pa sya sa girl na mag pants or hoodie pag nag aangkas, nagpapa unfriend ng mga lalaki, kinakamusta yung girl ganto ganyan. I don't know upto what extent yung closeness nila kase I haven't confronted him yet but I think nagdidinner din sila sometimes kase may mga chat yung girl thanking him for dinner. He also bought the girl birthday and christmas gift, buys her coffee pag may schedule sila ng work in office, simpleng bagay for others but it hurts kase it's the smallest things eh. For me, you don't give that much time, effort and thoughtfulness sa ibang tao if you don't like them or you don't have feelings for them.

  


Context: Boyfriend and I started out as fubus but nagka feelings ako. Wala naman sya balak jowain ako but since ako yung nanjan and ang tagal na nya single, he tried it with me and mukang nag work naman kase natutunan narin nya ko mahalin, in short, nag settle lang sya sakin kasi ako yung nanjan. Now I feel like he's organically falling in love with this girl, parang slowburn na ewan kase yung conversation nila is hindi pilit, natural yung flow ng humor nila and all. By the looks of it, he's calling and texting the girl dahil gusto nya and not because he's obliged to do so. 3 fvcking years, ginagawa nya lahat yun consistently sa girl. Sobrang sakit lang. Ano ba ko dito? Trophy gf? Safe choice? Gusto ko ilaban pero pakiramdam ko kahit ako piliin nya nasa iba mind and heart nya. Ang unfair sa pakiramdam.





Previous Attempts: Wala pa, I am thinking of confronting the girl, maybe she doesn't know that I exist. Or I am thinking of asking my boyfriend about it but I feel like ide-deny nya lang lahat.

So, a month ago, really intense nausea hits me out of nowhere at work, 2 hours after eating veggie sushi. I take a zofran (i have chronic nausea), but it got worse, so I went home. 

I get home, and after a few retches, I puke the sushi into the bathtub... then almost immidetely feel better. However, that night, and the next few days, I have really bad stomach cramps after eating anything. I though I was constipated, so 2 days later... i take miralax with coffee. You can guess how that went; had to go to urgent care for all the fluid loss from diarrhea, lol! 

So, of course - i threw up once, not every 15 mins for 8 hours like I usually do from noro, and felt better as soon as i puked up the sushi - must have been food poisoning, right? Well, all my results came back negative for any abnormal bacteria, or parasites. Which makes me wonder... it could have been noro. (Which, in my ocd brain, is the worst thing. I'm less scared of vomiting itself and more scared of norovirus). Maybe the zofran helped? I don't know. Either way - my worst fear happened, and I was fine. I think the nausea/anticipatory anxiety is the worst of it all. 

I do still struggle with noro contamination ocd, and i've been having a flare up recently; just wanted to remind myself and others of a (positive?) experience. Even if ""it"" happens - it doesn't mean it's going to be all nightmare mode. And i've *been* in nightmare mode - vomiting every 15 mins for 8 hours - and I made it out the other side.

What surprised me isn’t that “perfectly plastic-free” designs are rare. That part makes sense. What surprised me is how rarely brands publish anything concrete beyond marketing claims like “BPA-free,” “food-grade,” or “no plastic touches the water,” without clarifying:

 - which specific parts that applies to
 - what materials are used instead
 - whether any migration, leaching, or heat-stability testing has been done
 - and if so, whether it was internal or third-party

From what I’ve seen so far, very few brands publish anything resembling independent test reports or detailed material disclosures — most information still seems marketing-level.

From a zero-waste / low-tox perspective, this lack of material transparency feels like a bigger problem than the existence of a small gasket or seal.

Is this just normal for the appliance industry?

Or are there brands that actually publish migration tests, material breakdowns, or certifications and I’m just not finding them?

1pyrov0,https://i.redd.it/j8na1pz7d6ag1.jpeg,24 Hour Belt Kit,"Happy New Year all! After a ton of tweaking and ebaying for deals, I’ve got my 24 hour belt together. 

Why: This belt is set up so I can do one of three things. A) Just carry 24 hrs worth of sustainment. B) keeping my back free for dedicated med or rescue bags while carrying sustainment. C) Add capacity to my normal 72 hr bag which stretches my capability out to about 5 days. 

But: Ammo? Holster? I don’t carry a weapon, it’s not part of my job. 

Also, I have my flashlight, folder, IFAK, and emergency tin on body.

You can have any color you want…: Black is a uniform requirement. And even if it wasn’t, I’m trying to not look .mil or like the national guard. 

What’s on the beeeeelllllllt: Okay. Meat and potatoes. 

-Belt: Blackhawk duty belt from 20 years ago. 

-Cover: ATS war belt. This is a really neat GWOT innovation. 

-Straps: Blackhawk H-harness with hydration pocket. (Because obviously.) If needed I’ll fold two Splints into the hydration sleeve around the bladder. I don’t typically carry the radio as I’m not in a leadership position, but I do have a radio pouch that attaches to the strap pad if I need to be that guy. 

Left to right:

-2 Qt canteen pouch: Food (coffee, Gatorade powder, snacks, and mains) or procedural kits, based on need. Iodine dropper bottle in the outer pocket

-1 L (what? Standard and metric?) Nalgine bottle. 

-Maxpedition dump pouch: (Very few people talk policing their trash during wilderness med, but it’s a giant PITA, but this is a PJ thing and I unrepentantly stole it.)

Blackhawk LRRP buttpack: Three outer packs are my water cleaning kit and electronics pouch, my fire and cook kit, and eye pro, tech gloves and a hat (either watch cap or boonie). Lid is OTC’s in a Plano outside, contacts and glasses inside. Main pouch is either a fleece or rain top, repair kit, roll of tape, and a spare headlamp. Bottom inside of the main pouch is a contractor bag. If I need the 2qt pouch for med gear, I’ll throw a stripped meal in here and jockey other contents. 

Blackhawk EMT pouch: either med diagnostics or a 500ml IV kit, based on scenario. Headlamp or chem lights in outer pouch. 
 
NARP CCRK Chest pouch: STB gear, RitR EMS pad, trainer’s tape. Atleast one TQ in the outer pouch. The second slot is either the second TQ or a leatherman. 

So behold…. My stuff. I’m always open to notes and suggestion. And I would love input from other guys with dedicated sustainment/med belts.

I have no brand affiliations from anything listed. I would love some, though. 🫶Slide into those DM’s. ",13,1767027919.0,tacticalgear,5,1.0,False

I had to harass him to call his own insurance company to find out if he had insurance, he is supposed to be enrolled in a cooking class by spring but his mom has to do it?.. idk, we don’t have seggs anymore but he says “the love is still there!” All of this is starting to make me resent him and I don’t want that, I’ve talked to him before and he just hears me.

It’s like he always has to be right, and even if your the one that’s right he will find a way to make you feel wrong, and then 2 hours later, apologize for everything he did and said but that doesn’t matter when it will happen 3 days later, literally.

On Christmas morning he asked me to look in this giant bin of shoes in our shared closet we have for his shoes, they weren’t there I looked. He said “you have to dig deeper!!” I got frustrated because I looked in there they weren’t there, long story short he literally exploded on me for that, I was trying to just get some space and he kept coming back with the same thing, like just stop, you know when your both fighting and you just want to sit by yourself I just wanted to sit by myself for 5 minutes he just kept yelling in my face.

Writing can be a lonely endeavor, but it does not have to be. Currently, it is for me, though.  Due to various circumstances in my life, including but not limited to disability and narrow specialisation, I am planning to spend 2026 mostly at home at my desk, and, even though part of that time will be dedicated to a paying job in research, I believe i will have more than enough time to pursue my passion project, a book about interesting and unusual insects for pre-teens. I would love to have enough text written and edited by the end of 2026, so that I could look into finding an illustrator in early 2027. 

So far, I'm at under 10% of the total first draft, as I'm aiming for  about 80-100 chapters of 600-700 words each, plus a good comprehensive introduction in entomology and a glossary of ""big words"" that come up a lot when discussing insects.  I am not a native speaker of English, but I have decided to attempt writing in English because my native language has very few speakers, and the number keeps dwindling. 

I myself (35F) am located in Eastern Europe (time zone EET or GMT+2)  and mostly plan to write during normal office hours.  I am mostly looking for real-time companionship, as my main hurdle in writing is unfulfilled social needs. I work best by locking in for 45 minutes to 2 hours and then spending 10-15 minutes shooting shit/ sharing progress/ asking for or giving feedback/ getting the fun facts I have found while researching out of the system. Human contact gives me little dopamine fixes that help me survive until I hit decent milestones. (I might or might not be ADHD, but I don't believe it is critically important). In exchange, I can be your hype squad, rant receptacle, coffee break buddy, wall to throw spaghetti at to see what sticks, you name it. 

  
You don't necessarily have to be a non-fiction writer, but I don't think I can give too much meaningful feedback on fiction if that's what you are after. It is just not my medium. I speak English and Latvian in a meaningful capacity, and I can give some input on the use of Latin-based terminology in science.

1pyrnys,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1pyrnys/the_problem_is_with_the_time_i_can_spend_with_my/,The problem is with the time I can spend with my partner,"Hi all.

This is more of a post after the fact, as we broke up on my initiative. But I'd like to reflect a little on what happened.

He's was a 26-year-old man, also diagnosed with Asperger's. I work two days a week, two days a week is my free time, and at the beginning of our relationship, we were the perfect tandem of understanding and mutual support.

We entered into a relationship unofficially, meaning, without prior discussion, we moved on to closer physical contact, as it suited us both. He wasn't a fan of social interaction and didn't have a steady job, which sometimes led to outright hatred for people due to a misunderstanding of his problems and the world around him. Problems began when he began asking to spend time with me constantly, coming to my place after work to spend the night. I was drawn to him, but I expected a slightly different format of relationship and was accustomed to people being busy.

He promised not to distract me, but everything came down to constant hugs and physical contact.We tried to discuss these issues and set a schedule, and he was accommodating. But although we had common interests, his ADHD meant he quickly lost focus on other shared activities, or they were no longer interesting because we were in a relationship and he only wanted physical contact. For example, playing online or calling each other when I couldn't come because I had sensory overload.

He didn't understand the sensory overload issues, although there were probably no conflicts or pressure. He said that people in love want to spend time with each other constantly, and I was acting strangely. I nedeed more than one day a week to recharge, and if we didn't spend three or more days together, he would become ""anxious about me"" (he emphasized that this wasn't synonymous with ""not being happy with what I wanted""). We dated for no more than two months, and I didn't mind spending so much time together, but everything seemed to fall apart in an instant. He said we could both go outside, like lock ourselves in another room, but we both live in a one-bedroom apartment, and locking ourselves in the bathroom two steps away was no longer an option for me.

He didn't want to go outside afterward because it would be stupid if he came to see me, and if he went to the store, he tried to get back quickly. I couldn't go outside because he, again, would get worried if I took a long time to get to the coffee shop, meaning I didn't want to spend time with him, even though he came to see me. And just leaving and hanging around outside is difficult; I live in Russia, and late winter and autumn are cold. As I've probably already said, we had common interests. But he disliked anything to do with people, so we couldn't go to the fair or anywhere, even though he said we could for my sake. But later, when we met in person, he said he didn't like it and felt uncomfortable being in such places. I, for my part, tried to go to the woods with him and just take walks, but I'd get incredibly cold, and we couldn't go anywhere. Because there were people there.

Then a series of events occurred where my patience simply wore thin because I said I wanted to change my job to a more flexible one. He thought the problem lay in this and my childhood traumas. He thought it was cool, but offered nothing in return. I had to loan him money that wasn't repaid. I didn't have a problem with that, but God, I'd also like for the man to work. I mentioned this, and he said that work is hard and requires communication with people, and we're talking about our relationship.

Plus, he broke up with his friends because of a confict, which I don't blame him for, and he finally had nothing else to do except spend time with me. He has a ton of interests, but he gave them all up for me. He didn't want to discuss these issues; he asked what I wanted. Articulating it... It just didn't help. It's not my responsibility, I think. It all came down to the fact that people in love want to be with each other. I told him that when we're together, I have to constantly interact so he doesn't get bored, and he asked again, ""What's the problem? We love each other, we should interact.""

In the end, I told him I didn't want this, that I wasn't being heard, and he said I had no feelings and that I preferred being alone to him. I'd like to know how much of this situation was my fault, because now I'm broken. Is it even normal for autistic people to be hurt by the touch of a loved one? Sometimes I just wanted to kill him.",0,1767027863.0,autism,3,0.5,False

1. A video of a waitress carrying a tray of water glasses. One of the glasses starts sliding to the edge of the tray. It doesn't fall down or spill anything, but the waitress will react normally (a bit surprised).

Every time I try to generate this, the waitress keeps picking up a glass and moving it to the edge of the tray. Sometimes it just pulls a glass out of thin air and puts it in the tray.

2. A video of a man typing on a laptop with a coffee cup beside the laptop. He'll try and reach for the cup bit will accidentally bump into and and spill the coffee on the laptop's keyboard.

Same with number 1, he'll always pick up the cup and will spill coffee on the laptop.

  
I tried all the techniques I can find (JSON, image reference, ingredients, start and end frames,) I tried various custom GPTs and instructions to help make the prompt. I tried a lot of negative prompts just to prevent it from happening, but it still always ends up scuffed/hallucinating.

1pyrkbo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pyrkbo,CCAR MENU 2,"Today we’re taking a look at the CCAR Menu 2 Chicken Burrito Bowl High Energy.  This ration consists of:

Chicken Burrito Bowl, High Energy
Lemon Pepper Tuna
Chocolate Banana Nut Dessert Bar
Teriyaki Meat Sticks
Apple Pie Dessert Spread
Almond and Coconut Nut Bar
Nut and Raisin Mix with Pan Coated Choc Disks
Cherry Licorice Bites
Plain Tortillas
Cheddar Cheese Spread,
Oatmeal Cookie
Raspberry Energy Gel Chocolate Energy Gel
Lemon-Lime Carbohydrate Electrolyte Beverage Powder
Picante Seasoning
Peppermint Caffeinated Chewing Gum
Spoon
Toilet Tissue
Hand Wipe (2)
Insert Card
Re-closeable Interlocking Plastic Bag

For breakfast I decided on teriyaki beef stick, chocolate banana nut dessert bar, nut raisin mix, mocha energy gel, lemon lime drink mix, and MEG.  The beef stick was as expected, a standard US ration component that didn’t stand out much other than it being really fresh.  The dessert bar again like the other day isn’t the greatest, the texture was definitely better than the coconut one but it still reminds me of really thick bad buttercream.  The nut raisin mix is way better than the trail mix from menu 1, it wasn’t as dry, there was a nice variety of textures and flavors.  I was intrigued when reading the ingredients that there is a supplemental vegetable protein coating on the mix, I also noticed some of the raisin seem huge but there is just a generic “raisins” listed in the ingredients.  The new star of breakfast was the mocha energy gel, compared to previous energy gels of other rations this one is fantastic. It had a very smooth and silky texture, was very sweet and reminded me of a coffee flavored drink syrup, also interesting that though it lists coffee extract in the ingredients it doesn’t list any caffeine content.  Though it doesn’t have caffeine it could be very satisfying to mix with hot water for a faux coffee drink, I also suspect that if would be good to put on the trail mix from menu to bring it some life.  The drink mix like the protein powder in the first menu dissolved surprisingly well and makes me wonder if it’s the freshness of the ration that is helping in that aspect or if they reformulated them to mix better.

For lunch I picked the lemon-pepper tuna, tortillas, cheese spread, coconut almond nut bar, and chocolate energy gel.  After prepping lunch I decided to save the cheese and tortillas for dinner, I also decided to go for it and make the chocolate energy gel into a hot drink.  I mixed a 1/4 canteen cup of hot water with the whole packet and stirred it in.  It made a very rich and sweet chocolate beverage that made me think of yoohoo but not milky.  After making that the mocha would definitely be great made into a hot drink.  The coconut almond bar looked like a commercial item but didn’t come in an other package. If you’re into coconut you’ll love it, my wife sure did, it had a nice mild sweetness, was sticky but not rip out your teeth sticky and was nice and chewy.  Though like other components I wonder how it will age and I feel like it’s going to turn into a brick with time.  The tuna really needs help in this ration, no fat-free mayo to lubricate it so it’s kinda hard to choke down, luckily I’m at home and not in the field so I had some garlic aioli to save it from the trash but I’m seriously not sure how this is going to be eaten in the field.

On to dinner I saved the best for last with the chicken burrito bowl high energy with picante seasoning, cheese spread, tortillas, oatmeal cookie, MRE apple pie dessert spread, and twizzler nibs. The resealable bag really came in handy for saving those tortillas after they had been opened, they would probably have been trash if it wasn’t for that.  And though they were more fresh than usual they were still not very soft at room temp bur at least they didn’t bust the seam this time.  The main was a little less than optimal without being heated but it wasn’t terrible after kneeding the packet and warming it up a little with body heat.  It does come out the pouch in a rather unappealing way in that it kinda looks like texmex turd on a tortilla.  However with the cheese spread and picante seasoning it was actually really nice.  The beans and rice has a noticeable chewy to them but not quite underdone, it had some nice chicken chunks that tasted and felt rather natural not super processed.  This is the first time I’ve gotten the twizzler nibs that weren’t basically red rocks, my wife with definitely enjoy those later.  Lastly I crushed up the oatmeal cookie and added the apple pie spread and that was definitely the way to go, if it could have been warmed up it would have been very reminiscent of a apple cobbler or baked apple crisp, 10/10 would recommend that combination.

In conclusion this menu felt (other than the tuna) much more cohesive and intentional.  It was also much more filling than the first menu though that may be because I didn’t finish several components in the first menu and ate almost everything in this menu.  I have also noticed, after eating this menu, that they were both rather thirst provoking and that may be intentional to keep warfighters drinking essential water to stay hydrated for duty.

Thanks for checking this ration out with me today and I’ll be back in a few days with the final menu from this new innovative ration.",11,1767027651.0,MRE,0,1.0,False

Since I joined my husbands family 13 years ago my FIL has always been really inappropriate with the things he says and the way he acts. He’s made comments about little things like how my hair color turns him on and turns almost every into a sexual comment. He made jokes about my best friend requesting for he to come over only if she is wearing lingerie instead of pjs to a family event. He’s made comments to other members in the family about my MIL engagement ring saying that if she wanted a ring like that then she “needs to give good head”. It’s more than just  a “that’s what she said” joke, they are direct and inappropriate towards the person he is talking to. To note this is my husband’s step dad who got caught cheating at the beginning of his mom’s relationship with him. Shortly after they reconciled they became swingers(this is important later). They got engaged shortly after us and then married shortly after us. My FIL has also been fired from photography gigs because he made the models feel uncomfortable. One even fired him on the spot because he was to “creepy” he also was fired from lyfe for making sexual advances to too many women. 

About 7 years into my husband and my relationship we became pregnant with our first daughter. Throughout my pregnancy my FIL was pressuring me to do a naked photo photoshoot of my pregnancy. Any time we visited it would come up multiple times. No matter how many times I said no he would keep asking. My husband and I eventually moved 3 hours ways from them and about 9 months later had our second child. We have tried to make it clear that my FIL comments are not okay near the children. Generally it’s laughed off that I’m being too protective. Last Christmas we were doing a white elephant exchange and my FIL opened a gift it was a wooden cutting board with a handle he looked at their friend from their swingers group that was there and said we can use this for our BDSM later. I was so upset that he made comments like this with both of my children there and told him that was 100% not appropriate conversation near the girls. He laughed at me so did my MIL and said my children aren’t smart enough to understand it. I responded telling him it doesn’t matter if he thinks they are or not it’s never appropriate to bring up sexual things in front of my children, they just kept laughing. 

A few months ago my FIL was found on the local swingers group in the town my husband and I live in which is 3 hours away from where they live. It made my husband an I a little uneasy. When they visit my FIL would disappear in the morning before anyone would be up besides me and come back hours later saying he was getting coffee. I brought all of this up and said at this point we don’t feel comfortable with my FIL in our home anymore and would like him not to come for visits. When they visit they don’t really spend time with the girls anyways because they are on the computers or phones the whole time. So I’m trying to entertain people who want to do nothing with the girls and act annoyed when my young kids act like young kids. My MIL lost her mind and started defending every piece of evidence we had. She was here this last weekend and tried telling me my town didn’t have any swingers group at all and saying I was making it up. She defended his comments saying it was just from his generation and I need to not be as sensitive. He’s already made comments about my oldest body and she’s 4, in my mind it’s only going to get worse and I refuse to have my daughters sexually harassed by their step grandpa because his wife refuses to open her eyes and see who she is married to. She told me that she cannot be expected to come to our home and enjoy herself if her husband isn’t welcomed. So AITAH?",81,1767027633.0,AITAH,72,0.94,False

I'll be honest, once you add an outdoor daybed to your backyard, you'll wonder why you waited so long. It's one of those pieces that instantly makes a space feel like a resort. But just plopping one down and calling it a day won't cut it. The magic is in how you style it. Get it right, and it becomes the spot everyone gravitates toward. Get it wrong, and it just sits there collecting leaves. Here's how to nail it.

1. **Where's the best spot to put an outdoor daybed?**

Somewhere that feels like a little escape. Under a pergola works great. So does a shaded corner near some greenery or beneath a mature tree. You want it to feel slightly tucked away like your own private nook. One thing to keep in mind: avoid full sun all day long. It gets uncomfortably hot, and your fabrics will fade faster than you'd expect.

1.  **What kind of cushions should I use?**

Don't skimp here. Thin, flimsy cushions are the fastest way to ruin the whole vibe. Nobody wants to lie on something that feels like a park bench. Go for outdoor daybed cushions with thick, high-density foam that actually supports you. You should be able to sink in a little and feel like staying for hours. That's the whole point.

1. **How do I stop everything from looking worn out after a few months?**

It comes down to fabric. [Sunbrella cushions for outdoor furniture](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/sunbrella-cushions) are honestly the gold standard for a reason. They handle rain, sun, and spills without falling apart or fading. Pair that with removable, zippered covers you can toss in the wash, and you're set. A little upfront investment saves you from replacing everything every year.

1. **What styling details actually make a difference?**

Layers. Start with your main cushions in a solid, neutral shade. Then throw in a few accent [throw pillows](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/pillow) with some pattern or texture. A lightweight blanket draped casually on one side adds warmth—literally and visually. And don't forget a small side table nearby for your coffee, a book, or a glass of wine. It's the little things that make a space feel finished.

1.  **Is a canopy worth adding?**

If you've got the setup for it, absolutely. A canopy gives that dreamy, vacation feel and keeps the sun off you during the hottest part of the day. Sheer curtains around the daybed look gorgeous and add a bit of privacy without making things stuffy. Even a simple umbrella nearby does the trick if a full canopy isn't practical.

1. **What should I avoid doing?**

Piling on too many pillows is a classic mistake—you still need room to actually stretch out. Skipping maintenance is another one. Brush off the cushions regularly, bring them in during storms, and clean up spills before they set. Also, think about lighting. A few string lights or lanterns mean you can actually use your daybed after dark.

A well-styled outdoor daybed changes how you use your backyard. It becomes the place for slow mornings, lazy afternoons, and long conversations. Invest in comfort, pick materials that last, and layer in those finishing touches. That's really all it takes to create a retreat you'll actually want to use.

Like a lot of people on here, I'm pretty tired of dating apps. I’m a 31-year-old guy who’s been on and off them for about 10 years. I was in an 8-month relationship that ended around five months ago — she broke up with me. Since then, I’ve tried getting back on the apps, but honestly, it hasn’t gone well.  

The breakup really took a toll on me. I’m starting to turn the corner, but I know I still have some work to do to move on and be a better version of myself. On top of that, work has been stressful and a little disappointing lately.  

When I scroll through the apps, it feels like I see the same people over and over — and if I do find someone I’m into, we never match. I’ve read and watched plenty about the pros and cons of dating apps, but here’s what bothers me most:  

1. There are so many options that people give up on someone way too easily.  

2. They can make me feel sad or discouraged.  

3. Honestly, they sometimes make me feel even lonelier.  

I’m getting older, and I really do want to settle down, get married, and start a family one day. But the harder I try, the less it seems to work out on dates. I’ve never really gone more than a week without using dating apps when I’m single — I’m constantly searching for someone. Yet here I am, still looking.  

So I’ve decided I need to do something different. As a society, we’ve gotten so used to connecting through our phones that real in-person interaction feels harder — and I’ll admit, it even makes me a bit nervous. But maybe that’s exactly what I need.  

My goal for the start of 2026 is to take a break from dating apps and focus on meeting people in person. I’m going to join a co-ed bowling league, hang out at local coffee shops, and just get out more in general. I want to do things for myself and be more social overall.  

If you’ve read this far, thanks for listening to my rant. For those who’ve taken this approach — how did it work for you? Where did you meet people if you weren’t using apps? And what types of hobbies or co-ed activities helped you meet new friends or potential partners? I’m not going into this expecting to meet “the one,” but I do want to build connections and maybe find something real again.

“Mr. Sinclair, I’ll marry you,” Sophia Fraley slurred. She’d just killed half a bottle of vodka, and her tongue felt three sizes too big. 

A long silence answered her. Then a deep, sleepy voice came through, irritation clear beneath the gravel. “You even know what time it is?” 

She squinted at her phone and finally saw two in the morning. “Sorry. I’ll call tomorrow.” 

“Okay,” Henry Sinclair muttered. 

She blinked. “Wait, what?” 

“I’ll leave on a business trip in the morning. Back in four weeks. We’ll sign the papers then,” he said. 

“Oh… okay.” 

The line clicked off. Sophia stared at the screen, her head spinning. 

Two weeks earlier, her aunt Amanda, who lived in a distant small town, had called. 

She said, “Belinda, the old lady next door, she’s got this perfect grandson, Henry. Honors student, decent college, city job, dental plan, and even Christmas bonuses. I think maybe I can see you guys up.” 

Sophia agreed to shut her up, planning to ghost. 

That same night, however, Henry phoned. “No time for blind dates or small talk,” he’d said. “If you’re up for it, let’s skip straight to the courthouse.” 

‘Is this guy nuts?’ she wondered, blindsided. 

He didn’t wait for an answer. “Sleep on it,” he said, and the line went dead. 

She hadn’t thought about it once, until tonight, drunk and lonely she dialed. 

Sophia flicked through her phone, and the internet was still losing it. The NO.1 on the feed: Charlotte Wynn, A-list queen. knocked up. And the guy everyone swore was the father was Richard Lane, the married leading man. 

The “home-wrecker” hashtags were flying when Andrew Carter, he Carter Group’s spare heir, suddenly jumped in. 

He posted: \[She’s my girl, the baby’s mine, and we’re walking down the aisle. Chill.\] 

Skeptics kept clapping back, so Andrew dropped a clip from Charlotte’s last birthday: him on one knee, ring box open, and her squealing yes. 

Overnight, the comment section flipped to heart-emojis and champagne gifs. 

Now the top tag was simply: \[Charlotte’s marrying Andrew Cartel 

Sophia stared at the screen, half-laughing, half-sick. T’m his girlfriend, and he’s out there proposing to someone else? Eight years, and I don’t even get a goodbye text. Fine. Time to bail before the joke’s on me 

And Henry had said it so casually on the phone: “I just want the gular deal. Have each other’s backs, stay cool, and grow gray together. That single sentence sold her.

Boring, maybe, but it sounded like heaven. Andrew had never even once offered her a boring promise. 

She took a breath and then yanked her suitcase from the closet. The villa was in Andrew’s name, she was only a visitor who’d overstayed. Time to ghost before the happy couple came home. 

Sophia had an early shift, so she’d only grabbed a couple of hours of sleep before dragging herself downstairs. 

Andrew was spread across the couch, hair wrecked, brows pinched like the liquor still had a grip. 

She side-stepped the mess and started making breakfast. 

While the coffee brewed, Andrew shuffled into the kitchen, breath still boozy, and draped himself over her shoulders. 

He muttered. “Babe, my head’s splitting. Make me that hangover drink, yeah?” 

Sophia frowned, “Go sit on the couch. I’ll be there in two minutes.” 

“But I wanna stay with you,” he mumbled, his eyes still closed. 

“You smell awful,” she said, wrinkling her nose. 

“Really?” He sniffed his shirt and grimaced. “Okay, shower first.” 

She filled the blender with ice, a fistful of fresh mint, orange juice, a big squeeze of honey, and a pinch of salt. It was the homemade reset button she kept ready for his late-night client dinners. 

The machine buzzed. The sound dragged her straight back to every other morning-after. ‘Eight years of curing his hangover; zero years of curing his wandering eye, she laughed under her breath. ‘Fine. Last batch. Period at the end of the relationship.’ 

By the time he padded downstairs, the glass was sweating on the counter. He pressed the cold rim to his temple, took a slow sip of the minty honey slush, and didn’t offer a word about last night. 

“Congrats,” she said. 

“For what?” He looked up, blank. 

“After so many years of birthday proposals, Charlotte finally took the bait,” she said calmly. 

She had always known about Charlotte. The crush had lasted fifteen years, ever since junior high. On every single birthday, Andrew dropped to one knee and proposed. He never missed one, not even during the eight years he spent with Sophia. 

‘Of course I care. The thought tasted bitter, but she had loved him enough to play the fool. 

Andrew frowned. “You saw the feed?” 

Sophia just looked at him, saying nothing. 

It’s PR,’ he said, like he was reading the weather. “Once the noise dies down, we file for divorce. Chill.” 

She scoffed, “PR So you’re actually getting a marriage license and throwing a real wedding?” 

“Of course, he replied. “Otherwise, my family would never buy 

“Then how is that just PR? You’re getting married,” she shot back 

“It’s fake, alright? Quit digging,” he muttered, downing the last of the smoothie and heading upstairs.

“I don’t want to referee whatever circus you and Charlotte haveing.” Sophia said, “but you and I still need to close our books.” 

Andrew turned and stared at her. “Close what books?” 

She drew a slow breath. “We’re done. I’m out.” 

“Are you even listening?” he barked. “The wedding is staged. We untie it the second the cameras leave. Why the drama? This doesn’t touch you. Just play dumb and wait it out. You need the attention that bad?” 

Have you ever paid any attention to me at all?’ The thought stung. “Real or staged, I’m out,” she said, voice level. “We’re over, Andrew.” 

“Sophia,” he barked. 

Tm exhausted.” She shut her eyes. “Eight years of loving you has emptied the tank. That’s enough. I’m out.” 

“Fine, walk! Just don’t come crawling back.” He snatched his coat and slammed the door. 

Silence. For the first time, Sophia felt the weight slide off her shoulders and stay gone. 

Sophia was an OB-GYN at Carter Hospital. She got to her office early and juggled patients while Maggie, the nurse, rattled off the latest gossip. 

Maggie sighed, “So whose baby is Charlotte really carrying? First it was Richard, and now it’s Andrew. If it were me, I’d pick Andrew. He’s loaded and crazy-hot. 

“Plus, he’s been hung up on her for fifteen straight years. That’s. Ike, lifetime-movie devotion.” 

Sophia couldn’t take any more. She told Maggie to take one of the moms-to-be upstairs for her exam.

If I buy a gaggia classic e24: does the gagimate make everything easier or does it make it more complex? I hear a lot of people say ‘first learn the basics of the machine out of the box’, but I also hear ‘when you install the gagimate, you have to relearn everything’. It makes little sense to me to first struggle a year and when I get the hang of it, start all over with the gagimate. 

My plan is to have eventually a great espresso every morning. I’m also a big home automation fan, so the gagimate will be on my list sooner or later since I love gadgets en mods. I automate my entire house, so why not my coffee machine! Being an engineer it’s what I love and install should be fairly easy to do. 

So my plan at the moment: gaggia classic e24 with a df54 grinder, and adding the gagimate. It does have a hefty price tag!

“Mr. Sinclair, I’ll marry you,” Sophia Fraley slurred. She’d just killed half a bottle of vodka, and her tongue felt three sizes too big. 

A long silence answered her. Then a deep, sleepy voice came through, irritation clear beneath the gravel. “You even know what time it is?” 

She squinted at her phone and finally saw two in the morning. “Sorry. I’ll call tomorrow.” 

“Okay,” Henry Sinclair muttered. 

She blinked. “Wait, what?” 

“I’ll leave on a business trip in the morning. Back in four weeks. We’ll sign the papers then,” he said. 

“Oh… okay.” 

The line clicked off. Sophia stared at the screen, her head spinning. 

Two weeks earlier, her aunt Amanda, who lived in a distant small town, had called. 

She said, “Belinda, the old lady next door, she’s got this perfect grandson, Henry. Honors student, decent college, city job, dental plan, and even Christmas bonuses. I think maybe I can see you guys up.” 

Sophia agreed to shut her up, planning to ghost. 

That same night, however, Henry phoned. “No time for blind dates or small talk,” he’d said. “If you’re up for it, let’s skip straight to the courthouse.” 

‘Is this guy nuts?’ she wondered, blindsided. 

He didn’t wait for an answer. “Sleep on it,” he said, and the line went dead. 

She hadn’t thought about it once, until tonight, drunk and lonely she dialed. 

Sophia flicked through her phone, and the internet was still losing it. The NO.1 on the feed: Charlotte Wynn, A-list queen. knocked up. And the guy everyone swore was the father was Richard Lane, the married leading man. 

The “home-wrecker” hashtags were flying when Andrew Carter, he Carter Group’s spare heir, suddenly jumped in. 

He posted: \[She’s my girl, the baby’s mine, and we’re walking down the aisle. Chill.\] 

Skeptics kept clapping back, so Andrew dropped a clip from Charlotte’s last birthday: him on one knee, ring box open, and her squealing yes. 

Overnight, the comment section flipped to heart-emojis and champagne gifs. 

Now the top tag was simply: \[Charlotte’s marrying Andrew Cartel 

Sophia stared at the screen, half-laughing, half-sick. T’m his girlfriend, and he’s out there proposing to someone else? Eight years, and I don’t even get a goodbye text. Fine. Time to bail before the joke’s on me 

And Henry had said it so casually on the phone: “I just want the gular deal. Have each other’s backs, stay cool, and grow gray together. That single sentence sold her.

Boring, maybe, but it sounded like heaven. Andrew had never even once offered her a boring promise. 

She took a breath and then yanked her suitcase from the closet. The villa was in Andrew’s name, she was only a visitor who’d overstayed. Time to ghost before the happy couple came home. 

Sophia had an early shift, so she’d only grabbed a couple of hours of sleep before dragging herself downstairs. 

Andrew was spread across the couch, hair wrecked, brows pinched like the liquor still had a grip. 

She side-stepped the mess and started making breakfast. 

While the coffee brewed, Andrew shuffled into the kitchen, breath still boozy, and draped himself over her shoulders. 

He muttered. “Babe, my head’s splitting. Make me that hangover drink, yeah?” 

Sophia frowned, “Go sit on the couch. I’ll be there in two minutes.” 

“But I wanna stay with you,” he mumbled, his eyes still closed. 

“You smell awful,” she said, wrinkling her nose. 

“Really?” He sniffed his shirt and grimaced. “Okay, shower first.” 

She filled the blender with ice, a fistful of fresh mint, orange juice, a big squeeze of honey, and a pinch of salt. It was the homemade reset button she kept ready for his late-night client dinners. 

The machine buzzed. The sound dragged her straight back to every other morning-after. ‘Eight years of curing his hangover; zero years of curing his wandering eye, she laughed under her breath. ‘Fine. Last batch. Period at the end of the relationship.’ 

By the time he padded downstairs, the glass was sweating on the counter. He pressed the cold rim to his temple, took a slow sip of the minty honey slush, and didn’t offer a word about last night. 

“Congrats,” she said. 

“For what?” He looked up, blank. 

“After so many years of birthday proposals, Charlotte finally took the bait,” she said calmly. 

She had always known about Charlotte. The crush had lasted fifteen years, ever since junior high. On every single birthday, Andrew dropped to one knee and proposed. He never missed one, not even during the eight years he spent with Sophia. 

‘Of course I care. The thought tasted bitter, but she had loved him enough to play the fool. 

Andrew frowned. “You saw the feed?” 

Sophia just looked at him, saying nothing. 

It’s PR,’ he said, like he was reading the weather. “Once the noise dies down, we file for divorce. Chill.” 

She scoffed, “PR So you’re actually getting a marriage license and throwing a real wedding?” 

“Of course, he replied. “Otherwise, my family would never buy 

“Then how is that just PR? You’re getting married,” she shot back 

“It’s fake, alright? Quit digging,” he muttered, downing the last of the smoothie and heading upstairs.

“I don’t want to referee whatever circus you and Charlotte haveing.” Sophia said, “but you and I still need to close our books.” 

Andrew turned and stared at her. “Close what books?” 

She drew a slow breath. “We’re done. I’m out.” 

“Are you even listening?” he barked. “The wedding is staged. We untie it the second the cameras leave. Why the drama? This doesn’t touch you. Just play dumb and wait it out. You need the attention that bad?” 

Have you ever paid any attention to me at all?’ The thought stung. “Real or staged, I’m out,” she said, voice level. “We’re over, Andrew.” 

“Sophia,” he barked. 

Tm exhausted.” She shut her eyes. “Eight years of loving you has emptied the tank. That’s enough. I’m out.” 

“Fine, walk! Just don’t come crawling back.” He snatched his coat and slammed the door. 

Silence. For the first time, Sophia felt the weight slide off her shoulders and stay gone. 

Sophia was an OB-GYN at Carter Hospital. She got to her office early and juggled patients while Maggie, the nurse, rattled off the latest gossip. 

Maggie sighed, “So whose baby is Charlotte really carrying? First it was Richard, and now it’s Andrew. If it were me, I’d pick Andrew. He’s loaded and crazy-hot. 

“Plus, he’s been hung up on her for fifteen straight years. That’s. Ike, lifetime-movie devotion.” 

Sophia couldn’t take any more. She told Maggie to take one of the moms-to-be upstairs for her exam. 

She’d barely sat down when Andrew called. He demanded, “Clear your schedule. Charlotte’s coming in for her prenatal

**Chuck E Cheese: $10 off $30 “dining voucher” via Groupon**

Our even older friend Chuck E. Cheese is also somehow still alive and kicking, despite [going through bankruptcy](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/10/chuck-e-cheese-makes-comeback-after-bankruptcy.html) a few years ago. 

There’s a [Groupon](https://www.groupon.com/deals/chuck-e-cheese-2024) for a $30 “dining voucher” for $20. This is valid only on food, which curiously implies that some people are visiting Chuck E. Cheese for the food. I’ve also seen it appear on food delivery apps as well. I really wonder if there are people hosting parties with stacks of Chuck E. Cheese pizzas to go around…

Speaking of stacks, this should stack with any other Groupon promo code you can find, which is how legendary nice-waterfront-italian-dinner-for-two-for-$5 escapades are made possible.

Most people won't realize their corporate job is dead until they're already replaced. Not just by AI. By someone who spent the last two years learning skills their employer doesn't even know exist yet.

I've been researching this shift for months, diving into books, podcasts, expert interviews, and observing what's actually working in the real economy. The pattern is clear: traditional career paths are collapsing faster than universities can update their curriculums. But here's what nobody talks about: the people thriving right now aren't just ""lucky"" or ""talented."" They're treating self improvement like a full time job.

And honestly? That's exactly what it needs to be.

Here's what I've learned about building a career that actually survives the next decade.

**1. Your resume is becoming worthless, your portfolio is everything**

Companies don't care where you went to school anymore. They care what you can actually do. The shift is brutal but liberating. Traditional credentials are losing value while demonstrable skills are becoming currency.

Start building in public. Write. Create. Document your learning process online. Even if it feels awkward at first, even if nobody's watching. Naval Ravikant talks about this constantly on his podcast, how the internet rewards people who consistently share their knowledge. Your digital footprint becomes your resume.

The gap between ""I have a degree in marketing"" and ""here's the marketing campaign I built that generated $50k in revenue"" is massive. One is a piece of paper. The other is proof.

**2. Become a learning machine or become obsolete**

The half life of skills is shrinking. What you learned five years ago is probably outdated. What you learn today might be irrelevant in three years. This isn't depressing, it's just the game now.

I use an app called Primer for learning new skills in bite sized chunks. marketing, coding, data analysis, whatever. The interface makes it stupid easy to learn during lunch breaks or commutes. But the real trick is applying what you learn immediately. Knowledge without application is just trivia.

BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app built by experts from Columbia University and Google that creates personalized audio content from books, research papers, and expert interviews.

Type in any skill or goal, like improving communication or building better work habits, and it generates a custom podcast with an adaptive learning plan tailored to you.

 The depth control is particularly useful. Start with a 10-minute overview of a topic, and if it clicks, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with detailed examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive, ranging from a smooth, sexy tone like Samantha from Her to more energetic or sarcastic styles depending on your mood. Perfect for commutes or gym sessions when you want to learn without staring at a screen.

Cal Newport's book ""So Good They Can't Ignore You"" destroys the myth of ""follow your passion."" He argues, with tons of research backing it up, that rare and valuable skills create career capital. You become passionate about things you're good at, not the other way around. The book will make you question everything you think you know about career fulfillment. It's
based on Newport's research at MIT and interviews with people who genuinely love their work.

Stop waiting for permission to learn. Your employer isn't going to train you for the future. They're barely keeping up with the present.

**3. Multiple income streams aren't optional anymore**

Relying on one source of income is financial suicide in 2025. Not even being dramatic.Companies are doing layoffs while posting record profits. Job security is a fairy tale our parents believed in.

The creator economy isn't just for influencers. It's for anyone with skills worth sharing. Writing, consulting, digital products, freelancing. You don't need millions of followers. You need 100 people who genuinely value what you offer.

""The $100 Startup"" by Chris Guillebeau breaks down how people are building profitable businesses with minimal investment. Guillebeau spent years studying regular people, not Silicon Valley founders, who created freedom through small scale entrepreneurship. The case studies are insanely practical. It won an award for good reason, it actually tells you HOW instead of just motivating you with vague platitudes.

Start small. Spend evenings building something that could eventually replace your income. It might take years. That time's passing anyway.

**4. Your network is your net worth, but most people network wrong**

Nobody wants to feel like they're being ""networked at."" The transactional coffee meetings where someone clearly just wants something from you. Gross.

Real networking is helping people with zero expectation of return. Sharing resources. Making introductions. Being genuinely interested in other people's work. Then when you need help, people remember you weren't just using them.

Join online communities around your interests. Contribute value first. Comment thoughtfully on people's work. The opportunities come later, naturally, from people who already trust you.

Also, stay off LinkedIn if it makes you feel like shit. Comparing yourself to people's highlight reels is toxic. Build real relationships instead of collecting connections.

**5. Self improvement is infrastructure, not luxury**

Meditation, exercise, reading, therapy. These aren't rewards for success. They're requirements for building anything sustainable. Your brain is the tool you use for everything. When's the last time you actually upgraded it?

I started using Insight Timer for meditation after burning out hard last year. It's free, has guided meditations for literally everything, and the teachers are actual experts, not just wellness influencers. Ten minutes a day made a noticeable difference in like two weeks. Sounds fake but it's not.

James Clear's ""Atomic Habits"" is required reading. It's sold millions of copies because the framework actually works. Clear breaks down the neuroscience of habit formation in a way that's stupidly easy to implement. Small changes compound over time into massive results. This is the best habit book I've ever read, hands down.

Your energy and focus are finite resources. Manage them like you manage money. Sleep isn't negotiable. Neither is moving your body. The hustle culture lie that you need to sacrifice health for success will catch up with you violently.

**6. Productize yourself before someone else does**

Your unique combination of skills, experiences, and perspective is unreplicable. But if you can't articulate your value clearly, you're invisible in the marketplace.

Figure out what you're uniquely good at. Not just skilled at, but the intersection of skills that makes you different. Then communicate that everywhere. Your social media. Your website. Conversations.

""Show Your Work"" by Austin Kleon is a quick read that changed how I think about sharing. Kleon argues that you don't need to be a genius to share your process. People connect with the journey, not just the destination. It's insanely good for anyone scared to put themselves out
there.

The people winning right now aren't necessarily the most talented. They're the ones who are visible and consistent.

**7. The new career path is non linear and that's fine**

You're not going to work at one company for 40 years and retire with a pension. That world is dead. Your career will zigzag. You'll pivot multiple times. Some experiments will fail spectacularly.

This isn't instability, it's adaptability. The most valuable professional trait you can develop is comfort with uncertainty. Getting good at reinventing yourself.

Keep updating your skills. Keep experimenting. Keep building. The worst case scenario is you learn something new and meet interesting people. The upside is you create opportunities that didn't exist before you showed up.

Look, I'm not saying this is easy. Building your own path is harder than following someone else's. But the alternative is depending on systems that are actively crumbling. Corporations that will replace you the second it's profitable. Industries that are being automated while you sleep.

Self improvement isn't selfish anymore. It's survival. The good news is you're already here, already thinking about this. That puts you ahead of most people who are still pretending 2008 never happened and 2020 didn't change everything. 

Your career is yours to build now. Nobody else is coming to save it.",1,1767026754.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False

It’s kind of terrifying.,"Okay, look. I know we see 50 ""I built an AI agent"" posts here every day. Most of them are wrappers that summarize emails. Boring.

But I’ve been working on a project for a US client in the bankruptcy space (post-ZIRP cleanup is real, guys), and I had a genuine ""holy sh\*t"" moment last night that I need to vent/share about.

My client buys assets from bankrupt companies. To find the good stuff, they have paralegals reading thousands of pages of court filings (PDFs) every day. We’re talking messy scans. Coffee stains. Handwriting. Tables that break across 3 pages. A human reads maybe 10 cases a day. Costs \~$40/hour.

**The ""Tech"" (aka The Death of OCR) -** I tried the standard route first: AWS Textract -> Python -> GPT. It failed many times and in total it was too expensive, too many errors with the tables.

Then I switched to **Gemini** inside an **n8n** workflow with **Supabase**. No OCR. Just feeding the raw visual PDF pages to the model.

* **Cost:** dropped from dollars per case to literal pennies (thanks to context caching).
* **Speed:** it processes a 500-page docket in seconds.
* **The scary part:** it’s not just reading, but it’s *reasoning* and calculating the ""success rate""

I caught the AI flagging a ""suspicious transfer"" of a luxury car the debtor sold to his cousin a week before filing. The human team missed it because it was buried in a footnote on page 304. The AI caught it because it ""understood"" the connection between the names.

**So here is my question to you guys -** we are technically at the point where a $20 n8n instance is outperforming a junior analyst with a law degree. I’m charging the client for the ""system,"" but the labor cost effectively went to zero.

For those of you deploying agents in production right now - **are you seeing this level of reasoning in other industries?** Or did I just get lucky with this specific legal dataset?

 Hi everyone, My name is Avi. I’m 16 years old, writing to you from Muzaffarnagar, UP. While you are building your lives in the UK , I am fighting just to start mine. 

When I was 13, I was diagnosed with Aplastic Anemia. It’s a rare condition where the body stops making enough blood cells. Overnight, I went from being a normal kid excited about high school to someone needing weekly blood transfusions and heavy immunosuppressants just to survive. I was learning to deal with that. I was tough. But then, September 2024 happened. 

The Accident. I was in a severe car crash. My right thigh bone shattered. My right shin fractured. My left arm broke. Because of my blood disorder, doctors couldn't perform standard surgery—I would have bled out. Instead, they used external fixators. I currently have metal rods sticking out of my body, holding my bones together from the outside.

 It has been over a year now. My bones still haven't healed. I am bedridden. I watch my friends on Instagram posting about school, tuition, hanging out at cafes, living normal teenage lives. And I’m just... here. In the same bed. Every single day. To make matters worse, I recently tested positive for Hepatitis C—likely from one of the many blood transfusions I’ve needed.

 Why I’m posting here: My family is middle-class, and the medical bills for three simultaneous conditions (The Blood Disorder + The Orthopedic Injuries + Hepatitis C) are crushing us. We have exhausted everything. I'm not writing this for pity.

I’m writing this because I want to fight. I want to walk again. I want to finish 11th grade. I want to make my parents proud. I have started a fundraiser on Ketto to help cover my surgeries and medicines. 

I know the currency is different where you are— £10 might be a coffee for you, but converted to Rupees, it can buy me a day's worth of essential medicine. If you can support a young student back home, or even just upvote this for visibility, it would mean the world to me.

We moved into his home 2 years ago. 

I am miserable and I’ve tried communicating a few times about every issue I’m about to list. Please tell me if I’m unreasonable. 

1. He hardly shows me any affection anymore. Maybe I’ll get a side hug and a couple of pecks a day but that’s because I’ve nagged to create some small routines like saying goodbye before we leave the house and saying goodnight. This is contrasted for me by how often he is spooning, cuddling, and kissing our dogs. 

2. The dogs are spoiled imo and it’s causing overstimulation for me. He allows the dogs on all the furniture and the whole bed not just the foot of the bed. I can’t sit down without being covered in hair and having a furry friend immediately in my face. He also spends a lot of money on special food for them and uses the pots and pans to cook for them but has made 2 meals for us in the past 2 years. He will agree to a compromise like keeping the dogs at the foot of the bed but then immediately bulldoze it and act like I’m the bad guy for trying to enforce it. 

3. One of the dogs is a rescue he adopted a couple of days before I moved in without my agreement. She wasn’t fixed until I threatened to move out because she was free bleeding all over the house and bed. I can’t train her because she will behave in front of me then go back to whatever she wants when she’s with my boyfriend. 

4. The house isn’t up to standards. The floor is unfinished, doors either stick or are missing. We can’t use the dishwasher or oven. The stove top only has two grates and one of them isn’t the proper grate for the range so it rocks. There’s no light in the bedroom (not a bulb issue the actual fixture is broken). We have no tables. He won’t allow a coffee table because he’s afraid of my son or the dogs running into it and getting hurt. He agreed to a kitchen island with bar stools but it’s been 8 months and it hasn’t been fully put together. He doesn’t allow me to pay for professionals to fix anything because he doesn’t want men in his house. 

5. He works maybe 2-3 hours a day 4-5 days a week. We work the same job as independent contractors. It pays well but we are allowed to make our own schedules. Since he works so little he insists we are broke so no vacations, rarely any date nights unless I pay, it’s also his excuse for the houses condition. He’s always home and I never get alone time. He’s goes into work after me and gets off before me, never goes out with friends. I feel a little guilty complaining about this because he pays the mortgage and utilities on his own and he does most of the cleaning but he makes most of the mess. I pay for all the food, emergencies, and activities if we go out.

6. He plays 5-15 hours of Battlefield daily and all hours of the night. The yelling is grating. 

So I’m tired of explaining myself. I’m tired of continuing to be a single parent with another “adult” in the home. I’m tired of being the one who has to handle all emergencies including when he needed another car last year because he doesn’t have savings. I applied to rent a house down the street. I want to move my son, dog, and cat out and let him live the life he obviously likes with his dog without dragging me onto his weird chosen poverty. We were friends for so long before we got together. I’m so hurt he could treat me like this. Maybe I’m being picky. Maybe it’s my fault. Idk but I need clean functional space and quiet to even figure anything else out. When I told him he was very sad and told me I haven’t even thought of what this will do to my dog and my son and that I’m separating our family. He’s not going to hurt me for leaving… I have a history of abuse so this is all confusing for me. I think I need to do this to be a decent mother to both my son and my pets. I’m a shell of myself.

1pyr1wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1pyr1wi/the_sciencebased_speed_reading_guide_how_to_read/,The Science-Based SPEED READING Guide: How to Read Faster and Actually Remember More,"I used to be that person who bought books with good intentions, read 20 pages, then let them collect dust for months. Sound familiar? The problem wasn't motivation. It was the fact that traditional reading felt painfully slow for my brain's processing speed. After diving deep into research from cognitive scientists, productivity experts, and yes, speed reading champions, I've completely transformed how I consume books. Now I'm finishing 2-3 books weekly while actually retaining what I read. Here's everything that actually works.

1. Stop subvocalizing (this alone will double your speed)

Your inner voice is sabotaging you. Most people read at talking speed because they're essentially ""saying"" each word in their head. This caps you at around 250 words per minute when your brain can actually process information WAY faster.

The fix is weirdly simple. Use a pointer (your finger, a pen, whatever) to guide your eyes across the page faster than you can subvocalize. Your brain will panic for like 30 seconds then adapt. Cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene explains in his research that our brains recognize word shapes and patterns, not individual letters. You're literally capable of reading 3x faster once you break the subvocalization habit.
I started with 10 minute practice sessions using random articles online. Push your pointer slightly faster than comfortable. It feels chaotic at first but your comprehension catches up within a week.

2. Read in chunks, not words

Elite speed readers don't read word by word. They're taking in 3-5 word chunks per eye fixation. This is called ""expanding your peripheral vision span"" and it's trainable.

Here's the practical approach. When you read, focus on the middle of phrases rather than the beginning. Your peripheral vision automatically captures the surrounding words. Instead of reading ""the quick brown fox"" as four separate fixations, you're absorbing it as one visual chunk.
Tim Ferriss breaks this down brilliantly in his speed reading experiments. He went from 450 to 900+ words per minute in one sitting using this technique. The key is training your eyes to stop making unnecessary movements. Most people fixate on every single word plus make tiny regressions backward. That's wildly inefficient.

Practice by drawing vertical lines down book pages to create narrower text columns. This forces your eyes into chunk reading mode.

3. Preview before deep reading (the 80/20 of books)

Not every page deserves equal attention. This sounds obvious but most people read books linearly from page 1 to the end, giving identical focus to everything.

Smart readers preview first. Spend 10 minutes skimming the table of contents, introduction, chapter summaries, and conclusion before actually reading. This creates a mental framework that makes the detailed reading SO much faster because your brain already knows where the information fits.

Mortimer Adler's ""How to Read a Book"" (legitimately one of the most mind shifting books on reading itself, won the Phi Beta Kappa Award) introduces ""inspectional reading"" as a crucial step most people skip. You're basically answering ""what is this book about?"" and ""what is its structure?"" before diving deep. This makes the actual reading feel like filling in details rather than discovering from scratch.For non fiction, I preview then decide which chapters actually matter for my goals. Fiction obviously needs linear reading but even then, understanding the book's structure upfront helps.

 4. Ditch the highlighter, use active recall instead

Highlighting feels productive but it's mostly performance. Research from psychologist Henry Roediger shows that passive review (rereading, highlighting) is one of the LEAST effective learning methods.
What actually works is active recall. After finishing a chapter, close the book and write down everything you remember. No peeking. This retrieval practice is what burns information into long term memory.

I use an app called Notion to create quick book summaries as I read. Just bullet points of key concepts in my own words. The act of translating the author's language into mine forces deeper processing. Takes an extra 5 minutes per chapter but multiplies retention by like 10x.
Another approach is the Feynman Technique. Explain what you just read out loud like you're teaching it to someone who knows nothing about the topic. If you stumble, that's exactly what you need to reread.

 5. Read multiple books simultaneously (sounds crazy, actually genius)

This goes against conventional wisdom but reading 3-5 books at once has made me a faster, better reader. Different books for different mental states and contexts.
I typically have a challenging non fiction book (business, psychology, whatever), a lighter skill building book, and fiction going at the same time. When my brain is fried from work, I'm not forcing myself through dense material. I switch to fiction. Morning commute? That's for the skill building book.

Shane Parrish from Farnam Street (incredible podcast and blog about decision making and mental models btw) talks about how this approach prevents burnout and keeps reading feeling fresh. You're never stuck in one author's voice or perspective for too long.

Plus your brain makes unexpected connections between different books. I was reading ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" alongside a marketing book and suddenly understood consumer behavior on a completely different level.

6. Strategic skimming isn't cheating, it's smart

Some sections of books are redundant or irrelevant to your goals. Give yourself permission to skim or skip.

Most non fiction follows a pattern. Each chapter introduces a concept, gives 3-5 examples/stories, then summarizes. Once you grasp the concept, you can often skim the examples unless they're particularly illustrative. This easily cuts 30% of reading time without losing the core insights.

Paul Edwards' ""How to Read Faster and Better"" (classic from a Cornell professor who literally taught speed reading courses) emphasizes that skilled readers constantly adjust their speed based on content density. You should be flying through transitional paragraphs and examples you already understand, then slowing down for complex new ideas.

Fiction is different because language and pacing matter. But even there, some descriptive passages can be skimmed if the plot is what you're after.For those wanting another layer of efficiency, there's BeFreed, an AI learning app founded by Columbia alumni and ex-Google engineers. Type in what you want to learn, your specific goals or struggles, and it generates personalized audio podcasts from verified sources like research papers, expert interviews, and books. 

You control the depth too, switching between a 10-minute overview or a 40-minute deep dive with examples when something really clicks. The app also builds an adaptive learning plan that evolves based on your progress and what you highlight. There's even a virtual coach called Freedia that you can pause mid-session to ask questions or get clarifications. It's been useful for reinforcing concepts from books or exploring topics that don't have a dedicated book yet.

7. Fix your reading environment (underrated game changer)

Your physical setup massively impacts reading speed and focus. Most people read in whatever random position is comfortable, which actually creates unnecessary eye strain and fatigue.

Optimal setup is holding the book at a 45 degree angle about 15-18 inches from your eyes. This reduces the distance your eyes travel and minimizes neck strain. Sounds nitpicky but it genuinely matters for sustained reading sessions.

Lighting is huge too. You want bright, even lighting that doesn't create glare on the page. I got a cheap LED reading light from Amazon and it made night reading SO much easier on my eyes.
Also, eliminate distractions. Put your phone in another room. Close the laptop. Tell your brain this is dedicated reading time. The Pomodoro method works great. 25 minutes of focused reading, 5 minute break. Your concentration and speed both improve when you're not fighting the urge to check notifications every 90 seconds.

8. Build the actual habit (techniques mean nothing without consistency)

All these techniques are worthless if you don't read regularly. The speed and comprehension improvements compound over time.
Start stupidly small. James Clear's ""Atomic Habits"" (multi million copy bestseller, the guy basically decoded how habits actually form based on neuroscience and behavioral psychology, genuinely transformative read) suggests making new habits so easy you can't say no. Don't commit to reading 50 pages daily. Commit to reading ONE page.

Sounds ridiculous but it removes the activation energy barrier. Once you've read one page, you'll usually keep going. But even if you don't, you've maintained the identity of ""someone who reads daily"" which is what matters for long term habit formation.
I linked my reading habit to existing routines. Morning coffee always comes with 15 minutes of reading. Lunch break means another 10-15 minutes. These small pockets add up to 30-60 minutes daily without feeling like a massive time commitment.

Track your progress visually. I use an app called Bookly that shows reading streaks and pages per day. Seeing that streak number climb creates psychological momentum. Stupid simple but it works.The speed reading techniques accelerate how much you absorb during those reading windows. But the habit is what transforms you from someone who wants to read more into someone who actually does.

Look, nobody's becoming a 1000 words per minute speed demon overnight. But doubling your current speed while improving retention is absolutely achievable in 2-3 weeks of consistent practice. Start with one technique, master it, then add another. Your future self will thank you for all the knowledge you're about to unlock.",1,1767026490.0,MenWithDiscipline,0,1.0,False

Somewhat wistful, self-examining, optimistic. I'm also trying to decide if I'm a sex addict, so yeah... anyway, I have been writing about my various trysts and full-blown relationships over the last several years and I thought I might share. It's decent discussion fodder, I think, but obviously for a very particular audience.

One month into covid, as I stood outside a restaurant waiting for my order, I started to exchange messages with a woman I found very attractive, though she didn't live very close to me. This was on AFF, a platform I found irritating and disappointing for actually meeting, but often entertaining and even arousing. We clicked. She's three hours away, but we had a lot in common and there was a mutual attraction. Over the next year, we texted often, exchanging spicy photos and talking through some pretty serious personal moments. We both experienced the loss of loved ones and had career crises. She became a true friend.

We had a few near-miss meetups over that year, with each of us traveling to the other's city, but unable to put our schedules together. Finally, she showed up in my town in March 2020 and we met at her hotel. Looking into her eyes fact-to-face was amazing. She asked me to meet in the lobby of her hotel and it took a lot of self control to chat for even 5 minutes before we headed up to her room. She was having some knee pain and was very apologetic for not being able to be on top or on her knees and I kept having to reassure her that I was enjoying myself immensely. The first session was intense and fast and covered a lot of bases. Then we laid in bed and chatted for a while, carressing and holding each other. Round 2 was much more sensual and sweet and it truly was one of those moments where I thought, ""what if I went home right now and packed a bag and left with this person?""

Reality interevened, of course, and we again went months without being able to connect. In that time, she separated from her SO and that made for some awkwardness between us. I wasn't able to just drop my life like she was and she was a little resentful. Regardless, we met up that summer and had a date-like experience (great dinner out, long walk, PDA) followed again by wonderful and intimate sex. But she was headed for divorce and another family crisis and we drifted apart. I had coffee with her over the summer and we shared a long kiss at her car, but neither of us were able to break away for anthing more. We still exchange texts and voice notes every month or two and it's possible we will reignite this, but I fear it's over.

I tried to diagnose, and when looking at a water purge with no portafilter I see the flow is pretty uneven (big streams) and not “shower-like” as I remember it last week. Not sure if I’ve damaged anything or if this is expected, but thought I’d ask.

We sorta hung out at my place and drank some tea and coffee (I’m not much of a drinker so I don’t keep alcohol at my place) for a little while (mostly because I just took forever to get ready lolol). Then we decided to go out to this gay bar for a night of dancing (all of us are LGBTQ in some sort of way). 

We got into the bar without much of an issue, I drank a total of 3 drinks (1 shot of tequila and two Red Bull vodkas). I think this is a fairly reasonable and moderate amount of alcohol to drink at a bar, and while I was a little tipsy I was far from drunk or anything. All I did was dance some and be silly with my friends. Literally nothing aggressive or dangerous or anything. The tequila shot was actually free from the bartender for my bday (as an example of how little of a problem he thought I was). 

Anyway as I said I’m not much of a drinker and I often feel really vulnerable if I drink too much, especially because I do have some significant mobility issues, and I am liable to fall easily. I have a noticeable limp and I lose my balance regularly due to three gunshot wounds in my legs and flank a couple years ago. One of the bullets went through my sciatic nerve bundle in my hip and is still lodged in my spine. I lose my balance and stumble a lot as a normal part of my life, not in connection with any alcohol use. And I did not feel like I had been stumbling any more than usual that night (notably I didn’t fall at all during the night).

However, around 1am I went outside to get some air and sorta just have some time alone with this guy I was talking to. When we turned to go back in they wouldn’t let us (allegedly because he had broken bar rules by bringing a drink out with him). He dumped out the drink and asked to go back in. They let him in but wouldn’t let me in. When I asked why they just said they couldn’t let me in. They gave literally no explanation or any example of anything I might have done to explain why they couldn’t let me into the bar. So the guy went on in bc I mean idk. I guess that was sorta an asshole move but his friends were still in there. None of my friends knew I was outside. So I had to stand on the street, in a very busy neighborhood with lots of drunk people running around, in a dress that like fully showed my ass and tits and was sparkly as fuck, by myself basically just pouring tears uncontrollably because I felt so humiliated. The only possible reason I can think of for why they wouldn’t let me in is bc they thought that I was too drunk or something because I had probably stumbled at some point or lost my balance a little walking out. Which just feels like blatant ableism (I tried explaining to them that I’m disabled but they either didn’t care or didn’t believe me…). 

Eventually my friends came looking for me, but it sucked so much and I felt so discriminated against. I know I probably should have brought my cane bc then maybe they would have believed me more about the disability, but idk… I kinda feel like they still would have tried to kick me out… and also I feel like I shouldn’t have to bring my cane places if I don’t need to (if for example I have people I can lean on instead) just to prove my disability to people. Like that sucks… 

Idk. Just sad and frustrated and angry and feeling marginalized. Has anyone else experienced something like this before? Is there a way without bringing my cane of like signaling that I have a disability to bar staff who might jump to the conclusion that I’m drunk or something because I’m a little prone to stumbling?",11,1767026375.0,disability,2,0.87,False

Laila, my best friend and long-time chaos anchor, leaned across the desk with her usual iced coffee and a raised brow “You’re legit about to shoot lasers at him.” 

“Oh, I wish I could do more.” I flung the paper onto my desk like it had personally betrayed me. 

Laila stifled a laugh. “It’s just one point, Em. You still got the second-highest score.” 

“That only makes it worse!” I hissed, glaring at the red ink like it mocked me. “If it were anyone else, fine. I’d shrug it off. But it’s him.” 

“Atlas Lawson,” Laila said dreamily, her eyes glued to him like he was the sun incarnate. Sadly, my beautiful friend had also fallen blindly into the trap of his looks, which, by the way, I still thought was nothing far from average (okay, maybe I lied). 

I rolled my eyes. “The bane of my high school existence.” 

She sipped her iced coffee and didn’t even try to hide her grin. “He doesn’t even talk to anyone, Em. Maybe he’s not evil. Just… socially constipated.” 

“He smiled, Laila.” 

“Oh, the audacity.” 

I dropped my forehead to the desk and groaned. “Why couldn’t he be dumb? Or ugly? Or… I don’t know, allergic to pencils?” 

Laila chuckled, reaching over to pat my back. “You’re spiraling again.” 

I didn’t reply. I just let my cheek press against the cold desk, eyes peeking over the edge at him. 

Atlas was now stretching, arms over his head, muscles flexing under his stupid black hoodie like he was in some sportswear ad. 

God. 

I hate him. 

I hate him so freaking bad. 

And the worst part? 

This was only Monday.

I don’t usually hate people. 

In fact, I love everyone. 

I’m that girl. The one who volunteers on weekends, bottle-feeds ick puppies, bakes cookies for bake sales, and organizes food drives like it’s a competitive sport.

He walked into school wearing that hoodie pulled up, hair slightly damp, bag slung over one shoulder like he couldn’t care less. Every girl in a 30-foot radius physically stopped breathing. But not me. No, I was on a mission to be kind. 

I approached him at the vending machines. 

“Word of advice,” I’d said with a sunny grin, tilting my head toward the machine, “unless you’re into stomach cramps, avoid the tuna sandwich.” 

He blinked at me. 

Didn’t laugh. 

Didn’t smile. 

Didn’t even nod. 

Just walked right past me. 

At first, I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he didn’t hear me? Maybe he was having a rough day? But every time after that, every joke, every smile, every attempt to be even slightly human to him, he ignored me. 

But here’s the thing about me: I don’t give up. 

The more he pushed me away, the more I was determined to break through that arctic wall of broody silence. 

So, after one of his hockey games where he’d scored the winning goal and the crowd was practically chanting his name, I decided to be the bigger person. I waited by the locker exit, holding a small white box tied with a blue ribbon. 

Homemade chocolate chip cookies. Still warm. 

I even wrapped them in tissue paper with hockey stick stickers. Im not a monster. 

He stepped out, hair still wet from the shower, jersey slung over one shoulder. His eyes met mine briefly, and I forced the kindest, brightest, most Emery Collins smile I could manage. 

“Hey,” I said cheerfully, stepping forward. “That was insane, you rushed it. I baked these. For you.” 

He looked at the box. 

Then at me. 

Then said, “No, thank you.” 

And walked away. 

My smile faltered. My stomach twisted.

“Did I do something to you?” I asked louder. Now people were turning to look like I was crazy but at this point I couldn’t care less. 

He stared at me, calm and unreadable. “No.” 

“Then why do you act like I’m this massive pain in your ass? I’ve cracked jokes, offered you my pen, saved you a seat in homeroom. I even helped you find your locker when you got lost that day, and you didn’t even say thank you. I’ve tried, Atlas. I’ve really tried to be your friend.” 

His jaw ticked. His voice was low, cold. “I never asked you to be my friend.” 

I blinked. “Excuse me?” 

He folded his arms, tone sharp but even. “Look, I don’t want to be part of your little Miss Princess Act.” 

I stepped back like I’d been slapped. “Miss Princess, what?” 

“You don’t have to make everyone like you. You don’t have to pretend to be kind just to feel good about yourself.” 

My throat tightened, heart slamming against my ribs, my hand sill holding the damn cookie box like a trophy of humiliation. 

People were watching. Whispering. 

And he just turned and walked away. 

No. 

No freaking way he was going to walk away after embarrassing me like that. 

“Atlas!” I yelled. 

He stopped mid-step. 

I stormed up to him and shoved the box into his chest, hard enough that he had to grab it. 

“Fine,” I snapped. “You don’t want to be friends? Great. Amazing. But mark my words, I’m going to crush you. On the track, 

in the classroom, wherever I see you…I’m coming for the crown And you can thrash the cookies if you want to.” 

Then I turned on my heel and walked off like a girl on fire. 

I didn’t look back. 

But I really hoped he choked on the smell of chocolate chip cookies. 

And that, right there, that embarrassing cookie moment in the hallway was the very beginning of my downfall. 

Because, as much as I wanted to write Atlas Lawson off as a one-me nuisance, the universe had other plans. Evil, well- packaged, six-foot-two plans with annoyingly good cheekbones and an even more annoyingly high IQ.

Turns out, Atlas stupid, annoying jerk-face Lawson wasn’t just a ockey prodigy with lips wornen would write songs about. 

Nope. 

He was smart. 

So smart, in fact, that he managed to do the unthinkable, push e to second place in our final GPA rankings. 

SECOND place! 

Me. 

That had never happened. Not in Preschool, not in Elementary school, not in middle school, and certainly not in my entire four years of high-functioning, overachieving, anxiety-powered high school life. 

And now, on graduation day, I sat there in my cap and gown, clapping like a good little graduate while the Dean called out 

his name. 

“And now, it’s my honor to recognize the student who has achieved the highest academic distinction in the graduating class of 2024. This year’s Valedictorian, with the highest cumulative GPA, is Atlas Lawson!” 

Cue the thunderous applause. 

I rolled my eyes so hard I swear I saw the inside of my

Walking across the stage like he owned the damn planet. The crowd loved it. Even the parents behind me murmured, “he’s so handsome” and “what a bright young man.” 

Barf. 

Gag me with a diploma. 

But no. I wasn’t going to let him ruin this moment. This was my graduation too. And I had other things to be happy about… real things. 

Like my amazing friends. 

My loyal boyfriend Kevin. 

My bright, glittering future. 

And most importantly… 

“There’s my little golden locks!” 

I turned just in time to be swept into a bear hug. 

“Dad,” I laughed as he spun me gently and then set me back on the ground. 

“I’m so proud of you, baby,” he said, his voice thick. “And I know your mom would be too.” 

My chest squeezed, and I smiled through it, gripping his arms thtly. “Thanks, Dad.” 

We pulled apart, and he wiped his eyes like he wasn’t totally getting emotional, which meant I was definitely getting emotional. But before I could say anything else, his face lit up, ad he turned. 

“Oh! There he is, the man of the hour.”

“Mr. Sinclair, I’ll marry you,” Sophia Fraley slurred. She’d just killed half a bottle of vodka, and her tongue felt three sizes too big. 

A long silence answered her. Then a deep, sleepy voice came through, irritation clear beneath the gravel. “You even know what time it is?” 

She squinted at her phone and finally saw two in the morning. “Sorry. I’ll call tomorrow.” 

“Okay,” Henry Sinclair muttered. 

She blinked. “Wait, what?” 

“I’ll leave on a business trip in the morning. Back in four weeks. We’ll sign the papers then,” he said. 

“Oh… okay.” 

The line clicked off. Sophia stared at the screen, her head spinning. 

Two weeks earlier, her aunt Amanda, who lived in a distant small town, had called. 

She said, “Belinda, the old lady next door, she’s got this perfect grandson, Henry. Honors student, decent college, city job, dental plan, and even Christmas bonuses. I think maybe I can see you guys up.” 

Sophia agreed to shut her up, planning to ghost. 

That same night, however, Henry phoned. “No time for blind dates or small talk,” he’d said. “If you’re up for it, let’s skip straight to the courthouse.” 

‘Is this guy nuts?’ she wondered, blindsided. 

He didn’t wait for an answer. “Sleep on it,” he said, and the line went dead. 

She hadn’t thought about it once, until tonight, drunk and lonely she dialed. 

Sophia flicked through her phone, and the internet was still losing it. The NO.1 on the feed: Charlotte Wynn, A-list queen. knocked up. And the guy everyone swore was the father was Richard Lane, the married leading man. 

The “home-wrecker” hashtags were flying when Andrew Carter, he Carter Group’s spare heir, suddenly jumped in. 

He posted: \[She’s my girl, the baby’s mine, and we’re walking down the aisle. Chill.\] 

Skeptics kept clapping back, so Andrew dropped a clip from Charlotte’s last birthday: him on one knee, ring box open, and her squealing yes. 

Overnight, the comment section flipped to heart-emojis and champagne gifs. 

Now the top tag was simply: \[Charlotte’s marrying Andrew Cartel 

Sophia stared at the screen, half-laughing, half-sick. T’m his girlfriend, and he’s out there proposing to someone else? Eight years, and I don’t even get a goodbye text. Fine. Time to bail before the joke’s on me 

And Henry had said it so casually on the phone: “I just want the gular deal. Have each other’s backs, stay cool, and grow gray together. That single sentence sold her.

Boring, maybe, but it sounded like heaven. Andrew had never even once offered her a boring promise. 

She took a breath and then yanked her suitcase from the closet. The villa was in Andrew’s name, she was only a visitor who’d overstayed. Time to ghost before the happy couple came home. 

Sophia had an early shift, so she’d only grabbed a couple of hours of sleep before dragging herself downstairs. 

Andrew was spread across the couch, hair wrecked, brows pinched like the liquor still had a grip. 

She side-stepped the mess and started making breakfast. 

While the coffee brewed, Andrew shuffled into the kitchen, breath still boozy, and draped himself over her shoulders. 

He muttered. “Babe, my head’s splitting. Make me that hangover drink, yeah?” 

Sophia frowned, “Go sit on the couch. I’ll be there in two minutes.” 

“But I wanna stay with you,” he mumbled, his eyes still closed. 

“You smell awful,” she said, wrinkling her nose. 

“Really?” He sniffed his shirt and grimaced. “Okay, shower first.” 

She filled the blender with ice, a fistful of fresh mint, orange juice, a big squeeze of honey, and a pinch of salt. It was the homemade reset button she kept ready for his late-night client dinners. 

The machine buzzed. The sound dragged her straight back to every other morning-after. ‘Eight years of curing his hangover; zero years of curing his wandering eye, she laughed under her breath. ‘Fine. Last batch. Period at the end of the relationship.’ 

By the time he padded downstairs, the glass was sweating on the counter. He pressed the cold rim to his temple, took a slow sip of the minty honey slush, and didn’t offer a word about last night. 

“Congrats,” she said. 

“For what?” He looked up, blank. 

“After so many years of birthday proposals, Charlotte finally took the bait,” she said calmly. 

She had always known about Charlotte. The crush had lasted fifteen years, ever since junior high. On every single birthday, Andrew dropped to one knee and proposed. He never missed one, not even during the eight years he spent with Sophia. 

‘Of course I care. The thought tasted bitter, but she had loved him enough to play the fool. 

Andrew frowned. “You saw the feed?” 

Sophia just looked at him, saying nothing. 

It’s PR,’ he said, like he was reading the weather. “Once the noise dies down, we file for divorce. Chill.” 

She scoffed, “PR So you’re actually getting a marriage license and throwing a real wedding?” 

“Of course, he replied. “Otherwise, my family would never buy 

“Then how is that just PR? You’re getting married,” she shot back 

“It’s fake, alright? Quit digging,” he muttered, downing the last of the smoothie and heading upstairs.

“I don’t want to referee whatever circus you and Charlotte haveing.” Sophia said, “but you and I still need to close our books.” 

Andrew turned and stared at her. “Close what books?” 

She drew a slow breath. “We’re done. I’m out.” 

“Are you even listening?” he barked. “The wedding is staged. We untie it the second the cameras leave. Why the drama? This doesn’t touch you. Just play dumb and wait it out. You need the attention that bad?” 

Have you ever paid any attention to me at all?’ The thought stung. “Real or staged, I’m out,” she said, voice level. “We’re over, Andrew.” 

“Sophia,” he barked. 

Tm exhausted.” She shut her eyes. “Eight years of loving you has emptied the tank. That’s enough. I’m out.” 

“Fine, walk! Just don’t come crawling back.” He snatched his coat and slammed the door. 

Silence. For the first time, Sophia felt the weight slide off her shoulders and stay gone. 

Sophia was an OB-GYN at Carter Hospital. She got to her office early and juggled patients while Maggie, the nurse, rattled off the latest gossip. 

Maggie sighed, “So whose baby is Charlotte really carrying? First it was Richard, and now it’s Andrew. If it were me, I’d pick Andrew. He’s loaded and crazy-hot. 

“Plus, he’s been hung up on her for fifteen straight years. That’s. Ike, lifetime-movie devotion.” 

Sophia couldn’t take any more. She told Maggie to take one of the moms-to-be upstairs for her exam. 

She’d barely sat down when Andrew called. He demanded, “Clear your schedule. Charlotte’s coming in for her prenatal

“Fine,” I snapped. “You don’t want to be friends? Great. Amazing. But mark my words, I’m going to crush you. On the track, 

in the classroom, wherever I see you…I’m coming for the crown And you can thrash the cookies if you want to.” 

Then I turned on my heel and walked off like a girl on fire. 

I didn’t look back. 

But I really hoped he choked on the smell of chocolate chip cookies. 

And that, right there, that embarrassing cookie moment in the hallway was the very beginning of my downfall. 

Because, as much as I wanted to write Atlas Lawson off as a one-me nuisance, the universe had other plans. Evil, well- packaged, six-foot-two plans with annoyingly good cheekbones and an even more annoyingly high IQ.

Turns out, Atlas stupid, annoying jerk-face Lawson wasn’t just a ockey prodigy with lips wornen would write songs about. 

Nope. 

He was smart. 

So smart, in fact, that he managed to do the unthinkable, push e to second place in our final GPA rankings. 

SECOND place! 

Me. 

That had never happened. Not in Preschool, not in Elementary school, not in middle school, and certainly not in my entire four years of high-functioning, overachieving, anxiety-powered high school life. 

And now, on graduation day, I sat there in my cap and gown, clapping like a good little graduate while the Dean called out 

his name. 

“And now, it’s my honor to recognize the student who has achieved the highest academic distinction in the graduating class of 2024. This year’s Valedictorian, with the highest cumulative GPA, is Atlas Lawson!” 

Cue the thunderous applause. 

I rolled my eyes so hard I swear I saw the inside of my

skull. 

Walking across the stage like he owned the damn planet. The crowd loved it. Even the parents behind me murmured, “he’s so handsome” and “what a bright young man.” 

Barf. 

Gag me with a diploma. 

But no. I wasn’t going to let him ruin this moment. This was my graduation too. And I had other things to be happy about… real things. 

Like my amazing friends. 

My loyal boyfriend Kevin. 

My bright, glittering future. 

And most importantly… 

“There’s my little golden locks!” 

I turned just in time to be swept into a bear hug. 

“Dad,” I laughed as he spun me gently and then set me back on the ground. 

“I’m so proud of you, baby,” he said, his voice thick. “And I know your mom would be too.” 

My chest squeezed, and I smiled through it, gripping his arms thtly. “Thanks, Dad.” 

We pulled apart, and he wiped his eyes like he wasn’t totally getting emotional, which meant I was definitely getting emotional. But before I could say anything else, his face lit up, ad he turned. 

“Oh! There he is, the man of the hour.”

To Atlas.

No. No no no no no. 

And then I remembered. 

Oh yeah. 

The one tiny, soul-crushing detail I conveniently forgot to mention: 

My dad is dating Atlas Lawson’s mom. 

Yup. 

Let that marinate. 

My actual father. 

Dating the mother of my academic nemesis. 

The human migraine that has haunted my educational career. 

The universe really does hate me.

If you have more you know please share! I don’t read a lot of MF so it’s limited.

Some notes beforehand:

1. Trans men’s bodies vary in these books. They may not have had bottom surgery or top surgery. 
2. This list includes a couple of books with trans men who are verse, not just “strict tops”. 
3. Make sure to check content notes and warnings! Keep yourself safe. 
4. Not all books are high spice. Some may only have one or two sex scenes.

1pyqw16,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1pyqw16/not_so_residential/,Not So Residential,"Our family booked a Residence Inn near our hometown to stay while we visited family over the holiday. We choose the RI since we’ll be in town for 10 days and have our dog. It’s been a couple years since we did this and boy did the changes we encountered suck!

An extended stay room with no storage? Doesn’t make sense - but to Marriott it does. There were no dressers, drawers or shelves for clothing. The two drawers in the closet had the extra bedding and pillow. Sure we could take them out - but where would we put them?

No luggage stands/racks either.

The tv was in the corner by the balcony door. Directly across from the desk and completely out of natural view of the couch. There was no way to move or adjust the tv. If you sat all the way on the one side of the couch and turned your head 45 degrees, you could see the tv. 

The bedroom door opens into the corner of the bed. The bathroom door opens into the toilet. You have to go into the bathroom and stand behind the door in the corner to close it, the you can step over to the toilet. No shelving in the shower for toiletries. 

Shower head was a sad excuse for plumbing. It had two settings - harsh enough to remove flesh and too soft to rinse a beetle. 

At some point our room had water damage because we could see where the bubbling ceiling had been poorly repaired and painted over. The brown ceiling tiles outside our room were also a clue.

The kitchen cupboards were falling off and the space under the sink looked like a biohazard site. 

We never saw housekeeping. Despite leaving notices at the front desk. We took out our own trash. No recycling anywhere for plastic bottles and soda cans. I ended up getting a swiffer for our room.

The mattress was stained with coffee (at least I hope it was coffee). There’s no way this wasn’t noticed before giving us our room, since the fitted sheet wasn’t really fitted and you could see the entire side of the mattress with it on. When we mentioned it we were told there weren’t any other rooms. Yeah. 

Our balcony lights didn’t work. When we asked about it we were told they didn’t know how - but “they should come on” (they never did).

On top of all of this, they charged us twice - because they created a duplicate reservation when correcting my maiden name.

We won’t be booking again. Dirty rooms and no storage for an extended stay are just egregious neglect, IMO.",6,1767026125.0,marriott,2,1.0,False

“Okay,” Henry Sinclair muttered. 

She blinked. “Wait, what?” 

“I’ll leave on a business trip in the morning. Back in four weeks. We’ll sign the papers then,” he said.

She said, “Belinda, the old lady next door, she’s got this perfect grandson, Henry. Honors student, decent college, city job, dental plan, and even Christmas bonuses. I think maybe I can see you guys up.” 

Sophia agreed to shut her up, planning to ghost. 

That same night, however, Henry phoned. “No time for blind dates or small talk,” he’d said. “If you’re up for it, let’s skip straight to the courthouse.” 

‘Is this guy nuts?’ she wondered, blindsided. 

He didn’t wait for an answer. “Sleep on it,” he said, and the line went dead.

Boring, maybe, but it sounded like heaven. Andrew had never even once offered her a boring promise. 

She took a breath and then yanked her suitcase from the closet. The villa was in Andrew’s name, she was only a visitor who’d overstayed. Time to ghost before the happy couple came home. 

Sophia had an early shift, so she’d only grabbed a couple of hours of sleep before dragging herself downstairs. 

Andrew was spread across the couch, hair wrecked, brows pinched like the liquor still had a grip. 

She side-stepped the mess and started making breakfast. 

While the coffee brewed, Andrew shuffled into the kitchen, breath still boozy, and draped himself over her shoulders. 

He muttered. “Babe, my head’s splitting. Make me that hangover drink, yeah?” 

Sophia frowned, “Go sit on the couch. I’ll be there in two minutes.” 

“But I wanna stay with you,” he mumbled, his eyes still closed. 

“You smell awful,” she said, wrinkling her nose. 

“Really?” He sniffed his shirt and grimaced. “Okay, shower first.” 

She filled the blender with ice, a fistful of fresh mint, orange juice, a big squeeze of honey, and a pinch of salt. It was the homemade reset button she kept ready for his late-night client dinners. 

The machine buzzed. The sound dragged her straight back to every other morning-after. ‘Eight years of curing his hangover; zero years of curing his wandering eye, she laughed under her breath. ‘Fine. Last batch. Period at the end of the relationship.’ 

By the time he padded downstairs, the glass was sweating on the counter. He pressed the cold rim to his temple, took a slow sip of the minty honey slush, and didn’t offer a word about last night. 

“Congrats,” she said. 

“For what?” He looked up, blank. 

“After so many years of birthday proposals, Charlotte finally took the bait,” she said calmly. 

She had always known about Charlotte. The crush had lasted fifteen years, ever since junior high. On every single birthday, Andrew dropped to one knee and proposed. He never missed one, not even during the eight years he spent with Sophia. 

‘Of course I care. The thought tasted bitter, but she had loved him enough to play the fool. 

Andrew frowned. “You saw the feed?” 

Sophia just looked at him, saying nothing. 

It’s PR,’ he said, like he was reading the weather. “Once the noise dies down, we file for divorce. Chill.”

“Are you even listening?” he barked. “The wedding is staged. We untie it the second the cameras leave. Why the drama? This doesn’t touch you. Just play dumb and wait it out. You need the attention that bad?”

I didn’t realize I was burning holes into the side of his head until he looked up. 

Our eyes met. 

His lips twitched. 

A smile. 

A small, smug, soul-crushing smile. 

And then he turned to his friend and said something that made im laugh.

Laila, my best friend and long-time chaos anchor, leaned across the desk with her usual iced coffee and a raised brow “You’re legit about to shoot lasers at him.” 

“Oh, I wish I could do more.” I flung the paper onto my desk like it had personally betrayed me. 

Laila stifled a laugh. “It’s just one point, Em. You still got the second-highest score.” 

“That only makes it worse!” I hissed, glaring at the red ink like it mocked me. “If it were anyone else, fine. I’d shrug it off. But it’s him.” 

“Atlas Lawson,” Laila said dreamily, her eyes glued to him like he was the sun incarnate. Sadly, my beautiful friend had also fallen blindly into the trap of his looks, which, by the way, I still thought was nothing far from average (okay, maybe I lied). 

I rolled my eyes. “The bane of my high school existence.” 

She sipped her iced coffee and didn’t even try to hide her grin. “He doesn’t even talk to anyone, Em. Maybe he’s not evil. Just… socially constipated.” 

“He smiled, Laila.” 

“Oh, the audacity.” 

I dropped my forehead to the desk and groaned. “Why couldn’t he be dumb? Or ugly? Or… I don’t know, allergic to pencils?” 

Laila chuckled, reaching over to pat my back. “You’re spiraling again.” 

I didn’t reply. I just let my cheek press against the cold desk, eyes peeking over the edge at him. 

Atlas was now stretching, arms over his head, muscles flexing under his stupid black hoodie like he was in some sportswear ad. 

God. 

I hate him. 

I hate him so freaking bad. 

And the worst part? 

This was only Monday.

I don’t usually hate people. 

In fact, I love everyone. 

I’m that girl. The one who volunteers on weekends, bottle-feeds ick puppies, bakes cookies for bake sales, and organizes food drives like it’s a competitive sport. I’m the “teacher’s favorite,” the “golden girl,” the one with the heart of gold, as Mrs. Benson once said while dabbing tears from her eyes at the spring award ceremony.

He walked into school wearing that hoodie pulled up, hair slightly damp, bag slung over one shoulder like he couldn’t care less. Every girl in a 30-foot radius physically stopped breathing. But not me. No, I was on a mission to be kind. 

I approached him at the vending machines. 

“Word of advice,” I’d said with a sunny grin, tilting my head toward the machine, “unless you’re into stomach cramps, avoid the tuna sandwich.” 

He blinked at me. 

Didn’t laugh. 

Didn’t smile. 

Didn’t even nod. 

Just walked right past me. 

At first, I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he didn’t hear me? Maybe he was having a rough day? But every time after that, every joke, every smile, every attempt to be even slightly human to him, he ignored me. 

But here’s the thing about me: I don’t give up. 

The more he pushed me away, the more I was determined to break through that arctic wall of broody silence. 

So, after one of his hockey games where he’d scored the winning goal and the crowd was practically chanting his name, I decided to be the bigger person. I waited by the locker exit, holding a small white box tied with a blue ribbon. 

Homemade chocolate chip cookies. Still warm. 

I even wrapped them in tissue paper with hockey stick stickers. Im not a monster. 

He stepped out, hair still wet from the shower, jersey slung over one shoulder. His eyes met mine briefly, and I forced the kindest, brightest, most Emery Collins smile I could manage. 

“Hey,” I said cheerfully, stepping forward. “That was insane, you rushed it. I baked these. For you.” 

He looked at the box. 

Then at me.

“Did I do something to you?” I asked louder. Now people were turning to look like I was crazy but at this point I couldn’t care less. 

He stared at me, calm and unreadable. “No.” 

“Then why do you act like I’m this massive pain in your ass? I’ve cracked jokes, offered you my pen, saved you a seat in homeroom. I even helped you find your locker when you got lost that day, and you didn’t even say thank you. I’ve tried, Atlas. I’ve really tried to be your friend.” 

His jaw ticked. His voice was low, cold. “I never asked you to be my friend.” 

I blinked. “Excuse me?” 

He folded his arms, tone sharp but even. “Look, I don’t want to be part of your little Miss Princess Act.” 

I stepped back like I’d been slapped. “Miss Princess, what?” 

“You don’t have to make everyone like you. You don’t have to pretend to be kind just to feel good about yourself.” 

My throat tightened, heart slamming against my ribs, my hand sill holding the damn cookie box like a trophy of humiliation. 

People were watching. Whispering. 

And he just turned and walked away. 

No. 

No freaking way he was going to walk away after embarrassing me like that. 

“Atlas!” I yelled. 

He stopped mid-step. 

I stormed up to him and shoved the box into his chest, hard enough that he had to grab it. 

“Fine,” I snapped. “You don’t want to be friends? Great. Amazing. But mark my words, I’m going to crush you. On the track, 

in the classroom, wherever I see you…I’m coming for the crown And you can thrash the cookies if you want to.” 

Then I turned on my heel and walked off like a girl on fire. 

I didn’t look back. 

But I really hoped he choked on the smell of chocolate chip cookies. 

And that, right there, that embarrassing cookie moment in the hallway was the very beginning of my downfall. 

Because, as much as I wanted to write Atlas Lawson off as a one-me nuisance, the universe had other plans. Evil, well- packaged, six-foot-two plans with annoyingly good cheekbones and an even more annoyingly high IQ.

Turns out, Atlas stupid, annoying jerk-face Lawson wasn’t just a ockey prodigy with lips wornen would write songs about. 

Nope. 

He was smart. 

So smart, in fact, that he managed to do the unthinkable, push e to second place in our final GPA rankings. 

SECOND place! 

Me. 

That had never happened. Not in Preschool, not in Elementary school, not in middle school, and certainly not in my entire four years of high-functioning, overachieving, anxiety-powered high school life. 

And now, on graduation day, I sat there in my cap and gown, clapping like a good little graduate while the Dean called out 

his name. 

“And now, it’s my honor to recognize the student who has achieved the highest academic distinction in the graduating class of 2024. This year’s Valedictorian, with the highest cumulative GPA, is Atlas Lawson!” 

Cue the thunderous applause. 

I rolled my eyes so hard I swear I saw the inside of my

skull. 

Walking across the stage like he owned the damn planet. The crowd loved it. Even the parents behind me murmured, “he’s so handsome” and “what a bright young man.” 

Barf. 

Gag me with a diploma. 

But no. I wasn’t going to let him ruin this moment. This was my graduation too. And I had other things to be happy about… real things. 

Like my amazing friends. 

My loyal boyfriend Kevin. 

My bright, glittering future. 

And most importantly… 

“There’s my little golden locks!” 

I turned just in time to be swept into a bear hug. 

“Dad,” I laughed as he spun me gently and then set me back on the ground. 

“I’m so proud of you, baby,” he said, his voice thick. “And I know your mom would be too.” 

My chest squeezed, and I smiled through it, gripping his arms thtly. “Thanks, Dad.” 

We pulled apart, and he wiped his eyes like he wasn’t totally getting emotional, which meant I was definitely getting emotional. But before I could say anything else, his face lit up, ad he turned. 

“Oh! There he is, the man of the hour.”

As a result I’ve ended up with a lot of bags of coffee beans - too many to go through right now before they go stale.

I’ve been looking at freezing them and can see the general consensus is to portion it out into smaller batches. I haven’t got enough ziplock bags to do this currently, I was wondering if freezing a 250g sealed bag of coffee would be ok, and then take it out when I’m ready to use it all in one go.

“Mr. Sinclair, I’ll marry you,” Sophia Fraley slurred. She’d just killed half a bottle of vodka, and her tongue felt three sizes too big. 

A long silence answered her. Then a deep, sleepy voice came through, irritation clear beneath the gravel. “You even know what time it is?” 

She squinted at her phone and finally saw two in the morning. “Sorry. I’ll call tomorrow.” 

“Okay,” Henry Sinclair muttered. 

She blinked. “Wait, what?” 

“I’ll leave on a business trip in the morning. Back in four weeks. We’ll sign the papers then,” he said. 

“Oh… okay.” 

The line clicked off. Sophia stared at the screen, her head spinning. 

Two weeks earlier, her aunt Amanda, who lived in a distant small town, had called. 

She said, “Belinda, the old lady next door, she’s got this perfect grandson, Henry. Honors student, decent college, city job, dental plan, and even Christmas bonuses. I think maybe I can see you guys up.” 

Sophia agreed to shut her up, planning to ghost. 

That same night, however, Henry phoned. “No time for blind dates or small talk,” he’d said. “If you’re up for it, let’s skip straight to the courthouse.” 

‘Is this guy nuts?’ she wondered, blindsided. 

He didn’t wait for an answer. “Sleep on it,” he said, and the line went dead. 

She hadn’t thought about it once, until tonight, drunk and lonely she dialed. 

Sophia flicked through her phone, and the internet was still losing it. The NO.1 on the feed: Charlotte Wynn, A-list queen. knocked up. And the guy everyone swore was the father was Richard Lane, the married leading man. 

The “home-wrecker” hashtags were flying when Andrew Carter, he Carter Group’s spare heir, suddenly jumped in. 

He posted: \[She’s my girl, the baby’s mine, and we’re walking down the aisle. Chill.\] 

Skeptics kept clapping back, so Andrew dropped a clip from Charlotte’s last birthday: him on one knee, ring box open, and her squealing yes. 

Overnight, the comment section flipped to heart-emojis and champagne gifs. 

Now the top tag was simply: \[Charlotte’s marrying Andrew Cartel 

Sophia stared at the screen, half-laughing, half-sick. T’m his girlfriend, and he’s out there proposing to someone else? Eight years, and I don’t even get a goodbye text. Fine. Time to bail before the joke’s on me 

And Henry had said it so casually on the phone: “I just want the gular deal. Have each other’s backs, stay cool, and grow gray together. That single sentence sold her.

Boring, maybe, but it sounded like heaven. Andrew had never even once offered her a boring promise. 

She took a breath and then yanked her suitcase from the closet. The villa was in Andrew’s name, she was only a visitor who’d overstayed. Time to ghost before the happy couple came home. 

Sophia had an early shift, so she’d only grabbed a couple of hours of sleep before dragging herself downstairs. 

Andrew was spread across the couch, hair wrecked, brows pinched like the liquor still had a grip. 

She side-stepped the mess and started making breakfast. 

While the coffee brewed, Andrew shuffled into the kitchen, breath still boozy, and draped himself over her shoulders. 

He muttered. “Babe, my head’s splitting. Make me that hangover drink, yeah?” 

Sophia frowned, “Go sit on the couch. I’ll be there in two minutes.” 

“But I wanna stay with you,” he mumbled, his eyes still closed. 

“You smell awful,” she said, wrinkling her nose. 

“Really?” He sniffed his shirt and grimaced. “Okay, shower first.” 

She filled the blender with ice, a fistful of fresh mint, orange juice, a big squeeze of honey, and a pinch of salt. It was the homemade reset button she kept ready for his late-night client dinners. 

The machine buzzed. The sound dragged her straight back to every other morning-after. ‘Eight years of curing his hangover; zero years of curing his wandering eye, she laughed under her breath. ‘Fine. Last batch. Period at the end of the relationship.’ 

By the time he padded downstairs, the glass was sweating on the counter. He pressed the cold rim to his temple, took a slow sip of the minty honey slush, and didn’t offer a word about last night. 

“Congrats,” she said. 

“For what?” He looked up, blank. 

“After so many years of birthday proposals, Charlotte finally took the bait,” she said calmly. 

She had always known about Charlotte. The crush had lasted fifteen years, ever since junior high. On every single birthday, Andrew dropped to one knee and proposed. He never missed one, not even during the eight years he spent with Sophia. 

‘Of course I care. The thought tasted bitter, but she had loved him enough to play the fool. 

Andrew frowned. “You saw the feed?” 

Sophia just looked at him, saying nothing. 

It’s PR,’ he said, like he was reading the weather. “Once the noise dies down, we file for divorce. Chill.” 

She scoffed, “PR So you’re actually getting a marriage license and throwing a real wedding?” 

“Of course, he replied. “Otherwise, my family would never buy 

“Then how is that just PR? You’re getting married,” she shot back 

“It’s fake, alright? Quit digging,” he muttered, downing the last of the smoothie and heading upstairs.

“I don’t want to referee whatever circus you and Charlotte haveing.” Sophia said, “but you and I still need to close our books.” 

Andrew turned and stared at her. “Close what books?” 

She drew a slow breath. “We’re done. I’m out.” 

“Are you even listening?” he barked. “The wedding is staged. We untie it the second the cameras leave. Why the drama? This doesn’t touch you. Just play dumb and wait it out. You need the attention that bad?” 

Have you ever paid any attention to me at all?’ The thought stung. “Real or staged, I’m out,” she said, voice level. “We’re over, Andrew.” 

“Sophia,” he barked. 

Tm exhausted.” She shut her eyes. “Eight years of loving you has emptied the tank. That’s enough. I’m out.” 

“Fine, walk! Just don’t come crawling back.” He snatched his coat and slammed the door. 

Silence. For the first time, Sophia felt the weight slide off her shoulders and stay gone. 

Sophia was an OB-GYN at Carter Hospital. She got to her office early and juggled patients while Maggie, the nurse, rattled off the latest gossip. 

Maggie sighed, “So whose baby is Charlotte really carrying? First it was Richard, and now it’s Andrew. If it were me, I’d pick Andrew. He’s loaded and crazy-hot. 

“Plus, he’s been hung up on her for fifteen straight years. That’s. Ike, lifetime-movie devotion.” 

Sophia couldn’t take any more. She told Maggie to take one of the moms-to-be upstairs for her exam. 

She’d barely sat down when Andrew called. He demanded, “Clear your schedule. Charlotte’s coming in for her prenatal 

tomorrow.”

***Operative Note: Today’s Coffee Diary Revealed More Heart Than Caffeine***

*“In a world of fading pulses, she walks in like a living defibrillator — restoring life where routine had gone flatline.”*

In the hush of evening’s quiet arithmetic,  
I opened the *Coffee Diaries*,  
and there she walked in—  
*the girl in* ***denim dreams and a rose-red top*** *(Of course my way of greeting)*,  
a colour so alive it seemed to hum its own heartbeat.  
That rose-red wasn’t just a shade—  
it was *declaration*,  
it was *arrival*,  
it was the soft rebellion of someone  
who refuses to dim for any universe.

Her skin—  
white as milk?  
No.  
Whiter.  
Whiter than ***first snow on untouched Himalayan ridges***,  
whiter than ***moonlight peeled from the lunar crown***,  
whiter than the ***breath of dawn before the sun remembers to rise***.  
Purity had a shape that day,  
and it walked in denim and red.

But her eyes—  
ah, her eyes…  
***they carried a twin-flame dialect:***  
***half passion, half logic,***  
a preacher of fire,  
a scholar of reason.  
And somewhere curled inside that gaze  
was that subtle, amused  
*“men-are-trouble”* philosophy  
that made her even more irresistibly real.

Her nature?  
**Sherni.**  
Unapologetically fierce,  
unyielding as summer heat on Rajasthani stones.  
She moved like the **Jhansi ki Rani**,  
breathing sovereignty,  
wearing independence the way some wear perfume—  
naturally, inevitably, undeniably.

And in her presence  
***there was a rhythm—***  
***a heartbeat of purpose so steady***  
***it could recalibrate the pulse***  
***of anyone near her.***

Yet beneath that armour  
lived compassion so luminous  
it could warm even winter silence.  
The world may see her as  
**Dr. …... ....... Brigadier**,  
a prefix polished by relentless nights,  
a suffix carved by battles the world never witnessed  
Sure to be true as the pulse beneath a calm wrist.

But I—  
I saw the person between the letters.  
The softness unadvertised.  
The care unspoken.  
The girl whose dreams were  
as *innocent as monsoon raindrops*,  
innocent in intention,  
yet mighty in devotion to her family.

The world examined her from a distance,  
but ***only a rare eye could diagnose***  
***the tenderness beneath the fierce exterior—***  
***a quiet compassion hiding***  
***like an unheard murmur.***

And then came her words—  
measured, refined, deliberate.  
***Every sentence felt like a surgeon’s incision—***  
***precise, clean, intentional,***  
***cutting through confusion***  
***and suturing meaning back into the moment.***

The world never glimpsed  
the sacred sanctum she carries inside—  
a spirituality unadvertised,  
***soft, secret, silent.***  
But I saw it.  
In every word she breathed,  
in every letter she crafted,  
in every syllable that drifted  
like petals from an unseen rose.

And oh, each moment—  
each *planck-second*,  
each *zeptosecond*,  
each infinitesimal flicker  
of time’s smallest architecture—  
was precious.  
Two hours became  
a galaxy folded into conversation,  
an entire cosmos balanced  
on the rim of a coffee cup.

So yes—  
**“*****Kab likh raha main had my attention absence*****”**—  
noted.  
But here I am.  
***Abhi likh raha hoon.***  
Because some evenings carve themselves  
into memory with too sharp a clarity to ignore.  
And some ***girl in rose-red top***

I didn’t realize I was burning holes into the side of his head until he looked up. 

Our eyes met. 

His lips twitched.

A small, smug, soul-crushing smile. 

And then he turned to his friend and said something that made im laugh.

Laila, my best friend and long-time chaos anchor, leaned across the desk with her usual iced coffee and a raised brow “You’re legit about to shoot lasers at him.” 

“Oh, I wish I could do more.” I flung the paper onto my desk like it had personally betrayed me. 

Laila stifled a laugh. “It’s just one point, Em. You still got the second-highest score.” 

“That only makes it worse!” I hissed, glaring at the red ink like it mocked me. “If it were anyone else, fine. I’d shrug it off. But it’s him.” 

“Atlas Lawson,” Laila said dreamily, her eyes glued to him like he was the sun incarnate. Sadly, my beautiful friend had also fallen blindly into the trap of his looks, which, by the way, I still thought was nothing far from average (okay, maybe I lied). 

I rolled my eyes. “The bane of my high school existence.” 

She sipped her iced coffee and didn’t even try to hide her grin. “He doesn’t even talk to anyone, Em. Maybe he’s not evil. Just… socially constipated.” 

“He smiled, Laila.” 

“Oh, the audacity.” 

I dropped my forehead to the desk and groaned. “Why couldn’t he be dumb? Or ugly? Or… I don’t know, allergic to pencils?” 

Laila chuckled, reaching over to pat my back. “You’re spiraling again.” 

I didn’t reply. I just let my cheek press against the cold desk, eyes peeking over the edge at him. 

Atlas was now stretching, arms over his head, muscles flexing under his stupid black hoodie like he was in some sportswear ad. 

God. 

I hate him. 

I hate him so freaking bad. 

And the worst part? 

This was only Monday.

I don’t usually hate people. 

In fact, I love everyone. 

I’m that girl. The one who volunteers on weekends, bottle-feeds ick puppies, bakes cookies for bake sales, and organizes food drives like it’s a competitive sport. I’m the “teacher’s favorite,” the “golden girl,” the one with the heart of gold, as Mrs. Benson once said while dabbing tears from her eyes at the spring award ceremony.

He walked into school wearing that hoodie pulled up, hair slightly damp, bag slung over one shoulder like he couldn’t care less. Every girl in a 30-foot radius physically stopped breathing. But not me. No, I was on a mission to be kind. 

I approached him at the vending machines. 

“Word of advice,” I’d said with a sunny grin, tilting my head toward the machine, “unless you’re into stomach cramps, avoid the tuna sandwich.” 

He blinked at me. 

Didn’t laugh. 

Didn’t smile. 

Didn’t even nod. 

Just walked right past me. 

At first, I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he didn’t hear me? Maybe he was having a rough day? But every time after that, every joke, every smile, every attempt to be even slightly human to him, he ignored me. 

But here’s the thing about me: I don’t give up. 

The more he pushed me away, the more I was determined to break through that arctic wall of broody silence. 

So, after one of his hockey games where he’d scored the winning goal and the crowd was practically chanting his name, I decided to be the bigger person. I waited by the locker exit, holding a small white box tied with a blue ribbon. 

Homemade chocolate chip cookies. Still warm. 

I even wrapped them in tissue paper with hockey stick stickers. Im not a monster. 

He stepped out, hair still wet from the shower, jersey slung over one shoulder. His eyes met mine briefly, and I forced the kindest, brightest, most Emery Collins smile I could manage. 

“Hey,” I said cheerfully, stepping forward. “That was insane, you rushed it. I baked these. For you.” 

He looked at the box. 

Then at me. 

Then said, “No, thank you.” 

And walked away.

“Did I do something to you?” I asked louder. Now people were turning to look like I was crazy but at this point I couldn’t care less.

“Then why do you act like I’m this massive pain in your ass? I’ve cracked jokes, offered you my pen, saved you a seat in homeroom. I even helped you find your locker when you got lost that day, and you didn’t even say thank you. I’ve tried, Atlas. I’ve really tried to be your friend.” 

His jaw ticked. His voice was low, cold. “I never asked you to be my friend.” 

I blinked. “Excuse me?” 

He folded his arms, tone sharp but even. “Look, I don’t want to be part of your little Miss Princess Act.” 

I stepped back like I’d been slapped. “Miss Princess, what?” 

“You don’t have to make everyone like you. You don’t have to pretend to be kind just to feel good about yourself.” 

My throat tightened, heart slamming against my ribs, my hand sill holding the damn cookie box like a trophy of humiliation. 

People were watching. Whispering. 

And he just turned and walked away. 

No. 

No freaking way he was going to walk away after embarrassing me like that. 

“Atlas!” I yelled. 

He stopped mid-step. 

I stormed up to him and shoved the box into his chest, hard enough that he had to grab it. 

“Fine,” I snapped. “You don’t want to be friends? Great. Amazing. But mark my words, I’m going to crush you. On the track, 

in the classroom, wherever I see you…I’m coming for the crown And you can thrash the cookies if you want to.” 

Then I turned on my heel and walked off like a girl on fire. 

I didn’t look back. 

But I really hoped he choked on the smell of chocolate chip cookies. 

And that, right there, that embarrassing cookie moment in the hallway was the very beginning of my downfall. 

Because, as much as I wanted to write Atlas Lawson off as a one-me nuisance, the universe had other plans. Evil, well- packaged, six-foot-two plans with annoyingly good cheekbones and an even more annoyingly high IQ.

Turns out, Atlas stupid, annoying jerk-face Lawson wasn’t just a ockey prodigy with lips wornen would write songs about. 

Nope. 

He was smart. 

So smart, in fact, that he managed to do the unthinkable, push e to second place in our final GPA rankings. 

SECOND place! 

Me. 

That had never happened. Not in Preschool, not in Elementary school, not in middle school, and certainly not in my entire four years of high-functioning, overachieving, anxiety-powered high school life. 

And now, on graduation day, I sat there in my cap and gown, clapping like a good little graduate while the Dean called out 

his name. 

“And now, it’s my honor to recognize the student who has achieved the highest academic distinction in the graduating class of 2024. This year’s Valedictorian, with the highest cumulative GPA, is Atlas Lawson!” 

Cue the thunderous applause. 

I rolled my eyes so hard I swear I saw the inside of my

Walking across the stage like he owned the damn planet. The crowd loved it. Even the parents behind me murmured, “he’s so handsome” and “what a bright young man.” 

Barf. 

Gag me with a diploma. 

But no. I wasn’t going to let him ruin this moment. This was my graduation too. And I had other things to be happy about… real things. 

Like my amazing friends. 

My loyal boyfriend Kevin. 

My bright, glittering future. 

And most importantly… 

“There’s my little golden locks!” 

I turned just in time to be swept into a bear hug. 

“Dad,” I laughed as he spun me gently and then set me back on the ground. 

“I’m so proud of you, baby,” he said, his voice thick. “And I know your mom would be too.” 

My chest squeezed, and I smiled through it, gripping his arms thtly. “Thanks, Dad.” 

We pulled apart, and he wiped his eyes like he wasn’t totally getting emotional, which meant I was definitely getting emotional. But before I could say anything else, his face lit up, ad he turned. 

“Oh! There he is, the man of the hour.”

No. No no no no no. 

And then I remembered. 

Oh yeah.

My dad is dating Atlas Lawson’s mom. 

Yup.

My actual father. 

Dating the mother of my academic nemesis. 

The human migraine that has haunted my educational career. 

The universe really does hate me.

I (39 F) grew up drinking milk and eating dairy products--cheese, yogurt, ice cream--but I noticed as I got into maybe my late teens I begin to have trouble. One day I got a large shake from Checkers/Rallys and was fine enjoyed but that night had the worst gas of my life. 

It started with just the shakes so I quit drinking them. Then I noticed the same problem with ice cream. I used to could demolish a pint with no ill effects. Now I'm blown up like a Macy's' parade balloon. 

The worst though is I found out I CANNOT have hot coffee with cow's milk. I ordered a hot coffee from McDonald's dashed in creamer, threw up I figured it was a McDonald's thing, no same happened with Dunkin and Starbucks hot coffees. I can only have hot coffee with nut or oat milk now. 

The weird thing is I can still eat other dairy products. Cheese, yogurt doesn't bother me. I eat pizza, cheeseburgers, hell even slices of cheese with no ill effects.

When I bought my **Nespresso Vertuo Pop**, the sales staff told me that *cleaning* should be done **every end of the day or before using it the next day**.

To clarify, she meant **daily cleaning**, not **descaling**. According to her, descaling is only needed **once a year**.

Based on [YouTube instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oJq8CVoHBw&t=81s), the **cleaning cycle takes around 7 minutes**, where the machine runs water through the system to flush out leftover coffee. She also mentioned that **even if the machine wasn’t used**, cleaning should still be done daily to help prevent **air lock issues** when it sits unused.

Honestly, the cleaning process sometimes takes longer than actually brewing coffee. If done daily, it also feels like it consumes more electricity than making a cup itself.

So I’m curious—**do you really clean your Vertuo Pop every day?**  
If not, what’s your routine that’s worked well for you so far without issues?

* Every other day?
* Twice a week?
* Once a week?
* Something else?

Everyone has their own reasons for quitting coffee, and reactions vary wildly. But recently, on a hunch, I started drinking a lot more water every day. No science experiment, no complex plan. Just consistent rehydration. And the result? I feel significantly better.

I’ve had a couple cups of decaf, but I’m done with caffeinated coffee for good. Looking back, I now see coffee may have dehydrated me to such an extent that it triggered a cascade of other issues. Once I focused on proper hydration, everything shifted. My energy improved, my body feels calmer, and even the worst of my coffee-withdrawal symptoms eased up enough to make quitting feel much more manageable.

There’s a common belief that coffee is as strong a diuretic as alcohol. I once read a comparison along those lines, and while it may not be exact, the pattern holds: hydration recommendations only work if we actually follow them. Many of us don’t. If the informal rule for alcohol is one glass of water per drink, I suspect coffee deserves a similar level of respect but hardly anyone treats it that way.

No preaching, just observation. If this thought helps even one person rethink their water intake while cutting coffee, it’s worth sharing.",8,1767025791.0,decaf,4,0.83,False

“All right, that’s all the time we have for this episode. Next time, we’ll dig even deeper and examine how the notorious thief Wang Xiaoming exploited legal loopholes to secure an acquittal in court. Thank you for tuning in—see you next time!”

Inside the radio studio, a well-dressed woman’s gentle yet steady voice radiated composure and confidence, making her words especially persuasive. As she spoke, she glanced through the glass at the show’s producer, and only after his signal did she remove her headphones.

She stood up, her slim figure accentuated by a perfectly tailored, expensive suit. With graceful movements, she tidied her long, black hair, slightly tousled from the headphones.

Exiting the studio, she was met with a warm smile from the producer, who gave her a thumbs-up and handed her a cup of hot coffee.

“Good show! Lawyer Wang!”

“Producer Ma, don’t say that—this was a team effort!” Wang Rong replied with a smile.

“Oh, don’t be so modest. Since your ‘Deadly Sinner’ show debuted late last year, ratings have climbed steadily. It’s now our station’s flagship evening program! You always pick those explosive cases that grab the public’s attention—your media instincts are unparalleled!”

Producer Ma kept laying on the flattery. The huge popularity of “Deadly Sinner” had attracted advertisers willing to pay premium rates during her segment, so of course he wanted to keep this money magnet happy.

After thanking her colleagues for their hard work, Wang Rong hurried off, with Ma Wen escorting her to the lobby.

Finding themselves alone, Wang Rong dropped her lighthearted manner and spoke earnestly: “Ma Wen, don’t be so formal. If you hadn’t stood up for me back then and given me a chance to host this legal show, I might never have made a comeback!”

“You know what my situation was like. You still dared to give me this opportunity, and I’ve always been grateful.” Wang Rong spoke from the heart; she truly appreciated Ma Wen’s support.

The day after Xing Jun’s fall, the city was in an uproar. Media reports were everywhere, turning Wang Rong’s family upside down. Tabloids ran headlines like “Washed-up Actress Wang Rong Dumps Old, Poor Husband for Married Financial Star” and “Husband Catches Wife Cheating, Lover Falls in Bizarre Accident,” detailing every aspect in full-page spreads.

Though the coroner ruled Xing Jun’s death accidental and held no one responsible, damaging rumors about Wang Rong still spread like wildfire. She was labeled a “husband-killing homewrecker,” and even old gossip—like her rumored unwed pregnancy and allegedly driving away Fang Ming’s previous girlfriend—was dredged up and sensationalized.

During that period, reporters constantly gathered outside Wang Rong’s building and her son’s school. Fang Ming, harassed by paparazzi, got into a physical altercation, which itself became gossip fodder.

It seemed society wanted to destroy Wang Rong. But everyone underestimated her. She was a woman who became stronger with every blow, who never admitted defeat. Numbed to emotion—no shame, no humiliation, not even anger—she was left with nothing but the urge to fight back from rock bottom.

So she sought out Ma Wen, her classmate from primary and secondary school. He’d once confessed his feelings for her in junior high, and though she’d turned him down, they remained friends. She recommended herself to Ma Wen as a radio host for a legal program.

“A popular legal show, blending true crime and legal knowledge—this has never been done in the city’s broadcast history. It’s worth a try. But…” Ma Wen hesitated. “You’re just too controversial right now… Of course I want to help, but I’m not sure the higher-ups will approve.”

“You’re right, I am the city’s most controversial figure. That’s exactly why this is the perfect time! The public doesn’t want virtue—they want something that excites them. Right now, the level of talk about me is higher than at my peak—no, higher than all the top stars in the city combined! Imagine—wouldn’t people rush to hear what I have to say? Wouldn’t they tune in to a show hosted by someone like me?” Wang Rong’s beautiful eyes shone with determination. “Ma Wen, just give me a chance, and I’ll prove myself!”

Moved by her resolve, Ma Wen agreed. “All right, I’ll do my best to persuade the bosses, but I can’t promise…”

“Thank you! As long as you’re willing to try, that’s enough. And I’m sure they’ll agree!” Wang Rong said confidently. “I’ve already thought of a name for the show. Some magazines have called me a ‘deadly sinner’—let’s use that! A ‘sinner’ talking about crime and the law—how explosive is that?”

As it turned out, Wang Rong had made the right bet.

Her show, “Deadly Sinner,” was an unprecedented hit from its very first episode. Public discussion shifted from her affair with Xing Jun and the circumstances of his fall to amazement at her courage and resilience.

The cases she covered were all major, sensational ones. She unraveled their twists and turns, demystified complex legal principles, and the public was forced to see her in a new light: quick-witted, clear-thinking, and eloquent.

The media stopped calling her a “homewrecker” and began describing her as a “remarkable woman.”

Ma Wen watched Wang Rong transform from a pariah to a legal world celebrity and star host, and could only admire her.

“We’ve been friends for years. You’re the smartest and bravest person I know. I just did my part, but turning things around like this—that was all you,” Ma Wen said with feeling.

“…It’s not magic, it’s a miracle,” Wang Rong replied. Since marrying Fang Ming, she’d attributed every bit of good fortune to the Virgin Mary’s blessing.

When she left the station, her young assistant Judy was already waiting with the car. Wang Rong enjoyed the dinner and late-night snack Judy had bought while listening to her report and the schedule ahead.

“Sis Rong, tomorrow afternoon I’ll drive you to the prison to visit Wang Xiaoming and dig up more details. Next Monday morning, we have a meeting with Chaoyang Publishing to discuss the second book’s release and publicity.” Judy reported efficiently as she drove.

Wang Rong ate and replied, then suddenly said, “No, reschedule Monday. I’ve arranged to meet Xiao Zhang at the Legal Center to discuss his case and prepare for court.”

Judy frowned slightly. “Sis Rong, let Xiao Zhang reschedule—the book deal is more important. You’re already representing him for free; he should accommodate you.”

“No, Xiao Zhang has been unemployed for so long because of this case! He finally found a job and got his boss’s approval to take that day off. How can I ask him to change it?” Wang Rong protested.

“We can reschedule with Chaoyang. They can wait—several publishers have approached me recently about collaborating, and Chaoyang knows my book makes them money.” Wang Rong said confidently.

Since “Deadly Sinner” became a hit, Chaoyang Publishing contacted Wang Rong to turn her radio cases into a book. The first volume became an instant bestseller and won the award for “Most Popular Youth Book.”

At the height of her media success, Wang Rong also gave back by establishing a legal service center in a poor neighborhood, offering affordable or even free legal help to grassroots citizens.

She was often interviewed in her legal center, saying, “The law should be just, not tilted by poverty. Equality before the law is not just a slogan, but my action and promise.” To the public, Wang Rong was now a living Bodhisattva, and the media dubbed her a “fresh spring of the judiciary,” a “living goddess of law.”

“Fine, I’ll reschedule with Chaoyang in the morning,” Judy replied with a wry smile. She knew that when Wang Rong helped someone, she did so without reservation.

Back home, her husband Fang Ming and son Fang Zheng were already asleep. She didn’t even peek in on Fang Zheng, but quickly showered and went to bed. Since moving into media, Wang Rong was busier than ever. Even though she returned home every night, she and Fang Ming might not see or speak to each other more than once or twice a week. She had grown used to this arrangement.

In bed, Fang Ming felt his wife lie down beside him and opened his eyes—he hadn’t been sleeping.

When he heard her steady breathing and was sure she was asleep, he quietly got up, took two beers from the kitchen, and sat on the sofa, drinking and staring blankly.

Earlier that day, Fang Ming had been summoned to school because Fang Zheng had gotten into a fight. Fang Zheng was twelve; kids today mature quickly, and he could understand the gossip about his mother. It pained Fang Ming, but it was even harder for his son.

That day, some troublemakers in class made jokes about Wang Rong’s scandal. Fang Zheng couldn’t take it and lashed out, getting into a brawl.

Fang Ming had no intention of telling Wang Rong. She was too busy with her career to care about their son’s discipline or studies.

But he decided to suggest soon that they send Fang Zheng abroad for school. Only then could the boy escape public scrutiny and grow up in a healthier environment.

He knew Wang Rong would agree—she’d realize it was the best arrangement if she only thought about it. These days, her only bond with their son seemed to be financial.

The idea that his son had to leave them to grow up healthy struck Fang Ming as both cruel and laughable. He felt he had failed Fang Zheng.

But there was another person he had failed even more: his ex-girlfriend, Xia Yu.

Xia Yu had been with him since his youth, from his days as a penniless delinquent to his rise as a feared gangster, and then as a successful businessman. She was always by his side.

Xia Yu was delicate and classically beautiful, with a unique grace that belied her humble background. But what Fang Ming loved most was her gentle nature.

She was always tender, never lost her temper, was utterly devoted to him, and cared for him meticulously—a great comfort to Fang Ming, who had lost his mother early.

She gave him complete freedom, never interfered or pressured him to marry. As a young man with nothing, Fang Ming couldn’t provide for a family, and even after making it in the underworld, his life was dangerous. He never intended to settle down.

It wasn’t until he found legitimate success that he and Xia Yu agreed: if she ever became pregnant, they would marry.

But Xia Yu never conceived. Doctors said she had difficulty getting pregnant—something that weighed on Fang Ming, who longed for a child.

Lost in memory, Fang Ming took a big gulp of beer and admitted to himself: If he was to marry, he wanted a wife who could give him children, and Xia Yu couldn’t. That was the real reason he never married her.

“Yu… I’m sorry… I can’t be with you anymore.” In a seafront mansion in the suburbs, Fang Ming broke the news to Xia Yu.

“…Is it because of her? Wang Rong?” Xia Yu looked heartbroken but spoke calmly.

“I have no choice… She’s pregnant with my child! I can’t just walk away!” Fang Ming was agitated, but his guilt was obvious to Xia Yu.

Fang Ming was not usually weak-willed, but Wang Rong broke his defenses. Perhaps it wasn’t just her beauty, but her completely different personality—Xia Yu was like fragrant jasmine tea, while Wang Rong was strong liquor, bringing excitement to Fang Ming’s middle age.

“I see. So that’s how it is,” Xia Yu said. Fang Ming looked up to see a flash of realization on her face—a look he never understood at the time.

Xia Yu quickly turned away, her tone even gentler. “Yes, you should take responsibility. I’ll leave. Don’t worry, I’ll never bother you again.”

Over a decade of love ended just like that. Fang Ming gave Xia Yu a large sum as compensation. She sold off the properties he’d given her and emigrated to the United States. That was the last he ever heard from her.

He had hesitated to marry her because she couldn’t have children. He knew Xia Yu realized this and must have been deeply hurt, yet she never uttered a word of complaint and always loved him with all her heart.

Fang Ming could not hold back his tears, covering his face in grief.

I… am truly a selfish, contemptible man!!!

Fang Ming cried out in his heart.

But Yu, you must know, my retribution has come—my career is gone, my wife has cheated. I am a joke to everyone! To her, I’m just a pitiful, despised old man!

I can’t even remember… how long it’s been since she last spoke to me…

He thought, if his own suffering could bring Xia Yu any comfort now, then at least it had some value.

That night, he wept quietly, not knowing if it was for Xia Yu, for Wang Rong, or for himself.

Laila, my best friend and long-time chaos anchor, leaned across the desk with her usual iced coffee and a raised brow “You’re legit about to shoot lasers at him.” 

“Oh, I wish I could do more.” I flung the paper onto my desk like it had personally betrayed me. 

Laila stifled a laugh. “It’s just one point, Em. You still got the second-highest score.” 

“That only makes it worse!” I hissed, glaring at the red ink like it mocked me. “If it were anyone else, fine. I’d shrug it off. But it’s him.” 

“Atlas Lawson,” Laila said dreamily, her eyes glued to him like he was the sun incarnate. Sadly, my beautiful friend had also fallen blindly into the trap of his looks, which, by the way, I still thought was nothing far from average (okay, maybe I lied). 

I rolled my eyes. “The bane of my high school existence.” 

She sipped her iced coffee and didn’t even try to hide her grin. “He doesn’t even talk to anyone, Em. Maybe he’s not evil. Just… socially constipated.” 

“He smiled, Laila.” 

“Oh, the audacity.” 

I dropped my forehead to the desk and groaned. “Why couldn’t he be dumb? Or ugly? Or… I don’t know, allergic to pencils?” 

Laila chuckled, reaching over to pat my back. “You’re spiraling again.” 

I didn’t reply. I just let my cheek press against the cold desk, eyes peeking over the edge at him. 

Atlas was now stretching, arms over his head, muscles flexing under his stupid black hoodie like he was in some sportswear ad. 

God. 

I hate him. 

I hate him so freaking bad. 

And the worst part? 

This was only Monday.

I’m that girl. The one who volunteers on weekends, bottle-feeds ick puppies, bakes cookies for bake sales, and organizes food drives like it’s a competitive sport.

He walked into school wearing that hoodie pulled up, hair slightly damp, bag slung over one shoulder like he couldn’t care less. Every girl in a 30-foot radius physically stopped breathing. But not me. No, I was on a mission to be kind. 

I approached him at the vending machines. 

“Word of advice,” I’d said with a sunny grin, tilting my head toward the machine, “unless you’re into stomach cramps, avoid the tuna sandwich.” 

He blinked at me. 

Didn’t laugh. 

Didn’t smile. 

Didn’t even nod. 

Just walked right past me. 

At first, I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he didn’t hear me? Maybe he was having a rough day? But every time after that, every joke, every smile, every attempt to be even slightly human to him, he ignored me. 

But here’s the thing about me: I don’t give up. 

The more he pushed me away, the more I was determined to break through that arctic wall of broody silence. 

So, after one of his hockey games where he’d scored the winning goal and the crowd was practically chanting his name, I decided to be the bigger person. I waited by the locker exit, holding a small white box tied with a blue ribbon. 

Homemade chocolate chip cookies. Still warm. 

I even wrapped them in tissue paper with hockey stick stickers. Im not a monster. 

He stepped out, hair still wet from the shower, jersey slung over one shoulder. His eyes met mine briefly, and I forced the kindest, brightest, most Emery Collins smile I could manage. 

“Hey,” I said cheerfully, stepping forward. “That was insane, you rushed it. I baked these. For you.” 

He looked at the box. 

Then at me. 

Then said, “No, thank you.” 

And walked away.

“Did I do something to you?” I asked louder. Now people were turning to look like I was crazy but at this point I couldn’t care less. 

He stared at me, calm and unreadable. “No.” 

“Then why do you act like I’m this massive pain in your ass? I’ve cracked jokes, offered you my pen, saved you a seat in homeroom. I even helped you find your locker when you got lost that day, and you didn’t even say thank you. I’ve tried, Atlas. I’ve really tried to be your friend.” 

His jaw ticked. His voice was low, cold. “I never asked you to be my friend.” 

I blinked. “Excuse me?” 

He folded his arms, tone sharp but even. “Look, I don’t want to be part of your little Miss Princess Act.” 

I stepped back like I’d been slapped. “Miss Princess, what?” 

“You don’t have to make everyone like you. You don’t have to pretend to be kind just to feel good about yourself.” 

My throat tightened, heart slamming against my ribs, my hand sill holding the damn cookie box like a trophy of humiliation. 

People were watching. Whispering. 

And he just turned and walked away. 

No. 

No freaking way he was going to walk away after embarrassing me like that. 

“Atlas!” I yelled. 

He stopped mid-step. 

I stormed up to him and shoved the box into his chest, hard enough that he had to grab it. 

“Fine,” I snapped. “You don’t want to be friends? Great. Amazing. But mark my words, I’m going to crush you. On the track,

1pyqnti,https://i.redd.it/ax0a4kub66ag1.jpeg,How do I live at home during a kitchen remodel - temporary kitchen tips?,"If you’re living through a kitchen remodel, you’re about to find out how creative you can get without a stove or sink. It’s a test of patience, flexibility, and a little humor. The good news? With a few smart setups, you can stay comfortable and keep your sanity until your dream kitchen is finished.



# Start with a plan (before demo day)

The biggest mistake homeowners make is waiting until the remodel begins to figure out how they’ll cook, eat, and clean up. Before construction starts, talk with your remodel team about where you’ll have access to power and running water. Most Phoenix Home Remodeling clients set up a temporary kitchen in a nearby space like a dining room, garage, or covered patio.

Ask your remodeler to help move a refrigerator, plug in a microwave, and protect nearby floors from daily foot traffic. Having this conversation early helps you avoid the “what do we do now” panic that hits the first night without a kitchen sink.



# Choose your essentials

Think of your temporary kitchen like camping with better lighting. You only need the basics:

* Mini fridge or full-size fridge moved to another room
* Microwave and toaster oven
* Slow cooker, Instant Pot, or air fryer for simple meals
* Coffee maker or electric kettle
* A folding table or small surface for food prep

For dishes, keep one set per person. It’s much easier to wash three plates than thirty. Most homeowners also buy a small dish rack and a plastic bin for washing dishes in the bathroom or laundry sink.



# Create a cleaning station

The hardest part of living through a remodel isn’t cooking. It’s cleaning up. Identify the sink you’ll use for rinsing and washing. The laundry room often works best because it’s deeper and sturdier. If you use a bathroom sink, place a towel under your dish bin to catch splashes.

You can also stock up on compostable plates, cups, and utensils. It’s not forever, and it helps reduce clutter while your kitchen is under construction.



# Think ahead about food storage

When cabinets are gone, so is your pantry space. Use clear plastic bins to store dry goods, snacks, and small kitchen tools. Label everything so you can find what you need quickly. If your remodel is happening during summer, keep coolers on hand for backup refrigeration in case you need to unplug your main fridge temporarily.

And remember, construction dust gets everywhere. Store food in sealed containers or zip-top bags to keep it clean.



# Set realistic meal expectations

Now’s not the time to try new recipes. Stick to low-mess, one-appliance meals. Sandwiches, salads, and slow-cooker dinners will be your best friends. Many families also plan for more takeout or outdoor grilling during the remodel. It’s not a luxury. It’s survival.

A design-build remodel team will help you plan for this phase and give you a realistic timeline so you’re not living out of boxes for longer than necessary. When your contractor communicates clearly, you can plan meals, grocery runs, and your routine around key milestones like demo, flooring, or countertop installation.



# Protect your sanity

Remodeling can feel like your home is turned upside down, but it’s temporary. Try to keep one “construction-free zone” where you can relax and eat without looking at dust or tools. Keep a small basket of essentials nearby like paper towels, sanitizer, snacks, and a sense of humor.

If you have kids or pets, set up boundaries with baby gates or painter’s plastic to keep them away from the work area. It’s safer for everyone and makes cleanup easier.



# Remember why you’re doing it

When you’re washing dishes in the bathroom sink for the tenth night in a row, it helps to picture the finished space. Think about the cabinets you picked, the countertops you loved, and the layout that will finally make cooking fun again. Every inconvenience is one step closer to that reward.

Hate. 

The English dictionary defines it as “intense or passionate dislike” 

But if you ask me? 

Hate is the heat in my blood when I see his face. 

It’s the twitch in my eye when he walks past with that infuriating calm like the world bends for him. 

Hate is… Atlas freaking Lawson. 

I stared down at the paper in my hand.

Of course he got a perfect score. 

I didn’t realize I was burning holes into the side of his head until he looked up. 

Our eyes met. 

His lips twitched. 

A smile. 

A small, smug, soul-crushing smile. 

And then he turned to his friend and said something that made im laugh. 

Like I was invisible. Like he hadn’t just one-upped me for the eighth time this semester. 

That’s it. 

That’s it. 

I was about to lose my freaking mind.

Laila, my best friend and long-time chaos anchor, leaned across the desk with her usual iced coffee and a raised brow “You’re legit about to shoot lasers at him.” 

“Oh, I wish I could do more.” I flung the paper onto my desk like it had personally betrayed me. 

Laila stifled a laugh. “It’s just one point, Em. You still got the second-highest score.” 

“That only makes it worse!” I hissed, glaring at the red ink like it mocked me. “If it were anyone else, fine. I’d shrug it off. But it’s him.” 

“Atlas Lawson,” Laila said dreamily, her eyes glued to him like he was the sun incarnate. Sadly, my beautiful friend had also fallen blindly into the trap of his looks, which, by the way, I still thought was nothing far from average (okay, maybe I lied). 

I rolled my eyes. “The bane of my high school existence.” 

She sipped her iced coffee and didn’t even try to hide her grin. “He doesn’t even talk to anyone, Em. Maybe he’s not evil. Just… socially constipated.” 

“He smiled, Laila.” 

“Oh, the audacity.” 

I dropped my forehead to the desk and groaned. “Why couldn’t he be dumb? Or ugly? Or… I don’t know, allergic to pencils?” 

Laila chuckled, reaching over to pat my back. “You’re spiraling again.” 

I didn’t reply. I just let my cheek press against the cold desk, eyes peeking over the edge at him. 

Atlas was now stretching, arms over his head, muscles flexing under his stupid black hoodie like he was in some sportswear ad. 

God. 

I hate him. 

I hate him so freaking bad. 

And the worst part? 

This was only Monday. 

\*\*\* 

I don’t usually hate people. 

In fact, I love everyone. 

I’m that girl. The one who volunteers on weekends, bottle-feeds ick puppies, bakes cookies for bake sales, and organizes food drives like it’s a competitive sport. I’m the “teacher’s favorite,” the “golden girl,” the one with the heart of gold, as Mrs. Benson once said while dabbing tears from her eyes at the spring award ceremony.

He walked into school wearing that hoodie pulled up, hair slightly damp, bag slung over one shoulder like he couldn’t care less. Every girl in a 30-foot radius physically stopped breathing. But not me. No, I was on a mission to be kind. 

I approached him at the vending machines. 

“Word of advice,” I’d said with a sunny grin, tilting my head toward the machine, “unless you’re into stomach cramps, avoid the tuna sandwich.” 

He blinked at me. 

Didn’t laugh. 

Didn’t smile. 

Didn’t even nod. 

Just walked right past me. 

At first, I gave him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he didn’t hear me? Maybe he was having a rough day? But every time after that, every joke, every smile, every attempt to be even slightly human to him, he ignored me. 

But here’s the thing about me: I don’t give up. 

The more he pushed me away, the more I was determined to break through that arctic wall of broody silence. 

So, after one of his hockey games where he’d scored the winning goal and the crowd was practically chanting his name, I decided to be the bigger person. I waited by the locker exit, holding a small white box tied with a blue ribbon. 

Homemade chocolate chip cookies. Still warm. 

I even wrapped them in tissue paper with hockey stick stickers. Im not a monster. 

He stepped out, hair still wet from the shower, jersey slung over one shoulder. His eyes met mine briefly, and I forced the kindest, brightest, most Emery Collins smile I could manage. 

“Hey,” I said cheerfully, stepping forward. “That was insane, you rushed it. I baked these. For you.” 

He looked at the box. 

Then at me. 

Then said, “No, thank you.” 

And walked away. 

My smile faltered. My stomach twisted.

“Did I do something to you?” I asked louder. Now people were turning to look like I was crazy but at this point I couldn’t care less. 

He stared at me, calm and unreadable. “No.” 

“Then why do you act like I’m this massive pain in your ass? I’ve cracked jokes, offered you my pen, saved you a seat in homeroom. I even helped you find your locker when you got lost that day, and you didn’t even say thank you. I’ve tried, Atlas. I’ve really tried to be your friend.” 

His jaw ticked. His voice was low, cold. “I never asked you to be my friend.” 

I blinked. “Excuse me?” 

He folded his arms, tone sharp but even. “Look, I don’t want to be part of your little Miss Princess Act.” 

I stepped back like I’d been slapped. “Miss Princess, what?” 

“You don’t have to make everyone like you. You don’t have to pretend to be kind just to feel good about yourself.” 

My throat tightened, heart slamming against my ribs, my hand sill holding the damn cookie box like a trophy of humiliation. 

People were watching. Whispering. 

And he just turned and walked away. 

No. 

No freaking way he was going to walk away after embarrassing me like that. 

“Atlas!” I yelled. 

He stopped mid-step. 

I stormed up to him and shoved the box into his chest, hard enough that he had to grab it. 

“Fine,” I snapped. “You don’t want to be friends? Great. Amazing. But mark my words, I’m going to crush you. On the track, 

in the classroom, wherever I see you…I’m coming for the crown And you can thrash the cookies if you want to.” 

Then I turned on my heel and walked off like a girl on fire. 

I didn’t look back. 

But I really hoped he choked on the smell of chocolate chip cookies. 

And that, right there, that embarrassing cookie moment in the hallway was the very beginning of my downfall. 

Because, as much as I wanted to write Atlas Lawson off as a one-me nuisance, the universe had other plans. Evil, well- packaged, six-foot-two plans with annoyingly good cheekbones and an even more annoyingly high IQ.

There are also differences in terms of what upset of gut. I can't drink coffee at all but my brother can no problem. We both are particular in our diet but it's been difficult to figure out exact foods.

Let's be honest: pain medicine textbooks can feel like they were written by someone who really wanted you to suffer. So I asked NotebookLM to help me digest Peng's Ultrasound-Guided Pain Medicine book - and then I rewrote the summary the way my brain actually likes it: simple, visual, slightly sarcastic, and exam-friendly.

This is not a replacement for the book, not medical advice, and definitely not a flex - just a ""why didn't anyone explain it like this before?"" style overview of key concepts in USG-guided pain procedures.

Let's make pain medicine hurt a little less. 

The Elbow:

A Note Before We Begin

The elbow can feel like a ridiculously complicated piece of anatomical machinery. At first glance, it’s a confusing tangle of tendons, nerves, and ligaments all crammed into a tiny, unforgiving space. But here’s the secret: it’s not. At its heart, the elbow is just a simple hinge with a few tricky cables attached. This guide is designed to demystify its key regions for ultrasound-guided injections, stripping away the complexity so you can see the simple truths underneath. Our goal is to transform fear and uncertainty into clarity and confidence, proving that with the right mental map—and a bit of humor—any clinician can master this joint.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1.0 The Big Picture: The Overworked Shipping Dock

Before we dive into the anatomical weeds, let's zoom out. The single most important concept to grasp about chronic elbow pain is that it's almost always a problem of mechanical overload. The joint itself is fine; it's the structures attached to it that are screaming for help. Understanding this fundamental problem—overloaded tendons—is the key to mastering every intervention that follows.

1.1 The Analogy

Let’s make this cartoon simple. Imagine the bony bumps on either side of your elbow—the epicondyles—are two busy shipping docks. The tendons that attach here are the main loading ropes that your forearm muscles use to haul cargo (like lifting a coffee cup or swinging a golf club). ""Tennis elbow"" and ""golfer's elbow"" are just fancy medical terms for what happens when these ropes become frayed, disorganized, and weak from constant, repetitive loading. The chronic pain you feel is simply the dock foreman screaming that one of his main ropes is about to snap.

1.2 Our Mission

Our mission, should we choose to accept it, is to use our ultrasound probe as a high-tech camera to find the exact frayed, damaged section of rope. Once we've pinpointed the problem, we can guide our needle in and deliver a ""repair package"" (the injection) precisely where it's needed most—without accidentally poking a hole in any other important electrical cables or support beams.

With that in mind, let's head over to the first, and busiest, shipping dock: the lateral side.

2.0 The Lateral Elbow: Taming the ""Tennis Elbow"" Beast

Welcome to the lateral elbow, the Grand Central Station of elbow pain. This is, by far, the most common site of trouble, and learning to navigate its anatomy with precision is what separates the skilled practitioner from one who inadvertently creates bigger, more complicated problems.

2.1 The Cast of Characters

Let's meet the key players on the lateral side:

* The Common Extensor Tendon (CET): Picture a perpetually stressed-out, overworked office manager. He's constantly being pulled in a dozen different directions by his muscle employees—especially the Extensor Carpi Radialis Brevis, which is almost always the main source of the trouble. After years of this abuse, his fibers are frayed, disorganized, and he's screaming for a long-overdue break. This is our target.
* The Lateral Epicondyle (LE): This is the CET's tiny, bony, and completely unforgiving boss. It’s the anchor point where all the stress converges, and it offers no sympathy.
* The Radial Collateral Ligament (RCL): This is the quiet, stoic, and incredibly important security guard standing just beneath the CET's office floor. He's the main stabilizer for the joint. He is strong and silent, but he really doesn't appreciate being accidentally stabbed with ligament-weakening steroids.

2.2 Clinical Pearl: Don't Stab the Security Guard

Let’s imagine a scenario. It's 3 AM, you’re tired, and you’re injecting a nagging case of tennis elbow. You think you’re helping the tendinopathy, but your needle goes a few millimeters too deep. You've just injected a potent, tissue-weakening steroid directly into the radial collateral ligament—the very structure that keeps the joint from wobbling apart. Good job. Now, instead of a simple tendinopathy, you have a much bigger problem of joint instability. The ultrasound is your superpower here; it lets you see the clear difference between the frayed tendon (the target) and the pristine ligament just below it (the no-go zone).

2.3 Memory Aids

* Mnemonic: To keep the key players on your mental checklist, just remember this: ""Lazy Elephants Can't Eat Tacos Riding Cold Llamas."" (Lateral Epicondyle, Common Extensor Tendon, Radial Collateral Ligament).
* Visualization: Imagine a cartoon where our stressed-out CET office manager is sitting at his desk, and a giant needle pokes through the ceiling. Just below his floorboards, the RCL security guard looks up with a nervous expression, polishing his badge and hoping the needle doesn't come any lower.

Now that we've managed the extensor side, let's walk around to the medial side, where a whole new set of challenges awaits in Golfer's Gulch.

3.0 The Medial Elbow: Navigating Golfer's Gulch

The medial elbow is less frequently injured than its lateral counterpart, but it demands even greater respect. Why? Because it’s home to a critical, high-risk structure that can turn a routine procedure into a disaster if you’re not paying attention. Here, precision is not just a goal; it's a requirement.

3.1 The Cast of Characters

Let's meet the crew on the medial dock:

* The Common Flexor Tendon (CFT): This is the tough, gritty counterpart to the CET. This is the ""pulling"" rope on the shipping dock, responsible for flexion and heavy lifting. Like the CET, it can get frayed and angry.
* The Medial Epicondyle (ME): This is the other dock—the CFT's bony anchor point.
* The Ulnar Nerve (UN): This is the undisputed star of the show. Portray it as a high-strung, prima-donna electrical wire. It is incredibly sensitive, hates being touched, and is known for being annoyingly unpredictable. Sometimes, it likes to ""sublux,"" or jump out of its protective groove behind the epicondyle, and sunbathe right on top of it—directly in your needle's path.

3.2 Clinical Pearl: Always Check for the Wandering Nerve

So, you're about to inject the Common Flexor Tendon, feeling confident. You've identified the tendon and the bone. But wait—did you check on our prima donna, the Ulnar Nerve? You must dynamically scan the area, flexing and extending the patient's elbow, to see where that nerve is living today. If it has decided to pop over the epicondyle (sublux), you're not aiming at a tendon anymore; you're about to harpoon the nerve responsible for hand sensation and movement. This is the definition of an unforced error. Always, always check where the nerve is before you advance your needle.

3.3 Memory Aids

* Mnemonic: To remember the medial players, especially the one that matters most, think: ""My Elephant Can't Find The Unusual Narwhal."" (Medial Epicondyle, Common Flexor Tendon, Ulnar Nerve).
* Visualization: Picture the medial epicondyle as a bony hill. The ulnar nerve is a bright yellow electrical cord with a panicked face. Sometimes it lies safely in its trench behind the hill (the retro-condylar position), but sometimes it leaps right over the top, just as a giant needle approaches from the sky.

Having navigated the hazards on both sides of the joint, let's discuss what we're actually loading into that needle.

4.0 The Injection Showdown: Choosing Your Weapon

Getting the needle to the right spot is only half the battle. Choosing what to inject is a critical decision with long-term consequences. The literature gives us a clear look at the contenders, and the choice isn't as simple as just grabbing the first vial you see.

4.1 Analyze the Contenders

Think of the different injectates as fighters in a ring:

* Corticosteroid: The Flashy Brawler. This is the fighter who comes out swinging. Steroids offer fast, powerful, and impressive short-term pain relief. The problem? They can come with a cost. The literature suggests they may weaken tendons and ligaments over time. In fact, one major study by Coombes et al. found that at one year, patients receiving steroid injections had a lower rate of complete recovery (83%) than those who received anesthetic alone (96%). Worse, the steroid group didn't just have a lower recovery rate than a placebo; they recovered less often than patients who just got a shot of numbing medicine. This suggests the steroid itself may be an active impediment to long-term healing.
* Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) / Whole Blood: The Methodical Strategist. This fighter is slower and less dramatic but plays the long game. These biologic agents work by stimulating the body's own healing and repair mechanisms. The results aren't immediate, but they are often more durable. A study by Mishra et al. showed an 84% success rate with PRP, while another by Suresh et al. showed significant, lasting improvement with whole blood injections for chronic medial elbow pain.

4.2 The Goldberg Verdict

Here’s the bottom line: For a quick fix to cool down a raging fire, steroids are tempting. But for a chronic, smoldering problem where the goal is true healing and avoiding recurrence, the evidence points toward the biological agents. PRP and whole blood appear to be the smarter, albeit slower, bet for rebuilding the frayed rope rather than just silencing the foreman's screams.

Writing this as a millenial woman who grew up a shy introvert but is now socially comfortable. 

Majority people are GenZs here & you guys are wayy smarter than I am when it comes to online communities. Yet, I wish there were more females participating in the meetups, so writing this. I have had my fair share of online friendships being an introvert , started with Orkut and now since majority of my friends have moved out, building friendships via Reddit. 

Here are my tips to safely meet people from online communities as platonic friends (especially Reddit as identities are masked here):
1. Chat to filter people: If there's even slightest hint of creepiness or shady feeling (your gut is usually right with these signals), don't meet 
2. Share limited personal data: Instead of handing out instagram handle, phone number right away. Either coordinate through Reddit msging itself or share Telegram or something that masks your personal identity. Whatever platform you decide on, check it often before meeting (once my notifications were off and I accidentally stood someone up)
3. Communicate : Coordinating with people requires clear communication on time, place, ETA, status of meet, etc. Fear may make you inclined towards ghosting, don't do that. Just let them know you can't make it. Ghosting gives you fake ego boost or relief, but clear communication is the real flex.
4. Create Safety Ritual : I usually follow this thumb rule, I meet people at public place, preferably a cafe, and during daytime and without intoxicants. It helps to keep you safe and in control. You can always leave if you feel uncomfortable. Share your location with a close friend before leaving, have a safe word with them, so they can call you to escape the situation. 
5. Split the bill (optional): Usually it's a safer bet to split the bill the first time at least . People think in a transactional manner so this is usually better. Some people are very generous and genuinely kind but some keep a mental score. I genuinely do not prefer being called a gold digger over a cup of coffee.
6. Expect the disappointment: Even after all th precautions, some meets may not turn out to be as interesting as you expected, or you may get some unpleasant experiences. Learn from them and improve the next time.

And dear men, a little tip, be less eager (read desperate) and your first msg to anyone should explain the reason for your msg, your age and gender. This makes your DMs less creepy.

This is now her absolute LAST chance to make serious money fast, IMHO.  Everything else has failed.  ""As ever"" may not even stay in business to the end of 2026, and she is bored of it anyway.

A makeup line?  Who would fund it?  Who would buy it?  Who wants to look like her?  She *might* risk the little capital she and Harry have left, but it's a big risk.

She and Haznoballs are offering themselves up as dinner guests at $100,000 a clip, but the idea that they can make her desired kind of money doing that is laughable.

Plus, you know she is absolutely *dying* to clap back at every. single. criticism and accusation she's ever heard.  Surrogacy, moonbump, her father, her pre-Harry Soho House life, yachting, etc, etc, etc.

I wouldn't be a bit surprised if she has the whole book already in the can, ready to go, and is now preparing to offer it up to the highest bidder.  She won't care if it would embarrass Haznoballs.  Nor will she think ahead to how easily her claims might be disproven.  It will be a rushed-out mess.

She would have gotten a lot more money if she had done the book immediately after Megxit, but that ship has sailed.  Now she'd probably get a bigger payday if she waited until after she and Haznoballs divorce, but she is not known either for her patience or her sense of timing.

The cover will have a huge photo of her looking pensive, possibly with one tear falling from her left eye, and the title in ""calligraphy"", complete with death scythes.
