1nbyfnp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nbyfnp,Interior British Columbia Gravel Ride,"I had done the Galena Trail portion of this ride over 20 years ago and I was keen to return and explore more of the trail network around the Arrow-Slocan region. This area is perfect for gravel riding as there is an abundance of old rail trails that connect the towns (Nakusp to Slocan and beyond, although some spots you will have to ride on the highway until you can rejoin the trail network).¬†

The Hills to New Denver portion of this ride is insanely beautiful as you emerge from the thicker forested area onto the north end of Slocan Lake. From here there are countless beaches (most without a single person in sight) and the grade of the rail trail makes for a super relaxing ride into New Denver that you can do at your own pace. The trail meanders along the waterside until you pass through the small community of Rosebery and then shortly after that you are into New Denver.¬†

New Denver makes for the perfect stopover for lunch as there are quite a few cute little cafes and snack spots. I stopped over at a small spot called Gather Cafe and managed to catch some live music in the back while enjoying a sandwich and coffee before continuing on.

From here I made my way out of New Denver and up to Galena Trail which recently re-opened a very cool cable car that takes you and your bike across a river. Normally you could continue on this trail to a tiny ghost-town called Sandon but there was a pretty big washout shortly after the cable car so the trail was fully closed on this section. Feeling like I wanted to take a different route down, I had heard at the cafe that there was another way back to New Denver down Old Sandon Road. In hindsight this trail is better suited to a mountain bike but it is still definitely doable on a gravel bike and it does chill out a bit after an extremely bumpy and rooty top section. This little loop on Galena Trail and Old Sandon Road was a nice contrast to the super chill rail trail that follows the lake. If you want to avoid the rougher descent of Old Sandon Road you can just return across the cable car and down Galena Trail to New Denver.¬†

Finally I finished on the shores of Slocan Lake on the edge of downtown New Denver and the swim was the perfect way to finish a day of riding. There‚Äôs plenty of Airbnb‚Äôs, hotels, or places to camp in the area if you're looking for a stayover before you continue on.

Dear Agent:

I‚Äôm seeking an agent who shares my love of dark fantasy romance and horror. These Monstrous Desires is a dual-POV, new adult queer fantasy romance with dark humor and forbidden love, complete at 117,000 words. While suicide is a key element, the story is told through the lens of hope, love, and adventure. My goal is to explore mental health organically‚Äîwoven into a character-driven fantasy without naming it.

Prince Demetri is a monster who has struggled all his life against an insatiable hunger for human flesh. When he accidentally kills a friend, he swears to end his life before the beast inside rises again. But as the last immortal on earth, Demetri cannot die by most means. Desperate, he makes a deal with the one person who can help: his sister, the queen of monsters. Her price: dismantle mankind‚Äôs rule over their realm by assassinating the human prince, Levi.

Levi has a mission of his own. His family‚Äôs blood powers weapons that protect humans from monsters like Demetri. He has one year to find an alternative energy source, or his father will use his sister to manufacture these weapons‚Äîby strapping her to a magical, blood-sucking chair until she takes her final breath. Levi learns her only chance of survival lies in the blood of the last immortal: Prince Demetri.

When the prince of darkness meets the prince of light, desire and doom entwine. Disguised among Levi‚Äôs soldiers, Demetri begins to question his longing for death as he forges unlikely bonds‚Äîand falls for the very man he is fated to destroy. Levi‚Äôs heart is captured by Merrick, the mask Demetri wears, not knowing he is the monster Levi must hunt to save his sister. Their love is perilous, not only because Demetri craves Levi‚Äôs flesh, but because their destinies are bound in blood: for Demetri to die, he must kill Levi; for Levi to save his sister, he must capture Demetri alive.

These Monstrous Desires blends the slow-burn, enemies-to-lovers arc of Crier‚Äôs War with the dark fantasy themes of One Dark Window. I am a member of the Women‚Äôs Fiction Writers Association, Speculative Fiction Writers, and Horror Writers Association. I hold a BA in journalism with a minor in creative writing, and my background includes copywriting and a year-long creative writing fellowship culminating in a published short story.


Chapter 1: Demetri 

‚ÄúAll I ever wanted from life was death,‚Äù ‚Äî Excerpt from Demetri Stellalux‚Äôs private journal

Tonight, I was a liar‚Äîan imposter, a deceiver, a stealer of identities, pasts and cultures that didn‚Äôt belong to me. I wore them like a mask, and stitched them into the dark wool cloak thrown around my shoulders. 

Tonight, I was a horribly selfish liar.

I was also a bored liar with far too much time on my hands. Enough time that after spending centuries in near-solitude, I‚Äôd somehow convinced myself that visiting a few acquaintances this evening was a good idea. 

Even saying the words in my head felt strange. Words like visiting and acquaintances didn‚Äôt often cross my mind. It was like I was another person tonight. Someone that met up with old friends for a drink. Someone that had friends in the first place.

Someone who didn‚Äôt accidentally eat their friends alive on occasion. 

Clearly, my restlessness was bordering on desperation, because as soon as I stepped into this misty town of Dunsworth, filled with dozens of drunk, laughing humans, I knew I‚Äôd made a fatal mistake. 

Seedy taverns and small shops made from human bone lined the cobbled thoroughfare. Because this was a town of Necromancers‚Äîhumans that drew power from the dead. While much of this town was a homage to those no longer living, the people who inhabited it were alive and filled with excitement. They bustled around with their assorted meats on sticks, steaming cups of stew made from blood fungus‚Äîmushrooms that grew atop graves, and a variety of coffee that was brewed in the catacombs under the city.

I‚Äôll be moving to Texas, and from what I‚Äôve seen, the Muslim community there is really good, so I‚Äôm not anxious about finding someone. Honestly, I‚Äôm more confused about how to actually¬†*approach*¬†someone.

I interned in Texas this summer, and I went to this mosque called Qalam. They have their own community space called Roots Community Space, where they do halaqas for college students, game nights, and other activities. Its a cute little community center with a coffe shop!

I always lower my gaze and never really looked at any sisters when I was there. I don‚Äôt feel the need to gawk at every hijabi for potential marriage, but I did notice that there are a good number of sisters who are around my age, practicing, and my type.

Here‚Äôs the thing: I don‚Äôt have sisters, and my mom isn‚Äôt around either, so I don‚Äôt really have anyone to vet sisters for me. That probably means I‚Äôll have to take the initiative myself.

The community space also has a coffee shop, and I‚Äôve seen a lot of sisters sitting there. But it feels¬†*weird*¬†to approach them. I‚Äôm confident in myself, but I worry that if I approach someone, I might come across as desperate or not practicing enough. Especially because sisters want a shy, modest guy who lowers his gaze‚Äîbut at the same time, they want us to approach. It feels like such a limbo.

I‚Äôm also worried about rejection‚Äînot that I can‚Äôt handle rejection, life happens‚Äîbut more that if I do get rejected, she might spread the word in the community. Roots is a regular hangout spot, so I don‚Äôt want my name getting a reputation as ‚Äúthe guy who approaches everyone.‚Äù

Obviously, Roots is just one part of the puzzle, but it seems like my best shot.

1nbybuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/1nbybuj/a_blogpost_i_wrote_on_nonactionwu_wei/,A blogpost i wrote on non-action/Wu wei,"Today, I finally understood the principle of non-action or what the ‚ÄúTao Te Ching‚Äù calls ‚ÄúWu Wei‚Äù. Since reading the Tao Te Ching, I‚Äôve struggled with that concept, as it isn‚Äôt meant to stop you from doing things, but it literally tells you to practice non-action? That is seemingly a paradox‚Ä¶ right?

Today, I realized that it is not a paradox. I was removing coffee stains from an inhuman amount of coffee cops with salt and elbow grease‚Ä¶ when I realized that I was not the one doing the washing. My mind, or consciousness or focus or whatever you want to call it, was INSIDE the cup, I was washing. ‚ÄúI‚Äù was in my hands and in the cup, I was completely swallowed up, by the activity, to a point where it felt like ‚ÄúI‚Äù didn‚Äôt exist outside the washing. Like I forget my own body and mind, because I am doing something in mindfulness, in such a manner that I become one with the activity.

I was no longer the one washing the cup, I was observing that the cup was being washed, without meaning to do anything. When I was suddenly pulled out of this reverie, it just hit me‚Ä¶ now I understand this concept‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve tried it twice, the other time was while I was doing gardening at home. Most importantly - both times, was when I was focused on my breath and the activity and my hands and practicing mindfulness.

I see this as a huge breakthrough, because it shows me the key to the present and it proves to me, that what so many spiritual figures, books and philosophers try to point towards with words‚Ä¶ is real! but it is rather difficult to explain, in words‚Ä¶

This is the answer to many things, as the magic happens, when you‚Äôre in this state, because you‚Äôre doing something, but it is like a break. It doesn‚Äôt feel like effort, but like flowing. Time seems to stop and you no longer feel the aches and pains in the body or the thoughts that seem to loop around causing frustration or worry about the dentist appointment you have this afternoon.

It is like readily available bliss, peace, calm, tranquility‚Ä¶ in which the drama of life just disappears. It is the art of non-action. The art of Wu Wei. The art of being peaceful, while engaging in activity. Dare I say - the art of happiness?

Shout out to an influential figure in my life - Thich Nhat Hanh. I‚Äôve never met you, but your way of communicating these things, makes it easy to understand. Thank you Thay - may you rest in peace

1nby8g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nby8g2/all_the_pretty_things/,‚ÄúAll the Pretty Things‚Äù,"I am a reclusive old man living alone in the Appalachian wilderness, and I‚Äôve lived in my little cabin for the better part of 50 years without incident. However, recently, things have started showing up on my doorstep- and the contents are horrifying.

It started with a note. A sheet of notebook paper I found taped to my door one morning.

It read, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the pretty things that matter,‚Äù scrawled in black ink in large lettering across the page. On the back, there was a Polaroid. An off-kilter photo of what looked like a chest or box surrounded by trees.

A bit confused and unsettled, I set the note and photo on my coffee table and went on about my day, journaling and reading. There‚Äôs not much to do in the woods of Appalachia, so my days were usually spent enjoying nature, hunting, and fishing.

So that‚Äôs what I did, I finished my chapter and journal entry, then set off into the forest, rifle on my shoulder and fishing rod in hand.

The woods were eerily silent this day, which, if you know anything about Appalachia, is not a good sign. I was confident with my rifle, though, and hiked on, following the path to the river that I‚Äôd taken a million times before.

However, halfway through the hike, I discovered something that had not been on the trail before: A bloodied doll head was nailed through the forehead into a towering pine that swayed with the wind, its body nowhere to be found. Below the head, etched into the bark with what I assumed was a pocket knife, the phrase, ‚Äúisn‚Äôt she pretty?‚Äù jagged and messy.

Feeling the unease wash over me, I decided it was best I return home for the day. The forest remained silent as I trekked back to the cabin, and it felt as though a million eyes were on me with each step I took. I could feel the atmospheric pressure change as thunder clapped overhead and the first droplets of rain began to fall.

Making it back home, I locked up extra tight, placing a chair underneath my door handle and locking every window.

The storm raged that night, and the wind howled outside, rocking the cabin back and forth gently. I had slept with my rifle, being the paranoid recluse that I am, and because periodically throughout the night, I thought I could hear the sounds of footsteps pounding against my front porch- pacing back and forth along the tiny 4x5 space.

Life was brought to my fears when the next morning, I found a new gift at my doorstep: The tattered and dirty shirt that appeared to have belonged to a little girl, between the ages of 4 and 8.

In denial, I tried rationalizing the experience by telling myself the weather had blown the shirt onto the porch, the wind had swept it up and carried it miles just for it to settle directly on my front porch. An attempt for me to walk away from the situation.

However, that rationalization quickly crumbled when I picked up the shirt, and beneath it lay another Polaroid photo:

A little girl standing at a bus stop, oblivious. The same pink and purple butterflies on her shirt as the ones on the shirt I now held in my hands. On the back, in black Sharpie and neat handwriting was the phrase, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she pretty?‚Äù with a smiley face underneath.

I immediately loaded up into my old Ford Ranger and made my way to the closest police station, presenting them with the evidence. Looking into their missing persons database, they found a match for the girl in the picture. Only she had gone missing over 30 years ago, and her case had gone cold after about 15 years.

I explained the events to the police, with the doll‚Äôs head and the photo of the chest that I had received two nights ago, and they told me everything I already knew about Appalachia: how people go missing up here by the thousands every year, and how an absurd number of the cases go unsolved. Nevertheless, they assured me they‚Äôd examine the Polaroid for fingerprints and get back to me if they found any clues.

Being a gun owner, I refused any police protection at my residence, and I myself assured them that I too would be keeping a close eye out for any suspicious-looking person lurking near my remote cabin.

When I returned home, everything was just as I left it. No signs of any kind of trespassing or vandalism. I stayed in again this night, wanting to be here in case any more gifts arrived on my doorstep.

While I was at my stove cooking that night, through the sound of my radio playing 70‚Äôs rock music, I heard the creeping footsteps again on my front porch.

I rushed to grab the rifle from my bedroom and came bursting through the front door to find the sight of a pale, sickly-thin man, crouched down and peering into my kitchen window, Polaroid camera strapped around his neck. He was completely nude and bald-headed, and once he saw me, he screeched like an animal before springing over the baluster.

I fired blind shots as he fled at inhuman speed into the woods, leaving shrubbery and branches shaking as he sprinted. I fired another shot into the forest in his direction and heard another screech, but the sprinting persisted. I leaped from the porch and chased as fast as I could through the dense forest, stumbling over roots and running into trees in the darkness.

I could no longer hear the footsteps, so I gave up and walked back to the cabin, defeated.

I did not sleep a wink that night. The whole evening was spent on my porch, waiting for him to come back. Next time, I would not miss. I waited until the sun came up, and no trace of the man returned.

Becoming fluent in hunting during my time here in these woods, my first idea was to search for his blood. I had heard him screech again; I could‚Äôve at least grazed an arm, and I could work from that.

I searched the whole area and found no sign of blood anywhere.

Defeated, I returned to the cabin. I went into town that day and bought some trail cameras that I placed around the area and on my porch. I was not going to miss my opportunity to catch or kill this guy again.

Days came and went with no sign of the man. My trail cams caught nothing, and gifts stopped appearing on my doorstep. Days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months. I had almost succumbed and settled back into my life of comfort and serenity alone on my mountain until one faithful morning.

A new gift was on my porch. Not only that, but doll heads were nailed to every tree surrounding the perimeter. It wasn‚Äôt just doll heads, either. Limbs were separated from the torsos and crudely nailed to the trees, making them look like dissected bodies.

The same message under each display:

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt she pretty?‚Äù

The new gift was a jewelry box, dusty and decaying. Inside were dozens of rusted and bloodied earrings, each one bearing some variation of a butterfly.

After this, things escalated faster than I could account for.

I took the jewelry box to the police station and yet again explained the situation to the local police chief. The earrings were taken in for DNA examination, and as the earrings were being removed, a new Polaroid was found underneath the pile.

It was me, asleep in my bed, completely unaware, taken from beyond my bedroom window.

The chief insisted I have police protection at my cabin, and this time I agreed. This man had managed to find the one blind spot in my trail cams, and now he was toying with me.

DNA testing takes anywhere between 24 and 72 hours, so once more, I returned to the cabin, officers at my rear.

As you‚Äôd imagine, it‚Äôs difficult for me to park my Ranger on my property, let alone two additional police cars. That being said, the officers had to park their cruisers on the dirt road at the end of the driveway. The two officers stayed in their cars the whole night, rendering them nearly useless. That‚Äôs what makes what happened next so frustrating.

It had started to storm again, and lightning strikes flooded the cabin with flashing light every few seconds. Something was off, though, the strikes seemed‚Ä¶out of sync with the storm.

I focused in on this and noticed that there would be three quick flashes of light after every big flash of light, and then there‚Äôd be thunder.

Lightning struck again, and in the living room window, the outline of the man came into view. Three flashes came from his face before the outside went dark again.

Once again, I ran outside, rifle in hand, but this time the man was gone completely, without a trace.

Immediately, I confronted the cops in their useless cars, demanding they help search the area. They dared to seem annoyed with me as we searched the woods in the pouring rain.

Finding nothing, the officers returned to their vehicles. By this point, it was around 4 in the morning, and the storm began to let up. Against my better judgment, I allowed myself rest.

I awoke to sunshine and birds singing, a stunning contrast to the previous night.

Stepping onto my porch, in place of a gift, I found dozens of Polaroids of myself arranged into the shape of a butterfly.

Right in the center of the collage, I found something that broke me.

My daughter, laughing as I pushed her on the swing. As happy as could be.

25 years ago, she had gone missing from our front yard as my wife and I worked around the house.

Her disappearance broke me and my wife apart, and we divorced soon after, leading me to move here, into this cabin.

I felt my heart break all over again, and I began to break down. I was absolutely grimaced to find that the police cars were no longer at the end of my driveway and were nowhere to be found.

I lost my mind. I stomped through the forest screaming at the top of my lungs for the man to reveal himself, for him to show himself to me, and to stop being such a coward.

The forest had grown silent again, aside from the sound of leaves rustling around me. The noise surrounded me as if something were running in circles around me, studying me. I couldn‚Äôt even discern where it ended, but when it did, it was immediately replaced with a single sound:

My shroud of sanity fell, and I fired shots wildly in all directions. I listened as the unnaturally fast footsteps raced off deeper into the forest, laughing like a banshee.

This was the last I saw of the man for a while. DNA evidence from the earrings came back as a match for 36 different missing children from the 80s and 90s. This time, a whole team came up to my little cabin and searched extensively for miles.

Unbelievably, a warrant was served for the search of the cabin itself, which I obliged, too tired to care.

The search went on for months, and nothing was found. I‚Äôd stare at the pictures of the man, naked on my trail camera, and burning hatred filled my heart. Murderous resentment that would keep me awake at night.

The last gift the man has left me was his box from the first Polaroid he ever gave me.

A traveler‚Äôs trunk that you‚Äôd see on a train, across the top, the phrase ‚ÄúAll the pretty things.‚Äù

I opened it to find dozens of doll heads along with dismembered arms and legs made from hollow plastic. I found a variety of clothing, all with butterflies stitched into the fabric. But above all, I found pictures of dozens of little girls, none older than 12.

Blood speckled the top of the pile, and I wanted to throw up, staring into the case.

I kneeled there over the box, completely lost for words and in a trance for what felt like hours. The one thing that snapped me out of this state was when I heard the rustling of leaves off in the distance, followed by a sound that broke me:

1nby8by,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mindfulness/comments/1nby8by/a_little_blogpost_i_wrote_on_mindfulness_and/,A little blogpost i wrote on mindfulness and non-action,"Today, I finally understood the principle of non-action or what the ‚ÄúTao Te Ching‚Äù calls ‚ÄúWu Wei‚Äù. Since reading the Tao Te Ching, I‚Äôve struggled with that concept, as it isn‚Äôt meant to stop you from doing things, but it literally tells you to practice non-action? That is seemingly a paradox‚Ä¶ right?

Today, I realized that it is not a paradox. I was removing coffee stains from an inhuman amount of coffee cops with salt and elbow grease‚Ä¶ when I realized that I was not the one doing the washing. My mind, or consciousness or focus or whatever you want to call it, was INSIDE the cup, I was washing. ‚ÄúI‚Äù was in my hands and in the cup, I was completely swallowed up, by the activity, to a point where it felt like ‚ÄúI‚Äù didn‚Äôt exist outside the washing. Like I forget my own body and mind, because I am doing something in mindfulness, in such a manner that I become one with the activity.

I was no longer the one washing the cup, I was observing that the cup was being washed, without meaning to do anything. When I was suddenly pulled out of this reverie, it just hit me‚Ä¶ now I understand this concept‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve tried it twice, the other time was while I was doing gardening at home. Most importantly - both times, was when I was focused on my breath and the activity and my hands and practicing mindfulness.

I see this as a huge breakthrough, because it shows me the key to the present and it proves to me, that what so many spiritual figures, books and philosophers try to point towards with words‚Ä¶ is real! but it is rather difficult to explain, in words‚Ä¶

This is the answer to many things, as the magic happens, when you‚Äôre in this state, because you‚Äôre doing something, but it is like a break. It doesn‚Äôt feel like effort, but like flowing. Time seems to stop and you no longer feel the aches and pains in the body or the thoughts that seem to loop around causing frustration or worry about the dentist appointment you have this afternoon.

It is like readily available bliss, peace, calm, tranquility‚Ä¶ in which the drama of life just disappears. It is the art of non-action. The art of Wu Wei. The art of being peaceful, while engaging in activity. Dare I say - the art of happiness?

Shout out to an influential figure in my life - Thich Nhat Hanh. I‚Äôve never met you, but your way of communicating these things, makes it easy to understand. Thank you Thay - may you rest in peace

I'm open to playing most games, especially co-op titles but actively **avoid** playing MMOs, MOBAs or any competitive shooters. Perhaps you could suggest a game we might enjoy together?

* **SOCIALIZING -** I‚Äôm a people person and always up for meeting and chatting with someone new. I love hosting screen shares for YouTube, movies, or shows, sending voice note updates instead of texts (sometimes), swapping random photos, and keeping the daily chatter going. I match whatever energy you bring, so if your style is never texting first or sending one-word replies‚Ä¶ yeah, we‚Äôre probably not a match üòÖ I'm also trying to better myself when it comes to confrontation...

***I'm usually available for voice calls / games in the evenings (9pm onwards GMT+1) or weekend mornings (8am - 4pm GMT+1), but otherwise I can text anytime!***

I explained that if I had eaten then it wouldn't of been in range so how can that be a test but he said he won't change his mind about treatment and tbh even if had prescribed he was a proper see you next tuesday.

1nby4nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nby4nx/assess_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_chulux/,Assess the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker CHULUX Worth Buying,"Compact, lightweight, and undeniably practical, the CHULUX CL-CM24002 coffee maker aims to fill your mornings with convenience and rich, aromatic coffee. Using it daily over the past week, I began appreciating the unique features that set it apart from other single-serve brewers. Whether it's a rushed weekday or a slow weekend, this compact machine consistently delivers a flavorful cup of coffee while influencing a small corner of my counter with its streamlined, space-efficient design.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about the machine was its minimalistic and sleek build. At just 4 inches wide, the coffee maker saves a ton of space but doesn‚Äôt compromise functionality. Its compact size made it perfect for my limited counter space, hinting that this device was designed with small kitchens, dorm rooms, and even RVs in mind. The build quality felt solid despite its lightweight 2.6 pounds, and the overall black finish added a modern flair. I especially liked the unique 4-hole needle structure, ensuring the capsules pierce evenly and deliver richer flavors. I won't lie; the design gives off the vibe of a premium brewer without the hefty price tag.

**Ease of Use and Usability**  
Brewing coffee couldn‚Äôt get simpler. This single-serve coffee brewer functions with a single button for operation, and believe me, nothing is more pleasant early in the morning than pressing a button and letting the machine do its job. It supports both K-cups (1.0 & 2.0 pods) as well as reusable coffee filters. I opted to test both options, and switching between them only took seconds. The customizable brew sizes, from 6 to 12 oz, made it convenient to prepare a stronger morning shot or a larger evening cup to relax. A removable drip tray adjusts to fit different mug sizes, including my 7.3‚Äù travel mug, which was a pleasant surprise since few coffee makers in this segment accommodate taller mugs.

**Rapid Brewing Time**  
I'm not a morning person, and waiting forever for coffee isn‚Äôt really my thing. This coffee maker‚Äôs brewing cycle impressed me with its speed‚Äîwithin just two minutes, it brewed my favorite K-cup to an ideal temperature of 190¬∞F. This rapid feature came in handy during hectic mornings, leaving enough time to catch my breath before heading out the door. The energy-efficient auto-off function added another layer of convenience, shutting off the machine after brewing and eliminating worries about leaving it on accidentally.

[Discover if CHULUX CL-CM24002 is on sale at Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0cvxq9bck/)

**Benefits**  
‚Ä¢ Ultralight and compact design perfect for tight spaces  
‚Ä¢ Fits a variety of mug sizes, including taller travel mugs  
‚Ä¢ Rapid brewing cycle ensures coffee is ready in minutes  
‚Ä¢ Compatible with both K-cups and ground coffee filters  
‚Ä¢ Adjustable settings allow 6-12 oz of personalized brew sizes  

**Flavor and Performance**  
If you're expecting half-decent coffee, you‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised. The unique 4-hole needle design extracts a noticeably richer flavor and aroma from coffee pods. I tested both dark roasts and flavored varieties, and each cup had a full-bodied taste with no weird after-flavors lingering. Even the reusable coffee grounds produced a satisfying brew, showing the machine‚Äôs versatility. While it‚Äôs no match for high-end espresso machines, within the world of single-serve drip brewers, it delivers solid results. Honestly, it feels like a machine made for people who just want good coffee without diving into fussy setups.

**Negatives**  
‚Ä¢ Limited to lower elevations (under 4,000 feet)  
‚Ä¢ Requires regular descaling to prevent clogging  
‚Ä¢ Brew size flexibility is limited compared to pricier models  

**Alternative Offerings**  
Pitting this coffee maker against other compact brewers, it holds its ground thanks to its sleek design and simplified functionality. Compared to the popular Keurig K-Mini, the CHULUX feels just as user-friendly but is notably smaller and lighter. While Keurig offers wider pod compatibility and slightly more advanced features, such as a stronger brew setting, the CHULUX focuses on simplicity and portability, making it a great budget-friendly alternative. Another strong competitor is the BLACK+DECKER Single Serve Coffee Maker, which sports a comparable price range but lacks the 4-hole needle design that highlights CHULUX‚Äôs flavor-enhancing capability.

**Affordable Quality**  
This coffee maker feels like great bang for your buck. It blends convenience and efficiency into a package that serves up quality coffee without overstepping its price tier. While it doesn‚Äôt boast all the sophisticated features found in premium models, its affordability more than justifies the trade-off. The lightweight and portability make it an excellent choice if you're someone who loves coffee on-the-go without sacrificing flavor. Just keep in mind that regular cleaning is necessary to maintain consistent performance and prevent clogs.

I started writing during those lab nights. It wasn‚Äôt a paper; it became a story. A thriller where the geology isn‚Äôt window dressing, where ash gums engines, roofs fail before lava matters, and timing is messy the way real eruptions are. The plot goes cosmic, but the ground truth stays honest.

If you‚Äôre a grad, a field tech, a prof, or just someone who‚Äôs had ash in their boots, would you be open to a sci-fi/mystery that treats volcanology with the respect you expect?

Chapter 49: Acceleration.

Earth 2092 15 years since the Swarm arrival.

Several months had passed since the arrival of the Hive technician. Several months that, for the Guard's key research centers, felt like a jump into hyperspace. A time in which humanity, led by the hand of an extraterrestrial mentor, made a technological leap that would have taken another long half-century under normal, peaceful conditions.

Mike, as he asked to be called, proved to be an invaluable, though unsettling, catalyst for progress. He did not sit on committees, write reports, or participate in political councils. His methods were direct and absolutely effective. He wandered from one research center to another, from the orbital shipyards where the hulls of new battleships were being welded, to the terrestrial factories in Nevada and Siberia where quantum computer cores were produced in sterile conditions. His physical presence, a slender, pearlescent silhouette moving silently among human machines, was in itself a motivating factor. But it was his knowledge and his way of imparting it that broke down barriers.

He did not give traditional lectures. He would enter a laboratory where a team of the best physicists had been struggling for weeks with the problem of plasma instability in a new type of reactor, stand in silence, and his large, multifaceted eyes would seem to analyze each of them individually. And then, in a calm, synthetic voice that appeared directly in the minds of the engineers and scientists, he would personally explain the most intricate theories of trans-standard physics. He used no analogies or simplifications. He projected pure, elegant, terrifyingly complex equations and three-dimensional models of quantum fields into their consciousness. He showed them mental shortcuts, pointed out fundamental errors in their reasoning that stemmed from the limitations of their three-dimensional perception, and opened doors for them to perceive realities they never knew existed.

Most of Earth's greatest minds listened to him with a mixture of reverent awe and profound bewilderment. They were like first-grade students to whom a brilliant professor was trying to explain the theory of relativity. They could barely follow his train of thought, grasping only fragments, single concepts that in themselves were enough to make a breakthrough in their field. Working with Mike was intellectually humiliating, but incredibly productive.
But there was one exception.
The scene took place in the main auditorium of the research center in Nevada. The hall was filled to the brim with the world's leading physicists. Mike, standing on stage before a huge holographic screen, was presenting the concept of the fourth generation of fusion reactors, the so-called ""suns in a box."" The problem was no longer initiating and sustaining the reaction. The problem was the efficiency of energy conversion.

""Your current models,"" Mike's voice explained in their heads, ""are based on thermal heat exchange. The plasma heats a medium, which drives turbines. This method is primitive and wasteful. There is a possibility of direct conversion of gamma radiation and neutrinos into usable electrical energy. However, this requires the use of a medium that is both a superconductor and capable of a controlled quantum state change when bombarded with high-energy particles.""
An equation appeared on the screen. A long, beautiful, and, for almost everyone in the room, absolutely incomprehensible string of symbols that described the behavior of a new, liquid nano-silicon alloy that the Hive used in its reactors. The entire room fell silent in a sense of deep, intellectual helplessness. They saw the mountain peak, but they had no idea how to climb it.
And then, out of the silence, a single voice asked a question. It was not a question of clarification. It was a question of elaboration. Of implication.

""Mike‚Ä¶ if this alloy is able to maintain quantum coherence in such extreme temperature and radiation conditions, does that mean we can completely bypass the thermal exchange phase? Can we, by modulating the reactor's magnetic field, induce a direct, controlled state change in the alloy itself, so that as it flows through the coils, it generates the current itself? Can your alloy be both the coolant and the generator?""
The voice belonged to Aris Thorne.
Mike stopped his presentation. His triangular head slowly turned toward the source of the question. His large, multifaceted eyes, which until now had swept across the entire room, focused solely on the admiral's brother. A silence so profound fell in the room that one could only hear the hum of the ventilation systems. At that moment, everyone understood that they were witnessing something exceptional. The two greatest physicists in the Solar System‚Äîone from Earth, the other from the stars‚Äîhad established a connection that was inaccessible to anyone else.

""Correct, Dr. Thorne,"" Mike finally replied, and in his voice, for the first time, there was something akin to‚Ä¶ interest. ""That is precisely the next logical step in this technology. I did not anticipate us reaching this topic for another three of your months. Your ability to extrapolate theoretical models is‚Ä¶ highly non-standard. Please, come forward. Let us explore the implications of this solution for your battleship designs together.""

Aris Thorne, slightly stunned but with his eyes burning with excitement, stood up and walked towards the stage. He wasn't just keeping up. He understood. He saw the forest while others were still lost among the trees. He had an innate, natural talent for perceiving the fundamental laws of the universe, but now that talent was enhanced, accelerated. The Hive nanite treatment he had undergone to cure his radiation sickness after the incident on the ""Pioneer"" had not only halted his aging. It had optimized his neural network, increasing the speed and clarity of his thought, removing biological limitations. His mind had become a powerful tool, capable of operating on a level that was dangerously close to that of his new teacher.
From that day on, Aris Thorne became Mike's primary intellectual partner on Earth. They worked together, often in seclusion, in Aris's private laboratory in Nevada. But Aris was not alone. At his side, as an equal partner, stood his wife.

Elara, after passing the most rigorous security clearances in the Guard with flying colors, had joined his team as one of the project's first and foremost physicists. Her mind, though not as abstract and intuitive as Aris's, was incredibly analytical and pragmatic. She was an engineer at heart. She could take the most esoteric theories from Aris and Mike and forge them into working, practical solutions. Together, they formed a duo that drove the progress of the entire fleet construction program at a pace that made even Admiral Thorne's head spin.
Their laboratory was their sanctuary. A vast, underground space filled with holographic tables, intelligent glass walls on which they sketched equations, and the quiet hum of a private quantum computer connected directly to the Hive. They spent their days and nights there, often forgetting to eat or sleep, fueled only by coffee and the pure, unbridled joy of discovery.

Their work was like a dance. Aris would throw a new, wild idea onto the table, sketching complex patterns in the air. Elara would immediately catch its weak points, point out material problems, energy limitations. They argued, debated, finished each other's sentences, and then, in a sudden flash of insight, they would find a solution that was a synthesis of their two minds‚Äîbrilliant in its theory and elegant in its execution.
It was a golden time for them. A time of professional triumph and rediscovered intimacy, cemented by a shared passion. But this triumph had its dark, personal price. A price they tried not to think about, but which always lurked in the background, like a quiet, ticking clock.

One evening, as twilight settled in the laboratory and they, in a state of elation, were just finishing sketching new equations on the holographic table‚Äîequations that, if their calculations were correct, could double the efficiency of the reactors in the ""Thor""-class battleships‚Äîa discreet, pulsing notification appeared on Aris's personal terminal. It was the quarterly progress report from the Guard Candidate Training Center.

Their joyous, excited conversations ceased immediately. Elara placed a hand on her husband's shoulder, and her smile vanished, replaced by an expression of concern. Aris hesitated for a moment, his finger hovering over the icon. Opening this report was like voluntarily inflicting pain upon himself. But he had to do it. He was their father.
He opened it. A short, several-minute video recording, devoid of sound, appeared on the screen.

The camera, likely from an observation drone, showed a brutal training ground, modeled after the rocky wastelands of one of Saturn's moons. The scenery was stark, in shades of gray and black, illuminated by the harsh, cold light of a simulated, distant sun. A group of twenty recruits in simple, gray Guard training uniforms was navigating a murderous obstacle course.

Aris and Elara immediately recognized two of them. Young people in their twenties, no longer the children they remembered. It was Kael and Lyra. Their children.
15 years and six months had passed since the Swarm arrival. Kael was now 28, Lyra was 26.
They were dirty, sweaty, their faces smeared with synthetic mud, and their bodies were covered in bruises and scrapes. They were exhausted to the limit, but in their movements, in the way they overcame each obstacle, there was a new, hard, relentless determination. This was no longer youthful energy. This was trained, brutal efficiency.

Aris watched as his son, Kael, whom he remembered as a slender, pensive boy with his nose in an Xbox 17 console, was now a lean, muscular young man. With incredible strength and agility, he scaled a high, icy wall, and then, without wasting a second, turned and extended a hand to his sister.
Lyra, his daughter, always small and stubborn, was climbing behind him, her bleeding fingers slipping on the cold handholds. Just as she was about to fall, Kael's hand grabbed her forearm and with a powerful jerk, he pulled her to the top. They stood there for a second, panting heavily, and exchanged a brief, emotionless nod. It was not a gesture of sibling love. It was the gesture of two soldiers from the same unit, helping each other survive another day in hell.

Beneath the recording was a short, text-based report. ""Cadet Kael Thorne: Progress in line with expectations. Demonstrates above-average physical strength and leadership abilities under combat stress. Still working on subordinating individual initiative to Guard protocols."" ""Cadet Lyra Thorne: Exceptional resistance to pain and fatigue. Marksmanship scores place her in the top five percent of her class. Exhibits tendencies toward solitary action; further work on team integration required.""

Aris looked at those words and at the image of his children, and his heart was torn between excruciating pain and a monstrous, shameful pride. He had forced them down this path. So they would have the chance to live for 1000 years. Fate had left them only one path to receive the nanites, to save them from time and disease‚Äîthe infantry. The hardest, most brutal, and most dangerous service. And they were passing the test he had set for them. They were becoming strong. They were becoming tough. They were becoming soldiers. His brother's soldiers.

He slowly tore his gaze from the screen and looked at Elara. Her beautiful face was pale, and in her eyes, which just moments before had shone with the joy of discovery, tears now welled. Her smile was gone, replaced by an expression of boundless sorrow. She didn't have to say anything. He understood.
And then his gaze fell upon the complex equations shimmering on the holographic table. The equations that were meant to give his brother's battleships even more power. The equations that were supposed to help win the war. The war to which he was sending his own children.

He had achieved his goal. He was saving his family, giving them the gift of immortality. But he was doing it by transforming them into perfect, faceless cogs in the war machine he was so passionately helping to build. And looking at his wife's face and the specter of his children on the screen, for the first time in his life, this brilliant, rational man of science had no idea if what he had done was salvation, or the worst damnation imaginable.

Making Hebrew accessible, easy, and fun for everyone who wants to learn it.

Hebrew learning doesn't have to be intimidating. 

It doesn't have to be boring. 

It doesn't have to be something that only certain people can master.

Whether you find me from a coffee shop, your living room, or anywhere in the world, my goal is the same - 

To show you that Hebrew can be different. 

It can be clear. 

It can click. 

It can actually be enjoyable.

I've spent years breaking down every barrier that keeps people from connecting with Hebrew. 

I've created methods that work with how your brain actually learns, not against it.

That person who's been putting off learning Hebrew because they think it's too hard? 

That's who I'm here for.

The one who tried apps and gave up?

I've built something so much better for them.

The person who wants to connect with the culture but doesn't know where to start? 

This is their bridge.

Every lesson I create, every method I develop, every student I help - 

It's all part of making Hebrew truly accessible to anyone who wants to learn it.

The feedback I got was from someone that just definitely didn't understand the point, and actively tore me apart. 

This was decades ago and I was only 19. Maybe I should try the same prompt again, or one of you can? 

It was:

Ghost, smoke, passion





---

Pinewood forest lodge. I didn‚Äôt die here, and become a ghost, like you'd read in an old tale. No, I‚Äôm a familiar face, not a stranger. You know exactly who I am.

It was already dark when we arrived here. Tall trees leant in and argued amongst themselves, birds took turns scaring each other into flight and wind whipped at the edges of the A-frame roof. You pulled off your hat and gloves. The fire flickered into life, and when the coffee hit your lips, I leant forward and flexed my fingers, smiled. 

But you didn‚Äôt write, like you came here to do. As you promised. The hours dropped away and I watched with ever growing bitterness.

That‚Äôs all I wanted. I was a dream that never came to be. I could smell the smoke from the fire, until I couldn‚Äôt. I could feel the cool plastic of the laptop keys, and taste the sweet wine. 

You gave up on me, and so I retreated from you. 

I wasn‚Äôt a victim of some axe-murdering psychopath.

I was the victim of you. 

You promised me a story. 

Well I'll have my story and you'll take centre stage.

*I was one of your great dreams.*

You were passionate about me. You let me become a ghost. 

I am regret, and I promise you‚Äôll suffer me forever.

We were never super close, but we were in the same friend group and had a lot of good memories.

After catching up, we started hanging out again, grabbing coffee, brunch, that sort of thing. A few weeks ago, she invited me to her engagement party. I was excited to go‚Äîuntil I met her fianc√©.

He‚Äôs Liam (30M), and the second I saw him, my stomach dropped. Liam and I had a very casual FWB (friends with benefits) situation during my last year of college, about six years ago. It wasn‚Äôt serious, we never dated, and we were both very clear about that. It lasted maybe six months, and we lost contact after I graduated.

He clearly recognized me too, and we exchanged an awkward but polite hello. I played it cool and didn‚Äôt bring anything up at the party.

Later, Liam messaged me privately and asked if I was planning to say anything to Jess. I told him no, that it was ancient history and none of my business unless he had lied about something to her. He said he hadn‚Äôt, but he also hadn‚Äôt volunteered the info, and he ‚Äúwould prefer‚Äù I didn‚Äôt say anything. I said fine‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt planning to.

Fast-forward to last weekend. I was at Jess‚Äôs apartment helping her address wedding invites. Out of nowhere, she asks, ‚ÄúDid you and Liam know each other before the party?‚Äù I froze for a second but kept it vague, just said we‚Äôd crossed paths in college. She stared at me and asked point-blank if we had hooked up. I didn‚Äôt want to lie to her face, so I admitted we had, but it was casual and a long time ago.

She got really upset. She said she felt humiliated that I‚Äôd been to her engagement party without telling her, that I‚Äôd been hanging out with her while ‚Äúkeeping this huge thing‚Äù from her, and that now she didn‚Äôt know who to trust.

I tried to explain that I hadn‚Äôt lied, and I didn‚Äôt think it was relevant since it was years ago and we had no emotional connection. But she basically told me I should‚Äôve told her the second I realized who Liam was, and then left it up to her how to handle it. She‚Äôs now taking space from me and hasn‚Äôt responded to my last message.

Liam also messaged me again and told me I made things worse by admitting it and that I ‚Äúshould‚Äôve just kept quiet.‚Äù

I just went through a super intense emotional rollercoaster with someone I became interested in. I have not dated for almost 3 years and the last relationship was extremely abusive. I literally had to flee for my life and sanity. I have chosen to be single and not date until it feels right. Well, I met someone recently through work and they were so sweet, so kind, so present. It felt safe to extend my hand. I did something I have never done before.

I sent them flowers at their workplace and included my number with a no pressure invitation to grab coffee or lunch together sometime. They reciprocated in a way that was far beyond my wildest expectations. Heart emojis everywhere. The excitement was palpable. They suggested a morning coffee date. They showed up a bit overdressed but eager to get to know me. I FUMBLED literally every portion of the date. From not giving them a hug upon greeting, to not complimenting them, to going into a self absorbed spiral of not so positive topics that should never have been part of a first date. They still hugged me at the end of it, and I responded like a frozen statue, unable to give normal human affection to someone I liked tremendously. And like that, all desire on their part died.

I knew the likelihood of a second date was slim but asked the next day anyway and inevitably got rejected. They told me their ""plate is full"" and that they were ""not in a place to hangout"". This was literally overnight. All enthusiasm died the moment we had to actually interact for a prolonged period.  I was absolutely shattered and destroyed myself with self blame for how I had behaved with someone I liked so much but would never get the chance to see again. They were different in every possible way to the abusive immature clowns I have normally dated. They had substance. Both inner and outer beauty. I COMPLETELY FAILED at showing them how much I truly liked them because I was FROZEN inside myself the entire time, unable to get out. I felt terrible that I left them feeling rejected or like I had ""tricked"" them (something I have heard often from others) by being the total opposite of those grand gestures and sparkly texts in person.

It was NOT my intention to trick this person. But I am literally locked inside myself emotionally and unable to get out, in a way that is extremely painful to both myself and the person experiencing me. I imagine they were completely confused, as anyone would be. I need time to open up and let those walls down. Much more time than the average person is willing to give. I have been abused, abandoned, and betrayed by so many people throughout my life, first and foremost my own family, that I have no ability to trust others or let them in, even when I want that so badly it hurts. I don't want to dump all this trauma on them but I don't know how else to explain myself in a way that would make sense. Either way, they would be scared off. In this case, I did not over explain and we left things on good (but heartbreaking) terms.

This emotional frozenness has been a problem throughout my life. I could give gifts and grand gestures and pour my heart out beautifully in writing (all of it would be true), but I could NOT bring myself to unfreeze when in front of the person I love or care about. I grew up in a family that never said ""I love you"", never said kind things, and never expressed physical affection. Again, explaining any of this would scare the average person far far away.

Can anyone else relate? I know this is all due to trauma but I'm just so tired of being trapped in my own mind and body this way. I am losing people I love or want to love because I can't get out of my own way.",5,1757360474.0,cptsd_bipoc,0,1.0,False

After two hours of being locked in, one of my other group members was uploading our data to Excel and we were basically done and waiting for that. May I remind you the rest three of us were just standing there, and then my friend comes up to me and we chat for a bit. Out of the three of us, she decides to SCREAM at me in front of my group members for being ""disrespectful"" and not helping my group when theres nothing I can do to speed up the data uploading process theres only one computer girly pops. The other two men were also just doing nothing but talking to each other at this stage because THERE IS NOTHING TO DO BUT WAIT FOR LIKE FIFTEEN MORE SECONDS. Yet she singles me out and screams at me in front of the whole lab. I left that lab crying because I do not deal with being yelled at well unfortunately.

 I heard from my female friends she also replies passive aggressive email responses conveniently only to female students, so this is becoming a pattern rather than a coincidence. I really just want to stub this in the bud rather than deal with this shit all semester, but what even is there to do when professors hold as much power as they do.

I got engaged seven months ago and have set a wedding date for spring 2026. I already asked all of my bridesmaids to be in the wedding a few months back, and one approached me this past weekend asking to get coffee. When we were at coffee, she went on for two hours about how my fianc√© and I are too immature and got engaged way too fast. I do not usually condone getting engaged in under a year, but my fianc√© and I allowed our relationship to progress at its own pace, and it made sense for us as we have already planted our roots and spent a lot of time seeking wise counsel (we are strong Christians if you can't tell). Essentially, she said I had become pressured by the church and my fianc√© to become engaged/ get married, and did not believe that I actually needed to get married. Although prior to her and her ex's breakup, she had intended to get engaged in a couple of months (over half the time of my dating stage) because she said, ""God said"" he was her future husband, I don't want to pin it on jealousy because I don't fully get that vibe.  She mentioned that she believes I am still in my honeymoon phase and have rose colored glasses to everything at the moment, contributing to my ""immaturity"". Then, when speaking about the house my fiance and I had planned on buying, she mentioned that I was being vain and she would never ""keep up with the Joneses"" like I supposedly am trying to. But truth be told, I never mentioned wanting to live in a big fancy neighborhood; I said I wanted farmland and a house my fianc√© and I can personalize to our needs/ desires through DIY projects.  
I spoke to my best friend/ MOH about this, asking what she would do in my shoes. She stated that she would still invite her to the wedding, but would ask her to step down from being a bridesmaid. I genuinely have no idea what to do or think, and I left both conversations as confused as before. My MOH has done a great job of walking me through this, but I would like to know if anyone else has had a similar situation and what they did.

EDIT: getting a lot of questions regarding age and how quickly I am ""rushing"", I am 25 and he is 26. I specifically put our wedding over a year after getting engaged, so we would have more time to prep for marriage and prioritize premarital counseling (weve been doing it with our pastor and a few couples we would like to model our relationship after) 

Also, yes farmland is expensive lol, we dont want a massive lot and are looking at fixer upper homes if that helps... bridesmaid and I live in a fairly weathy area so it would be significantly cheaper to do that than find a move in ready home. ",2,1757360059.0,wedding,32,0.63,False

I'm a 22-year-old guy from Croatia. I'm 6'3"" (190 cm), with a bigger build, but very disciplined and actively working on it.

I recently finished my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering and while I'm preparing for my master's, I find myself thinking a lot about the future. Alongside my personal goals, I've realized it would be great to meet the right partner to build a future with and sharing all of life's ups and downs, as well as the small, beautiful moments in between.

I'm an introvert by nature, which just means I'm not the loudest person in the room. On the contrary, I deeply value my people and the quality time spent with them. I'm a calm and analytical guy, and I consider honesty and loyalty the foundation of any real relationship. It's incredibly important to me to create a bond where we can tell each other absolutely anything without fear of judgment. That's why, instead of loud parties and small talk, I much prefer deep conversations and that comfortable silence for two, when words aren't even necessary. My love for animals fits perfectly into this picture and although I don't have a pet of my own, I've dreamed of having a husky since I was a kid, so if you're an animal lover too or have a pet such as a cat or a dog, that's a huge plus haha. As for my lifestyle, I don't do drugs, I don't smoke, I only drink socially, and while I do believe in God, I'm not some religion fanatic.

My interests are pretty diverse, ranging from technology to philosophy. Gaming has always been a part of my life, though lately, it's been making way for new interests. Still, when I get the urge, I love epic stories like¬†Red Dead Redemption 2¬†(the GOAT, in my opinion, haha), but I also enjoy the online action of CS, Battlefield, and PUBG. In my free time, I often dive into podcasts about psychology, existentialism, and absurdism, all seasoned with a healthy dose of dark humor. When I want to get away from the screen, I enjoy long walks, a good movie at the cinema, or just a relaxed drink and a meal with friends. Out of everything, though, TV shows are my special passion. If you've also spent sleepless nights binging¬†Game of Thrones,¬†Breaking Bad, or¬†Mindhunter, we'll definitely have something to talk about.

As for what I'm looking for, I'm not interested in flings as I'm tired of superficial connections and games. I want to meet an open and honest girl for something real, beautiful, and long-term. It‚Äôs really important to me that we share similar life values, as I'd love to have a family one day. Ideally, you'd be around my age, up to 27, mainly because I'm looking for someone in a similar life stage at that turning point after university, and starting to build a life on your own terms.

And if a romantic connection doesn't happen, I'm always open to new friendships. After all, it's great to have someone you can talk to honestly and realistically about anything, grab a coffee/lunch with occasionally,¬†or just hop on for a game.

If you find yourself in any of this, I'd love to hear from you. To start, tell me what's the last TV show you watched that truly blew you away? :)",1,1757359273.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False

\-Activities/Lifestyle: Church & Bible studies,  Walking (including w/my dog),  Pool access (beach not necessary),  Dog-friendly,  Playing piano,  Biking,  Tennis & Golf,  Baseball games (MiLB is fine),  Volunteer opp's,  Farmer's markets,  Botanical gardens,  Art fairs,  Jazz concerts,  Plays & Theatre,  Museums,  Traveling around the US.   Open to boating, hiking, fishing, getting back into playing cards.   Not into skiing or scuba diving.   Grew up with horses so enjoy volunteering at/watching horse shows.

\-Not a drinker (I'll drink wine on occasion but not really into it -- more of a coffee girl).  Don't care if others drink, but am I going to be the oddball if I'm not drinking?

  
**Cities narrowed down to:**

\-Dallas, TX.   Seems to be the winner, lots of young professionals with possibly a lot of the same interests.  Friendly people I've heard.  Could build a life & a future there in career, community & family.  Weather actually doesn't seem to be much of a concern for me coming from Indiana - winter only seems to be 2-3 months, not usually below 40¬∞F & rarely snow? Summers in the 90's (experienced that in FL already, will take it over Indiana winters - endless grey days & below 40¬∞F for 5 months + sometimes a month of snow)?

\-Charlotte, NC.   Weather is definitely the best, can take weekend beach trips, and the Myers Park area has always seemed nice. Concerned though that it's mostly families or college kids, and lacking much community for young professionals (also seems like the culture may solely be focused on getting married & having kids before they're 30, like here in Indiana--don't want to be the only one without kids yet?). Also, the dating scene may be crazy (a lot of two-timing?).

\-FL (Miami, Orlando, Tampa).   I don't think FL offers what I need, but included it here in case someone has a different opinion.  Jacksonville, West Palm Beach & Fort Lauderdale seem too dicey, and the rest of Florida doesn't seem to have enough for young professionals (low wages, not a lot of job opp's, high & unpredictable home/car insurance, not a lot of activities outside of beach/shopping/drinking/country club memberships).  It still seems to mostly be either retirees, families, or college kids, and lacking community for my demographic (single, young but established professional - not right out of college, and has interests outside of work).



\-Side note on other areas: Nashville, TN and Austin, TX didn't seem to have enough for young professionals (and Nashville gets every type of bad weather in the book), Houston seemed a little too raw/edgy (and lots of flooding issues). Raleigh & Asheville, NC seemed too rural. Arizona (Phoenix, Scottsdale) also didn't seem to have enough for young professionals and consistently saw comments (by native Arizonans) that people aren't that friendly there.",3,1757359063.0,SameGrassButGreener,10,1.0,False

My partner and I are planning a trip to Hawaii from September 30th to October 9th and would love some feedback on our itinerary. We love hiking, including difficult trails, and are open to any suggestions. We're also having a hard time deciding between staying in Kona or Waikoloa on the Big Island.

**Kauai**

* **Day 1:** Land in Kauai at 11:30 AM, pick up our rental car, and drive north to Princeville. We‚Äôll drop off our luggage at our hotel, then spend the afternoon relaxing, snorkeling, and exploring some nearby beaches.
* **Day 2:** Take the 6:20 AM shuttle from Waipa Park and Ride to Haena State Park. We plan to hike to the waterfall, then relax at Ke'e Beach before heading back. We'll be staying in Princeville again.
* **Day 3:** Na Pali Coast boat tour. We're not sure which tour to choose or if we should start from the North or South side of the island. We'll be staying in Lihue tonight.
* **Day 4:** Explore Waimea Canyon and Koke ªe State Park. We plan to hike the Nu'alolo Trail and then catch the sunset at Poipu Beach. Staying in Lihue.
* **Day 5:** We're considering kayaking on the Wailua River in the morning. Our flight to Hilo is at 7:00 PM, landing at 9:45 PM. After picking up our rental car, we'll head to our hotel in Hilo.

**Big Island**

* **Day 6:** Visit Volcanoes National Park (VNP) and then return to Hilo.
* **Day 7:** Drive to Kona, stopping at Punalu'u Black Sand Beach. We're also thinking about renting kayaks to see Captain Cook. An alternative would be to explore North Hilo instead. We‚Äôll be staying in either Kona or Waikoloa Village.
* **Day 8:** Hike the Polol≈´ Valley Trail in the morning and relax at Hapuna Beach. In the evening, we have a manta ray snorkeling tour planned. Staying in Kona or Waikoloa Village.
* **Day 9:** Rest day, with the option of visiting the Mauna Kea Visitor Information Station or hiking to the summit. We're a bit concerned about renting a Jeep from a local company due to insurance issues. Staying in Kona or Waikoloa Village.
* **Day 10:** Another rest day, or maybe a coffee tour before our 7:40 PM flight to NYC.

We are aware that the Ironman championship is taking place, we have hotel bookings for both Kona and Waikoloa (We should cancel one).

1nbwzqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramas/comments/1nbwzqb/watching_coffee_prince_for_the_first_time_long/,Watching Coffee Prince for the first time // Long Rant,"I felt like posting about how I'm enjoying the series and how unexpectedly cool it is, but what made me rush was the loads of bashing on other posts & comments about the FL and how she's annoying, how the actress makes it a caricature, bad gender swap acting bla bla bla. You guys need to chill a bit. It's fiction. It's supposed to be a comedy. It's 2007..? And it's still very much ahead of its time for a kdrama. 

Someone said she doesn't act like a boy. Well, why should she? She is NOT a boy. She's not supposed to be an A grade actress pretending to be a boy. This is not a soul swap case like Mr. Queen (shout out to the mind-blowing performance of the FL in that one!). The ML just assumes she's a dude and she goes with it. She's not trying to ‚Äúact‚Äù any different around him with voice change or mannerisms or anything cause he already thinks of her og self (the way she is) as a guy. A pretty guy. A fem guy even. Idk. So this point about her ‚Äúbad acting‚Äù is moot. And the case of her being ‚Äúannoying?‚Äù please, you shouldn't be out here in the kdrama world if you're bothered by annoying FLs, c'mon now. I haven't watched much, but I can assure you will find much worse.

On the topic of worst, have you guys watched this drama called ‚Äúcome back, mister?‚Äù (if not, don't bother, stay away, you're welcome). //Sorry I went on this offtopic rant ahead, you can just skip past this whole para// A few seconds of the soul/gender swap acting of that actress and you might feel like giving a standing ovation to the performance in coffee prince. Now that was a classic gender/soul swap case, so theres absolutely no excuse for the dimwit acting. The difference between the chef guy when played by the male actor and the over-the-top caricature of the female actor is just unforgivable. Did the mellow chef had a total personality makeover after he gets the hot female body? I don't think so. Now that's an example of bad acting. And direction. Bad everything really. But again, if she had given a nuanced performance (like mr. queen) there'd be nothing in that series worth watching. The chef's character as shown in flashbacks is boring af. Her out of place weird mannerisms is the only thing keeping the comedy alive in that one. The rest of it is a nonsense snoozefest. And I've watched only a couple of episodes. I could've just watched the 2 comedy scenes on YouTube and saved my precious time. Ugh, time wasted.

Whatever! The point is: Coffee Prince doesn't deserve the unnecessary bashing it gets. They're not even making the ‚Äúam I attracted to a guy?‚Äù thing all ‚ÄúEW, GROSS, Why Am I Like This?‚Äù the way they did in He's Beautiful. Unexpected. Commendable. So, leave it the heck alone.

I'm not watching this for the plot. I'm watching for the interactions, the visuals, the comedy. Everything is so chill, fun, cute, cool. Like a summer afternoon. That said, I'm very curious about the hot Japanese guy's plot and where that's going. So far I only know he's in the country to look for his girl/crush/ex. They haven't specified yet.

It's too non-boring for a show from the 20s. I say this because I couldn't stand the secret garden and the force with which I was let down and my patience was tested still boils my blood. I could make a spite post on that. And that one clip I happened to watch of F4 made me cringe so hard I felt the pain in my braincells. I'm of the belief that old dramas are amazing at taking a super interesting plot that could've been a riot and making it super underwhelming and drag.

So, although I found the plot of coffee Prince interesting, I had low expectations to begin with. But I was wrong. This is not one of those boring dramas of lost opportunities. The only thing (two) I can't stand in coffee prince is whatever's the nonsense going on with the second leads and the nonsense they're up to with our main leads respectively. What in the‚Ä¶I don't want to know. I don't care. Those two don't exist for me (I've been fast forwarding /skipping every time since their first scene together). But seriously, what is that ajusshi dude up to? And why is his gf like that? Don't tell me. Idgaff. It gets on my nerves more cause I'm aware that actual people like these two exist in this world. They baffle me but they exist. So, in that sense, we can't call this a flaw. The fact that it's managed to annoy me so much just gives them more points.

P.S. I think I get the Gong Yoo hype now. It's so worth it. 

P.P.S. how swoon-worthy is the Japanese dude‚Ä¶just wow.

I‚Äôve attached a drawing of the layout (living room + kitchen + dining area).

**Room & gear details:**

* Large open space, TV wall is opposite sectional
* 86"" LG TV mounted with an 80"" media console underneath
* Sectional sofa + swivel chair + coffee table + end table
* I can fit a soundbar + subwoofer(s), but I can‚Äôt do rear speakers
* Sources: Apple TV + Nintendo Switch
* Usage: Mostly shows / YouTube / movies, occasional gaming and music

**What I‚Äôm considering:**

* **Sonos Arc Ultra + Sub**
* **Sennheiser AMBEO Max**

I‚Äôve read a lot of mixed reviews about both. The AMBEO gets praise for immersion but also complaints about being boomy and overpriced. Sonos seems user-friendly and integrates well, but I‚Äôve also seen a ton of complaints about the SONOS app recently, which makes me hesitant to commit.

**Main question:**  
Given my layout and the fact I can‚Äôt add rear speakers, what would you recommend? Stick with a high-end single bar like the AMBEO Max, go Sonos Arc with a Sub, or is there another option I should be considering for a large open room?

1nbwwp5,https://i.redd.it/nwxekbcxpznf1.jpeg,What we need to know about measuring HRV,"This is a quick overview of what we think about HRV data usage and interpretation. To get any meaningful insights from heart rate variability measurements, we need to do the following: collect accurate and meaningful data, and then interpret it objectively. And each step is trickier than it sounds.

Collecting accurate data.
Technology is getting surprisingly good at this. To measure HRV, we need to detect the precise timing between heartbeats, what‚Äôs called RR intervals. For years, this required an ECG or a chest strap. But now, Apple Watch can capture HRV readings that are virtually indistinguishable from those reference systems. That‚Äôs really a big deal for people who don‚Äôt want to spend a lot of time on self quantifying stuff.

Collecting meaningful data.
Here‚Äôs where most people slip up. Accuracy isn‚Äôt enough if you‚Äôre measuring at the wrong time. HRV is extremely sensitive to context i.e. when you measure matters. Researchers have long agreed that the most reliable approach is to measure first thing in the morning: right after getting up, before food, coffee, or exercise. That gives us a consistent baseline. The good news? With an Apple Watch, we can do this easily: just run a one-minute breathing session in the Mindfulness app before you even get out of bed.

Interpreting the data.
And this is the hardest part. HRV jumps around a lot. One day it‚Äôs higher, the next day lower. Not every dip is a disaster, and not every bump is a breakthrough. What matters isn‚Äôt the noise from day to day, but whether the values consistently move outside of normal range. That‚Äôs when something significant might be happening: stress, illness, or recovery.

Think of HRV like body‚Äôs readiness score. If the  baseline is normal, that‚Äôs the green light for intense training, challenging work, or stress you choose. If it‚Äôs suppressed, that might be a signal to back off, rest more and recover.

The real magic of HRV is timing. By giving our body the right stimulus whether that‚Äôs hard training, deep rest, or just making smarter decisions at the right time, we can adapt better, perform better, and avoid burnout. It‚Äôs not about doing more; it‚Äôs about doing things when our body is ready.

And that‚Äôs why HRV is powerful: it lets us sync our behavior with our biology.

So, about 3:00 am, we drive over to his mother's house. We get out and he's opening his mother's door with the four of us standing around him.  All of a sudden a car pulls up and three guys jump out calling, ""Hey John! Johnny! You okay?! What's going on? You need help?!""

It's my first time writing anything whatsoever on reddit or using it in general but recently I experienced something that I wanted to share. 

Yeah im not very expressive nor perceptive to myself but after the incident I felt that I should know how it's for everyone first time.

Okay so im a dropper this year -NEET prep fucked up this year even after consistent good performance- and I recently joined my previous coaching centre nearby. Im in a repeater batch as the general batch works specifically for ""good"" students that are assured to get it right next year meaning everyone here is very good in their prep. 

There's almost 50:50 girls to boys ratio in the class and I have my usuall buddies to sit and talk with everyday but last Saturday(a extra class day from 9AM to 3PM) something happened which was NEW to me. But the thing started a day before-

So already sleepy in the morning, my buddies and me decided to get a coffee before class. We were coming back to our class when we crossed 3-4 girls of my class and one of them quite literally jumped upon me almost making me slip requesting or rather demanding me the coffee that I had in my hand. Damn i didn't knew how to react... She was clutching my hand and didn't let go even when I told her that I had already taken a sip. She was ready to have it. Let's call her Y. Seeing this, obviously, in the middle of staircase surrounded by my friends and other girls, I was shocked, a little embarrassed and awkward as hell. Not knowing what to do, i just simply refused and ran to my class with my snickering friends behind me. After a day of inquisitive eyes and taunts of my friends the next day-

Y is a girl my age -she is pretty no doubt, she has scored more than me in the last 2 tests(her rank 3 and me rank 5 among 300) and is THE popular girl in the class- and so obviously word spread. Nobody says anything but you know. 

So now on Saturday we forgot everything and we are having our first class and just after that we had a 15min break. Y appers. Right there in the class among all the ppl- 3 girls in the front 2 boys and a girl at the back and my 2 friends- she appears with the sweetest of smile and again DEMANDS that it's my duty and it's her REQUEST for a coffee not FROM mebut WITH me. Im was sitting there just dumbfounded. Everyone in my row was looking at me and it was AWKWARD AS FUCK. I have never been asked out by a girl for a coffee ever before. I was not able to generate a response. I don't even remember what I blabbered... I blushed... My ears turned red and I had no response but to show my ""sigma"" character to my friends, i somehow refused her. Then and there i refused her. I said thanku but im not going and she's like okayy umm I'll come back. She didn't let it go because I wanted but because break was over.

The second class went out in a daze. My brain was not functioning. I was warm all over and just as i was trying the peice out everything the second break started after the second class...

She was back. Y was back beside me in her usual sweet smile and again I was blank. This time however she whispered something first- ""i WANT to have a coffee with you... You'll have to"" and then in her usual tone she grabbed my hand and pulled me hard towards the exit. This time everyone was watching us and everyone was quite. I don't know if I felt a zap when she held my hands but the best course of action to avoid any gossips after was to cordially decline the invitation. She was more adamant this time and told me that it was her treat this time but my brain was too surprised to fall for it.

I just remember- ""Ahh Y thanku but im not going... Not today and not anytime soon... You can have it... Want a treat? Ill give you one but not like this"" and I remain seated.

She stopped. She blinked. She Let go of my hand and and went back to her seat with a silent promise- she will be back.

I was mercilessly taunted by my friends and I know I will be forever but that day will be forever etched.

Umm is it fine if she did that? Was I too cold? Was she too upfront? Did I miss something? What do you guys think...",2,1757358199.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

We met at work and started off physical before we got official. Ive been with him since Jan this year and its been amazing. 

One of my gal friends, I'll call her C, has been a bit weird towards both my bf and me, me a bit longer though. (Ill go in chronological order). 

I was essentially adopted into the friend group but im not one of the OGs, the rest all went to college together when I went to a different one. They were all going on holiday, 7 in total, with 3 couples and one extra dude J. C and her ex broke up shortly before the holiday and I was invited to take his space. 

Between this time, C and J got in a situationship so messy. They used to be in a relationship a while ago but they were just fwb then. C and J were making very obvious hints they wanted to sleep with me as a threeway. I should have just said no from the get go but I didnt want to be mean. So I just kind of joked about it - i realise this was my first mistake and im a bit more honest with her now. I ended up rooming with those two in the hotel and they effed with me in the room when we went to bed and another time in the bathroom when I was there. They didnt have an ounce of guilt and just kind of laughed it off. 

Eventually C and J stopped seeing each other physically but theyre both in the same friend group, not sure how they do that but thats their issue not mine. Cut to a night out a whole later, im drunk asf and theyre both kissing me. I dont mind so much in retrospect bc we were all a bit tipsy but in the grand scheme of things it seemed relevant to add. 

C starts seeing another guy unofficially and he tells C to tell me that he thinks im fit and that I should go hang out with them. I declined that night bc I was tired. Eventually she leaves this dude and finds her current BF ill refer to as A. Hes quite promiscuous as well so they seemed perfect for each other, and that perhaps they would leave me alone. One day me and C go out for coffee and she just casually drops the bomb that A had a wet dream about me. I was shocked that that happened and that she even told me! I cant look at A the same way without feeling uncomfortable.

Another recent thing C has done is told me she got my BF something for his upcoming birthday. Bearing in mind id only mentioned the date once and a drink he likes once. She also asked me to give her my BFs number without explanation, I asked and he said fine though he was unsure about it. It was for a group chat but she could've said that bit first? She's also just requested to be friends with my BF on Snapchat. 

Am I being paranoid? I don't want to confront her bc I was accepted into her friend group not the other way around. But I also don't want her or A to bother us anymore. BF said we can wait to see if she will do anything else as we both have her and A on our radar. I'm not a confrontational person, even just typing this is giving me mad anxiety.

1.  Not attending meetings to spend time helping friends, family and neighbors with their needs.

2. Exercising indoors and outdoors by walking and cycling to loose the pounds I accumulated sitting in church meetings.

3. Volunteer to give blood, clean up the parks and donate food to the food banks.

4. Not pay tithing but instead giving the money to family and friends who are in need.

5.  Have coffee with an old friend who has been lonely.

I know I am easy to manipulate, especially because of how much guilt I feel and how intense my emotions can get, and I need help leaving. I at least need people to give me third party opinions and a wake up call on how much I have let the abuse continue. How can I manage to leave without being guilted into staying? I know that I have massively enabled this. I just need someone to shake some sense into me. (Also, hedging the AI accusations: I write for fun, I use em dashes all the time. Please don't assume this is AI just because I enjoy syntax and punctuation). 

I have not told all of this to anyone ever because it is embarrassing. I know that the situation I'm in is my fault because I have no spine. 

I met my boyfriend, who we'll call Vic, six years ago at work. At the time, I had just graduated from college and moved back home with no professional goals whatsoever, and I had started deconstructing from some extremely stringent evangelicalism and conservativism. I was not in a good head space at all, and it felt like the whole world was crashing down around me at the time. I was feeling rebellious for the first time in my life when I met Vic--tall, with a checkered past and a two year old daughter-- and even though we frequently got on each other's nerves at work, I thought he was attractive. He seemed to think I was attractive. I was dumb enough to think that I could handle something casual. 

We started hooking up in late 2019, which was the first serious issue, and which I now can admit was assault. I lost my virginity to him. We were fooling around, and he bent me over and said it was just the tip. I kept telling him to be careful because I wasn't ready to lose my virginity yet. He kept telling me it was ok, it was just the tip, but then when the lights came on, there was blood everywhere. I just absorbed it in my mind, I guess. I was just happy to be spending so much time with him, and he seemed happy to be around me, so I told myself that it had just kind of happened--though I did invite him over two weeks later to 'actually' lose my virginity at my parents house. 

We got a lot closer until the COVID shutdown. I was living in a mobile home at the time (a really nice one, actually, nicer than any apartment I've ever had), and he was living with his very abusive parents. So when everything closed, I invited him to stay with me, and he has been living with me ever since then. Sleeping in my bed, having sex regularly, planning life together. I was involved in his daughter's life as well, at a minimum level at that point. 

Fast forward, and he ends up moving with me to live with a mutual friend of ours--again, in the same bed, his stuff was in my closet, etc. Every once in awhile, he'd make a comment so I knew that we weren't technically together, because he 'wasn't a relationship guy.' I had gained actual feelings, and he treated me like he had feelings, so I just agreed and stayed quiet. In April of 2021, his daughter's mom texted me saying that she was assuming I was Vic's girlfriend, and let me know they had been sleeping together. Vic and I got into a massive fight and he left for a week. But because 'technically' we weren't in a relationship, I decided I had no right to be mad at him, and begged him to come back, which he did. 

A few weeks later, he told me he loved me. Within a two week span, he told me he was in love with me three times. Then he started disappearing at night. I found out that he had met a girl (who we'll call Thalia) in a town about an hour away, and he was falling over himself for her basically. I felt super betrayed but couldn't figure out why. I felt I had no right to hold him accountable for anything, so when he said he wanted to continue to date Thalia, I told him that was fine but that he needed to leave somewhere else. That's when he jumped in and said 'If me dating her is going to ruin our friendship, though, then I won't date her.' Which looking back, was extremely unfair of him to say, but I felt like I was stuck. I couldn't decide what the 'right thing' to do was, and because I had just lost my religion and my sense of morality, my head was super messed up. 

He left, and I ended up having to move in with my parents because I couldn't afford rent alone. I found out later that he moved in with Thalia when he left, which I didn't know about. I actually didn't know they had 'officially' gotten together until much much later. The night he moved in with her, I was prepared to cut him off completely (because I knew they were at least seeing each other and it was too much pain for me--I spent the summer sobbing to him and asking him what he expected me to do, and he 'talked me through it' the entire time and tried to 'help guide me' to a healthy decision). The next morning, he sent me a text from a hospital bed. He had quite literally left me, gone to her, and his lungs had collapsed. He was in the hospital for three months. 

I didn't feel like I could cut him off anymore, because he'd nearly died. I couldn't see him in the hospital because of COVID restrictions, but I would drop him off some like coffee, and I cooked him food etc. He would tell me about how helpful his parents were being. When he left the hospital, he spun a whole story about how his mom put a bed in the living room for him so he didn't have to climb the stairs, how his family was suddenly so helpful, etc etc etc. One night in December, he texted me to come over to his apartment because he was drunk and no one was awake. That's how I found out he'd moved in with Thalia. I rejected him, but only softly. Thalia (evidently) went through his texts and saw him texting me to come over, and broke up with him. (I used to be so violently jealous of her, and now I'm jealous of her for getting away so quickly lol). 

Three months later, Vic and I met up again and he seemed like he'd changed. It broke my heart knowing how fixated he had been on Thalia when I had been right there, but he was also verbalizing a lot of things I had thought previously, and it seemed like he had become so reflective and understanding of his own behavior. We were in an official relationship in March. It was good for about three months. 

I was supporting both of us on my one paycheck because he was in school, and ended up defaulting on my loans and crashing my credit. Little stressors would make him crash out completely. He didn't talk to me for three days once because he thought I made fun of him, when the person I was really making fun of was his mom, and once he understood the joke, he thought it was hilarious. But yeah, didn't talk to me, and locked me out of our bedroom. This was a cycle for awhile. During this cycle, he also convinced me to try out a kink of his. I tried it, and would tell him I had fun (because I'll try almost anything once, I see it as an adventure even if it ends up not being my thing) but that I wasn't super into it. He didn't believe me. He thought I was sparing his feelings, and would push and push and push until I 'admitted' that it was the best thing I'd ever experienced, which he would then use to leverage me into doing it again.

Eventually, this spiraled into our biggest and longest fight: he was convinced I wasn't attracted to him, didn't love him, and was only with him because I wanted a companion. He broke up with me multiple times during this period and I would sob for days until he took me back, only for things to spiral again. He'd be so happy and so in love with me one day, and the next day he'd stop talking to me. We liked being a little rough sometimes in bed, but he was taking it outside of bed too. He'd never hit me in anger, but he was always just lightly slapping me in the face for no reason and then grabbing me and kissing me really roughly. Like biting me too. And if I complained, he'd throw his hands up in the air and tell me I was boring. 

I finally had enough in April. A couple of days after my birthday, he went out of town to a game with his friends and came back very sullen and moody. One morning he complained about how I wasn't very initiative toward him, and proceeded to say it was unfixable. I asked if it was so unfixable, why was he still with me, he said for convenience. I broke up with him. Later, he said that he'd just said that as a 'wake up call' for me. He ended up sobbing and begging me to stay, saying that his daughter was so attached to me and it would break her heart. I stayed (also because he owned my car at the time). 

I tried to leave again in June, my transmission went out and I suddenly had no car. I tried to leave again in August and was HALF WAY OUT. I had moved halfway to my parents, was planning on getting the rest of my stuff the next day after work. I walked into work that day and promptly got fired. When I told Vic, he became a hero all of a sudden and promised to take care of me so I could focus on school and my stepdaughter. 

And that's where I'm having the most trouble. I love my stepdaughter. I adore her. And even as recently as this weekend, she's opened up to me about how unsafe she feels with her stepdad because of his anger issues (he's very violent--he has never touched the kids, but he's hit their mom multiple times, poured bleach on her clothes etc). Vic has been very close to me, his behavior has gotten much better, but I'm at the end of my rope. I got pushed too far. But this is my stepdaughter's only real safe space, and because of Vic's job, if I leave, she gets stuck back at her mom's for the majority of the time. Right now, we're sharing a car as well, so I need to pick a day where he drives himself to work and back as opposed to me dropping him off, but I'm mostly the one who picks my stepdaughter up and stuff like that as well. 

I don't know what to do or how to do this. This is scratching the surface of everything that's happened between us, and I'm purposefully forcing myself to write down the parts I've been hiding/am ashamed about because logically I know staying with this man is insane. But I'm having such a hard time leaving. I need advice on how to do it, what to say. Encouragement. Anything helps. The problem is things have been going so well between us this summer, so it feels weird to just up and leave (though I do have evidence he's been cheating for a couple years, so that's my ticket). I just irrationally feel like I'm about to ruin everything and destroy everyone's lives. I'm worried he'll hurt himself. He said the other day he doesn't know if he can handle one more thing going wrong in life, and I just stood there. I am begging for advice on what to do and how to get myself out.

I sold my wedding ring to buy a plane ticket the day I found out my ex bought a $2 million house with his new wife.

I know how that sounds. Trust me, I know. But I need someone to tell me if I'm being crazy here because my family won't stop calling me delusional.

Three years ago, I left my husband while he was killing himself working two jobs. Construction during the day, Uber at night. We lived in this crappy one-bedroom apartment where the ceiling leaked and the heat barely worked. Every month was the same fight about money. I'd come home from my part-time retail job and find him passed out on the couch, still in his work boots, sawdust in his hair.

""We can't keep living like this,"" I told him one night after our power got shut off again. ""I'm 28 years old and washing dishes in the bathtub because we can't afford to fix the kitchen sink.""

He just looked at me with those tired eyes and said, ""I'm trying, baby. I'm doing everything I can.""

But I was done trying. I was done with ramen noodles and thrift store clothes and watching my friends post vacation photos while I counted pennies for gas money.

That's when I met Mark at my cousin's engagement party. He pulled up in a Tesla, wearing a suit that probably cost more than our rent. We talked all night. He owned three restaurants, had a condo downtown, traveled to Europe twice a year. When he texted me the next day, I knew I shouldn't respond.

I responded anyway.

The affair lasted two months before I finally packed my stuff while my husband was at his night job. Left a note on the kitchen counter. ""I can't do this anymore. I need more from life. I'm sorry.""

Mark let me move into his condo immediately. Marble countertops, floor-to-ceiling windows, a closet bigger than my old apartment. He bought me designer clothes, took me to restaurants where appetizers cost $50. Posted pictures of us on Instagram with captions about ""upgrading your life."" My ex never even had social media.

My family lost their minds. My mom called me crying. ""That man loved you. He was working himself to death for you.""

""Love doesn't pay bills,"" I told her.

My dad was worse. ""You're a selfish brat who threw away a good man for money.""

I blocked most of them. Started fresh. New life, new me, right?

For three weeks, everything was perfect. Then I came home early from a spa day Mark had paid for and found him in our bed with some 22-year-old hostess from one of his restaurants.

""Baby, it's not what it looks like,"" he actually said that. Like we were in some bad movie.

I stood there in my new Louboutins, holding a shopping bag from Nordstrom, feeling like the world's biggest idiot. The girl didn't even look embarrassed. She actually smirked at me while putting her clothes on.

""You really thought you were special?"" she said on her way out. ""He does this with all of us. The apartment, the clothes, the whole show. You're just this month's flavor.""

Mark didn't even deny it. Just shrugged and said, ""Come on, you knew what this was. You left your husband for me. What did you expect?""

I moved out that night. Ended up sleeping on my friend Sarah's couch. The same friend who had warned me about leaving my ex. The same friend who said, ""Mark seems too good to be true.""

My family wouldn't take my calls. I got a job waitressing, started rebuilding. It was humiliating. Customers who knew me from before would whisper when they saw me. ""Isn't that the girl who left her husband for that rich guy?""

For two years, I kept my head down. Worked doubles, saved money, tried to forget how badly I'd screwed up. Sometimes I'd drive past our old apartment and see my ex's truck in the parking lot. Part of me wanted to knock on the door, but I knew he'd never forgive me. I wouldn't forgive me.

Then last week, my sister finally started talking to me again. We met for coffee, and she was scrolling through her phone when her face went white.

""What?"" I asked.

She turned her phone around. There was my ex on Facebook. Standing in front of a massive house with a woman I'd never seen before. Both wearing wedding rings. The caption read: ""Can't believe this is really ours! From a studio apartment to our dream home. Never stop believing in better days.""

I zoomed in on the photo. The house was insane. Three stories, circular driveway, pool in the background. The woman was gorgeous. Natural, happy, the kind of pretty that doesn't need designer anything.

""That's his wife,"" my sister said quietly. ""They got married last year. She's a software engineer. They started some business together after you left. It took off.""

I spent the next three days stalking their profiles. Trips to Hawaii. A new truck. Pictures of them laughing at barbecues with all our old friends. The friends who had cut me off when I left him for Mark. Everyone looked so happy.

The worst part was a post from his mom. A woman who used to call me daughter. It was a photo from their wedding with the caption: ""So proud of my son for never giving up. He deserved someone who could see his worth even when times were hard.""

That felt aimed at me. Everything felt aimed at me.

I found out through mutual friends what happened. After I left, he threw himself into work even harder. Met his now-wife at a coding bootcamp he attended at night. She helped him land a tech job. They built some app together that got bought by a bigger company. Suddenly he went from barely making rent to making six figures.

""The universe rewards good people,"" my friend told me. ""He was always a good guy. You just couldn't see it.""

So yesterday I did something probably insane. I sold the wedding ring I'd kept in my jewelry box and bought a plane ticket to their city. I don't know what I'm planning to do. Show up at his door? Beg for forgiveness? Tell him I made the biggest mistake of my life?

I know how pathetic this sounds. I know I have no right to disrupt his happiness. But I can't stop thinking about how that could have been my house. My trips to Hawaii. My happy ending.

My flight leaves tomorrow. I keep typing and deleting messages to him on Facebook. ""Congratulations on everything."" Delete. ""I'm sorry for how things ended."" Delete. ""I was an idiot."" Delete.

The truth is, I was so focused on what I didn't have that I couldn't see what was right in front of me. A man who loved me. Who was building a future for us. Who would have given me everything if I had just been patient.

And I threw it all away for marble countertops and designer shoes.

So am I the asshole for wanting to reach out now? For selling my ring to buy this ticket? For even thinking I have the right to show up in his new perfect life?",2,1757358066.0,FoundandExpose,2,1.0,False

Google is a very powerful method that really works and gets the right person.  


You can create the best content in the world, but if nobody finds it, it won‚Äôt help your business. That‚Äôs where **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** comes in.

# What is SEO?

**SEO** is the process of making your content easy to find on Google. When someone searches ‚Äúbest coffee near me‚Äù and your caf√© shows up, that‚Äôs **SEO** working.

# Beginner Tips for SEO:

1. **Use keywords naturally** ‚Äì A keyword is the phrase people search for (like **SEO tips for beginners**). Add it to your title, first paragraph, and headings.
2. **Write clear titles** ‚Äì Google favors simple and descriptive titles like ‚ÄúHow to Bake Chocolate Cake.‚Äù
3. **Add links** ‚Äì Link to other blog posts on your site and trustworthy external sources.
4. **Optimize images** ‚Äì Use alt text (descriptions) for your images so Google can ‚Äúread‚Äù them.
5. **Be mobile-friendly** ‚Äì Make sure your website looks good on phones.

As mentioned I've been to Japan 4-5 times in the last decade so I'm not unfamiliar with the culture. This time I'm visiting Tokyo for about 4 days end of November and is semi-solo as I'm visiting a friend who is working there so I will only see her at night. I want to find interesting stuff I feel comfortable doing alone (general anxiety problems), and also visit neighborhoods I've never been. I'm staying in the Ueno, but in the past I would be in hotels in Shinjuku/Shibuya, so I mostly hung out in the western side of Tokyo. Please critique my itinerary and let me know if there's anything interesting you think I could add! 


Day 1: 12pm arrival, visit Ameyoko and Ueno Park area, go on a Sensoji night stroll.

Day 2: Nakameguro/Daikanyama daytime for the shops and coffee shops, go back to Asakusa area at night for the Ichi no Tori festival.

Day 3: Morning Ginza window shopping (Itoya, Tsutaya, Loft), Harajuku/Omotesando for just visiting and eating, quick Shibuya stroll, maybe bar hopping or going to a muscle girls bar for the first time. (worth the hype?) 

Day 4: Yanaka Ginza in the morning to visit the cat streets, Jinbocho for the cool bookstores, and then Ikebukuro to visit Sunshine City (not really an Anime fan but like to browse to see interesting stuff)

Bonus Questions:
 - the Odaiba hot spring theme park used to be one of my favorite things to do in Tokyo but it's sadly closed, is there anything similar now, ideally allow tattooed individuals. 

 - I've been to Shimokitazawa twice years ago and I'm not much of a secondhand clothing shopper, worth it to go back?

1nbwcrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stephapedia/comments/1nbwcrx/disney_msc_royal_oh_my/,"Disney, MSC & Royal - Oh my!!!","I've given some thought to how I wanted to go about introducing one to Pandora‚Äôs¬†box of cruising information¬†that lives rent-free in my head.

I've decided to focus on your destination first‚Äîthe Bahamas.¬† Did you know¬†that if you call the Bahamas tourism line, they say, ""Thank¬†you for calling the Bahamas?"" They do. I've sailed to the Bahamas and flown & stayed in the islands, which I have an obvious understanding of and a lot of experience with.¬†

I've attached a snippet of my Bahamas research post from February 2021.¬† My parents took me with them for a week (of their 3) as a congratulations for surviving brain surgery and because they'd never been and weren't going to Mexico because of the virus.¬†¬†

Anyway, here we go.

Overall, The Bahamas are kind of amazing, because they're beachy, beautiful & not Bermuda. Their weather is pretty consistent (when not in the path of an active hurricane).¬†The people are wonderful. Poverty is everywhere, but it is well tucked out of the tourist's eye. They¬†speak English, accept the American dollar, and are included in most major cellular plans.

Because of their geographic makeup of about 3k islands/cays/islets, of which only about 30ish are fully inhabited.¬† All of the islands are flat & low - which makes them largely easy to develop as private island oases for cruise lines & other corporations and even wicked rich people, though their islands tend to be in the USVI or BVI.

Nassau is the capital of the Bahamas, on New Paradise Island, connected by bridge to Paradise Island (think Atlantis).¬† Ships dock at Prince George Wharf right in downtown Nassau. Plenty of shopping & sites to see ‚Äì also a great stop to stay on the ship. More on that later.

Castaway Cay and Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point (on the island of Eleuthera) are owned by Disney Cruise Line.

CocoCay, fka Little Stirrup Cay, nka Perfect Day at CocoCay, is leased by Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (Royal & Celebrity lines).

Next to Little Stirrup is Great Stirrup Cay, owned by Norwegian Cruise Line.

Ocean Cay is leased by MSC Cruise Line and classified as a marine reserve due to the conservation efforts during the island's redevelopment.

Half Moon Cay (aka Little San Salvador Island) is owned by Carnival Corp.¬† They own a portion of Grand Bahama Island called Celebration Key.

More on the weather.

April and May, in my opinion, are the sweet spots. Mild temps, sun & warm water. Humidity can be higher as you get closer to June.¬† (June through November is the rainy/hurricane season.)¬† If you‚Äôre concerned with hurricanes, they tend to affect the northern portion of the archipelago and occur usually between July and October.

Temperatures are consistent throughout the year/seasons. Mid 70s to mid to high 80s. The warmest months are July through September, where the averages are in the 90s.

Port Canaveral vs. Port Everglades

Port Canaveral is the flagship home of Disney Cruise Line due to its close proximity to WDW and MCO airport. While it's the nearest port to Orlando International Airport (MCO), it's still about a 45-minute drive, so factor in travel time and potential traffic delays. Disney offers dedicated transfers from¬†Orlando International Airport¬†to the¬†Port Canaveral¬†terminal.

Port Everglades is the closest port to an airport; FLL is just 2 miles away and just about an hour north of MIA airport. With close access to downtown Ft Lauderdale and Miami by extension, a broader pre-cruise experience is available, offering more with a wider range of hotels, beaches, restaurants, and shopping.

Stateroom types/categories and that shit.

All three lines provide a range of stateroom options to suit different budgets and preferences. However, Disney and¬†Royal Caribbean¬†focus on family-friendly features. MSC leans towards a more international and often budget-conscious appeal.

Disney categorizes their staterooms into four main types: Inside, Oceanview, Verandah, and Concierge. Cabins are known for their family-friendly features, including split bathrooms (shower/tub and toilet in separate rooms) and convertible beds. The Concierge level is a premium offering that includes larger rooms or suites, a dedicated lounge with complimentary snacks and drinks, concierge service for onboard services and extras. Note: Some inside cabins on Disney Dream and Fantasy ships feature virtual portholes displaying real-time views and animated Disney characters.

Royal offers staterooms in four broad categories: Inside, Oceanview, Balcony, and Suites/Deluxe. Newer Royal ships feature a high number of balcony cabins. Like Disney, Royal offers ""virtual balconies"" in some inside cabins on select ships, featuring floor-to-ceiling LED screens that mimic balcony views. Additionally, Royal provides an infinite balcony option. ¬†Instead of a separate, step-out balcony, the infinite balcony integrates that space into the cabin itself, expanding the room's interior footprint. A large, floor-to-ceiling window can be lowered, either partially or fully. You can keep the window up and use the expanded space as part of your room or open it to enjoy the fresh air. For the ultimate in luxury, Royal offers the Royal Suite Class on Oasis, Quantum, Quantum Ultra, and Icon class ships. This program has three tiers ‚Äì Sea, Sky, and Star ‚Äì each offering increasing levels of benefits, including exclusive lounges, dining venues like Coastal Kitchen, and personalized services such as concierge or Royal Genie assistance.

MSC categorizes their cabins into six main types: Inside, Ocean View, Balcony, Deluxe Balcony, Suites, and MSC Yacht Club Suites. MSC offers different ""experience"" tiers (Bella, Fantastica, and Aurea) that determine cabin location, perks, and flexibility. Bella:¬†Entry-level with fewer perks. Fantastica:¬†Better locations and more flexibility. Aurea:¬†Includes spa access, drinks, and priority services.

The Yacht Club is a dedicated ""ship within a ship"" concept, offering a luxurious and exclusive experience with all-inclusive amenities, 24/7 butler and concierge services, private venues (lounge, restaurant, pool, sun deck), and premium beverages and Wi-Fi.

Lipids, thyroid, and metabolic panel in July all looked good save for higher-than-we'd like cholesterol.

In my teens + 20s I did every diet known to mankind. Was always ""dieting"" or ""off my diet,"" and didn't figure out sustainable fitness + nutrition til late 20s. Had my daughter \~6 years ago, lost most of the baby weight, and in the last 3 years it's crept back on. I'm hoping to avoid a rigid diet; I can spiral into obsessive/disordered eating territory easily.

I'm fairly active and eat pretty balanced, but in the last \~6 weeks I've been more intentional with my nutrition and activity. Here's what that's looked like:

* 10k steps/day, *minimum*. Average for YTD is over 10.5k and for the last 6 weeks over 11k. Brisk walks whenever I can, supplemented with a desk treadmill (I work from home) and whatever random bouts of movement I can get.
* Orange Theory workouts: 60m classes 2x/week, plus one treadmill only or strength only class each weekend, going on how my body feels. I sneak a 4th class whenever I can. I love how I feel after an OTF workout.
* each week averages 1850 calories a day, with at least 25g fiber and 120+g protein per day. This isn't perfect every single day (ie: 1700ish one day, 1900ish the next, etc. from time to time), but the weekly average is pitch perfect
* drinking 100+ oz water
* do the best I can on sleep, averaging 6-7ish hrs a night
* Lotta veggies, lotta legumes, fruit and whole grains in there, decent amount of chicken/turkey, and throw in fruit, seafood, etc. when it sounds good. I include mindful treats throughout the week. I try to not have anything be off limits and just work with what fits my calorie/protein/fiber goals, while being my mindful of my cholesterol. I don't eat or cook with a ton of pork or red meat by preference and mostly limit dairy to greek yog and whey shakes.
* One, maybe 2 restaurant meals per week - usually sushi, indian, or dominican. Everything else is cooked/baked at home. I overestimate restaurant calories and keep choices tasty and reasonable.
* I track *everything*, scout's honor. Every glug of cooking oil, splash of almond milk in coffee, couple bites of my daughter's unfinished oatmeal, weighed out portion of made-from-home, etc. I use a food scale for accuracy.

I¬†***feel***¬†**good**. Strength and cardio endurance both increasing (can lift a bit heavier, and I can work a lot harder on the treadmill, though I'm still a peppy sloth). Every few days I'm hungry enough to need another couple hundred cals, but account for it on lower hunger days through the week. I was¬†*ravenous*¬†at 1850 cal max¬†*per day*, but building in flexibility to go 50-200 cals up or down as hunger dictates has made an 1850 average way more sustainable.

My frustration is that my body composition is¬†**exactly the same**. My clothes feel a teensy bit more comfortable, but it's like a ""pms/bloating vs. not"" level of difference. I have a composition scale that hasn't changed a bit - overall weight, muscle, BF % (43.5%), lean mass, etc. all¬†*exactly the same*¬†as \~6 weeks ago. I know they're not perfectly accurate, but it's truly¬†*zero*¬†change. It's not the end all be all when I'm feeling good, but I can't help feeling frustrated that, as far as I know, I'm doing everything I should to create slow and sustainable changes, but not seeing any evidence of that outcome.

So, question to you who are smarter than I: am I sabotaging myself somewhere in here? Am I wildly overestimating my calorie needs for my activity level, missing something major in my nutrition, or screwing my TDEE math somewhere along the way? I am perfectly content with slow and steady - please don't think I'm pitching a fit because I haven't lost 10lbs in 6 weeks - I'm just baffled that there hasn't been any change to my composition. If it's a matter of ""stay the course and wait it out"" I will, but I want to interrogate my habits a little and make sure I'm not missing anything.

1nbw9j8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nbw9j8/reveal_the_best_coffee_maker_experience_with/,Reveal the Best Coffee Maker Experience with xBloom Studio Review,"A few months ago, I decided to elevate my coffee game and stumbled across the xBloom FW-02A-01. This sleek and stylish coffee maker promised to be the ultimate tool for crafting exceptional cups of coffee with a variety of options to play with. As someone who enjoys experimenting with flavors but also appreciates convenience, I couldn‚Äôt resist giving it a try. It certainly impressed me in more ways than one, although I had a few bumps along the way.

**Design That Stands Out**  
A minimalist yet modern design immediately caught my attention, and the matte Midnight Black finish added a premium touch to my kitchen counter. The small dimensions (8"" D x 6.7"" W x 14.75"" H) made this machine a great addition, without crowding the limited space I have. Its aesthetic effortlessly blended into my setup, but it wasn‚Äôt just about the looks; the layout of the buttons, tactile knobs, and the LED matrix are highly intuitive. This made it fun to navigate settings even on those early groggy mornings.

**Fully Automated Magic**  
This coffee maker brings automation to a whole new level. It offers three levels of automated brewing: Autopilot, Copilot, and Freesolo. Personally, Autopilot became my savior on busy weekday mornings. For tea-time weekends, I switched to the Copilot mode allowing me a bit more say in the process. Freesolo was where I unleashed my inner barista, brewing up experimental batches. You can either use the pods for quick, hassle-free results or whole beans when you're feeling adventurous. Speaking of xPods, I found them incredibly practical and eco-friendly since they're made from compostable materials. Plus, the all-purpose magnetic dosing cup and anti-static ionizer kept messes to a minimum.

**This Is the World of Customization**  
For coffee nerds like me, customization is key. With this machine, I was able to play DJ to my coffee using the xBloom app. Adjustments to recipes, saving my favorite settings, and even sharing my customized results felt like stepping into a futuristic coffee-pro world. Brewing strength could be altered depending on whether I needed a mellow Americano or a bold latte, allowing for incredible versatility. The programmable features added even more to the experience.

[Check xBloom FW-02A-01 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0dkkly1v9/)

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Offers three automated brewing modes for ultimate flexibility.  
- The integrated grinder lets you use pods or whole beans effortlessly.  
- Sleek design with user-friendly tactile controls and LED matrix.  
- The xBloom app amplifies control and convenience with recipe customization.  
- Includes thoughtfully curated accessories like the Omni Dripper 2 and magnetic dosing cup.  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- The initial setup of the xBloom app and Wi-Fi connection felt clunky.  
- The reliance on pods can feel limiting since xPods are proprietary.  
- Despite the machine being quieter than others, it's not whisper-quiet during grinding.  

**Where It Stands Among Competitors**  
Compared to other pour-over coffee makers like the Breville Precision Brewer, the level of innovation here is unparalleled. While the Breville model allows some temperature control and preset options, it doesn‚Äôt have the customization freedom or app integration that makes the xBloom stand out. As for pod machines like the Nespresso Vertuo, this machine‚Äôs ability to integrate whole bean grinding easily overshadows any convenience-focused pod maker. However, the xBloom could improve its ability to accommodate non-proprietary pods, which some rivals efficiently handle.

**Price Performance**  
I honestly feel the xBloom FW-02A-01 justifies its price tag with its multifunctionality and premium design. Although it‚Äôs not a budget-friendly option, its well-thought-out design and numerous features make it a compelling choice if you value both aesthetics and advanced coffee-making capabilities. If you're looking for a single machine that covers everything from quick morning fixes to weekend kitchen experiments, it delivers.

1nbw9i7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1nbw9i7/how_do_i_stop_caring_and_let_go_after_a_friend/,How do I stop caring and let go after a friend fallout,"One of my best friends and I had a falling out about two years ago. We‚Äôve been friends since we were 15, and now we‚Äôre both in our early 30s. It‚Äôs been a long friendship, and not the first time we‚Äôve had issues, but usually we resolved them. This time we didn‚Äôt. For some context: we grew up in the same city but went to college in different places. Even then we stayed close, writing letters and spending time together during breaks. After college, she moved back home and I stayed in my city. Later, she moved to a different town and I visited her there. In 2022 she moved to my city, and I helped her find an apartment. From the day she arrived, I was at her place helping her unpack. I introduced her to my friends, some of whom she already knew from past visits. That‚Äôs when a lot of our issues started.

We had never lived in the same city as adults before, and I think she was frustrated that I wasn‚Äôt always available. I was living with my now fianc√©, but I felt responsible for showing up whenever she wanted to hang out. She started spending time with my friends without me, which didn‚Äôt bother me, but sometimes I felt left out and jealous when they made memories together. Most of the time we all hung out as a group. At the same time, I felt like our personalities were drifting. We argued because I felt she was virtue signaling or being overly general in ways that felt polarizing.

There was one party where a friend of my fianc√©‚Äôs yelled at her for the above, which was not okay. I suggested we leave - I felt so bad and he did later apologize but she then held onto resentment that I had not argued with him on her behalf after he yelled, and instead suggested that we go home. When I was apartment-hunting in her neighborhood, she helped me, but later, in fights, said she felt used because she thought we weren‚Äôt as close anymore. I think both of us avoided sharing frustrations directly, which meant resentment built up.

The major falling out happened on her birthday trip abroad. Before the trip we had argued but seemed to be repairing things. I even got coffee with her to ask if she really wanted me there. She said yes and I apologized for my part in our earlier tiff. On the trip, though, things unraveled. She had planned poorly and was upset about how it was going. One night at karaoke, I sang first and then stepped outside for air. My two friends followed me, which upset her. She thought I was trying to make everyone leave. I explained I wasn‚Äôt, but she didn‚Äôt believe me. At the next bar she began ignoring me. I left early that night because I didn‚Äôt want to be blamed for something I hadn‚Äôt done. The rest of the trip was tense. She didn‚Äôt speak to me directly, only to others. I tried to keep the peace, but on the way home I learned she had been talking badly about me to her other friends, saying she only invited me so that my two friends would come. After the trip, we never spoke again. She did reach out to my two friends, but when she tried to bring me up, they changed the subject and wouldn‚Äôt engage.

The issue is that I‚Äôm getting married in a month. This whole year of wedding planning has me feeling extremely nostalgic, and given me a lot of perspective on the people in my life, my true friendships and those that don‚Äôt matter as much anymore. I‚Äôm torn by how awfully things ended with me and this friend. I‚Äôve had two years to think about all the reasons why she wanted to blame me for how badly the trip went, the trying to connect and talk badly about me to my other friends, the resentment, and I concluded everytime that we were frustrated with how our friendship was developing but I still have a lot of love for her. It makes me so sad to think she won‚Äôt be there for my wedding, and I want to reconnect but then when I think about what all went down I get frustrated and upset again.

Should I even bother to reach out, or were we just fighting for a friendship that has naturally seen its course? When I think about her now, I can only remember the good times, the memories we made when we were 15 and silly, not the frustration in our early 30s. Wish I could just get over it and let go.

1nbw8m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1nbw8m8/something_in_the_woods_copies_our_campfire_songs/,Something in the Woods Copies Our Campfire Songs,"I should have known something was wrong when Jake stopped singing along.

We'd been going to Camp Wildwood for three summers straight‚Äîme, Jake, Sarah, and Tommy. It wasn't anything fancy, just a patch of state forest up north where you could pitch a tent for twenty bucks a night. No cell service, no bathroom facilities, just you and the woods for miles in every direction. We loved it.

This was supposed to be our last trip before college scattered us across the country. Sarah had gotten into some fancy school in California, Tommy was heading to trade school, and Jake and I were staying local but figured things would never be quite the same. So we'd planned this final weekend, packed our usual supplies, and driven the four hours to our favorite spot beside Crystal Lake.

The first night went perfectly. We'd set up camp in our usual clearing, about fifty yards back from the water. Sarah had brought her guitar like always, and after we'd gotten a good fire going, she started playing the songs we'd been singing together for years. ""Country Roads,"" ""Sweet Caroline,"" all the classics that sound better when you're slightly off-key and surrounded by friends.

That's when I first heard it.

Just as Sarah finished the chorus of ""Country Roads,"" I swear I heard someone else singing the last line from somewhere in the trees behind us. The voice was faint, maybe carried on the wind, but it was definitely there. I looked around at the others, but they were already launching into the next verse, laughing at Tommy's attempt at harmonizing.

""Did you guys hear that?"" I asked during a break between songs.

""Hear what?"" Sarah adjusted her grip on the guitar neck.

""Someone singing. From the woods.""

Jake laughed. ""Probably just an echo off the lake, man. Sound does weird things out here.""

I nodded, but I wasn't convinced. The voice had sounded too clear, too deliberate to be an echo. Still, I didn't want to kill the mood, so I let it go.

The second night, it happened again.

We were sitting around the fire, and Sarah had just finished playing ""Puff the Magic Dragon""‚Äîa song that always made us feel like kids again, even though we were all eighteen. As the last chord faded, I heard it again: a voice from the darkness, singing the final line word for word.

This time, Jake heard it too. He sat up straighter, his head tilted toward the trees.

""What was that?"" he asked.

""I told you guys yesterday,"" I said. ""There's someone out there.""

""It's probably just another campsite,"" Sarah said, though she sounded less certain than the night before. ""Sound carries weird in the forest.""

We sat in silence for a moment, listening. The usual night sounds surrounded us‚Äîcrickets, the distant hoot of an owl, wind rustling through leaves. But no voices, no other campers.

Tommy grabbed a flashlight and swept it across the tree line. The beam illuminated nothing but trunks and undergrowth, shadows dancing as the light moved.

""Maybe we should check the camp registry when we head out,"" Jake suggested. ""See if there are other people nearby.""

But I'd already seen the registry when we signed in. We were the only ones registered for this section of the forest.

The third night changed everything.

Sarah had just started playing ""House of the Rising Sun""‚Äîa newer addition to our campfire repertoire that she'd been practicing all summer. She was only halfway through the first verse when the voice joined in.

This time, it wasn't singing the words we'd already finished. It was harmonizing with Sarah in real time, note for note, word for word. The voice came from multiple directions now, as if whatever was out there had moved around our camp while singing.

Sarah's fingers froze on the strings. The guitar fell silent, but the voice in the woods continued singing for another few seconds before it, too, stopped.

The silence that followed felt suffocating.

""That's not an echo,"" Tommy whispered.

Jake stood up so fast he knocked over his camp chair. ""We need to leave. Right now.""

""Don't be ridiculous,"" Sarah said, but her voice was shaking. ""It's probably just‚Äî""

""Just what?"" Jake's voice cracked. ""Just some psycho who's been watching us for three days? Learning our songs?""

I wanted to argue, but the fear in Jake's voice matched what I was feeling. This wasn't some innocent camper at a distant site. This was something else, something that had been observing us, studying us.

""Let's just pack up in the morning,"" I said, trying to be the voice of reason. ""We'll leave first thing.""

But as I said it, the voice started up again. This time it wasn't singing‚Äîit was talking. Repeating our conversation back to us in a voice that sounded almost like mine, but not quite right.

""Let's just pack up in the morning. We'll leave first thing.""

Then it repeated Sarah's words: ""It's probably just‚Äî""

Then Tommy's: *""That's not an echo.""

Each phrase came from a different spot in the darkness, as if multiple people were positioned around our camp, throwing our own words back at us.

Jake grabbed the biggest flashlight we had and started walking toward the trees. ""Show yourself!"" he shouted. ""What do you want?""

I caught his arm. ""Don't. Just don't.""

But it was too late. The voice responded, using Jake's own words:  ""Show yourself! What do you want?""

But this time, it wasn't coming from the woods. It was coming from behind us, from the direction of our tents.

We spun around, flashlight beams cutting through the darkness. Nothing. But as we stood there, breathing hard and trying to make sense of what was happening, we heard it again.

Singing.

It was ""Country Roads,"" the first song Sarah had played three nights ago. But now there were four voices singing it, each one slightly different, each one an imperfect copy of one of ours. My voice, Jake's voice, Sarah's voice, Tommy's voice‚Äîall singing together from somewhere in the darkness beyond our fire's reach.

The harmony was beautiful and terrifying.

We didn't sleep that night. We sat back-to-back around the dying fire, flashlights in hand, listening to our own voices singing our favorite songs back to us from the woods. Sometimes the singing would stop, and we'd hear our conversations from earlier in the weekend being replayed‚Äîdiscussions about college, inside jokes, even private moments when we thought no one else was listening.

When dawn finally came, we packed our gear in record time. Nobody talked about what had happened. We just wanted to get out of there.

It wasn't until we were loading the car that I realized Jake hadn't said a word all morning. He'd helped pack, nodded when we asked him questions, but he hadn't actually spoken since the night before.

""You okay, man?"" I asked him as we secured the tent to the roof rack.

He looked at me, opened his mouth as if to speak, then closed it again. He tried a second time, and when words finally came out, they weren't in his voice.

They were in mine.

""You okay, man?"" he said, using my exact intonation, my exact tone.

That was six months ago. We never talked about what happened at Camp Wildwood, not once. Sarah and Tommy went off to their schools, and Jake and I started at the local community college. Everything seemed normal.

Except Jake never speaks in his own voice anymore.

At first, I thought maybe I was imagining it. But over time, I've realized that every word Jake says is something one of us said during those three days in the woods. He speaks using our voices, our inflections, our words‚Äîlike he's some kind of recording device playing back conversations from that weekend.

The others don't seem to notice. When Jake talks, they respond normally, as if nothing's wrong. But I hear it. I hear Sarah's voice coming out of his mouth when he orders coffee. I hear Tommy's laugh when Jake thinks something's funny. I hear my own voice when he's trying to be serious.

And sometimes, late at night when I'm trying to fall asleep, I swear I can hear singing outside my window. Four voices harmonizing to songs we used to sing around the campfire, getting more perfect each time.

I think something came back with us from those woods. Something that's still learning, still copying, still watching.

And I'm starting to wonder if Jake is the only one it took.

About the dog:
Her name is Peppy and is a former small Rescue dog from Romania. She never had allergies whatsoever. She is normally hyperactive, playful and loves to dig holes, adores other people. But almost at the same time with the disappearance of the mud-hill(they build a house) she stopped being active. She is very Apathetic, suddenly she's very Greedy. She started pissing in the kitchen. She walks very stiffly. She got fat. Somehow her vision got bad(out of the blue!). At first the thought that perhaps she behaved weird due to the lack of the hill for her digging. Then the other changes quickly happend and her husband created an alternative for peppy on the garden. Her big Blood-test came back Unobtrusive, still the first vet said it could be hormonal and she took meds. She didn't got better. And then the rest of the symptoms came. She did hydro-therapy, Physiotherapy. And still no improvement. My sister visited many vets. What are your advices?

I'm curious to hear what men have to say about walking dates. I understand that meeting off of an app, it would be weird to suggest a really elaborate date (dinner, etc), but suggesting you just go on a walk together feels so incredibly low effort that it's almost insulting. Am I overthinking this? 

A man invited me over to his house almost immediately on the apps and I said I don't go over to strangers' houses. He then suggested going on a walk with his dogs (and then maybe to his house if things felt okay) which felt like he was asking me to do chores together instead of setting time aside to goo on a proper date. It feels like the general approach among men is ""what is the absolute lowest amount of time and energy I can invest in order to potentially get laid?"" 

I don't know, I might be overthinking this. I totally understand apps have changed the game and the first meeting should be casual and cheap. But it's a little disheartening to see how low the bar is, going on a date should be a fun thoughtful experience, not something that feels like a box to check, right? Asking someone to walk your dogs with you in a location that's convenient for you feels do icky, at least put in two brain cells worth of thought.

Edit: I feel like I wasn't very clear in my first post. I love going for walks, and I don't have anything against a walking date in general. My issue was with a man first spending zero time trying to connect over text and immediately inviting me over to his house, which as a woman I find insulting because that's obviously a dangerous thing to do. First red flag. What I was looking for wasn't more money spent, but some thoughtfulness. Going from ""come over for pizza"" to ""okay well let's walk around my house and do something I was already going to need to do, and then we can go to my house after"" just felt icky. I'll also add that I live about a half hour from where he lives. You don't know me and you don't owe me anything fancy, but it feels like men nowadays are just concerned with making sure things are convenient and easy for them. Spend a couple minutes googling a nice park, grab a coffee, etc. Setting aside an hour or two to connect with a new person thoughtfully feels pretty bare minimum to me.",0,1757356940.0,AskMen,103,0.24,False

1nbw2jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nbw2jz/i_m37_am_feeling_defeated_in_my_marriage_with_f29/,I (M37) am feeling defeated in my marriage with (F29) and need some advice. (long read),"So I just got back from a trip. My wife and I have been together for 9 years and officially we have been married for about 2 years. I had to go on a trip for a bachelor trip (my sister is getting married) and my wife is going on a bachelorette trip next weekend, followed by a 3-day work event that she needs to be out of town for. Since I know she will be extremely sleep deprived I asked her to take it easy this weekend and to get some rest while I am gone because the following weekend is going to take a lot out of her. She proceeded to deep clean the entire house including scrubbing the walls, organizing everything, and cleaning the oven. She sacrificed her rest and sleep doing a deep clean on every part of our house. I have expressed my gratitude for that by sending her some money from my account ( please look up ""How Should Married People Manage Their Bank Accounts?"" by Steve Harvey on how we structure our finances for context). I sent her money so that I can personally cover dinner since I am out of town that weekend and kept reminding her that I can help clean when I get home and rest/sleep is the priority for this weekend). I have also thanked her and praised her multiple time in person and via text.

The night/day of me traveling back home I had gone to bed at 10pm to wake up at 5am so I can drive 4 hours to make it to a 12pm flight. That night I fell asleep at about 10:20pm and woke up at 11:15pm with a full blown panic attack and anxiety like I haven't felt in my whole life. I proceeded to take my anxiety medication which subdued that panic attack. I tried to fall asleep again but kept tossing and turning and having mini panic attacks throughout my attempts to fall asleep till about 3am when I consulted chat GPT on what would be a more strategic move to keep trying to fall asleep or drive to the airport (4 hours away) and try and get a sleep pod to nap for about 3.5 hours before it was time to board. It recommended to drive to the airport at 3am to get there at 6am and check into the pods at 7am wake up y30 min before your flight so that your better rested.

I then communicated this to my wife via text and she was against that idea from the start but I was already convinced to proceed. She wanted me to change flights and come back later in the evening so I could try and fall asleep, sleep in, and get home around 7/8pm. I looked and there were no availability so I proceeded with what Chat GPT suggested. On the way she kept texting me periodically asking for status reports and I kept texting her to get some rest and sleep bc she is going to need it for next weekend. I got to the airport at around 6:30am and got to the sleep pods at 7am only to discover that they are full. I had to wait till 8:15am for a pod to open up and take. I slept for like an hour before the noise from the airport and the pod staff kept waking me up. By the time I had to board my plane I had a total of 2 hours of broken anxiety filled sleep. I slept maybe another hour on the plane and landed at 2pm.

The moment the wheels touched the ground I texted my wife (as she volunteered to pick me up from the airport) that I have landed. I then texted her that the pilot said that our gate will be available in about 30 seconds. Now while trying to exit the plan my wife texted me ""are you out of the plane yet?"" in which I was trying to walk down the aisle of the plan and go through the gate when I got a 'Hello?"" in which I responded ""just got out of the gate"" and she responded with ""ok tell me when your outside and what section you are in"" so I am walking to the escalators when I receive another text saying ""are you outside yet?"" in which one handed trying to text ""Im going down the escalator will be outside shortly"" in which she fired back instantly ""you are bad at communicating"" in which I ignored and brushed off. I got outside and told her exactly where I was only to respond with ""god your in the worst place there are cones blocking the lane to park and get you."" I texted ""oh im sorry here im moving in front of the cones."" She made it to my location shortly after. No getting out of the car and hug me, no ""hey babe"" I instantly put my bags in the car and the second my butt touches the seat she begins to criticize me on how much I suck at communication which I am so sleep deprived at this moment I calmly say ""i can't to this with you right now"" and remained silent disassociating with everything she was yelling to me about till I couldn't handle it and yelled back. I ignored her for the rest of the car ride. During the silence I kept remembering seeing all the other couples and families and friends who got picked up with smiles and hugs and all the warmest welcomes and it got me super depressed that all I get is being yelled at.

We proceeded to get home in which I immediately unpack not daring to disrespect her cleaning, and noticed she hasn't unpacked from a trip that she took about a month ago so I decided to help unpack her stuff too when she all the sudden said ""i left it unpacked for a reason so I don't have to repack for this coming weekend"" in a very hostile tone. After some silence we proceed to get into a very heated argument to the point I repacked and was heading to a hotel. Midway to a hotel she called and said ""come home and lets work things out"" I agreed and we ended up working things out for the most part but still being very distant to me. I took a sleeping pill last night to help knock me out and get me some quality sleep. She woke me up several times in the night telling me to stop snoring. Mind you she snores too and even louder than I do. She even claimed she tried sleeping on the couch until me coughing kept her up even more. This morning she tried getting in the bed and said I gave her little to no space to sleep in so I got up and moved to the couch and knocked out again until she woke me up saying ""your in my spot to work can you go to the bed"" (She works from home sometimes). Noticing the time I wake up and force myself to shower and get to work myself in our community/HOA offices that are in the community facilities (where the pool is and everything I work from home full time). I proceeded to make some coffee when she said that the noise I was making was annoying and if I could please stop. I stopped and thought I could just get something from the vending machines in the community area. When I vocalized that I was leaving and I love her she proceeds to yell and criticizes me on how I kept her up all night and how I am a problem and how my actions have affected her significantly on how much rest she is not getting all because of me, and that she has 2 trips back to back next weekend and next week and she needs all the rest she can. I proceed to leave until she said ""so your not making coffee"" in which I reminded her that my noise and coughing was disturbing her and I am choosing not to make it, her response is 'just make it' so i did and told her again ""good bye I love you"" and left with coffee in my hand.

Now the real thing here is I need some direction on how to navigate this because me returning home doesn't feel like home anymore and there seems to be no love, no signs of missing me, no cuddling last night, just pure coldness and bitterness ever since I landed.",5,1757356921.0,Advice,24,0.78,False

We‚Äôve been friends since we were 15, and now we‚Äôre both in our early 30s. It‚Äôs been a long friendship, and not the first time we‚Äôve had issues, but usually we resolved them. This time we didn‚Äôt. For some context: we grew up in the same city but went to college in different places. Even then we stayed close, writing letters and spending time together during breaks. After college, she moved back home and I stayed in my city. Later, she moved to a different town and I visited her there. In 2022 she moved to my city, and I helped her find an apartment. From the day she arrived, I was at her place helping her unpack. I introduced her to my friends, some of whom she already knew from past visits. That‚Äôs when a lot of our issues started.

We had never lived in the same city as adults before, and I think she was frustrated that I wasn‚Äôt always available. I was living with my now fianc√©, but I felt responsible for showing up whenever she wanted to hang out. She started spending time with my friends without me, which didn‚Äôt bother me, but sometimes I felt left out and jealous when they made memories together. Most of the time we all hung out as a group. At the same time, I felt like our personalities were drifting. We argued because I felt she was virtue signaling or being overly general in ways that felt polarizing.

There was one party where a friend of my fianc√©‚Äôs yelled at her for the above, which was not okay. I suggested we leave - I felt so bad and he did later apologize but she then held onto resentment that I had not argued with him on her behalf after he yelled, and instead suggested that we go home. When I was apartment-hunting in her neighborhood, she helped me, but later, in fights, said she felt used because she thought we weren‚Äôt as close anymore. I think both of us avoided sharing frustrations directly, which meant resentment built up.

The major falling out happened on her birthday trip abroad. Before the trip we had argued but seemed to be repairing things. I even got coffee with her to ask if she really wanted me there. She said yes and I apologized for my part in our earlier tiff. On the trip, though, things unraveled. She had planned poorly and was upset about how it was going. One night at karaoke, I sang first and then stepped outside for air. My two friends followed me, which upset her. She thought I was trying to make everyone leave. I explained I wasn‚Äôt, but she didn‚Äôt believe me. At the next bar she began ignoring me. I left early that night because I didn‚Äôt want to be blamed for something I hadn‚Äôt done. The rest of the trip was tense. She didn‚Äôt speak to me directly, only to others. I tried to keep the peace, but on the way home I learned she had been talking badly about me to her other friends, saying she only invited me so that my two friends would come. After the trip, we never spoke again. She did reach out to my two friends, but when she tried to bring me up, they changed the subject and wouldn‚Äôt engage.

The issue is that I‚Äôm getting married in a month. This whole year of wedding planning has me feeling extremely nostalgic, and given me a lot of perspective on the people in my life, my true friendships and those that don‚Äôt matter as much anymore. I‚Äôm torn by how awfully things ended with me and this friend. I‚Äôve had two years to think about all the reasons why she wanted to blame me for how badly the trip went, the trying to connect and talk badly about me to my other friends, the resentment, and I concluded everytime that we were frustrated with how our friendship was developing but I still have a lot of love for her. It makes me so sad to think she won‚Äôt be there for my wedding, and I want to reconnect but then when I think about what all went down I get frustrated and upset again.

Should I even bother to reach out, or were we just fighting for a friendship that has naturally seen its course? When I think about her now, I can only remember the good times, the memories we made when we were 15 and silly, not the frustration in our early 30s.",1,1757356881.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False

1nbvy11,https://www.reddit.com/r/augmentedreality/comments/1nbvy11/halliday_is_currently_a_mess/,Halliday is currently a mess,"I attempted to post a version of this on r/Halliday yesterday, but it wasn't approved by the mods. For the sake of discussion, consumer transparency, and just to rant, I'm sharing my opinion on Halliday's marketing and product management here on r/augmentedreality.

Disclaimer: I have no experience starting or running a company, nor in marketing or crowdfunding. My perspective is based on my experience as an early backer on this project.
TLDR at the end.


I won't delve into all of the infamous delays, but I do want to discuss the disconnect between the project's marketing and its development.

The initial concept for Halliday glasses was refreshing and seemed built on the principle of minimalism. It promised a stylish device with color options, featuring a subtle, monochrome display for quick context without distracting from real life. It appeared to be an honest attempt at innovative, functional, and discreet tech that could be intuitively integrated into daily life, and I really liked this approach.

However, the aggressive presale marketing starting from right after the kickstarter campaign was wrapped up till now, seems at odds with the persistent production issues. This suggests they likely have encountered troubles with their priorities. In my opinion, the company is acting like a coffee shop that invests heavily in branded merchandise to work up buzz and get the locals to visit their establishment, but they still don't know how to make a good cup of coffee.

Instead of focusing on their core audience of dedicated and forgiving early adopters, who would likely have navigated a few bumps for a quality product, Halliday has poured resources into a massive social media campaign. The heavy marketing on Instagram and a recent T-shirt contest‚Äîasking the fewer than 2,000 backers who have received their product for positive reviews‚Äîcame across as tacky.

Critics are told to be patient because Halliday is a Kickstarter project and delays are normal. While true, Halliday appears to be in a uniquely privileged position compared to many direct-to-consumer Kickstarters. They have big sponsors and enough resources to employ a full marketing team, yet their engineering team and partners seem to be scrambling to figure out basic product features. This is far from a small team facing standard crowdfunding setbacks; to me, their approach looks like greed and a lack of professionalism.

Just because they haven't run off with the money doesn't make them immune to criticism. They chose to launch multiple additional preorder campaigns for an unfinished product they couldn't produce on a small scale, despite exceeding their initial funding goals. 

They tried to appeal to the masses before their product was ready for prime time. Then, they tried to leverage the few backers who received their glasses to create an illusion of progress and a community of happy customers to drive even more presales. This happened despite production being unstable and the majority of their initial backers are still waiting for their products.

Perhaps if they had used Kickstarter as an ultimate early-access test group‚Äîsending out prototypes as one of the perks and communicating a revised Q3-Q4 release based on community feedback, they could have fine-tuned the product with fewer distractions and better overall communication. They could have made mistakes on a smaller scale, within more controlled circumstances, but chose to make them on the world stage, where each mistake is magnified and far more expensive.

I've never run a crowdfunding campaign, so what do I know? I just think a different approach to sales and production would have made a huge difference. Instead, they seem to have bitten off more than they can chew, and then tried to go in for seconds, while still being unable to chew.

At this point, I keep thinking, why should a person looking to buy AR glasses go for Halliday? They lack promised features, and the ones they do have are, as of now, underwhelming. And unless you pick the black frames from the shop, you can count on the frames taking even longer do to production difficulties related to the colored frames.**

To make matters worse for Halliday competitors like Brilliant Labs are working on the Halo glasses with their own take on an optical display similar to the digi-window. They are planned to ship in late November, quite possibly around the same time as Halliday.

Based on photos of the Halo glasses, the display looks more noticeable than Halliday's, you have to order prescription frames separately from SmartBuyGlases, and they only have one frame style planned out for now. But the Halo glasses do have many more features‚Äîa hidden low-res camera for AI context clues, an open-source platform capable of making personalized app with natural language using vibe coding which sounds awesome, a color LCD display, and bone-conducting audio for privacy. And the preorder price (without prescription lenses) is surprisingly slightly lower than the price point of the presale Hallidays, but you have to pay for shipping so it evens out. 

Coulda, woulda, shoulda. I don't think it's too late for Halliday to improve their business model, but they really need to regroup and reprioritize their efforts and money.
Answering emails and offering free returns would likely generate far more positive publicity than campaigning with a T-shirt that has, ""my glasses are smarter than yours,"" written on them, or an extra pair of cheap sunglasses.

But what do I know, I'm just an old man yelling into the void.

________________

TL;DR: Halliday's marketing is overly aggressive and misaligned with the company's production and development issues. The company is prematurely focused on large-scale presales and marketing campaigns, while failing to deliver its core product to existing customers.

She rushes out, thanking me in this adorable, non-fluent Chinese accent ‚Äî just to help paint the image ‚Äî and starts heading toward the escalator.

But the escalator was broken. Blocked off with one of those folding barriers. The elevator had just closed with people inside. So I told her, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not supposed to do this, but go ahead,‚Äù and I moved the barrier so she could slip through and run up the stairs. She thanked me again ‚Äî super sweet ‚Äî and I went back to work.

Later, I ran into her again in the garage. Turns out she had rushed to the restroom without paying for parking first, and now she was trying to figure that out. She‚Äôd never been to this mall before, and honestly, the parking system *is* confusing if you‚Äôre not used to it.

I do this stuff all day ‚Äî it‚Äôs basically muscle memory now ‚Äî so I walked her through it step-by-step. I always try to keep people relaxed, crack little jokes here and there, and make things easy. She was visibly relieved. I told her not to stress, there was no rush, and that everything would get sorted. She just smiled and kept thanking me. Multiple times.

Then, *again*, I run into her in a totally different zone. She‚Äôs asking about coffee shops this time, and we end up chatting for a few minutes. And at some point ‚Äî I don‚Äôt even remember exactly what I said ‚Äî she smiles, says, ‚ÄúThank you, baby,‚Äù and walks off.

For context, I am very sensitive to stimulants. Even coffee makes my heart beat out of my chest so I can‚Äôt drink much at a time. I am also very anxiety prone and was diagnosed with anxiety before my adhd. 

I (26) got diagnosed 3 months ago with primarily inattentive adhd. My psych tells me I am a textbook ‚Äúhigh achieving in school so I got through but was always chaotic internally‚Äù presentation. I finally got diagnosed because it‚Äôs affecting my work. 

We first tried Vyvanse 20mg, then 30 and 40, but I didn‚Äôt feel like it made a huge difference in my ability to initiate and finish tasks. It did make me anxious, high heart rate, and sometimes sad, so my psych concluded maybe vyvanse isn‚Äôt for me. 

Now we‚Äôre trying IR adderall. I started at 10mg and now im trying 15.  I tolerate this better so far, I have less of the anxious feeling in my chest and stomach (although it‚Äôs still there low grade) and more energy, but I don‚Äôt feel more focused. My brain still feels scattered. I‚Äôm writing this even though I should be working lol because I can‚Äôt focus. 

I‚Äôm getting nervous that maybe stimulants just won‚Äôt work for me? When I asked my doctor how I will know it‚Äôs working, she said ‚Äúyou‚Äôll know. Most patients say it‚Äôs like a lightbulb turning on.‚Äù And I just haven‚Äôt felt that way at all. I‚Äôm nervous that I won‚Äôt be able to tolerate higher doses of stimulants because I‚Äôm physically very sensitive to them. 

Has anyone else gone thru something similar and had success or take anything else alongside a stimulant to mitigate the physical reaction?

(For more details, consult Article 19 of the [proposal](https://img.lalr.co/cms/2025/09/01114632/PROYECTO-DE-LEY-DE-FINANCIAMIENTO-2025-PUB_1_09_2025.pdf)).

Let me put it plainly: what the government plans to do with wealth taxes is extreme. If the reform passes, Colombia will have, quite literally, the harshest wealth taxes in the world. And this could be very bad news not just for high-net-worth individuals, but for the country as a whole.

To see why, let‚Äôs first look at why these taxes are so widely criticized by experts.

# 1. Why Wealth Taxes Are So Criticized

Wealth taxes may be popular among politicians, but experts criticize them for many reasons:

* **High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs) are hard to tax.** They can limit their days in the country to avoid tax residency. They may move assets abroad, use trusts, corporations, or ‚Äúinsurance wrappers,‚Äù transfer assets as gifts to family members, or set up foundations. As international experience has shown, taxing the wealthy effectively and efficiently on their net worth is a very difficult goal to attain.
* **Wealth taxes reduce incentives to save and invest locally.** Taxing wealth directly discourages capital accumulation and investment, harming productivity and growth. Like everyone else, wealthy individuals respond to incentives. A renowned artist, for example, who sees his net worth approaching the threshold, may cut back on work, creating what economists call a *deadweight loss*: production of goods and services below the socially optimal level.
* **Wealth taxes trigger capital flight.** Wealthy individuals invest where conditions are most favorable. If taxes are high in Colombia, they may move capital to other countries. Wealth taxes encourage shifting wealth abroad while discouraging keeping it at home.
* **Wealth taxes are very difficult to administer.** Wealth taxes are notoriously complex to enforce. They raise valuation challenges (e.g., how do you value an art collection?), involve high collection costs relative to revenue, and create distortions and opportunities for avoidance or evasion.
* **They are largely ineffective at raising revenue.** Evidence from OECD countries shows that wealth taxes typically raise less than 1% of GDP, leading many countries to abolish them. In Colombia‚Äôs case, revenues might even decline as HNWIs leave with their assets. But try explaining the Laffer Curve to Gustavo Petro, a wizard at math (sarcasm).

In short, although some defend wealth taxes as tools to reduce inequality and limit wealth concentration, most experts reject them as distortionary, difficult to administer, and ineffective at raising revenue.

And here‚Äôs the key point: Colombia is not merely considering a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù wealth tax within OECD averages. The government wants to literally impose the highest wealth tax in the world‚Äîthus magnifying every single distortion and difficulty.

# 2. How Likely Is This Reform to Pass?

Here‚Äôs the good news: it‚Äôs unlikely that such a radical reform will pass in its current form. The proposal has already generated a firestorm on social media, with criticism from business leaders, academics, and even some within government.

Some suggest the reform is so poorly designed that it could only have been proposed intentionally, giving Mr. Petro an excuse for not fulfilling his campaign promises: *‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt change the country because the reform wasn‚Äôt approved.‚Äù*

Fortunately for those potentially affected (most of us in the country), this reform faces a difficult legislative path. Mr. Petro lacks a congressional majority, and historically, tax reforms in Colombia are watered down in Congress. This one faces especially strong opposition from both the private and public sectors. Moreover, many lawmakers know that in pre-election times, supporting such a reform could be very politically damaging.

That said, the probability of passage is not zero.

And if you‚Äôre a high-net-worth individual who happens to be a tax resident in Colombia, you shouldn‚Äôt just sit on your hands until Petro‚Äîor another politician‚Äîgoes after your wealth.

# 3. Preparing for Wealth Taxes in Colombia: What You Need to Know

You can‚Äôt leave your financial future at the mercy of populist politicians like Mr. Petro. You must take control of it.

Even if this particular reform has a low chance of passing, similar proposals could appear in the future. Like many other countries, Colombia faces a severe deficit and growing pension obligations for an aging population.

This means tax planning is not optional‚Äîit is essential if you wish to protect your wealth.

The first step is to understand how the wealth tax currently works and the opportunities it presents.

# 4. How Wealth Taxes in Colombia Currently Work

At present, wealth taxes in Colombia apply to assets minus liabilities exceeding **72,000 taxable units** (**COP 3,585,528,000** for 2025). You can learn more about the applicable thresholds and rates [here](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/colombia/individual/other-taxes).

For individuals, the first **13,500 UVT** (**COP 672,300,000** for 2025) of a Colombian house or apartment [may be excluded](https://estatuto.co/295-2) from the taxable base, but only if it is your primary residence. This makes the exclusion unusable for second homes, vacation properties, or for non-residents.

When it comes to legal persons, some non-resident companies can be subject to the tax, while domestic companies are not. (See [Article 292-3](https://estatuto.co/art-292-3-impuesto-al-patrimonio-sujetos-pasivos) of the *Estatuto Tributario* for more details.)

Thus, strategies for minimizing exposure depend on whether or not you are considered a tax resident.

# 5. What to Do If You‚Äôre Not a Tax Resident

If you are a non-resident individual, one way of avoiding the wealth tax in Colombia is keeping your net worth in the country below 72,000 taxable units (COP 3,585,528,000 in 2025).

The 13,500 UVT exemption for a primary residence does not apply in your case, because it requires that you spend most of your time there‚Äîan impossible condition for non-residents (except for foreign diplomats, who are not taxed anyway).

That means 72,000 UVT is your *magic number*. Keep it always in mind. If you plan to acquire assets in the country above this threshold, consult a qualified tax advisor first to minimize tax exposure.

# 6. What to Do If You Are a Tax Resident

Tax residents in Colombia are taxed on their [worldwide ](https://estatuto.co/9)net worth. That means everything you own‚Äîwhether gold in Australia or a house in Dubai‚Äîis counted. Because of this global reach, tax planning for residents is often more complex and almost always requires professional advice.

The following are not specific recommendations but general considerations for high-equity residents:

* **Use the 13,500 UVT exemption for your main home** (Article 295-2 of the *Estatuto Tributario*).
* **Diversify.** Don‚Äôt keep all assets in one jurisdiction or asset class. Consider geographic diversification and more mobile investments like crypto.
* **Think twice before getting a Colombian passport.** Nationals face [stricter residency criteria](https://estatuto.co/10), making it harder to stop being a tax resident later. Also, it's not unlikely that citizen-based taxation is discussed or implemented in the near future. 
* **Seek professional advice.** Competent advisors can suggest legal ways to minimize‚Äîor even avoid‚Äîthe tax without leaving the country. For example, they might recommend transferring certain assets to a spouse with a lower net worth. But such steps must be handled with care, as improper execution can amount to tax avoidance or even evasion.

# Final Thoughts ‚Äì The Way Forward

Colombia is, and has always been, an incredibly resilient country. I am confident we will survive this populist flirtation with punitive taxation, and that Congress will recognize there are fairer and more effective ways to fund the nation than driving wealthy individuals away.

Despite our fiscal challenges, I truly believe Colombia will remain an amazing place to live, invest, and do business.

I just got back from my week-long first solo trip to the Disney Bubble and wanted to write this little trip report up for you all while it's fresh in my mind. For real, you guys weren't kidding: solo trips are THE BEST! I really did get to do ""What I want, when I want"" and this has probably been the best trip I've had...ever. I hadn't had this much fun since I was a CM over 10 years ago.

Day 1: Arrival, Blizzard Beach/Disney Springs

-Room wasn't ready yet, which I accounted for. So I had quick-service at my resort (All-Star Sports). That Bases Loaded Burger is actually surprisingly good.

-Blizzard Beach was literally just me on the lazy river relaxing and people watching. The water park on arrival deal is a great value, I think, even if its only a couple hours of your time. 

-Cold Fashioned at Frostbite Freddy's is really good, I'm a fan.

Magic moment at Springs: Asked for a Shakin Jamaican Cold Brew with Irish cream, they were so kind and only rang me up for the regular cold brew drink!

Updated Magic moment: I got upgraded from standard to preferred! That was seriously a game changer, I literally didn't ask either. Sports CMs truly made the trip right from the get go.

-Homecomin' is no joke, delicious food and the portion sizes are quite a lot! Also the Tropical Itch cocktail is fantastic.

Day 2: Magic Kingdom

-Had one of many peaceful morning coffees outside at Sports. If you get a chance, relaxing in relative quiet before a long day of parks is sublime.

-Early Entry is awesome! Literally walked on Space Mountain no wait. Then hopped on over to Tron a little before official rope drop and literally only waited like 15 minutes max. I'm a believer now for Early Entry.

-I got to ride everything I wanted on a short park day due to Not-So-Scary party night. Some highlights: Haunted Mansion was awesome as always, Tiki Room was a great escape from the heat, Peoplemover was perfection, rode Astro Orbiter for the first time ever, Carousel of Progress made my heart happy, and Tiana's was a joy. Shoutout to the girls I rode with on Tiana's--gotta love that swamp water taste in your mouth lol!

-Jungle Cruise skipper was a blast! 

-Tony's was delicious for lunch. My family and I love ""new Tony's"", and dining solo was so relaxing.

-Magic Moment: Tron CM tells me to go into a row, other Tron CM comes over and overrides him and puts me in row 1!

-Ended park day with Tron again, and then went to Wilderness Lodge to have a drink at Geyser Point for the first time. CMs over there are fantastic, really made my day even more magical. 

Day 3: Hollywood Studios

-Another morning another peaceful coffee at Sports. CMs surprisingly let us in for Early Entry before Early Entry, first ride was Runaway Railway! Who doesn't love hearing ""Nothing Can Stop Us Now"" and dancing in the morning to the conga part?

-Today was probably the best day. Used combo Lightning Lanes and queues. Rode Runaway Railway twice, Rockin' Roller Coaster 4x, Tower of Terror 4x, Star Tours 3x, got in a Rise ride, Toy Story Mania, and Smugglers Run.

-Two magic moments: got two ride Alien Swirling Saucers twice in a row with no re-queue which was sweet, and then a wonderful CM fit me in to Oga's Cantina somehow when I couldn't get a reservation and there was a line! Shoutout to Oga's CMs, you guys are awesome.

-Sci-Fi Diner solo is still a great time. Don't be shy, just go and enjoy it--I was lucky enough to be sat with a very kind and social family.

-Frozen jack and cokes are life.

-Queue times were amazing! I honestly could have ride ToT and RnR way more times. I think I was just EXTREMELY lucky this whole trip with low crowds.

Day 4: EPCOT

-Early Entry Guardians was awesome-- between this and my second ride later in the day, still didn't get ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"" though.

-New Test Track is a winner. Love the new re-theme!

-Rode Soarin', Journey into Imagination, Seas, Land, 3 Caballeros and Mission Space. Only used LL for Soarin'.

-Magic moment: not even CMs this time, my boat in 3 Caballeros got stalled. Cue my whole boat singing the song together. Disney World lol

-Lunch for first time at San Angel Inn inside the Mexico Pavilion was amazing! Fantastic service and the shaved ribeye tacos were killer.

-Saw Canada Far and Wide for the first time, absolutely loved it. Such a beautiful movie even if it is kind of a tourism ad. Made me want to go there even more.

-Canada band is super good.

-Jammitors are awesome.

-F&W Fest was fantastic like it always is! Favorites include Tikka Masala (India), Spiced Apple Old Fashioned (Bramblewood), Beef Wagyu Don (Japan).
-Avocado marg at La Cava is the real deal! That's a dangerous drink for sure. 

-Ended the night watching Illlumina--I MEAN Luminous with a Sparkling Pineapple Wine (Hawaii), perfection.

Day 5: Animal Kingdom

-Very chill day, no Early Entry. Winged Encounters was a great way to start my park entrance (totally saw it on accident).

-Rode Dinosaur 5x and bought Dinosaur merch, RIP to one of my favorites since childhood.

-Rode Everest 4x. Y'all, even though queue was relatively low, Single Rider line is no joke. Like walk right on. 

-Magic moment: guys on one of my rides who played along with me about the ""track being broken"" and freaking out warning everybody there was a yeti haha, also the family that inducted me into their family on Dinosaur and we all had a blast for their kid.

-Flight of Passage is still awesome.

-Finished the night off with my bucket list item: the monorail bar crawl! Started at Wilderness Lodge (Smores Old Fashioned is absolutely amazing), then did Steakhouse 71 (Curious Cold Brew), Trader Sam's Tiki Terrace (Spiced Island), and Enchanted Rose (Rye Not). Really disappointed in Trader Sam's, that was the worst drink of the 4 that I had. Feel free to comment your thoughts on Sam's!

Day 6: Resort Hopping

-Just a chill day of resort hopping!

-Riviera is just beautiful. Wow. Le Petit's Cinammon Cold Brew was fantastic. Even the quick service spot is delicious. Had fun playing corn hole. Too bad I'll probably never be DVC.

-Contemporary...I get it now. The vibes there are immaculate! Low-key best thing for me for the entire day was getting an iced coffee, sitting outside under the monorail and just viewing the castle/astro orbiter/Space Mountain from afar as the monorail passes over.

-Poly Kona Cafe is really good. Poly is a fun resort especially for fireworks viewing at night.

-I now see why the Full House family stayed at the Grand Floridian. There's just an ambiance there that feels so...high class? The piano player in the lobby is also amazing!

-Dinner at Ale & Compass--fantastic service and just as amazing food! Yacht & Beach by themselves are also very cool resorts.

-Ended the night hanging at the Boardwalk. I just love the vibes there! Abracadabar was too packed so maybe next time. I still don't get the appeal of Cake Bake Shop.

Day 7: Leaving

-Checked out, the CMs at Sports truly were awesome. I would definitely stay there again, really. 

-Spent some time before going to MCO at Springs. I just really like Springs and shopping there.

Overall a FANTASTIC solo trip, ten out of ten will do again in the future! I know I was very, VERY lucky with low queue times pretty much every day, so for those reading: be prepared. It might happen, it might not, but don't bet on it 100%. 

I really do believe the magic is still there at Disney World. Has it gotten more expensive? Absolutely. Are there still rude guests? You bet. But CMs are still working hard to make magic, and they're only human. If you treat everyone around you at Disney World with genuine kindness (and not entitlement), I can pretty much guarantee you that you will have an amazing time there.

1nbvkno,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1nbvkno/i_m37_am_feeling_defeated_in_my_marriage_with_f29/,I (M37) am feeling defeated in my marriage with (F29) and need some advice. (long read),"So I just got back from a trip. My wife and I have been together for 9 years and officially we have been married for about 2 years. I had to go on a trip for a bachelor trip (my sister is getting married) and my wife is going on a bachelorette trip next weekend, followed by a 3-day work event that she needs to be out of town for. Since I know she will be extremely sleep deprived I asked her to take it easy this weekend and to get some rest while I am gone because the following weekend is going to take a lot out of her. She proceeded to deep clean the entire house including scrubbing the walls, organizing everything, and cleaning the oven. She sacrificed her rest and sleep doing a deep clean on every part of our house. I have expressed my gratitude for that by sending her some money from my account ( please look up ""How Should Married People Manage Their Bank Accounts?"" by Steve Harvey on how we structure our finances for context). I sent her money so that I can personally cover dinner since I am out of town that weekend and kept reminding her that I can help clean when I get home and rest/sleep is the priority for this weekend). I have also thanked her and praised her multiple time in person and via text.

The night/day of me traveling back home I had gone to bed at 10pm to wake up at 5am so I can drive 4 hours to make it to a 12pm flight. That night I fell asleep at about 10:20pm and woke up at 11:15pm with a full blown panic attack and anxiety like I haven't felt in my whole life. I proceeded to take my anxiety medication which subdued that panic attack. I tried to fall asleep again but kept tossing and turning and having mini panic attacks throughout my attempts to fall asleep till about 3am when I consulted chat GPT on what would be a more strategic move to keep trying to fall asleep or drive to the airport (4 hours away) and try and get a sleep pod to nap for about 3.5 hours before it was time to board. It recommended to drive to the airport at 3am to get there at 6am and check into the pods at 7am wake up y30 min before your flight so that your better rested.

I then communicated this to my wife via text and she was against that idea from the start but I was already convinced to proceed. She wanted me to change flights and come back later in the evening so I could try and fall asleep, sleep in, and get home around 7/8pm. I looked and there were no availability so I proceeded with what Chat GPT suggested. On the way she kept texting me periodically asking for status reports and I kept texting her to get some rest and sleep bc she is going to need it for next weekend. I got to the airport at around 6:30am and got to the sleep pods at 7am only to discover that they are full. I had to wait till 8:15am for a pod to open up and take. I slept for like an hour before the noise from the airport and the pod staff kept waking me up. By the time I had to board my plane I had a total of 2 hours of broken anxiety filled sleep. I slept maybe another hour on the plane and landed at 2pm.

The moment the wheels touched the ground I texted my wife (as she volunteered to pick me up from the airport) that I have landed. I then texted her that the pilot said that our gate will be available in about 30 seconds. Now while trying to exit the plan my wife texted me ""are you out of the plane yet?"" in which I was trying to walk down the aisle of the plan and go through the gate when I got a 'Hello?"" in which I responded ""just got out of the gate"" and she responded with ""ok tell me when your outside and what section you are in"" so I am walking to the escalators when I receive another text saying ""are you outside yet?"" in which one handed trying to text ""Im going down the escalator will be outside shortly"" in which she fired back instantly ""you are bad at communicating"" in which I ignored and brushed off. I got outside and told her exactly where I was only to respond with ""god your in the worst place there are cones blocking the lane to park and get you."" I texted ""oh im sorry here im moving in front of the cones."" She made it to my location shortly after. No getting out of the car and hug me, no ""hey babe"" I instantly put my bags in the car and the second my butt touches the seat she begins to criticize me on how much I suck at communication which I am so sleep deprived at this moment I calmly say ""i can't to this with you right now"" and remained silent disassociating with everything she was yelling to me about till I couldn't handle it and yelled back. I ignored her for the rest of the car ride. During the silence I kept remembering seeing all the other couples and families and friends who got picked up with smiles and hugs and all the warmest welcomes and it got me super depressed that all I get is being yelled at.

We proceeded to get home in which I immediately unpack not daring to disrespect her cleaning, and noticed she hasn't unpacked from a trip that she took about a month ago so I decided to help unpack her stuff too when she all the sudden said ""i left it unpacked for a reason so I don't have to repack for this coming weekend"" in a very hostile tone. After some silence we proceed to get into a very heated argument to the point I repacked and was heading to a hotel. Midway to a hotel she called and said ""come home and lets work things out"" I agreed and we ended up working things out for the most part but still being very distant to me. I took a sleeping pill last night to help knock me out and get me some quality sleep. She woke me up several times in the night telling me to stop snoring. Mind you she snores too and even louder than I do. She even claimed she tried sleeping on the couch until me coughing kept her up even more. This morning she tried getting in the bed and said I gave her little to no space to sleep in so I got up and moved to the couch and knocked out again until she woke me up saying ""your in my spot to work can you go to the bed"" (She works from home sometimes). Noticing the time I wake up and force myself to shower and get to work myself in our community/HOA offices that are in the community facilities (where the pool is and everything I work from home full time). I proceeded to make some coffee when she said that the noise I was making was annoying and if I could please stop. I stopped and thought I could just get something from the vending machines in the community area. When I vocalized that I was leaving and I love her she proceeds to yell and criticizes me on how I kept her up all night and how I am a problem and how my actions have affected her significantly on how much rest she is not getting all because of me, and that she has 2 trips back to back next weekend and next week and she needs all the rest she can. I proceed to leave until she said ""so your not making coffee"" in which I reminded her that my noise and coughing was disturbing her and I am choosing not to make it, her response is 'just make it' so i did and told her again ""good bye I love you"" and left with coffee in my hand.

Now the real thing here is I need some direction on how to navigate this because me returning home doesn't feel like home anymore and there seems to be no love, no signs of missing me, no cuddling last night, just pure coldness and bitterness ever since I landed.",1,1757355796.0,WhatShouldIDo,9,0.6,False

1nbvdot,https://i.redd.it/zqyozssqfznf1.jpeg,THE HOT SPOT: Facing cancer in Iowa: Patients share their stories,"# Cancer in Iowa isn‚Äôt just about treatment‚Äîit‚Äôs about surviving the system, asking why it happened, and living with the aftermath. Five Iowans share their stories.

*A version of this story first appeared in the*¬†[*Aug. 19 edition*](https://link.iowastartingline.com/public/41202588)¬†*of the Iowa Starting Line newsletter.*¬†[*Subscribe to our newsletter*](https://iowastartingline.com/newsletter/)¬†*to get an exclusive first look at a new story each Tuesday in our The Hot Spot: Investigating Cancer in Iowa series.*

Gano Whetstone settled into the infusion chair at Des Moines‚Äô Mission Cancer + Blood and asked for her usual: black coffee and a warm blanket. On treatment days, she takes the paratransit bus to the hospital, arriving early to wait in the lobby until it‚Äôs her time.

The 80-year-old retired teacher has done this routine every three weeks for nearly a year now. The nurse wheels over a machine and hooks it up to Whetstone‚Äôs infusion port‚Äîa device surgically installed in her shoulder that allows her to receive her slow drip of Herceptin on treatment days without requiring the poke of a needle.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel anything,‚Äù she says, watching the IV work. ‚ÄúI just sit here, drink my coffee, and watch TV.‚Äù

It sounds mundane, but Whetstone said catching the cancer feels miraculous.

Last July during a routine mammogram, doctors found what was likely a cancerous tumor in her breast tissue.

‚ÄúI just looked at the floor,‚Äù she said, as the doctor delivered the news.

For the last year, Whetstone has been navigating the aftermath of that moment‚Äîa journey familiar to many cancer patients across Iowa who face a complex matrix of decisions about their care.

This week on¬†[The Hot Spot: Investigating Cancer in Iowa,](https://iowastartingline.com/cancer-in-iowa/)¬†we‚Äòre sharing some of those stories. Cancer in Iowa isn‚Äôt just about receiving a diagnosis and figuring out the right treatment. It‚Äôs¬†navigating hurdles related to insurance and care; wondering what might have caused the disease in the first place; and living with the physical and emotional aftermath long after the last scan.

Whetstone‚Äôs doctor offered her three options: radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. When her mother went through cancer treatment decades earlier, she remembered watching her struggle with the side effects of chemo. Seeing her mother lose her hair was a memory that stuck with her.

‚ÄúYou never really understand a lot of it when they‚Äôre explaining it to you,‚Äù Whetstone said.

Instead of chemotherapy or radiation, she decided to go with immunotherapy because it had side effects she was willing to manage. Keeping her hair was a bonus.

Her doctor prescribed a course of Herceptin. It‚Äôs sometimes used to treat breast and stomach cancers by blocking a particular protein that promotes cancer cell growth. The drug is estimated to have saved more than¬†[3 million lives](https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/25-years-herceptin-groundbreaking-advancement-breast-cancer)¬†since its introduction in 1998. The rub: Herceptin‚Äîa brand name for the chemical trastuzumab‚Äîis expensive.

Whetstone said each infusion treatment costs around $5,000, a fortune on a fixed income. Even with Medicare, Whetstone couldn‚Äôt afford the mounting costs. She applied for an elderly waiver to get Medicaid coverage, then hit another wall when the surgeon‚Äôs office initially said they wouldn‚Äôt take her insurance. Three phone calls and three-and-a-half weeks of waiting later, she finally got approval for the surgery.

‚ÄúIf \[the insurance companies\] make mistakes and stuff, you know, then you‚Äôre stuck waiting,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd you can‚Äôt have your surgery or treatment because they have to get the insurance straightened out.‚Äù

Whetstone lives in an apartment complex with a number of other elderly Iowans. When they meet once a week in the common area to talk about politics or the news, she said she wonders how her neighbors would fare navigating the system.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way they can do this themselves,‚Äù she said. (She herself had help thanks to a service coordinator from Broadlawns Medical Center.)

As the machine beeps to signal her treatment is finished, Whetstone cautiously reflected on the road ahead. In two weeks, she‚Äôll have her final infusion. And come September, a mammogram will determine if she‚Äôs in remission.

‚ÄúThey said, it looks good, and I feel really confident that it‚Äôll be okay,‚Äù Whetstone said. ‚ÄúBut the thing is, I did this before.‚Äù

Before starting her first dose of Herceptin, surgeons operated to remove the tumor in Whetstone‚Äôs breast. But within weeks, the cancer came back, and she needed a mastectomy. Now, with her immunotherapy complete, she hopes next month‚Äôs mammogram brings good news.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna get false hope in here,‚Äù Whetstone said, ‚Äúbecause I did last time. A lot of times I don‚Äôt even think about it. I just ‚Ä¶ go to the activities of my building and, you know, meet people and do things.‚Äù

# Rick Widman, Altoona

When Rick Widman was diagnosed in 2007 with ‚Äächronic lymphocytic leukemia, he wasn‚Äôt surprised.

His grandmother and an older brother both died of blood cancer; his mother died of breast cancer when he was a kid. All had lived on the family farm in Storm Lake.

Widman lists off others: His neighbor down the street. A classmate and her brother.

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs just been all over the place, you know?‚Äù Widman said.

Now living in Altoona, Widman has his theories: He points to widely used herbicides glyphosate and atrazine, along with the petroleum chemical benzene. He also remembers using the insecticide DDT prior to its ban in 1972, and the herbicides 2,4-D and dicamba.

**RELATED:**¬†[**How pesticides help fuel Iowa‚Äôs cancer crisis**](https://iowastartingline.com/cancer-in-iowa/pesticides-fuel-cancer-iowa-crisis/)

‚ÄúMy brother and I always thought that it had something to do with exposure to something on the farm,‚Äù Widman said.

His family‚Äôs case was interesting enough that Mayo Clinic is including Widman and his family in a study of families with blood and lymph node cancers. Widman says more of that research is needed.

‚ÄúThe federal government is cutting cancer research; they‚Äôre just doing the total opposite of what they should be doing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd, really, the state‚Äôs not really doing as much as they should be doing. ‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a priority.‚Äù

# AnMarie Rodgers, formerly of Newton

AnMarie Rodgers was diagnosed at age 55 with small cell lung cancer in summer 2024, and successfully had surgery to remove a piece ‚Äúthe size of a mango‚Äù from her lung. Fortunately, she did not have to undergo chemotherapy or radiation treatment.

‚ÄúMy surgeon is optimistic, and thinks if I get through five years, I have a pretty good outlook for a normal life,‚Äù said Rodgers, a Newton native now living in Oakland, California.

Recently, she had another lung scan on the one-year anniversary of her diagnosis, and said it ‚Äúcame back with no sign of recurrence, which is a huge relief.‚Äù

But Rodgers doesn‚Äôt have a history of smoking, so it surprised her to be diagnosed at all.

‚ÄúThe doctor said that the¬†[rise of lung cancer in women who have never smoked](https://www.cdc.gov/lung-cancer/nonsmokers/index.html)¬†is pretty widespread right now,‚Äù she said.

Research points to one likely factor that Iowa has plenty of:¬†[radon](https://www.cdc.gov/radon/about/index.html).

Rodgers grew up in an upstairs bedroom of the family‚Äôs Newton home. As an adult, when she returned every few months to care for her mother, she‚Äôd sleep in a guest room in the basement.

‚ÄúAnd so we did a radon test, and even the upstairs portion was over the limits \[of what‚Äôs considered safe\] for radon,‚Äù Rodgers said.

It‚Äôs not something she says folks talked about in Newton‚Äîbut could if local officials got involved.

‚ÄúI know that our family has always used the local ISU extension office ‚Ä¶ for help on, like, planting native grasses around our house and you know, crop rotation and set-aside land around the creek,‚Äù Rodgers said. ‚ÄúSo I feel like a lot of people go into those offices for information, and just informing people about their radon risk would be helpful.‚Äù

And state and federal officials could help too.

‚ÄúThey should care about people‚Äôs health,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so hard when \[you have\] what seems like a callous turning of your back to empathy and science and reason.‚Äù

# Leah Fisher, Waterloo

Leah Fisher of Waterloo is a four-year breast cancer survivor. But there‚Äôs no history of breast cancer in her family, which has led her to consider other possible causes.

‚ÄúI was raised on the east side of Waterloo, and I know we have a lot of manufacturing facilities,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt could have been environmental. So that worries me.‚Äù

At the top of her list is the former¬†[Chamberlain Manufacturing Company](https://thenewwaterloo.com/project/former-chamberlain-site/), which produced munitions beginning in World War II until it closed in the mid-1990s. It was designated a ‚Äúbrownfields‚Äù site and has gone through expensive cleanups from federal and local sources since the early 2000s.

The Environmental Protection Agency found the soil on that site¬†[contaminated with ‚Äúseveral metals and semi-volatile compounds,‚Äù](https://www.epa.gov/ia/former-chamberlain-manufacturing-site-waterloo-black-hawk-county-iowa-fact-sheet-july-2021)¬†including arsenic, lead, and cadmium. It also found groundwater contamination and ‚Äúvapor intrusion of trichloroethylene‚Äù in nearby homes.

[Arsenic](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/arsenic.html),¬†[cadmium](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/cadmium), and¬†[trichloroethylene](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/trichloroethylene)¬†are known cancer-causing chemicals.¬†[Lead is a probable carcinogen](https://www.lung.org/clean-air/indoor-air/indoor-air-pollutants/lead), according to the EPA.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot of minority Black women or Black people on the east side of town that are greatly impacted by cancer, whether it be breast cancer, colon, prostate, whatever,‚Äù Fisher said. ‚ÄúSo that scares me.‚Äù

Among Black residents getting cancer, Iowa ranks No. 2 in the nation and No. 3 for deaths,¬†[according to the Iowa Cancer Registry](https://shri.public-health.uiowa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Spotlight-Series_Cancer-in-Iowas-Black-Population_May-2024.pdf). Black Iowans have the highest rate of cancer and cancer deaths among all ethnicities, even accounting for income levels.

While breast cancer is the most common cancer for all Iowa women, Black women still die of it at greater rates.

Fisher received treatment at a different hospital from where she was diagnosed. She said people shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to ask for a second opinion, and be willing to go out of state if they‚Äôre not finding care they need here.

‚ÄúThank God I was blessed with a great support system,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut you do have to advocate for yourself and try to do your research.‚Äù

Her other advice for those dealing with a cancer diagnosis?

‚ÄúGive yourself grace,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúGive yourself patience. You can beat this. This is not the final step.‚Äù

# Karen Kinney, Waterloo

Karen Kinney of Waterloo was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer in September 2019, and went through surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation at University of Iowa Health Care.

But cancer patients know that‚Äôs not the end of the story: Kinney‚Äôs also dealt with years of follow-up appointments to make sure the cancer doesn‚Äôt return, which comes with its own minefields.

‚ÄúIn October of this year, I‚Äôll be five years cancer free,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI celebrate that, but I also deal with the aftermath of that financially, emotionally, psychologically‚Äîis it gonna come back?‚Äù

It‚Äôs something the word ‚Äúsurvivor‚Äù doesn‚Äôt quite capture.

‚ÄúEven though people like myself beat cancer, the aftermath‚Äîonce you‚Äôre cured or in remission‚Äîgoes on for a lifetime,‚Äù Kinney said. ‚ÄúYou are a totally different person from when you were diagnosed with cancer. Unless you‚Äôve been told you have cancer, you can‚Äôt really understand the physical and mental \[impacts\] of dealing with the cancer afterwards.‚Äù

So she was excited to join the cancer listening tour that came to Waterloo in August, put on by¬†[The Harkin Institute](https://harkininstitute.drake.edu/), the¬†[Iowa Environmental Council](https://www.iaenvironment.org/)¬†(IEC), and the¬†[Iowa Farmers Union](https://iowafarmersunion.org/)¬†(IFU).

‚ÄúI have concerns with Iowa and our water, our air quality, and I feel that these things are contributing to the cancer levels in Iowa,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôd like to have something done about that, and I‚Äôll be involved at whatever capacity I can to help with that, and to get the story out that we need to do something more about cancer in Iowa.‚Äù

Kinney isn‚Äôt alone; hundreds of Iowans have said the same at listening sessions held around the state this summer, said Kerri Johannsen, IEC‚Äôs senior director of policy and programs, who has attended several.

‚ÄúEveryone sees it. They see it all too closely in their lives,‚Äù Johannsen said. ‚ÄúThey go into Casey‚Äôs in town, and every day there‚Äôs a new cancer benefit ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs really hard to ignore.‚Äù

With some of the highest rates of cancer in the nation, Iowans are¬†[starting to think it‚Äôs more](https://artcullen.substack.com/p/iowans-are-waking-up)¬†than just factors everyone deals with, like genetics, consuming alcohol, or smoking tobacco.

‚ÄúPeople do not feel like they have good information about what environmental risk factors might be contributing to cancer rates, and they want to know,‚Äù Johannsen said.

And the ‚Äúdo something‚Äù part Kinney wants to help with? That‚Äôs ‚Äúthe next phase,‚Äù said Tommy Hexter, policy director with the IFU, who hosted the Waterloo listening session.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be up at the statehouse. We are going to have policy objectives that we hope will reverse the trends of cancer in Iowa,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are very confident that, with the Iowans around the state that are concerned about this issue, legislators will want to take action to make Iowa a better place.‚Äù",2,1757355379.0,dubuque,0,0.75,False

	‚Ä¢	Gate C = lifesaver on race day (no crowds vs B & D)
	‚Ä¢	Expect lines for EVERYTHING starting Saturday ‚Äî go against the crowd
	‚Ä¢	Live as close to the track as possible ‚Äî public transport & traffic can get messy

Overall reading all the horrors, I expected much worse experience but it turned out great.

Fun fact - my grandstand ticket allowed entrance to GA area also. You can walk from and into the track twice per day (so you can exit the track and then come back). My host told me that they are not actually checking that so that means that your ticket actually buys you at least 2 entries to the track - one for grandstand and one for GA. Dont know if the person actually used it, but I believe its doable. 
‚∏ª

What to Pack
	‚Ä¢	Wet wipes + backup TP You will need wet wipes not only for hands but also to clean your seat. It will constantly be in footmarks when you leave. Toilets aren‚Äôt always stocked.
	‚Ä¢	SPF ‚Äî there are dispensers but you don‚Äôt want to hunt for them
	‚Ä¢	Food & water are allowed inside, so take advantage. Water bottles are caped at 500 ml, but you can bring multiple.
	‚Ä¢	Powerbank <300g (they didn‚Äôt actually weigh mine, security was super chill)
	‚Ä¢	Some cash ‚Äî card terminals sometimes break
	‚Ä¢	Amex card = secret weapon ‚Äî most food/merch booths had Amex fast-track lines üòé
	‚Ä¢	Energy ‚Äî gels, coffee shots, something portable. The walking + heat + low-quality track food = energy crash risk. I basically had some snacks that got me through the day when the lines to vendors were too long.

I saw some people drink their ‚Äúwater‚Äù in very small sips and bottles were marked - so I can only assume it was liquor. Doable, nobody will actually check whats in the bottles. 

‚∏ª

Planning = Happiness

This honestly makes or breaks your weekend. Example: if nature calls mid-race, you‚Äôll spend 45+ minutes in line and maybe find no toilet paper. Plan meals, toilets, water refills, and gate entries in advance.

Day-by-Day Strategy

Friday
Chillest day: barely any lines. 
	‚Ä¢	Perfect to:
	‚Ä¢	Walk the whole track (I did ‚Äî saw every corner and checked sightlines). Definitely visit the old parabolica, stand on one of two tree stumps at the Ascari, get to the end of start/finish straight to really se the speed.
	‚Ä¢	Take photos, explore water points, merch, and event booths.
	‚Ä¢	Grab souvenirs while stock is good and lines short.
	‚Ä¢	Join fan events ‚Äî your only realistic chance without losing a whole day.

Saturday
	‚Ä¢	Treat it like a rehearsal for race day.
	‚Ä¢	Test your route in/out of the track, time it. Maybe I am overcomplicating things but this allowed me to know exactly how much time I will need to get to the track gate for the invasion.
	‚Ä¢	Check gate crowding (huge time-saver on Sunday).
	‚Ä¢	Measure how much food/water you‚Äôll actually need. On Sunday its almost impossible to get food without loosing 30-40 minutes. So if you can have food without you - I definitely recommend that option.
	‚Ä¢	Expect lines to appear midday onwards (20‚Äì50 people for toilets, food, water).

Sunday (Race Day)
	‚Ä¢	Crowd level: √ó10 compared to Friday.
	‚Ä¢	I arrived at 10:30 via Gate C ‚Üí basically empty vs mega-packed Gates B & D.
	‚Ä¢	GA ticket holders ‚Üí arrive EARLY (8‚Äì9am) with blanket/shade or you‚Äôll lose all the good spots.
	‚Ä¢	Tribune tickets ‚Üí you can still access GA zones if you want variety.
	‚Ä¢	Internet = 90s dial-up, so don‚Äôt count on streaming or live timing. I saw that some people were able to browse Instagram, I couldn‚Äôt even view timings.

Track Invasion & Walk
	‚Ä¢	Track invasion: official entry near Sector 8, but I saw gates open by 26A too. This is definitely worth it. This year race was kinda boring, so there was no point in waiting until the finish - I left early, 5 laps before the race end. 
	‚Ä¢	10‚Äì20 min after podium, drivers sometimes show up ‚Üí possible autographs if you‚Äôre right at the fence.
	‚Ä¢	Track walk: starts right after podium, but time-limited.
	‚Ä¢	Want a full lap? Start immediately. I think in about 90 minutes after the podium they closed the track. And its 5 km long, so it takes some time to do a full lap.
	‚Ä¢	People do find carbon bits & ‚Äúsouvenirs.‚Äù

‚∏ª

Viewing & Atmosphere
	‚Ä¢	Ask yourself: why am I here?
	‚Ä¢	Racing action ‚Üí First corner probably the best place to be.
	‚Ä¢	Atmosphere ‚Üí Tribune 26. Ferrari fans go nuts here. Bonus: always shaded.

My rule of thumb was to try and go opposite the crowd (better toilets, faster food, shorter water lines). And it worked most of the time.
	‚Ä¢	Even VIP areas get slammed with people ‚Äî don‚Äôt assume your ticket = comfort.

‚∏ª

Logistics & Accommodation
	‚Ä¢	Stay close to the track if you can.
	‚Ä¢	I found an Airbnb ~40 min walk away ‚Üí no transport stress, flexible in/out, no traffic.
	‚Ä¢	Bonus: walking opposite to Milan/Monza crowds meaning I could easily find places to eat.
	‚Ä¢	Public transport: looked jammed, but I‚Äôve read some posts saying it wasn‚Äôt terrible. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
	‚Ä¢	By car: expect heavy traffic. It looked bad around the track.

‚∏ª

Beyond the Track
	‚Ä¢	Evenings in Monza/Milan have tons of fan events, parties, and activities. Worth exploring if you have the energy left.
Merch from F1 Store - I believe was not worth it. The special Ferrari blue merch was more expensive than on the website. So why bother? There are quite a few different vendors with model cars, helmets, and other things - these were pretty cool. Ive left a lot of money there :)

I thought maybe it was because I took it without food the first time it happened, but that wasn‚Äôt the case in the other 2 times. 

I only have decaf coffee in the morning after I‚Äôve taken it, no other drugs or anything, maybe a my multivitamins (OLLIE women‚Äôs). 

But yeah, if anyone else has experienced this it would be reassuring to hear about! And maybe if there‚Äôs things you‚Äôve done to help make that not happen lol ",1,1757355323.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1nbvc4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nbvc4p/i_m37_am_feeling_defeated_in_my_marriage_with_f29/,I (M37) am feeling defeated in my marriage with (F29) and need some advice. Whats your best advice?,"So I just got back from a trip. My wife and I have been together for 9 years and officially we have been married for about 2 years. I had to go on a trip for a bachelor trip (my sister is getting married)  and my wife is going on a bachelorette trip next weekend, followed by a 3-day work event that she needs to be out of town for. Since I know she will be extremely sleep deprived I asked her to take it easy this weekend and to get some rest while I am gone because the following weekend is going to take a lot out of her. She proceeded to deep clean the entire house including scrubbing the walls, organizing everything, and cleaning the oven. She sacrificed her rest and sleep doing a deep clean on every part of our house. I have expressed my gratitude for that by sending her some money from my account ( please look up ""How Should Married People Manage Their Bank Accounts?"" by Steve Harvey on how we structure our finances for context). I sent her money so that I can personally cover dinner since I am out of town that weekend and kept reminding her that I can help clean when I get home and rest/sleep is the priority for this weekend). I have also thanked her and praised her multiple time in person and via text. 

The night/day of me traveling back home I had gone to bed at 10pm to wake up at 5am so I can drive 4 hours to make it to a 12pm flight. That night I fell asleep at about 10:20pm and woke up at 11:15pm with a full blown panic attack and anxiety like I haven't felt in my whole life. I proceeded to take my anxiety medication which subdued that panic attack. I tried to fall asleep again but kept tossing and turning and having mini panic attacks throughout my attempts to fall asleep till about 3am when I consulted chat GPT on what would be a more strategic move to keep trying to fall asleep or drive to the airport (4 hours away) and try and get a sleep pod to nap for about 3.5 hours before it was time to board. It recommended to drive to the airport at 3am to get there at 6am and check into the pods at 7am wake up y30 min before your flight so that your better rested. 

I then communicated this to my wife via text and she was against that idea from the start but I was already convinced to proceed. She wanted me to change flights and come back later in the evening so I could try and fall asleep, sleep in, and get home around 7/8pm. I looked and there were no availability so I proceeded with what Chat GPT suggested. On the way she kept texting me periodically asking for status reports and I kept texting her to get some rest and sleep bc she is going to need it for next weekend. I got to the airport at around 6:30am and got to the sleep pods at 7am only to discover that they are full. I had to wait till 8:15am for a pod to open up and take. I slept for like an hour before the noise from the airport and the pod staff kept waking me up. By the time I had to board my plane I had a total of 2 hours of broken anxiety filled sleep. I slept maybe another hour on the plane and landed at 2pm. 

The moment the wheels touched the ground I texted my wife (as she volunteered to pick me up from the airport) that I have landed. I then texted her that the pilot said that our gate will be available in about 30 seconds. Now while trying to exit the plan my wife texted me ""are you out of the plane yet?"" in which I was trying to walk down the aisle of the plan and go through the gate when I got a 'Hello?"" in which I responded ""just got out of the gate"" and she responded with ""ok tell me when your outside and what section you are in"" so I am walking to the escalators when I receive another text saying ""are you outside yet?"" in which one handed trying to text ""Im going down the escalator will be outside shortly"" in which she fired back instantly ""you are bad at communicating"" in which I ignored and brushed off. I got outside and told her exactly where I was only to respond with ""god your in the worst place there are cones blocking the lane to park and get you."" I texted ""oh im sorry here im moving in front of the cones."" She made it to my location shortly after. No getting out of the car and hug me, no ""hey babe"" I instantly put my bags in the car and the second my butt touches the seat she begins to criticize me on how much I suck at communication which I am so sleep deprived at this moment I calmly say ""i can't to this with you right now"" and remained silent disassociating with everything she was yelling to me about till I couldn't handle it and yelled back. I ignored her for the rest of the car ride. During the silence I kept remembering seeing all the other couples and families and friends who got picked up with smiles and hugs and all the warmest welcomes and it got me super depressed that all I get is being yelled at. 

We proceeded to get home in which I immediately unpack not daring to disrespect her cleaning, and noticed she hasn't unpacked from a trip that she took about a month ago so I decided to help unpack her stuff too when she all the sudden said ""i left it unpacked for a reason so I don't have to repack for this coming weekend"" in a very hostile tone. After some silence we proceed to get into a very heated argument to the point I repacked and was heading to a hotel. Midway to a hotel she called and said ""come home and lets work things out"" I agreed and we ended up working things out for the most part but still being very distant to me. I took a sleeping pill last night to help knock me out and get me some quality sleep. She woke me up several times in the night telling me to stop snoring. Mind you she snores too and even louder than I do. She even claimed she tried sleeping on the couch until me coughing kept her up even more. This morning she tried getting in the bed and said I gave her little to no space to sleep in so I got up and moved to the couch and knocked out again until she woke me up saying ""your in my spot to work can you go to the bed"" (She works from home sometimes). Noticing the time I wake up and force myself to shower and get to work myself in our community/HOA offices that are in the community facilities (where the pool is and everything I work from home full time). I proceeded to make some coffee when she said that the noise I was making was annoying and if I could please stop. I stopped and thought I could just get something from the vending machines in the community area. When I vocalized that I was leaving and I love her she proceeds to yell and criticizes me on how I kept her up all night and how I am a problem and how my actions have affected her significantly on how much rest she is not getting all because of me, and that she has 2 trips back to back next weekend and next week and she needs all the rest she can. I proceed to leave until she said ""so your not making coffee"" in which I reminded her that my noise and coughing was disturbing her and I am choosing not to make it, her response is 'just make it' so i did and told her again ""good bye I love you"" and left with coffee in my hand. 

Now the real thing here is I need some direction on how to navigate this because me returning home doesn't feel like home anymore and there seems to be no love, no signs of missing me, no cuddling last night, just pure coldness and bitterness ever since I landed.
