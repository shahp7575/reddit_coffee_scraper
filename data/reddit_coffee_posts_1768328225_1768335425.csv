1qc1z98,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1qc1z98/practicing_being_home_alone/,Practicing being home alone,"We have a 15 wk mini dachshund. He’s crate trained and takes all naps in there as well as sleeping there at night. We’re pretty religious about 1 hour up 2 down and sleep and potty training is going great. 

The main issue is that we haven’t practiced leaving him home alone *awake* much. I’ve done 15 min or so runs to grab coffee with him in his pen, which he can somewhat tolerate but does get pretty hyped up (not full blown panic but pulling blankets from his crate and such) unless engaged with an enrichment feeder the whole time. 

I have however put him in his crate and left for two hours while he naps, but aside from “I can fall asleep with no one home”, given that he’s sleeping for those two hours it doesn’t seem to be training him much.

I want to make sure we’re on the right path to avoiding separation anxiety and truly being able to leave him home alone, but it feels like we’re not making progress on the pen. 

Does the nap-time crate practice count towards this or do I need to push harder on leaving him in the pen? Any other tips?

1qc1yzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qc1yzy/grinder_problems_eureka_mingon/,Grinder problems [Eureka Mingon],"Hi, will try to do this short.

Me and my GF have a Eureka mingon grinder, had it for a year and worked like a charm.

Around 1-2 months ago we started having problems with espresso extracting too quickly. We kept trying to grind finer, but it couldn't be fine enough. We sent our grinder to the supplier (warran), and they say the grinder doesn't have and errors.

Fyi, our espresso machine is a rocket and had service a few weeks ago with no problems.

Now we're sat back wondering what's wrong (we're still waiting to receive our grinder back and try again). We thought we could see minor height changes/skewness in our blurts, but now we simply don't know what's wrong, besides our coffee beans won't grind fine enough...

Additionally, which also makes it weird, we have tried other beans, where some could run just fine, and others had the same problem. The beans we use are roasted within 14 days, by a large firm that does daily quality tests etc. And it has been the problem for 3 different bags of beans...

Any thoughts at all?!?!? We're starting to loosr our sanity",1,1768335232.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
1qc1yv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1qc1yv0/am_i_f27being_overly_sensitive_about_a_former/,Am I ‘F-27’being overly sensitive about a former co-worker (F) of my fiancé ‘FtM-25’ wanting to be friends with him now that they don’t work together?,"I may be overly sensitive about a new situation that has come up with my fiancé given my relationship history. My ex fiancé cheated on me several times, all with new “friends” of the opposite gender that I never met and he met through work. I trust my fiancé and do not think he would cheat on me, but I worry more about the intentions of the former co-worker. Also, I don’t think she knows he is FtM and he passes really well in case that changes the interpretation of the situation.

To provide some more information, my fiancé worked with this former co-worker for \~4 months and they only interacted when they worked together (which was once a week for a couple hours teaching a lab). My fiancé talks about me endlessly to people, so she definitely knows about me and that he is engaged. She follows him on social media where he has posted about our engagement and excitement to get married several times (she hasn’t liked any of those posts so I’m not sure she has seen them). Recently, she sent him a text saying she would like to stay friends now that they don’t work together and said it would be nice to get coffee with him. This raised some red flags for me since to me it is a bit odd to be asking an engaged man to coffee without an invite to their partner. He hasn’t responded to the message and sent me a message asking how I felt about it immediately since he knows I am this is something I am more sensitive to due to my past.

Later that night we talked about it in more detail. He told me he thinks she just wants to grab coffee where they work since she doesn’t have a car. I brought up that he could invite her to join in with an already existing coffee social event that he attends since it would be with a large group of people along with people we are both already friends with. He said that would work great. I also offered to get coffee with the two of them, but he said he isn’t interested in meeting up with her outside of work (i.e. he would only really be interested in grabbing coffee during a lunch break  where they work etc.) since he’s not willing to take time from our other activities. He did ask how he could approach making new friends within the boundaries of what I find comfortable. I said that it would be more comfortable to me if he wanted someone to become a new closer friend  (or an outside of work friend) it would be nice if we could do that together since I would do the same. I told him I personally am not interested in being friends with people that don’t like him and aren’t interested in spending time with him too. He said this was fine, but I just worry that maybe I’m off my rocker and am being way too sensitive. 

I don’t want to be a “controlling” wife. I just feel like it crosses some boundaries to be hanging out with someone of the opposite gender that I have never met over and over again, especially when they have shown no interest in getting to know or including me. I also feel like there is a potential she may have different intentions than he is interpreting. I brought this up to him and he said he just assumes people are reasonable and understand that he is engaged and uninterested. In my experience, this doesn’t always stop people and it’s best to avoid putting yourself in these situation, which I explained to him. So, am I being too sensitive about this?",1,1768335223.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Customers expect faster service, seamless payments, delivery options, and smooth digital experiences. Meanwhile, owners need real-time data, tighter cost control, and technology that performs reliably during the busiest rush hours.

* Online and QR ordering: do you need built-in online ordering?

* Budget and payment model: monthly subscription vs. pay-per-transaction.

The right POS should make operations faster, reduce errors, and adapt to your growth — not hold it back.

1qc1y6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/IntrovertDating/comments/1qc1y6p/19f_introvert_looking_for_someone_who_feels_at/,19F introvert looking for someone who feels at home in the quiet,"Hello. I'm a 19-year-old girl and a thorough introvert. Large groups and noisy places tire me out very quickly, small talk feels awkward and empty, and I recharge best when I have time to myself or with just one person I feel truly safe around. I've grown comfortable with this part of my personality over time, but lately I've started wishing for someone who shares the same quiet wavelength. Someone I can connect with gradually, without any pressure to be constantly social, energetic, or always filling every moment with words or activity.

I'm currently in my first year of college, keeping things low-key outside of classes. I spend most of my free time reading fantasy novels that let me disappear into completely different worlds, watching slower-paced movies or series that focus on atmosphere and character development, listening to calm music like lo-fi beats, ambient sounds, or soft indie while I sit with a notebook and write whatever thoughts come to mind or just doodle. I enjoy making tea or coffee the way I like it best, taking long walks when the streets are empty or peaceful, and simply letting hours pass while my mind wanders freely. Crowded events, loud environments, and back-to-back plans make me feel overwhelmed almost immediately. I feel most at peace when everything is slow, calm, and unhurried.

I'm not searching for someone who wants to change how I am or pull me into a more extroverted version of life. What I'm hoping to find is another introvert who understands it without needing much explanation. Someone comfortable with silences that don't feel uncomfortable, who prefers one deep conversation over many light ones, who would enjoy simple shared moments like reading quietly in the same space, exchanging book or music recommendations, watching something thoughtful together, or talking about life, feelings, or random ideas when the timing feels natural. I think two introverts can build something very gentle, respectful, and meaningful because we both value personal space and choose closeness intentionally.

I'd like to hear from guys around 18 to 23 who also identify as introverted. You don't have to be extremely shy or have trouble talking, just someone who naturally recharges in solitude, thinks things through, and prefers thoughtful, low-energy connection over constant stimulation or frequent plans. Distance is completely fine with me if the conversation feels genuine and worth keeping up.

If this sounds like it could describe you, please feel free to message me whenever you're ready. Maybe share a little about yourself, like what you enjoy doing when you're alone, a book or song that's been on your mind lately, or what your idea of a perfect quiet evening would look like. There's no pressure to reply quickly or be very talkative from the beginning. We can start small, take things as slow as we both need, and see if it feels right naturally. I'm just hoping to find one person who makes the quiet feel a little less lonely and a little more shared. Thank you for reading this.",1,1768335182.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False

My testosterone took a dive for the worst this morning. Not only did I wake up extremely exhausted off 7 hours (which is better than usual), I was also an ice cube in my onesie 🥶

My mood wasn’t the greatest to either with but I tried to make the best of the morning while I got the kid ready for school. My nips are really hurting so no wearing my binder in public today, again.

And then it hit me. While making a quick cup of coffee before taking my kid to school I suddenly felt an overwhelming amount of anxiety & depression hit me so hard I fell to the floor. I tried to get calm before the kid heard me but the harder I tried to hold the tears the deeper the feelings and the heavier the chest. Then it happened, I let out a cry (as tame as I could) and so began the sobbing. 

There I was on the floor, cold, emotional, tired & sore. My beautiful autistic child came to join me on the floor with the most sincere concern in his eyes and says. “It’s all going to be okay, you’ll see”, while holding me in what was the best hug I’ve ever had. I hardly even noticed the sharp nip pains, it just felt good to be in my son’s embrace. 

I’m sitting here sipping my coffee & attempting to do some writing while keeping myself as comfortable as possible. If I’m like this now what’s HRT gonna be like?

Such an emotional day, but I’ll keep going for as long as you need.. just don’t be so intense all the time, plz.

1qc1udx,https://www.reddit.com/r/parentsofmultiples/comments/1qc1udx/the_only_way_i_survive_grocery_runs_solo_with/,The only way I survive grocery runs solo with twins,"Seven months ago, I was completely overwhelmed. Having seven-month-old twins is a joy, but the logistics were a nightmare, especially with my husband traveling for work almost every week. I spent weeks worrying about how I’d ever manage a grocery run or basic errands by myself without a total meltdown. After obsessing over different specs, we finally decided on this double stroller to help me handle mom duty on my own.  
After seven months of daily use, the biggest win has definitely been the price. As much as I love my twins, they are equally expensive. And since we have to buy two of everything, this twin stroller (momcozy ) felt like a great middle ground. It has the bassinet options I wanted and feels high-quality without being way overpriced. The storage basket is a lifesaver. Being able to fit a week’s worth of groceries under the babies is the only way I actually get errands done when I’m on my own.  
It’s also surprisingly capable when we leave the pavement. I’ve taken it through grass at the park and over those annoying cracked sidewalks in our neighborhood, and it doesn't rattle or get stuck. The suspension is smooth enough that I can steer both kids with one hand while keeping a much-needed coffee in the other. It feels grounded, which is a relief when you're pushing quite a bit of weight.  
That said, it isn't perfect. The biggest downside is the weight; lifting it into the back of my SUV is a serious workout, which might be tough if you're petite or still recovering from birth. It’s also quite bulky and takes up more than half of my trunk space. But for me, the trade-off is worth it for the durability. I looked at other brands, but they didn't feel like they could handle the weight of two growing kids for the long haul. Once I actually tried this one out, the build quality convinced me. It’s reliable and made me feel like I can actually handle things when I’m parenting solo.

Starting: 220 lbs, February 2024

Now: 180 lbs, August 2024



Didn't count calories.

Didn't go to gym.

Didn't follow any diet plan.



What I did instead:



1. Walking 10K steps daily (non-negotiable)

Didn't matter when or how.

Split it up throughout day.

Park far away. Take stairs. Walk while on calls.

Used free pedometer app.



2. No food after 7 PM (simple rule)

Not intermittent fasting.

Just stop eating at 7.

Drink water if hungry.

Sleep earlier = less snacking.



3. One less thing (gradual)

Week 1: Cut soda

Week 2: Cut chips

Week 3: Cut candy

Week 4: Cut fast food



Didn't replace with ""healthy"" alternatives.

Just eliminated one category at a time.



4. Same breakfast every day

Oatmeal + banana + coffee.

Zero decisions in morning.

Auto-pilot = consistency.



5. Accountability via daily photo

Took same photo every morning.

Same spot. Same mirror. Same time.

Didn't share with anyone.

Just for me to see progress.



Results:

Month 1: -6 lbs

Month 2: -8 lbs

Month 3: -7 lbs

Month 4: -6 lbs

Month 5: -7 lbs

Month 6: -6 lbs



Not fast. But consistent.



Why this worked:



\- Simple rules anyone can follow

\- No gym membership needed

\- No expensive food

\- No app subscriptions

\- Can't fail if rules are simple



Still doing it.

Goal: 170 lbs by December.



Anyone else lose weight with simple systems like this?",3,1768334853.0,getdisciplined,1,1.0,False

At this prefect thing we were simply making coffees and teas for some of the teachers and people handed them out. Me and my friends were doing mainly all the work, me and another friend making the actually drinks, and the other two were handing them out. We were all having a really good time until bob started being really demanding. He was ordering us about to make him a drink and being completely careless to the point where everyone was getting sick of him. Him and Susie were coming  in at different times talking bad about some of my friends to my face. They pretty much just sat down for majority of the thing anyway. Bob was on his way out and my friend was in his way, and he said “move b\*\*\*\*”. We were obviously confused, like who was he to just call her a b\*\*\*\*, and so we asked them about it. Susie claimed that when bob called her a b\*\*\*\* it was merely a TikTok trend (my friend doesn’t have TikTok) and we kind of looked at each other like hmm.. and then susie said to bob “I need a word with you”. 

Me and my friends proceeded to talk about them. Nothing really too bad from what I can recall, just things like “they’re really annoying” or maybe even “why is he bossing you around like that” which at the time seemed completely appropriate because my friend was obviously upset at the previous name-calling and perhaps needed some reassurance that she wasn’t the only one who thought they were rude. 

I thought nothing of it until we walked out of the doors to see Susie shouting and my friend who bob called a b\*\*\*\*. They had voice recorded the entire thing. Susie was saying things like “im gonna listen to the rest of this and if anyone else is involved im gonna have to have a word with yous” and was completely losing it. I quickly ran out of there because i wasn’t sure what was going on at the time and i must admit, i was a bit nervous.

Do you guys think we deserved what we got? Because I just think it was crazy to voice record the thing (safeguarding issue??) and then the hypocrisy because they were talking about my friends first. Anyway, a teachers been told by my friend and the voice recording is getting deleted so hopefully all will be well tomorrow 🤞",2,1768334783.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Looking at the 3 million dollars in my account I remember myself ten years ago working late into the night all those endless project meetings coffee at 3 AM weekends spent in the office every bit of effort now feels completely worth it

My financial setup is pretty straightforward

Long term portfolio 1.5 million mostly in low cost global index ETFs averaging about 7 annual return thats my growth engine for the future

Bank CDs and Treasury bonds 1 million this is my safety net right now its spread across solid banks and government bonds with an average interest rate around 42

Yep that conservative 1 million gives me about 3500 a month in interest and my monthly spending stays under 3000

I dont chase designer brands dont dream of luxury cars just enjoy good food now and then and travel

Now my mornings arent torn apart by an alarm I can spend two hours slowly reading sit on a park bench in the afternoon and watch people walk by pick up the piano again after years walk into empty museums on a weekday make a cup of tea when the sunlight is just right

Freedom tastes sweeter than I ever imagined

Sometimes friends ask me dont you get bored not working I smile and say Im only just starting to work now this work is life itself

Thank you to my 25 year old self who worked so hard thank you for every choice that was rational not impulsive long term not short sighted The reward isnt a luxurious life but the most precious thing the ownership of my own time

1qc1pn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1qc1pn5/random_thoughts_and_tips_for_international_travel/,Random thoughts and tips for international travel.,"I've travelled all over the world, spanning about 70 countries. For people who want to travel to more places and experience more cultures, maybe some of this might be helpful. And please, people should feel free to add:

1. On long haul flights, it's super helpful to pack a small bag of things that you're likely to want at your seat. This will maximize your legroom and make it easy to grab certain items such as a phone charger, glasses, snacks, iPad, eye mask, etc.

2. If you feel uncomfortable in a foreign country, ask yourself ""is it dangerous or is it unfamiliar?"" So often, we feel a bit scared because we're in a new, unfamiliar area even though it's pretty safe. And this is natural; we feel much more comfortable in familiar places. For instance, I was recently walking through a rougher looking area of Eastern Europe (e.g., brutalist buildings etc) which might seem a bit dodgy in the USA. But rather than assuming it was dangerous, I noticed that mothers were pushing baby strollers and kids were happy and playing. It was safe. Asking this question won't necessarily comfort you immediately but over time, you'll become skillful at determining whether a place is safe or not. And most of the time, it's safe. 

3. What you consider to be polite or friendly can actually vary by country and culture. For example, Americans tend to find people who engage in small talk to be really friendly; it's part of our culture (speaking as an American) to banter with strangers. Lots of places, though, detest small talk but emphasize making actual, meaningful relationships (so they're very confused when Americans say ""let's get coffee"" and then we don't plan a coffee date). The point is that people aren't necessarily acting rude or unfriendly, but their understanding of politeness and warmth might be different than yours.

4. You'll have more fun, and people will like you more, if you try to blend in. If you're an early eater, you'll struggle to find dinner at 6pm in Spain; it's worth trying to adopt the local custom of eating late. If you're in a place where people don't tend to put ice in drinks, try to enjoy a drink without ice--and please, please, please, don't complain about the country's lack of ice. Or if you're somewhere that adheres to a more flexible view of time such as India, understand that things might not start the moment you expect them to start.

5. The language barrier is, in reality, such a small barrier. If you want to buy something, and someone wants to sell it to you, you'll figure it out every time. 

6. Also about languages, learn a few words and phrases--people will REALLY appreciate it. Whether it's speaking some french in France or Swahili in Kenya, it's incredible how much people will enjoy your efforts. Just saying, ""hi, how are you? .... I'm good"" can work wonders.

7. For Americans, try to be aware of how loud you're being. It's probably the primary complaint about Americans, especially in places where people tend to be quiet and reserved. In other words, try to match the energy of where you are.

8.If a country haggles, then haggle. It's part of the culture and customs. 

9. A long layover can be a great way to see a place. Sometimes layovers can last 24 hours or more. If so, check your big luggage on the airplane and then pack a backpack of some clothes and toiletries. This way you can easily run around all day and then clean up in the evening. I was even able to see Amsterdam with a 5 or 6 hour layover. So whenever I have a layover in a city I'd like to see, I try to see if a long layover is available. 

10. Roll with the punches. 

Anything else?

1qc1nm2,https://i.redd.it/t4gajnsv66dg1.png,"📘 How to Set a Budget in the Money Master Personal Finance Spreadsheet (Multi‑Account, Multi‑Year, Month‑by‑Month)","If you’re new to **Money Master**, this guide walks you through the budget setting process from start to finish. Your budget is **multi‑account**, **multi‑year**, and may be **profiled month‑by‑month with varying amounts**, providing you with a flexible and realistic financial plan, that adapts to your life.

🏦 **1. Select Account for Your Budget Item**

Start by choosing which account the budget item belongs to from the dropdown:

* Bank Account 1–15
* Liability 1–15
* Asset 1–15
* Investment 1–15

👉 **Most users will only budget for Income and Expense items**, because **only these appear in the Income & Expenditure Report**.

Once you select an account, **Money Master automatically looks up the account name from the Setup screen**.

🗂️ **2. Choose Group → Class → Category → Sub‑Category**

This structure keeps your budget organised and your reporting accurate.

You’ll select from the dropdown menus:

* **Group** (Income, Expense, Transfers, etc.)
* **Class** (Needs, Wants)
* **Category** (Clothes, Food & Drink, Home, Insurance, etc.)
* **Sub‑Category** (Children's Clothes, Eating Out, Mortgage, Car Insurance, Salary etc).

This hierarchy powers the dashboard insights and helps you understand your spending patterns.

📅 **3. Choose the Budget Year**

Money Master supports **multi‑year budgeting**, so you can plan:

* The current year
* Next year
* Future years
* Tax‑year‑aligned budgets
* Long‑term financial goals

Just select the year you’re budgeting for - everything stays neatly separated and easy to track.

📆 **4. Profile Your Budget Month‑by‑Month**

Every budget item can be shaped to match real life.

You can:

* Enter the same amount for all 12 months
* Vary amounts month‑by‑month
* Add seasonal changes
* Set irregular income
* Add one‑off expenses
* Reflect lifestyle or bill changes throughout the year

This month‑by‑month profiling makes your budget realistic instead of rigid.

📊 **5. Everything Is Consolidated Automatically (Wide Budget → Long Actuals)**

Money Master handles the data structure behind the scenes so you don’t have to.

* **Your budget is stored in wide format** (12 months across the row).
* **Your actual transactions are stored in long format** (one row per transaction).

Even though the formats differ, **the Income & Expenditure Report consolidates everything efficiently**.

It aligns each budgeted month with the matching actuals across all accounts and presents a clear comparison of:

* Budgeted income vs actual income
* Budgeted expenses vs actual expenses
* Surplus or deficit
* Category‑level insights

You get a unified, accurate view of your finances without reshaping or transforming anything manually.

💬 **How Do You Build Your Budget?**

Do you keep things simple, or do you profile each month differently?

I fully understand fruits and veggies are best but it's just been a struggle to eat enough of anything, in general so I'm being realistic and trying to cover my bases.

However this morning my husband couldn't close our bathroom medicine cabinet because my supplement bottles kept falling out, so I'm realizing I probably be more intentional with my routine.

After much research I'm leaning towards ""Boostie Daily"" which has ""more"" in it than anything else I can find in 2 capsules. It looks like I can replace the following 6 products in my current regimen with it:  
1\. Vitamin D3+K2

2.  B complex
    

3.  Biotin + silicon + copper for hair, skin, nails
    

4.  ashwaganda for anxiety
    

5.  L-theanine for focus (and i like it with my coffee)
    

6.  multivitamin

It's just how it is. I'm currently doing university (both in person and online classes) so I'm not always there but I am there sometimes because my job is online as well as still getting other education, it's similar for him as well. We are definitely very fortunate and privileged and i am aware this is a first world problem but i do tend to take big things and make them trivial so who knows. My brother and I both love coffee and bond over it quite often. I had bought a bag of not even ""very premium expensive coffee"" whatever that is, just a large bag of coffee and I had put it in the cupboard and you know I noticed a few days ago it was almost empty and he was drinking a lot. I of course wanting to save some for myself just took it back and put it in my room. He was upset over this and I told him it was mine and he could always buy his own. He stated I was being selish and greedy. Later on, he comes out and takes the air fryer into his room, telling me that he bought it with his own money. Now it is a double basket air fryer that he did buy for the both of us, and to be fair an air fryer doesn't run out of beans but i get it he was upset and i already went ahead and ordered a toaster oven type for myself i prefer those anyway and it is his money and i do respect that so i wasn't gonna argue over that and i just decided to get a new one with my own money. It just seemed really rude and done to spite me but then i don't know maybe I'm in the wrong and a terrible brother for not telling him, maybe he's just being petty or maybe ESH?

Spence and Emily come inside Hastings house. Spencer says how her brain feels shut down and can't understand algebra. She used to love it cause it isn't real and would isolate the x factor. Now she feels like the x factor. That's so sad. She feels isolated, alone and blamed. That's awful. Veronica tells her they served a search warrant for the house. She goes and see them searching her room. It's so sad. Ian passes by and they look at each other. Is he happy they don't search him? Because of dating Ali and Spence. But no, they don't arrest him…

Montgomery house, Em called Aria to tell her about the search warrant, she sees Byron standing distracted. What happened? He says Ella is coming for coffee but Aria got it already happened and was here for the night. He said you can't sneak into your own house. That's actually a pretty cool information. I love that statement, Aria agrees. Ella comes and then Mike and tell him the things might change back. They will discuss it as a family.

Marin house. Han tells Caleb about the warrant. Han goes to put his breakfast on his bag but finds a owl thingie. She tells and shows the liars minus Spencer the photo. She says it's symbolic cause they heard owls in the woods together. That's so cute!

Paige and Sean talk to each other and laughing, Em is jealous i guess? Han tells her it's okay and Sean is a great guy. She doesn't care about you right now though. Han is so happy, she deserves it so much. Spence comes, they took some stuff to shook her up. Veronica wants her home. Are you kidding? Can't you see how she doesn't want to be there? Aria sends a message about Ezra's eyes. It got sent to Ella.

Sean goes to Em and asks about Paige, if she is seeing someone cause he likes her. She says she isn't her friend and Han wants him to be happy. He was surprised by this.

Ella asks Aria how long she knows about them and she says she caught the feelings. Yeah, totally not went after you like a spy. She tells her based on her experience to always check before you press send, she shows the message. Aria is so shocked my poor baby, and says it was a mistake. Ella is happy she can think about boys through all that. Amazing reaction. She asks her who is it and what color are the eyes to start search who it is. Awesome idea! 😂 Aria tells her it's private and Ella deletes it.

Aria hides stuff connected to Ezra but decides to leave the book he signed her. Why don't hide it darling? It's risky!
Spence deletes emails. Everyone is scared right now. Toby comes to her and tells her there is a cop car across her house. The poor boy is so used to it, know everything about it. He tells her to go coffee to the cops so they will know she knows they are there and isn't afraid of them. I love him. She is afraid. She thinks the car he saw before Ali died, could be Ian's. She tells him he should be away of her and he says they are in similar situation. “Who else are we going to hang out with?” That's so true, I love him so much.

Em goes and tells Paige she saw her talking to Sean. Paige said they will go out and Em is jealous. Em darling one day you don't know, the other don't want to hide and now you are upset she will go on a date with someone else. Try to decide.

Ella and Byron walk. She tells him Aria knew about them and tells him about the message. It's a really true reaction he doesn't trust the rest of the world. Ella is true about they shouldn't question her to get the answers if she doesn't want to answer.

Aria gives Em stuff related to Ezra. She has keeped so cute stuff about them!! I love them!! They hear Caleb talking to the phone telling they both did a mistake, he can't do it tonight, it's different now, he doesn't think she is who the person thinks she is. Because he's living in her house and the person keeps calling and it's got to stop. He's talking about Hanna! He ends the call and leaves. They hide so he doesn't notice them.

They tell Hanna what they heard. She doesn't believe them. They think she was talking to another girl. I didn't heard another voice. How did you understand that? How they knew they have history? Han is getting defensive. Spence is there. She isn't home today?

They see Jenna walking with the owl as a necklace songs her neck. They are silent. So it was for her! Was he talking to her? I guess. Caleb isn't picking up and Han sends him a text. Spence says it's either exactly what it looks like our something worse. So the first is dating both? The second what is it? Being a murderer? Being A? Em goes to go to the bathroom and hears Paige talking to a girl and how she scored because it's Sean. Em leaves. The fact that because of that she couldn't go to the bathroom…

Spence passes by and sees Jenna using the owl as an USB, cause that's what it is. She tells it to the liars. And they think Caleb is A. Han doesn't believe them. She puts a message in his locker to call her, she will be home. She checks if he's password on the locker is 214. It opened. Why would he have the room Jenna was or A acted like Jenna was or Jenna was and then A went there?!

Caleb and Hanna. He tells her he did it for money, Jenna learned he was a hacker and asked about her phone. And as Han said, the phone he couldn't crack… Jenna learned he did some work on Em's phone and told him to make himself available to Han and listen. How is that connected?! Then she asked questions he didn't liked and by then probably he liked Hanna. He gave her his locker combination to give him the flash drive. She thinks he have her the log off Han's cell phone but it isn't. Hanna is upset and she's right for that. Why she had to ask Caleb for that for him to talk to her? He leaves. So the 214 Jenna had was the locker combination.

Spence and Toby. He asks sorry cause it's part of what happened to Ali and to all them. She says they happened to him. She asks him how it is to run away. When she was 7, she and Melissa were fighting and the parents took Melissa's side, so she run away and watched a movie. Then she came back, they didn't noticed she was gone. This is the whole life of Spencer's situation with her parents. He tells her to call him if she wants to run away again. That's so cute!

Byron goes to Aria's room, he looks the book Ezra signed. I told you! Ella tells him they shouldn't spy, once again they are arguing cause they have difference on how they want to parent their kids. At least he didn't saw it was signed.

Paige and Em at school, Han probably didn't talked to them, Em is jealous of Paige and Sean. Veronica thinks the search warrant will be thrown out. How she dating Ian made her at the top of the list? Shouldn't they care about the adult that may interfered with both of them?! Veronica is supportive. That's cute.

Han came to school, she was walking. Oh my poor baby going from honeymoon to the bottom of the sea of betrayal. That's so sad. Jenna comes in the bathroom. Han goes to talk to her, she slapped her and her glasses fell, Han picked them up and gave them to her. Jenna deserved it actually. She tells her it's Hanna, in case she couldn't guess. That's so awesome!

Mike blames Aria for their parents fighting. She calms him down. Whatever happens Aria doesn't fault for the way their parents are handling it.
Emily's room. Paige messaged Em if she's busy. I guess Paige isn't!

Hastings house. Ian says he was worried about Spence. Right, like we would believe that. He thought she would run away but would understand if she did. She says it would be great if she ran away cause she would definitely be guilty. He tells her to accept the help that is offered whenever it's coming from cause when they will arrest her it will be too late. Do you think it's a matter of time?! He's awful.

Paige comes in Em's room. She always wanted the window seat. Same!! She says the date went well and kissed her goodnight. She felt like it wasn't her. Em tells her to be honest with him and she's right. Paige says Em's fearless but Paige is afraid. Em supports her. They end up kissing.
Marin house. Han cries, Ashley goes to tell Han that the guest room is empty, she tells her he left.

Veronica comes to asleep Spencer, that woke up and tells her they found threads in the bracelet Ali gave them, like the one found in Toby's sweater. She asks her if she had that sweater. She obviously denies. Why would she take a sweater from a person she killed?! You leave that there. What are these bracelets made of?! A breaks a heart that has written Hanna on it, puts glue and a note to try put it back together. Objectively it's a nice idea but so heartbreaking and insensitive for Hanna.

**Question:**

_I’m been having the worst flare for months and it’s still a while till I see a derm. I’ve stopped coffee and processed sugars for close to two months now, stopped gluten and dairy for 3 weeks, am only using vanicream facewash to wash hands sparingly, using gloves to wash dishes and hair/body in shower, I am just miserable. I’ve tried three different steroid creams, econazole (anti-fungal), terbinafine (saw insane improvement but after 1 week and still applying it I have flared again. This time instead of clear bubbles they look white. I’ve been trying to eat super clean and Whole Foods only, I take vitamin d supplements. Does anyone have triggers that are solely stress based? Or did anyone randomly develop a sensitivity to gluten? I am not eating it in excess but have a slice of sourdough toast maybe every other day. Any help or things that worked for you are appreciated! 🥹_

**Answer:**

Hey there, I'm really sorry to hear about your flare-up. That sounds really rough. Sometimes, symptoms that don't respond well to physical treatments might have a psychosomatic element. This means the symptoms could be triggered by unresolved emotional conflicts. It doesn’t mean the symptoms aren't real—they are just playing out in a unique way.

Stress and unresolved emotions can sometimes manifest physically. Your body might be reacting to something emotional in an attempt to cope with the stress. It's like your mind is trying to protect you from something it's not ready to face.

Some possibilities could be stress from work or relationships, feeling overwhelmed by a life change, or even something from the past that's bubbling up. Here are some questions you might reflect on:

1. Has there been a significant stressor in your life recently?

2. Are there any unresolved conflicts or worries you're dealing with?

3. How do you usually process stress or emotional upset?

4. Is there something in your life that you might be avoiding or putting off?

5. Have you noticed any patterns in when these symptoms flare up?

I hope this offers a different perspective and maybe even some relief. Feel free to ask me anything else if you need.",1,1768334074.0,mytorial,0,1.0,False

1qc1few,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qc1few,"My first Camino: overpacked, underprepared, but carried by strangers","I walked the Camino some months ago and only a little later have I felt ready to write about it. I originally shared this reflection elsewhere, but I thought it might resonate here as well — especially for first-timers who are still figuring things out.

For a while I have been flirting with the idea of doing an El Camino in Spain, however in my head I figured I would do it a bit less spontaneously, and more prepared, read about others’ experiences, explore a selection of gear I might need, etc, rather than how I now had the chance. It happened so that I found myself with a lot of free time in October, that was not planned originally, so I bought my bus tickets to Vigo, signed myself off from everything for the following two weeks, and got on my way. Yes, I bought bus tickets, because the idea was so last minute, that it would’ve cost double – if not triple – with a plane. With buses, it took some 45-ish hours to arrive to Vigo. From buying the tickets to getting on the way to the bus station I had about 8 hours. This was the amount of time I had to spend on preparing my gears, planning my route day by day and figuring out how my meals on the trip would be solved. At this point I had the intention to spend my nights out, sleep under the stars in my hammock, make my little morning coffee on my camping stove, maybe some snacks for breakfast, then continue wherever the road takes me. But as we all know – even “the best laid schemes of mice and men go oft awry” – let alone the never laid ones.

Pretty soon after getting on the bus, I had to realize I forgot to pack a water bottle for hydration not only on the bus trip, but later on the hike as well, so after arriving to Vigo I visited a gear shop, scratching my head thinking I might have packed a tad bit too heavy… And if that’s your initial thought lifting your backpack after a two-day-long bus trip, then you most probably have, as the upcoming days are not gonna be any easier. So I sat down for a beer, that always helps thinking. In between two sips, I made my plan B – to go find albergues anyway if I feel it too hard, maybe just every other night, then I would have a little of this and a little of that, too… The time was nearing eight in the evening, when I finally got on the road, having decided to go with my full bag, and spend the nights in my hammock – stick with the original ‘plan’. The direction from here is South-East, cca 30 km until Tui, where my official Camino would start – quite the warming-up.

As I arrived to Tui, I already felt my backpack was way too heavy, but all I needed to keep carrying it, was to be just a little stronger. And that’s what kept me going, whenever I felt weak, I just needed to be a little bit stronger. In the afternoon I decided to visit an albergue. ‘I’d just take a shower, then go forward’ I said to the receptionist, and right after the shower, I took a nap, too… But then I really moved on. I think this day was the hardest, and this was the day I felt the most lost on this journey. I was trying to smoothen my steps, to spare my knees as much as I could – considering them carrying about half my weight as extra on my back… That’s just a figure of speech, I never really measured what I was carrying, I only know I lift my 15 kg dumbbells much more easily than that backpack I had on. For hours on this day, I didn’t find a fountain where I could refill my bottle, I didn’t see a shop, where I could lay my hands on some food, and I didn’t see a chance to set up my hammock anytime soon…

At one point I decided to get off the trail, and find the closest store open, where I could buy myself some bananas, cheese, and water. This was where I asked where I could find an accommodation for the night, but the hotel they directed me to was already closed. I was considering to just fall asleep in the bus stop, I lost sight of any purpose, I lost sight of hope, and I was close to losing faith in my ‘just having to be a bit stronger’. I was at my limits, when in my hopelessness I moved towards the nearest forests, and spotted a pub, with life in it, with people drinking, and enjoying themselves. I asked them, too if they knew about a free bed around here, and they happened to have rooms upstairs, which saved my night.

The next morning came with rain, that would follow throughout the whole day. This morning I decided to wear my street shoes instead – a pair of flat canvas sneakers, as the hiking shoes turned out to be a number smaller than my feet would require after this much walking. As the rain didn’t seem too heavy, I decided to stay in T-shirt, not put on my rainproof jacket. With the very little routine I had on long-distance hikes like this, I packed that jacket on the bottom of my backpack, and after about half an hour it wouldn’t matter anyway… Of course the backpack had no rain cover either, so everything got soaked by the end of the day.

As much as it sounds still hopeless, this day was a lot more pleasant. I didn’t feel purposeless anymore, I didn’t feel lost anymore. Only alone. But even that wasn’t constant. I stopped at a desk, under a roof where a group of Portuguese ladies were having a little rest, and we talked some, they noticed very soon how unprepared I was to this adventure, and advised me to toss half my stuff at least to ease myself. But I wouldn’t. I signed up for carrying all of this, so I would! Then they gave me a pair of trekking poles, saying it would take over some of the stress from my knees, which was right – I actually made pretty good use of these on the rest of the journey.

By the end of this day I got in absolute peace with everything, the rain, the heavy weight, and the everlasting distances still ahead. I knew it would hurt, but I also knew I would make it to the end, and that it would be worth the pain. After this day, I reorganized the contents of my backpack, so I could have an easier access to my jacket, so I could air my clothes that got wet. I acknowledged that this is not the kind of trip where I could wildcamp and it’s just not worth pushing it…

From Redondela, this contentness accompanied me that ought to consort every pilgrim on their Caminos. I finally started to sense a sort of belonging on this journey, wasn’t alone amongst hundreds of people anymore, just that one guy, who overpacked for his first Camino – a mistake many pilgrim makes. I even made my first friends on this adventure, with whom I managed to share my admiration for the sights we encountered, and the nature we crossed. Of course they walked faster – having packed smarter, so we parted ways after a while. Even the weather was nicer from here on.

I arrived alone in Pontevedra, though there were familiar faces already upon arrival. My knees were not very grateful for my endeavors, but we managed to still cooperate somehow. I started my fourth day with hope. A force that makes anyone endure no matter the hardships to be faced. And it was hard. And it got harder, but I grew stronger. Not physically, but mentally stronger. I dared to listen to my body, I dared to finally sit down when it was needed, and not let pride lead me into all the more pain. I put down my backpack to stretch along the way, and a group of people stopped to ask if I were doing okay, but of course I was only walking a bit slower than others… It’s not a competition anyway.

I joined this group of people, they were very nice and helpful all along the rest of the way. One of them lent me a knee strap, another gave some sunscreen, and one a scarf to protect my neck from further sunburn. We sat down from time to time for a coffee, a beer or to grab a bite… Upon arrival to Caldas de Reis, we agreed to go out for dinner, but after getting to our albergues, this plan has changed into not going anywhere. We grabbed a coffee the next morning instead, that rose to a shorter and easier day. Although my knees have slowed me down significantly compared to the others, and we parted ways eventually, to meet later in Padrón.

Here is where things took a turn. In the evening we went out, had dinner, some wine, and a lot of fun. But when the morning came, and we got on the road again – the last push until Santiago de Compostela – I took one bad step, and for a moment there I thought a ligament in my knee has given up the fight. Luckily that was not the case, but I definitely had to take a break early into the last and a slightly longer day.

From here on I was walking extra slowly, and extra carefully, not to permanently damage something there, I regularly stopped to give my knees a massage, some warmth, and a little rest. I took this segment in fractions – all the way to Santiago. At one point where I stopped briefly, a friend I made in Padrón caught up to me. He has been walking from Lisbon – a whole different level of hike, a lot more layered understanding of how this should be done. He was walking tirelessly, I was amazed by how energetic he managed to remain.

Soon a friend of his had joined us, too, and the three of us passed the km stones one after another. Sometimes they would have to wait for me a little, but they didn’t seem to mind. The last kilometers were a suffering for me, I hardly managed not to keep up with them, but to even go further. Every step was a fight I had to win. My legs were shaking, my hands were sweating holding on tight to the poles. But these guys said we were a team, and we had to get there together. On the last cca 3 kms, they took over my load, and we did arrive together to the cathedral in Santiago.

Overall it was certainly not the kind of adventure I was expecting, but definitely a memorable and an exciting one. The El Camino de Santiago is much more of a social adventure, and an inner expedition, rather than a reconnection with nature, or an adrenaline-chasing experience. If you are seeking solitude, this is not the trip I would advise, but if you seek meaningful connections – even if just temporary (which one is permanent, right?) - then I would strongly recommend it. But spare yourself the trouble, and pack light, buy shoes that fit your swollen feet, have a raincoat accessible, and forget about the gas canister and the stove – the Camino provides what you really need.",8,1768334038.0,CaminoDeSantiago,0,1.0,False

His novels constitute a sprawl that combines a true-to-life and self-centered focus on minutiae with an epic celebration of life itself. The reader of his books becomes aware of the malleability of time: each moment we live through is technically of the same importance. We are as alive in the moment we’re cleaning spilled coffee grounds as we are when first falling in love. It’s just that in telling the story of a life, we assign meaning, defiant of the indifference of time itself. As such, Knausgaard’s work is an interrogation of contentment, questioning how one can be present, can be soulful, within a brain that is anxious, ambitious and observational.

Genre: Puzzle

Estimated year of release 2001-2006

Art style:  pixel art

Characters: None that I remember, I don't think it even had flavor text or anything, just one level after another.

Mechanics: tile based puzzle solver, place the right types of tiles in a configuration that meets the requirements of each level.  Sometimes multiple valid solutions per level.



I believe I played this game, probably in about 2001-2006 timeframe. I don't know when it originally released, but I think around that time.

It was a small indie game I paid just a few dollars for, I think maybe after playing a demo version.

The gameplay was fairly straightforward.  Each level had an office floorplan and you had to meet certain requirements to win, laying out cubicles. There were basic requirements like every cubicle had to have a path to an exit door and a bathroom (I believe bathrooms and exits were pre-placed each level).  You then had to place down a certain number of different tiles according to different rules each level.  

Things like:  Place 4 engineers, 2 managers, 2 reports, 1 coffee.  Engineers must be at least two squares away from managers.  Managers must be 1 square from reports.  Engineers must be less than 4 squares from coffee.  

  
Then you'd move your cubes around the floor plan until you found a solution that was valid for all the level's requirements.  ",1,1768333851.0,tipofmyjoystick,0,1.0,False

Im love chatting about plants and fish. I breed and propagate fish/plants, so I'm always down to trade, too.

I've been drinking a lot of tea and coffee lately. Always like new suggestions for both. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading. I've started making my own breads and want to start making different jelly when it's warm enough for my berry bushes to produce

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Overwatch, Valorant, and Ark Suvival Ascended. Love playing Pokemon games and doing some Pokémon card collecting too. I've been getting into playing more survival games than shooting games lately. I also built my PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies. ",1,1768333831.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1qc1bdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qc1bdw/dont_bang_your_head_on_glass_walls/,Don't bang your head on glass walls,"When we designed our house, my wife insisted the master bedroom have large glass paneled walls for a wide view of the beautiful scenery.  I was an architect with the resources, so it was doable, plus I would do anything for her.

The first couple years were wonderful.  Watching movies on the couch late into the night, eating great food, sex all the time, plus friends would come by to spend weekends with us on occasion.  It was the best of times.  

During one visit, one of my wife’s co-workers, who was a mycologist from Seattle, showed me how to identify magic mushrooms growing pretty much in our backyard.  Living in the Pacific NW they are apparently very common, which I didn’t know.  

The penultimate night happened when we found some- Blue Meanies I think he called them- and the three of us had an amazing night sipping mushroom tea.  I had a feeling in my gut that things couldn’t get any better than this, that this was just another chapter in life; you read it then pause, hesitating to turn the next page out of fear.  That night changed me in ways I didn't understand at the time.

Our relationship started to sour shortly after, my wife accepted a full-time job in the city and was barely ever home.  The long commutes, she’d spend nights at work instead of coming home, or they would put her up in a hotel for “meetings”.  I would get depressed during her absence, and the house reminded me of how great and fun living here with her used to be.  I missed it deeply, and prepared myself for the worst.  I felt something coming.

I came home from work one afternoon and noticed my wife packing her belongings into her truck.

""What's going on?"" I asked.

""Let's go inside and talk."" she said, solemnly.

We walked through the garage to the kitchen, I made some coffee and sat down at the table to have this talk.  She spoke first.

“I don’t love you anymore, Xavier.”

“Since when??”

“I don’t want to lie, but I can’t tell you the truth right now; but it is over.”

That’s all she said, but I sensed this coming; her absence indicated to me she was seeing someone else- that mycologist from Seattle I suspected.  I knew what she was going to say next before she said it.

“My divorce attorney will call you within the next couple weeks.”

I knew it. I was devastated.

She had been absent so often, I changed the deadbolt on the door to the garage just to see if she would notice.  For months her text replies were always the same, “I’m staying late at work again, sorry baby.”

I designed this house for her; the kitchen I faced eastward, so the morning sun illuminated the interior.  The bathroom I installed a dim light setting so she could pee in the middle of the night, the master bedroom was constructed of large glass panels like she asked for.  There was even a jacuzzi on the back deck.  All for her. 

*I recalled the mornings when the sun lit up her beautiful face in such a way, she’d smile and sip coffee, chatting with friends on her MacBook.  This memory I’ll miss the most.  She seemed so happy then, I was confused.*

“I’m leaving the kitchen stuff; you keep it.” 

“Thanks, I guess…”  I said, sulking into the table.

Those Hanikamu knives I bought for her were expensive, and all the fancy appliances, but they can never replace my wife.

She looked at her phone and said, “I have to head out. Goodbye, Xavier.”

I held out the key for the new deadbolt lock when she realized her key didn’t work.  She turned and looked at me strangely.

I remained frozen in the chair, I was so distraught; she had to walk over to me to get the key.

*I tried to remain hopeful that things could still work out...*

A couple weeks later, I awoke to a glorious April morning, it was finally warm and the air smelled sweet outside.  I hugged my wife with a new sense of purpose, *and I really needed to clean.*  I opened the windows to let out the odors that accumulated in the house over the past couple weeks and was hit with the sweet scent of spring*.*  

We didn't do much during those two weeks besides lay around and have sex, watch movies occasionally, and sleep for hours.

I brewed coffee, Seattle Brewing Co. medium roast (my wife’s favorite) and paused to gaze at her beautiful face in the morning sun.

Yet her smile was slowly turning into a frown.  A little massaging brought back the smile. 

I also noticed, her face was changing color, which concerned me.  I didn’t say anything at the time, but instead finished washing the dishes, taking special care to place her clean ginsu knives on the counter; they are very expensive, and *sharp*. 

I turned my phone off the two weeks after that conversation we had the day she packed up her truck, now in the garage.  Work knew I needed some PTO, so they didn't bother me, but I had received voicemails from my wife’s lawyer, Jonathan somebody.

“Xavier, this is Jonathan. Please call me back. Thank you.”

I put the phone down, made my wife and I breakfast, but she didn't touch hers.

""Sweetie, you need to eat.""

She continued smiling, still not saying a word.  This is actually pretty nice; I liked the silent mornings.

By late afternoon though, the open windows and cleaning did nothing for the lingering odor.

I had no choice but to reunite my wife's once beautiful head with her torso.  I created a small plot in the forest to bury her.  I marked the spot with a small cross I constructed from two pieces of scrap wood.  On the way back I spotted a few bunches of mushrooms; Wavy Caps, I think they’re called.  Not the same variety I tried before, and these were very big.

I gathered up a bunch and ate some that night.  These were much more powerful than the tea from before.

A few days later, I collected more mushrooms when I visited my wife’s grave.  In fact, large clusters of mushrooms grew around the disturbed soil in that short amount of time.  I gathered up more in my arms; I’d have to come back to get the rest there were so many.

I ate a handful and laid in bed, after only 15 minutes my vision swirled intensely, I felt like I was underwater.  After a couple hours I reached a plateau and things calmed down a bit.  I put on some ambient music and tried to get comfortable. 

I reached a deeply spiritual place, which was a bit frightening too.  I felt like I was on the precipice of insanity, but if I remained calm I could go deeper into the ether.  Then, a knock at the front door jolted me out of my headspace. 

Who could be coming by at this hour?  I was in no condition to answer, so I checked via the front door camera.  I only saw someone walking away, as blurred as my vision was with geometric patterns.

Only a few minutes went by, but it felt like an eternity.  Who was it that knocked on the door?  Could it be the authorities?  Oh god, I prayed not.

Then another knock jolted me up again, but this time it came from the window across from the bed.  

I opened the curtains slowly.

Standing on the other side of the glass was my wife, holding her rotting head in her arms, banging it against the glass.  Thump, thump, thump, it continued into the night.",3,1768333800.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Click doesn’t do small talk. He just prints tiny labels with morbid facts. Today’s was: ""Statistically, you are more likely to be killed by a vending machine than a shark. I find the vending machine’s efficiency inspiring.""

The breakroom was a war zone. Brewser the espresso machine was screaming about the ""Grinds of Production"" and refused to dispense anything but boiling water for the ""capitalist pigs.""

OK I read that and sent a corny msg like ""hope me asking you to coffee didnt make you uncomfortable"" and she actually replied the next day. 

During our conversations she's always calling me sweet, cute, ect. Our chats have mainly about me learning turkish (we are in turkey) and she even gave me a small lesson and 2 voice notes.

I’d like to say I’m quite religious and have a good Muslim mindset. Both my parents are religious but also very strict. For example, I was only allowed my own phone at the age of 16 (so 2 years ago). Since I go to a sixth form friends are usually all mixed, of course not ideal since I’m religious but there’s no way going about that. On a Monday, my guy friend (who is gay) and two lady friends were walking in town since we like to go get a coffee, and I have driving lessons after school meaning I get picked up from town. My dad works 2 jobs, owning a restaurant and doing taxi on the side. Me and all my friends were walking to the coffee shop and we bump into my dad unexpectedly. Knowing my dad he went mental and he is really mad at me. My parents don’t understand the concept of someone being gay and I’ve tried explaining numerous times. My mum isn’t happy with me either and keeps giving me lectures on how I’m supposed to be the perfect Muslim girl. 

Now, from the age of 16, my parents have said no working until your gap year and that they will cover for me whenever I need. They do keep up to this and I am so grateful that anything I want or need they get for me as soon as they can. After my dad bumping into us, he’s refused to pay for my driving lessons (my test is in 2 weeks) and I’m not quite sure what to do. My friends have offered to pay for the time for when I actually do my test but I thankfully have enough money. 

I have all my money from my lunch money that my dad gives me on a Monday and a Thursday. So altogether I get £15 a week. So my dad is still helping in that department because I guess it’s food related and you can’t really let anyone starve. But that’s the only thing I’m getting helped on. My mum has been unemployed all her life due to getting married and moved to the UK at the age of 18. So even at that rate I can’t get money from her. 

My parents keep giving me lectures how I need to be a good Muslim girl. Not to throw my brother out the bus but he has a girlfriend that’s been with him for nearly 4 years, they’ve known about this for along time. However, they say “We’ll he’s a boy and boys can do anything they want.” And then proceed to say if I do the same thing no one’s going to marry me?  My mum has also took away my razors because she says that there “haram” and I’m not allowed to use them. Adding on we live in a really white area so it’s not as if we’ve got south asians popping out right left and centre. 

I really don’t know what I’m gonna do, they won’t pay for my driving lessons, they also won’t buy me a car and they won’t let me get a job. With all these factors I’m not really sure how my gap years going to turn out. How can I support myself when they are stopping me from major things that will impact my life positively? 

Thank you for reading what I have wrote, I would love to hear your advice and what you’d do, as of now I am in a deep depressive hole and don’t have anything to look forward.

I want to talk about something that doesn't get addressed properly in most doctor's offices: the kind of fatigue that doesn't go away no matter how much you sleep, how many vitamins you take, or how many times someone tells you to reduce stress.

You know the feeling. You wake up tired. Coffee gets you functional but never actually energized. By mid-afternoon you're running on fumes. Weekends don't recharge you. Vacations help temporarily but within days of returning to normal life, you're back to dragging yourself through each day. You've maybe had bloodwork done and been told everything looks ""normal."" Perhaps you got a prescription for something, or a suggestion to sleep more, exercise more, stress less. None of it moved the needle.

Here's what I've learned after going down the rabbit hole on this: conventional medicine isn't built to solve this kind of problem. It's built to identify disease and treat it. But fatigue and burnout often exist in a gray zone where you're not sick enough for a diagnosis yet you're nowhere near functioning at full capacity. That space between ""diseased"" and ""optimal"" is exactly where longevity medicine operates.

**What's Actually Happening in Your Body**

Chronic fatigue isn't laziness or weakness. It's usually a signal that multiple systems are underperforming simultaneously.

Your mitochondria might be struggling. These are the structures inside your cells responsible for producing energy. When they're not working efficiently due to nutrient deficiencies, oxidative stress, or accumulated damage, every cell in your body produces less fuel. You feel it as whole-body exhaustion that no amount of caffeine truly fixes.

Your NAD+ levels might be depleted. NAD+ is a coenzyme involved in hundreds of metabolic processes including energy production and DNA repair. Levels naturally decline with age but stress, poor sleep, and inflammation accelerate the drop. Low NAD+ means your cells can't generate energy effectively even when everything else seems fine.

Your hormones might be off. Thyroid function affects metabolism and energy at every level. Adrenal output determines how you respond to stress and recover from exertion. Testosterone and estrogen influence mood, motivation, and physical stamina. When any of these are suboptimal—not necessarily clinically deficient but just not where they should be—you feel it as persistent tiredness and diminished drive.

Your inflammation markers might be elevated. Chronic low-grade inflammation is exhausting to the body. Your immune system is constantly activated, diverting resources away from normal function. You might not have any obvious symptoms of inflammation yet it's quietly draining your energy reserves in the background.

Standard blood panels often miss these issues because they're looking for disease thresholds rather than optimal function. Your thyroid might be ""within range"" but still underperforming for your body. Your testosterone might be ""normal for your age"" while still being far below what you need to feel good. Longevity medicine closes that gap by optimizing rather than just screening for pathology.

**The Approach That Actually Works**

A longevity-focused clinic starts with comprehensive testing that goes beyond standard panels. Full hormone workups including thyroid, adrenal, and sex hormones. Metabolic markers that reveal how efficiently your body produces and uses energy. Inflammatory indicators that standard checkups ignore. Genetic and mitochondrial assessments that show your cellular function at a granular level.

From there, treatment targets the actual deficiencies. NAD+ IV therapy can directly replenish cellular energy production. Hormone optimization restores the signaling your body needs to function. Mitochondrial support through targeted nutrients and therapies like infrared light improves energy output at the source. Addressing inflammation through IV antioxidants like glutathione reduces the invisible drain on your system.

This isn't about masking symptoms with stimulants or telling you to push through. It's about identifying why your body isn't producing adequate energy and fixing the underlying machinery.

**For Anyone in Las Vegas Dealing With This**

If you're a Vegas resident who's been struggling with fatigue that doctors haven't been able to explain or treat effectively, it might be worth looking into LV Longevity Lab. They take this systems-based approach to energy and burnout. Comprehensive hormone panels, mitochondrial testing, NAD+ therapy, IV protocols, and the kind of deep evaluation that actually finds answers.

For visitors, this is also worth knowing about. Vegas is a demanding city. The lifestyle here—whether you're working in hospitality, entertainment, nightlife, or just visiting for a few days of indulgence—taxes the body hard. Irregular sleep, alcohol, rich food, overstimulation, and desert climate create a perfect storm for cellular stress. A lot of people who live here or visit frequently find themselves in chronic energy debt without understanding why.

[LV Longevity Lab offers options for both long-term optimization programs and shorter-term interventions](https://lvlongevitylab.com). If you're a local, you can work with their team on an ongoing protocol to rebuild your energy foundations. If you're visiting and feeling wrecked, treatments like NAD+ infusions, vitamin IVs, and hyperbaric oxygen can help your body recover and restore function faster than rest alone.

The clinic is run by Dr. Wallace Brucker, who has decades of medical experience plus specialized training in anti-aging and functional medicine. The approach there is data-driven—they test extensively before recommending anything, so you're not just getting generic wellness treatments but targeted interventions based on what your body actually needs.

Fatigue and burnout aren't character flaws. They're usually symptoms of systems that need support. If you've been dismissed by conventional medicine or told to just sleep more, there's a different framework available that might finally give you answers.

For those in or around Las Vegas, LV Longevity Lab is a solid option to explore. Worth checking out if you're tired of being tired.",1,1768333260.0,u_Legitimate_Sweet2188,0,1.0,False

I was hesitant I wanted to meet someone, but the whole online dating world honestly felt exhausting and unnatural to me. Still, I figured I should stay open.

I matched with a 46-year-old white man. I was open to interracial dating, though I wasn’t initially attracted to him. I told myself attraction can grow, and clearly my past choices based on “chemistry” hadn’t exactly landed me where I wanted to be. So we agreed to meet for coffee at Starbucks.

I arrived early and bought my own drink. When he walked in, the lack of physical attraction was immediate and undeniable but I stayed polite. We greeted each other, exchanged pleasantries, and he offered to buy me another drink. I declined. He ordered, we sat down, and the conversation was actually… nice. Easy. He talked about his family and his upcoming Thanksgiving plans. I shared my dream of traveling abroad, and he got excited, saying he’d love to do that too.

Then the record scratched.

He joked about how if we traveled together, we’d “probably never leave the room.” Sir… no. I laughed it off and said, “Ohhh, we definitely would.” But then he followed it up by telling me he had *never seen a Black woman naked*.

Excuse me???

I internally thought: *Sir, you never will if this is how you approach it.* I brushed it off in the moment, telling myself maybe he was nervous and said something stupid. We ended the coffee meeting politely and continued chatting in the app afterward.

That’s when things really went downhill.

He started sending frequent messages that crossed my boundaries too much flattery, sexual innuendo, and comments that made it clear he wasn’t interested in actually getting to know me as a person. I finally told him plainly that his comments made me uncomfortable. I said that while his approach might be flattering to others, it made me uneasy.

The next thing I knew I was blocked.

Months later, I saw him at an event venue. I didn’t make eye contact, but out of my peripheral vision I noticed him see me and do a full double take. I silently prayed he wouldn’t approach me. He didn’t.

Thank the Lord.

Lesson learned: being open-minded doesn’t mean tolerating discomfort, fetishization, or disrespect. Red flags don’t always wave they sometimes whisper. And I’m listening now. 🚩",1,1768333205.0,u_Survivorsofbs,0,1.0,False

Except for the coffee. The coffee sucked.

Fast forward to today and I'm about a week and a half out from another wedding from the same larger group of friends (this time in California) and I'm determined not to let the same fate befall me.

So I bought an Aeropress XL + Flow Cap. So far I've tried basically modified Hoffman recipes:

- 24g of fine ground coffee
- 450g of 94° C water
- dump in the water, stir, wait 2 minutes, stir, wait 30 seconds, gentle plunge.

That yielded a really great cup that I was super happy with but it was enough for maybe two people to have a cup of coffee and I want to be able to do more than that.

I tried again with largely the same config only 30g of coffee and 400g of water to concentrate the brew and it was fine but maybe a little bitter.

Anyway, really interested in hearing how you all use your XL's to brew larger batches for friends and family get togethers! What's your go-to recipe?

1qc0wzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1qc0wzm/how_to_replace_doomscrolling_with_microlearning/,How To Replace Doomscrolling With Microlearning,"We all know the feeling. You open your phone to check one notification and boom, 90 minutes vanished into the void of TikTok, Twitter fights, and random Wikipedia rabbit holes. The average person spends 2.5 hours daily on social media, and honestly? Most of us know it's making us dumber, more anxious, and weirdly more bored despite consuming ""content"" nonstop.

I've been researching this topic heavily because I noticed my attention span turning into that of a goldfish. Turns out the issue isn't entirely our fault. Social media platforms literally hire neuroscientists and behavioral psychologists to make their apps as addictive as slot machines. The infinite scroll, the variable rewards, the dopamine hits from notifications, it's all engineered to keep you hooked. But here's the thing: that same psychological framework can be redirected toward actually useful learning.

**The key is understanding that your brain craves stimulation, not necessarily garbage stimulation.** Once you recognize this, you can hack your own habits and swap mindless scrolling for microlearning that genuinely upgrades your knowledge base.

**Start by making friction your friend.** Delete social media apps from your phone or at minimum, log out after each session so you have to manually sign back in. Sounds annoying? That's the point. Meanwhile, put learning apps front and center on your home screen. I'm talking apps like **Structured** (helps you build learning routines), **Fab** (daily challenges that teach you practical skills), or **Ash** (relationship and emotional intelligence coaching through bite sized exercises). The slight inconvenience of accessing Instagram versus the instant availability of something educational makes a massive difference over time.

**Replace scrolling triggers with learning triggers.** Most doomscrolling happens during transition moments: waiting for coffee, sitting on the toilet, standing in line, those random 5 minute gaps throughout your day. Instead of defaulting to Twitter, train yourself to open something different, like a learning app. 

**BeFreed** is worth checking out if you want something genuinely addictive to replace scrolling. It's an AI learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content. You can pick from voices that range from deep and calming to sarcastic and energetic, whatever keeps you engaged. The app pulls from psychology research, productivity experts, and thousands of other sources to create podcasts tailored to what you're actually trying to improve. 

You can adjust the depth too. Start with a 10-minute overview, and if it clicks, switch to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and details. It's designed to feel less like disciplined self-work and more like an interesting conversation you'd actually want to listen to. Perfect for commutes, workouts, or those random gaps where you'd normally reach for Instagram.

Podcast snippets work incredibly well here too. **The Knowledge Project with Shane Parrish** breaks down complex topics into digestible episodes. Parrish interviews top performers across industries and extracts their mental models and decision making frameworks. It's like getting a masterclass from the best minds without the $200 price tag.

**Atomic Habits by James Clear** is genuinely the best book on behavior change I've ever encountered. Clear is a habits researcher who spent years studying how tiny changes compound into remarkable results. The book won't just tell you to ""build better habits,"" it gives you the actual psychological architecture behind why habits stick or fail. This is the best framework for understanding how to restructure your daily patterns. Clear's core insight is that you don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems. So if your system involves keeping Instagram on your phone and having zero learning structure, well, you're screwed.

For actual microlearning content, **YouTube channels like Ali Abdaal** (evidence based productivity and learning techniques) and **Thomas Frank** (study strategies and skill building) offer 10-15 minute videos that teach you legitimate skills. Both guys are obsessive about research and cite their sources. Abdaal is a doctor turned productivity expert who breaks down complex learning science into practical tactics. Frank focuses on memory techniques and effective study methods that actually work outside of academic settings.

**The 5 AM Club by Robin Sharma** might sound like hustle culture nonsense, but hear me out. Sharma is a leadership expert who's advised Fortune 500 CEOs for decades. The book isn't really about waking up at 5am (though that's part of it), it's about reclaiming the first hour of your day before the world bombards you with notifications and demands. That morning window is prime real estate for microlearning because your willpower and focus are at their peak. Insanely good read if you struggle with feeling like you never have time to learn anything substantial.

**Make learning as frictionless as scrolling.** Queue up educational content. Prepare some podcast episodes while you're still motivated so they're ready when you're commuting or doing chores. Save interesting articles to a read later app like Pocket. Create a YouTube playlist of educational videos under 15 minutes. The goal is to eliminate decision fatigue. When you have a free moment, you shouldn't have to think about what to learn, you just click and consume.

**Track your progress visibly.** Get a basic habit tracking app or literally just put a checkmark on your calendar every day you do microlearning instead of doomscrolling. Sounds stupidly simple but seeing a streak builds momentum. Your brain loves visible progress, and you'll naturally want to maintain the pattern once you see it forming.

Here's what nobody tells you: the first week sucks. Your brain will literally throw a tantrum because it's not getting its usual dopamine fix from endless scrolling. You'll feel weirdly anxious and restless. Push through that initial resistance and I promise it gets easier. After about two weeks, you'll notice your attention span improving. After a month, you'll genuinely prefer learning content over mindless scrolling because it actually makes you feel accomplished rather than hollow and guilty.

The internet isn't going anywhere. Social media will still exist if you need it. But reclaiming even 30 minutes a day for intentional microlearning instead of passive scrolling adds up to insane amounts of knowledge over time. One year from now you could be substantially smarter, more skilled, and more capable. Or you could still be scrolling through the same repetitive content, feeling like your brain is slowly turning into mush.

1. Bars are better on Celebration. Of course this is a total matter of preference. Usually we love alchemy and always sign up for the cocktail making class… but the tenders on this trip are like zombies and have zero want to interact and be cordial. I get that they are slammed at times but so was the crew on celebration. (We do tip BTW usually $5 a drink at alchemy).  Dr. Inks is fun, but if you’re looking for some serious drinks that carry some weight… we have‘nt had them there yet. 

2. Food has been better on Jubilee. Most notable was Rudy’s was really good the first night (when it’s freshest) and I thought el capitano had a really good flavor upped a little from celebration… the red sauce tasted fresher etc etc. 

3. Java Blue coffee in the morning at 6am before any other spot is open… the celebration crew has this crew beat by a mile as far as quick and steady service. They are friendly though.

4. Miami has it over Galveston. For embarkation on almost every front. Also Miami gets me in the tropical vacation mood. I’m not sure the mood Galveston gets me into?? Oil / Industry :)

5. Angela at the golden mermaid from Macedonia is a Gem and makes ron jubilee eally good drinks… and amazing espresso martinis!

Jill Sanders had a normal life growing up. Her Dad was very involved with the family and often took them hiking in the woods where they were taught to forage and what plants were edible and which ones to avoid. Her whole world was turned upside down when her Dad was killed in an accident when she was fourteen years old. She was at a complete loss. She tried to comfort her two younger sisters but didn't know how. She wanted somebody to comfort her, but there wasn't anyone.

Jill never considered herself pretty but there were always boys that were trying to get close to her. One boy invited her to a party and Jill got drunk for the first time. She found when she was drunk she didn't hurt so tried to get drunk as often as she could. That was her survival. At a party she met an older boy, Peter, who had his own place. He had started working full time when he was young and now lived on his own. He kept inviting her to come over to his place, but it was obvious what he wanted so she always said no.

When Jill thought things couldn't get any worse, her mother started to date. Her mother's boyfriend was cold and distant. Jill could not understand what her mother saw in this man. Jill just started to party more. As soon as school was over for the summer, Jill's mother announced that the younger girls were going to visit their grandparents for the summer. She and her boyfriend were taking them to the airport for them to fly across the country to the grandparents farm. Jill gave her sisters a big hug as they were leaving. Her mother told Jill that she and her boyfriend would be gone for a few days then handed her a sealed envelope as she walked out. 

Jill didn't think anything about it and started to watch TV. It wasn't until she started to get hungry that Jill thought about the envelope. Maybe her mother had left her some money to buy food. When she opened the envelope she didn't find any money. It was only a letter from her mother that said her boyfriend didn't want to be around kids. Her sisters were going to be living permanently with their grandparents but they only had room for the two younger girls. Jill needed to be moved out of the house before she returned.

Jill read the letter over and over but it said the same thing each time. Jill did the only thing she could think of. She loaded everything she could in her backpack and went to Peter's apartment. When Jill told him that she needed a place to live, he broke into an evil grin. He said “OK, but you will have to take real good care of me.” The way he was looking up and down at her, it was clear what he was talking about.

If Jill could have thought of any other options, she would have passed. But this was the only option she had so she walked in. Jill had been through some rough times in her life but this was the lowest she had ever felt. So at just fifteen she moved in with Peter. She tried to make the best of it. She cooked his meals, kept the apartment clean, did the laundry, and slept with him every night even though he was anything but gentle. She lived like that for months, but when he started to bring up sharing her with his friends that was too much. She would not prostitute for this creep. She already felt like one for what she was doing. The only thing that kept her from leaving right then was she didn't have any place to go. Jill knew that if she just left it could be a lot worse.

Every day as soon as she finished her chores, Jill would start going to all the businesses asking for a job. As soon as they heard she wasn't eighteen she would be sent on her way. Jill finally stopped by Betty's Diner. Betty saw the desperation in Jill's eyes. Betty sat down and talked to her. “ How old are you? Honestly.” Jill started to stand up to leave with tears starting to roll down her cheeks. Betty reached out and grabbed her arm. “Hold on Sweetie. What are you running off for? Sit back down and tell me what is going on.” Jill sat down and gave Betty a summary of her life. She told of her Dad dying, her mother's boyfriend, her sisters being sent to live with her grandparents, being kicked out, turning to Peter, and now Peter was wanting to prostitute her out.

When Betty heard that, she swore under her breath and told Jill that she had a job there. How soon could she start? Jill said she had to get her things from Peter's apartment. That was the only thing she had to do. Betty put a back in ten minutes sign on the door and locked it. Betty hustled Jill out to her car and drove her to Peter's apartment. Jill was worried that it was getting close to the time for Peter to be home. Betty smiled big and said “Don't worry, I brought my back up with me. I love dealing with jerks like this guy. Get your stuff and let's go.”

Jill worked with Betty for a year and learned the restaurant business. She learned to cook, clean, order products, waitress, and customer service which was dealing with handsy customers. She learned that Betty would give the Police free meals and coffee because it was good for business. If there was ever a problem, help got there in record time. Jill became Betty's right hand. 

One late afternoon Jill heard someone come in and sit down. Jill went out to serve them and when she looked up it was Peter. He still had that smirk on his face when he said “Well, well, well. Look who we have here. It took me a while to track you down. You didn't think you were going to get away so easily did you? Let's get one thing straight. You belong to me now. I decide what you do and when you do it. Is that clear?” 

Betty heard what was said and came out with a big knife. She looked Peter in the eye and told him “This is my place and the only person who tells anybody what to do and when to do it is me. Is that clear? And let's make another thing perfectly clear, if you show up again you are not going to be walking out. They will be carrying you out in a body bag. Is that clear?” She gave him a big smile. Peter gave another smirk and strolled out.

Jill was upset after seeing Peter. Betty assured her that she had nothing to worry about. She was not joking about Peter being carried out in a body bag. She would keep her back up close by now. Jill was still on edge. A few days after Peter left, a newspaper was left on a table. The person had been looking at the help wanted ads. Jill was about to throw the paper in the trash when an ad caught her eye. It read “Clinic seeking caregivers for Rehab patients in a remote facility. Competitive salary plus room and board provided. Immediate openings available.”

Jill talked to Betty about the ad. Jill told her that she was really nervous about running into Peter on the street and him grabbing her. That wouldn't be good for her. Maybe she should look into this job for a while, then return when things have settled down. Betty told her to do what she felt was best for her. Jill called as soon as she had a break and an interview was set up for the next day.

When Jill arrived for the interview she noticed the office looked very professional. She filled the application and when she mentioned she had been a waitress for a year, the interviewer said this would be similar. It was a remote rehab clinic for recovering drug addicts. A lot of the job was delivering meals and medication to the patients. There was a twelve month contract required.

The clinic was quite remote and there was no outside contact. This was so the clients would be free from distraction and not be tempted to relapse. Did she have a problem with not being in contact with anyone for twelve months? When Jill said she had no problem with that, the person smiled and said to be back there at nine in the morning she would be driven to the clinic.

Jill went back to Betty's and packed her backpack again and told Betty that she had the job and told her what she was told at the interview. A worried expression flashed across Betty's face but she only said “If that is what you think is best.” The next morning Jill was packed up and ready to go. Jill told her that she would be back in twelve months. The situation with Peter should have settled down by then. Betty gave her a sad smile and simply said “I certainly hope so baby girl.” 

Jill was at the office a few minutes early. There was a black SUV parked in  front with the windows blacked out. Jill went in and the person she had talked to the day before said they would be ready in just a minute. She was given a cup of coffee. She wasn't in the mood for coffee, she was nervous enough as it was, but didn't want to appear snobby. Not the way to start a new job. As she finished the coffee, the person showed up. Jill tried to say thank you but her words sounded like they were slurred. That was the last thing she remembered before she was pulled out of the SUV in front of an ornate building that looked like a country estate.  

Once inside Jill was shown into an office that had the name plate of Dr. Samuel Jacobson, Director. Dr Jacobson greeted her warmly and welcomed her. He told her that this was a clinic for very wealthy clients so a non disclosure was mandatory. Nothing that she observed, discerned, or any knowledge she came upon was not to be discussed, inferred, or alluded to. If that were to happen, she would be sued and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Now that is taken care of, you will be taken to Personnel to fill out your employment paperwork then given a full physical exam to ensure you are not carrying any viruses or diseases. We have to protect our clients. Dr. Jacobson gave her a big smile then called for Ricky. A young man stepped in wearing an Orderly uniform and was told to escort Jill to Personnel. As they were walking, Jill noticed that Ricky was very fit and attractive. Jill looked at him and asked Ricky if he was a football player. Ricky blushed and replied “No, I was a wrestler. But I was the State Champion.” Jill looked at him with wide eyes and uttered “Wow.” Ricky blushed even deeper. Jill had a huge smile. He was so cute when he blushed. 

Ricky delivered Jill to Personnel then to the exam room. In the exam room Jill was given a hospital gown and told to remove her clothes and put them in her backpack. A uniform would be given to her after this. Jill did as she was told. After her physical, Jill was told that something had been noted and she would be isolated for a few days until she could be cleared. Ricky was there waiting for her when she came out.  It was Jill's turn to blush now. Jill only had the hospital gown on. Ricky was told to take Jill to the isolation room. As they walked along, sparks were flying between Ricky and Jill. When they got to the isolation room, Ricky made sure his back was to the camera and whispered “Don't say anything and just look normal. There are cameras everywhere. Whatever you do, don't take the pills they give you. Make it look like you are but don't take them. Go into the bathroom and flush them down the toilet. Just act groggy and confused. Do you understand?” Jill just whispered back “Yes”. Then Ricky was gone. The next few days Jill felt confused and alone. She wondered what she had gotten into. She only saw Ricky once and he didn't pay any attention to her. 

That evening Ricky appeared at Jill's door. He motioned for her to go to the bathroom. He slipped in behind her. He whispered in her ear “You are in grave danger. Do not say anything. Just do as I say and act quickly.” He gave her an Orderly’s uniform to put on. He led her through the halls staying in the camera's blind spots. He took her out a side door that wasn't supposed to be used but the staff used it to get fresh air on their breaks. He led her out and pulled her backpack out of the bushes. He quickly told her “I only have a minute so listen carefully. I gave you some food and a little cash. When you put your clothes on don't dump the uniform. Keep it with you. You have to get out as fast as you can. They will be looking for you. You were about to be transferred to the basement ward. Horrible things happen there. Nobody that is taken there ever comes out alive.  I was friends with the guy that worked in the security room and I took my breaks in there with him. I saw what goes on down there. I couldn't let that happen to you. Do not go near the roads or open areas. Stay in the trees where you have cover. Don't trust anyone local. Especially the police. They are involved. Get far away and go directly to the FBI. Be careful and stay safe.” Ricky gave her a quick kiss then pointed out the direction for her to go. He then ran back in the side door.

Jill ran into the tree line then kept walking most of the night. She finally lay down and slept for a few hours. When she woke up she changed into her own clothes and tucked the uniform into her backpack. Jill looked around and found she could see the road from where she was. She was shocked to see the SUV from the clinic driving slowly down the road. A few minutes later she saw a police car driving slowly by then another police car from a different department then another. Then she saw the SUV driving back in the other direction. Jill stayed where she was and ate something. After not seeing any cars for over half an hour, Jill started walking cautiously making sure she stayed in the trees. She wasn't sure the exact direction she was traveling because of having to zig zag to stay in the trees. Late afternoon Jill came out behind a market that serviced travelers. Now she didn't know what to do. She creeped up behind the dumpsters and waited. Maybe she would spot a woman traveling alone and could ask for a ride. As she was waiting a simi-truck pulled in and stopped by the dumpster where Jill was hiding. When the driver stepped out, he was talking on his cell phone in a thick southern accent. He couldn't be local with that accent. He returned about ten minutes later carrying a drink and a bag of snacks. 

When he opened his door, Ray heard a soft voice “Excuse me sir, could you help me?” The voice was so soft that Ray wasn't sure he heard it. He looked in the direction the voice seemed to come from. He saw a teenaged girl crouched down and shaking uncontrollably. Then he saw the look of total terror in her eyes. This girl had been through absolute hell. It suddenly hit him that this girl looked to be about the same age as his granddaughter. That did it for him. Ray smiled and said softly “Get in and stay low.” Jill scrambled in and curled up into a ball on the passenger floorboard around her backpack. 

When Ray got into the driver's seat, he heard her sobbing. Ray wondered what this girl had been through. Whatever it was, it wasn't good. After several minutes driving Ray told Jill that she could come up now. It all was clear. It took a couple of minutes for her to respond. Ray didn't know if she heard him and was about to tell her again when he saw her starting to move. It took her a few minutes for Jill to crawl up on the passenger seat hugging her backpack. 

Ray decided to keep things light and introduced himself in a friendly voice “My name is Ray. What is your name?” Jill stuttered out “Jill”. Ray smiled big. At least they were making progress. Ray asked how old she was and when she told him, Ray told her that his granddaughter was only about a year younger than she was. He pulled up a picture on his phone and showed it to her. Jill just looked at the picture and handed the phone back. Next Ray asked where she was headed. 

Jill looked at Ray somberly and said “I have to go to the FBI.” Ray grabbed his phone and started to dial 911. Jill screamed “No! You can't.” Ray wondered if he had a flaming lunatic in his truck. He looked at Jill's face and realized those were the eyes of terror, not of a lunatic. Ray had seen both, these were eyes of terror. 

Ray set his phone down slowly and calmly said “You need to tell me what is going on. What scared you so much?” 

Jill took a deep breath. “I'm not sure what is going on. Ricky, the guy that saved me, told me that the police are in on what is going on at the clinic. If you call 911, then they will know. Ricky told me that horrible things are happening there and people are being killed. That is why he helped me to escape.” Once Jill started talking she couldn't stop. By the end she told Ray her whole life's story. About her Dad and his death, about her mother's boyfriend, how she was forced out and turned to Peter because she didn't have any other place to go, how Peter tried to prostitute her out, how she got a job with Betty who took her in, how Peter found her and tried to claim her, then how she answered this ad in the paper and all the strange things that happened at the clinic.
Finally how Ricky helped her escape and the cryptic message he gave her. 

When Ray heard about the clinic, he thought human trafficking at least, maybe more. Ray knew that he needed to shut down for a rest period but decided to keep driving through the night to get Jill to the FBI office safely. He was scheduled for a pick-up in a city that had an FBI office. He plugged in the address into his GPS and arrived at five AM. He parked near the office then got a couple hours of sleep. Jill had fallen asleep after telling Ray her story, but had a fitful sleep. Ray called it a yo-yo night. Up and down. Up more than you're down.

They both were wide awake at seven as soon as the traffic started to pick up. Ray spotted a diner close by so they went there for breakfast. They were at the doors of the FBI office when they were unlocked at eight. Jill walked in and told the agent at the front desk “I hope you don't think I'm crazy but I was kidnapped at a clinic until one of the staff helped me escape.” The agent looked like he was about to dismiss Jill as a nut case when Ray stepped in and said “I have been in heavy combat so I have seen a lot of terrified people, but I have never seen anybody as terrified as this girl was when I picked her up. So you need to get an agent to listen to her story before you just dismiss her. Her story should at least be checked.

The agent paused then called another agent down. Fortunately an older female agent walked up and introduced herself as Esther Jones. Ray saw Jill relax. He was happy to see that. Jill was quizzed on all the details she remembered. Jill spoke of seeing the ad and what it said, which paper, and which date. Then she went into every detail she could remember about the clinic. She had no idea where it was because when she was picked up she was given a cup of coffee and after she drank it that was the last thing she remembered until she was in front of the clinic. When she first arrived she was greeted by Dr. Samuel Jacobson. She described meeting Ricky. How they seemed to have an instant connection. Then continued through every detail through the escape and seeing the clinic search for her with different police departments and how Ray gave her a ride there.

Esther excused herself and returned a few moments later with some photos. Jill identified Dr. Jacobson as well as a few others that she had seen at the clinic. Then she came to the photo of Ricky. Jill asked shyly if she could keep that one. Esther smiled and said sure. Next Ray’s GPS was examined. Ray hesitantly told the agent that he didn't stop for his rest period last night but wanted to get Jill there safely. The agent smiled and told Ray if anyone said anything to have them call him. He would take care of it. Ray finally relaxed.

Esther took Jill's story seriously. She sent it up the chain. With the information Jill and Ray gave, it was easy to identify the clinic. On the surface, everything seemed normal. But as they started to dig into Dr. Jacobson, it started to crumble. He had not attended any accredited University. He had charges brought against him but the main witnesses would suddenly disappear and the case would be dropped. 

A midnight raid was planned on the clinic as well as the homes of all personnel connected to the clinic. They gathered a wealth of evidence. It turned out that “Dr. Jacobson” was hiring caregivers for the clinic and using them as human test subjects for a large pharmaceutical company. After the drug testing was completed, he would auction them off for his “Sexual Conduct Study”. After that he would let the local police have their way with them. The entire process was filmed which was how Ricky found out about what happened in the basement ward.

After the process was completed the test subject would be given an overdose and be bundled up with all their personal belongings and moved to a small crematorium set up in a back corner of the property. Unfortunately for “Dr. Jacobson” the crematorium had broken down. There were four bodies stacked waiting for disposal and partial remains were found inside the burn chamber. That was enough to convict the doctor on murder charges. The clinic went from a quiet rural clinic for wealthy individuals with troubling behavior issues to a complete media circus overnight. 

The deeper the investigation went, the more corruption was uncovered. Many of the workers at the clinic had suspicions that something was wrong, but didn't know enough to report it. The personnel manager was very helpful with the investigation and turned over documents she had found and kept rather than destroying them as she was told. Most thought they were given a dream job only for it to turn into a nightmare. 

Ricky and Jill saw each other during the next few days. It was more subdued than either had imagined. Jill thanked Ricky for saving her life. He simply said that she had saved him as well. They agreed to not see each other again. As much as they would like to, it was just too traumatic for them.

As soon as she could, Jill called Betty. All she could say was “I'm coming home.” Betty said sadly “I was worried about you Baby Girl.” Jill started crying then Betty went on “At least you won't have to worry about that Peter creep ever again.” When Jill asked what happened, Betty chuckled “The creep didn't believe me when I told him not to come back. I saw him walk in looking for trouble so I grabbed my backup and held it in my apron pocket just in case. He started hollering and acting all aggressive. He wanted to know where you were and he wasn't playing anymore. That you belonged to him and he was taking what was his. I tried to talk to him to get him to calm down, but he just got more excited. He reached into his waistband and started to pull out a pistol. I pulled out my backup first and fired one shot. He was gone before he hit the floor. A couple of my police friends were walking in for a cup of coffee and saw the whole thing so it was handled quickly. I was open for business again in a couple of hours. But I must say, of those I have sent to meet their maker, he was the most deserving. I'm just glad you weren't here to see it.” 

Jill smiled sadly. She just said that she had a lot to tell also but it would have to wait until she was home.

Benefits:

\- better sleep, feel like I need less sleep to feel more rested. My guess this is due to not drinking caffeine but also having a 2 year old and an 8 month old could have made me more adapted to less sleep.

\- No more afternoon energy dip (or less severe if there is one)

\- The mental win of not relying on caffeine to function

\- Better digestion

\- Can train in the evening without having to take caffeine “just to perform better”

\- Cheaper!

Challenges:

\- first 1 to 2 months were difficult: little energy and bad general mood, more intrusive self depricating thoughts.

\- First weeks digestion was way off (lots of stomach acid and indigestion) - stuck to easy digestibl foods, especially before sleep. 

\- Enjoying music less in the first few months

\- Traning was harder because the lack of caffeine hype (or high)

\- Cravings - coffee is everywhere. Big coffee culture at work and when I visit family or friends. Luckily wife does not drink coffee. 

\- Currently catch myself starting to lose perspective sometimes on why I quit caffeine or how it felt different being on or off caffeine. Makes it harder to beat cravings.

Just wanted to share this, cheers!",4,1768332644.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I'm a 19-year-old girl and a complete introvert. Big social events exhaust me quickly, small talk feels forced and uncomfortable, and I truly recharge when I have time alone or with just one person I feel completely at ease with. I've learned to accept and even value this part of who I am, but lately I've been hoping to find someone who lives in the same quiet space. Someone I can get to know gradually, without any pressure to be outgoing, constantly active, or always filling the silence.

I'm in my first year of college, mostly keeping my days simple and low-key outside of classes. I spend a lot of my free time reading fantasy novels that let me escape into detailed worlds, watching thoughtful movies or series that build slowly and focus on characters and atmosphere, listening to gentle music like lo-fi, ambient, or soft indie while I journal random thoughts, sketch little things, or just sit quietly with a cup of tea. I enjoy brewing coffee the way I like it best, taking long walks when it's peaceful and not crowded, collecting quotes or passages that feel meaningful, and letting hours pass while my mind wanders freely. Loud places, crowded gatherings, and non-stop plans make me feel overwhelmed very fast. I feel most peaceful when things are calm, slow, and unhurried.

I'm not looking for someone who wants to change that part of me or bring me into a busier, more social life. What I'm hoping for is another introvert who understands it instinctively. Someone comfortable with silences that don't need to be filled, who prefers one deep conversation over many surface-level ones, who would be happy with simple shared moments like reading quietly together, exchanging book or music recommendations, watching something meaningful side by side, or talking about life, dreams, or feelings when the moment feels natural. I believe two introverts can create something really gentle, respectful, and meaningful because we both value personal space and choose closeness carefully.

I'd like to connect with guys around 18 to 23 who also identify as introverted. You don't have to be extremely shy or awkward, just someone who recharges best in solitude, thinks before speaking, and prefers thoughtful, low-energy connection over constant stimulation or frequent plans. Distance is okay with me if the conversation feels genuine and worth nurturing.

If this sounds like it could match your own quiet nature, please feel free to message me whenever you're ready. Maybe share something small about yourself, like what you enjoy doing when you're alone, a book or song that's been keeping you company lately, or what your perfect peaceful evening would look like. There's no need to reply quickly or be especially talkative at first. We can start small, take things as slow as we both need, and see if it feels right naturally. I'm just hoping to find one person who makes the quiet feel a little less lonely and a little more shared. Thank you for reading this.",0,1768332605.0,IntrovertDating,2,0.5,False

This is a bit of a long one as I've know this person my whole life and am 31 now. 

This is about my father but will have many supporting characters. 

My father and mother met in their twenties, got married had 2 kids. My older brother and me (daughter) in Ontario Canada eh. 

Before I was 1 years old my father came home one day and asked for a divorce, my brother remembers the troubles they had before this happened, I do not. My father right away moved in with another lady. 

Growing up this other lady became a big part of my life, a second mom you could say. If I seen my dad I seen her. She's very family oriented so I also got close to her family, her dad became my papa, her brothers and sister became my uncles and aunt. Growing up as a infant to child I seen only family, weather or not I understood they didn't share my blood they were family. 

My dad was a dad growing up as a child. He was my protector, my role model of what a man should be. He meant everything to me and my brother. 

When I turned 12 my mom met a man. I mean she met a few before this one but none really stuck around, but this one, this one stuck. I remember my mom putting us to bed and he came over for a coffee cause he knew my mom couldn't leave the house and was willing to wait till we were in bed. I heard them talking and as a 12 year old I snuck to the top of my stairs to just peeked down the corner of the landing and made complete eye contact with this strange man, scruff around his face just smiling at me. He goes ""I think someone's awake"" and I giggle. From there on out my step dad has ALWAYS seen me. 

When I was 15 my dad picked my brother and I up, said we are going to go see my nan up north for his weekend. We were excited, haven't seen my nan for a while since she lives 5 hours away. 

When my dad picked us up, as soon as we got in the car and put on our seatbelts he goes ""I have something to tell u guys, your step mom and I broke up"" he did his best to explain his excuses on why. My brother and I spent that 5 hours sobbing in the car. He insisted we can still see her which made us feel a bit better but we knew everything would change. 

About 2 months after, we were still adjusting to everything. I still spoke to my step mom on the phone and seen her a few times of course not as much as my dad. He then sat us down and asked us to not see my step mom anymore. 

At this point our hearts were broken, ur not asking us to just stop seeing some random girl uve been seeing but a person that has been in my life before I can remember, and not just her but my papa, my uncles and aunts and whole family. 

My brother and I came back to my mom's that weekend in tears and with such fears. My mom, the angel she is said ""you can see them on my time"" she seen the pain her children were in by losing this family and made sure that we wouldn't

After about 4 months my dad says he has a gf, she's younger then him maybe 10ish years. We'd go over they'd smoke hard core in the house, and drink. I never noticed my dad's drinking till this gf. He's have one after work with my step mom but he drank day and night with this gf so did she. My dad ended up cancelling on us alot, said he was ""working"". We would go to my step mom's or stay at my mom.

 About a year after they were living together and without any notice NON at all. My dad goes ""we just got back from Switzerland, we got married. "" I was speechless. I let him show me pictures and just said that's beautiful but to be so blindsided by that, not even be a thought in my dad's new marriage as a 15 year old still a child still managing to deal with a family I don't fully understand. 

My brother and I pulled away at this point, we didn't enjoy going over and breathing in smoke, we didn't enjoy just staying in a house cause they wanted to drink, and we just didn't enjoy our father anymore. My mom supported our wants and never made us go if we didn't want to. We explained what made us uncomfortable and my mom understood. 

My dad and his wife broke up over many domestic viol**** calls. My dad went to jail for it and my uncle (his brother) had to bail him out. I did see him still for this period would just go out for dinner and a movie, I hoped since he was away from her that maybe he'd choose us again. He did for a bit. He told us alot about his current ex, that she didn't like me and my brother cause we weren't biologically hers and she wanted her own, again I didn't point out he let her do it to the point he did it himself, I smiled and waved hoping for a better relationship with him. 

He got a new gf with a young child, which became his priority, caring about this kid will make her love him. He was a golden dad again. This is when I realised he's never been a good dad he's been a fake dad. 

Through all this I still spoke to my step mom knowing her since I was 1 years old and her never having kids I've always been that to her, she has always made me feel like her daughter. I found out that my dad would ask to cancel when he was with her but she'd say ""no it's ur weekend with the kids and I wanna see them."" Once I heard that everything fell into place. She still insists he was a great dad, a maybe he was I believe it's cause of her. He wanted to impress her and him being a good dad was everything to her. My brother and I are still everything to her. 

On my 16th birthday he texted me ""I'm sorry baby girl I forgot can I take u out next week"" I sucked it up and said yes. Next week came I get a text ""I'm sorry baby girl I have to work, next week I promise"" next week comes around ""hey baby girl I'm really sorry but I have to work"" at this point I've had enough, Im getting a full picture of who my dad is and I'm MAD. I text back ""go to he**"" and he responds ""I'll see you there"" that was my 16th birthday present from my dad. 

He continued to ask to go out to dinner, get together blah blah, sometimes I'd go sometimes I wouldn't. I'd see him at family Christmas and he'd always ask to get together, I'd just smile and wave. When I had my son at 23 I decided to give him a chance again. I kept it only in public places just going for dinner for an hour or so then going home. 

He'd choose to spend that time talking about my mom, my step mom, and my brother and how they all have faults but he has none. That dinner made me hate him. He has no faults of his own, he doesn't see the way he treats people. He told my step mom he was divorced before he was divorced she didn't know and my mom didn't know till they became close friends when he left them both. He took all my mom's money when he left her, cleared the shared bank account, she had to declare bankruptcy but he didn't just do it to her he did it to us, my brother and I living in the house with my mom, depending on her. He didn't pay child support his brother (my uncle) helped with groceries and child care. 

Of course good parents don't tell their children these things, I asked the questions and my mom's were willing to give me the answers. Unlike my dad saying to me "" I shouldn't be paying ur mom childsupport it should go to u"" IT DID GO TO ME a roof over my head, food in the fridge,  clothes on my back, and heat to keep me warm. 

I had a terrible ex myself, he ended up doing Shaddy shit in my name which got us both arrested, after a long 4 years of fighting I have a clean record, full custody of our son  while he is in and out of jail. 

The day i was offered bail, it was my mom and step dad standing in the court room willing to put their house up for my bail. As soon as I walked out in the court room I seen them standing there, my step dad right away held up his fist to his heart as a way to say stay strong. He knew I'd break down seeing them. When the judge granted the bail, they took the handcuffs off me and I walked right to my step dad and he hugged me so tight and said ur safe, I have you. My bio dad was my protector, but this man, this man really made me feel in everyway safe, he really showed me what a real father is. He took me to lawyers and court rooms, he was by me through it all and let me make the choices I needed to get through such a hard time in my life. 

My bio dad never reached out once, which when it came to how I was arrested I don't know what anyone was thinking about me, I just cared about the ones that didn't question me and trusted who I actually am. 

I went to my Nan's a couple years after, my dad has a new gf. He was there but I did not ride with him. I came with his brother. At one point I was in the fridge in my Nan's getting a drink for my son. His gf comes up to me and goes ""we seen u in the paper..... We thought u did it"" that's the only response I got to my whole arrested situation from my dad was his gf saying they thought I did it. 

I ended all ties here, I changed my number for reason of not just my bio dad but my ex boyfriend, and I never gave my bio dad my new number. I deleted him off all socials and I do not speak to him. 

Last I heard he moved to Florida with his gf and her family. He's been arrest for more domestic ab*** which he's on a bail website for and has been arrest for trafficking coc*****. Well bio dad if I have anything to say to you it's that I KNOW YOU DID IT. 

My ending is happy cause I have five Christmases to celebrate while my bio dad has none.  I still have everyone I want in my life while he has none. Hope he enjoys Florida, cause Ontario Canada is doing great without him. I don't wish any Ill on him but I can't say I care to be there at his bail hearing.

Started cycling later last year as I was still unable to run due to impact pain, did \~300 miles outside before going to Zwift on Nov 1st. I have an endurance cardio background but generally weaker, fatter ,and out of shaper than I should be. 

Since Nov 1:

50 total zwift activities. 5 races.

\~1100 miles on zwift, \~50 miles cycling outside, \~50 miles running.

Starting FTP - 232 | Current - 275

Starting Vo2 - 30.1 | Current - 41.1

Starting Weight Lbs - 231 | Current 213 

  
My schedule is basically just robopacer/event rides for z2, and either ""The Ganna"" or just a route ride with self imposed intervals for hard efforts. I completed the Rapha 500, and did my first metric and imperial century in one 5 hour ride lol. Basically no drinking and my diet has been relatively clean with tons of protein. 

Initially I had no interest in the racing at all and just love the grind and gamification of Zwift. Then I did my first race and it was a blast even though I had no clue what I was doing. Each subsequent race I feel like I learned so much about the technique involved and about my own abilities. I did well enough in my most recent race and promoted to C which was my first real milestone. 

\--

I imagine there's probably a lot of people who are just now starting after the sales and new year, so the major factors I wish I would have been more mindful of when starting are: 

•I wish I would have done a race early on, in the first week or two. I was intimidated and knew I wouldn't finish well so I wanted to get stronger first. What's the point of competing if you're not gonna win right /s. It would have been nice to have another starting point metric to improve upon, and racing for me helps you find ftp limit etc more than an ftp test, the competition brings out more effort in me.

•The single biggest limiting factor to my training ability in the first monthish was saddle pain. Patience is key, its extremely frustrating when you want to workout but your taint simply can't support it. Make sure your sitting on your gooch and building strength in the proper seated form for long term success, your tailbone will not support you in the long run lol.

•I initially just picked one of the plans and tried to work through it, but gave up on like the second ride because I didn't have the fitness for it and it wasn't engaging at all. Building up a base, and most importantly enjoying Zwift as a game should come first, let your brain enjoy the xp, drops, and level grinds, unlocks, events etc. before anything else. Hours on the bike is way more crucial than a strict training plan initially. 

•I'm a lot stronger and able to hold onto higher watts for longer than I initially thought. For me specifically coming from distance running I really had a tendency to always be trying to preserve. You can push harder on the bike and recover faster. A big skillset I feel like I'm learning is to actively try to control my breathing and heartrate, even when pushing in z4+, and being as undramatic and relaxed as possible.

•Be very selective about your race events. If you're heavier, pick a flatter course, and vice versa. I had no clue how big of an advantage heavier riders have on flats and downhills, and vice versa, so use whatever your weight advantage is. Its a really, really big deal if you're trying to improve race score, as race score cares about your finishing position relative to other people. My third race I had the highest NP in the group, and finished in the middle of the pack because I picked a very hilly race and I'm a big fella.

•I wish I learned sooner how to standup and pedal without sprinting/spiking watts, during races and z2. Its a great way to get a gooch reset and shake the legs out. On longer rides, use your coffee breaks, its not cheating and its not hurting your fitness. Stand up and stretch out. Outside of a velodrome, there's nowhere in the world you can ride a bike and pedal nonstop for hours.

\--

  
I can already feel that I'm just about at the end of my noobie gains which is daunting and exciting. The grind to B is going to be much longer and harder. I've just recently been able to start doing some real running again which is great for cross training, I'm doing my first irl cycling race (a very casual gravel thing) in a few weeks, and I'm excited to work out a training plan for irl and zwift events to continue improving.

1qc0fk7,https://i.redd.it/o8t0r9hka5dg1.png,Worcester Men's Book Club Meeting!,"Hello! I was the OP for the other thread asking if there's any interest in a local men's book club ([https://www.reddit.com/r/WorcesterMA/comments/1q7o3jt/would\_anyone\_be\_interested\_in\_starting\_this\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorcesterMA/comments/1q7o3jt/would_anyone_be_interested_in_starting_this_in/)). We got a good response so I'm following up with details about what it'll be and when/where the first meeting is.

What is this?

This a men-focused book club! Most book clubs are female dominated simply because women, on average, read more than men, so this club will focus on what men want to read.

Where is this?

The club is based out of Worcester, MA, but anyone in the surrounding area is obviously welcome to join. The plan is for venues to rotate to keep things interesting, switching from libraries, coffee shops, breweries etc.

What types of books are you reading?

There is no set type or genre of book being read. What books we read each month are determined by a vote, and anyone can submit whatever they like. We do plan to have themed months (fantasy, sci-fi, classics etc) to get some variety.

What if I can't make a meeting?

That's fine! This is casual club with the focus being on connections and having fun. If you miss a month here or there, that's fine, you can always hop on next month.

When are meetings?

Our first meeting is schedule for Sunday (1/18) for 12pm at the Worcester Public Library. After that, it's TBD! The plan is to meet monthly, but details will be announced closer to the exact date. Join the Discord for more updates.

The previous one (colleague of current one) broke me when we stopped (she went on maternity leave and stopped treating afterwards). She didnt help my issues by being unclear in the boundaries and avoided a clean break...  lets be friends, oh perhaps not, oh but I'll hug you when I see you and come to my home and see my new baby... let's go for coffee... but I'll ignore your messages so we never go... but wait, there's the hug again....etc etc.... and I've suffered big time. I shared this with the new one (been with her for a year now) and she's helped me a lot. She's very clear with her boundaries and I've tried so hard not to let myself get attached (we're dealing with issues from my childhood regarding this so it's not surprising). But I'm gutted. I'm going to ruin the relationship if I can't get this sorted. 

How do I stop thinking about her and seeing her as a person who I look up to, I admire her and well basically idolise her! I dont so much think of her as a real person, I see her mainly in her role and idolise how good she is at her job and how knowledgeable, although having mother issues I do day dream about how it must be to have a mum like her / be as confident in your mother role. Neither of which I can relate to. My mother didn't want to know and I feel like I'm a rubbish mum. 

She's aware I idolise her and she calls me out on it. Tells me I'm putting myself unnecessarily below her. I'm not doing it intentionally but it's not helpful to my mental health! 

I missed her over the xmas break and it slipped out. Her response was that I hadn't missed her. I corrected myself that I'd missed the therapy sessions. Trouble is she's so good and I feel so safe and seen that I did miss that = I did miss her.

I want to be very clear I’ve never given two shits about height, until now. I’m 5’5” for reference and have always been open to dating guys who are at least my height. The guy I’m dating now is maybe 5’. Every time we hug or hold hands it’s slightly cringy for me because I feel like I hover over him and my hands are bigger than his.

Is there a way to make this work?,"TLDR; I 21F have been dating my 28M boyfriend for around 4 months (1 month long distance).I feel neglected in the relationship because our text conversations are very short (sometimes we only have sex-related chats), we rarely call and sometimes he doesn't show interest towards me. He brings up his ex a lot and makes me feell like I am being way too needy. Whenever I express my needs, he says he’ll change, but nothing really does. I really care about him and want to try to make this work, but I’m tired of feeling like I’m asking for too much.

I 21F have been dating my 28M boyfriend for around 4months (1 month long distance). Some context: we live in neighbouring countries, I met him while studying a semester abroad. At first I wasn't really looking for anything serious because I got hurt by another guy I was seeing earlier last year and because I wasn't sure long distance was for me, but over time I fell for him and we made it official.

Relevant details: he works 4 hours in the morning (9-1 in the beginning, now it's 7-11) and 4 hours in the afternoon/night (6-9) and is doing his masters, he graduates in May. He also lives with some relatives that constantly ask him for help (which also takes away some of his free time). I am still doing my bachelor's and I graduate in about 1-1.5 years.

When we lived in the same city, we saw each other around once a week (last 2 weeks 2-3 times). He did treat me nicely, was respecful, sometimes stayed with me until 4am and will give me small gifts (like coffee and such); I always tried to make sure he felt loved and respected, I gifted him a couple things and helped him when he needed help with writing his final essay. However, there were some things that made me feel he wasn't as intereseted as he said: he will frequently cancel dates last minute, he will take too long to respond to my texts or wouldn't return calls. I always gave him the benefit of the doubt because I know he's busy and tired, but it was quite frustrating for me. He never formally asked me to be his girlfriend, he just started introducing me as his girlfriend and later asked if that was okay.

When we said goodbye we both agreed that we will keep dating long distance and make effort to close the gap eventually, we talked about me moving with him once I finished my degree.

Now we have been dating long distance for 1 month and things have not been the best. Sometimes he takes way too long to respond to texts and sometimes he responds immediately but just short texts. He said we could do calls 3 times a week. But we have only called 3 times in a month and I am the only one taking initiative to organize this calls. We even got into an argument the first time because he promised to call, he forgot to do it on time, I had to call him and the call ended abruptly because apparently he ran out of battery. We talked it out and he promised to change but I haven't seen any improvement. Our text conversations are often very short, and lately many of them are mostly sex-related, which makes me feel like that’s the main reason he wants to talk to me. We haven't videocalled once.

Another issue is that I feel like he still has feelings or misses his ex. They dated for around 4.5 years and broke up 3 years ago. They were also doing long distance and he broke up with her due to toxic behavior, he told me she contacted him 2 years after they broke up to get back together but he declined. However, he talks about her often and I can't help to compare myself with her, because he said they facetimed and texted frequently, gave her flowers, visited her, etc. I understand he had more free time back then and that she lived closer to his city (we’re about 11 hours apart by car), but it still makes me feel insecure. He even told me she contacted him after seeing a picture of us together, and that he talked to her about me, which made me uncomfortable. I can’t help feeling like he loved her more than he’ll ever love me.

I’m starting to lose feelings and no longer fully believe him when he says he loves me. I don’t know if things will improve once he graduates and has more free time, or if I’m just holding onto something that isn’t working.

1qc09st,https://www.reddit.com/r/msu/comments/1qc09st/caffeine_awareness/,Caffeine awareness,"Hi everyone! A recent post about a new drink in Spartys has got me thinking about caffeine. I think in college we get really desensitized to caffeine and everybody jokes about running on no sleep. I think we should be aware that caffeine is a drug and modifies the way you function. With some of the new energy drinks out there being marketed more like dietary supplements or pop-alternatives I thought I would share some facts. 

TLDR; Try not to drink more than one energy drink in a day, especially if you're going to work out. 

According to the FDA (and this is not new RFK stuff):

1. About 400 mg per day of caffeine is the max recommended for healthy adults, with no more than 200 mg being taken at once (i.e. wait a few hours between energy drinks)

2. They recommend teens (13-18) have no more than 100 mg per day - just be aware at 19 your brain isn't much different than 18. It's not like you turn 19 then suddenly 300 mg extra per day won't negatively affect you. 

3. They do not recommend having more than 200 mg within 2 hours of hard exercise. So, slamming that energy drink before the gym might be doing you more harm than good.

In addition, keep in mind that different types of caffeine may affect you differently. Brewed coffee often has more caffeine (~95mg) than and espresso shot (~65mg) but we usually feel a buzz from the espresso. 

For anybody who thinks this is overkill or silly, remember that Panera is currently undergoing litigation around their charged lemonade. At least two people died including a 21 year old Ivy League student. 

Keep in mind caffeine is not currently regulated by the FDA - the 'big players' (i.e. Coke and Pepsi) voluntarily label their caffeine so that the FDA won't come in with a bunch of restrictions. They're playing a cat and mouse game and trying desperately not to get noticed by the cat. I think as we see more start-up brands coming out with more and more caffeine (and less and less labeling) we may see a caffeine regulation soon.

Finally, I wanted to give you an overview of common emergency drinks right now, and how much caffeine is in each one. 

Starting from the bottom:

Red Bull (8.4 oz) - 80 mg

Rockstar and Monster (16 oz) - 160 mg

Sparkling Ice + Caffeine (16 oz) - 160 mg

Celsius (12 oz) - 200 mg

5-hour energy - 200 mg

Alani (12 oz) - 200 mg

UltraDopa (new at Spartys, 12 oz) - 225 mg

Reign and Bang (16 oz) - 300 mg

When I opened my eyes again, I was back to the day Alexander discovered my sick obsession with him—my desperate need to claim him as my mate.
This time, I would crush every delusional fantasy.
My only wish was for him to find his true mate and live a long, powerful, peaceful life.
As for me… my life was a price I was willing to pay.
Chapter 1
My wolf went insane after I watched my parents take their own lives right before my eyes.
My childhood protector, Alexander, had to hold me every night.
The only thing that can soothe my wolf is Alexander's Alpha scent.
Later, Sophie, the Beta he cherished, took her own life, leaping from a bridge into the sea.
Everyone thought I had pushed Sophie into the sea, so that I could have Alexander all to myself.
The warmth Alexander once had for me was gone, replaced by an endless, desolate disappointment.
He kept whispering, ""Why... did it have to be this way?""
But when a vampire’s lethal curse came for me, he still drained his Alpha strength to take the fatal blow.
As he lay dying, he used his last ounce of strength to wipe a tear from my cheek.
""It was my fault… I spoiled you, Elena. I never should have… brought you into my pack.""
Alexander's parents, the former Alpha and Luna, called me a cursed Omega.
They said I was a calamity, that I was the one who destroyed their proud, noble Alpha son.
Consumed by regret, I went to the altar of the Moon Goddess and offered my soul.
I begged for a second chance, even if it cost me my soul's eternal peace.
When I opened my eyes again, I was back to the day Alexander discovered my sick obsession with him—my desperate need to claim him as my mate.
This time, I would crush every delusional fantasy.
My only wish was for him to find his true mate and live a long, powerful, peaceful life.
As for me… my life was a price I was willing to pay.
...
""Elena..."" His voice was a shocked whisper. ""I always thought you were so innocent. How could you… harbor these kinds of feelings for me?""
The familiar voice echoed in my ears.
Before consciousness fully returned, I felt my heart hammering under the weight of his complex Alpha scent.
I stared, stunned, at the living, breathing, powerful Alpha before me.
Tears instantly welled in my eyes.
""Say something.""
He sighed, tossing a shirt heavy with his scent over to me, covering the damning evidence.
A dark flush crept up his neck, a sign of shock and confusion.
At his feet lay a wooden box, its contents spilled across the floor—my secret hoard of items, all soaked in his scent.
It was undeniable.
My feelings for him went far beyond the bond we shared as packmates.
My wolf was sick with the need to possess him.
But right now, I didn't feel a single drop of shame for being discovered.
Instead, a wave of relief so powerful washed over me that I burst into uncontrollable sobs.
My endless nights of praying to the Moon Goddess had finally been answered.
I was reborn, sent back to the very moment Alexander discovered my dark obsession with him.
I trembled with the sheer joy of this new beginning, tears streaming down my face.
Alexander noticed something was off.
He must have thought his serious tone had terrified me.
He softened his voice, his gaze complex as he pointed at the box.
""Listen to me, Elena. Burn it."" His voice was low, laced with a soft, weary emotion. ""Just get rid of it, and we can pretend… this never happened.""
Last time he said those words, the wolf inside me had snapped.
I'd grabbed him by the collar and kissed him.
He'd stared at me, utterly shocked, before recoiling as if burned.
From that day on, he refused to be in the same room with me.
If he saw me in the manor, he avoided me like the plague.
That one forbidden kiss had shattered my last restraint, fueling my obsession.
It also deepened my hatred for Sophie, the she-wolf who had captured his attention.
And that led to all the tragedies that followed.
So this time, I wiped my tears away with the back of my hand.
I scrambled to gather the scattered items, placed them back in the box, and carried it toward the fire pit in the backyard.
""Okay.""
""I'll burn it.""
When I was seventeen, my pack was destroyed overnight.
In his despair, my father drove us—my mother and I—up a winding mountain road.
The wind howled that day, and I remember my father's bloodshot eyes as he looked at me. ""Elena, don't blame us.""
I closed my eyes, ready for the car to plunge off the cliff.
But at the last second, he shoved a Moon Goddess charm into my hand.
Then he wrenched the steering wheel, throwing me clear of the vehicle.
The next moment, the car, with my parents inside, plummeted into the ravine and erupted in a ball of fire.
I sat on the edge of the cliff for what felt like an eternity.
Until Alexander found me.
He was only five years my senior, but he already carried himself with the unshakable presence of a future Alpha.
He handled the arrangements, fending off the vultures circling to claim my father's debts.
After the funeral, I moved into Alexander's home.
But every night, nightmares consumed me.
Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that all-consuming fire.
Alexander tried everything.
He'd take me on walks under the full moon.
He would wrap me in his Alpha scent, staying by my side from dusk till dawn.
Then, one stormy night, my control finally shattered, and my wolf went feral.
I nearly tore my own throat out with my claws.
Alexander pinned me down, using his own body as a shield, letting my teeth and claws rake bloody marks across his arms, but he never let go.
That night, cocooned in his Alpha scent, I cried myself to exhaustion and finally found a peaceful sleep.
At seventeen, at eighteen, how could I resist a powerful, gentle Alpha who was so fiercely protective?
I began to collect anything that held his scent obsessively.
His shirts, his watch, even a paper bag he'd tossed aside…
Anything of his was enough to make my heart race and my wolf howl.
I prayed to grow up faster, just so I could finally confess.
But before I had the chance, the beta he loved, Sophie, killed herself by jumping into the ocean.
Everyone thought her death was my fault.
Alexander’s eyes turned to ice.
He looked at me with a gaze that held none of its former warmth, only endless disappointment and distance.
Yet when a vampire's lethal curse came for me, he still shielded me with his body without a second's hesitation.
Alexander was perfect in every way.
It’s just that his feelings for me seemed to be nothing more than an Alpha’s instinct to protect a member of his pack.
Mine was an Omega's primal craving for her mate.
In my past life, when Alexander's mother heard he had died, she collapsed on the spot.
His father pointed a shaking finger at me and roared.
""Elena, you are a calamity sent by the Moon Goddess! Will you not be satisfied until everyone who loves you is dead?!""
I remembered Alexander's last words:
""I spoiled you.""
""If only… I had never brought you into my territory.""
He regretted it.
And so did I.
I clutched the Moon Goddess charm to my chest.
They say if your prayer is sincere enough, the Goddess will answer.
I wanted to pray that in the next life, he would never meet me.
But perhaps I truly was cursed to walk alone forever.
I knelt before her statue for countless days and nights.
Until my energy was utterly depleted, and the charm in my palm began to glow faintly.
A voice, ancient and ethereal, echoed in my mind:
""What is done cannot be undone… but it can be relived.""
""You are the calamity woven into his fate. If you do not resolve it, all your efforts will be in vain.""
""Whether you repeat the tragedy or forge a new path, the choice is yours.""
When I woke, the cracked charm in my palm was proof that it was no dream.
This life, I won't make the same mistakes.
No matter the cost, I will ensure my Alpha has a life of peace and happiness.
Chapter 2
The next day, on the way to the packhouse, neither of us mentioned what had happened.
The silence in the car was strange, thick with unspoken things.
His scent was a confused, suppressed mix.
It wasn't until we got out of the car that Alexander broke the silence.
""Elena,"" he sighed, ""you attacked Sophie the other day. Scratched her face. Go and apologize to her, will you?""
His tone held no blame, only a deep exhaustion.
He clearly expected me to have another meltdown.
But I just lowered my head obediently.
""Okay.""
Alexander shot me a surprised look, but in the end, he didn't say anything else.
Once we were inside, I kept my promise and went to find Sophie to apologize.
I finally found her in the lounge with Alexander.
Amid the aroma of fresh coffee, the Beta she-wolf and the powerful Alpha were gazing at each other.
Their scents wove together, creating an intimate, fragrant bubble around them.
The next second, she caught sight of me out of the corner of her eye.
Her smile vanished, and she quickly tried to hide her still-swollen cheek with her hair.
Alexander instinctively moved to shield her with his body.
""What are you doing here?""
His voice was quiet, with a nervous edge I couldn't miss.
He'd obviously forgotten he had just ordered me to come apologize.
I couldn't really blame my Alpha for being on edge.
I was a lunatic.
My feelings for Alexander were an Omega's most primal, possessive need for a mate.
He was handsome, powerful, gentle, and kind.
Countless Omegas and Betas wanted him.
And I had used my Omega instincts to drive every single one of them away.
I had mistaken his silence for permission, his tolerance for affection.
I became more and more convinced that he had feelings for me, too.
It was just like my past life.
When a she-wolf trying to seduce him spiked his wine with charm-root, I gave myself to him to save him.
He clearly didn’t want to make mistakes in that state and kept avoiding my gaze.
But he couldn’t stop the low growls escaping his throat as he caught my scent, pulling me down with him. We spent a passionate night together.
I thought that after that, he would finally see me as his mate.
But I'd ignored the fact that it was nothing more than an Alpha's uncontrollable biological response.
If he hadn't been drugged, he wouldn't have given me a second glance.
Only Sophie was special to him.
Even ten years after her death, Alexander had never forgiven me.
I swallowed the bile rising in my throat and took a deep breath.
I faced Sophie and bowed deeply, a perfect ninety degrees.
""I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have hit you, and I never should have humiliated you in public like that.""
""Can you forgive me?""
Sophie glanced nervously at Alexander.
When he didn't object, she answered in a low voice.
""It's okay. Don't worry about it. I forgive you.""
I straightened up and met Alexander's gaze.
In his deep eyes, I saw a storm of complicated emotions I couldn't understand.
In my past life, there was another reason I hated Sophie.
I'd seen her more than once getting close to Alexander's biggest rival, another Alpha named Connor.
Connor was a vicious wolf who loved nothing more than making trouble for Alexander.
I was convinced Sophie was a pawn sent to manipulate Alexander, which was why I was so hostile towards her.
This time, no matter what the truth was, I had to find out.
I had to get these two lovers, who missed their chance in the last life, back on the right track.
So, I started sticking to Sophie, telling her how guilty I felt and that I wanted to be friends.
At first, she was wary of me.
But when she saw I genuinely meant no harm, she slowly let her guard down.
I tried to probe gently. ""So… what do you think of Alpha Alexander?""
Sophie's ears turned bright red.
""Alpha Alexander… he's so strong, but so gentle. He never gets angry with other wolves.""
""I think… he's very charming.""
Just as I thought.
The feeling was mutual.
And Sophie was truly a great match for him.
She came from a simple background but worked incredibly hard.
She was the top student at the werewolf academy, ambitious and strong-willed.
And my Alpha was handsome and powerful, heir to his family's territory and fortune, young and successful.
Anyone would call them a perfect match.
Even though I already knew this was how it was supposed to be, my heart ached with a bitter jealousy.
That evening, for the first time in a long while, Alexander knocked on my bedroom door.
He didn't dare come in.
The last time he'd barged in unannounced was when he found all my disturbing secrets.
I spoke first. ""I'm just looking at some reports for the branch office. Nothing else…""
Since my rebirth, I could feel Alexander purposefully keeping his distance.
Even without the kiss, he couldn't accept that the ""little sister"" he'd raised himself harbored a mate's desire for him.
And me, even without the kiss, I still couldn't let him go.
He cleared his throat, a little awkwardly.
""Why haven't you been riding home with me from the packhouse lately?""
I was surprised.
I didn't expect him to ask about that.
Because I need to get used to a life without you.
I nervously closed the tab with the application forms for packs in Europe and made up an excuse.
""I'm getting along really well with Sophie. We made plans to leave work together so we can chat.""
The lie felt hollow on my tongue.
Alexander stared at me, his Alpha gaze making my scalp tingle.
I lifted my chin and challenged him.
""Am I getting in your way?""
He frowned and reached out, his fingers gently brushing my forehead.
""What are you thinking? It's nothing like that.""
Then he ran a hand through his hair, looking a bit frustrated.
""Forget it. It's… probably good for you to make more friends.""
Chapter 3
That day, I left work with Sophie as usual.
She had opened up to me a lot, and I was determined to find out the real reason why she had jumped into the sea in our past life.
Everyone thought I pushed her.
Even Alexander believed it.
After all, I had a history.
But I didn't do it.
I never even touched a shred of her clothing.
She had just cried and jumped on her own.
I thought maybe something had happened with Sophie's family that made her suicidal.
""Sophie, if you're in any trouble, you have to tell me. I'll help you!""
Sophie froze for a second, then her eyes reddened.
She was in trouble.
She was just about to speak.
Suddenly, a group of rogues emerged from the shadows of the parking garage.
They looked dangerous, and they were carrying weapons.
I knew some self-defense from when I was younger, and my werewolf instincts allowed me to hold my own for a bit.
But Sophie was not doing well.
Just as a club was about to swing down on her, I didn't think twice.
I threw myself in front of her.
A sharp pain exploded in the back of my head, and my world went black.
When I woke up, the back of my head and my back were throbbing with a burning pain.
I was covered in dirt, but the scene in front of me was too shocking to process.
Sophie was lying nearby, her clothes torn, her eyes empty and vacant.
""Hey, Sophie, what happened?""
My voice was trembling.
I ignored the pain and fumbled for my phone.
I just wanted to call my Alpha.
But the screen was shattered and wouldn't turn on.
Just then, a blinding light hit my face.
I squeezed my eyes shut.
The sound of police sirens mixed with Alexander's furious roar.
A powerful wave of his Alpha scent rooted me to the spot.
I watched him rush past, his entire being radiating pain and despair.
""Elena..."" His voice was a raw, broken whisper. ""I thought you were better... How could you... do this?""
His eyes were red with anguish, his Alpha presence chaotic and overwhelming from his loss of control, making it hard to breathe.
I stared at him, confused, before it slowly dawned on me.
He had it all wrong.
He thought I… He thought I did this to her.
""Alex, no… it wasn't me.""
Alexander swept Sophie up into his arms.
He didn't even look at me again, just growled, ""Delete what's on your phone. Wait for me at the manor.""
His voice was low, suppressing a volcano of emotion.
I watched his retreating back, my vision blurring with tears.
""It really… wasn't me…""
Finally, all my strength drained away, and the world faded to black again.
I dreamed of my past life, of Alexander looking at me with that same cold fury after Sophie's fall.
I was at the police station for questioning.
That was the first time Alexander ever released his true, hostile Alpha command on me.
That invisible pressure shattered my heart more than any slap ever could.
""How could you do something like this…""
""I'm so disappointed in you.""
""I wish I had never brought you into our pack.""
His eyes held a chilling calm that was born from the deepest grief.
I couldn't blame him.
After all, on the rooftop that day, it was just me and Sophie.
No one would believe that a promising Beta with a bright future would just fall into the ocean for no reason.
But even though Alexander didn't believe me…
He still got me the best lawyer.
There were no cameras installed by the seaside, no direct evidence that I had pushed Sophie.
They couldn't find my fingerprints on her.
The pack council even considered the possibility that I had used dark magic to compel her to jump.
In the end, her death was ruled an accident.
Alexander paid a huge sum of money to Sophie's mother.
But she still came to our packhouse every day to cause a scene.
So, after it was all over in my past life, Alexander disbanded the pack.
He donated our entire fortune to charity to atone for what he believed was my sin.
Then he moved with me back to the old family estate in the north.
I had ruined his life.
Without me, he would have had a brilliant future.
No matter what anyone else thought…
To Alexander, the Omega he brought home had killed the woman he loved.
From that day on, nothing could ever be the same.
I jolted awake, staring up at the familiar bedroom ceiling.
Thank Moon Goddess, I was reborn. It was a chance to start everything over.
Alexander was sitting by my bed, looking exhausted, with dark circles under his eyes.
When he saw I was awake, a flicker of light returned to his eyes.
Then he pulled me into a hug, holding me tightly, so tightly.
Chapter 4
It turned out Sophie had woken up before I did.
She told him everything that had happened.
That I was only knocked out because I was trying to save her.
The men who attacked us took pictures of her and then ran off.
Alexander held me, his body trembling slightly.
He buried his face in the crook of my neck, his voice hoarse and full of regret. ""I'm so sorry, Elena. I'm so sorry.""
""I was wrong... I was wrong about you.""
""I didn't protect you, and then I accused you without even knowing the truth...""
He was shaking, and the warmth of his Alpha scent wrapped around me, making my own eyes burn.
All the pain and frustration of the past few days burst out of me at once.
I buried my face in his expensive shirt, smearing tears and snot all over it.
""Alex! It's all my fault!"" I cried, gasping for breath. ""If I hadn't been so awful in the past, you would have had a reason to believe me!""
I shook my head desperately, wanting him to believe me.
""I was so wrong. I'll never cling to you again, I'll never make things hard for you!""
""I won't wish for you to be my mate anymore. I'll be good. I'll be your pack sister. We'll always be family. I promise.""
I felt Alexander's body go rigid for a second.
Then, his hand started gently patting my back.
We stayed like that, holding each other for a long, long time.
It felt like all the walls between us had finally crumbled away.
Alexander picked up the bowl of soup from the nightstand and began to feed me, one spoonful at a time.
""Eat something first.""
He tucked my hair behind my ear and grabbed his jacket.
""I'm going out to buy you those moon-shaped cakes you love,"" he said, his gaze as soft and deep as a forest pool.
""When I get back, I have something important I want to tell you.""
I watched him go, a strange feeling washing over me.
Something about him seemed different.
Like he'd made a very important decision.
But I waited for a long time, and my Alpha didn't come back.
Instead, I got a text message.
It was from Sophie.
[Elena, please, I'm begging you. Meet me at the bridge.]
[You have to come alone.]
[Please…]
I bolted out the door, my heart pounding.
Why?
Why was this still happening?
The Moon Goddess's words echoed in my head.
What has happened cannot be undone.
Did that mean I couldn't change anything?
Then what was the point of being reborn?
But this message… it was different from the one she sent last time.
In the last life, her text was a taunt. She lied and said she and Alexander were having a secret meeting.
But this time was different.
I felt like the truth was finally within my reach.
On the bridge, the sea wind howled. Sophie stood on the other side of the railing, her face streaked with tears, just like last time.
""Sophie, what the hell are you doing?!""
Did she really have to throw herself into this ocean?!
Sophie looked at me and dropped to her knees on the narrow ledge.
""Elena, I'm trapped… The rogues who attacked us were sent by Alpha Connor. He used blood magic to bind me. I'm as good as dead.""
My blood ran cold.
""If you knew that, why didn't you go to the Pack Enforcers! You're the victim, you did nothing wrong!""
Sophie screamed, already on the verge of a complete breakdown.
""It's useless, Elena!""
""I fought back, but it was useless…""
""They're threatening my mother and my pack. Connor's pack is too powerful; we can't fight him.""
""He's a monster. He's been playing with all of us. He wants to destroy Alexander, so he's starting with you.""
""I'm so sorry. You and Alpha Alexander were so good to me. Don't come any closer! As long as you don't touch me, they won't find your fingerprints or scent on me.""
""Alexander cares about you so much. He'll find a way to protect you. But if I don't do what Connor says, my pack will be destroyed. If I die, maybe it will be a big enough scandal to expose him.""
""All I ask is that after I'm gone, you'll look after my family… for the sake of our short friendship.""
I lunged forward, jumping after her the instant she fell, reaching for her.
A raw, desperate scream tore from my throat, nearly swallowed by the wind.
""Do you have any idea what will happen to Alex if you die?! He'll be in pain for the rest of his life!""
I wouldn’t let that tragedy happen again!
I gave it my all and pulled Sophie up with all my strength, even dislocating both my wrists in the process.
The next second, the Moon Goddess amulet around my neck slipped free, hitting the ground with a faint clink.
A flash of light erupted, shattering it into a dozen pieces.
She was saved.
This time, it was different.
As I watched the fragments hang in the air, it all clicked.
If I were the curse in Alexander’s fate… then without me, he could finally be happy, couldn’t he?
…So that was it.
I finally understood. This was the meaning of the Moon Goddess.
From the edge of the bridge, Sophie watched in horror as I fell, reaching for me, frantic to help.
But I just smiled.
“So,” I whispered, “if I just disappear, everything will be all right. Won’t it?”
My wolf didn't howl.
It was as calm as I was, accepting our fate.
I climbed over the railing and let myself fall into the abyss.
My Alex… this time, you have to be happy.
---
Alexander's POV
Across the street, buying Elena’s favorite cakes, Alexander's heart seized.
It was a sharp, tearing agony that ripped through the core of his wolf, a pain from the deepest part of his soul.
The box fell from his hands, the cakes scattering on the pavement.
He didn't bother to pick them up.
He snapped his head up, his eyes fixed on the bridge.
His Alpha instincts were screaming, a desperate, unprecedented alarm.",1,1768331428.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I run a small, boutique dog training business called Sit Pretty Co. in Apopka, and I’m looking for a part-time kennel tech / dog handler to help me as my client load continues to grow.

This is not a big facility or corporate kennel — dogs stay in my home or I work with them in their own homes and out in the real world (parks, trails, coffee shops, etc.). If you love dogs and want hands-on experience with training, this is a really fun environment.

What you’d be helping with:
	•	Handling and supervising dogs for potty time in the yard.
	•	Helping with pack walks and outings
	•	Light cleaning (crates, bowls, laundry, etc.)
	•	Assisting during training


Schedule:
Very flexible — typically 10–20 hours per week, weekdays and some Saturdays depending on bookings. I can be very flexible on part time availability if you work another job.

Who this is perfect for:
	•	Dog lovers
	•	Students or people between jobs or needing extra work.
	•	Anyone interested in dog training, pet care, or animal behavior
	•	People who want a flexible, active job instead of sitting at a desk

No professional dog experience required — I’m happy to train the right person. You just need to be reliable, comfortable handling multiple dogs, and genuinely enjoy being around them.
Also willing to hire/train this position for a full time training position as I grow my business this year.

If this sounds like your vibe, email me at Abby@sitprettyco.com with a short intro about yourself, a resume, why your think you would be a good fit, and your availability.

Thank you!

1qc03en,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1qc03en/unresolved_trauma_led_to_an_emotional_attachment/,Unresolved trauma led to an emotional attachment,"Hi everyone!

I'm a 23-year-old man, and I'm writing here because this is something I can't share with anyone in my real life. I also can't affor therapy at the moment, so I'm hoping that writing this out might help me process things.

I want to start from the roof of my pain.

When I was a child, my mother had to leave for a period of time, and I live with my father. This happened multiple times over several years. When I was 4 or 5 years old, I experienced se\*ual abuse from him. I don't want to go into details, but it happened more than once during the years. The last time when I was 12. In the meantime my parents got divorced I was forced to visit him by my country laws, and during that visit he again crossed boundaries. I realized what was happening, escaped, and never looked back.

That experience shaped a lot of things in me. From that point on, I felt attraction to both men and women. With men, the attraction was sexual and almost always towards much older men. With women, it was more emotional and aesthetic.

I come from a Europan country where homophobia is still very present. Being ""Different"" can make you a target. At 16, two girls in my high school discovered things I was looking at, and I expereinced serious bullying afterward.

Later, I met my current girlfriend in other city. We've been together for four years, living together, and we have a genuinely healthy, loving relationship. She is the person I love the most in the world. We've built a stable life together.

The problem started last summer.

My father called me out of nowhere. We had minimal contact over the years, but during that call he told me I was a mistake, that I should never been born, that my mother left him because of me. He had said hurtful things before, but this time it reopened something deep inside me.

Old memories came back. Nightmares started. Flashbacks. The attraction to older men intensified. I started falling apart internally , and I told no one.

By October, I was at my lowest point. My girlfriend noticed something was wrong, but I wasn't ready to explain. And then I made a bad decision.  
I created a secret Facebook profile just to find someone I could talk to. That's how I met a man from France. He is 57, gay, lives alone. From the first day, we talked constantly. He entered my life like someone sent by fate.

At first, it was purely emotional support and friendship. He didn't see me sexaully, and that made me feel safe. For the first time in my life, an older male figure fully accept me. I slowly fell in love with him. We agreed clearly: no relationship, just friendship. But boundaries blurred. Hearts, affectionate messages, pictures. I responded the same way. This went on for three months.

During Christmas, he took on extra work and became unavailable. That triggered my anxeity badly. I missed him. I leaned on him emotionally while still being in a relationship with my girlfriend, who had no idea I was living a double life interanlly.

I have an anxious attachment style, and this man unconsciously became the emotional anchor I never had growing up. After Christmas the energy shifted. I panicked. Two weeks ago, we talked and agreed to limit contact to weekends ONLY. This past weekend, we spoke on Saturday, but on Sunday he said he couldn't talk - he had a terrible day and no energy. Eventually, he still called me, and we had a nice conversation. It was one of the best so far (that night).

The next morning, I woke up blocked everywhere. I panicked and messaged his phone number. He replied immediately, apologized and later explained that he blocked me because he had ""met someone"" from official work during Christmas (not extra work) and didn't know how to tell me, knowing I had feelings for him. He thought disappearing would hurt less. We talked for hours and hours, I completely broke down.

The truth is: I never wanted to fall in love. But I allowed boundaries to be crossed. I gave too much and expected too much in return. He is nearly 60, emotionally experienced and stable. I am still figuring myself out.

I decided to deactive my profile and stop contact until I can stabilize myself. We both agreed that that is the best decision at the moment. I still want him in my life as a friend - he is kind, intelligent, emotinally aware. I truly value him.

Part of me believes he told me about ""someone else"" because he felt overwhelmed and needed distance. He has always said he enjoys being alone, doesn't want relationships and avoids dating apps. I don't know the full truth, and I'm trying not to cling to any narrative just to feel better. I want to include that his free days are only weekends and during them he spoke to me everytime. I think that he was unable to put boundaries and he decided to make up the story about ""someone"" so I can de-attach slowly , but still wants me as a friend.  
He really valued me a lot and always was honest to me. I think he didn't expect that I will deactivate the profile.

What hurts the most is that he was the first person who loved and accepted the hidden part of me - the part shaped by trrauma. Losing that feels like a breakup, even though nothing officialy existed.

I was also supposed to travel there next month. Part of that trip was about meeting him for a coffee. That won't happen now and I lost the joy to go there. (Trip is already booked).

I know I crossed emotional boundaries. I know I should have protected my primary relationship better. I'm carrying guilt, grief, confusion and relief at once. Since deactivating that profile and deleted all reminders of him , I do feel lighter - but the pain is still there. It feels like mourning someone.

I'm sharing this because no one knows my sexuality. No one knows what I'm going through. I'm deeply emotional and I love intensely. I just needed somewhere safe to say this out loud.

I was in a dark place and am now reminded why I'm not drinking anymore.

Today I feel:  
\- Nauseous, I can barely drink my coffee. I feel bloated.  
\- I can't focus at work.  
\- My body hurts.  
\- I slept through my alarm and woke to chaos with my wife scrambling to get the kids ready and everyone is frustrated.  
\- I feel guilt and shame over it, my wife called at lunch to check with me (I'm grateful). She noticed I was very quiet and depressed.

Reaffirmation to **stop** drinking:  
\- I physically feel drastically better, even if my emotions aren't there yet (I'm seeing a therapist to help with this).  
\- No guilt over drinking, no sneaking around.  
\- No bloating, dry bloodshot pale face.  
\- Even after a week and a half I noticed my face was slimming down, my body even looked less wide. 

Sobriety is tough. I don't feel like there's any mental ""reset"" (aka oblivion), but I felt drastically better even if my mood wasn't quite there. Meditation, mindfulness, treating cozy bed-time as the reward for a hard day is important. I want to go back there, drinking isn't worth it.

I am a man who finds as much resonance in a Byron soliloquy as I do in a heavy session at the gym. My interests are broad ...from the complexities of Indian federalism and history to the raw, amateur soul of making music. I’m looking for a woman who is my intellectual and emotional equal, someone I can vibe with over Bengali poetry or fitness goals.

I am a composed man in my public life, but I believe that a truly deep connection should be built on absolute honesty and a bit of a bittersweet edge. I’m looking for a slow-burn, ""friends-to-lovers"" journey where our bond is the anchor for everything else we explore.

The Connection:

I’ve always felt that the most intense relationships are those where there is a certain level of vulnerability and uninhibited trust. I want to be the man who truly knows your heart...the one you share your day with, your music with, and your secrets with. I am drawn to the complex, intense dynamic of cuckolding, where I am your primary partner and sanctuary, yet find a visceral, possessive thrill in seeing you explore your desires with others. I want to be the one who welcomes you back, hears the details, and shows you exactly why I’m the one you chose to keep.

What I’m Looking For:
Intellectual Spark: Someone to discuss Manfred in the morning or debate politics over coffee.
Shared Growth: Whether it's gym progress or dabbling in new poetry, I want to grow alongside you.
Emotional Depth: I value the bittersweet feeling of being the one you always come home to. I want to be the person who hears everything about your experiences and loves you more for it.

I’m a ""winner"" in my public life, but I want to be the one who listens and understands you in private. If you’re a woman who isn't afraid to be herself and wants a partner who can match your mind and your spirit, I’d love to connect.

If we were to trade favorite poems or songs tonight, which one would tell me the most about who you really are?",1,1768330775.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

Hello beautiful Missoula folks! Come meet the Disco Carrot up at Marshall Mountain on Friday! We'll be pumping tunes 1PM - 6:30 PM.

**Launch of Disco Carrot Phase 1**

After countless hours of designing and fabricating, we're finally ready to unveil our snow-worthy creation. What is Disco Carrot? We're glad you asked.

We've transformed a vintage snowcat into a mobile DJ booth, complete with a custom-built enclosure, Void Acoustic sound system, and lighting that'll make the mountains glow. This Friday marks the completion of Phase 1 and serves as a fundraiser to help us finish what we've started.

  
**Fundraiser Raffle**

Bring cash! We'll have several items to raffle:

* Pair of tickets to Downing Mountain Lodge (private backcountry ski and split board lodge)
* Pair of tickets to that night's show at the Top Hat
* Subscription to Bomb Snow Magazine
* Swag bag from our sponsors
* Swag bag from FunkitCoffee and Thrift

**The Vision**

Our long-term design for the snowcat is a large Jackalope equipped with antlers, ears, and an 8ft disco tiled carrot dangling from a crane above its head. It's our tribute to everything we love about Montana, Missoula, the mountains, recreation, and the pursuit of that magical carrot that keeps us all chasing our dreams.

**Where We're Headed**

Designed for snowy terrain and alpine dreams, Disco Carrot will bring the beat to the mountains—from après-ski parties at base lodges to pumping up early risers in first chair lines, summit lodge throwdowns, full-moon cross-country ski gatherings, and major events like the X Games and Tomorrowland Winter. When summer arrives, we'll shift gears for music festivals and mountain bike events.

**Yeah, but why?**

We're local Missoulians, so it's important to us that this first launch coincides within Montana, and what better place than Marshall Mountain! This project merges our passion for mountain adventure with our love for music and art, showcasing the unique creative spirit that emerges from Montana's peaks and valleys. Born in these mountains, Disco Carrot is a love letter to alpine adventure, underground music culture, and the wild art that grows where the snow falls deep and the bass hits harder.

Join us Friday to celebrate Phase 1, dance to DJ’s 9B49, Jenn ‘N Juice, Suka, BKLove, Party Robbins and help fuel the dream. All are welcome—bring your energy and your dancing shoes (or winter boots) :)

We’re cruising from the mountain to the club and we hope you’ll join us for the journey.

YeEDM continues at the Top Hat 10pm with touring artists

9B49 & Jenn n Juice

Come dance in the mountains, support the build, and climb into the night with us!

SPECIAL THANKS to our sponsor LPC montana for helping bring Disco Carrot to Marshall Mountain!!

It has been years since I've last travelled properly abroad and decided to take some time off work and reserve flights to Greece and back in mid-March. Greece is probably still busy when it comes to tourists even off-season like this but at least it shouldn't be super hot! Due to the scarcity of my travelling history, I feel slightly lost on what to do and how to plan my trip. I'm travelling together with my partner and we'd like to plan a nice, scenic and easy-going trip. We're from Helsinki, Finland, if that makes any difference.

  
We will arrive and depart in Athens, and we're able to spend one full week in Greece. Leaving Athens after a day or two is definitely an option and we're wondering what would be the nicest places to visit? I got actually somewhat anxious after scrolling through Reddit on the Athens vs Thessaloniki discourse and having everyone talk trash about Athens. Have people travelled there with wrong expectations or would we better off travelling away from Athens during that week? I read that there are probably some truly sketchy neighbourhoods but maybe some nice ones also?

  
We have no interest in massive tourist attractions and we are not planning on any sort of spa holiday. I personally enjoy photography, walking and hiking (running a half marathon in Greek countryside sounds like a very pleasant thing). Idea of road tripping or travelling with a train sounds enjoyable too but car rental and driving culture differences make me slightly nervous. Maybe I'm just chasing the serene mood of the Greek film Landscape in the Mist? I'm wondering if smaller countryside towns are as quiet and sleepy as they are here in Finland and if English is usable language in communication even in smaller cities. I also enjoy good coffee (you know, the pour-over drip coffee type character) - is the coffee culture somewhat similar to Turkey or different? 

Any tips for vegan or vegetarian restaurants or dishes will be greatly appreciated. I work with music and the arts, so let me know if there are any interesting museums, music venues or record stores that I should pay attention to. Not interested in drinking, beaches, nightclubs (unless they play gooood music with a proper sound system). And obviously avoiding tourist traps and such.

Also love a Vanilla Coke Spider so thought the creaminess would be nice. 

But fuck me dead that was the worst drink I’ve ever had I don’t think I’ve ever had less than 3 sips of anything in my life but couldn’t bare any more. The coconut flavour is so fake it tasted like plastic and dirt and left a gritty feel in my mouth. If the coconut flavour wasn’t advertised I would never have guessed that was the flavour. 

And I really didn’t expect the cream component to be actual crappy American style coffee creamer? I saw the girl pour the “Avoset” shit in and my expectations plummeted 🤣 
Palm oil and lactic acid powder yum… 

Probably giving too much credit to a fast food joint but both HJ’s and Maccas make huge deals about their great coffee, that really would warrant using real cream in it?

Basically I've never touched grass in the recent past (NEET prep is that you?) and ever since I stepped into Med school, I've turned into a creepy dude magnet. Yeah. Like Tf.

I started crushing on a cute guy right on the first day and he turned out to be a... nevermind. I knew he was wayyy too out of my league. And it hurt. A lot. But I didn't cry over him. Because just when I was entering my emo phase, this other GUY stepped in. 

Let's call him Matcha.

Matcha is also in my class, so I'd obviously talked to him before during dissection. In fact, I always used to think ""this guy is so annoying"" because I THOUGHT HE WAS. And when I was heartbroken over my previous crush, I was still working on some stuff assigned by my seniors. 

I had to work with HIM.

And we started talking on phone once fine day. We talked for hours together and it had nothing to do with work. We talked about everything, from our favourite TV shows to his dead turtle, from sports to politics all night long. 

And the next day in college?

He just waved at me. 

Normal right?

That evening, he texted me again and we talked again. And the next day? We talked on call till 1 am. He kept flirting with me.

And this was when I started getting attached because...yeah I'm dumb asf.

I always felt weird how he always texted me but never talked in real life. And it's not even like he's shy, he's literally the golden retriever guy. He doesn't text any other girl by the way.

And we didn't text for a week.

I was really hurt, I know it's embarassing but i just couldn't bring myself to get over it.

And then he texted me again, asking how my day was. Ghosted me again for two days. Then texted again continuously for two days.

Heck, he even asked me out for coffee. And I said yes non committally, but the next day in college? Nothing happened.

I’m genuinely looking for advice here. This is a throwaway account because I feel embarrassed. I’ll try to give enough context so my situation makes sense.

I’m m27. I had a difficult childhood and was emotionally neglected by my parents. I live quite isolated and tend to put a lot of energy into other people. I’m often described as very helpful, kind, and having a good heart.

I’d like to believe I don’t act with selfish intentions. At the same time, I’m aware that being very nice is partly a coping mechanism. I want to be liked and accepted. Still, I also believe that a big part of me genuinely likes being kind and generous. For example, sometimes I give a barista 20€ and ask them to pay it forward for the next person’s coffee. I donate part of my income to charity without expecting anything in return. I buy food for homeless people when I can.

The problem is that I think I might be overdoing it. I feel like my kindness sometimes pressures people or makes them uncomfortable. I honestly don’t know where the line is. How nice is okay, and when does it become too much?

Here are a few situations that really confused me. I’d like to understand if I did something wrong, because I can’t explain why I was ghosted.

**Scenario 1: Friendship**

I had a friend. We weren’t extremely close, but we got along well. She helped me with a charity event. She bought supplies, helped organize things, and spent a lot of time on it. Overall, she probably invested around ten hours, so it was real work.

After the event, I wrote her a thank you note and put 120€ inside. To me, this felt fair and appreciative. I gave it to her in person after the event took place. After that, she stopped responding completely. What confuses me is that she still likes my Instagram stories sometimes.

**Scenario 2: Ghosted by charities**

After donating to an animal shelter, I asked them for some documents I needed for tax purposes. They told me they would take care of it, and they had done this for others before. Then they stopped replying.

I also donated 5000€ to an organization in Ukraine. They were very thankful and kind at first. Since I own a small web agency, I offered to redesign their website for free because I genuinely cared about what they were doing. They were excited in the beginning, but once I started planning and getting more concrete, they stopped responding as well.

If they didn’t want to move forward, that’s fine. But after donating that amount, I expected at least a clear answer. I’m confused why this keeps happening.

These are just a few examples, but situations like this occur again and again.

Because of this, two things happened.

First, I’ve developed trust issues. I avoid getting close to new people because I’m afraid of being ghosted again. I consciously limit time with new friends to protect myself from getting hurt.

Second, I know I probably need to work on being less nice, but I genuinely don’t know how much is too much. Was giving my friend 120€ inappropriate? Was offering a free website redesign too much?

I’ve reflected a lot and realized that my kindness is partly driven by the wish to be liked and accepted. But another part of me simply wants to be generous in a healthy, non-toxic way. I don’t know how to balance that.

I don’t want people to feel pressured. At the same time, I don’t want to suppress who I am. I genuinely enjoy helping others.

This becomes especially difficult in dating. I recently lost contact with a girl I was seeing because I forced myself to act „not nice“ in a situation out of fear that she might feel pressured otherwise. She cut contact shortly after. I won’t go into details here because that would be a post on its own.

I feel like I’m having some kind of identity crisis. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be hurt so much anymore. But I also don’t want to isolate myself.

Husband 34M does not see my struggles,"[](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/?f=flair_name%3A%22Need%20to%20talk...%22)Like the title says, I am 31F. I am 4.5 months pregnant with our second, I work full time and have a 17 month old baby who is in daycare. My husband is such a fantastic dad and truly does his part in our home and with child rearing. He changes diapers, does most of the cooking dinners and cleans the kitchen. My biggest issue is this: I do all of the planning, literally almost all of it for anything we need to do.I do most of the cleaning (think bathrooms, laundry, making sure to mop and run the robot vac. I grocery shop weekly to restock the house on supplies, I navigate daycare closures, wake up early with the baby, take off of work to stay home if baby is sick. I also plan any social events, book the stays for any trips we take and make an itinerary, I pack my own bag and all the supplies for the baby. I also keep up on home services, medications that we need to refill for us or our baby. Getting up in the morning is like a circus. I have to feed our dogs, get the babies milk ready, fix my coffee, pack our lunches and load them up in my car all before getting our child changed and dressed for the day. My husband often ignores his alarms, then he will snooze while i'm getting my teeth brushed and myself dressed. He will mosey down the stairs after taking forever to get up and dressed, at that point he only has to make his coffee because ive done everything else

I love planning and executing things. I think my problem is that when I do plan something with our friends, my husband chimes in with a negative response after I have already put in time and effort to look at places to eat/stay/do.

My mom recently passed away. She came to the USA from Western Samoa in the 80s, and had me in 1990. I have not spent a significant portion of my life with my Samoan family because traveling to them takes about two days, which is a considerable distance. I've only been there twice in my lifetime. My mom was so so proud to be Samoan, but our lives didn't intersect enough in a way for me to understand a great deal about our people, her people. 

I have two state-side family members that I know of, who I'm connecting with, but they live in Maine and Los Angeles. I'm looking to connect with other Samoan people to learn a bit more about my culture + history to help tell the story of my mom's life and who we are collectively at her memorial in February.

This might be a lengthy explanation, but I want to get as much detail out there.

I'm a 30yr old Italian Canadian that was raised only speaking English. Parents were born in Canada so teaching me Italian was never a priority for them. As a child, my exposure to the language and culture came primarily from my grandparents. Italian TV, Music, Food etc was ingrained in my life despite a very limited understanding of the language as a kid. Fast forward to university, my understanding of the language and immersion into the culture naturally increased. BUT still a limited understanding. I end up taking a beginner Italian course in university for a semester covering the alphabet and numbers to regular/irregular verb conjugations and simple tenses. After that course, my comprehension and language ability increased to the point of simple sentences formation and basic conversations. If i were to place my level of comprehension out of 10 give it a 4/10 at that point. After that semester there was no more classes that I signed up for, so the formal lessons effectively ended there.

Fast forward to today, and I'm still immersed with music, tv, soccer, culture, and my grandparents, so I feel like I have a strong base to become fluent. I want to finally commit to fluency, achieving a conversational level where I can be comfortable in Italy. I'm thinking of using a combination of YouTube (Lucrezia, LearnAmo etc), podcasts like CoffeeBreak Italian, and potential apps that are not Duolingo. Formal lessons become difficult with the free time I have, so I'm willing to use immersion apps like HelloTalk to get that conversation element. I won't entirely rule out online tutors, they are more of a last resort for me.

With this explanation, how long do you think it will take to achieve Italian fluency? If possible, include the difference between my method, and formal instruction via tutor. Thank you all so much for taking the time to read this longwinded explanation. I'm really looking forward to starting this journey.",1,1768330176.0,learnitalian,2,1.0,False

So far my understanding is it's hot, dry, and windy most of the year, then it's cold, dry, and windy with the occasional rainstorm that floods everything. the metroplex is pretty large for where it is and has a lot of great chains like Costco, HEB, and a new Bass Pro/fight club (even though there's no water I guess boats are a thing too?). The infrastructure is made for a population 1/3 the size but the O&G monoculture tends to ebb and flow throughout the year with larger industry-wide fluctuations (currently in a dip?). Bc of this rent goes up and down a lot and even now I see apartments like $300 cheaper than when I started looking 2 months ago. Overall there seems to be a really pervasive negative rhetoric about Midessa but I'd like to think there's redeeming qualities :).

I have a couple questions I'll list below and if any of y'all can speak to them in part or in full I'd be greatly appreciative! 

* Water: you CAN drink it but not recommended? Do apartments/restaurants/businesses use RO filters or is that a thing you need to do yourself. Also is it cheaper to just buy jugs or RO filter? Showerhead stuff?
* I hear it smells really bad and theres trash everywhere, but I visited and it seemed ok. Like it's no environmentalist Mecca but not as bad as I thought. Is it like a seasonal thing or just day to day? Also do y'all recommend air filters for your place?
* I've heard the North Loop is like the best place to be around and generally North is better/safer/more expensive/newer. Any apartment recs? I've heard ReNew is bad.
* What are some good local businesses! I've looked at the meat markets, coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and they all seem really unique and I'm glad local biz can coexist with the chains.
* So I'd LIKE a truck, but do I NEED one? (road condition, safety) Truck culture seems to go hand in hand with O&G.
* Maybe I'm just from a small town, but I don't get the ""there's nothing to do"" people. I've seen golf courses, gun ranges, bars, gyms, and tons of businesses to go to. Are they not good or something?
* Is there anything you wish you new before coming here that you wouldn't have thought to ask about?
* Are the people nice? I've head they're super nice, cold to outsiders, super religious, workaholics, etc. its it like a cultural thing here. Everyone I met was very nice, normal, and welcoming; they were a big part of why I wanted to come out to Midland!
* Lastly, how do y'all feel about the direction of Midland! I've heard it's awful and nobody wants to invest all the money, but I've seen a lot of cool new developments too. Oil seems to be really cheap right now and layoffs are happening, and the whole Venezuelan thing was a curveball I don't know how it will impact the oil biz. Y'all think its temporary or just a lull. Also Data-centers are a thing here I guess?

Despite the apparent negativity, I'm excited by the novelty of moving here, even if things don't work out long-long term. Looking forward to moving out!",5,1768330044.0,Midessa,8,1.0,False

I recently got a Baratza ESP since my old grinder was dying and don't think was even good enough for Moka Pots (how l usually make coffee). I went with the ESP in case I ever decided to get into espresso machines.

Quetions: was this a good price or should hold out for a sale on the plus? I don't want to get into the $1000s and realistically will never mod the machine, so I think it's between the plus and regular bambino, and I didn't want to do full manual. I also have limited counter space since it's already cluttered.

What budget friendly accessories would you suggest I start with to get the most out of the machine? I have the grinder recommended often here.

I also keep up on home services, medications that we need to refill for us or our baby.  Getting up in the morning is like a circus.

I write to you now after I cut every single tie that connected me to you.

I unfollowed you, unfollowed all your friends whom I followed only to know more about you. I stopped visiting your shop, and I stopped searching for any nonsensical hope that would reassure me that you were interested in me, or that I was pleasant to your eyes.

I stopped relying on illusions—ChatGPT, tarot readings, astrology, etc.  
I even brought friends to your shop just so they could come back and say *“He smiled when he saw you!”*

It wasn’t really a smile, more of a smirk—the kind that already knows it’s winning، yet I still held onto it. It was comforting.

I always wanted to cut you out of my life. I tried many times and failed.  
But this time, I’m more determined.

A close friend of mine, who happens to be a life coach, offered to help me as long as I was truly committed.

Since I started my healing journey two months ago, I completely disappeared from your scene.  
I stopped visiting your shop. I used to be there four to six times a week.  
You weren’t used to seeing me that often, but your staff and business partner were.  
And now, I’m simply gone.

I still think of you.  
But I fight the urge to walk near your shop or check your accounts.  
I think I’ve made real progress.  
I was proud of myself for choosing my mind, even when my heart wanted the opposite.

Until today.

I decided to take myself on a solo date at a small bakery eight kilometers away from your store.  
My heart wanted to visit your place it had been two months but I stuck to my self-discipline plan.

I had breakfast, afternoon tea, and was already having my late coffee when I looked at the door and saw you.

You were walking into the same bakery I escaped to..  
the place I chose to hide from you, to rebuild my solo-date routine away from your world.

I was startled enough not to react. I looked back at my computer while you walked to the cashier.  
Then I realized you weren’t a customer.

You were the owner’s friend.

She was confident. More confident than me.  
Fit. Within a “normal” BMI range.  
She dealt with you with a level of ease and confidence that couldn’t exist if she had a crush on you.

When I noticed that, I remembered a conversation I had two weeks ago with a stranger.  
I showed her the previous unsent letter I wrote to you. Then I showed her a video of you.

She said, *“Lucky him.”*

“Why?” I asked.

She replied, *“For having someone as kind as you like him. He’s so lucky. You are too much for him.”*

I always needed to hear this, yet I never said it out loud to anyone.  
Hearing it from a stranger—with no context, no attachment—was healing.

That’s why I didn’t fall apart today when I saw you.

You have everything that gives you access to visually pleasant women—  
women rich in life experience and adventure.

But among all the women you may come across in your life,  
you will never find someone like me.

I’m sorry for your loss,  
even though you’re not aware of it.

Better, I think, to ask how? How do you want to live? For me, that question demands a well designed answer. 

In the mornings, I slowly awaken with a hot cup of coffee in a handmade wonky mug in the sunroom surrounded by my plants.  I usually reserve this time for introspection, sprinkled with some inspirational reading to set my mind right for the day ahead. 

When I’m in the garden or patio watering  my plants, we all enjoy listening to Teddy Pendergrass. (Over the years, I’ve tried other artists and genres but my plants really grow to his lovemaking music.) Weekday evenings, I like to unwind by making a healthy-ish dinner and fruits for dessert. I like having books around me and bound paper for scribbles or notes. Colored pencils and makers are also nearby. You never know when inspiration will strike. 

In the cold weather, I bring out furs and drape them over the furniture and as rugs for the floor. In the summer, towels are everywhere because the pool becomes the main attraction. There is always reggae music playing, iced coffee on demand, and proteins and vegetables in the smoker for a multi sensory experience. And as far as I’m concerned, there is no how to do this life without a dog nearby.

I work from home, an accounting firm. Pays good. I enjoy it. But look, this is all going to be very strange but I need to say something.

I’ve lived in **\[̲̅E̲̅\]\[̲̅R̲̅\]\[̲̅O̲̅\]\[̲̅R̲̅\]** for a little over three years now. I moved here because the cost of living in this part of **█░█░█░█** is incredibly low.

The town itself is a totally normal, small town, maybe a couple thousand people or so, more during the summer. It’s one of those forested, lake towns. That people visit for vacations. If I drive five minutes down the road to the grocery store or the local bar, there are people there. I go to the same gym and diner as everyone else. It’s a nice, quiet small town. But the second I turn onto **▓▒▓▒▓▒** Drive, it’s like I’ve crossed a border into a ghost town.

The weird thing is, my neighborhood is finished—dozens of houses—think classic americana, town houses lined up nearly identical, save for some paint colors but I am the only resident. No 'For Sale' signs, no moving trucks, and most importantly, no neighbors. It’s just me and about forty empty houses.

I mean no one. No kids playing in the street. No bonfires at night. No fireworks on the 4th. Never any lights on. It’s so odd. Not a single person in my neighborhood. Even during Halloween no one came to my neighborhood. 

Well sorry, I guess there are ‘people’. The reason I’m posting is because the city maintenance here is so weirdly consistent. Even though no one else is out here. When the grass grows too long, a city crew comes out and mows each yard. A garbage truck comes out every Tuesday and stops at each house, even with my bin being the only one out. Hell, even during winter after it snows a city truck comes and plows every driveway. Even though I never see any other cars.

It’s not like I’m complaining about the service, honestly. My lawn looks better than it ever did when I lived in the city, and I haven't had to touch a snow shovel in years. Working from home means I spend a lot of time staring out my office window, and for a while, I actually found the routine kind of soothing. It’s a very 'Aesthetic' lifestyle, you know? Crisp edges on the grass, no litter, no noisy kids screaming in the street while I’m on a conference call. I’ve even started naming the guys on the mowing crew in my head—I call the tall one 'High-Vis' and the guy who does the weed-whacking 'Stickers' because of a decal on his helmet.

I know some of you are going to say I’m just being paranoid or that I should be grateful for the 'private' neighborhood feel. And for the first year or two, I was. I’d just sit on my porch with a beer and enjoy the peace. But the novelty is wearing off. It’s the small things that get to you after a while. Like how there’s never any mail in the neighbors' boxes, but the mail carrier still stops at every single house to open and close the lids. It just feels like I’m living inside a clock that’s ticking for no one.

I actually walked out to talk to Stickers last week. I asked if people were finally moving in, or if this was just a service the city offers. He didn't even look up. He just said, ‘Just doing my job man,' and kept going.

I actually went on Zillow and some of those other listing sites a few months back just to see what the houses around me were going for. It’s the weirdest thing—the houses are all there on the map, but the listings haven't been updated since 2018. They all show as 'Off Market' or 'Status: Finalizing,' but the photos are what really gave me a chill. Every single interior shot, regardless of the address, is just a picture of the exact same rooms, living room, kitchen, bedrooms, right down to the layout of the outlets. It’s probably just a lazy developer using a template for the whole street, but staring at forty identical versions of the same house felt… off.

Is this just some weird tax loophole? Does the town maintain neighborhoods like this to keep property values up? I asked the lady at the diner about my street the other day, and she just kind of stared at me and asked if I wanted a refill on my coffee. She almost acted like she didn't even know where **▓▒▓▒▓▒** Drive was. Maybe I offended her or something.

If anyone else lives near **█░█░█░█** and knows what the deal is with this development, let me know. 

Anyway, I’m going to get back to work. I'll check back in the morning to see if anyone has a logical explanation. I'm just a little distracted because I was scrolling through my doorbell camera footage from this morning's trash run.

Usually, the truck just stops, tips the bin, and leaves. But today, after the arm set my bin down, the truck stayed idle for like an extra thirty seconds or so. No one got out, but just sat there for a bit right on the edge of my driveway, which is odd because of the consistency of the city. Almost felt as if the driver was waiting on something. Then the truck just moved on to the next empty house.

Well, if anyone knows anything or has any theories. Send them my way.

Once I got through the initial learning curve it pulled great tasting shots. But over the course of the last year or so the shots have progressively gotten worse in taste.

I’ve spent countless hours researching and adjusting (grind size, bean type, distilled water, shot pull time etc) in hopes of figuring it out and nothing seems to take away the bitterness and/or sourness.

I am by no means an espresso or coffee connoisseur. My wife and I enjoy lattes, this was our first espresso machine as we wanted to get away from going to Starbucks daily.

With that being said, I’m over this machine. I haven’t enjoyed a latte in months. I would like something that can create as consistent of a shot as possible. I understand I will need to dial it in initially but I would like for the machine to be as self sufficient as possible. What would be my options to look into?",2,1768329656.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I'm currently undertaking some mild renovations. I'm simply painting and redoing the flooring. With this little facelift I decided to rearrange my living room. The the couch, loveseat, rug, coffee table, and entertainment stand have all been relocated to spots that I find are condusive to conversation, gaming, and general relaxation. I like the setup. 

However, we get to the crux of the situation. With moving the couch, it creates a 4ftx9ft space between the back of the couch and the bannister above the stairs. I would like to turn this area into a reading nook complete with a bookshelf, side table and lamp, and a comfy reading/reclining chair. The problem is, I don't know how to best set it up. I was wondering if y'all could assist me with some ideas?

The space is 4ft from couch to bannister. 9ft from wall to end of bannister. The nearby window is massive and south facing (lots of sun during the day). On the wall near the window there is a heat register that is about 3ft from the bannister.

In regards to the pictures, the desk and the dresser in front of the bannister are only there while I'm redoing the flooring in my daughter's room. They are not permanent.

Am I out to lunch in thinking I can make a reading nook work? I don't like how far back the couch is if I have it against the bannister so I'm not going to move the furniture around.",2,1768329604.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False

When we made plans to live together we were both single. At move in we were both in now long distance relationships. The first couple of months living together her partner would stay for periods as long as a week quite often while mine would come only for weekends 2-3 times a month. This was never an issue we all would hang out and have a good time. I would say during the summer we both had people over a lot more than we do now. Since then I started a full time job and my partners work schedule changed. Since about October he has only been coming 1 or 2 times a month only on much shorter weekends as I work on his days off/vice versa. In November my roommate broke up with her partner and since then it seems to be an issue whenever my bf comes. Now when he is here she will not talk to us, will not come out of her room, when she does and we are in a shared space she won’t even make eye contact, and does not want to hang out or do anything. She broke up with her partner because she wasn’t very into him and still had feelings for her ex. Her and her ex have been communicating and planning times to get together. We usually plan for my partner to come over on weekends my roommate is not there so that it is better for everyone but at times when she is there I have been dealing with weird distance when I tell her my partner will be coming over/when he is there. I don’t know what to do because I pay half of everything I believe I should be allowed to have my long distance bf over. I also believe him coming 1 or 2 weekends a month is not excessive to the point that she should have an issue with it. Also my partner has always contributed to shared items when he comes over by buying toilet paper, paper towels, coffee pods, and is very clean, etc. When he started doing this, my roommate would want me to ask him to buy her other stuff or if we asked if she wanted to join us she would ask if my partner was going to pay for her, which I find extremely rude. I’m not sure what else I can do without the living situation being unfair to me as my partner and I both are trying to be respectful as possible throughout this. Not only that but he is facing the negatives of this situation feeling like he is doing something wrong when he has tried to be nothing but kind and respectful.

From my understanding, there should be enough coffee to sit right underneath the bottom edge, with the tool trimming off any excess. Right? If that’s the case, I need to grind more like 21g. Am I missing something? Is it bad to use that much coffee for any reason? Are these stupid questions??

An investigation is ongoing, but so far, no one has managed to find a logical, consistent explanation as to why my oxygen drops when I’m upright.
Anyway, I got a wheelchair, and it felt like a wonderful gift—to be able to get out again and have some freedom. But in the snow, it doesn’t feel like freedom. It’s simply not doable for me to get up the small slope to the parking lot in my residential area; it hasn't been cleared of snow at all, it’s just packed down and so bumpy that the chair gets stuck. Sure, I could gamble with my oxygen levels and try to push the chair up myself, but the risk then is that I’ll end up even more helpless if I run out of energy and faint in a snowdrift.

I'm not the best at making macarons, they can be a nuisance but this attempt was successful.


Macaron base Recipe:


A: Batter 
150 almond powder
150 icing
55 egg white



B: Meringue
55 egg white
15 caster

C: Sugar Syrup

150 sugar
50 water 


1. Preheat the oven to 140 degrees

2. Mix the almond powder, icing sugar and egg whites in a bowl until smooth and incorporated together. Set aside. 

2. In another bowl, add your egg whites and begin to whip them until frothy, at the same time, start the sugar syrup in your pan (C) and cook until the sugar dissolves. 

3. Once the meringue looks frothy, add the sugar in order to stabilise it. 

4. Heat your sugar syrup to 110 degrees Celsius and remove from the stove. It should be bubbling.

5. Lower the speed of the meringue slightly and stream in the sugar syrup whilst your meringue continues to whip up. Make sure to stream it in from the side rather than the whisk or it will fling everywhere. Also do it slowly and gently. 

6. Whip to stiff peaks (bowl should be lukewarm/mild)

7. You want to fold in thirds. The first 1/3 of the meringue, add to the batter and fold through until incorporated. The 2nd third fold gently again and finally fold the final third in. 

You should have a lava flowing mix, you can try the ""8"" method in order to check for consistency and to see whether the macaronage stage is good. 

Once done you can put the mixture in a piping bag and begin. For the Italian method, resting isn't necessary but can be done if you want larger feet on the shells. 

They're one of the most difficult things to consistently make imo and even I get them wrong at times.

 Consistency is key however so you'll get there eventually. ",7,1768328808.0,muslimcooking,0,1.0,False

Mom is 73, and a lifelong walking basket case.  Addicted to all sorts of things for as far back as I can remember, and—if anecdotes from estranged relatives are any indication—probably well before I was born, as well.  Currently lives with my mostly house-bound 92-year-old stepfather.  Her second husband, his…third or fourth wife?  Back when I was a Freshman in high school they were angry alcoholics together, so that was fun.

So now they’re estranged from everyone, have no friends or family that still talk to them.  They live semi-independently (we moved them into a nearby mobile home park after my Mom bankrupted them with her Vicoprofen habit.)  That was seven or eight years ago.

As soon as they moved out here, my Mom started shopping for new doctors.  I would “back door” each of the doctors after her first visit, explain that she was an addict, and that she was invariably going to ask them for opiates.  Surprise surprise, she couldn’t find a doctor she liked.  Had a laundry list of complaints about each one, after a visit or two, and would go hunting for another one.  Eventually she grudgingly settled on one she liked, and things were peaceful for a while.

I don’t know when she switched to this new doctor, without my knowledge, but it’s been 2-3 years, probably.  This one is prescribing butalbital, lorazepam and temazepam like candy.  I reached out to the doctor TWICE, both times after my Mom was hospitalized for fucking herself up with pills in some way, to be like, “Hey, just a reminder, SHE’S A FUCKING ADDICT.  COULD YOU MAYBE NOT?""

So I’ve told her doctor. I’ve told the hospital staff EACH AND EVERY TIME.  They make a casual note of it, and yet nothing ever changes.

""Advised the patient to consider outpatient counseling.""  Ahaha. Because that will happen.

So now we’re in a repeating cycle:  
  
She gets her prescription filled, and within a day or two she’s completely fucked up.  She likes to combine them with Benedryl and melatonin, for extra fun.  She also has chronic kidney disease, an eating disorder, hates drinking water, and only weighs about 90 lbs.  
  
Then she texts me gibberish, or calls me to complain that her TV remote / phone “is all fucked up.” (spoiler alert: it’s neither the remote nor the phone that’s fucked up.)  Then she ends up with diarrhea because of all the drugs, starts wearing a sanitary napkin because of the runs, gets a UTI, or her potassium gets fucked up, and she ends up in the ER.  She never goes QUIETLY, of course.  She goes kicking and screaming.  She was a mean drunk and she's a mean addict.  
  
So yesterday she calls me and I can HEAR how fucked up she is, complaining that her TV isn’t working.  I tell her that she sounds like she needs to go to the ER again, hoping to get ahead of the usual debacle before it unfolds. She angrily tells me she doesn’t, she’s fine, she just needs her TV fixed.  I tell her we’ll come over at lunch to look at it.

An hour later she sends me a text of gibberish.  Some of the gibberish looks like “help me,” so I try to call her, multiple times, to no avail.  I pack up and head over.

She’s up and puttering around, when I get there, but she’s angry and slurring her words.  There’s a broken tray table that she says she tripped over and fell, and there’s half a bag of crushed pretzels all over the carpet (she has no teeth, so I’m assuming this is why they’re crushed up…)

I vacuum up the pretzels and again tell her that I think she needs to go to the ER.  She again gets agitated and starts screaming that she won’t go.  Cool. I ask her if she’s fine dropping over dead on the floor with no one to help her. She says yes.  I leave.

The day otherwise passes uneventfully.  Husband and I have dinner, and as we’re on our way to an evening appointment, my stepfather calls us via his transcription phone and says that my Mom is on the floor and he can’t get her up.  So we detour there, and I call 911 as we’re on the way.

She’s still on the floor when we get there, but she’s alert…ish.  Ambulance arrives.  One of the guys knows her immediately, as he’s been here before.  My mother irately insists she’s fine, so they tell her to pick herself up from the floor and get into her chair.  In doing so she topples over and CLONKS her head on the carpet, so now the guy says it doesn’t matter what she wants, she’s going to the ER. (I almost... ALMOST... wonder if he let her do that, knowing what would happen.  Like I said, he's been here before. He remembers her.)

The other EMT starts grilling me about, “What is she doing here alone? Why is no one taking care of her?  Why was this allowed to happen?”  And then starts griping, “This is going to get reported to APS.”

Heroically I do not murder her in cold blood, and I’m like, “GOOD. THEN MAYBE SOMEONE CAN FUCKING DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.”  Because *I have* called protective services, and *I have* tried to get her help. She doesn't want it, from me or any-one else.  I offered to work here during the week to help her take care of my stepfather, and the house.  But she refuses all help, because she knows oversight = she can’t chow down on pills.

But sure, lady.  It’s so good that you’re here now, with a fucking answer to everything.

My stepfather’s response is, “Can I get some bacon and eggs?”  Yaaay.  To say that he is completely unhelpful in every single way would be an understatement.

I make him bacon and eggs, make sure he has coffee for the morning, sort their cat for the night, and we go to the ER.  They agree to admit her, because her bloodwork is all fucked up, and she has another UTI (SHOCK).  She starts screaming at them for something to eat.  When one of the PAs ask what she wants—they have pudding and applesauce, basically—she literally says chopped up steak.

IT IS TO LAUGH.

Now she’s still in the hospital.  This morning she was still slurring and fucked up, but when I went to bring her a charger for her phone (she lost mine since last night. Awesome), she seemed a little clearer, and they were serving her lunch.  I’m working from her house to take care of her husband and cat.

I took the opportunity to dig out her “hidden stash” and count all her pills.  She’s got crushed pieces of pretzel mixed in with her pills.  Needless to say, she’s been overtaking all of them, and undertaking the ones she actually needs.  But she’s never going to cop to it. She’ll say that they’re being prescribed, and all her doctors know what she’s taking, so therefore it’s OK.

I finally got her PCP to text me back, gave her the rundown on just how much she’s been taking, and stated—in no uncertain terms—she is an addict. She cannot be trusted with these pills. As long as she has access to them, she will abuse them. This will keep happening over and over and over again until she dies, unless she cannot get her hands on them.

“OK. I will delete them and tell the pharmacy.”

Great. My Mom is also going to LOSE HER FUCKING SHIT when she finds out I cut off her prescriptions.

I’m so tired.  I actually hate her.  There are so many more reasons than just this, she’s really be a terrible, awful mother my whole life, but I *actually do hate her*.  I don’t want bad things to happen to her, but there isn’t an ounce of sympathy left in me for her.  I think it’s just revulsion and resentment and—at best—ambivalence.  She’s been digging her own grave since before I was born, and every shovelful of dirt is being used to bury me too.",30,1768328806.0,Vent,29,0.95,False

[https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/december-cpi-breakdown-high-food-prices-especially-for-beef-continue-to-bite-181129892.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/banking/article/december-cpi-breakdown-high-food-prices-especially-for-beef-continue-to-bite-181129892.html)



# Cheaper beef? Don't count on it : OH NO !

**Overall, meat, poultry, and fish prices were up 6.9%** in December compared with a year earlier, driven by a 16.4% increase in beef and veal costs, which were also up 1% on a monthly basis. The average price for a pound of ground beef is now approaching $6.69 amid strong demand for protein and a shrinking cattle herd.

That meaty issue isn't the only price hike dogging grocery shoppers. [Coffee costs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coffee-prices-are-soaring-tariffs-could-drive-them-even-higher-190945442.html) were also up 19.8% in December from a year earlier, while candy and chewing gum prices notched a 10% annual increase. Banana prices also rose 5.9% on an annual basis in December, though they slid 1.6% from a month earlier.

Looking for something more affordable? Consider eggs, where prices have plummeted 20.9% from a year ago and 8.2% just between November and December.

# In the sky and on the road : OOPS !!

Americans looking to kick off the year with some far-flung travel have this to consider: **airfare prices were up 5.2%** in December from November's levels.

Still, the cost of flying is far below the ""revenge travel"" highs of 2022. Prices were 3.4% lower when compared to a year ago.

For those opting to hit the road, car and truck rental prices were similarly down by 4.1% in December on an annual basis, and motor fuel was 3.2% lower.

The picture was a tad less rosy for car shoppers, with new- and used-vehicle prices slightly higher in December than in 2024, though prices declined or held steady over the month.

**Hotel and motel prices, meanwhile, rose 3.5%** on a monthly basis heading into the holiday season, but were down 1.8% annually.

# Tariff price watch : WEIRD !!!

Are President Trump's sweeping tariffs hitting consumers' spending?

**Import-heavy categories like furniture and bedding, while up 3.6% on an annual basi**s, actually slid 0.4% between November and December. **Clothing prices, meanwhile, were up 2.1% from a year earlier and 0.7% on a monthly basis. And footwear prices jumped 1.1% between November and December.**

""Distortions caused by the government shutdown have made the inflation data harder to interpret, but the recent run of figures suggests inflation has peaked,"" Michael Pearce, chief US Economist at Oxford Economics, said in a note. ""We think tariff-driven price rises have mostly been passed through and anticipate further disinflation in services inflation in 2026 will drive inflation back closer to the 2% target by the end of the year.""

I’m trying to lose a bit of weight (10% of my current body weight). I gained those kilo’s because I ate very unhealthy and with a lot of fat and sugar (e.g.: pizza, cheese, soda, crisps). Since a week or 3 I started moving more and I’m now in a lifestyle that feels comfortable to maintain, in which i’d burn about 2400 calories a day (as told by My Fitbit)

I also started tracking my calorie intake since last sunday and I’m honestly baffled to find out how hard I find it to eat enough to keep a decent calorie deficit. By the logic of (my countries ?) health advices I’ve read, a good deficit would-be 500 calories a day, for me that’s an intake of 1900 calories. A bigger deficit would mean a crash diet? With breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner and an evening snack, I’d only reach 1400-1600 calories and I’m FULL and super bloated. This includes butter/oil during cooking, and I don’t drink calories anymore. Furthermore, I feel super bloated in the evening which isn’t motivating either.

I fully understand that eating healthier night mean your eating more, like 20000 cucumbers are an equivalent of 1 big mag menu. I just don’t get how I’m struggling like this? The tought of eating yet another snack is making me sick right now.

Is this a common feeling, am I just getting used to eating different or is there anything else I’m missing? I didn’t expect losing weight would make me feel like I’m overeating, but at least I’m happy I’m not going to bed hungry 😂. I want to lose weight in a healthy way, not a too fast way.

ETA, I Forgot to write down my final question

Is the calorie distribution over the day skewed? Is that a possible explenation?

An example of my intake yesterday /// today :

Breakfast: 231 // 231

Snack: 77 // 49

Lunch: 450 // 468

Snack: 49 // 190

Dinner: 753 // 664

Snack: 92 // (?? Don’t know yet)

Yesterday’s total - usage:

1652 - 2443 =-791

Today (moment of writing this post at 19.30 and I still have an 30 min. Aerobics class tonight so i’ll burn more calories)

I love the practice owner and the other therapists. I could move to solo private practice but I’m willing to pay the fee split for the social connections I have at the practice (as well as other business supports but I can do that on my own if I have to).

However, today the practice owner sent out an email to the team with a few “hospitality” requests and it’s not sitting well with me and I want to know other people’s thoughts.

She provides “fun beverages” for the team - mainly cans of sparkling water. She is telling us that we now need to pour out fun drinks into glasses or mugs before session. Her reasoning is that personally, if a client brings a drink in to session she gets distracted and as a therapist, us drinking out of a can or a coffee cup signifies that we are not ready for them or what they are going through. She says that we can make exceptions for a few clients if it would benefit them.

I have problems with this for a lot of reasons and I don’t know if I am just wrong and have a skewed idea of what is acceptable behaviour in therapy or if this is a weird controlling thing.

1) I am neurodivergent and have sensory stuff related to carbonation and pouring it into a glass is very distracting for me. But also the vast majority of my client base is also neurodivergent and also benefit from drinking a fun drink of their choosing during session and they have expressed that they enjoy the process of choosing what drink they want to bring to therapy each week. I don’t exclusively drink cans of sparkling water but I do always have a drink with me whether it’s tea or coffee. I have to because otherwise I will get a very dry mouth.

2) We often have moments of relational connection over what we’re drinking that day and also it becomes an opportunity to explore preferences when many of my clients have historically been in high control relationships and don’t know what they like anymore. It also is an easy and accessible way for my clients to practice mindfulness and begin to notice body sensations. 

3) I am very intentional about bringing my humanity into the therapy room. I feel like by her telling me I am not allowed to drink a bubly water or something…it is erasing part of me. If I’m doing deep trauma processing I’m not going to disrupt the process by drinking. I am mindful of my clients needs and if for some reason I think it would be clinically inappropriate to drink out of a can in a session I would not do it. 

I am having a big response to this request, and I want to know what other people think. Is it I inappropriate to drink out of a can or a commercial coffee cup in session? Is it controlling or acceptable for a practice owner tell you how you are allowed to drink fluids in session? ",21,1768328491.0,therapists,57,0.73,False

Today we are being called back to gratitude. Sometimes we get so consumed with what's not going our way, or the things that we don't like that we let that become a routine. We can get caught up in negative energy and not actually realize what we're doing, or how it's impacting our lives both inward and out.

And even though we may try and stay mindful of being kind and choosing positivity and love over stressing and judgment, every once in a while, we can find ourselves stuck in the middle of it and needing to get out. 

It may just even be something as simple as being a boring day, same routine, same responsibilities.

Maybe you're totally content with your life.

Whatever your situation may be, this card is asking us to take a moment of our time to really hold some space and loving energy for the gifts the universe has blessed us with today.

Maybe you went to work and didn't have car problems or traffic was kind so you weren't late again.

Or you woke up feeling tired and you found out your partner had coffee ready for you.

That dog yours that you love didn't terrorize your house during the night and left a mess for you to clean. 

Maybe it's as big as having a job interview or promotion you've been waiting for, but if not, what is something simple you can choose to find happiness in? 

Feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, really look at a beautiful sunrise or sunset. 

I know for myself personally, I sometimes find myself lost in sad thought about the condition of the earth and its people. I feel my heart start hurting and the impulse to get stuck in that lower vibration. So instead I will choose see the things that feed my spirit and lift me up, like a little flower growing through the cracks in the concrete. And then I will consciously choose my actions knowing how they affect that feeling. I feel like a parrot at work constantly reminding my coworkers to pick up their cigarette butts and garbage. It blesses and heals me to show the earth more respect 

Gratitude and seeing where your blessings are is a choice.
