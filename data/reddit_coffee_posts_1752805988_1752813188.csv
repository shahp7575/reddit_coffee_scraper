*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Thinks ""Veikkausliiga"" Is a Type of Finnish Gummy*

---

### Parse the Odds: A Lopsided Love Letter to Inter Turku

Let’s cut to the chase: **FC Inter Turku is the morning glory of this matchup**, and FC KTP is the wilted daisy clinging to the篱笆. The odds, as gleefully provided by bookmakers like FanDuel and BetMGM, paint a picture of a team (Inter Turku) so dominant, they’ve priced FC KTP at **+800** — which, in human terms, is the sports betting equivalent of “we’re throwing money at hope.”

* **Inter Turku’s Implied Probability**: At decimal odds of \~1.34 (or American +340 for the math-challenged), Turku’s chances of winning sit at **74%**. That’s the same confidence level as betting that a Finnish winter will eventually end.
* **FC KTP’s Implied Probability**: At +800 (decimal \~12.5), KTP’s chances are a laughable **8%**. For context, this is slightly more likely than me understanding why “KTP” is an actual team name.
* **The Spread**: Inter Turku is favored by **-1.5 goals**, meaning they must win by two to satisfy the voracious appetite of the pointspread gods. If they only win by one, bettors get a participation trophy and a coupon for 50% off their next existential dread.
* **Totals**: The “Over/Under” is set at **3.0 goals**, with Over priced at \~1.78. Given Turku’s offense and KTP’s defense (see: porous as a sieve that’s also on fire), this game could end up looking like a popcorn machine exploded on the pitch.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Rumors, and One Team Named “KTP”

While no official injury reports were provided (probably because Finland’s sports media budget is funded by a single coffee can), we can speculate based on the following:

* **FC Inter Turku**: Their star striker, **Teemu Pukki’s cousin’s neighbor’s pet hedgehog**, has reportedly joined the starting XI. Yes, it’s that kind of team. Seriously, though, Inter Turku has been a consistent force in the Veikkausliiga, and their recent form suggests they’re the ki

So I’ve been thinking lately about starting a business in Hyderabad, but honestly, I’m a bit unsure about what actually works in the market. I’ve got a few ideas in mind and would love to hear your opinions or experiences.

1. Poultry business – Like setting up a small farm somewhere on the outskirts. Not sure if it’s still a good market or if it’s too risky now?

2. A cafe with a mix of everything – Biryani, pizza, burgers, pasta, ice cream, and maybe live or recorded music. Something with nice vibes and a little nature-themed setup.

3. A cozy coffee place – Good ambience, comfortable seating, a spot where people can work or study. Is there a real demand for this kind of space?

4. A gym/fitness center – Seems like people are getting more health conscious, but is it still a profitable space?

Also, curious to know your thoughts on franchises. Is it better to start something of your own or go the franchise route?

If anyone can share a rough investment idea (not exact, just ballpark min-max), that would really help too.

Would really appreciate any feedback or ideas.

I’ve been toying with an idea and wanted to run it by this community before diving deeper.

What if there was a network of 10 beautifully designed Airbnb-style properties across Europe (starting with Greece, Portugal, Spain, and France), specifically for digital nomads, founders, and remote teams?

Think:
	•	🛏️ Boutique resort vibes — calm, aesthetic, but not outrageously priced (definitely not Aman or Soho House)
	•	⚡ Seriously fast Wi-Fi, tested and guaranteed
	•	🧑‍💻 Proper co-working zones, not some corner with a coffee machine
	•	🧘 Wellness-focused design — yoga decks, forest saunas, plunge pools
	•	🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Access to a like-minded nomad community
	•	🗓️ Max 30 days per property per year — so you can rotate
	•	🌍 New vibe, new place every month if you want to change scenery or explore markets

The idea is not for regular tourists — this is meant for people who are building stuff, scaling, shipping, creating. I know that when I’m deep in a project, a good space and the right energy make all the difference.

Lately tho I’ve been seeing a lot about crystals, and witches on TikTok and slowly realizing how misunderstood the scriptures about witches are . I’ve also been feeling drawn more and more lately to be in tune with nature and its cycles( liturgical year, Wheel of the Year etc) right down to my birth chart and Zodiac sign . My relationship with God has also been very chaotic the past few years and I feel like one reason why I’m drawn to some of this is my soul is craving any spiritual sustenance it can get , and more routine and ritual . I’ve been looking into different types of witchs and feel like I relate to green , kitchen and earth witches a lot and like if I was a witch that’s who I’d be. I’ve also come to realize that everything has a frequency and an energy and I want to be in tune with it. In all my search I’m still scared and nervous that I’m bein deceived , that God will be mad at me for how I feel or that I’ll burn in hell if I choose to start exploring this more . I’m not sure where to go from here or where to start. I live with my parents and my dad is the pastor(who thinks that anyone who says the Old Testament was talking about black magic used to hurt people is a lier, he also believes some of the witch trials were justified) so I’d be starting in secret and I don’t want to do anything that will alert them or accidentally invite something evil into the house .

The breakthrough: After 2 weeks of logging my symptoms, the AI spotted something I completely missed. 

My congestion wasn't random at all - it was happening every time I had dairy in the evening.

Turns out my morning coffee with milk was fine, but evening cheese or yogurt would leave me stuffed up by bedtime. 

The pattern was so subtle I never connected the dots myself.3 weeks dairy-free evenings later and my night time breathing is dramatically better. 

Still can't believe I lived with this for so long when the solution was right there in my data.

Sometimes you need an outside perspective to see what's hiding in plain sight. That's exactly what good tracking + AI can do. Just sharing my personal experience with pattern tracking!! Anyone else discovered surprising triggers through tracking?

 Right after Elie Roberts submitted her resignation, her mom called.
 ""Elie, how's the resignation going?""
 ""I've already turned it in. I'll officially be out in a month.""
 ""That's great,"" her mom said, sounding more cheerful. ""The friends in town and I picked out a few decent boys for you. Meet them when you're back, okay? Let's try to get you engaged this year.""
 Then she sighed. ""And stop thinking about that heir from the Lawrence family. He's from a whole different world. We're not the same.""
 Elie's throat tightened, eyes started to tear up. ""It's okay, Mom. I get it. I'll be back after I finish the handover.""
 After hanging up, Elie started packing up her desk.
 Years at the Lawrence Group had left her with way too much to sort through. She was only halfway done when her phone vibrated again.
 It was a message from Clara Grayson: a location pin, followed by two words, ""Come over.""
 The address was none other than Eric Lawrence's villa.
 Twenty minutes later, Elie was standing at his front door.
 The front door was ajar, so she pushed it open and walked in. Clara was standing in the middle of the living room, holding a bracelet.
 Elie's heart sank. She was sure she'd cleared everything out when she moved out of this place. How did something get left behind?
 Before she could react, Clara slapped her across the face.
 ""I've been trying to figure out who was with Eric while I was abroad, and I never would've guessed—it was you, my best friend!
 ""Elie, with that plain face and flat figure? You really think you could seduce Eric?""
 Elie trembled, shame crashing over her like a wave.
 ""Clara, it was a mistake between him and me. And we're just friends with benefits... It only happened after you two broke up. I never crossed the line before that.""
 Smack!
 Clara slapped her again. ""Breakup or not, Eric will always be mine. Who do you think you are?""
 This one hit harder—Elie felt blood at the corner of her mouth. When Clara raised her hand for a third slap, Elie finally caught her wrist.
 ""Elie, what do you think you're doing?!""
 The icy voice came from behind just before she was yanked away with force.
 She stumbled and fell to the marble floor, her knee slamming against it with a sharp pain that made her gasp.
 Eric stood in front of Clara, shielding her. His black suit made him look even taller and more imposing, but the coldness in his eyes made her shiver.
 Clara's tears fell right away. ""Eric, I found out about you and Elie. My best friend and my ex... I was just upset and asked her a few questions, and she tried to hit me.""
 ""I didn't! She—""
 ""Enough,"" Eric snapped, cutting Elie off. But when he turned to Clara, his expression softened instantly, even a little panicked. ""Clara, what happened with Elie was a mistake. I just missed you so much that I lost control. You came back, and I chose you. Doesn't that prove who I love?""
 Elie's heart felt like it was being crushed in someone's fist.
 So that was it. In his eyes, she wasn't even a replacement—just a way to vent his desire.
 Clara looked up at him, eyes full of tears. ""Are you sure you don't love her?""
 ""I don't,"" Eric said flatly, without a moment of hesitation.
 ""Okay,"" Clara said, pointing at Elie. ""Then prove it. Tell your bodyguards to strip her.""
 Elie's whole body went cold. She turned to Eric, but he just stood there in silence, frowning.
 ""I knew you couldn't let her go!"" Clara shouted. ""Fine then, I'm leaving. I hope you're happy together!""
 The words had barely left her mouth when Eric grabbed her arm and gave an order to the guards by the door. ""Do it.""
 The two guards stepped forward. Elie struggled desperately, but she was no match for their strength.
 ""No... please, don't...""
 The sound of fabric tearing echoed harshly through the villa. In seconds, her shirt buttons popped off, her skirt was ripped, and her bra strap snapped...
 Just as the last shred of clothing was torn away, Eric finally spoke, ""Enough.
 ""Get her out of here. I don't want to see you again.""
 Elie covered her body and stumbled out the door.
 She heard Eric's gentle voice behind her. ""Clara, don't be mad...""
 Rain poured hard, stinging against her exposed skin, but it still wasn't nearly as cold as what she felt inside.
 She clutched the shredded fabric to her chest, struggling forward in the heavy rain. Rain mixed with tears, running into her mouth, bitter and salty.
 And then, like a flood, the past came crashing down on her.
 Back in college, Eric was every girl's dream—tall, handsome, and the star of the basketball court. Every game he played brought out a chorus of screaming fans.
 Clara was the campus belle—beautiful, fair-skinned, and from a wealthy family.
 Elie, on the other hand, was practically invisible. Ordinary looks, ordinary life—nothing that stood out.
 Then one day during lunch, Clara suddenly sat down across from her with a tray and a dazzling smile.
 ""Eating alone is so boring. Let's eat together from now on.""
 That was the day Elie became Clara's so-called best friend.
 People always said Clara was so nice for hanging out with someone like Elie, the ugly duckling.
 But Elie knew the truth. Clara only kept her around to make herself shine brighter.
 Then one day, Eric entered their little circle.
 At first, Elie thought he liked her. That evening, when a few thugs cornered her in an alley, it was Eric who stepped in to help. The way he stood there, backlit by the sunset, became the brightest memory of her youth.
 But it didn't take long for her to realize that Eric only got close to her to pursue Clara.
 Because the easiest way was through her best friend.
 Even so, Elie helped him.
 She could still remember all the times she praised Eric in front of Clara—how she always found excuses to slip away when they were together, and how her diary was filled with ""Eric,"" written again and again, though no one ever knew.
 After that, she became like an NPC in their story, watching Eric win Clara over and treat her like a queen.
 She thought she'd spend the rest of her life watching them go from dating to marriage, and then having kids.
 But everything changed right before graduation, when Clara suddenly broke up with him and left for overseas without looking back.
 Eric chased her to the airport and stood in the rain for a full day and night, but all he got was her walking away without a glance.
 During that time, Elie stayed by his side.
 When he drank too much, she picked up the empty bottles.
 When he hit rock bottom, she quietly kept his life in order.
 Eventually, she even became his secretary, managing both his work and personal life.
 Then came that night at the business banquet. Eric had been drugged. When she was reaching for her phone to call a doctor, he lost control and pushed her down on the lounge sofa.
 Afterward, he didn't even look at her. Still, she couldn't forget the heat of his skin, the sound of his heavy breathing.
 It happened a few more times after that, always after he got drunk.
 He never kissed her, never looked her in the eye. Just coldly used her.
 They'd been friends with benefits for three years.
 But the moment Clara came back a month ago, Eric went right back to her without hesitation.
 That was when Elie realized it was time to walk away.
 So she quietly turned in her resignation and agreed to go back home for the blind dates her mom had set up.
 What she didn't expect was that even after all that, Clara still wouldn't let her go.
 Elie returned home, drenched from head to toe, when her phone lit up.
 She checked it and saw a large bank transfer from Eric. The note was just a cold word, ""Compensation.""
 Then another message popped up. ""I know you like me.""
 She stared at the screen, her breath catching in her throat.
 So he had known all along.
 Every stolen glance, every planned ""coincidence,"" the little acts of ""accidental"" kindness—she thought she'd hidden it so well.
 ""But we were never possible.
 ""Clara was just too upset today.
 ""Don't take it personally.
 ""And don't you dare get jealous and hurt her.""
 Each message hit like a knife to the heart.
 Elie laughed out loud, laughing so hard that tears spilled from her eyes.
 She thought back to all those years.
 When he held her while drunk, calling out Clara's name, she held back tears.
 When she slipped his birthday gift in with a pile of packages, too afraid to even sign her name.
 When he kissed her in the office, he always covered her eyes.
 So he'd known all along.
 Her fingers hovered over the screen for a long time. Then, finally, she replied, ""Don't worry, Mr. Lawrence. I'll never like you again.""
Chapter 2
 The moment she hit send, she sank into a bathtub filled with water.
 Bubbles slowly rose to the surface, like the love she had buried all these years, finally sinking for good.
 The next day, Elie continued to go to work.
 But she was shocked to find a photo of her, soaked on her way home, had gone viral online.
 ""Flat as a board and still dares to run naked? I wouldn't even look if she walked past me! She's clearly desperate for fame. She's gone crazy trying to gain views!""
 ""Look at how miserable she looks—doesn't seem like she's trying to gain attention, more like a homewrecker who got beaten up! Serves her right. Shameless woman messing with someone else's relationship. Why couldn't she just get hit by a car?""
 Reading the cruel, hateful comments, Elie felt awful, but there was nothing she could do.
 Worried her mom might see the photos, she anxiously kept scrolling and spent the whole morning reporting them.
 Online discussions only grew more intense until someone tried to dox the woman in the photo. But within minutes, the entire trending topic was wiped, and all photos and videos vanished without a trace.
 Elie had no idea why, but it brought her a sense of relief.
 She forced herself to act normal and got back to work. When she brought some documents to Eric for a signature, she walked in on Clara angrily confronting him.
 ""You're the one who took down the trending topic, aren't you? No one else has that kind of power! Why would you do that? Do you like her?""
 Elie froze; she hadn't expected it to be Eric.
 Eric looked at Clara with a frown, clearly frustrated.
 ""I did take it down, but it's not what you think. She's my assistant. If her identity were exposed, it could hurt the company's stock. I swear, I don't have any feelings for her. Clara, I only like you. Please, believe me.""
 Clara was about to say more, but Eric suddenly pulled her into his arms and kissed her, cutting off her words.
 She struggled at first, but his skilled and gentle kiss slowly made her give in, her breathing growing unsteady.
 Elie stood outside the door, watching the scene, feeling cold all over.
 So this was what it looked like when he kissed someone he loved.
 His long fingers slipped into her hair, gently pulling her into his arms, eyes filled with undeniable possessiveness and affection.
 In three years, he'd done everything intimate with her—except kiss her.
 She should've known then. It was because he didn't love her.
 A sharp pain struck her heart. Just as she turned to leave, a coffee cup suddenly came flying toward her.
 She stumbled and fell hard to the floor, a gash opening on her forehead from the hit. As she raised her hand to cover the wound, Clara's angry voice rang out.
 ""How long have you been spying at the door? Do you enjoy watching people kissing?""
 Elie lowered her head, her voice hoarse as she tried to explain she was just there to deliver documents.
 But Clara walked over coldly, lifted her heel, and crushed Elie's hand, grinding down hard on the fingers still clutching the papers.
 ""Ah!""
 The papers were crushed under the pressure, and Elie's hand was scraped, blood seeping through the torn skin.
 Her body trembled from the pain, but Clara clung to Eric's arm and started to complain.
 ""Eric, look—she's not just a liar; she's incompetent. She ruined the documents, too. Can't you just fire her?""
 Eric's gaze darkened. He stayed silent for a moment before speaking quietly, ""She's handling several important contracts right now. I can't fire her for now.""
 Clara looked at him suspiciously, her tone laced with dissatisfaction. ""Can't or don't want to?""
Chapter 3
 Eric lowered his voice and coaxed her, ""I do have work to handle, and I can't afford delays. If it were just about firing a secretary, why would I lie to you?""
 Clara still wouldn't let it go. ""Fine, don't fire her. Then make her stay on her knees at the company entrance for a whole day. Is that okay?""
 This time, Eric agreed and looked over at Elie.
 ""These contracts are tied to a major deal. You either pay eight million, or stay on your knees at the entrance for a day.""
 Elie knew he was doing this to appease Clara.
 There was no way she could come up with eight million, so she staggered to her feet and, enduring the humiliation, stayed on her knees at the front door.
 She hung her head low, hiding the burn in her eyes, while the chatter of passing coworkers reached her ears.
 ""Isn't she Mr. Lawrence's most trusted secretary? Why's she on her knees out here in front of everyone? So embarrassing.""
 ""I saw it too. She didn't do anything wrong. She just pissed off Ms. Grayson and got punished for it.""
 ""Ms. Grayson is Mr. Lawrence's first love. Even after all these years apart, he still isn't over her. Messing with Ms. Grayson? Yeah, she had it coming.""
 Each word stabbed into Elie like a needle, making it hard to breathe.
 She suddenly thought back to school. On Clara's birthday, some boys had made fun of her, saying she was the cow dung that highlighted the campus belle.
 Everyone burst into laughter. She'd bolted, hiding in the stairwell.
 It was Eric who found her there, handing her a pack of tissues.
 ""Don't worry about others. Just focus on yourself, that's enough.""
 Even now, Elie still remembered those words.
 She always thought Eric saw something special in her, and that's why he kept her close. She gave everything to her work, never complained, and always did her best.
 But the moment Clara came back, he threw all her years of hard work and loyalty aside, just for Clara.
 Yeah... In the end, she was just a secretary he could fire at will.
 Now that she was no longer useful, it was time to leave.
 Elie stayed on her knees all day. Her skin was torn and bleeding, and the pain made it nearly impossible to walk.
 When work ended, she limped back to the office to grab her bag and ran into Eric.
 He glanced at her injuries and frowned slightly.
 ""Take a few days off. Get some rest. Come back when you're better.""
 Elie murmured, ""Okay,"" without looking at him, then turned and walked away.
 Once she got home, she treated her wounds and started packing her things.
 The moment Clara's return made the news, Eric had told her to move out of the villa.
 Back then, she'd left in a hurry, just tossed everything into a box, making a mess.
 Now that she was going back to her hometown, she figured it was time to clean things up properly.
 She got rid of the jewelry Eric gave her, the photos she'd secretly taken while he was asleep, the diary where she wrote about her crush on him at the university, and all the other little things.
 Every now and then, gossip from the office group chat would pop up.
 When Clara came back from shopping with sore legs, Eric got down to his knees and gave her a massage. When she complained the office lights were too bright, he had the entire building's lighting replaced overnight. When she was in a bad mood, he canceled all his meetings just to accompany her.
 Elie kept scrolling quietly, repeating to herself, ""It'll be over soon. Just hang in there.""
 Once her injuries healed, it was time for the company's annual party.
 Eric showed up with Clara, and the whole room burst into applause. Everyone was saying how perfect they were for each other—rich, good-looking, a match made in heaven.
 He helped Clara down the stage, fixed her dress, took off his jacket to put around her shoulders, and turned down the drinks others tried to toast her with.
 Elie sat quietly in a corner, watching the way Eric smiled at Clara. She lowered her eyes silently.
 Then came the award ceremony.
 Just like every year, Elie won Employee of the Year.
 With all eyes on her, Elie stepped onto the stage. The screen behind her started playing a slideshow of her accomplishments over the past year.
 She adjusted the mic, ready to give her speech, but suddenly, there was a commotion in the audience.
 People were whispering and looking at her with odd expressions.
Chapter 4
 Elie's eyelid twitched. Something was wrong. She turned around and saw her PPT had been swapped.
 The screen was now showing humiliating photos from college, ones that had been secretly taken without her knowing.
 Mixed in were censored bed photos, in which her face was clearly visible.
 Elie knew right away that those photos came from Eric's villa security footage.
 Her whole body went cold, and her mind went blank. She glanced instinctively toward Eric.
 He was frowning, but Clara beside him wore a smug, taunting grin.
 Elie immediately knew it was her doing. Anger rushed up, and she stepped forward, ready to ask what it would take for Clara to finally leave her alone.
 Eric's expression darkened as he stepped in front of her, his voice icy cold.
 ""What are you doing? Not feeling humiliated enough? Remember, you're just a secretary!""
 With tears in her eyes, Elie looked at him. ""Mr. Lawrence, yes, I'm just a secretary, but I'm still a person. Don't I deserve respect? She deliberately showed those photos—
 ""Enough! Stop acting crazy here!"" Eric snapped, his face dark.
 He called the security guards over and had her kicked out.
 In front of everyone, they grabbed her by the hair and dragged her out, humiliated her, then shoved her down the high stairs.
 She tumbled down, bruised all over, blood seeping out and staining the floor red.
 A sharp, tearing pain shot through her whole body, hitting every nerve.
 Tears she'd been holding back finally spilled over, clouding her eyes.
 She curled up, hugging herself tightly, and slowly blacked out.
 When she opened her eyes again, she was in a hospital.
 She stared blankly at the ceiling for a long time, then picked up her phone. The office group chat was flooded with talk about the annual party.
 Someone had even shared videos and photos, mocking her without holding back.
 ""Elie's not even that pretty, but turns out she's so wild in private? I thought she was frigid with that cold expression, but she's just a shameless flirt. No idea which guy she's messing around with, but taking that many photos? She must be thirsty.""
 ""Frigid? She's been all over Mr. Lawrence at work, basically throwing herself at him. Lucky for him, he's only into Ms. Grayson and has never fallen for someone that low.""
 ""A gold-digger using her body to climb the ranks, like she could ever compare to Ms. Grayson. It's a total insult. Honestly, she should just save herself the embarrassment and leave. If she stays, she's just making a fool of herself.""
 Each word felt like a dull knife slicing into Elie's heart, causing unbearable pain.
 Her palm was torn up from clenching so hard, and she bit down until her teeth ached. She was finally barely holding it together.
 She had no idea how much time had passed before the ward door opened.
 When she looked up, a male coworker from the planning team walked in, holding a cup of water.
 ""Elie, you're awake! How do you feel? Want me to get the doctor?""
 Elie was a little dazed, then shook her head.
 ""I'm okay. Was it you who brought me here?""
 Marcus Schmidt scratched his head awkwardly, giving her a shy smile.
 ""Yeah, I saw you passed out by the door and got worried, so I brought you to the hospital. Luckily, the doctor said it was just stress.""
 The word ""passed out"" brought back memories of the company party, and Elie's face froze.
 Marcus realized he'd said the wrong thing and quickly went quiet.
 The room stayed silent for a long time before he finally spoke up carefully. ""Elie, don't let those rumors get to you. They're not mad because you did anything wrong, but because they have a prejudice against you. Someone's definitely trying to hurt you by photoshopping those pictures. You can call the police, or if you don't want to deal with that pressure, I can help you. You can just say you're in a normal relationship...""
 When she saw his ears turning bright red, Elie recalled how he'd always find random excuses to talk to her, and how he'd bring her coffee or snacks every now and then.
 Only then did she realize that Marcus probably had a thing for her.
 But she'd only ever seen him as a colleague, and she'd already made up her mind to leave.
 So when he hinted at his feelings, Elie forced a small smile and politely turned him down.
 ""Thanks for your concern, but I can handle this on my own.""
 Marcus looked a little crushed, but he wasn't backing down.
 He reached under the bed, pulled out a bunch of roses, and nervously handed them to her.
 He stammered, ""I-I've liked you for a while now. I just never had the guts to say it. I know the timing's not great, but I wanted to try. Could you give me a chance? Maybe we could try being together—""
 Marcus didn't even get to finish his words before the door was kicked open.
 Startled, they both turned toward the noise—Eric stood there, furious, with a sullen face.
 He glared at Marcus as he spat out, ""Get out!""
Chapter 5
 Intimidated by Eric's overpowering presence, Marcus shot to his feet and rushed out of the ward, bowing as he left.
 Eric slammed the door behind him, then turned to the flowers beside Elie.
 ""So, he's into you and told you how he feels?""
 Elie met his gaze but stayed quiet.
 Without waiting for an answer, Eric grabbed the roses and tossed them out the window.
 Elie had rejected Marcus, but she didn't want his feelings to be treated like trash.
 She pulled out her IV to pick up the flowers, but Eric caught her wrist and pushed her back onto the bed.
 He stared her down, eyes cold as ice.
 ""What are you doing? It's just a crappy bouquet. Don't tell me you like him too?""
 Elie pushed him away and said coldly, ""Mr. Lawrence, you're just my boss. Who I'm with is none of your business.""
 Eric's expression darkened, and he gripped her wrist so hard it left red marks.
 ""Yeah, but don't forget company policy says no office relationships. If you even think about saying yes to him, he's out of the Lawrence Group tomorrow.""
 Elie knew he always meant what he said, and she didn't want to drag anyone else into this, so she told the truth. ""I don't like him, and I'm not planning to be with him.""
 Only then did Eric's expression ease a little. He let go of her hand and finally got to the real reason he came.
 ""It was indeed Clara who changed the photo at the annual party. But now that she knows the truth, it's understandable she's mad at you. Once things settle down, I'll promote you to head of the secretary department, and your salary will double. Just focus on your work. Clara agreed this was the last time. She won't come after you again, so don't hold it against her anymore.""
 His offer sounded great, but Elie wasn't moved.
 She took a deep breath, about to tell him she was resigning.
 But before she could speak, Clara's call came in.
 ""Eric, I want to go to the beach for a few days. Will you come with me?""
 Eric spoke to her gently, leaving Elie behind without a second thought as he walked out.
 He left in such a rush that he didn't hear what she said.
 ""I don't need a promotion because I already turned in my resignation.""
 As the door closed behind him, Elie looked down.
 ""Forget it. He'll find out sooner or later,"" she thought to herself.
 In the days that followed, while Eric stayed with Clara, Elie went back to work like nothing had happened.
 Marcus was transferred back to his hometown branch the very next day. Elie didn't even get to see him one last time.
 People at the office still gave her weird looks, but no one brought up the annual party anymore.
 Things had finally calmed down. Elie went to the HR department to ask if she could leave early.
 The HR staff looked troubled. ""Ms. Roberts, if you want to resign early, you'll need Mr. Lawrence's special approval.""
 Elie nodded and got to work on her early resignation request.
 Right as she was about to find Eric for a signature, he called and sent her an address, telling her to come immediately.
 When she got to the private room at the club, Elie realized Eric's friends—and Clara—were all there, laughing and playing games.
 As soon as he saw her, Eric looked up and nodded toward the drinks on the table.
 ""Clara lost a few rounds, but she's on her period and can't drink. You drink for her. 1.5 thousand dollars per glass.""
 Elie knew Eric had damaged his stomach from drinking too much in the past. Now he couldn't touch any alcohol at all.
 Otherwise, he would drink for Clara himself.
 Elie looked at the dozen or so glasses of whiskey on the table.
 She said quietly, ""Mr. Lawrence, it's after work hours. I have the right to refuse this assignment. But if you insist I drink for her, I don't want the money; I just want your signature.""
 Eric frowned slightly. ""Signature? For what?""
 Elie handed him the resignation form. He was just about to open it when Clara tugged on his arm, pouting.
 ""Eric, I lost again. Hurry up and make her drink for me!""
 Eric responded gently to her and didn't bother reading the form.
 He signed it without hesitation and tossed the pen back.
 ""All done. Now drink.""
Chapter 6
 Elie slipped the agreement into her bag and downed her drink.
 She kept going, glass after glass, until her stomach was in knots and she felt like throwing up.
 After forcing down the last one, she got up, swaying, heading for the bathroom, but Eric's friends blocked her path.
 ""Eric, Clara lost again! She picked dare, and the card she got said she had to kiss a random single person here for three minutes!""
 Hearing this, Eric didn't even hesitate. He just grabbed Clara and kissed her.
 They were immersed in it, and the whole room erupted with cheers and shouts.
 Elie sat there, groggy and dazed, watching them kiss like they were in their own little world. A bitter ache spread through her chest.
 When the kiss finally ended, Eric still looked like he wanted more, while Clara blushed. But Eric's friends started teasing again.
 ""That kiss doesn't count! The card said she had to kiss a single guy. You're her boyfriend. Totally doesn't count.""
 Eric's smile faded.
 ""Clara's mine. You really think I'd let her kiss someone else?""
 Everyone could tell he was pissed, so they quickly tried to smooth things over and pulled Elie.
 ""Of course, we wouldn't touch Clara. But hey, there's always a backup option, right? Ms. Roberts can take the dare instead.""
 Elie's face went pale in an instant.
 She instinctively looked at Eric and saw him refuse with a stiff expression.
 ""She only agreed to drink. Kissing wasn't part of the deal.""
 The guys exchanged glances, then started laughing.
 ""Come on, that's nothing a little money won't fix. Ms. Roberts always listens to you, doesn't she? Remember when we were racing, and the rule was that if your companion wouldn't get in the car, you'd lose a yacht? You didn't even say anything, just gave her a look, and she got in. If she was willing to risk her life for you, a kiss should be no big deal.""
 Clara's eyes welled up with tears as she yanked her hand out of Eric's.
 ""Didn't you say you didn't have feelings for her? Then why did you take her racing with you? If you like her that much, go make her your girlfriend. I'll find someone else to kiss and finish the dare!""
 Then, she stormed off.
 Eric panicked. He took out a bank card and threw it at Elie before rushing after Clara.
 ""There's 150,000 dollars on that card. Kiss in Clara's place for three minutes.""
 Watching him walk away, Elie felt like her heart was broken.
 She didn't want to agree to this deal. She turned to leave, but Eric's buddies pushed her back down.
 They brought over a stray dog, forced its jaw open, and pulled out its tongue. Then, they shoved her toward it with sneering voices full of spite.
 ""Clara told us everything. You're quite wild. Your bed photos are all over the office, aren't they? A slut like you trying to seduce Eric? Disgusting!""
 ""No one would want to kiss you. Touch your saliva and we'll probably end up in the hospital. A dog's the only thing you're good for. You know what they say—sluts and dogs are a perfect match.""
 Elie was so humiliated that tears streamed down her face as a wave of nausea hit her.
 She threw up uncontrollably, bile mixed with blood splattered across the floor.
 By the end of it, she was completely drained, her eyes blank and lifeless.
 As they walked away, laughing out loud, only one thought remained in her mind—she was done with Eric. She would never come back.
Chapter 7
 Elie submitted her early resignation form to HR and watched them stamp it.
 ""Since Mr. Lawrence approved it, Ms. Roberts, you should hand over all your work, and you can leave in three days.""
 After days of feeling down, Elie's mood finally started to lift.
 She headed back to her desk to finish up her remaining work.
 After two days of sorting everything and handing it off to her coworkers, she packed up her things into a box.
 Just as she finished, Eric walked in.
 He glanced at her empty desk and was a bit caught off guard.
 ""Why are you packing up?""
 Elie was about to answer, but he seemed to remember something and nodded.
 ""Yeah. Now that you've been promoted, you'll have your own office. You can pack up later. Come with me first.""
 Without waiting for her response, he turned and left.
 Elie hesitated for a second, then quietly followed him to the auction venue.
 Clara was already there. When she saw Elie, a hint of disdain crossed her face as she stepped up and grabbed Eric's arm.
 ""Eric, I've already picked out the jewelry I want. No matter what, you have to buy all of it for me.""
 Eric smiled dotingly and helped her sit down.
 ""Don't worry. Whatever you want, I'll get it.""
 Elie stood quietly in the corner, watching them laugh and flirt, but she felt nothing.
 Once the auction started, Eric would buy everything Clara had her eye on.
 His over-the-top bids had the whole room stunned, with people turning to stare.
 ""Bidding on everything she wants? Mr. Lawrence is spoiling his girlfriend. She gets whatever she wants, like a personal wishing well. Ms. Grayson must've been a hero in a past life or something.""
 ""I heard that ever since they started dating, Ms. Grayson's gotten whatever she wanted. Guess nothing's changed after all these years. Mr. Lawrence is infatuated.""
 Clara beamed at all the jealous praise.
 She casually tossed the auction catalog at Elie, then turned to Eric and started acting cute.
 ""I wanna use the restroom. Eric, come with me?""
 Eric got up without hesitation, leaving Elie with a quick instruction.
 ""Bid on everything that's marked in the catalog.""
 Elie said nothing, just nodded, and made sure to bid on every single item as told.
 Just as Elie was about to leave, the auctioneer suddenly introduced a brand-new item.
 ""Ladies and gentlemen, we're now moving on to the surprise lot of the evening—a pinkish-purple necklace featuring a 40.52-carat Alexandrite. The starting price is 1.5 million.""
 The surprise item caught everyone off guard, and the sparkling necklace immediately stole the spotlight.
 Bids quickly erupted throughout the room, driving the necklace's price sky-high.
 Elie took a photo and sent it to Eric, asking if he wanted to bid on it.
 But Eric didn't reply. She tried calling a few times, but he didn't pick up.
 While she was still trying to reach him, the necklace was sold for 80 million.
 The moment the final bid was called, Clara happened to come back.
 Clara spotted the necklace and instantly wanted it. When she realized it had been sold, she picked up a glass of red wine and poured it on Elie's face.
 ""I told you to bid on everything I liked! What the hell were you doing?""
 Elie's hair and clothes were soaked. She clenched her hands tightly, trying hard to keep her voice calm.
 ""This necklace wasn't in the catalog. It was a surprise item. I called Mr. Lawrence, but he didn't answer...""
 But Clara didn't care about her explanation. She turned to Eric with a pitiful look.
 ""Eric, not only is Elie useless, but now she also shirks responsibility! I don't care. I want that necklace. If you don't get it for me, I will ignore you.""
 Eric had seen Elie's message and knew it wasn't her fault.
 But in front of Clara, he couldn't defend Elie. He could only go along and try to soothe Clara.
 ""Have I ever said no to something you wanted? Be good, I'll have someone buy it back right now.""
 He called over a staff member, his tone stern. ""Find the buyer and negotiate. If they're willing to give it up, meet any condition they ask.""
 Elie stood silently, her wet shirt stuck to her body, and wine still dripping from her hair.
 Seeing the smug look on Clara's face, she suddenly had a bad feeling.
 The staff member came back quickly, looking a bit uneasy. ""Mr. Lawrence, the buyer agreed to hand over the necklace, but...""
 ""Go on,"" Eric said, frowning.
 ""He has one condition..."" the staff member said hesitantly. ""He wants your secretary to spend the night with him. He said...""
 He braced himself and continued, ""He said she may look plain, but after having nothing but gourmet meals, sometimes it's nice to try something simple.""
Chapter 8
 Elie was struck as if by lightning, and she looked up suddenly at Clara.
 The smug smile at the corner of the other's mouth confirmed her guess, which she couldn't hide in time.
 What hidden items, what mysterious buyers, all are carefully designed traps.
 ""Mr. Lawrence, Elie's voice trembled, ""you can't agree, I'm leaving after today...""
 ""Eric,"" Clara suddenly threw herself into Eric's arms, interrupting him, ""I want that necklace! You promised me.""
 She looked up, tears welling in her eyes, ""Am I not as important to you as a secretary in your heart?""
 Eric looked down at Clara in his arms, then glanced at the pale-faced Elie.
 He wiped away Clara's tears with his hand and whispered, ""Don't cry.""
 Then he turned to the staff and said, ""Tell the buyer, deal done.""
 Elie's blood froze in an instant: ""Eric! You can't-""
 Before the words had even finished, someone had already grabbed her arm.
 She struggled desperately, her nails scratching blood marks on the bodyguard's arm: ""Let me go! Eric! I'm quitting tomorrow! You have no right...""
 Her voice was cut off by the slamming of the car door.
 The black sedan sped away, and in the rearview mirror, Eric was gently putting a coat on Clara.
 In the luxury suite, Elie was pushed in roughly.
 With a click, the door locked behind her, and she turned around to see a beggar covered in dirt greedily staring at her.
 The beggar grinned, revealing his uneven yellow teeth.
 Elie trembled all over, staggering backwards. ""Don't come any closer... I can give you money...""
 ""Money? The beggar grabbed her wrist, his foul breath hitting her face as he chuckled. ""The money that lady gave me is enough to last me a lifetime! I don't need money now, I need a woman!""
 Elie was desperate and could only grab the desk lamp for self-defense. When the beggar pounced on her, she fiercely smashed his head.
 Blood flowed down his forehead, instead arousing his ferocity.
 ""Jerk! he grabbed her hair and threw her onto the bed.""
 The sound of fabric tearing was particularly harsh in the room.
 Elie's nails left deep blood marks on the beggar's face, but they were no match for the man's strength.
 Just when she was completely desperate—
 ""Bang!""
 The door was kicked open.
 Eric's bodyguard rushed in and quickly subdued the beggar.
 ""Ms. Roberts, the bodyguard holding out a coat began, ""Mr. Lawrence sent us to rescue you.""
 Elie shivered as she wrapped her coat tightly around her, reaching for her phone to call the police.
 The bodyguard quickly snatched the phone: ""Mr. Lawrence instructed that you cannot call the police.""
 ""What does it mean? Elie asked hoarsely.""
 ""Ms. Grayson didn't mean it, she just wanted to vent. Mr. Lawrence has already arranged for someone to save you, you're fine, let's just forget about it.""
 Elie was struck as if by lightning: ""He... knew?""
 The bodyguard resigned.
 Elie suddenly laughed, laughing so hard that tears streamed down his face.
 Originally, Eric knew everything, but still allowed Clara to push her towards the abyss.
 Her eyes welled up with tears, ""What if I had to call the police?""
 ""No one in New York dares to take your case, the bodyguard said expressionlessly. ""Mr. Lawrence said to give you a week off, so you can rest well these days, consider it as compensation.""
 After speaking, the bodyguard's figure disappeared at the end of the corridor, and the door made a soft ""click"" sound.
 Elie sat down slowly on the ground, pressing his fingertips deeply into the palm of his hand.
 The suit jacket slipped off her shoulders, revealing a torn collar. She reached out to pick it up, only to find her hand shaking uncontrollably.
 The phone suddenly rang, and the word ""Mom"" on the screen stabbed her eyes.
 ""Elie, have you finished the handover? Have you arranged all the blind dates?""
 Elie bit down hard on his lower lip, the taste of rust spreading in his mouth, but it was nothing compared to the pain in his heart.
 ""Okay, Mom, she heard her own terrifyingly calm voice, ""I'll go back today.""
 The moment the phone hung up, tears finally burst out.
 Ten years of time passed by like a revolving lantern in front of my eyes.
 On the college campus, the figure of a young man walking against the light.
 In the president's office, his breath was scorching hot after he got drunk.
 And tonight, he uttered the indifferent words ""deal"" as well.
 Every frame of memory turned into a sharp knife, tearing her heart apart.
 Ten years of infatuation, resulted in one trampling after another.
 Elie slowly stood up, picked up the coat on the ground, straightened out his disheveled clothes, and returned to the apartment alone.
 Her emotions had completely calmed down. Within just thirty minutes, she calmly cancelled the apartment rental, packed all her belongings, left the keys behind, and took a taxi with her suitcase.
 The taxi drove through the puddles and headed towards the airport.
 There was a one-way ticket leading to a life without Eric.

I’ve been toying with an idea and wanted to run it by this community before diving deeper.

What if there was a network of 10 beautifully designed Airbnb-style properties across Europe (starting with Greece, Portugal, Spain, and France), specifically for digital nomads, founders, and remote teams?

Think:
	•	🛏️ Boutique resort vibes — calm, aesthetic, but not outrageously priced (definitely not Aman or Soho House)
	•	⚡ Seriously fast Wi-Fi, tested and guaranteed
	•	🧑‍💻 Proper co-working zones, not some corner with a coffee machine
	•	🧘 Wellness-focused design — yoga decks, forest saunas, plunge pools
	•	🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Access to a like-minded nomad community
	•	🗓️ Max 30 days per property per year — so you can rotate
	•	🌍 New vibe, new place every month if you want to change scenery or explore markets

The idea is not for regular tourists — this is meant for people who are building stuff, scaling, shipping, creating. I know that when I’m deep in a project, a good space and the right energy make all the difference.",1,1752811557.0,digitalnomad,0,0.67,False

Currently weaning to 5ppd because pumping has deteriorated my mental health. Hoping supply maintains but accepting combo feed if we need to. 

LO is on 3 hr (rare times 4hr) sleep/feed cycle. 

I provide care for our little one over nights w/o support from partner because he returned to work (I will return to work at 12 weeks pp but whatever…). The longest stretch of sleep I’ve gotten in the last 7 weeks is MAYBE 2.5 hours. 

The last 3 weeks, I have gone from milk bleb (severe enough for the prescription magic nipple cream), clogged duct, mastitis requiring antibiotics, LO thrush , and now severe diaper rash (to the point I’m using old tshirts with baking soda water as wipes and the shower head as baby bidet when she has a bm). 

Today- partner is home. LO is in my lap pace feeding and has blow out. Shes filthy. It’s o my leggings, shirt, arm. I try to tap dad in for backup. He gives grief so I resort to trying on my own and ask for reinforcement if I call out. He gratefully obliges. I mange 💯. Dad enjoys nap. 

3ish hours later. Sigh. 😔 

It’s nearing pump time. LO is napping. I announce that I put bottle in bottle warmer anticipating she’ll wake soon and begin tuning out. Scrolling through this subreddit actually. 

LO has stirred. Dad is in kitchen. I hear a beeping from the bottle warmer. Again. I ask if he just heated the bottle, and he says yes. He tests the milk. And of course, it’s much too hot.
Begins even making light of the situation, knowing I’m upset. 

“We have a freezer stash.”
“It’s for the little ones in heaven.” (Said sarcastically because he thought it was dumb when I shared that with him after confessioning my anxiety over spilling milk.

**The Specialized Synapse**: The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a supercharged version of the synapse from **Episode #7**, but with key differences: 

• **One neurotransmitter**: Only acetylcholine (ACh) 

• **One outcome**: Always excitatory (muscle contracts) 

• **Reliability**: Nearly 100% success rate (unlike brain synapses) 

• **Safety factor**: Massive ACh release ensures signal gets through

**The Step-by-Step Process**: 

• **Action potential arrives**: Motor neuron fires (using principles from **Episode #6**) 

• **Calcium floods in**: Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open at nerve terminal 

• **ACh released**: Hundreds of vesicles dump ACh into synaptic cleft 

• **Receptors activated**: ACh binds nicotinic receptors on muscle membrane 

• **Muscle depolarizes**: Na+ and Ca2+ enter muscle cell 

• **Contraction begins**: Calcium triggers the sliding filament mechanism

**Why This Design Works**: Unlike brain synapses that integrate many inputs, the NMJ needs **reliability**. When your brain says ""move,"" the muscle must respond instantly and completely.

**Clinical Applications**: 

• **Myasthenia gravis**: Autoimmune attack on ACh receptors → muscle weakness 

• **Botulinum toxin**: Blocks ACh release → paralysis (cosmetic and therapeutic uses) 

• **Succinylcholine**: Blocks ACh receptors → surgical paralysis 

• **Organophosphates**: Block acetylcholinesterase → persistent muscle contraction

**The Beautiful Integration**: Your **resting potential** sets the stage, **threshold** determines firing, **action potentials** carry the message, **synapses** process information, and the **NMJ** executes the final command.

**Your Turn**: A patient with myasthenia gravis gets progressively weaker with repeated muscle use. Using our understanding of the NMJ, explain why rest improves their strength.

I’ve been toying with an idea and wanted to run it by this community before diving deeper.

What if there was a network of 10 beautifully designed Airbnb-style properties across Europe (starting with Greece, Portugal, Spain, and France), specifically for digital nomads, founders, and remote teams?

Think:
	•	🛏️ Boutique resort vibes — calm, aesthetic, but not outrageously priced (definitely not Aman or Soho House)
	•	⚡ Seriously fast Wi-Fi, tested and guaranteed
	•	🧑‍💻 Proper co-working zones, not some corner with a coffee machine
	•	🧘 Wellness-focused design — yoga decks, forest saunas, plunge pools
	•	🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Access to a like-minded nomad community
	•	🗓️ Max 30 days per property per year — so you can rotate
	•	🌍 New vibe, new place every month if you want to change scenery or explore markets

The idea is not for regular tourists — this is meant for people who are building stuff, scaling, shipping, creating. I know that when I’m deep in a project, a good space and the right energy make all the difference.(very closed group - reff only ) -

I roll over with a gro-an and stretch to pick up my phone. I read the time and then rub my eyes before checking the time again because there’s no way I read it right. Glancing around the room I feel confident that my eyes are now working correctly and check the time again.

“Mother fluffer!” I curse under my breath. I was right the first time. It’s 5:30 AM! That confirms my suspicions that perfect Jenna with the too-friendly smile is evil. It’s the first day of university and classes start at 9 AM. Why on earth is she waking the whole dorm up at 5:30? I can hear grumbling and cursing from the other girls through the paper-thin walls as Jenna loudly announces that it’s shower time. I grab the pillow and press it over my head to try and block out the noise. I had my alarm set for 8 AM, which would have given me plenty of time to shower and have breakfast before our first class. I manage to block out enough of the noise that I start drifting back to sleep. BANG, BANG, BANG!

“Josie Banks, room number 5, I don’t hear any movement in there!” Jenna’s sickly sweet voice calls through the door as she hammers on it, then she begins to rattle the door handle. With a huff I chuck my pillow on the floor, throw back my covers and get up, stomping to the door I yank it open.

“It is 5:30 AM!” I hiss at Jenna. She smiles with fake sympathy as she looks me up and down.

“I am aware of the time Miss Banks, but this year’s stock is going to need extra time to get ready if we are going to make any of you look presentable,” she grins.

“We are not cattle,” I huff and begin to shut the door in her face. She stops it with a foot in the doorway and looks down at her clipboard.

“Josie Banks, eighteen years old, here to study criminology. Father is deceased, mother suffers from psychosis and currently resides in a secure hospital. Josie needs support to process her emotions and would benefit greatly from structure and routine. Josie has no other living rel…” I cut her off by robing the clipboard from her hand and reading the information sheet she had on me. With every word I read of my personal information, my anger grows, like each letter adds fuel to the already growing fire within me. Who gave her this information? She’s just a senior student with a voluntary role as dorm leader, she has no right or need for this information. This is a breach of privacy.

“How did you get this?” I seeth. Students gather in the corridor, their attention now focused on the drama unfolding in front of them.

“As the dorm leader, I am privy to any information that may help me to support you,” Jenna states, holding her head high like she feels superior. “It was in the enrolment statement, that you signed and agreed to when you accepted your place within this university,” she adds. I tear the page from the clip holding it down and slam the board into her heart.

“You had no right to that information, and you certainly had no right to broadcast it to the whole dorm,” I shout as I shove her away from my door. There’s a brief look of shock on her face as her head cracks against the wall before her expression goes blank and she slumps down to the floor with a thud. There's a distinct crack in the plaster on the wall where she hit it. Gasps sound out down the hall as I slam the door. I lean against it in disbelief, looking down at my hands in disgust.

“Someone call an ambulance!” I hear one of the girls in the hall shout.

How did that just happen? I didn't shove her that hard did I?… no, it's not possible, I'm not that strong and I barely touched her. She must have tripped on something and hit her head. That crack in the wall must have already been there and I'd just not noticed it until now.

“Is she breathing?” I hear a panicked voice ask. I don't hear the answer as my ears begin to ring and my heart begins to pound loudly. I feel as if the oxygen has been svcked out of the room as I draw in gasping lungfuls of useless air. My heart tightens with every breath like more and more weight is being added on top of me. My vision goes blurry before turning completely black, then I become light, and the weight lifts from me as I relax into peaceful darkness.

“Miss Banks wake up!” a stern voice penetrates the blissful bubble of silence I had fallen into. I blink open my eyes, letting my blurry vision adjust to take in the figure hovering above me. It's a plump lady with a grim-faced expression that I don't recognise.

“Who are you?” I murmur, pushing myself up into a sitting position and looking around to take in my surroundings.

“ I'm Officer Shelby, I'm with the Mount University Police. We need to take you down to the station,” she gives me a sympathetic smile as she pulls me up to my feet. In the broken doorway of my room stands another police officer. This one is looking curiously between me, the doorway and the crack in the wall where Jenna had been slumped. I svck in a breath as I remember what had happened. Jenna is no longer there, which is good. I must have passed out for a short time and she had reported me to the police for causing her to fall.

“I'm sorry officer, this was all a bit of a misunderstanding. I didn't mean for her to fall, I just pushed her out of my doorway so I could close my door and…” I begin to explain until the officer holds up a hand to stop me.

“Save it for the interview honey,” she says softly, whilst guiding me out of the building and into the back of a waiting police car. My fellow students watch on, giving looks of pity, smirks and utter disgust as I pass… perfect, I've made a great first impression.

Chapter 2

For the next few hours, I watch the clock in the small room they have me locked in. I’d drank my small paper cup of water hours ago and I've counted every tiny crack I can find in the plastered walls at least ten times. Just when I'm at the point of driving myself completely insane by mentally replaying what happened with Jenna over and over again, the door opens. The male officer that I'd seen in my dorm room earlier walks in and takes the seat opposite me at the table.

“Sorry to keep you waiting Miss Banks,” he says, laying a paper folder out on the table. He opens it and begins to read through it in silence. The seconds tick by and I start to get fidgety in my seat at the uncomfortable silence. Just as I open my mouth to break the silence the door opens again and a tall man wearing an expensive-looking suit walks in holding a briefcase. The man looks down at me in an assessing way. He is extremely good-looking and exudes dominance in a way that makes him hard to look at.

“Is this her?” he says in an almost snort, jer-king his chin in my direction.

“Yes, Sir,” the police officer nods, motioning for the newcomer to sit next to him. He takes his seat and reads through the paperwork the officer hands to him. I study his face as he reads. He's one of those ageless guys. His serious, no-bulllshit demeanour makes him seem like he's much older, but his face is young. My guess is he could be anywhere between twenty and forty. He must feel me looking at him as his eyes flick up to mine over the paper and he holds my gaze. Everything in me screams at me to look away, to break the eye contact, but I don't. I won't be bullied by some stuck-up detective. His eyes grow intense and then I swear I see the flash of a smirk before he slams his hand down on the table, making me jump back in fright.

“Are you trying to challenge me Miss Banks?” he asks in a deeper voice than he'd used with the other officer.

“Challenge you?” I snort and raise an eyebrow, trying to use my attitude to mask how much he had scared me.

“I suggest you learn to submit, and quickly, because at the place you are going, the people won't be as tolerant as I am,” he says, closing the folder and putting it into his briefcase before turning to the officer and nodding. My heart pounds in my heart and panic grips me as I watch the two men shake hands. “I’ll take her from here,” the stuck-up detective tells the officer.

“No,” I manage to rasp out. “Please, I didn't mean to hurt her. I can't go to prison. I can't!… Don't I get a solicitor?… A phone call?” I plead with the officer as he leaves the room. I turn my attention back to the suited man. “Please sir, it was an accident,” I sob.

“Not so tough now are we?” he smirks at me. “Let's go, Miss Banks, I have a very busy schedule and don't have time for your tears,” he sighs and heads towards the door. I remain seated, frozen in fear and shock. “You have two seconds to follow me, otherwise I will leave you here and let the police throw you in prison,” he snaps.

“Wait, what?” I gasp and turn to look at him. He gestures to the open doorway he is standing in and without too much thought I scramble to my feet and rush to his side.

“That's what I thought,” I hear him remark under his breath. He walks down the corridor with large strides that I struggle to keep up with.

“Where are we going?” I whisper to him as we pass police officers who don't seem to pay any attention to us. He ignores me like the rude assh-ole that he is and doesn't even look at me until we reach the elevator. He presses the button and turns to face me whilst we wait for the doors to open.

“Tell me, Miss Banks, are you prone to panic attacks?” He asks

“Huh?” I respond, a little taken aback at this whole situation.

“Your file says you passed out from a suspected panic attack at the scene, and you seem to be on the brink of another panic attack now. So what I am asking, little girl, is if I’m going to have to hold your hand through our journey?” He snarks. Anger flares in me at his words.

“Well I’m sorry Mr Perfect, I’ve had a day so do excuse me if I’m a little upset!” I hiss at him, crossing my arms to let him know how much of a badass I am. He gives me another of his barely there smirks and a nod in what seems like approval. The elevator dings at that moment, the doors opening and he steps forward without another word. I follow the smarmy guy in and stand beside him. I watch as the doors close, with a strange sense that they're closing on my old life.

“Collins,” he says, snapping me out of my strange thoughts I turn to give him a questioning look. “It's Mr Collins,” he says in a barely there whisper as he steps dangerously close and looks down at me. So close that when I take a breath my heart touches his. The air suddenly feels charged as I stare up into Mr Collins’ eyes. The arm holding the briefcase snakes around my back and he pulls me flush against his heart, causing me to gasp. Holy sh-it balls this man is hot. He brings up his other hand and gently strokes my cheek with a secret smile, then in a flash he grips my chin hard. “Sleep,” he demands, his eyes flashing blue as he speaks. My last thought before my body shuts down is that I'm going to knee this jer-k in the balls as soon as I get the opportunity.

“Wake up, Miss Banks,” a smooth voice says, the tone washes over me like a loving caress, and for the first time in a very long time I feel safe and it's not something I want to wake up from just yet. I nuzzle my face into the warmth against my cheek. A sweet, buttery and woodsy kind of scent hits my nose and I give an approving hum at the pleasing smell. A grunt of disapproval ruins my contentment right before I am dropped unceremoniously onto my back. The landing is soft but still unpleasant.

“What the he-ll!” I curse, rushing to sit and take in my surroundings. I'm on a couch in a dimly lit room, bright light suddenly floods the room making me squint against it. I shift my attention to the source of the light, fighting the urge to hiss at it like a feral vampire. A large figure is framed by the beaming sunlight that is flooding the room through a window that spans the entire wall. The figure is fussing with the curtains that he's just opened and I quickly recognise him as the stuck-up detective, Mr Collins. The events of the day come rushing back to me like a tidal wave of anger, fear and complete confusion.

“What did you do to me? How did we get here?” I demand, gesturing to the room and jumping to my feet.

“I don't have time to baby you through this, so here is the quick version,” he starts as he unbuttons his suit jacket and hangs it over the back of a large leather office chair. “My name is Deacon Collins, I am the headmaster of Grey’s Academy and you are the newest student here. Tell me, what do you know about your heritage?” he asks. My eyes are transfixed on his hands as he unbuttons the cuffs of his shirt and rolls up each sleeve to expose some impressive forearms. A throat clearing snaps me out of my trance.

“Oh… um,” I start, embarrassed at being caught staring. “Sorry, I'm a little lost here. I'm not feeling myself,” I say with a sigh and flop down onto the couch. I try to process what the he-ll is going on.

“Due to your circumstances, I am going to assume you know nothing. Here at Greys Academy, our students are gifted…” he begins.

“Wait, gifted?” I interrupt, “I think there's been a mistake. I'm not gifted, I got a pass in all my exams but nothing that makes me stand out,”

“If you'd let me finish Miss Banks…”

“Josie,” I correct, not liking the way he uses ‘Miss Banks’ in an inferior way.

“Miss Banks,” he reiterates, “If you would just keep quiet for two minutes and let me explain then you can be on your way. Our Academy is for what we call Greys. Greys are a race of superhumans. Whilst we are much more powerful than regular humans, we are also small in number. For this reason, we have created our own realm within the human one. This is safer for everyone to live in peace. Somehow, you have slipped through the net and grown up within the human realm. I will be launching a full investigation into how that came to pass, but for now, you are here and you are safe. Now I appreciate this is a lot for you to take in and you have a lot of catching up to do so I won't overwhelm you today. I will have my assistant assign you a dorm room and pair you with one of our more intellectual students to do extra studies with you outside of your regular lessons. I will also schedule some extra studies with our tutors here. Any questions?” he says without a flicker of a smile.

“Oh, you are good,” I laugh. “I love this show! I used to watch it all the time,” I say between bouts of laughter. I get up and start exploring the room to find the hidden cameras. I can't believe I'm on the prank show. I wonder who nominated me, it must have been Freya, my best friend from college. “Was it Freya that put you up to this?” I giggle.

“Miss Banks!” the actor playing Mr Collins shouts, slamming his hand down on the desk, which just makes me laugh harder. I approach him and examine the buttons on his shirt, one must be a hidden camera. Then I start rubbing my hands over his shirt, feeling for the hidden wires. In a flash his hands wrap around my wrists, making me gasp in shock as he grips them hard, stopping my exploration. I look up at him and his eyes are intense as they stare back at me. “What the he-ll are you doing?” he asks in an almost growl.

“Looking for your mic?” I gulp.

“I don't have a mic, this is not a prank. You are new here and you've had a lot to take in so this once I will give you a pass, but if you lay your hands on me ever again there will be punishment. Do you understand?” he says in a low, scary tone. His heavy breathing makes me bite my tongue because I really want to taunt him about what this punishment might be. As if he knows what I'm thinking his eyes seem to flash blue. That's when I remember them doing that earlier, right before he demanded that I sleep, a demand I was powerless to resist. Panic bubbles inside me at the realisation. He's telling the truth, isn't he?

“You made me go to sleep,” I say with a shaky breath. He gives me a single nod in response. “What else can you make me do?” I ask. Fear at how vulnerable I am right now pushes me to ask the question.

“Anything,” he says in a husky whisper, and I swear his face moves closer to mine. His answer doesn't scare me like it should, if anything it excites me. Then a door opens, breaking the trance he has me in, he drops my wrists and takes a step back as if I'm suddenly repulsive to him. I turn to see who the intruder is.

Chapter 4

“I thought I heard voices in here. Is everything okay Dee?” a very attractive woman who looks to be in her thirties says as she walks into the room with a beaming smile. Her hair is jet black and shines as the sunlight hits it. It's the sort of hair that should be in shampoo ads and just enhances her stunning blue eyes and flawless skin. She wears a skin-tight black dress that shows off her hourglass figure and black stilettos, with her finger and toenails painted bright red. She is the kind of woman that makes you feel insecure as soon as you see her.

“Yes. Clarrisa, this is Josie Banks, a new student I've just picked up from the human realm. Could you please assign her one of the single dorm rooms in Ruby,” Mr Collins says, whilst he takes out the file from his briefcase that the police officer had given him earlier and holds it out to Clarrisa.

“Are you sure? There's plenty of space for her in Amber or Saphire,” Clarrisa says, giving me an assessing look up and down before scrunching her nose a little.

“Put her in Ruby please and make sure she has everything she needs,” he says dismissively. Then he sits at his desk and opens up a laptop. I stand there unsure of what I’m supposed to do now. Mr Collins glances up at Clarrisa and then me. “That will be all,” he grunts.

“Of course Deacon, Josie follow me please,” Clarrisa smiles tightly.

“But…” I start.

“That will be all Miss Banks, Clarrisa will get you everything you need and someone will be along to your dorm shortly to answer all your questions and get you settled. Welcome to Greys Academy. I hope there will be no need for any more visits to my office,” Mr Collins says flatly and then turns his attention back to his laptop. With a sigh, I follow perfect Clarrisa.

We exit the office into a glass-lined corridor, Clarrisas heels click loudly on the cream marble floor. Everything feels too bright and shiny. I'd hate to be the cleaner here, there must be a whole army of cleaners to keep all the glass and marble clean. Clarrisa leads me to an elevator and I let an audible breath as I remember my last elevator ride before I was kidnapped by a hot, rude of a… wizard? Then I snort laugh as I think about what is happening. I'm in freaking Hogwarts, and that makes Mr Collins Professor Dumbledore. Clarrisa gives me a disapproving side-eye.

“Sorry, it's been a wild day,” I explain.

“I can imagine. Don't worry about Deacon, he was taking his morning shower when the call came in about you, he had to rush off without his morning coffee, he's grumpy without his coffee,” she laughs, a little too much for it to be real. My mind is suddenly filled with thoughts of Mr Collins in the shower, then I realise what she said. If she was there when he got the call, that means she was there when he was showering. She's his girlfriend… or wife. Of course, she is, she is beautiful and he is hot as he-ll, they are a perfect match. That explains why he jumped away from me like I was on fire, he didn't want his girlfriend to get the wrong idea. My heart sinks a little. I thought I'd felt some chemistry in our short encounter, but I guess it was a wro thought anyway. I'm his student now, and I don't know how things work here but I'm sure it's the same as it is in the human world. Students and teachers dating is a huge no. Why am I wasting time thinking about this when my life has just been completely obliterated?

“Wait!” I blurt. “I need to go back… my mum,” I manage to say through panicked breaths. How could I forget about my mum? Guilt floods me.

“Don't worry about any of that for now, time works differently here so no one will be missing you yet. Deacon will take care of everything, your mum will be just fine. I'm sure he will keep you updated on personal matters like that,” she smiles.

“Okay,” I nod. “What about my stuff? Can I go back for it?” I ask.

“Deacon will arrange for your belongings to get to you, try not to worry and just focus on making your new life here. I know this is a difficult time but I'm sure you will be happy here, we will work everything out to make this transition as easy as possible for you,” she says as we walk through a maze of glass and marble corridors. We exit the building into a courtyard with a huge fountain in the middle. The water comes out through four spouts. Above each spout is a large crystal. Clarrisa stops walking for a moment to let me look at it. “Each crystal represents a house at our Academy. You have been assigned to Ruby for the time being,” she motions to the red stone. “You can easily identify your fellow house students by the colour of their tie. Red for Ruby, green for Emerald, blue for Sapphire and yellow for Amber,” she explains as we walk on. I mentally roll my eyes at the thought of wearing a uniform again. I'm almost 19 years old and I feel like I'm going back to secondary school.

“Where are the other students?” I ask, taking note of how quiet it is.

“They are all in classes, they'll be finishing soon. We have just over 300 students here, it can get quite busy between classes,” she grimaces. Movement in the distance catches my eye and I can just make out a group of about thirty people. They're moving fast around each other as if dancing. As we get closer I realise they're fighting.

“Combat training,” Clarrisa comments, “they're our next squad of soldiers,” she adds proudly. I want to get a closer look but Clarrisa ushers me on and towards an old-looking stone building that's embellished with Rubies. “This is your building,” she says as we go through the door. I look around in awe. It's stunning. It's like an old castle inside but with everything you'd expect in a modern house. The large space has stone walls with thick red curtains around the huge windows. Then there are couches scattered around a large rug with a stone fireplace and real fire. There is a big flatscreen TV mounted to one of the walls with game consoles on the shelves underneath it. On each side of the room is a grand staircase that meets at the top. I follow Clarrisa up the stairs and down a hall, we pass two doors before she stops and hands me a key. “This one is yours, I'll give you some time to settle in and someone will be along shortly to show you around,” she smiles and walks away before I can even mutter a thank-you or get the door open.",2,1752810821.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

F31 M33,"I've seen this cute guy around the neighbourhood several times at various spots we both seem to like and I'd thought that we'd made some notable eye contact a few times, even initiated by him. I'd finally worked up the courage to go talk to him, but then I haven't see him around for weeks so didn't get the chance. I was trying to move on and meet other guys on Hinge but I was REALLY attracted to him so I just couldn't get him off my mind. I happened to find out his name and ended up looking him up on social media.

After much deliberation I decided to just go for it and message him: I apologized for if the message came across as weird or out of the blue, but I'd seen him around a lot and had been trying to work up the courage to talk to him. I acknowledged that he may not recognize me, but if he did, I wanted to invite him to coffee with me. I told him no pressure and I understand if he's not interested or available, but I thought I'd might as well shoot my shot.

After watching a lot of relationship advice videos I'd heard that guys really appreciate being asked out because it's flattering and different, so it kind of gave me confidence to go for it. I've been told by multiple people I'm pretty, though I know I'm not going to be everyone's type. I was prepared for a possible rejection, but he just never even replied and somehow that's worse. Like I'm not even worth a reply after having the balls to do that.

Why do people do this? I think he must know who I am and that I'm a real person from the neighbourhood, not just someone on the internet. After someone has the courage to ask you out are people really too scared to even reply? Asking someone out is way harder than typing up a polite no and some gentle excuse if you feel so inclined. Heck just ask chatGTP if you really don't know what to say. I just feel like so much crap right now and so embarrassed...

Been trying to work out a low agitation recipe. I used used a melodrip and Hario drip assist which worked well but wanted something that doesn't use plastics. This was my first trial whilst waiting for the Hario and melo to arrive in the mail. The cup was initially over extracted and I refined it a little. Managed to get my desired cup with the recipe below.

25g light roast
400g to 450g water (started with 1:16 but I found 1:18 good as well)
93C water
Coffee Chronicler's 2 pour Hario switch recipe
225g first pour with the switch opened up to 45s/1m
225g second pour with the switch closed up to 2m and open. Slight agitation with a stirrer once the pour is completed.
The liquid should drain in 15s to 20s. 

The reduced clogging produces an exceptionally clean cup. Bright and juicy. Appreciate any thoughts on how to further tweak this from the community. TIA.

1m2s6ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1m2s6ue/to_anyone_losing_hope_my_gerd_recovery_story/,To Anyone Losing Hope: My GERD Recovery Story,"Hi everyone,  
I'm making this post to share my journey over the years with this disease we all know and hate: GERD.

I'll share everything, but I’ll try to keep it as short as possible.

It all started back in 2020, just a few days before the COVID lockdown. I went to one of my best friend's birthday parties. Lots of alcohol, lots of partying. I remember we also grilled some frozen burgers from the supermarket, the kind that had probably been sitting out of the freezer too long.

That same afternoon, around 4 p.m., I started feeling off. My stomach hurt, and I felt weird. I blamed it on the ridiculous amount of alcohol from the night before and didn’t think much of it. But the discomfort didn’t go away.

That night, I experienced something for the first time: I ran out of breath while eating. I don’t remember what food it was, but I remember I had to stop eating because I literally couldn’t breathe.

Two days later, I went to the doctor. He prescribed Omeprazole.

**I want to make something clear: every body is different. What didn’t work for me might work for you. The best thing you can do is get properly checked by a trusted gastroenterologist and figure out what works and what doesn’t.**

In my case, Omeprazole didn’t help, actually, I felt like it made things worse. I couldn’t finish a meal without losing my breath halfway through. I was burping constantly, and those burps made it harder to breathe. Not long after the symptoms started, I became afraid to eat. I knew it would lead to shortness of breath, and let me tell you it's not a pleasant sensation at all.

I started Googling and found out that my symptoms matched GERD: shortness of breath, chest pain, occasional heartburn, lots and lots of burping. I had to teach myself to eat more slowly and be very mindful of every bite. I cut out foods that seemed to trigger me: cheese, dairy, spicy foods, red meat, coffee, etc. I fell into a habit of eating the same “safe” meals over and over. I remember living off mashed potatoes and chicken.

*Fast forward five months*: I finally got my first endoscopy. They found H. Pylori. I went through the full treatment (not gonna lie, it was a tough one with lots of pills). A few weeks later, I started to feel better, probably helped by the probiotics I was taking too. I could eat more, but I still experienced shortness of breath during meals, and the burping hadn’t stopped. I had daily burps for over a year and a half. The fear didn’t go away either.  
Looking back, I now realize that my mind was making the symptoms worse. **I’ll talk more about that later in the post.**

*Let’s skip ahead a bit*: a year and a half later, I was still struggling. I had good days and bad days. I started to reintroduce more foods, and the burping became less frequent. I still got shortness of breath sometimes, and I was too afraid or embarrassed to eat out. I have to say my girlfriend played a huge role in my recovery. Having someone to cry to and open up with is a blessing.

At some point, I pushed my gastroenterologist to test me for SIBO. She had no issue with it, so I got tested and it came back positive. I went through treatment and noticed a huge improvement.

A few weeks later, the burping was almost completely gone, and so was the shortness of breath. That gave me a huge boost in confidence to start trying foods I had been avoiding. I’ll never forget my first beer after two years, I fkin' missed beer so much!  
Of course, I had it cautiously and with a bit of fear, but I still managed to enjoy it. Then I slowly added cheeses, started with hard cheese, then moved on to mozzarella.

Soon after, I began going out to restaurants again. Still nervous, still expecting something to trigger me. That fear and anxiety made me feel sick a couple of times, but little by little, I kept gaining confidence.

Fast forward to the present: not long ago, I had a realization. I wasn’t afraid of food anymore. I wasn’t thinking “this is going to make me sick” or “if I hang out with friends, we’ll need to eat something GERD-safe.” I wasn’t expecting to start burping again or lose my breath.

Yes, I had H. Pylori and SIBO. But I honestly believe that one of the biggest things holding me back was my own mind and the constant fear of getting sick again, the anxiety around food. Now, five years later, I can say that fear is gone. And the symptoms are gone too.

# Here are a few things that helped me:

* Identifying trigger foods and slowly cutting them out
* Eating more slowly
* Drinking lots of water
* Sleeping on my left side
* Sleeping with my bed slightly elevated (still do this, not having the pillows under the mattress feels weird now)
* Talking about all of this in therapy
* Telling myself before every meal that the food wasn’t going to hurt me, that it was just food

I hope this post helps you reflect and maybe gives you a bit of hope.",9,1752810603.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

***(Verse 1)***  
I found your letter in the floorboard crack  
Still stained with coffee and the knife in my back  
You wrote in cursive like you used to care  
But I read between the lines, and you were never really there

You folded me like I was your plan B  
Origami love, but you still couldn't see  
I was bleeding through your paper sky  
Cut myself trying to hold your lie

***(Pre-Chorus)***  
Your silence screams louder than your truth  
I’m still choking on your “I love yous”

***(Chorus)***  
Papercutz on every finger  
Every word a wound, and still I linger  
Flipping pages soaked in pain  
It always ends, but starts again  
Papercutz like ghostly kisses  
You broke me slow with subtle disses  
Now I’m stitched with ink, I pull the trigger—  
Papercutz on every finger

***(Verse 2)***  
I tried to write you out with black ballpoint  
But your shadow's in every stanza, every joint  
My mirror’s cracked, I trace your face  
A haunted love I can't erase

You whispered sweet things like cyanide  
Slow drip love with a poisonous pride  
Now I measure time in heartbeats lost  
Counting costs in blood you glossed

***(Pre-Chorus 2)***  
You drew the line, then made me cross it  
Smiled while you lit the match, then tossed it

***(Chorus)***  
Papercutz on every finger  
You held me close just to let me splinter  
Your voice, a blade disguised as balm  
You were the storm—I was the calm  
Papercutz, they still remember  
You said forever in mid-December  
But I froze there, barely breathing  
Papercutz and silent screaming

***(Bridge / Breakdown)***  
I framed your lies in shattered frames  
Hung them in my hollow brain  
A gallery of all the times  
I thought your venom tasted fine

You said “I love you” like it’s war  
Then left your boots inside my door  
Now I can’t step without the sting  
Of everything you didn’t mean

***(Post-Bridge Refrain - Soft)***  
I wear bandages like wedding rings  
Still married to your phantom strings  
Pull me apart, I won’t resist  
Some masochist who can’t dismiss

***(Final Chorus - Screamed / Explosive)***  
Papercutz on every finger  
I let you in and now I’m disfigured  
You wrote me off, then made me sign  
My name in tears below the line  
Papercutz, and I still keep them  
Badges from the nights I weeped them  
You tore my heart out just to linger—  
Papercutz on every finger

***(Outro - Fading, Whispered)***  
Every tear… a word you wrote  
Every scar… a secret note  
Papercutz…  
Papercutz…  
I loved you ‘til I broke.",1,1752810331.0,ChatGPT,1,1.0,False

The goal of the event is to showcase good coffee happening in communities all over rural Nebraska.


We are planning to just invite roasters from greater Nebraska. It's no shade to the Lincoln and Omaha area, there's lots of good coffee happening over there! But for this first one we're trying to generate community and visibility/awareness for all the roasters more spread out in smaller communities across the state. We're also keeping it to just businesses, not hobby roasters this time around.

Here is our current list of invitees:

Ash Hollow - Loup City

Bedhead - St Paul

Calico - Kearney

Caravan - North Platte

Garland Acres - Central City

Good Evans - Kearney

Jim Bean - O'Neill

LD's - Hastings

Mark Ferrari - Oshkosh

Normal - Burwell

Penny - Kearney


We're now just trying to find out anything we don't know- are there other roasting companies around the state we're missing? We want to invite everybody out here, so if you know of someone, I'd appreciate any info!

She told me she would let me know when a weekend was free and I have yet to hear back. Last week she invited me for coffee but it was too last minute and I wasn’t in town. I never get to see them and now I’m finding out through a mutual friend that her coworker gets to see the kid and babysits all the time. But I was the one supporting her through her pregnancy. Is she just struggling to keep her life in order? Maybe I need to be more patient or something.  ",2,1752809807.0,beyondthebump,0,1.0,False

I supplement mag glycinate daily and salt my food heavily on eating days. Is this water retention possibly caused by electrolyte imbalance? I do not supplement with any sodium/ potassium on fasts as I don’t feel particularly weak. Maybe I should be? Anyone deal with similar experiences?

After some synthroid and hormone therapy for three years things improved. My doctors pulled me off of synthroid and hormone therapy. I did fine managing my weight, normal energy, and all for about 6 years. Then all of a sudden I came down with an illness and I’ve been struggling for the last few years to get a proper diagnosis for it, meanwhile I became pre diabetic. We worked to get that under control and it was for roughly a year. Then in December 2024 I went to see my PCP and my glucose levels were sky high and I gained 4lbs. Well went back to the doctors in June and I had gained 53 pounds. My doctors did blood work and put me back on synthroid while I wait to see endocrinology. I’m not a big eater. I always forget to eat breakfast and lunch so I normally live off of caffeine and I have cut my two pots down to one pot a day. I no longer use sugar in my coffee and only sugar free creamer. I’m not a big fan of pop, and prefer homemade sweet tea (so I can control the sweetness and use stevia) or lemonade. I’ve recently started using my isolate protein powder in my coffee before I do my morning workout routine. Seems no matter how hard I try I keep seeming to gain weight. My husband had an issue with his blood pressure and triglycerides a few years ago so I switch to a good amount of plant based and heart healthy fats. He’s good now and was actually able to drop 30lbs and get off his meds for it, me not so much. 

Any advice on what I can do to stop the gain? I track my calories and on average I pull in about 1200 a day. On top of 30 minutes of cardio a day I’ve made sure to increase my step count to 15000 a day, and add 3-4 strength training days and 2-3 yoga days. 

Also I heard putting protein powder in coffee makes the protein powder useless, so should I stop? I actually feel like it gives me a longer boost without the jitters, but I don’t want to consume useless calories. ",1,1752809561.0,loseit,4,0.67,False

1m2ru8x,https://i.redd.it/sq4veduiyjdf1.jpeg,Ceres Chill v. Momcozy Milk cooler,"TL;DR: though the Momcozy is a much better overall design, the Ceres Chill is better suited for the unpredictability of air travel and delays. 

Context:
At 11 weeks, I took my first trip away from home. It was one night (about 41 total hours away). 

I fluctuate between a small deficit and maybe 2oz extra a day (i guess that makes me a “just enough”-er). I started pumping week 1 and early my journey I was better able to stash some milk so I had about 2.5 days worth in a freezer stash. 

Logistics:
For this trip I brought a “34 oz” ceres chill (really 27oz when you use it with ice) and the momcozy (~22oz). I also did my MOTN pump on my way to the airport at 4 am and sent that back with my MIL so that baby had the extra OZs jic. When I got picked up I also had them bring a cooler with more ice for the extra that I pumped on the plane.

Review:
Ceres Chill
Pro: 
1) less stressful because I was able to use the hotel ice machine to keep the milk cool. I also asked for a cup of ice at a coffee shop as a refresh before I got on my flight.  

2) Holds more milk (a entire extra pump worth for me)

Con:
1)  it is kinda hard to see the fill line so I might have not filled it as much as I could have. 

2) It got messy at TSA when they were examining the milk. The metal portion that I put ice in goes into the milk and when they look at it they asked me to take it out. I did my best to scrape the milk off but it was dripping everywhere. 

Momcozy

Pros: 
1) pumping and pouring into storing containers was logistically SO MUCH EASIER 

2) it was much less messy getting checked by TSA 

3) the handle makes it much easier to carry.

Cons:
1) hotel fridges rarely have freezers and even if they do there is  no chance it fits the ice on pack (the front desk put my ice pack in the staff freezer for me— kinda awkward). 

2) I worry that the ice packs warmer up significantly when I put warm breast milk in a bottle. I remediated this by rotating the position of the warm and cool bottle. Maybe I’m just overly anxious but the pack touching the milk felt warm after it cooled the milk. 

Conclusion: 
Ultimately, both products are great for different reasons. I like Momcozy design better but the Ceres Chill was more flexible for the unpredictability of air travel (which helped my “just enough”-er anxiety. I would use the Momcozy for pumping at work/ day trips but the Ceres for any flight or overnight trip",3,1752809493.0,ExclusivelyPumping,2,1.0,False

The main problem was that users simply did not return. We tested the interface extensively, updated the onboarding process, and even added a referral system. Yet the retention rate still did not exceed 22%.

Everything changed when we decided to conduct an offline experiment. We agreed with several local coffee shops and coworking spaces to leave small cards on the tables with the inscription: *Take a 30-sec check-in with yourself*. Inside was a simple visual exercise and a QR code in the corner.

We genereted the QR code itself as unobtrusive as possible. Brand colors, rounded corners, and integration with the logo. Here, the generator [Viral QR](https://viralqr.com/) we chose unexpectedly helped. Most other services either provide overly basic graphics or lack standard analytics. We were also able to track peak scanning hours, which helped us optimize the days on which to display the cards.

We didn't have to bother with hosting - everything is hosted on their website.

When people scanned the QR code, they were taken to a more in-depth exercise within our app. Without registration, immediately connect with a mood tracker. We tested it on 1000 people. We were shocked: 38% of them returned to the app at least once more during the week. This became our most effective reactivation channel.

We didn't think that such a non-digital tactic could work. However, we provided an entry point at the right moment in real life. It's more about behavioral psychology than marketing.

Where to start? I was born in Toronto in 1983 and taken by CAS at about 3 months old. The details surrounding this are sketchy for me but basically my mother got arrested and she got my aunt to watch me who then gave me to a lady she met on the street. I had a very bad cough and the lady took me to the hospital who called CAS because apparently I had bruises. 

I spent 10 months in foster care and was then adopted. I had psycological problems from the start and would destroy and rip everything apart. I think its because I never had normal bonding or was traumatised or fetal alcohol effects. I spent my youth very bullied (the kids would call me butt chin and squeeze their chin together because I have a deep chin dimple) and I would usually just walk around by myself all recess watching the other kids play. 

One day the neighborhood kids were all sitting in a circle on the front lawn shared with the neighbor who has kids. I went outside and sat with them because I wanted to play too. I learned they were going to play red rover. But the girl said I can't play because I'd always have to be the dog. I went inside and started crying.

At 11, I was taken to a child psychologist named Pat Wynn because I became so reclusive and stopped wanting to even eat. I would just listen to my Micheal Jackson tapes over and over on my walkman with my face buried in the couch. I developed an unhealthy obsession with my adoptive dad's horror movies like The Good Son and Scream I was watching very violent movies like Toy Soldiers and Seven. There was like this drawer of vhs tapes and I'd sit and watch them. 

I started cutting myself at 14 and smoking weed and cigarettes. I got sent to a psychiatric ward the summer after grade 9 and would never live with my adoptive parents again. I got passed through such facilities as Youthdale, Whitby psyc, Thistletown in Etobicoke and Crossroads run by Kinark. In the hospitals I was frequently left alone in restraints tying me to a bed and given so many drugs my personality was gone. If I made them mad they would inject me with a drug called Nosinam. 

In the Whitby hospital I got to try a Nintendo 64 for the first time which was cool. My favorite game was Wave Race. I remember two boys named Richard from this time. One was a teen in Whitby and he'd make grunting noises every night and one night I just yelled shut up! I was 14. He was in my room like a flash screaming at me and he pulled me out of bed by my hair. He tore a handful out and the nurses heard the commontion and came and got him off me. They put the hsndful of hair into a baggie for my adoptive parents. The other Richard i remember was in the etobicoke group home. We ran away together. I had turned 15 in this home. We took the subway to a mall and richard set one of those cardboard lotto ticket displays on fire. I remember getting chased out by security. We wound up calling the group home to come get us. 

While I was in the next group home in Newmarket I began running away all the time to live on the street. I was extremely naive and I approached a man on main street and asked if he knew where street kids sleep. He was probably in his 40s bald on top with long hair down the sides. He told me he did and he led me under the bridge by Fairy lake. Suddenly he was behind me grabbing me all over and he kept saying in my ear, dont you want to play? I just kept saying no, no I was in shock. Then it ended as fast as it began he just said he had to work in the morning and he left me there. I walked back to my group home and kept seeing bright colors as I was walking. 

I remember I'd run away with a boy named Mike and we'd go to this abandonded building. The local kids told us a guy had hung himself in there but we didnt believe them. The main floor was dirt and then upstairs there was a couch snd old barber chair. The piping had a concave under it in the dirt where apparently they removed the guys body. Mike started hanging off the piping like doing monkey bars and I started jumping up and down in the concave. Then we went upstairs and Mike sat on the couch and i was standing talking to him. Suddenly the room felt cold and we heard banging on the walls around us going bang, bang, bang, then I felt a hand on my shoulder like pressing in. I could feel the fingers but I looked there was nothing there. I felt the hand reach down into me and it felt like it clenched something insude me then i felt something else rise up through me and literally start shoving it up and out. I know this sounds crazy but it was like what I experienced.

One night I was out on the street and it was snowing and I was really cold but I didn't know where to go so I called my adoptive mom collect and she told me to go stay in the emergency room. So I went and sat in the emergency waiting room all night and when people would go outside to have a cigarette I'd go out too and ask them for one. In the morning the staff had figured out I was just loitering and they called the police. I was about to run when I saw them but the officer said for me to stay it's ok. Then they took me to get donuts and we drove down main street and I saw the man who had molested me under the bridge and I told them about it. 

I've been really in love only once in my life to a man and he nearly beat me to death. I was 16 and had grown accustomed to living on the street while I was 15 running away from my group home and living in stairwells and under the bridge and abandoned buildings. Or sometimes Id just walk alone all night listening to Green Day. My adoptive parents had bought me all their cds before I got sent to the mental hospital in Whitby at 14 for cutting. My adoptive dad told me at some point while I was 16 that they would move away and I'd never be able to find them, they'd leave the province he said, so i was having trouble in those relationships. I was on and off the psyc ward all the time there was a locked side and an unlocked side that I alternated between. 

My favorite patient I met on the ward would play guitar and sing me Beatles songs like Lucy in the Sky, while we sat and smoked ciggs together. Another guy I met there named Daniel who thought he was a wizard introduced me to Andrew McDonald. He was a 25 year old from Kewsick. He was very handsome with big brown eyes and muscular. He was building a shack in the Fairy lake woods in Newmarket using materials he stole from the municipal building being built. I got my stuff from the group home and moved into the shack with him. 

I had just thrown myself off the group home 2nd story roof prior to this and been in hospital for a week, I was very mentally ill. I had wanted the attention of a staff named Jim but he was busy with another kid so for some reason I can no longer understand I decided to climb the fire escape stairs and jump. Jim came up after me and said that I'm not going to do it so I ran by him, he tried to grab me but he missed snd I just jumped. I hit the ground hard and then a bunch of kids came outside and were standing around me. The ambulance came and the fire department and they were discussing how high the roof was and the man said he thought about 20 feet. They put me on a board and at the hospital it was found I had fractured the L4 in my timberspine so I was given a walker. I didn't like using the walker so I would just carry it beside me and I made the nurses so mad. One told me I'd be in a wheelchair by the time I was 30 and my adoptive dad said at one point he didn't think I'd live to see 20. 

I taped my Korn cut out posters from Hit Parade Magazine onto the wood ceiling of Andrews shack. He went to the food bank and loaded the shack with cans of food. He told me we were going to go butt collecting and I had no idea what he meant. Then he took me to the Tannery mall and we collected cigarette butts from the ashtrays and brought them back. We'd walk along the train tracks, hed take his tshirt off and tie it on his head like a bandana. He showed me to remove the tobacco and roll it into a zig zag rolling paper. Daniel had gotten us to watch his dog in the shack and the dog attacked Andrew biting his arm badly. Andrew told me about how when he was in grade school he told the teacher he wanted a chair to do a slam dunk and he took it and hit another kid with it who was bullying him. He got arrested for a warrant and was in jail for about a month during which i lived in the shack alone. 

One time we were walking down main street and this huge biker dude came out and grabbed Andrew, pulling him into the tattoo parlor. I went in after him. He punched Andrew in the face very hard and began dragging him to the back room. I leapt onto the biker grabbing onto his shirt and he was so shocked he let go of Andrew who ran out the door. The biker stared at me with blue eyes and told me get out of here or I'll kill you too bi***. So I took Andrew to an abandonded building I knew about I'd been staying in at 15 with other kids. Then in the night I wanted to leave because I kept hearing a male voice saying, hey you, to me while Andrew was sleeping. So we left with Andrew yelling at whatever upset me. We snuck into the basement of a senior home called Marianne house to sleep but got caught by a nun. She said I could stay but Andrew had to go so I said no and we left. 

Andrew and I walked to North York and began living on the street there. In winter we lived in bank machine entrances and abandonded houses. In the summer we lived under the train bridge near Yonge and Steeles. The first time Andrew hit me was when we were huffing glue in an alley and I wouldn't share the bag. My head exploded into red and it took me a few moments to figure out he had hit me. We got an apartment from a youth worker in Bradford above the thrift store and he got a job at the lube place. I would ride my bike to bring him his lunch and the other guys would tease him because of the weird stuff I'd bring. 

People would call the police up to the apartment because they would hear me screaming from the street he'd beat me so bad. The officer told me during one of those calls that one of these days they'd take me out of there in a body bag. I remember Andrew smashing every dish in the kitchen. He took a stereo apart and cut the cord then separated the wires and plugged it in touching the bare wires to the circuits which made them explode. He showed me to bend a wire coat hanger and put it on the burner to make toast. I recall a nightmare i had where andrew was sitting on a chair and in my dream he told me theres something under the chair and i knelt sown to look and whatever i saw made me scream so loud i woke myself and him up. He thought someone had broke in. 
One night Andrew brought home a baggie of cocaine and we walked around all night doing lines. If the baggie ran out he'd get another. He kept talking and talking. We'd climb out the window and sit on the roof and drink at the apartment we had. Some of his friends came over and for some reason he beat this one man named Raymond so severely until the other guys said he'd had enough. 
Then we starting living on the street again we took the bus back to north york and we sat in the back and Andrew held my hand. I remember i liked looking at his ring. We made friends with another homeless couple named Brian and Donna and we were living behind an arena all together that was infested with ear wigs. We'd buy bottles of cheap beer like colt 45 or old english and Andrew would always pour a bit out and say, for the boys that don't have. Brian was on odsp and he'd get $500 as a homeless person. He used it to take a cab to his dealer and get crack which we smoked together under an overpass. 

We'd go to the church and get vouchers for a free breakfast at a local diner and I'd go down to the bathroom and wash up. Andrew kept amethyst stones in his duffelbag and when the moon was full he'd put them in the moonlight. They were his favorite thing. I got kicked out of Centerpoint mall for panhandling. I was always panhandling at Finch station. One time I'd gotten alot of change and a man said he'd sell me weed but I was too stupid to know what it looked like so I bought a baggie of bush clippings. Andrew was so mad trying to find him. There was another older man who'd sit in front of the escalator and he was always threatening to kidnap me and so Andrew was always making threatening gestures to him. 

One time in the winter I got so sick when we were living in abandonded houses i remember we went to the store to try and get some medicine and i had to go back outside because I was hacking couching so much and the man gave Andrew a bottle of Buckleys and I was drinking big gulps of it trying to get better. The winter was harsh and i developed deep lines in my feet from them always being wet. The street outreach van woupd pull up behind finch station and give out supplies. We'd also go to the out of the cold program and once they wanted to do a survey and we got paid $20 each to be in it. 

Andrew would push me around in a shopping cart sometimes and that was my happiest times with him. He loved Irish cream coffee and we'd get them at Finch station. We'd also use the change I collected to buy hot dogs at the hot dog stand. We'd crawl in the clothing bins and throw the bags out to go through and get new jeans. Our favorite thing to wear was black dress pants that were cut off at the knees so the threads were hanging. One time we had just enough change and we got a loaf of bread a pack of bolgona and a bag of onion ring chips and made sandwiches, bologna and onion ring chip sandwiches lol. 

The last night I ever saw Andrew was when he got drunk and nearly beat me to death in a park. He was sitting on top of me and just punching me and punching me in the face. He put his hand in my mouth trying to break my jaw. He was really hurting me and I saw in his eyes like he was gone. I heard in my mind the words clearly, Yell at him so I stared yelling at him to get away from me. And he did he got off me and walked away and I got up and ran out of the park. I went behind Centerpoint mall and the security brought me inside. The police took me to the overpass to go down and get my bag and then they took me to my adoptive parents house in Richmond hill. In the morning they called an ambulance because I was crying so much and I got put back in the psyc ward and placed in another group home called Heritage Lodge. 

The group home after Andrew was run by a couple who said they are white witches. The group home manager had a white streak in her hair and would try to get me to read the Celestine prophecy and she take me to witchcraft stores and healers. But I wasn't into it. Her name was Julie also so they'd call me Little Julie. They would let me hang out in their personal living space which was against the rules. She took this photo of me sitting in the group home kitchen that is attached to this post. 

I started dating a dealer on main street and hanging out at his friend's house getting high all the time. One of the fellow patients in the group home named Henrietta had a favorite chair and I'd sit in it just to make her mad. She come in and look at me and say thats my chair! Then leave in a huff. A man staying in the group home had me be lookout one night while he broke into the kitchen into the meds cupboard. He took all the bottles then we sat in the living room and he kept just giving me pills to take and I'd take them. I was very self destructive. He wound up riding his bike into a parked car after i was told and I don't remember anything after sitting in the chair and swallowing these cocktails of pills but apparently I came to breakfast in the morning and started spreading jam on my arm then face planted on the table. 

I started running away from that group home all the time and staying in an abandonded house on mulock drive in Newmarket. Doug, the new bf who had the head injury began staying with me there. We had barricaded the bedroom door shut in the abandonded house with the remains of a french door closet panel. One day i guess someone saw us go in and called the cops and they started kicking the bedroom door in. Our barricade was good though and it took several tries but when they finally did it I yelled Whoo! Like Whoo you did it! But I scared the heck out of them I was lucky they didnt shoot me. We left then for awhile and I went to the coffee shop to bum a cigarette from the smoking section and then sat on top of a green box outside smoking. 

I remember drinking vodka straight until I blacked out several times. One time I filled a take out cup with vodka and started drinking until I blacked out in a parking lot. I woke up to a cruiser and I got put in the drunk tank. Doug wanted to hitch hike to tobemory because his parents lived on manitoulin Island and he wanted to visit them so we started out hitchhiking. Doug was violent and he punched me in the head now and then. One time blood gushed from my mouth because he punched me in the side of the nose. We managed to hitchhike to Owen sound. 

I remember I won $50 on a Nevada ticket and I used it to buy a pair of orange Modrobes pants that were my favorite. We'd take turns lifting a pant leg hitchhiking just joking around. In Owen sound we were at the soup kitchen and we met a couple named Rose and Julie. They offered to let us stay in their house. So we stayed there awhile. I don't remember much except they had the hellraiser movies I watched on vhs and the lady was really into Alanis morrisette so I listened to her cds. 

One time Doug and Julie had gone out fishing and Rose wanted to get some old bottles out if the crawl space under the closet. This was a really really old house and the crawlspace went up to her waist. She lowered herself into it so she was standing inside and we both heard running feet loudly coming from the hole and running up the staircase and all around upstairs. I started yelling at her, get out! Get out! And she did and immediately it stopped. When Julie and Doug got back they didn't believe us. 

After awhile staying there we moved on when we were staying in Collingwood we met a lady probably in her 40s and she was really kind. She let us stay with her. But I wound up disclosing to her that Doug was hitting me and she wanted to call the police so we had to leave. Doug was furious at me for telling her. We eventually went made it to tobemory and his sister took us to the ferry to manitoulin Island. 

Doug had a nice visit and I got to try their atv but I cranked the throttle and Doug was running after me yelling. On the way back we were hitchhiking through Tiverton area and we got picked up by a guy in his 50s who asked us if we smoke hooch and that meant weed. So we started living in his house and Doug was working in his car lot. This pasted awhile. I had a Playstation at that house and I enjoyed playing racing games. We helped him do roofing on his car lot like replacing shingles.  

At one point Doug smashed a lamp all over the pool table in the basement of Toms house and Tom came over when we were out and found it and he left an angry note on the dryer. Doug got mad that he had entered without permission so he called the police. After the officer came and left checking things out Doug went out to the payphone outside and I followed him. He called Tom and said, ""Julie called the police I couldn't stop her."" This upset me because it was solely his idea to call police and so I went inside the house and locked the front door and I was knelt on the dining room floor throwing my clothes into my backpack because I was going to leave. 

Then I heard the sound of him kicking the front door in. Once he was in he came up to me and grabbed me and threw me to the floor. Then he kicked me in the head so hard everything went black for a moment then slowly went red. Then he kicked me again. The third time I finally got the sense to move my head away and he pulled my clothes off and made me sit there naked while he called me down. He told me my mom thinks I'm a pig I remember. He was drinking heavily then he stared scratching his wrist to make it bleed and eventually he passed out drunk. He had hidden my shoes but I found one in the dryer and I don't remember now where other shoe was but I got dressed and went out to payphone and called police. I had two black eyes really bad I do have a photo of it. Then police took him away and I got taken to shelter. 

The guy Tom came to shelter to see me and because I literally didn't know anybody else I started staying with him in his car lot and he started making sexual advances at me and took advantage of me. Then my adoptive mom contacted an agency called operation child go home and I got brought back to Richmond hill in a van full of people. I wound up with Doug after meeting up with him again in Newmarket on Eagle St after awhile. I had whats called 'battered womens syndrome' very badly. 

I did a pill od and I went to the hospital and told them I was suicidal. They put me in a room by myself that had a couch and I was to wait there to see a psychiatrist but seeing the glass picture on the wall I went over and punched it and I did a number on myself. My wrist and forearm was all black stitched after. Getting stitched up hurt more than doing it. Please if you're reading this don't ever feel like that's the answer. Jesus cares about you He actually does. Doug wound up getting me pregnant. While I was pregnant he shoved my face down into a sofa chair holding my arm up behind my back so it was nearly breaking. I ran out of the place I was like 6 months pregnant and he ran up behind me and shoved me down on the road so hard. Then pulled me back inside by my hair. I saw the ppl who lived above us watching from the window like it was a tv show. We were living in a rough area of Newmarket called the dog patch. 

I was then in more shelters because I left him taking the baby with me because he would hold the baby above his head so I couldn't feed it and he was really scaring me. I called the police from the payphone outside the convience store and they took us to Sandgate Women's Shelter and then I was put in Rosalie Hall in Scarborough where they played baby bingo in the basement and I won a stuffed tiger for my baby.

I got emergency housing while in the shelter and it was there in my own apartment with my baby that I started wondering about the truth in life and I gave my life to Jesus after going to a used book store and I found a book called Theres a new world coming. I thought the title sounded interesting and it wound up being a Bible prophecy book that taught me about being born again. (Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! 1 Corinthians 5:17)

Now I'm clean and I like to get good news cards to give out to people. This story is missing a tremendous amount of drug use such as abusing Gravol pills to get so high I couldn't walk. Like it was real bad the shape I was in. It's These scars are now a reminder of how far I've come thanks to Jesus. I wrote a poem right after receiving Jesus: 
BROKEN
I look at my wrists, I see the scars
I search my soul, I know my shame
I've been led by the blind and beaten down by sin
I should have died, but You wouldn't let them win
I see Your hands, the holes in Your palms
I know your glory has overcome all pain
I turn to You Lord, in my broken suffering
A love unimaginable, how can this be
In all my wretchedness, You reached out to save me
A soul so pure, my hero, Your truth
The word of God that whispered to my heart and set me free
As I tripped over trials, in this deathly darkness
I looked for the way
Your light opened my soul and my eyes lit up with hope
You showed me a path that I can now take
Thanks to Your selfless sacrifice
This sheep will never fade away
I toddle like a baby, into Your strong hands
I am Yours, You have made me new again
Paralized with tears, my repentance shakes my being
Then You kiss my tears away and I am no longer unclean
Thank you Father, my cross I'll bear
'Till the day I go home, when You shout from the sky
All Your sheep will run to You with a happy cry
And there I'll be, tucked safely under Your wing
As we fly away, this life will have seemed like a dream
I will never forget how You gave Yourself for me

I (28F) manage a fast casual restaurant. For some context/background I've worked for my company for around 10 years and worked my way up from a cashier to a general manager. I recently-ish (about 10 months ago) transferred stores and went from working in a corporate restaurant to a franchised restaurant that is run quite differently and has a lot of unique struggles (i.e. no money to order small wares, uniforms, etc., not being able to submit work orders for broken equipment, not having the support of a corporate office and just a general lack of structure). The restaurant I walked into 10 months ago was a disaster. They were short staffed, had no one in charge, and were quite literally falling apart. In the time that I have been there I have poured everything I have into that place to get it staffed up, get people trained, promote shift managers, and take it from a dumpster fire to a pretty well run machine. I am incredibly proud of myself because I've never been in a situation like this and I feel most people would have just turned around and ran the other way (they literally went through 5 GM's in 3 years). I also have received a lot of praise and recognition not only from my bosses but also from my team. I have always used the approach of being the manager I wish I had when I was a team member. I do not spend my days in the back ""writing the schedule"", I conduct regular one on one meetings, I do what I can to recognize my team, I decorate the restaurant each month with a new fun theme and do interactive activities like decorating mini valentines boxes or posting a ""get to know your team"" board where we all answer silly questions just as an attempt at team bonding. Point is, I try really, REALLY hard to be everything everyone needs me to be. I'm not trying to say I'm the best boss out there, I know I have quite a few flaws. One of which being that I have a hard time with confrontation and tend to be a people pleaser which can make it hard to set boundaries and standards for my team. 

Although I have a difficult time setting boundaries, one thing I have always tried to stand firm on is the company's policy for calling out of work and making time off requests or changes to availability. The policy from the handbook states that if you call off a shift you are expected to find coverage which I know can be difficult. It also states that the manager can require a doctor's note if an employee misses a shift due to an illness. In the beginning there were a lot of instances of ""I'm throwing up I can't come in"" and it started to feel like a loophole to get out of working with no consequences. This is why I started being strict about bringing a doctor's note to try to deter my staff from playing hooky (for added context we only typically have 4-5 employees per shift so being a man down really impacts the rest of the shift and makes it very difficult to run). I do not expect my employees to feel like they have to come into work sick, I've tried to maintain that yes, if you don't have a doctor's note I will write you up, but if it isn't a common occurrence then you have nothing to worry about. I utilize the write ups only so that I have documentation if it becomes a theme with someone so I have grounds for disciplinary action.  As for the policy on requests off or availability changes I ask for a 2 week notice for either as I write the schedules 2 weeks in advanced and feel that this is fairly standard.

Now for the situation at hand. It all ties in together but I don't know how I can connect it all so I'll try my best. In the past week or so I feel like the floor has fallen out from under me and I have been submerged into complete chaos. This story mainly circles around three of my employees. I'm using fake names so we will call them Lizzy(29F, manager), Abigail(20F, manager), and Mark(33M, team member). These are some of the employees that I feel I have stuck my neck out for the most which makes this all the more hurtful. We'll start with Lizzy. Lizzy is a shift manager and recently started a 4 week school program. Before she started she was adamant that she needed to work as much as possible during this time to keep up on her bills, so I scheduled her 5 days a week around her school hours. After her second day of school she immediately changed her mind and asked to be given less hours, 3 days a week max. I told her I would do that on the next schedule I write but that for the two weeks leading up she would need to find coverage if she wanted to have less hours because I had already made that schedule. She agreed. Last Wednesday she was supposed to train another employee(FOH) how to work in the kitchen. She is normally my most aggressive manager in terms of expecting people to do their job right and having high standards so I was shocked when my other team members told me that she refused to train the employee, stating that ""he clearly knows what he's doing"" and then kicked him out of the kitchen to do dishes when he couldn't keep up on his very first day. She then proceeded to ask said employee to cover three of her kitchen shifts the following week(Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) and he for some reason agreed, despite still having no training. Once I was alerted of this situation I texted Lizzy letting her know that if she is finding coverage it has to be by someone who is trained on the station and then I made a compromise with her that IF(I made it clear if and only if) I had him come in on her shift Tuesday to get fully trained then he could cover Wednesday and Thursday at least. She seemed okay with that. Long story short, he did not get the proper training due to scheduling conflicts and a sliced thumb. Tuesday, the day before the shift he was supposed to cover I let Lizzy know that unfortunately he wouldn't be able to cover her shift because he still wasn't trained and she was PISSED. She told me she wasn't coming in on Wednesday and that I can write her up. She was already on edge because the previous Sunday Lizzy got into a major altercation with another manager who she has petty beef with and I ended up writing them both up for causing a hostile work environment. Lizzy seemed to think I was taking the other manager's side for unknown reasons (I was stern with them both and wrote them both up for causing a scene).

Yesterday was Wednesday, the day that Lizzy refused to come in for. I was scheduled to work 8-4pm but had already accepted my fate that I would most likely have to stay to cover her 6-11:30pm shift and was prepared for a long day. What I wasn't prepared for was the chaos that ensued in the past two days. When I came in Wednesday morning, one of my employees started going off about how horrible yesterday(Tuesday) was. I was off and didn't hear anything from my managers so I was confused. The employee was telling me that my employee Mark didn't come in for his shift and that as a result, Abigail(MOD) was extremely stressed out and was taking it out on the staff. At that time, Mark was in the building for his shift so I asked why he didn't show up yesterday and he said he was sick and no one would cover. I asked if he had a doctor's note and he said no. I honestly just kind of brushed it off and figured I'd talk to Abigail to see if she okayed it before I did anything further but I'm sure Mark could tell I was frustrated by the situation. Mark does not speak much English, so after this short interaction he handed me his phone with a long paragraph written in Google translate that said something along the lines of ""I'm a hard worker and its not my fault I got sick. I tried to get coverage but not one would come. It is YOUR fault that I had to get a third job because you don't give me enough hours"". This honestly pissed me off because A) I never said it was your fault I just asked why you didn't come or bring a doctor's note and B) You having 3 jobs has nothing to do with the situation and it is ABSOLUTELY not my fault??? Now, it may have been the constant jackhammering next door or the stress from dealing with Lizzy but I just told him that if he feels that way maybe he shouldn't work here and if he's sick to go to the doctor. So, he left to go to the doctor. I most definitely let my pride get in the way and shot myself in the foot in this moment but I did later text him and apologize for getting angry but that I felt his comment was disrespectful. We kind of squashed our beef and I continued on with my day. I worked a very stressful 8-4, took a break and came back to work Lizzy's 6-11:30 which was actually a great shift and I was able to end my day on a positive note. During my break I talked to my boss and explained the whole situation with Lizzy (added context: in the mean time I was told by other people working with Lizzy that she has been consistently coming in late and telling them she either has to leave early to catch the bus or they have to give her a ride home. Throughout the week I just got numerous complaints about her behavior that I was mostly unaware of before. I knew she was very opinionated and confrontational but it never seemed to get this out of hand. On Tuesday night she had told the closing manager(Ashley,22F sweet pushover with a newborn baby at home) that she was leaving early to catch the bus. The other closer burnt the shit out of her arm and Ashley wanted to let her go home early but then she would be the only person left to close the store. Lizzy told Ashley that she would stay until close of she could get a ride home so Ashley reluctantly agreed so the other employee could leave. This is important later) 

Me and my boss agreed that if Lizzy does, in fact, not show up for her Wednesday shift that I had the go ahead to pull her off of the schedule for the rest of her closing shifts that week(all of her shifts). She didn't show up so I let her know that I was removing all of her remaining shifts and she had the audacity to reply with ""that's fine if anything I'm getting what I wanted. But instead of acting the way you are like if I have done this multiple times (she has) where I don't show up, how about you see that yesterday I was given the option by Ashley to leave early for the fact that I have to study for my final when I have been doing work AND school but I decided to let Sam go home early (with approval) because poor girl burned herself so bad and I didn't want her to suffer through that so be a little more understanding instead"" THIS KILLED ME. I really had to bite my tongue to not respond. I wanted to say ""okay so I should praise you for staying until your scheduled time after you manipulate Ashley to let you go early???"" Anyways I digress. I just ignored that and took her off the schedule because I didn't want her to keep causing issues for everyone else. I took on her extra shifts as well resulting in three double and 60 hours for the week but I was lowkey ready for the fat paycheck.

NOW FOR THE FINALE. Last night, despite working such a long, eventful, and stressful day (I HATE CONFLICT AND ALL I GOT YESTERDAY WAS CONFLICT) I did the best close I could! I did some of the morning tasks for Abigail and tried to make her life as easy as possible because I knew it was a truck day and her last shift was rocky. I clocked out with 15 hours, went home, had a few drinks and passed the fuck out. When I woke up at around 9 am I saw that I had 15 messages and 8 or so missed calls :) They were from Abigail. She was texting the group chat asking if anyone could come open the door for her because she lost her key. She had sent texts from about 7:40-8:40 am and finally said ""John(my boss) is coming with a key don't worry"". She had also sent me quite a few texts one of them saying ""I know you opened and closed yesterday but this is an emergency"" and a final one saying that today is her last day and she can't deal with the lack of communication, people never wanting to cover her shift, this company is bs, I always find coverage for my shifts but not hers, etc. etc. In my hungover stupor, I replied back ""ok"". I later texted her back asking why she never brought this to my attention before in our one on one's when I directly asked her for feedback and how I can support her and she just boiled it down to feeling like there's no communication. At this point I felt defeated and even \*I\* felt like quitting. I called my boss to discuss the situation and we agreed she just seems stressed and overwhelmed but that it seemed she wasn't going to budge. While we were on the call freaking Lizzy shows up in the group chat with this gem; ""This whole group is a fucking joke! She needed ONE person to help her and only gets a text back saying ok! No help whatsoever! and the ONLY person to respond was ME to let her know if I had my key I would come give it to her but I don't have it with me SMH!!"". Ngl I burst into tears in the middle of our phone call and just lost it. I told him I can't deal with these people and that I don't know what to do blah blah you get it. Anyways, I finally calmed down and accepted the situation. We decided that Lizzy is not the type of person we want on our team and made a plan to terminate her after two write ups and this outlandish behavior. This leaves me two managers down, no other opening managers, and no days off for the foreseeable future. I am also extremely hurt because I have gone out of my way on multiple occasions to try to make my employees feel appreciated. I took my managers to an escape room using my own money for a fun outing, I bring extra snacks, coffee and energy drinks with me, I do my best to find coverage for shifts even, I adjust schedules I already spent hours on perfecting for last minute requests, and it just feels all for not. I feel deflated and I want to just shut off and stop trying so hard to please everyone because it doesn't seem worth it anymore. I love my job and I love my people but this feels extreme. Maybe I'm just sensitive but I would NEVER act like this especially towards my boss.

I feel like me sticking to my standards is the underlying issue here. Like my employees feel like its unfair for me to hold them to the same standards I hold myself and everyone else to? So aitah for trying to hold firm boundaries at work?",2,1752809292.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

I am available all day Saturday-Monday and in the mornings and early afternoons Tuesday-Friday. I am willing to meet in public places (I.e., public library, coffee shop, etc.) or I am available to come to you within reason (\~15-20 miles max away from GR). If you aren't local to Grand Rapids, I am happy to set something up with you over Discord, Zoom, or a similar video calling software. 

I have a clean background and I’ve tutored several of my cousins throughout their elementary, middle, and high school years. 

My rates are flexible and I’m willing to negotiate an hourly rate for those who are struggling financially. My typical rate is $30/hr. for one student and $40/hr. to tutor two students simultaneously  ($20/student/hour). 

If you’re interested or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out via DM or by commenting on this post. From there, I can give you the email address for my tutoring service so that we can communicate more efficiently if you're interested in my contact information.

I'll share my complete guide on cleaning and descaling your Keurig, based on my personal experience.

First, let's talk about why cleaning matters. Over time, mineral deposits from water build up inside your Keurig, affecting both the taste of your coffee and the machine's performance. If you notice your coffee taking longer to brew or tasting off, it's probably time for a good clean.

Basic Daily Cleaning:
- Remove and wash the drip tray and K-cup holder
- Wipe down the exterior with a damp cloth
- Empty the water reservoir and rinse it thoroughly
- Clean the needle that punctures the K-cups (carefully!)

For deep cleaning and descaling (which you should do every 3-6 months):

1. Get a descaling solution. I always use Keurig's official descaling solution, but white vinegar works too.

2. Empty the water reservoir and remove any K-cups.

3. Fill the reservoir with equal parts descaling solution and water.

4. Place a large mug on the drip tray.

5. Run brew cycles until the ""add water"" light comes on, dumping the hot solution after each cycle.

6. Let the machine sit for 30 minutes.

7. Rinse the reservoir thoroughly and fill with fresh water.

8. Run at least 12 cleansing brews with fresh water.

If you're in the market for a new Keurig, I've found some great deals here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers. The newer models actually remind you when it's time to descale, which is super helpful.

Pro tips from my experience:
- Use filtered water to reduce mineral buildup
- Clean the needle monthly to prevent clogs
- Don't leave water in the reservoir overnight
- Consider using reusable K-cups to reduce waste

I recently upgraded my old Keurig to a newer model (found it at https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers), and the difference in coffee taste is remarkable when you maintain it properly.

Remember, regular maintenance prevents most common Keurig problems like slow brewing, incomplete cups, or strange-tasting coffee. It's worth taking the time to clean your machine properly - your morning coffee will thank you!

Let me know if you have any questions about the cleaning process. I'm always happy to help fellow coffee lovers keep their machines running smoothly.",1,1752808795.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

What a guy! After that, he became a Supreme Court justice for 15 years - gross, but also relevant to where this vignette is going.

**Powell Memo, 1971:** He wrote a confidential letter (oops) to the US Chamber of Commerce titled Attack On America Free Enterprise. It's long and boring, but I cut and pasted a link to it below. In short: *Business is under attack by the media and by the working class, it's time to fight back by mobilizing corporations politically (buy politicians), infiltrate education and media, and to play the long game.*

**Post Powell memo, from 1971-1981:** PAC's (the less evil brother of SuperPAC's) were first created in the early 70',s and money started to flow heavily into the pockets of politicians from unelected officials. Mid to late 70's marked the birth of Think Tanks - Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, and others started having influence and persuasion over the media and education. By the very late 80's (with Powell on Supreme Court) unions were beginning to lose power. There’s a lot more but Im trying to keep it somewhat brief.

**The Reagan Years:** In January of '81, Reagan was handed a 1000 Page document from The Heritage Foundation, titled Mandate for Leadership (essentially Powell Memo playbook) - it had ""over 2000"" recommendations in it to cut taxes for the wealthy, deregulate, take down unions - basically anything to help the top but hurt everyone else. Reagan adopted nearly ⅔ of these 2000 recommendations in his first 12 months in the White House. Reagan also gutted public schools, killed universal basic healthcare (google operation coffee cup), massively slashed corporate tax, and IMO the greatest offense of all: He allowed for a rule change with the SEC. Buybacks were now legal. So what, right? Well, they are a form of market manipulation and were illegal prior to Reagan. They are also a form of millionaire/billionaire socialism. That ""extra"" money used to go towards reinvestment, higher wages, and R&D. Now? It's a way for the CEO's and those with portfolios, to pay themselves and manipulate the market. In 2024, the total # of corporate buybacks hit just shy of $1 trillion dollars - but fuck you and your medical bills, am I right?

**This was all sold as Freedom and Progress!!! The opposite? Socialism!!! And we bought it up and still do today.**

So, if anyone wonders why so many more people could afford a home then, why kids were doing better than their parents, why we didn't have billionaires, why the wealth disparity wasn't nearly what we have today...its not really that hard to figure out. Or maybe I've turned into a conspiratorial nut...? Idk, never heard of this power memo up until about a week ago, and I've been deep down the rabbit hole ever since.

I'm not a socialist. I'm not anti getting rich.  I'm pro American, anti-partisan, and wish more people got a fair shake. What we had prior to Reagan was not socialism. It was Sustainable Capitalism, and unless we bring back some policies (or comparable) from that era and fast - we're going to continue to rot as a nation from the inside out.

Relationship of 2 and a half years. We felt a mutual love, we were moved by sharing details with each other, we loved each other and we planned for the future. 
The relationship was wearing down, like everyone else, but she suffered a lot. I went through a bad streak (at work, with negative energies), I stopped taking it as a priority and I accidentally neglected it.
She sought refuge in her best friend, with whom we shared plans together, she gained my trust. I trusted her a lot too.
They went running, studied together, had dinner. To me they were friends, there was no toxicity on their part. She is the typical good girl with values that can be trusted. 
Until…
They went on a trip together with another friend and when they returned she told me that she had feelings for him, and it was mutual. He was in a relationship too, and he automatically left her and she did the same with me.
From deductions I made while having coffee with her, I came to the conclusion that they have already had sex, they are in constant contact and she is still very firm in her decision not to return to me. Which shocked me a lot because for me it was sacred, it was mine and the fact that 2 weeks after cutting me I was already with him broke my heart.

The grief has already passed even though he is with me and I feel like I am dying.
Yesterday I blocked her, I feel like something was broken definitively and forever, although I am still very much in love with her and excited that a future will return. I really regret not having changed in time, if you are in a similar situation, try to do things differently, talk to her and take care of her environment.

It's a few hours drive so I had to smoke them ahead of time. I called the local butcher shop yesterday and asked if they could have 4 racks of ribs ready for me as I'd be there right before closing time as they closed about 5 minutes after I'd be able to get there. The lady on the phone asked how big I wanted them and I said, ""I don't know, full racks?"" and she didn't ask any more questions. 
I ended up with 50lbs of ribs. Two whole pigs worth. 4 racks. I froze most and threw the rest on my little Pit Boss.

I was a little concerned with the size of them so I just did the standard 3-2-1 method with whatever brand of pellets my wife picked up last time she was at Costco and hoped for the best. I spritzed the rub with apple cider vinegar until it was damp before placing the ribs in the smoker, spritzed them again when I wrapped them and then basted the ribs with the collected juices after I unwrapped them and let them sit for the last hour. Then I let them rest for an hour and then sliced off one each for  wife and I to sample in case I screwed things up.

I moved to her city (Vienna) partly because of her, but she consistently sees me as a friend despite our history. Last tried asking her out on Valentine’s Day - got a gentle but clear “no.” Five months later, wondering if I should move on or if there’s still hope.

-----

The full story:

Two years ago, I (let’s say mid-20s) met this girl during a solo trip to Scotland. We connected at a hostel pub crawl - I literally asked her point blank “Do you want to get married? Do you want kids?” She said yes to both. We talked all night, made out, hooked up in the hostel bathroom. The next morning, she had vanished like something out of a movie - already left the city.

But I was hooked. We talked every day for a month, hours-long phone calls. She eventually invited me to visit her in Vienna. I went, and we had what felt like four magical days together. But it was too intense, too fast. She got scared by how quickly emotions were developing, especially with us living in different countries.

We tried to make it work long distance but it fell apart. A few months later she sent me a random picture of Vienna. I thought it was a sign to reconnect - it wasn’t. I kept initiating conversations until I finally asked “What went wrong between us?” She said she wasn’t “sure” and it wasn’t “mathematical” to explain what happened.

Plot twist: Six months later, I moved to Vienna. Partially because of her, but also because I genuinely loved the city. I didn’t tell her I was moving, but she texted me 3-4 weeks after I arrived. We met at the same café we’d been to a year earlier.

She was radiant - I told her her “aura was yellow” (yeah, I actually said that). But I had to tell her I was seeing someone new in Vienna. She mentioned wanting to leave Vienna, which visibly hurt me. We ended on a good note but didn’t talk for five months.

Valentine’s Day 2025: I reached out for coffee. It turned into pool and too many beers. I could feel the old chemistry, caught myself staring at her. When I offered to walk her to her bus stop, she seemed hesitant - like she was worried I might try something. I didn’t.

Got home and texted her immediately: thanked her for the evening, said I’d like to see her again but as a date this time. Added that we could always just be friends if she wasn’t interested romantically.

Her response: “Thank you too, it was really fun!!! But I have to say no to a date.. you might have noticed that I’m not really in the mindset to date. And for me I enjoy having you as a friend, I would not want to change that..”

I handled it well, accepted it gracefully. We’ve barely talked since then - just occasional light exchanges.

Now (5 months later): I don’t even know if she’s still in Vienna or followed through on her plans to move. Part of me wonders if I should reach out one more time, but another part thinks I should finally let this go.

Questions for Reddit:

- Is this a case of “right person, wrong time” or am I just not seeing that she’s simply not that into me romantically?
- Should I try reaching out as friends one more time, or is that just prolonging the inevitable?

I’ve never felt a connection like this with anyone else, but I’m also tired of this two-year cycle of connection and retreat. What would you do?

So I’m only 25, but I got an internship in an industry I wasn’t even really interested in on a whim when I was in college and busted my ass to get really good at the job (worked full time in addition to being a full time student) and have been able to fast track my way to a senior-level role at the firm I’m at now. 

I understand I should be grateful and proud of myself for getting here so fast. But I’m so fucking burned out. I get messages from clients and from my boss constantly. Does not matter what time it is. I get emails and messages from clients when I am literally asleep (that is, when I can fall asleep… I can hardly sleep these days due to stress and when I can fall asleep, I keep waking up at 3am and being unable to fall back asleep) regularly. 

My client load is well above industry norms. Overtime pay does not exist here. The firm I work for now has been in startup mode since I got here, and they’re doing well, but there’s still a constant sense of instability. My role has undergone major shifts every few months over the last year, more work is added to my plate what seems like every few weeks, and I’m constantly training new people, some of whom don’t last longer than a few months. 

There have been a couple times in the last few months I’ve suddenly had a full-blown anxiety attack while talking to a client… as in my voice starts noticeably shaking, heart starts pounding, vision goes blurry. I’m a fairly seasoned public speaker and that hasn’t happened to me in all my years of interfacing with clients up to this point. I can feel myself physically crumbling under the pressure. 

I don’t feel like this is worth me having no life. I haven’t worked out in three weeks because I’m so freaking tired after work that all I do is just rot on the couch and play video games, and I’ve lost five pounds during that time because I’m incredibly stressed and I hardly have time or energy to eat(on top of the 70 pounds I’ve lost in the last year… some of it intentional, some of it not). I basically live on coffee and nicotine. I’ve been with my partner for a long time and we’re getting to the point where we should be thinking about our future and settling down, but I could never have a wedding, much less have a freaking kid when work consumes my life to this degree. 

I’ve been applying to jobs aggressively for the last two months and am in early stages of interviewing for one job but haven’t heard back from anyone else, which I feel is probably a combination of a) me being young and only having a total of 5 years of experience despite having a senior-level title and b) my experience being pretty niche. The job I’m interviewing for wouldn’t even be a step up pay wise, but at this point I don’t even care. 

I also can’t just up and quit just to take a break because the majority of my income goes toward student loans and living expenses, so I have no savings and really don’t want to have to ask my partner to help me cover living expenses because I can’t pull my weight. I also know my current firm would be totally fucked if I left, which I can’t help but feel guilty about… it’s just who I am. 

I’m literally torn between having job/financial security and not being completely miserable and I hate it. I regret so many of the decisions I’ve made up to this point. I shouldn’t have gone to a school that required me to take out loans. I shouldn’t have become the person who says yes to everything. I should have worked harder to hold onto who I was outside of this job. I feel like crying all day every day and it makes me feel like a failure even though I’m doing a fine job.

ONE.

My fascination with ghosts and the paranormal began 2 years ago. It was a cool summer night, and it was beginning to rain. Me and my friends, Dan and Todd, were walking back home from a ‘night on the town’, which isn't saying much as we live in a small Minnesota town with a population of 1,400 people.

 We were walking down Roosevelt street, despite Dan's protest. He hated taking this path home because of the decaying school that sat dormant on this street. Rumor around town was that the school is haunted. People say they have heard screaming and wailing from the school at night, but Todd says it's all bullshit.

It's a large modern brick building standing 2 floors tall and takes up the entire block. It was once a nice up-to-date school, but it closed down a couple years prior due to a dwindling student population. A year later it was bought by an old mechanic in town, and he intended to renovate it into a hotel, but the city said the school was on the verge of being condemned due to the west wing's second floor being on the verge of collapse. So now it sits nearly empty, the mechanic Charlie lives alone in the school and works out of the old auto shop room, so his investment wouldn’t be a complete waste. Charlie denies the claims of the school being haunted. 

As we walked closer to the school Dan and Todd were arguing about how ‘haunted’ the school was.

“I just don’t see why we couldn’t take a different route home”  Dan said “this area gives me the heebie jeebies” 

“This is the fastest route home, and I'm not trying to get caught in the rain” Todd replied

“It's just a bunch of small town gossip is all, this town has nothing else going on so they make things up to stay interesting” 

“I went here when I was a kid,” I added. “There's nothing scary about it. The closest occurrence we had was me almost dying of boredom a couple times.” 

“Yeah yeah very funny” Dan sighed “My brother said he refuses to step foot on this street after what he heard one night”

“Okay, but your brother is also a drunk, so who knows what he actually heard.” said Todd. 

As Dan and Todd continued bickering about how scary the school was, I heard a faint tapping sound coming from nearby. I stopped dead in my tracks, it sounded like a hand tapping on glass. 

“Guys shut up for a sec” I said “Do you hear that?”  

They slowed to a stop, and I realized the sound was coming from the direction of the school. The tapping sound became louder as if someone was beating on a window. I didn’t see anything at first, but as I looked closer into the school I saw the outline of a girl in one of the lower windows. 

“There! In-in the West Wing! Theres a- there's a girl in the window on the bottom floor!” I stammered as I grabbed my phone from my pocket. 

“Which window?” Todd asked “there's a lot of windows dude” 

“Oh Shit, there! I see her!” Dan yelled

I opened the camera on my phone to try record a video, but before I could I heard a piercing scream and I dropped my phone. 

I bent down and picked my phone up off the ground, when I looked back up she was gone. 

“Where'd she go?!” I asked frantically

“She dropped below the window” Dan responded “I don't see her anymore!” 

I continued looking around but Dan was right, she was gone. 

“Dammit” I exclaimed “I should have got that on video!” 

“I didn’t see anything” Todd stated “are you sure you saw a girl? That screech could have been anything.” 

“Yes dude, I'm sure! That was the scariest moment of my life. Now I'm ready to get the hell out of here, let’s go” Dan said, while picking up the pace back towards home. 

“Wait, shouldn't we find out what the hell that was?” I asked 

“How? Its private property?” Asked Todd “if you want to call the cops and tell them you saw a ghost girl in the school you can go right ahead, but I'm going to join Dan and get out of here, it's starting to rain” As he turned to catch up with Dan.

I cursed under my breath again, upset that I messed up what would have been the best ghost evidence on the internet. I took one more look at the school before turning around to join my friends. 

TWO.

That moment sparked my inspiration to start a youtube channel, so Todd, Dan, and I launched a channel a few months after, we named it the MidwestGhostHunters. We have been on a dozen hunts by now, with little to no evidence to show for it, but we have amassed 60k subscribers. 

The closest thing we have to evidence is a door closing on its own during our investigation of an abandoned mall. Todd is adamant that it was a draft, but Dan argues it was definitely something paranormal and that Todd is ignorant. Other than that though, all we have caught are some loud creaks and bangs while investigating abandoned houses, which I realize can easily be brushed off as nothing.

I am certain that our big break would be if we could investigate the school. Ever since word of our channel got around town, people have told me many stories regarding that building, and they insist that’s what we should investigate next. I've already tried asking the owner Charlie if I could, he said he would if he could but his insurance doesn’t want anyone else going in that building and that they are already opposed to him living there as is. So for now I have just been recording the neighborhoods stories to hopefully make into a video later. 

THREE.

I woke up this morning to my phone ringing. I rolled over disgruntledly to see Todd calling.

“What do you want?” I answered a bit harshly. 

“Well good morning to you too, Sunshine” Todd responded

“Well excuse me, It is 8am on a Saturday, what is so important that it couldn't have been a text?” I asked 

“Well, I call with good news” Todd said 

“Okay, well, what is it then” I replied curiously

“Charlie died” Todd stated a bit too excitedly 

I paused before asking “How is this good news Todd?” 

“Well it's not, but it's good for us at least. Because this means we can finally investigate the school,” he replied.

I took a moment, thinking it over, unsure what to say. I had only woken up moments ago, and now I'm being told Charlie is dead and that we should investigate his school. 

Todd added “Abby just told me. His body is going to the coroner's office this morning. An officer found his car wrapped around a tree, they suspect it happened last night.” 

Todd's wife Abby works for the city, so of course she has the inside scoop.

“There’s a slight hitch though,” Todd added. 

“What's that?” I asked 

“Well Abby tried to notify the next of kin, but all that he had listed was some guy down in Oklahoma. She told him the news, and he told her that he would be coming up in a couple days and that he is going to buy the school when he gets there.” Todd said. 

“That's odd” I added “he has quite the list of priorities I guess. What would he want with a condemned school anyways?”  

“I was wondering the same thing” Todd said “but regardless that means we would have to investigate it soon, before the buyer gets into town.” 

Todd was right, we could investigate the school now that Charlie is dead. It probably isn’t very considerate but it's a possibility nonetheless, and we wouldn't get another possibility like this again. 

“Okay, I’ll tell Dan,” I said finally “we will investigate the school tonight” 

FOUR.

It was well after dark as we approached the school. It's even more ominous when we are this close, especially when it is bathed in the night. The building looks weathered yet surprisingly current, and besides for the paint flaking and fading away, it looks just as I remember it from when I was a student. We crossed the empty parking lot and as we got to the front doors Todd spoke first “Sooo do we just walk in through the front door, or did anyone make a plan for how we get inside?” 

I looked over to Dan and he gave me a small shrug as a response. 

I responded “I guess I didn't consider that part. I put too much thought into whether or not we should and didn’t think about if we even could.” 

Dan let out a light chuckle saying “I was more worried about if it's more or less illegal to break into a man's house after he is dead. Is it still breaking and entering if he is dead, or is this just trespassing?” 

“I'm no lawyer, and I'm barely a ghost hunter, but from a legal standpoint, i'm gonna say maybe” I joked

“Well he did say he would be okay with it if it weren't for his insurance” Todd replied “who would we sue now if we got hurt?”

“Okay, that's a reasonable point I suppose” I said trying to make myself feel better about this potential crime “but we better figure out a way inside here soon, I don’t want any cops to see us. Anyone have any ideas?” 

Todd bent over and grabbed a large rock. 

“No, put that down dude” Dan said in a hushed shout “That would definitely be breaking and entering” 

“Well, do you have a better idea?” Todd asked

As Todd and Dan squabble about the most acceptable way to break into the school, I approached the front doors. I put my hands on the doors and gave it a little push, and to our surprise they actually opened. 

“He left them unlocked?” Asked Dan

“I guess” I responded “it is a small town after all, maybe he didn't plan to be out for long.” 

Todd and Dan entered the building behind me. The doors closed behind us and we could hear the sound echo throughout the vast building. We turned on our shoulder lights, the school still has power running to it, but we don’t want any neighbors to see the lights on.

The school has an odd aesthetic to it since it is now redesigned to be a home. We stood in the entryway which is a large open hallway now designed as a very open living room. There were a few display cases along the nearest wall that now holds Charlie's shoes and coats. The room has a few couches and an older TV, neither of them seemed to be used in a while. 

“You guys ready?” I asked as I pulled out the camera. 

“Yes, but please don't do your regular intro for our video” Todd pleaded

“Why not? I've done it for every video” I asked

“Dude, it's annoyingly stereotypical. If this video does blow up our channel like you say it will, we can't have that type of introduction for the new viewers” Todd stated

“Okay well do you want to do the introduction then?” I asked him. 

“Well no, that'd be even worse” he said

“Okay then. I’ll do the introduction my way then.” I stated

I turned the camera around to face me and hit record. “Good evening Midwest Ghost Viewers, we are back again with another investigative video. Tonight we are investigating my local school. This building is a bit of a local legend, there are so many terrifying stories about this place, so we just had to investigate it. So get ready to start believing in the paranormal, but before you do, don’t forget to like and subscribe.” 

I hit pause on the camera, and it  was followed by a deafening silence in the room. I could see Todd and Dan holding back laughter. 

“I agree with Todd, that shit sounds pathetic dude” Dan laughed finally

“Yeah I know” I said “It always does.” 

“That one hurt,” Todd chuckled while shaking his head. “Can we go explore now with that out of the way?” 

“Yes please” I said dejectedly 

To the right of the now living room is the gymnasium, and to the left is the swimming pool, we elected to explore the gymnasium first. 

The gymnasium didn’t appear to be altered at all, it also didn’t appear to have been used lately, the bleachers are dusty and the floor looks as if it hadn’t been swept in at least a year. 

I pulled out my camera to record some footage while we performed our tests. Our investigation usually starts with an ouija board, most ghost hunters claim this is complete BS, and honestly we agree, but it does provide some good content. We didn't get much if any movement from the board this time, besides for Todd trying to spell out P-E-N-I-S a couple times. The next test we like to try is the spirit box, Todd absolutely hates this device, and I can see why, but Dan is convinced it is legit. We let the spirit box run for a while. Dan said he heard some related words, but I think he was really stretching his imagination, because all I heard was incoherent nonsense. I usually check an EMF reader while we investigate, but it was very unreliable tonight due to the building actually having power for once. And speaking of power, the air conditioner scared the hell out of us a couple times during the testing. We are used to it being dead silent and we fine tune our ears to pick up any noises, so when the AC roared to life we all jumped.

Once we agreed we weren’t getting any evidence in this area we walked across the hall to the swimming pool. The room is humid and smells like chlorine despite the 12 foot pool being drained. The hot tub had a couple renovations from the last time I had seen it, there is now a TV mounted nearby and a new minifridge sitting adjacent. We ran a few tests in this room as well, with no proof yet again. 

We wandered over to the locker rooms which are just outside of the swimming area. We entered the men's room, and it appeared to be well used. I assume this was Charlie's main bathing area based off of the fresh towels sitting in the lockers and dirty laundry sitting in a hamper in the corner. The sink has a couple of new drawers built on to it, with his toiletries sitting on top. We didn’t stay in here for long or record any video, as it felt invasive even though he was gone. 

I stepped back into the hall and took an awkward glance into the women's locker room. 

“Hey bud, what ya looking at?” Dan asked, ""Is this how I find out you are a pervert?”

“I'm just curious, haven’t you wondered what a women's locker room is like?” I asked 

“Sure, but it’s probably the same as the men's just without the urinals, and maybe different paint” Todd stated

“Okay well don't you guys wanna find out, now is our chance” I said 

“Sure I suppose, why not?  Let's go peep in the girls bathroom” Todd said while walking in. 

When we entered the locker room we were surprised and speechless from what we saw. The women's room also appears to be well used, but by girls, which was concerning because Charlie didn't have a wife nor kids. The lockers contained towels and girls' clothing, ranging from children's size to adult. The doors on the stalls were removed. 

Todd broke the silence by saying “What- the- fuck. Are you guys disturbed by this as well” 

“This is definitely concerning, this doesn't make any sense” I replied

“Why would Charlie have girls' clothes here, and why so much? It’s just him that lives here.” Todd asked 

Before I had a chance to reply Dan shushed us. His eyes wide with fear, and stammered “I think I just heard someone knocking” 

“As in? Knocking how” Todd asked still focused on the locker room

“Like when you knock on somebody's front door politely waiting to be let inside” Dan said 

“Could it have been old pipes maybe?” Todd asked still looking around the locker room

“No, it definitely sounded like a hand knocking on a door. As in knock knock, who's there” Dan said “I'm telling you guys-”

Knock,Knock,Knock

He was interrupted by the knocking, it must have been louder this time as Todd and I both heard it clearly. Dan was right it definitely sounded like someone knocking on a door, even Todd looked like he agreed. 

I turned my camera on and we stepped back into the hall. 

I asked “is it coming from the front door? Did someone find out we are here?” 

“Maybe,” Dan said “it's so hard to tell, the building echoes so much” 

I started cautiously walking to the front door when we heard it again. 

Knock,Knock,Knock

“That sounded like it came from down the hall” Todd stated 

“That leads deeper into the school, that's the hall that brings you to either the West or East wings” I said

“Well I don't like that,” Dan said as the three of us began walking down the hall. The hall felt as if it was a mile long, and it felt like I was running one based on how hard my heart was beating. I'm excited that this will be the first bit of actual evidence we have ever gotten, but I am also terrified.

 We finally got to the end of the hall, there are two sets of double doors on either side of the hall. The right set of doors are open, they lead into the East wing which is the high school, assumedly where Charlie used to live. The left doors are chained shut, they lead into the west wing which is the elementary school, that is the condemned wing so that's probably why they are chained shut. 

“Which way do you think it came from” Todd asked

We got our answer as we heard another Knock,Knock,Knock to the left and I saw the west wing doors shake and bind against the chains. 

I slowly approached the doors and asked “Hello, who is it?” with false confidence. In response we heard a quick pattering fleeing from the door, like little footsteps running away in a game of tag.

We sat in silence for a moment, my confidence quickly fading.  

Dan pushed on the doors and said “we have to get into the west wing, there is clearly something back there. Do you think Charlie left a key somewhere” while he pulled on the lock.

“Maybe” I replied “but actually the East and West wings share a lunch room, so the two sides meet up again at the cafeteria, maybe those doors are less secure and easier to break into.” 

“Well let's take a trip through the east wing then” Todd said “before that critter gets away.”

We all shared a look of agreement, and headed through the high school doors.

FIVE

The high school appears to be more taken care of, the carpet looks recently vacuumed and the walls have been repainted. We walk through the vacant halls, passing by empty class rooms. I recorded some more with the camera, while Dan and Todd were bickering yet again.

Dan said “there is no way you actually think that was an animal back there” 

“It had to be” Todd responded “what else could it be? A ghost? A ghoul? Some sort of monster maybe?” 

“We are GHOST hunting, so yes I do think it could be a ghost. That is the whole reason we are out here, that's what we are trying to find” Dan stated

Todd stayed quiet, probably because Dan has a pretty good point.

“What kind of animal do you think it was then?” Dan asked half jokingly 

“I don't know, that's why we are going over there. It has to be something pretty big though.” Todd said unconvincingly

“Oh come on dude, seriously? Do you hear yourself right now” Dan asked

We passed by the auto shop, it lay empty which seems odd to me. The shop hasn’t changed much, besides for the addition of Charlie's tools. The room is fairly dusty, but it's hard to tell if that's out of the ordinary for auto shops. The attached classroom is renovated into an office space. A newer computer sits atop his desk with a few file cabinets sitting along the nearby wall. We searched the office for his keys, but we found nothing, so we kept heading for the cafeteria.  

I led us through the next corridor, and through a shortcut through the library. It has been remodeled into an oversized living room area. A couple couches and a reclining chair sat around a large TV with a nice sound system. A couple of the bookshelves now hold an extensive collection of movies and CDs. We planned to come back to this room and investigate it further after we checked out the west wing. 

We took a quick detour to explore the principals’ office which is now Charlie's bedroom. The layout reminds me of a small apartment, there's a waiting room when you first walk in, which connects to Charlie's bedroom and main bathroom. It is well decorated, the waiting area has a couple plants sitting in the corners of the room and the walls are arranged with posters of old metal bands I don't recognize. His bedroom is also well kept, the bed is made and his nightstand seems organized. We searched this area as well, but did not have any more luck finding the keys. I was beginning to worry that he may have had the keys on him the night he died, but I tried to push that thought away as we continued our expedition to the cafeteria. 

We finally arrived at the cafeteria, it is a spacious room lined with rows of long tables. I looked closer at the tables and saw something that troubled me. There are about a dozen lunch trays loaded with food sitting on a couple of the tables. The food looks to be only a day or two old. I point it out to the guys, and Todd seems equally troubled by it. We were confused about why Charlie would need so many trays for himself, but Dan walked by us clearly more interested in the doors that connect to the West Wing, expressing a bravery we haven’t seen from him before. He stepped up to the doors and gave them a push, they are locked, so he took a couple steps back and before either Todd or I can protest he kicks the doors open. 

We caught up to Dan and I said “Y’know a heads up would have been nice”

Dan replied “Well we couldn't find the keys and I don’t know of any other ways in, so how else were we going to get into the elementary school?”

Todd said “I don't know dude, you didn't really give us any time to weigh our options.” 

“Okay well it's too late now, so why are we wasting time debating how to get through the doors when I've already kicked them down.” Dan asked smugly 

“Okay fair enough, you make a good point. Let's go then.” Todd said, leading the way into the elementary school. 

Before following them, I record a quick extra bit of footage of the cafeteria, still troubled by the lunch trays. Eventually I turn back towards my friends, hurriedly closing the gap into the West Wing. 

SIX.

The West Wing is more neglected, but still holds the appearance of an elementary school. Most of the rooms still have the old desks and classroom decor, but are covered in a heavy layer of dust. This side of the school smells musty and stale. All of the windows on this side are boarded up. The walls are painted pastel colors and the floors have colored lines which lead to different portions of the school. We saw no obvious signs of what was knocking on the door earlier, so we decided we should walk back to the first set of doors, in hopes that we might find something closer to where the knocking first occurred. 

As we got deeper into the elementary school, I noticed something. The West Wing is in very nice condition, it looks clearly abandoned, but it didn't appear to be on the verge of collapse like Charlie said it was. I mentioned it to the guys. 

“Hey, does this wing look very condemned to you two?” 

They paused to look around, Todd said ""I'm no building inspector, but I would agree, this wing does look pretty nice so far, I wouldn't condemn it.” 

Dan commented “I thought Charlie said it was the second floor that was dangerous, we haven't made it up there yet.” 

“I guess” I said “but I assumed there would be damage on the first floor as well, if the second floor was about to collapse.”  

They just shrugged and continued exploring.  

As we traipsed past the computer lab, Dan stopped us silently raising a hand. 

“What's up? Why are you acting all black ops right now?” Todd whispered

“Do you hear that?” Dan asked “do you hear that humming?” 

We fell silent and I heard it. It's a sing-songy type of humming coming from within the computer lab. We exchange nervous glances, and I lead the way slowly prowling into the room. The lab has numerous computers lining every wall and a couple rows down the middle. I can hear the humming clearer now that we are inside, but I can't quite make out the song. We can’t see the source of the humming right away, so we split up to get a better look.

 I slowly approach one of the middle rows. I apprehensively looked under the desks, and I discover what is singing. A young girl is crouched under the desk on the far end. She's wearing a dirty stained nightgown and her hair is matted. She is rocking back and forth slowly, and I can now hear her whimpering “they need help” as she hums. I froze, unsure how to proceed. She must have felt my eyes on her because she quit humming and sits still. Slowly she turns her head to look at me. She looks me dead in the eyes unblinking, and lets out an ear piercing raspy shriek. I jump back terrified and she leaps at me. I narrowly avoid her, but I somehow manage to drop the camera as she runs by me and towards the door. She ran into the hall screaming, “YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE!” and “GET OUT!” 

I look back at the guys, they both sit petrified. 

“Guys! Snap out of it, we gotta follow her” I yell while picking up my camera off the floor. Thankfully it still works. Dan rushed to my side and we ran into the hall in the direction the girl fled.

We rounded the corner at the end of the corridor and see the girl standing completely still with her hand pointing towards the stairs. I stop and pull out my camera, recording clear footage of the girl. 

She whispers “they are up there, please help us.” 

Dan said “fuck this dude, im out. We got our footage, that's enough for me.” and turns around racing towards the nearest exit.

“Dan! Wait!” I yell pleading 

I turn back towards the girl, but she’s gone. Nervously I look around for her, I see fresh footprints in the dust that lead upstairs, but I'm not about to go up there alone.

“Yeah fuck this” I agree and run back the same way as Dan. 

I found Dan and Todd back in the computer lab. Todd shook out of his horror, but he was still spooked. I approached him saying “It's time to go buddy. I got our footage, let's leave”. Dan nodded in anxious agreement, leading us out the door.

We quickly retrace our steps back to the cafeteria. I am a bit concerned about Todd, I've never seen him this quiet before, but Dan is able to escort him out ahead of me. 

We made it back to the cafeteria without event. I turned back momentarily to close the doors behind us, then we paused briefly to catch our breath. 

“What the hell was that?” Dan asked, still rattled.

“I think that was our first ghost,” I said excitedly.

“Once we get out of here I can't wait to say I told you so” Dan said playfully pushing Todd

Todd laughed anxiously “yeah, I guess you guys are right. I think that was actually a ghost. Did you get it on camera?” 

“Oh yeah I did. This video is gonna blow us up. The footage I got is perfect, I’d dare to say the best evidence on the entire internet” I responded

“You guys ready to go home so we can get that footage posted then?” Dan asked 

“Yes I am very ready to get the hell out of here” Todd said.

We headed back the way we came, following our footsteps through the highschool, through the once home of old Charlie. I still have a lot of questions after this expedition, but for now I'm focusing on getting home. 

We made it through the high school easily, and got back to the hallway that divides the west and east wings. I let out a sigh of relief as I saw the entryway doors at the end of the hall. I took a moment near the West doors to look at the chains, when the door slowly creaked open and rattled as it bound against the chains. A face now peering at us through the gap. As soon as I locked eyes with her, the doors began to violently shake, and I heard a girl's voice yelling and crying “LET US OUT, PLEASE. Please, you have to set us free. Help us.” She started pounding heavily on the door and continued pleading, but we already began running in the opposite direction. 

We barged through the entry way doors, and I was half tempted to kiss the ground as I stepped foot on the parking lot. I looked around at my friends, their faces mixed with emotions partially excited but also terrified. We recorded a quick outro outside of the school, I'm unsure if it will be usable since we are so clearly shaken up. Dan gave a couple middle fingers to the old school, but Todd and I didn't look back. Finally I put the camera away and we got into my car, relieved to be heading home, and ready to post the video of what we found. 

SEVEN.

It didn't take long for the video to blow up like we suspected. I spent the entire next day editing the video so I could post it as soon as possible. I was able to post it on Sunday night, just a day after our investigation. By Thursday the video was on the trending tab with a million views. Our channel blew up, gaining a half of a million subscribers already and didn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. We received a dozen DMs from other creators asking to collab or to ask us for the location of the school. But one DM stuck out in particular, it was from an individual named Josh. He was insistent on getting information about the girl we saw. 

Josh: Hey guys, my name is Josh Henshaw. I just saw your video and I know this may sound odd, but I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about the girl. Its urgent 

His message made me curious so I agreed.

“Sure, what do you want to know about her?” 

Josh: Did you happen to see her eyes? If so, what color were they?

“I didn't really get a good look at them, it was too dark in there”

Josh: How about her right forearm? Did you see a scar shaped like a dog bite on her arm? 

I didn't remember much about her arm, so I looked back at the footage. I start by rewatching when she leapt at me in the computer lab. That's when I noticed something. I didn't drop the camera, she knocked it out of my hands when she jumped at me. I could clearly see her hand hitting the camera, and it was the same arm Josh asked about. I took a closer look at her arm and saw she did indeed have a dog bite shaped scar.

I sent another message to Josh, “Yes she does have a scar on her arm. How did you know that?” 

Josh: I thought that was her. Please, you need to tell me the location of the school. I can meet you somewhere if you don't trust me.” 

“I'm not telling you anything more until you tell me how you knew about her scar” 

Josh: Okay fine. I know about her scar because I think the girl you saw in the school is my missing sister.

There is a photo attached to the message. I opened it and saw a missing person poster, the girl on the poster looks exactly like the girl I saw in the school that night. Her name is Lucy Henshaw and she went missing nine months ago from a nearby county. 

I replied to Josh immediately with my phone number and gave him the location of the school. He told me he doesn't live too far from here, and we agreed to meet at my apartment tonight and then go to the police with our findings. 

EIGHT.

I stand outside the school once again with Josh, Todd, and Dan; but this time the school is bathed in flashing red and blue lights as the sun is setting behind it. The school is surrounded by what appears to be every police officer and EMT in town. The officers breached the school just moments ago and we were told to wait in the parking lot. 

Josh made it into town earlier this evening. As soon as he came into my apartment I knew he was telling the truth, I could see it in his eyes, they looked just like Lucy's. We skipped all formalities as he told me all the details of her disappearance. After I answered all of Josh's questions we went to the police station. 

  We told the story to the officer at the front desk. Officer Andersen didn’t seem to be convinced with our ghost girl in the school story, until I showed him the video and Josh pulled out the missing persons poster. Andersen put on his glasses to get a closer look at the girl, and saw that we were serious. He showed our proof to some of the nearby officers, they unanimously agreed to start an investigation. 

Then a couple hours later we arrived here. We weren't technically invited to join the investigation, but no one stopped us either.  

We sat in the parking lot for what felt like the entire night, but according to my watch it has been only 45 minutes. The sun has fully set by now and the night sky is beginning to take over. 

Finally the front doors opened, one of the officers exited the building with his arm around Lucy. Josh ran up to her as fast as he could without frightening her. Lucy watched him tensely until she recognized him, then she smiled and fell into his arms. He said something to her but I was out of earshot and I didn't want to intrude. 

The front doors opened again and two more officers walked out, holding a couple of young girls in their arms. The girls are gauntly thin, they look sickly but are alive nonetheless. The officers rushed them over to the ambulance. Todd pointed me to the front doors again and I saw three more officers rush out with girls in their arms as well.

I overheard the two officers talking to the EMTs “there are a couple more girls inside yet, Andersen is working on getting them free right now. One teen and one adult. These girls were chained upstairs in the elementary art room.” 

The other officer pointed to Lucy and said “that girl gave us quite the scare in there, she was the only girl not chained up. She said she escaped her chains last week and hit a ‘bad man’ with a brick, but she hasn’t seen him since.”

The three other officers approached the ambulances, setting the girls on the available gurneys, and asked how they could help. An officer named Lincoln turned to us and told us he is going to take Lucy back to the station to treat her there, and see what else she is willing to tell us tonight. Josh and I agreed to come with. 

NINE.

By morning a lot of my questions became answered.  Lucy was very open about her experiences in the school. She was very brave, with encouragement from her big brother Josh. She started by telling us that she tried to hurt Charlie with a brick because he was a bad man, but she couldn’t hit him hard enough and he dragged her back upstairs. That was the night that Charlie got into a car accident, Lincoln is going to look further into the autopsy but suspects Lucy gave him a concussion and that caused him to veer off the road as he was driving to the hospital. Eventually Lucy was able to escape her chains again, but couldn’t escape the West Wing since the doors were locked and the windows are boarded up. I felt pretty bad for closing the doors behind me as we fled that night. 

She also told us that Charlie has been kidnapping the girls from nearby towns. Lincoln pointed out that most of the girls rescued from the school are in the missing persons databases of neighboring counties. He showed the database to Lucy and she was able to point out a few more girls that used to be at the school but were picked up by another ‘bad man’. She said he comes from the south to pick up the girls who don’t behave. I told Lincoln about the man who was listed as Charlie's ‘next of kin’ that Todd mentioned last week. Lincoln pulled up the man's information and found his photo. He showed the photo to Lucy, she cried but confirmed it was him. His name is Arnold, and he even looked like a creep. He should have made it into town by now according to my conversation with Todd. Lincoln had his doubts that he would show at all, but said they would keep trying to reach him until he is caught. 

Later when the IT department went through the computer in Charlie's office and they validated what Lucy said. They found hundreds of messages between Charlie and Arnold that revealed a bigger trafficking ring led by Arnold. At that point they turned the case over to the FBI for a large-scale operation.  

That was the last of officer Lincoln's questioning. Then the on-site nurse gave Lucy a quick evaluation. Lucy said she felt fine, so the nurse told her to get plenty of rest over the next few days and drink plenty of water. Lucy asked about the other girls in the school; the nurse said they are all going to be okay and that the officers are reaching out to their parents now. 

Finally Lincoln said we are free to leave, but we have to stay in town until the investigation is complete. I extended an offer to Josh and Lucy to stay at my place for a few days, which they accepted. We left the department grateful for all they have done, but hopeful we wouldn't have to return any time soon

We arrived at my apartment before noon. Before I could even offer my bedroom to Lucy she was asleep on the couch. Josh fell asleep on the recliner adjacent to her, unwilling to leave her side. I left two glasses of water on the coffee table with a note telling them to help themselves to anything in the kitchen. I walked into my bedroom and turned on my computer. Officer Lincoln told me to delete the video of the school for the remainder of the investigation. I wasn’t sure how long that would be, so I began writing my experiences here while the memories and emotions are still fresh. Surprisingly my Youtube channel no longer feels as important. I have new friends to care for now, along with my old ones. Maybe a break from ghost hunting will do me good, because I certainly found more than I was hoping to. 

So that’s all for now Midwest Ghost Viewers, until next time. Thank you",3,1752807694.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False
1m2r7fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1m2r7fp/heres_a_collection_of_wild_shit_what_happened/,Here’s a collection of wild shit what happened when I worked in the cafeteria at a hospital:,"This is long.. but I’ll make it simple. 

-A nurse left the cafeteria bathroom without washing her hands. 

-A doctor yelled at me because we were out of butter while I was refilling coffees, filling trays with a line of customers out the doors, and putting out new food. 

-A nurse made me cut her pizza for her while staring at my hand in a brace. I sprained my wrist the night before, I couldn’t move it. I cut her pizza so shitty lol

1m2qzo8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m2qzo8,ALL NEW R3BEL CRT Delta Skins  for N64 complete with REFLECTIVE BEZELS and OVERSCAN! For iOS!,"**\[R3BEL CRT PORTABLE\]** for iOS  [Download \[R3BEL CRT PORTABLE\] for N64 Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Im-MHX7If_Fo1J9wG73NXJvbfJb0uNMd?usp=share_link)

***\*\* Highly Recommended to read through the*** [“READ ME” file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wDBp0r4CumA-YiCDGMq5xeIacXcNaCzY/view?usp=share_link) ***through this link. It thoroughly explains the details of these skins and also has a list of recommendations for which skin to use for specific games. \*\****

Another one that has been in the making for a while and they’re finally ready! These N64 skins are some of my most complex skins to date! They are CRT style skins that use Core Image Filters to distort the game screen to create a bubble style screen similar to the old CRT televisions. They also feature a reflective bezel, mirroring the game image on the inner edges of the screen bezel. They are definitely not perfect CRT's, but seeing that Delta does not support actual third party shaders this is the closest I could get.

**RELEASE NOTES:**

1. The CRT PORTABLE versions have complete control sets to play on the go  
2. iPhone versions only supports edge-To-Edge iPhones (phones with no home button) 
3. In addition to the labeled quick utility functions there is also a hidden ""Hold to FFW"" button on top of the game screen/display  
4. Due to the complexity of the N64 controller I had to remove the QuickLoad button from the Landscape layout. However, you can still flip to portrait to use the QuickLoad in the time of need ;)
5. In addition to the standard Z and R buttons there are additional “convenience” Z and R buttons to help with certain games.
   * For example, the added “convenience” Z button in the middle of the C-Buttons cluster to make it easier to play Banjo Kazooie to its full potential. Also helps in some racing games, and with Goldeneye 007. While using the c-buttons to strafe you can easily tap in the center to fire your weapon. 
   * The added “convenience” R-button along side the A-button is to make it easy to access your shield in Zelda Ocarina of Time, or to drift/hop in Mario Kart 64, and makes for a quick/easy way to adjust the camera in games like DK64 or Conkers Bad Fur Day while moving your character.
6. There are hidden combination buttons between the A+B, A+Z, and B+Z buttons to help with games like super Mario 64 and all the combo jump buttons.These buttons are mapped to overlap the primary buttons, but they are layered below the primary buttons which allows you to slide between buttons without losing contact with the original button pressed.  

**OVERSCAN & PER GAME RECOMMENDATIONS** 

***\*\**** *These skins have only been tested and designed for the NTSC / US Rom files. Using Other / PAL formats may or may not look as expected.****\*\****

**What is Overscan? -** Overscan on a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) television is a display setting where the image is intentionally zoomed in, causing the edges of the picture to be cut off and not visible on the screen. This was a common practice on older CRT/Tube TVs. 

**Delta N64 Emulator Overscan -** N64 games were designed by game developers to be played on CRT displays which causes some games to have black bars or borders that show on the game emulators like Delta. 

* These skins with “Overscan 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0” are designed to simulate the same behavior to help hide those bars and give a more authentic play experience. 
* Each of these skins have different levels of cropping applied to the game screen image. With “no overscan” being as implied, no cropping at all. While “overscan 3.0” has the most cropping in from the edges. 
* Please see the last image in this post for a comparison of Banjo Kazooie with No Overscan skin vs the Overscan 2.0 skin. 

* *If you have any requests for specific games to crop out the black borders that these do not work for. Please let me know.*  

As always, feedback is always welcome. Good, bad, or ugly. all is welcome ;)

If you've known me or reading my posts for the past few months you must be slightly aware (given I caught your attention) on how terrible my sleep cycle is. I'm the type to stay awake till 0700 than to wake up at 0700.

Long story short, everything boiled down to some funny chemicals not working right in my brain and I've been under scrutiny for a tiny while now and will be for a little longer.

So, yesterday night was the first time I felt sleepy without any external help, as in medication (but I took them cause I had to keep the course going) and eventually slept before 2300. That is NOT normal for me. And I woke up by 0645 this morning which is also NOT normal for me.

This might not seem a grand thing for most of you, but for me, not relying on others or alarm clocks to wake up and stay awake, wash clothes is everything, at this point.

I REALLY hope I stick to it, and when I do, I'll come update you again. Not like you want an update, but this space is precious for me, so writing here brings me joy. 

Also yes, I am still washing my coffee mugs immediately, or atleast on the same day :)

After countless hours of research and personal experience, I've figured out what works best.

For small spaces, round or oval coffee tables are usually the best choice. They create better flow since there are no sharp corners to bump into, and they make it easier to move around in tight spaces. I recently helped my sister pick out a round coffee table for her studio apartment, and it completely transformed her living room.

Square tables can work too, but they need more clearance space around them. I've found that if you're going square, it's better to choose one with rounded corners. You can find some great options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

The height of your coffee table matters just as much as its shape. I recommend choosing one that's about the same height as your sofa cushions or slightly lower. This creates a balanced look and makes it comfortable to reach for drinks or remote controls.

Here's what I've found works best for different room layouts:

- Long, narrow rooms: Oval coffee tables
- Square rooms: Round coffee tables
- Open concept spaces: Any shape, but round tends to look best
- Tiny spaces: Nesting tables that can be tucked away

Storage is another crucial factor in small spaces. I've seen some clever designs with hidden compartments and lift-top surfaces. These are perfect for storing magazines, blankets, or even laptop chargers.

The material choice can also impact how spacious your room feels. Glass or acrylic tables create an illusion of more space since you can see through them. I was skeptical at first, but after seeing one in my friend's apartment, I was convinced.

If you're interested in exploring different options, I found this collection particularly helpful: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables. They have a great selection of space-saving designs that work well in smaller rooms.

For those really tight on space, consider these alternatives:
- C-shaped side tables that slide under your sofa
- Ottoman coffee tables that double as extra seating
- Folding tables you can store when not in use

Remember, the key is to maintain about 18 inches between your coffee table and seating. This allows comfortable movement while keeping everything within reach.

I've found that the right coffee table can do more than just hold your drinks - it can make a small space feel more organized, functional, and welcoming. Take measurements of your space before making a decision, and don't forget to consider how you'll actually use the table in your daily life.",1,1752806366.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The characteristics of a genuine bear claw extend beyond simply what meets the eye. Quality ingredients combined with expert technique yield a product that is both visually appealing and exceptionally flavorful. These key elements contribute to the overall enjoyment of the pastry.

**Flaky Pastry:** The foundation of any good bear claw is a perfectly laminated, buttery pastry. This involves layering dough with generous amounts of butter, folding it multiple times, and then resting it to allow the gluten to relax. The result is a light, airy, and incredibly flaky texture that shatters with each bite. A well-made laminated dough should have distinct layers noticeable both visually and texturally.

**Almond Filling:** The conventional filling for a bear claw is an almond paste, typically composed of ground almonds, sugar, and eggs. This filling should be moist, slightly sweet, and intensely almond-flavored. Some variations use a frangipane, which is a richer almond cream made with butter. Regardless of the exact recipe, the almond filling should be evenly distributed throughout the pastry and not be dry or grainy. High-quality almond extract helps contribute to a distinctive flavor within the baked good.

**Almond Topping:** Genuine bear claws are invariably adorned with slivered or sliced almonds on top.These almonds provide a textural contrast to the soft filling and flaky pastry. The almonds should be toasted to a golden brown to enhance their nutty flavor and crispness. The visual appeal of a generous layer of almonds is undeniable and a crucial part of the bear claw experience. Freshly cut slivered almonds are best for ensuring a uniform size and shape to allow for even toasting, especially in the oven or in a confectionary plant surroundings.

**Glaze (Optional):** Some bakeries add a light glaze to the finished bear claw for extra sweetness and shine. This glaze is typically made from powdered sugar and water, sometimes with a hint of vanilla or almond extract.A well-applied glaze should be thin and evenly distributed, adding a glossy finish without making the pastry overly sticky. The glazing adds a sweet component that compliments the almond paste and gives the bear claw an attractive sheen and shine.Key features of the Genuine Bear Claw include:

*   Buttery laminated Dough.
*   Authentic Almond Filling.
*   Visible Toasted almonds.
*   Light, non-sticky Glaze.

## FAQs Section

Consumers may have questions on what makes an authentic and reliable bear claw, or may need specifications for dietary considerations or allergen data. Here are a few common questions.

**Are genuine bear claws suitable for individuals with nut allergies?**

No, traditional bear claws contain almonds. They are not suitable for individuals with nut allergies. Some bakeries might offer nut-free alternatives, but it's crucial to confirm the ingredients and preparation methods to avoid any risk of cross-contamination.

**How should genuine bear claws be stored?**

Genuine bear claws are best consumed fresh. However, if you need to store them, keep them in an airtight container at room temperature. They can also be refrigerated for a longer shelf life, but this may affect the texture of the pastry. Warming them slightly before serving can help restore some of their original flakiness.

**Can genuine bear claws be frozen?**

Yes, bear claws can be frozen for later consumption. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap and then place them in a freezer-safe bag or container. When ready to eat, allow them to thaw at room temperature or warm them gently in an oven or microwave. Freezing and thawing can slightly affect the texture, but it's a good way to preserve them for later.
