[The elder didn’t like to be photographed. “He allowed himself to be photographed only for people who were really sick or were going to die soon,” says Nicholas Mentesidis, who knew the elder very well, and would drive him in his car from Athos to Souroti.     ](https://preview.redd.it/qkazhemz3jyd1.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=e014a8243f1cdc0f02b194fb4167e0596fa18cec)

*The path to Athos is open to men only. But in Greece there is a women’s monastery where they live according to strict Athonite rules and serve without electricity, by candlelight. This monastery, in the village of Souroti, was founded by Elder Paisios the Athonite, whose books have been so popular in the past few years in America and Russia. A correspondent of the Russian Orthodox journal “Neskuchnii Sad” headed to Souroti to meet with people who remember Elder Paisios.*

**“I Was an Atheist”**

“When Elder Paisios would visit the sisters at the Monastery of John the Theologian, thousands of people would come see him. I went especially to see how the swindler was cheating them all. I was an atheist. This was in 1988. The service had started. The church was divided into two parts: for laity and for nuns. There was a taut rope between the two sections, and I didn’t know that I couldn’t go in, so I crossed over. There was an elder sitting among the nuns, whose face radiated light… Seeing this, I left, but two days later I came again, for a blessing. Then I went to Athos and so remained with the elder for life,” recalls Nicholas Mentesidis, a jeweler who knew the elder.

There are many such stories, of when the first, and sometimes the only encounter with Elder Paisios changed somebody’s life. They talk about it especially often in Souroti, a quiet village outside of Thessaloniki. “Many who knew the elder have moved here—closer to the monastery,” claims local postman Polikletos Karakatsanis. “You would think in vain that everyone in Greece is a believer—statistics say otherwise: only two percent of the ‘Orthodox’ regularly commune. We try to live close to one another, holding onto God and one another.”

https://preview.redd.it/00dhay034jyd1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3607cd3de8906b562f5eb8eaa6575dfb6d3e25d

On the road to Souroti, they sell small church-chapels, as tall as a man (like our cabins or baths). You can buy thse chapels and put them near your house or in your olive grove. Judging by their number, there really are many believers in the surrounding villages. “Fr. Paisios told me,” recalls Athanasios Rakovalis, the author of a book on the elder, “that to avoid sin in our difficult times, we must hold fast to the Church. The farther away, the more people will be lukewarm: The people are divided—those who leave the Church go far, but those who remain with God will be zealous.”

**Zealots**

For the residents of Souroti, the nuns of the Monastery of the Holy Apostle and Evangelist John the Theologian serve as a model of zeal. More than half of the sixty-seven sisters well remember Elder Paisios. He helped them write their monastic rule and spiritually guided the monastery. The answers to questions, published in Elder Paisios’ books, were addressed precisely to these nuns.

The nuns avoid communication with the outside world, and don’t give interviews. It’s no accident. Elder Paisios is greatly popular in Greece, and some unscrupulous politicians and journalists use his authority, distorting the elder’s words to their benefit, to give weight to their ideas. “Moreover, Geronda believed,” says one of the older nuns, “that any participation in secular life, including communication with journalists, can hurt us.” The elder wrote, “If a monk is constantly occupied with external things, then he will unavoidably go wild spiritually and not be able to sit by himself in his cell; even if they bind him, he’ll always like to talk with people, to lead excursions, talking about the domes and the archaeology, showing them the pots with various colors, and making them meals.” “We do share our wealth though,” the nuns emphasize, “by publishing the notes of our conversation with the elder and his letters!”

They distribute books on the elder, printed in various countries, in various languages, to inquisitive pilgrims to read. The library is in the guest house, in a special room for meeting guests. There, settled in with a book on a bench, you can have a cup of coffee and try some sweet loukoumi.\[1\] Treating guests with loukoumi is an ancient Athonite tradition which they also follow in Souroti. They say that in less populated monasteries, they put out a jar of sweets and hide in their cells, thus fulfilling their duty of hospitality, but not meeting with tourists.

**Filthy loukoumi**

There’s a large olive tree growing near the path to the church. On Sundays and feast days, one of the older nuns holds a conversation in its shade with the visitors. They usually sit around in a circle on some stumps and ask the mother some questions or listen to her stories, and sometimes recollections of the elder.

https://preview.redd.it/yg7cv2pb4jyd1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2fdc7f9716d2bc4e968ac242fecf71cca3fa5d3

Fr. Paisios often spoke with pilgrims just the same way, on the benches. When the elder would visit Souroti, although he would try to hide the time of his arrival, many people would come—cars were parked in the neighboring village of St. Paraskevi, two kilometers away. “After speaking with the elder, people would feel peace and comfort in their souls,” says Athanasios Rakovalis. “Many smelled a sweet fragrance during these meetings; many, and even I myself, have seen his face shining; but it’s not people that have glorified the elder, but the Lord Himself.” For instance, Souroti resident Kaliopa tells a story: “My friend and I went to see the elder. When our turn finally came, he was so tired that he couldn’t even speak. We silently approached, and the elder blessed us with some crosses: He gave me five—my family has five people, and to my friend he gave four—her family has four people. And we didn’t even say anything!”

“One day I realized I was asking the elder something I had already asked, because I couldn’t remember the answer,” recalls Athanasios Rakovalis. “Then I started recording the conversations in a notebook. People found out I was gathering recollections to publish them, and they began telling me their stories. For example, one man had filmed an amoral film and was living in luxury. Someone told him about the elder, and having decided that the elder was a charlatan, he went to Athos to confront him. When he entered the kalyvia, the elder treated his guests with loukoumi. He gave everyone a piece, but in front of this man he threw the loukoumi on the ground and said, “It fell. Pick it up and eat it.” Of course, the man was offended. “How am I going to eat that off the ground—the loukoumi is filthy!” The elder answered, “You also feed people with filth.” The man was so shocked that he ran out of the kalyvia, but the next day he returned and spoke with the elder alone. The elder told him to quit his dirty work, and so he did, and now this man is a pious Christian.

The elder was never angry and never irritated. If someone tried to anger him, he would say he had a headache or some obligation and leave, so as not to offend anyone. But one time he got seriously angry at me. I went with a friend, and we wanted to stay and sleep in the elder’s yard. It started to rain, and I dared to ask the elder to pray that the rain would move. The elder drove us both out of his kalyvia with the words, “Who are you to know God’s plan? If God is satisfied with rain now, it means the rain is needed now—what a big responsibility to care for the whole earth and to arrange rain at the necessary time! And what kind of plan do you have? You say, ‘I want,’ and don’t think about anything else?” However, when we left the kalyvia, I turned and saw that the elder was blessing us with the sign of the cross.”

**How not to sleep**

In the guest housing, where I was staying, there were five young girls (men could not stay on monastery territory). Three cheerful girlfriends, students of the pedagogical university in Thessaloniki, Evangelia, Barbara, and Anna, often came to the monastery on the weekends “to pray and get some rest from the big city.” All three were planning to eventually get married, but they loved the monastery life: They went to the services and looked for obediences “to help the sisters.” Two other girls, Elena and Christina, came individually and were very quiet, and would pray for a long time in their rooms—they were obviously inclined towards the monastic life.

“I fall asleep during the long services,” Barbara honestly confessed, “but if I don’t go to church at all, what’s the point of coming here? Although I know how not to sleep—you have to stand on your feet the whole time. It’s hard, so I sit in the stasidia,\[2\] and… fall asleep.” They serve on the new calendar in the monastery, as everywhere in Greece, but according to the Athonite rule, without electricity, with candles, and they serve the full services. In the morning, the services begin at 4:00 and end at 10:00. However, there isn’t always Liturgy. It’s served by priests invited from Athos only on Sundays and feast days. Many commune at Liturgy, although, as is customary in Greece, without Confession. Confession happens in the monastery at individual times. The spiritual life of the community follows the gerontissa, who hears the sisters’ revelation of thoughts and determines how often they should commune.

The evening service is short, except when the All-Night Vigil is served, which literally lasts all night. But usually the services go from 5:00 to 8:00 PM, including an hour break for dinner, as on Athos.

The monastery church is divided by a rope. When there are too many parishioners, the nuns, not at all annoyed, condense and move the rope closer to the altar, so it wouldn’t be too crowded for those who come. Women stand on the left and men on the right. The women don’t have head coverings but they are always in skirts; if you come in pants you can get a skirt at the entrance to the monastery—it’s a rule commanded by Elder Paisios.

https://preview.redd.it/3zg415s74jyd1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e3ebadfce70e07bb4605fa24cfe064fe243b1bf

There are stasidia along the walls of the church, but no rows of cushioned chairs, which is usual for Greek churches (just folding chairs for the infirm). “For the Greeks, the church is like one of the rooms in their house,” says one observant pilgrim from Russia. “On the one hand, he feels the need for it and his responsibility for it, but on the other hand, ‘at home’ he usually wants it to be comfortable and easy: pants, chairs, short services.” But Elder Paisios strictly denounced any kind of “Church comfort:” “If every monk had his mama near, taking care of him, of course it would be a comfort,” he wrote to the sisters. “And if we put a tape recorder in the church to play the sounds (prayers), then, of course, it would give us rest, and it would be an even greater rest if the stasidia were turned into beds. And no doubt, it would be nice for the ascetic if he had a little machine specifically for moving around his prayer rope, and a doll-ascetic who would fall and get up, doing prostrations for him, and he could buy himself a soft mattress, to lie and give some rest to his suffering flesh. Of course, this all brings relief to the flesh, but the soul is ravaged and becomes unhappy, leaving it only with feminine emotions and disquietude.”

**Trapeza—part of the service**

The nuns eat only twice a day. The pilgrims have an easier life: They are offered an additional light breakfast after the service, then also milk and cookies in the afternoon, and also little things like coffee and loukoumi, and you can take this whenever you want throughout the whole day. The monastery trapeza, painted with frescoes like a church, is located in the sisters’ building. First the nuns go, and then the guests are seated in the appropriate places.

Meals consist of one main dish (cooked beans, boiled grains, or pasta) and appetizers (olives, cabbage salad, feta cheese). The dishes are made of metal. Everyone gets another small plate for extra food if the portion isn’t big enough for you. For drinks, there is a pitcher of water—there is no coffee or tea anywhere. They don’t drink Greek coffee at all, except when they’re sick with a cold, for which they usually even sell it in drugstores. For dessert there is fruit, honey, and oriental sweets—all divided into portions.

The local pastry chef is very talented—Greeks love sweets. A box of sweets from a good confectionery is received as a valuable and welcome gift. “Once, when I was with the elder, fifteen young people came to him at his kalyvia,” says Nicholas Mentesidis. “They brought some oriental sweets with them as a gift for him, each in a big box. The elder, as soon as he saw them, not letting them in the yard, told them to exchange the boxes and receive them as a blessing from him: “George, give to Demetrios, Demetrios to Kosta…” he directed. Then he made sure that every last piece of candy was eaten, and said, “Why did you all bring me something I don’t need, so I had to take care of it?”

During the meals, one of the sisters reads the lives or teachings of the saints from a special high cathedra, which they call an ambo here. “The reading depends on the situation in the monastery; we read whatever is relevant for the community at any given moment,” says one of the older nuns. The reading ends at the ringing of a bell, everyone stands, they pray, and the pilgrims leave first. “During trapeza, everyone bears in mind that the service hasn’t ended,” explains one of the nuns, “therefore the general mood is not relaxed. Trapeza is not a rest after the service, but part of it.”

I’ve read everything I could. Watched every review I could. 

And I’m still torn. 

First time I’ve drunken coffee that I’ve appreciated was during  trip in Italy, saying to myself : that’s real coffee taste. Since then I’ve had nespresso for a long time, then a full automatic Melitta TS Duo. Jura full automatic at work.

Anyway, home real espresso will be new to me. I’m a bit of a geek. Always wanting to understand what’s behind. But I hate to feel limited and I’m more of a “buy once cry once”. But I feel that in this topic, there is no limit 😅. 

Usually we would drink 2-4 coffees in the morning (mixed of Americano/long black, espresso and latte). Single dosing decaf in the evening. 

After much reading, i get it that grinder is more important. Seen nice comments about Eureka Mignon Zero, EU made, that’s a plus for me. Niche is too expensive for what it is to import to continental Europe. 
Varia VS3 looks nice too, attracted by the magnetic bits. 
But well, I want this ability to grind coarser and finer, change beans, and have that reproductiveness throughout the journey. 

I think I’m pretty sold on a Mazzer Philos. Eu made, magnetic bits, low retention, easy cleaning, nice stock burrs… 2,5 times the price of a varia or a mignon 😅

What I’m still hesitating a lot is the machine :
- Lelit Bianca : end game for me. Almost fast heat up, flow control. 1800€ here. Is that too much or a machine for us? Water that stays too long in the boilers? How’s the water for americano ? Spitting everywhere ?It certainly lacks an “easy mode” for my wife. 
- Lelit Mara X v2 : small footprint, praised by everyone. I would pair it with a group head thermometer but it would piss me off if at anytime I would have to wait for it to heat up back or cool down to pull my next shot. Again, how’s the hot water ? Also heat up is very long. Still no easy mode for my wife. Main advantage : +-900€
- Ascaso Steel Duo Plus : is that all I need ? Lightning fast heat up, nice kit, instant steam, double PID, non spitting hot water. More easy for my wife. Preinfusion and volumetric dose. But no flow control, very limited preinfusion, no blooming… Noisy vibrating pump +- 1900€

What comes and leave my mind every now and then and then : 
Lelit Elizabeth : apart from the look and the “non refined appliance”, dual boiler, ability to pull shots and steam anytime. Heat up quite fast, non spitting hot water…  No flow control but preinfusion (and blooming) programmable, timed dose that should be ok for my wife once bean is dialed in. But man, that’s not a sexy machine. +-1000€

Ecm synchronika is too expensive, don’t see advantages to the Mechanika. Don’t like much the profitec… Sanremo Cube would be nice also but again expensive compared to a Bianca. Ascaso Baby T is a nice also but big and expensive. 

So I’m a bit lost within all this. Any thoughts guys ?",1,1730571002.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

","25M, So recently about 2 months ago my girlfriend of 1.5 years 25F, had a falling out, she broke up with me over some homelife disagreements. I said I would work on myself, I have severe social anxiety and some other issues. I spent too much time on video games. Regardless, I was the one doing everything in the house. For some back story, my GF has severe depression and is on 450mg of bupropion, she rarely leaves the bed. I literally dress her in the mornings. Its hard to even convince her to shower if she isn't feeling well. I carry her around and drive her everywhere. I am the only one doing all the chores. I cook dinner, do all the dishes, all the cleaning, all the laundry. On top of all this I treat her like a princess, when its dinner time, I will do 10 trips to the kitchen because she forgot a straw, a glove (She can only eat certain foods with gloves on,) extra soy sauce or salt, etc. I believe she has minor autism. She has 10x the amount of clothing I do with hoarder tendencies, buying 7-8 amazon packages of unneeded things. Especially with animals, she went on a massive spree to try and breed mealworms for our few reptiles that now spans our whole living room, our coffee table is covered in mealworm bins. She buys bulk of everything, she ran out of gloves to eat with and bought a 20 pack of 500 count gloves. She wears 3 outfits a day sometimes, a PJ outfit, a work outfit, and an after work outfit. Meanwhile I am having to do 7 loads of laundry every 2 days for 2 people. Which is fine, I can handle that. But then she gets mad when I don't fold all the laundry. She says she wants her socks matched up and put away in a bin, mind you, I am the one dressing her and finding her socks. Anyways fast foward, I was working on myself for 2 months, I got a counselor, made good progress with my social anxiety, but then I kinda regressed. My GF began going out to bars with coworkers until 3am immediately after work. I would like to add we work together at the same office and spend 24/7 together, so needless to say this was odd. On halloween night, she goes out alone to halloween party. I didn't know this at the time, I believed she was out with friends. I asked her why she didn't take me? She says ""I don't wana be the one to try and make a stiff pole look normal in a club."" I was hurt. Next morning she says shes working from home. I decide to go into work, get my laptop and come home too, there was chores I could work on while home. We had just gotten bonuses at work so I was suggesting date ideas for the weekend, she was just completely silent. Wouldn't speak or look at me. I finally confronted her. ""you have been doing out to bars and now you wont talk to me, what's wrong?"" Her - ""I'm done, I can't do this anymore, I don't want to be someone's parent telling you what chores need to be done."" I was upset. She left for the office. Curious, I did some snooping on her computer. I found out on the nights she was out, she was seeing some guy with a PHD 1 on 1 multiple times and texting him privately. I was more angry than sad. We have a house and pets together so now I'm going to move out in 2 weeks. Originally I wrote 3 pages of letters to leave for her as she never wants to talk to or see me in person again. I started leaving small notes around saying phrases like ""I love you,"" or ""<3 our initials."" It spiraled out of control to like 60+ notes hidden in every corner of everything in the house. Like she will probably be finding them for years. It might have been a little over the top passive aggressive, but I think its deserved. Now to move on with my life, I'm honestly not upset about the situation, if anything the loneliness is the hardest part, going from being around someone 24/7 to being alone.

TLDR: Depressed, Hoarder, Autistic GF wants me to do everything for her, broke up with me when I wasn't doing 200% of the housework, found out she was cheating, so I left 60+ ""I love you"" notes around the house before leaving.",1,1730570930.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

She's just woken up, still is a bit drowsy, has messy unbrushed hair, hasn't washed her face or put on any makeup, is wearing a stained baggy hoodie, baggy pants and her dirty sneakers aren't even laced, she's going outside to get a coffee at the bar next door - and she still looks like a pretty woman. She doesn't have to wear a dress and a ton of makeup, doesn't have to try to hide her husky morning voice, because it's not about presentation. It's about her. She can do whatever, but she's always herself, always a woman. 

That will never be me. Even if hrt does miracles for me, I get all the surgeries I need, somehow circumvent my learning issues and voice train, and my brain magically stops being mentally ill, I will never reach that point. The bar will always be so much higher for me. Cis women complain about the pressure that they feel from modern beauty standards all the time, but they don't have to struggle with being seen as women. 

This isn't a ""male to theyfab"" case, I still very much want to be a woman. It isn't shame over presenting femininely either, I'm not afraid of being seen as a woman. It's just that I want validation that I'm seen as a woman no matter what, but it's simply not true. It's an unreachable goal. I always ask myself, maybe I just want too much? I wasn't able to answer this question to myself before. Now I can. I want too much, I want something that simply isn't possible. At this point I don't even feel sad about it, I just feel numb. The question ""why me?"" has been replaced by ""why not me?""

I can't say that I don't get jealous of real women anymore, I still do. I've just stopped caring so much, crying over impossible things is stupid. I'll never be like them. I just want to know why. What determined them being them and me being me? What could I have done? It has to be my fault. I've been living in suffering and it's all my fault. I can't complain about a lack of knowledge or something, other kids had it worse than me and still got better results. I ruined my own life, but I don't even know where I made a mistake... Maybe it's because my entire life is just so full of mistakes that I don't even realize I'm doing things wrong. 

This was supposed to be a diary entry, but for some reason I'm typing it here. Idk what I want to hear. I know I'm right, I know people will say ""you're a totally valid real woman"" (hugboxxing, lies, deceit) or say ""omg same idk what to do about this either"" (cool ig, doesn't make things better). I know exactly who will comment here and what they will say, I've been here enough to see that it's the same empty words every time. They wouldn't bring me peace even if they were real, but knowing that it's basically an automated response just fills me with disgust. It's like I'm posting this into an empty subreddit filled with bots who only say one thing...

I’ll be in Svalbard for 8 days in mid-November. My flights were really, really cheap for the exact days I’m going. I’m planning some excursions, but I know I’ll have a ton of free time. I’m planning to just cozy up, read, study Norwegian language, go to coffee shops etc. 

I run around 6-10 miles per day, which I don’t plan to do outside for obvious reasons. 

All this to say, my hotel doesn’t have a gym, and I saw there is a maybe a community gym in town? I can’t get the website to translate, so what’s the deal with visitors/guests? 

Also, other ideas for what to do to keep busy would be great!

1gi2cf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1gi2cf2/lost_my_best_friend/,Lost my best friend ,"This is going to be a long explanation. I had a best friend who I lost about two years ago and I’m so sad about it. We met on our first day of nursing school and drove to nursing school to together and basically arranged our schedules together and then we started hanging out outside of school going out and we got very close very quickly and even when we graduated, we were still really close, like she knew my husband she would babysit my son. She knew my family and vice versa. And it wasn’t just surface level is very deep. We can fight each other. We help each other and it was a true best friend. I stopped working at the same place as her and, we got a little distant, but I kept putting an effort fast-forward to my life having some real life problems. My mom passed away and my husband struggles with addiction and there were some other issues. I had a friend that she didn’t really like and I just created problems, but I distance myself from that woman For good reason. I kept asking why we weren’t hanging out or if there was something that I did or something in my life that wasn’t OK or if there’s anything I could apologize for and she kept saying no, and this basically came to a argument conversation last summer, and I finally stood up for myself, and I finally voice my opinion in a very straightforward manner when I had previously expressed myself three times saying I feel hurt by the distance. I feel like there’s something that happened and I would like to talk and this was ignored dodged, and any plans we made she canceled, the thing I think she disagrees with my life, but never I’m in a derogatory way towards her. I always loved her and supported her worldview and personal choices were different. I’m OK with that. However, my life was so heavily judged and it made me really offended. And the man of our friendship I was always the one that reach out and say hey are we OK or hey I’m sorry that comment or hey is there something we need to talk about? She has never taken initiative to smooth things over and, it really hurt so deeply to the point I cried about it for six months and I recently wanted to meet with her to get coffee to make amends. I did not want to rehash the friendship. I don’t want to restart the friendship I don’t want to be her friend anymore. I finally had a point where I am OK. She canceled on me because her 18-year-old daughter had to get her wisdom teeth out, and it really showed me where I stand because those appointments are made really far in advance and to me she doesn’t have the guts to meet with me in person and having an adult conversation and she’s been avoiding me for, two years for this now and I’m struggling and I’m mad and I wanna know if I’m in the wrong",1,1730570463.0,lostafriend,2,1.0,False

My Electronic Viewfinder Interchangeable Lens camera (it's definitely EVIL and not as nice a camera as my film camera) has a sensor revolution of 24 MagicPixies and a colour depth of 16 bits per Pixie. (16 bits of what? I don't understand this technical stuff, I'm a Photographic Artist.)

Some simple arithmetic tells me that this would give me 100 24 MagicPixie files per scan layer which (which according to Apple Intelligence on my iPhobe Pro Max 16) is a total of 2400 MagicPixies per scan layer. I feel three scan layers would be best because, for me, it resonates with the rule of thirds; I am open to advice on this since I understand some films have another layer for capturing emeralds, some have a ramjet layer, and others may have a overcoat as well. 

As a passing thought, why does film need an overcoat? It seems to me that, being produced in up-state New York, it should be used to the cold?

My question is: Using this setup, which Leica lens on my Sharkskin MP will enable to me to get the optimal tonez and grainz from my Portia shots of Italian cafe coffees and Japanese beaches?

A while ago...

I woke up, fixed my coffee, prepared for that perfect sip, but before it could happen? Disaster. (Why can't I ever just enjoy my coffee in peace?)   
For context? I sit in my chair with one leg tucked under me and my dachshund between my legs, but on this day? My foot felt...weird. Honestly? I assumed the feeling was MS related and began absentmindedly rubbing my heel.   
Without looking, something dry flaked off beneath my fingers. I assumed the C3PO walk I did from kitchen to living room sloshed coffee out of my mug. 

After a few seconds though? I glanced down and saw the wrong kind of brown.  
  
Surely, I was seeing it wrong. No way that was...streaked across my heel like that? No. It couldn't be. I lifted a finger to my nose. OMG! IT WAS! IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I FEARED! DRIED S HIT!  
  
How?! When!? OMG!! It was on my fingers! On the chair! On my foot! HOW! I would've known if I stepped in anything warm and squishy.  I. Would've. Known. If I stepped. In. S hit! Of course, my S/O came to the rescue, and while I was doing the 'theres s hit on me' freak out? He asked a question that would haunt me for minutes to come.    
  
""How did shit get up the side of your foot?""  
  
Eager to avoid hand and foot disease? I hobbled into the bathroom and scrubbed myself silly, but it didn't matter how clean I got. There was no washing away that question. *How did shit get up the side of your foot?* It plagued me. I KNEW I hadn't stepped in anything. If I had? I surely would've tracked it through the house. Which, okay. I kinda did, but....  
That's not the point.   
The point is...I DID NOT step in shit, so where did it come from? How did it get on me? Last I checked? Feces didn't just poof into existence. (Get it POOf. LoL) It came from a pretty specific area, and I hadn't shat myself, that day, so.....WTF?!  
Determined to solve this Scooby-doo poo mystery, I sat down. My dog settled in my lap ready to help.

I looked down, fear stopping my breath. No. It couldn't be. 

Cautiously? I forced my lungs to work and took a whiff.   
  
Nothing. I sighed with relief then noticed my S/O watching. Jokingly I said, ""Pup probably has shit on her ass.""

S/O stayed positive with his reply, ""Nooo. She's fine."" I hadn't smelled anything, so he had to be right, right? Pup couldn't  be the brown dog culprit. It was just a coincidence. Well, the longer I pondered? The less comfortable I was having pup on my person. With a sense of absolute dread? I asked S/O to check pups' booty, and sure enough. He found the source of the brown juice. 

Just call me Sits-With-S hit cuz that's what I did.

While we’re wrapping up, she introduces me to this guy (25M), who’s also onboarding but on a diff team. So, We were talking, but then – I see his eyes. And damn, his eyes and his hair? Had me in a chokehold. We talked a bit, I wished him luck, and that was that.

A few days later, we start doing the casual “hey, what’s up” greetings, no biggie. And I didn’t even *know* I was crushing on him until my friends started teasing me about it. Usually, my crushes don’t last – they’re like, here today, gone next week. But this guy? Yeah, he was different.

Fast-forward to July, I’m on a trip to Matheran with my friends, completely gone on drinks, and apparently, I’m out here crying, telling my friends I can’t live without this dude and they should tell him I like him. I thought it will pass eventually.

Then a few weeks later, he added me on Instagram, and we started chatting. One time over dinner, he tells me he’s into coffee and cigarettes – and, plot twist, so am I. I casually mentioned it, and ever since then, he’s basically been buying me coffee and cigarettes and It’s been 5 months now, and I’ve dropped so many hints I feel like I'm a walking neon sign. But the guy just... doesn’t get it. Like, he’ll ignore me *sometimes* but then will randomly send flirty reels that leave me questioning my whole existence 😭😭. 

One time, I tried to tell him I came out to him , and he just hit me with this, “That shouldn’t matter, I’m happy you know who you are; Sab ka apana apna hai” type of answer. Real calm, very unbothered. I thought he’d ghost me after that, but nope – he reached out to me.

There’s no other way to begin this other than to first warn you that I think way too much. And I can’t even put that into words for me to fully convey to you just how much I do think. Not even think sometimes. It’s just that there is so much racing through my head and it’s a migraine in and of itself. I want it all to stop. I want to think, or to be, no more. It’s just an ever-moving, ever-shifting complex of thoughts and daydreams and conversations and ideas and they all intertwine and intersect and they just won’t ever stop.



I’m lazy. Incredibly so. I feel so heavy and sluggish and weak and pathetic and I just don’t want to ever get up. And I get it, I just need to. I just need to get up. I need to get my life in order. I need to do this, and do that. I need to stop dwelling on blah blah blah. Well, you let me know when you find the drug that makes me capable. I feel sorry for myself but won’t work to change what’s bothering me. You think there’s any chance of changing the man I am. I wish there was. I want to change. I do. But I don’t think I can. I need to get out of this house I am miserable.



My family is miserable, too. They are so hateful and bitter, and everything that gets said is always said in such a passive-aggressive way. My brother spends his life on his computer. He’s ruined his posture—teeth have gone to shit—and he usually comes downstairs for black coffee, maybe biscuits, or otherwise dinner and to go to and come back from work. He did buy himself a bike recently, so there is that. However he’s a raving facist. “Women, pink jobs, I ain’t doing that, don’t ever date a black person, gay is unnatural, yada yada yada…” My dad has such a downtrodden view of pretty much everything—which is where I suspect I get some of my thoughts and feelings from—making comments on my brother that ultimately push him to remain on that computer and to never come downstairs for concern of being patronised or berated. I try to act differently than my dad. I’m gay, and my brother knows. He thinks it’s unnatural and he also doesn’t believe I am because I’m only sixteen. Puberty, anyone? Wet dreams? No? Listen, I’m no expert, but respectfully, Wonder Woman is boring. (look, if you think it’s unnatural, that’s your prerogative, I try to accept everyone’s opinion even if I don’t agree with them, it’s just, having been in them shoes, some of the things I hear in regards to gay people and how I’m ‘just doing it to be different, wrong, etc’ make my balls explode with rage, truly) REGARDLESS, me and my brother still have a solid relationship, even though he can be challenging and super ignorant sometimes. I would never say anything to him that might sting, cause I like to think I see through his barrier and into how hurt he in fact is, unlike my dad. My mother is more the type to dismiss everything. My dog has heart problems as we have just found out. Her go to response? ‘Yeah, but…’ NO. NO BUTS. Are we just gonna wait for him to keel over to finally admit that ‘yeah, okay, maybe he did…’?! Madness. Absolute madness. How can you all be this insanely ignorant? How can you all be this insanely bitter? May not sound like much, but trust me, you put these three in a room and oh lord. They are like three disfigured gears that can, apparently, power the most dysfunctional machine in all of creation. Dinner is just such a colourful picture. We are talking Homer strangling Bart levels of grace. I tend to just keep quite, and ruminate on how much I hate them all. Not always my brother though he’s far from innocent. I guess I am already bitter. I am writing this in a low mood as of this current time.



Who am I kidding, I am definitely bitter. And this isn’t something that needs to get defended for the sake of me putting this out there.



I don’t even know what I want anymore. Death? A way forward? I am truly without direction. Thing is, I feel my heart just dying every so often. On occasion it just stabs, and I feel myself wanting to cry but still I don’t. I know that sounds dramatic, but I used to be quite the high achiever, however I now do very little at all. I used to write. My writing now is broken up by far too many periods I feel. It’s stagnant. I nitpick on some of the words because they don’t feel right. It doesn’t come out making much sense, so apologies. And it’s just a classic case of OCD. I can no longer draw either. It’s as though the lines bend and bow every which way other than where I want them to go. Like the moment the lead hits the paper everything goes wonky. I have bad acne (though I might get accutane soon SO #buzzing). I’m shaving all wrong, no doubt. Paranoid. And I’m just without energy or motivation. I do want to die. The thought of no longer having to deal I find warming.



Everything is just so negative. I try to get up. I try to do right by me. But thoughts arise that know exactly where to attack. Doubts and insecurities and anxiety and my own self-image all beat me down. And they do this so well, because like I say, I think way too much. I know where to hit myself. I know how to score bullseye and win the game against me. I just laze around thinking all the time.



My mood swings from extreme lows to extreme highs. One minute I’m gonna be fine, and the next I’m removing the razors from my sharpners.



I’m emailing samaritans. I have me a counsellor. I’ve taken up Jiu-Jitsu. But between that and the domineering weight of everything I cannot fucking move.



I need to be working so that I can escape this shit home. How can I, when every piece of offered advice I will doggedly turn away from? When I cannot work with the brain that I have?



Let me tell you about a behaviour of mine that will really throw you through a loop. I might have ADD or something similar. Between TikTok psychiatry and Google rabbit holes I don’t know. What I do know is that I like listening to music all the time. I derive some sort of pleasure from it. Like something really nice—like chills—spreading up my body from my legs (but not always exactly like that). It works by me thinking up a scenario that I want to be thinking about, and then engaging with it to the music. For instance, I once when I was fourteen developed this attraction to Carl Grimes, so I simply imagined myself entering scene in some truly kick-ass way. I decided upon the (spoiler warning for The Walking Dead, because I am courteous—you never know when someone’s just begun watching it) >!prison scene with the governor right before he kills Hershel!< and typically, the pattern of the scenario would involve me appearing from behind and serving justice. HOWEVER, there was one key difference. I usually liked to imagine myself as Carl’s identical twin. In fact it was more enjoyable that way. I’m not sure why. Talk about freaked behaviour. But this same behaviour has been present with me for as long as I can remember. Something about the music, and moving to it, and imagining such scenarios—they strike a wave of pleasure across my body that I engage with all the time. Even when not listening to music. My brain gets a-running and I lose focus on reality.



It’s getting so bad that I actually am always feeling out of touch with reality. Still, it’s so addictive for me. I never want to give it up. And by this point, with it so ingrained, I don’t know how to give it up. Is it even something that needs to be given up? SO many questions. No answers. I can’t find anyone similar. Maybe everyone is similar. Maybe I’m weak.



Which is why I suspect ADD, or ADHD. I’m pretty introverted. I have social anxiety too. Though I never used to be like this. My life used to be looking up. Not so much now.



I guess I’m looking for Reddit psychiatry too now, though of course, I doubt this will do anything.



I want to be able to move again I guess. I just don’t know how.

1gi1zsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar1/comments/1gi1zsr/my_never_ending_cycle_all_i_need_is_a_good_nights/,My never ending cycle (all I need is a good night's sleep),"Hi. I'm 33, male. I made my self-diagnose in may, when suddenly I caught myself extremely agitated (now I know it was mania) and extremely depressed at the same time, and couldn't eat anything. Two symptoms I've never experienced before. I went as soon as possible to my psychiatrist, who, after some resistance, was convinced and prescribed me a mood stabilizer. I sought therapy as well.

Before that I was already taking Wellbutrin and Vyvanse for more than three years, for depression and ADHD.

After trying Lamictal, than lithium, than Lamictal again, and reducing my Vyvanse dosage, I was taking Wellbutrin SR 150 mg twice a day, Vyvanse 50 mg, and Lamictal 100 mg when I decided (with the approval of my physician) to increase Lamictal dosage to 150 mg, because of some depressive thoughts.

The problem is that after four weeks of hard mental fog and some short term memory problems, I realized Lamictal should be the culprit. So the doctor got me back on 100 mg (yes, I'm very sensible to this drug). And it indeed was the problem. I realized I've passed an entire month laying on the couch.

It was great to be able to feel emotions again, to want to do things, and to have my mind back. But as soon as I went into this good mental state, the fear of a new hypomanic episode came back. And, unfortunately, I was right. The cycle usually goes like this:

1. suddenly everything is great; I have energy; I can actually do the things I want to do;
2. some subtle symptoms of hypomania show up, like this tension in the body that feels like an extreme urge for physical activity (it is very annoying when you don't want to exercise); I start to talk more, etc.;
3. my sleep gets worse; even if I sleep all the 7h-8h I need, I wake up feeling like I haven't slept enough;
4. the sleep deprivation destroys my mood and my concentration; I argue about anything; I hate everything that moves or don't move;
5. I start to search for reasons I'm not sleeping well; maybe it's the caffeine, the Vyvanse, or maybe I need more melatonin; maybe I ate too much or maybe I ate too little; maybe I need better sleep hygiene; maybe I need more physical activity or maybe I exercised too late in the evening;
6. I stay in this irritated hypomanic (or mixed?) episode for a very long and exhausting time until I get normal or depressed (most likely) for a couple of days.

And then comes the obvious question: **the sleep deprivation triggers hypomania or the hypomanic episode worsen my sleep?**

After the diagnose I realized I've been trapped in this cycle for more than two years. Every small change in my daily life causes my sleep to worsen and then the cycle begins. It can be an extra cup of coffee, a new food on the diet, etc. Or it's not anything at all. I never know exactly what was the trigger.

I'm still figuring out the ideal medication. Lithium is not an option, because 600 mg of it gave me extreme fatigue and nullified the effects of Vyvanse (my ADHD is severe, I depend on it).

I'm aware that my case may be seen as particularly difficult because of the stimulant/activating medication (Vyvanse and Wellbutrin). But I really cannot give up on this two meds. And the hypomania really wasn't there before I increased the dosage of Lamictal and then got back to 100 mg.

I tried trazodone some 18 months ago. Even though I was prescribed one pill, I took only one third of it, and nevertheless, the grogginess was still there when I went to sleep the next night. I cannot live like a zombie.

Maybe I just wanted to blurt out. I don't know if anyone can relate and have anything to say. If there is any success story of sleep regulation without the use of antipsychotics or meds that transforms us into zombies, please tell me. I'm eager to hear it.

P.S.: Sometimes I think I just need to take a sleeping pill like Ambien (never took it) only for one night so I could regulate the sleep pattern and get out of this never ending cycle.",1,1730569510.0,bipolar1,0,1.0,False

1gi1y8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1gi1y8p/trapped/,Trapped,"One day I wake to find I’m in a completely different brain, one lacking the sprawling maze of sunlit corridors once relied upon, instead finding myself cruelly bricked into a single dark room closed off from every good feeling and every positive thought, and as a prank someone has removed the furnace. 

“Here again,” I think. I try to go about life as before, but it doesn’t work. 

“Maybe I just need some self care,” I say hopefully, “maybe I caught it in time and it’s not too late.” I run a bath, make a pot of the nice coffee reserved for guests, read a book, take a nap. Instead of falling gently into these familiar soft comforts, I am slammed face first into the frigid brick walls. I feel nothing. 

So I try something more; perhaps a favorite food, the embrace of my husband, playtime with my children, a warm conversation with a close friend over a nice drink. Nothing. I might as well be staring into space. I try to pray, and nothing. No matter what I am doing, it’s all the same, and somehow despair has snuck into this room with me though I can’t see any openings whereby it could have entered. Suddenly I see that I mistook these bricks, and they are actually great cubes of ice, frozen solid, walling me in. And is it smaller than it was before? I could have sworn it was a room but this cold dark hole is no bigger than a closet and - my God it’s hard to breathe. I’m flailing to escape now: more and stronger drinks, frequent and self-interested sex, obscene amounts of food and sleep and nothing even begins to break through, not even the hint of a crack. I am stuck in this tomb no matter what I do: starving, dehydrated, hypoxic, alone, staring into a brick wall, freezing to death. How many years has it been? Only an hour; how?

Of course escape isn’t possible. There is nowhere to escape to, I see that now. The warm home of a brain I thought I had before was the fantasy and this, now, is the only thing that’s real. Sure, sometimes I think I get away, but whatever force keeps me here always tracks me down and drags me back, roaring with vengeance, upping its cruel security to ensure I will never be able to leave again. Of course I could never escape.

Except, there is one way. An exit often pondered but never taken. No, I can’t leave that way - I know that. But what a relief it is to consider. Yes, such a relief. I can’t imagine anything more peaceful than to finally get out of here, stop tearing at the walls, and just fade away. I know it’s wrong, but I cannot stop myself thinking about it. Imagining the end of it all is the only thing that brings me any remote pleasure, so I do little else. And that is what life becomes, after enough time in the room: I am either asleep, or I am thinking about my death. 

Sometimes it seems inevitable that I’ll do it eventually. I’ve put so much time and thought into it, considered it from every angle, and while I’ve never taken a single real step in that direction I know exactly the course I would take to maximize lethality and minimize conscious suffering. Yes, I’ve thought about it quite a lot, so the willpower it takes to stay in this frozen little brain is immense. But, I have to stay. I will stay.

I have a lot to do today to prepare for our friends visit tomorrow. It will be so good to see them. I know bf is excited. He bought their favorite chips and candies for their visit. Such a thoughtful guy. I thought about color schemes for granny squares before I drifted off. I would really like to not clean today but I will regret it if I don’t. If I pick up crochet now, I will be so cranky when I have to stop so it is probably best to hold off on that until mister wakes up and I can clean. 
This is just quiet time I guess. 
I made an iced coffee and grabbed a pot cookie. I only had a few nibbles; cleaning when I am rocked is not…. Actually possible. Hahah. 
I’ve been thinking a lot about this whole thing with trumpers. It has been heartbreaking to see how many there actually are. My close friends have a zero tolerance policy for trumpers but I am deeply conflicted because they will never have motivation to change if we are unkind and hateful towards them. If we pride ourselves on being a party of compassion, wouldn’t we act as such? But then I think about the way Trump describes the things he will do to the people when he comes into office and all I can think is “this guy is a nazi; these people want the holocaust”. There should be no tolerance for this. It should be shamed. It should be deeply humiliating to hold such beliefs and treat others with such cruelty. I believe that no one will ever change from the words that they hear from my mouth if my words are not demonstrated with action as well. Love is a verb. Love is actionable. Love is for everyone, even people that I don’t understand. Respect is for everyone. I think. I used to think that. But what do I do about these trumpers? How can I be kind to those who want to hurt people that I love? I hate what Trump has done to our country. But he’s just the poster child for it. It existed before him. I think of Trump as a foolish cuck; it’s less him that I am afraid of and moreso the movement that is working behind him. He’s their stepping stone. 
So….. how do I be towards these people? I’ve found myself in several uncomfortable situations where I could not safely share my opinions without making big risks and so I shut my mouth. I will not support the MAGA Narrative that we are hateful and unhinged. It’s just not true in my case or the cases of the people I surround myself with. 
Sometimes I feel like both sides are the same and it makes me feel very lost. When I got “dollar store tik tok famous” I was very sad when people went up in arms about my stances on domestic violence. The world just can’t hear it yet. I am deeply disappointed in the state of our nation. I am deeply disappointed in the people who raised me to be kind and to think of others first and to demonstrate christlike behaviors. I am deeply disappointed in the people on my side who cannot see the other side as victims too. (Victims of poverty, victims of education, victims of society, victims of fucking Trump..). Isn’t our whole thing that we got through some victim shit and now we are trying to create a world where no one has to be a fuckin victim anymore? As radical and as awful as the right side is- I feel saddened by their delusion. Some of these people believe melania is Princess Diana and that Trump communicates to them with a color coded folder system. It’s unbelievable and gross as fuck. 
I just don’t know how to behave from here on out and it’s out of alignment for my values to be cruel intentionally. I think I need to stand my ground here. I will not tolerate racism or misogyny around me, but I won’t attack people. I’ve been asking a lot more questions and adopting an attitude of curiosity towards people that I don’t understand and that seems to help a lot but like, sometimes I’m afraid they think that they are influencing me while secretly, I think they might be insane. I can’t follow a lot of the logic that supports the right side’s stances. I suppose it does not matter what they think. I am sovereign over myself. I do not approve of racism or misogyny or any of that other shit that they are about. 
Unfortunately I think that what I do from here on out matters a great deal, no matter what the end results of the election are. Those people are not going anywhere no matter who wins. Sigh. I need to find a greater resource to tap into because this shit is bigger than me. But like I said, everything I/we do matters from now on.

1gi1vdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1gi1vdq/i_was_hired_to_babysit_the_four_horsemen_of_the/,I was hired to babysit the four horsemen of the apocalypse,"I had been thinking about picking up a part-time job for a while now. The semester was over and I got a bunch of free time on my hands. Might as well make a bit of cash in the meantime. And so my search on Linkedin began. I was looking for something simple and stress-free. Preferably something I could do with minimal effort whilst staring at my phone to pass the time. I spent hours browsing through the sea of options. The majority of what I found were graphic design commissions, tutoring, and waiting tables, which I either lacked the skills for or just found unappealing. Just when I was about to give up, I stumbled onto a post, requesting for a babysitter. The post was vague, only including an address and a phone number. Typically, I would have just scrolled past this post and not given it a second thought. But I immediately noticed that the address was conveniently close to where I live. I decided to at least find out more. The call was answered before the first ring could finish.

“For the last time, I don’t want to answer your stupid surveys!”

I could hear in the background a chaotic symphony of the TV, the sound of a vacuum, and a child crying. 

“Um…I’m calling about the babysitting job?”

I feared for what I might be getting myself into. I had no prior experience taking care of children and it sounded like I was throwing myself into the deep end of the pool with this one.

“Oh? OH! Yes, the babysitting job. Yes, thank god. It’s been a nightmare trying to find one. Look. I’m running late and I’ve got about a hundred errands I need to get to. If you can get here in half an hour and look after my kids for three to four hours, five max, I’ll pay you whatever you want.”

A part of me felt bad for how desperate this man sounded. The other part of me was worried about the shitstorm I might have to weather for the next five hours. The other other part of me kept replaying the words “I’ll pay you whatever you want” in my head. 

“I’ll see you in twenty minutes.”

Fifteen minutes later I found myself in front of apartment 4H. The entire complex seemed old. Likely built in the '80s. Yet the red wallpaper, mahogany accents, and soft carpeting gave it the feel of a luxurious hotel. I could hear the same chaotic storm I had previously heard on the phone brewing inside. I felt hesitant but I already came all this way. I raised my hand up to knock, only for the door to fly open as I did.

“Oh. Hello. You're the babysitter, right?”

The man didn’t look like how I pictured him at all. He wore a clean navy-colored suit and had a tall, muscular build. He was mostly well put together besides his deep sunken eye bags, messy curly hair, and unevenly shaved stubble. Despite it all, he was actually quite handsome.

“Yep. That's me,” I confirmed.

“You’re a fast one. Caught me by surprise,” he chuckled. “Please, come in.”

I walked into the small apartment and followed him into the living room. There, I witnessed two small boys, who both looked to be about seven or eight, fighting over a small green figure of a toy soldier. The entire living room was littered with hundreds of these soldiers and tanks scattered haphazardly across the carpeted floor. I almost didn’t notice the little girl in a black dress on the couch. She sat motionless staring at the TV. MasterChef was playing. Junior.

“Hey guys. Settle down please,” the man ordered sternly.

The three children stopped their antics and simultaneously jerked their heads around to stare at me.

“Daddy is gonna be gone for a little while, alright? This nice lady here is…”

“Emily.”

“Emily is gonna look after you guys. While I'm gone she’s in charge. So be on your best behavior. I don’t want a repeat of last time.”

The children collectively gave a silent enthusiastic nod.

“Good.”

The man then turned to me.

“Emily, meet con…” the man caught himself mid-sentence.

“Silly me. I meant to say, meet Zelos, the one in the white shirt, and Martius, the one in red. They’re twins. And Limos, the girl.”

Strange names I thought. The three children waved their little hands at me as their names were called. I awkwardly waved back.

“Perfect. Bathroom is the door on the left,” he said as he gestured towards the connecting hallway with four doors. One on the left, two on the right, and one at the end of the hall. “And you can help yourself to anything in the fridge. Make yourself at home. Just…don’t go into the room at the end of the hall. That’s off limits.”

“Yeah, no problem,” I assured him.

“You might hear something inside and—""

A buzzing noise interrupted him as he frantically fished around his pocket, pulling out a phone.

“Shi-oot. I really need to get going.”

He took his wallet out and without taking his eyes off of his phone, handed me a thick wad of cash.

“Here. Order some takeout with this if they get peckish.”

Before I could think of asking questions the man disappeared out the door. I could respect an exhausted single father trying to make it through the day but he seemed awfully irresponsible leaving me, a stranger, with his kids.

I turned back to see the three children, staring at me with blank expressions.

“Looks like I’m outnumbered, guys,” I joked, trying to break the ice.

They remained silent. The girl, Limos, lost quickly interest and turned her attention back to the TV. The boys craned their necks upwards, studying me. Somehow, I felt as if they were looking down on me.

“So… how’s the battle going fellas?” I asked, attempting again to rid the awkward tension.

“Would you like to play?” Martius asked.

“NO!” Zelos began to protest.

“Father said she was in charge.”

Zelos glared at Martius, furious for even suggesting the idea that someone join their campaign. I thought it best that I remained neutral. After all, I was trying to take the next few hours as easy as possible.

“No it's alright. Thanks though. You guys carry on.”

I stood straight, furrowed my brows, and gave them a salute, doing my best impression of a soldier.

“Very well,” said Martius, as he saluted back.

I joined Limos on the couch, who upon a closer look, appeared thin and skinny. It was to the point where I was genuinely concerned that she had some kind of illness. Perhaps anorexia.

The small girl piped up with a soft quiet voice. “Can we eat? I’m hungry.”

“Of course we can sweetheart,” I told her, trying my best to show how concerned I was for her. Pizza ought to do some good.

We waited for the delivery to arrive. During that time the boys played on their battlefield and Limos lazed on the couch next to me. Her only presence being that of sharp breaths.

I found it rather cute that the boys weren’t smashing the tanks together and throwing toy soldiers at each other like I expected children their age would do. They looked as if they were competent generals of the great apartment war, and had to send their loyal men to die on no-man’s carpet. They paced around the battlefield, stroking their chin, careful not to step on any of the small soldiers.

I looked over at the little girl sitting next to me. She stared wide-eyed at the TV, mesmerized by the food.

Although pizza would be arriving soon, I thought I might as well rummage around in the fridge and cupboard for some snacks. I got up from the couch which alerted Zelos.

“Where do you think you're going?” he questioned.

“Just gonna see if you guys have any snacks.”

“They’re not for you, stranger. You think you can just come here and take what you want?”

I’ll be the first to admit that I didn’t conduct myself with the maturity of my age. But something about this disrespectful little brat got on my nerves.

“I recall your dad saying I was in charge and to ‘help myself’ to whatever I please,” I mocked, putting on a posh accent, mimicking that of royalty.

“Bitch.”

I was appalled to hear such a young boy be so vulgar and rude. I wanted to discipline him. I wanted to let him know that he was to respect me. That he should listen to what I say and learn to quickly apologize. In hindsight, this didn’t feel like me at all. I came here to make a quick buck. Why did I care so much about enduring insults from children? At that moment, I very much did care.

I straightened my posture to look as imposing as possible and stomped my foot down as hard as I could, just to try and make him flinch. As I did, I felt a sharp sting of pain shoot up my leg. I fell back onto the couch and lifted my foot onto my knees to inspect what had caused the pain. It was a toy soldier’s bayonet. The soldier’s arm was half torn off, only attached to the torso by a thin strip of green plastic. I slowly pulled the sharp plastic piece out of my foot, leaving a small stain of blood on my socks.

“Shit,” I blurted aloud.

I looked up to see Zelos and Martius staring at me. Zelos, as expected, looked livid that I had broken his toy. Martius on the other hand, looked at the broken soldier that now laid on the carpet. The tip of its bayonet now covered in a dark tint of red. He had a mournful look on his face.

“Guys…I’m so sorry,” I apologized, the anger I had felt quickly fading away. “I’ll buy you a new one I promise.”

“THAT WASN’T HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO!” Zelos exploded.

“Zelos please. I’ll replace it for you the next time I come over, okay?”

“He can’t be replaced,” said Martius, as he got on his knees and gingerly picked up the soldier.

He brought it to a small jar that rested on the coffee table. The jar was half filled with green plastic soldier parts. A loose collection of hands, feets, heads, and torsos. Martius carefully sets the soldier he held onto the top of the pile.

“You guys really shouldn’t just leave these toys on the floor like this.”

Martius shot a furious glare at me in response to that comment.

“I DON’T CARE IF YOU’RE IN CHARGE! IT’S NOT FAIR!”

Then I did something I regretted. I giggled. I found it amusing how they were so immersed in this game of theirs. I tried to stop myself, especially when I saw how the twins were fuming.

“I’m…I’m really sorry guys. I’ll make it up to you I promise.”

“You don’t understand. This is not a mistake easily amendable. But perhaps…” Martius stopped, turning to Zelos.

The two of them seemed to have a silent conversation between themselves. Zelos, with tears welling up in his eyes, gave Martius a solemn nod.

Zelos, reaching into his pockets, took out another toy soldier. He handed it to Martius, who in turn, presented it to me. This one was different. It was a bit shorter and had a smaller build. It was a woman, in the same soldier uniform and equipped with identical gear as the rest. This was my first close look at these toys and I was impressed with how detailed they were. Down to the intricate facial features.

I was puzzled by the realization. I was sure I was just overthinking it but the small green face that stared back at me, was mine.

Before I could examine it further, Martius quickly snatched the toy from my grasp. He marched back to the center of the carpet battlefield, with my soldier in hand.

“Perhaps we can make you understand,” said Martius, as he places the soldier down on the carpet.

“Wait. Give that…” I started to say.

I never got to finish my sentence. I still don’t know which of the assaults on my senses alerted me first. Was it the awful smell of sulfuric odor, the metallic scent of blood, and the acrid tang of gunpowder? Was it the thick gritty taste of ash and smoke that lingered in the air? Was it the chorus of unintelligible screams, and the staccato of machine-gun fire that flew overhead? Regardless, what caught my attention the most, was the soldier in front me. He sat slumped into the mud and filth of the trench we were in. I knew he was dead by just the look on his face. His eyes, barely open, lazily staring at me. His jaws hung slack with a river of blood trickling from the edge of his lips. As for the rest of his body, it had been contorted to a mangled mass of flesh. His arms, attached to the torso by only a strip of sinew. His hands still held on tightly to his weapon. A rifle with a fixed bayonet.

Just a moment ago I had been sitting on a couch in a living room in a small apartment downtown. I blinked and everything changed so abruptly, I couldn’t even begin to comprehend what had happened to me.

The mud I sat on was softened by either rainwater or blood. It was cold and the moisture seeped into the uniform I now wore. Somehow sinking deeper into the ground gave me the slightest notion of comfort. Perhaps no one would notice me, I thought. I could pass for another corpse amongst the hundreds. And so I stayed quiet, holding myself back from screaming or crying. I tried remaining still but I couldn’t stop my heart from furiously beating or my teeth from chattering. I plugged my ears with my filthy fingers, covered in dirt and soot, desperately attempting to shield myself from the horrible blood-curdling screeches that could barely be said to have come from a human. I breathed small gasps of ashy air to avoid having to smell the rot. I took one last look at the dead soldier before shutting my eyes. I would’ve kept them shut too if I didn’t catch a flicker of movement.

He blinked.

My eyes shot wide open, staring intently into the soldier’s soulless eyes. His eyelids began to flutter. His fingers twitched. His ankles shifted ever so slightly. Then without warning, his upper body heaved forward, lunging towards me. Its lower body didn’t follow and his spine immediately disconnected with a sickening crack. He landed at my feet, face-planting in the mud, and returned to being inanimate. I almost let out a yelp but it got caught in my dry throat. I thought that maybe some explosive shockwave had simply knocked him over.

Suddenly, his arm, attached only by a chipped bone and strips of exposed muscles flung upwards, grabbing me by my leg. I screamed but only a raspy gasp resonated as my vocal cords strained and burned. I kicked at the corpse but it refused to release its grasp. With surprising force and speed, it yanked itself towards me so that its torso landed on my knees. I felt the soft tissues of its dismembered half resting on me. Its body slumped onto mine and its face pressed right against my ears as I turned away, refusing to look at the monster. Surely I was in hell.

Then, softly, a whisper resonated deeply over the deafening sounds of the battle. The soldier croaked into my ears with a plea.

“I – I beg of you. Release…the pale rider.”

A bell rang in the distance. Like a wave, the sound washed over me and in an instant, everything fell away. The cries, the rot, the filth, and the corpse. All gone. The familiar sound of the TV and the fresh breathable air reassured me that I was back in the apartment, sitting on the floor, leaning against the couch. It was such a surreal and abrupt shift of scenery I could’ve almost convinced myself it had all been in my head. That was until I saw Martius stood where he had been previously, holding a small green soldier in his hand. He looked at me, no longer with the look of anger, but of pity. I flinched as he began making his way towards me, careful of where he stepped. He crouched down next to me, took my hand, and placed the figure onto my palm. I didn’t need to look to know that it was my figure he had given me.

“Take better care of this one,” he said to me as if I was a child in his eyes.

The familiar note of the bell that had pulled me back to the apartment rang once again. It took me a moment to gather my thoughts and realize that it was the doorbell I had been hearing. Someone was at the door.

“Pizza time!” Limos shouted excitedly.

Slowly, I pushed myself off the floor, found my balance, then began making my way towards the door. I’m sure many of you, in my shoes, would’ve taken this opportunity to escape. Likewise, I had made the decision that I was going to run fast and far the moment I opened the door, leaving this accursed apartment of demonic children. No amount of money could be worth what I had just experienced. I found myself in a small sprint as I neared the door. My hand shot out towards the handle and I forcefully yanked the door open, pulling myself into the hallway.

I was greeted by the fragrance of pizza and nothing. Utter darkness. The hallway I had entered from earlier, now void of any light besides the faint glow coming from the apartment. All that seemed to exist within the hallway was me and the box of pizza on the floor. Domino’s.

I stood there, contemplating on what to do. Perhaps the electricity had just simply gone out. That was fine, because I recalled where the stairwell was located. I could still escape.

“Are you going to share?”

Limos’s voice from behind startled me. I leapt away from her and the apartment, deeper into the hall. She was standing at the threshold of the apartment. Between the two of us, the pizza box sat patiently.

“Please,” she pleaded. “I’m so hungry.”

The look on her face read of desperation. The black dress she wore appeared to hang loosely on her body. I was sure it fitted her earlier but now it seemed a few sizes too big.

“Please,” she begged again. “The pale one is close.”

There it was again. The mention of this pale thing. Upon hearing this ominous omen, I turned around and blindly sprinted in the opposite direction down the hall where I remembered the stairs to be. It had to be there. My foot stamped and beat against the floor as I bolted in a straight line. In the pitch black, it was impossible to see how close I was. I fully expected to eventually run into a wall. No obstacle ever came.

“It’s not something you can outrun,” Limos spoke again, the volume of her voice noticeably hadn’t faltered with the distance I had traveled.

I stopped in my tracks. I turned to face her thinking she had followed me. She hadn’t. She still remained at the threshold of the apartment doorway. The pizza box still laid on the floor between us. And I stood where I had been at the start. A mere few feet out the apartment.

“It’s not the fastest, but it’ll catch you,” she spoke as I struggled to catch my breath. “It always does.”

“What is this?” I asked her, demanding the child for an answer.

I was at a loss. Everything certain that I built my understanding of the world on had crumbled away. What was left was anger and fear. Like a small mouse cornered and out of options.

“It’s pizza.”

“WHAT IS THIS PLACE!” I yelled back, finally losing my temper. I never thought myself capable of hurting a child but at that moment, I was prepared to do so.

“Domino.”

“ENOUGH!” I screamed as I lunged at her, attempting to do something horrible.

I reached out to grab her by the collar of her dress. She didn’t step backwards or attempt to dodge, yet somehow she shifted ever so slightly out of my reach. I fell flat on my face onto the cold solid floor, now noticing that I wasn’t even sure what I had been standing on. I felt pain, followed by blood trickling out of my nose. It most certainly wasn’t the soft carpeted floor I recalled when first arriving at this apartment complex.

As I laid prone on the floor, I stared up at the frail girl who now stood above me with an imposing presence. Behind her, the light of the apartment in stark contrast to the darkness made her figure a dark silhouette. I felt defeated. I didn’t even try to stand back up. I may not have been sure where I was but the ground felt solid and tangible. It was something I could be certain of and that brought me comfort.

“What is this?” I asked again, this time my question came out quivering.

Limos crouched down, inspecting me as if I was a small insect she found crawling across the floor.

“The path,” she answered.

“What does that mean?”

“Are you hungry?” she asked me, ignoring my question.

Her concern sounded genuine. I wanted to tell her I wasn’t since food was the least of my worries, but as soon as she asked, it was as if she reminded my body of the idea of hunger. I felt starved. I felt hunger like I had never felt before. My stomach curled and cramped within me, screaming for sustenance. The aroma of the pizza now overpowering all my senses. I could almost taste the fragrance in the air itself.

“Y-Yes.”

“Are you strong?” she asked again.

“Y-” I hesitated to answer. How could I be strong in the state I was in?

“Do you want to live?”

“Yes. Yes please. Please let me live,” I begged her. “Please help me.”

“I want to live too,” she said as she began stepping towards the pizza box.

She gently lifted the cardboard box open and the smell of the bubbling cheese, tomato sauce, and pepperoni had me salivating. I immediately mustered up my last bit of strength and brought myself to my hands and knees. I crawled in the direction of the beckoning food, yet quickly realized I was making no progress. As if I was on a hamster wheel, I simply could not move any closer. I started to crawl faster, with more desperation, and before long, I had gotten onto my feet. I stumbled toward the little girl, who was now hunched over the pizza box on the floor with her back facing me. My stumbling sped up until I jogged, then ran, then to a full-on sprint. No matter how fast or slow I went, I made no progress. They were right there in front of me. I was so close yet so infinitely far. All I could do was move in place, watching Limos scarf down each slice before me. As she gleefully ate, my only thought was the dwindling food left for me when I eventually reached the pizza box. She was going to eat it all for herself and leave me with nothing. I couldn’t let that happen. One after another, the slices of pizza disappeared down her gluttonous gullet. I remember begging her to help me. To toss me just a bit. To save some for me. She never bothered to turn around. I yelled and screamed but eventually, I grew too tired to do so.

Finally, it came down to the final slice. She reached for it like she did the others. As I felt the last bit of my strength drain, in desperation, I tried leaping towards her one last time. I fully assumed that I would just land on my face as I did before, no closer to salvation. Yet I held out hope. I think that was what did it. Desperate, violent hope. One last act of defiance against the inevitable death. This time, I felt myself propel forward and for the first time, Limos rapidly approached me. I slammed into the small frail child, landing on top of her with incredible force. She yelped in surprise and pain as I felt her brittle right arm snap under the weight of my knee. In that moment, not only did I dismiss the injury I caused her, I felt retribution as it was revenge for watching me suffer. I quickly turned my attention to the box of pizza which to my horror, was now empty.

Furious, I turned back to Limos, who I now see in her right hand, despite the pain of her fractured arm, still held onto the last slice. Without hesitation, I ripped it out of her hand and forcefully shoved it down my throat. I expected it to taste like the most savory, delicious bite and yet, as my taste buds familiarized itself with the gooey slop, I was met with the disgusting taste of rot. Involuntarily, I threw up what little was left in my stomach. Black viscous liquid poured out of my mouth along with the half-chewed pizza. It appeared molded and putrid, as if it had been neglected for months. Dark moldy spots of purple and green hue festered on the crust. Small specks of pale maggots writhed in the spoiled cheese and toppings. I spat onto the floor, attempting to wash the terrible taste that lingered.

“NO!” Limos shrieked in horror as I keeled over the pile of vomit in excruciating pain.

With my knee still holding her down by her broken arm, she began to struggle with a surprising spur of strength. I watched as she forcefully tugged on her fractured arm, steam exuding from her elbow. Gradually, her arm stretched and strained as she pulled. I was too weak and terrified to stop her. With a wail of pain and triumph, she slid the bone of her forearm out of her arm as if it were a sleeve made of muscle and skin. The motion was so smooth it was like pulling the bone out of a tenderized rib.

Upon freeing herself, she pushed me aside and with her one arm, scooped the black vile mass into her mouth. The sound of animalistic slurping and feral grunts was all I heard. No traces of humanity were left. As she devoured the filth with reckless abandon my attention turned to the steaming flesh that she left behind. I feared a part of me knew that I was not far from descending to her level of madness.

It reminded me of the burning smell of human flesh from the trenches. I reached out to it. Piping hot to the touch. I grabbed onto the wrist and with a revolting squish, the skin and muscle fiber fell apart like pulled pork.

Just then, a shadow casted over me. A figure loomed before me, covering the light of the apartment.

“Pathetic,” Zelos taunted with a disgusted look of pity on his face.

I could only imagine what he saw of me. Then he slammed the door shut leaving me shrouded in true darkness.

I wasn’t sure how long I was there for. The awful sound of Limos’s savagery quickly died down as she finished what was left of my excretion. After that, it was hard to tell how much time had passed. I stayed grovelling on the ground, my hand still held on the warm moist lump of the girl’s discarded flesh. My hunger grew ever stronger but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. To stoop so low. To even think of consuming my own. It was abominable. I thought it better to be starved to death. To finally be free of this nightmare. I don’t expect anyone to understand or condone my actions, but know that I was pushed to the brink of my sanity. A deep primal urge within me wanted so desperately to live. To survive at any cost. So reluctantly, I held the mass of flesh and slowly brought it to my mouth, thankful that at the very least I could not see what I had to do. As I choked on the gamey meat through sobs, I heard a shuffling sound approach me. I couldn’t see her but I knew Limos was standing right next to me while I chewed on her member.

“You are strong,” she whispered.

Within the void, a blinding light washed over us. I squinted my eyes and in an instant, just as seamless as it had been in the trench, I found myself back in the apartment. Except this time it was quiet and empty. The TV had been turned off and the floor was cleared of the toys. The insatiable hunger I had felt mere moments ago faded away. The only thing left of the horrors in the abyss was the vile aftertaste that continued to linger. It quickly came to my realization that I appeared to be alone in the apartment. I got up and did a quick scan of the living room and the kitchen to confirm it. I was alone. Perhaps they had retreated back into their rooms. I looked down the hall to the bedrooms, which now appeared more threatening and ominous. As if some new terror lurks behind each door.

Once again, I found myself with an opportunity to escape. This time however, I feared using the front door and ending up back in that terrible purgatory. The next method of exit would be out the window. I could still hear the sound of bustling pedestrians and traffic outside. It calmed me knowing that I was still somewhat connected with the outside world. I was four stories up with no safe way of getting down, but at that point I was content with simply risking the fall. To my disappointment, the window refused to budge when I tried lifting it open. It was an old wooden framed window with no locks on it. Through some supernatural means, it was simply immovable. On the verge of a breakdown, I grabbed the nearest solid object to me which was a desk lamp and proceeded to smash it into the glass as hard as I could. I couldn’t even leave a scratch. Feeling at a loss, I reluctantly tried the door once again. Slowly and carefully, I opened the door, making sure that I kept myself within the confines of the apartment.

To my relief, I was no longer greeted by the abyss. The hallway had returned to its original state. Hesitantly, I stepped out into the hallway. As I crossed the threshold out the apartment, a faint cry emanated from behind me. It was the sound of an infant bawling. I flinched as the crying broke the eerie silence. It's odd that the sound of a helpless baby crying could invoke such fear within me but nevertheless I sprinted out of the apartment and ran for the stairwell. My heart pumped furiously as I sprinted as fast as I could away from the danger, taking two or three steps at a time. As I reached the ground level, I bursted out the stairwell door into the lobby. I found myself standing at the threshold of apartment 4H. The baby’s crying now intensified. I turned back expecting the stairwell I had just exited to still be behind me. The same hallway on the fourth floor greeted me. After being led on with the hopes of escape only to be denied it once again, I fell onto my knees and wept. For the next few hours I cried along with the infant.

In the lasting moments I stayed idle, the sunlight from the window never seemed to dim. The father, the man who lured me into this abstract non-euclidian prison, has yet to return, and I doubted he ever will. Eventually, my crying ceased as my eyes ran dry. The infant however, continued its tantrum alone. Its lungs never tired or faltered. Hours, perhaps even days go by. In the time I’ve attempted multiple times to escape. My phone had no signal or connection and any attempt to reach the outside world failed. I tried the stairwell again only to find myself back in the apartment every time. I went knocking on the neighboring apartment doors only to be met with silence. When I tried forcing my way in, to my surprise, none of the doors were locked. Only it seemed every apartment was apartment 4H. The elevator, no matter what floor I chose, always opened to apartment 4H.

I never grew hungry or thirsty. I never tired or slept. I just existed in this static space where the sun never waned, the scenery unchanged, and the crying endless. I felt the essence of my soul dim. I had fought with all I had and committed heinous atrocities for the right to live. Now as I sat on the kitchen floor, feeling the sharp cool edge of a kitchen knife brush gently against my neck, I wondered why I had fought so hard. It’s okay to give up now, right? I’ve tried everything. I’m at the end of the road. With my eyes shut, my grip on the blade’s handle tightened as I slowly pressed the sharp edge firmly against my throat. I applied pressure slowly, still fearing the last stretch of pain before I could finally rest.

“I’m scared,” a child’s voice piped up.

I froze, unable to even breathe. I hesitated to open my eyes. I could hear the child sniffling and whimpering in front of me. I had gotten so used to it, the sudden absence of the baby’s cries unnerved me.

“Can you stay with me?” they asked, in a high-pitched shrill voice. It was the voice of a little girl but it didn’t sound like Limos.

I still held the blade closely to my neck with my eyes shut tightly. It felt reassuring that I could end the torment anytime I wanted to. To finally hold my own life in my hand. It gave me a sense of courage. My eyelids loosened and my vision fluttered open. Expecting to see a small child, instead towering over me was an old woman. She was impossibly tall, to the point she had to hunch over to avoid the ceiling. She stood naked, covered only by her long unkempt gray hair. Her ashened skin, although saggy and wrinkled, were clean and eerily pale. It was like the first hint of snowfall on a solstice, where soft curved patches of snow layered atop another. I didn’t notice a hint of blemish or imperfection. Her face however was that of a child. Up to her neck her skin becomes smooth like porcelain. Youth was distilled on only her facial features. Buttoned nose, wide eyes, small pink lips, and rounded cheeks. She looked at me with tears welling up in her puppy eyes.

“Can you read to me?” she asked, in the same childish voice. It was uncanny to see the thing speak.

I remained silent, unsure of how to respond. She raised her bony hand and reached her thin fingers towards me.

“Don’t,” I hissed, turning the knife onto her.

She quickly retracted her hand and backed away, retreating to the far end of the kitchen. For a moment I felt relieved to see this creature feared me as much I feared it. The moment was short-lived as her brow tightened, her cheeks flushed and her mouth tensed. She looked like she was about to burst.

“Why? Why do you still resist? Why can’t you just stay with me? It won’t hurt. It won’t ever hurt again.”

“What are you?” I demanded.

She looked at me curiously. Her face softened, as if comprehending my question.

“I’m the last one,” she answered. “I’m what's left when everyone is gone.”

Her expression shifted back to sadness, and I watched as a single streak of tear ran down her cheek.

“It’s lonely,” she sniveled.

“I can’t stay.”

Through her watery eyes, she cracked a warm smile.

“You will. You always do.”

The way she said it didn’t sound like a threat.

“Is there a way to leave?” I asked, my eyes darting towards the open door to the hallway.

Her eyes followed mine out the door, then she looked back at me, shaking her head.

“What can I do then?”

“You can rest,” she said. “Finally.”

The sweetness in her tone made the idea sound rather comfortable.

“Or…” she hesitated. “Or you can put me to rest.”

“What happens if I do that?” I questioned, intrigued by an alternative choice.

“Then I’ll see you again, down the road.”

“So I can leave?”

“For now. You’ll be back soon enough.”

She reached towards me, handing me a card I hadn’t previously noticed. Cautiously, I held it by the corner and took it. It was a polaroid. The image is blurry and yellowed by time. The photograph depicted an extreme wide shot of a beautiful meadow. In the distance, four horses frolicked in the tall grass.

I looked back at her, wondering what she was trying to tell me. With a grin on her face she excitedly twirls her finger around, signaling for me to turn the photo. I flipped it over and saw that written on the back in beautiful cursive handwriting, was a poem.

“Read to me,” she said, as she made her way onto the couch in the living room.

She sat down, curling herself into the corner. She patted the cushion next to her, beckoning for me to join. I set the knife down on the kitchen counter and complied.

With a gentle tone, as if singing a lullaby, I began to read the poem aloud.

“Dawn heralded the coming of their steeds,

Each rider, a calamity of man’s sinful deeds.”

I glanced at her, to see her nodding in approval.

“Keep going.”

I continued onto the next line.

“First came conquest, who bolstered the pride of man,

The white messenger's taunt is where it all began.

Then war swiftly followed, with fiery hate in his heart,

The red knight's blade spilled blood, torn flesh apart.

Next crept famine, that consumed the very last bite,

The black witch's spell shrouded the world with blight.”

My voice cracks, as I was reminded of the corpse and the abyss. My mouth felt dry and a chill ran down my spine. I pressed on.

“Finally arrived death, as they all wept and grieved,

The pale lady's touch gently granted them reprieve.”

My speech faltered as the realization dawned on me.

“The pale rider,” I muttered under my breath. I turned to see her eyes closed and her expression softened. She breathed steadily, her chest heaving with each inhale.

Even though she was asleep, I proceeded to read the final line of the poem to myself.

“One after another the domino falls,

Until dusk whisks the horsemen back to their stalls.”

As I finished, I felt a tear fall across my face. A tremendous wave of relief washed over me. As if a heavy burden had finally been lifted. Like for the first time in my life, I could truly breathe.

“Thank you,” I told her as she slept. “But not today. I can endure it for a bit longer.”

Then I watch the folds and sags of her skin tighten. Her body shrunk before me. Her hair retracted back into their follicles. Until laying beside me, was an infant. I carefully picked her up and carried her down the hall to the final room at the end. As I did, I walked past the three other rooms, the doors to which now hung open. In the first door on the right, I saw Zelos and Martius, sleeping in a bunk bed. I peeked inside, shut the lights off and closed the door as quietly as I could.

I continued down the hall and in the second door on the right, I saw Limos shivering in a fetal position on her bed. I walked over and pulled a blanket over her. Instantly her body relaxed and her breathing calmed. Again, I turned the lights off and closed the door behind me.

Onto the final room at the end of hall. Carefully balancing the infant in one arm, I turned the doorknob and stepped through. This room was by far the largest and most empty. Only three things took up any space. A crib in the center of the room, a small cot tucked away in the corner, and a wooden rocking horse painted white.

On the horse, carved the phrase: *Móros, who stole our pain* 

I carefully set the child down in her crib and watched her nestle comfortably. Her breathing was gentle and rhythmic, with each exhale a delicate sigh escaped. She looked so fragile and serene, as if held in a moment untouched by time. The soft rays of the afternoon sun filtered through the curtains, casting a warm glow across her smooth, pale skin.

“She’s beautiful, isn’t she?”

The voice of a man came from behind me. It felt like a lifetime ago but it was still familiar.

“She is,” I replied, not taking my eyes off the child.

The man joined me at my side and the two of us shared a quiet moment adoring the child.

“This is as close as I can be to her,” he said, somberly. “And yet you choose to continue suffering?”

“It’s not always suffering. There are moments like these that make the pain worth it.”

“Perhaps. But you live as long as I have, experience the highest of highs and the lowest of low…I tire of this infinite stasis. I yearn for the day I shut my eyes for the last time.”

He spoke with no emotion. As heart wrenching as his words were, it was as if he’s said them before countless times. There was only one question on my mind. After encountering conquest, war, famine, and now death, I wondered just who this man who claimed to be their father was.

“I know you’re thinking what kind of man I am to deserve this fate,” he said, as if reading my thoughts. “It’s not a divine punishment to care for them. It’s a father’s duty after all. They are born of my sin. I may have fathered humanity’s ruin but to see my fellow man struggle and fight, refusing to let their next breath be their last…I am in awe of your resilience.”

I should have felt hatred towards the man. I should have held him responsible for the horrors I endured. Yet, without another word shared between us, I stepped away from the crib, and took my leave. I shut the door as I left, the last thing I saw being the man standing over his child, his fists clenched so tightly that beads of blood trickled down the creases of his hands. 

I walked out the apartment, descended down the stairwell, entered into the lobby and finally, I stepped out of the building onto the bustling sidewalk. If not for the polaroid tucked away in my pocket, I might have tried to convince myself that it was all a fever dream for the sake of my sanity. I took the photo out just to confirm it. 

I studied it for a moment, confused that the picture had now changed. In place of the four horses that ran across the horizon now stood four children. Two boys and two girls. They watched as before them, a lone man stood atop a corpse with a caved in skull, a bloodied stone in his hand. I flipped the polaroid over and as I had predicted, the poem had also been replaced.

Hi! I’m doing my Masters + PhD in London :) I was raised in both the US and UK over the years so my accent throws people off (I just embrace it as an international school accent). I did my undergrad in the US and then moved back home because I wanted to be closer to family and I miss rainy London. About me: I love to run, swim, hike. My hobbies include, crafting, cooking, reading, movies, and music. My preferred drink is a Matcha Latte but I also really love coffee. My studies and work keep me incredibly busy but ever so often I crave some good deep conversations with a hint (a lot) of sweetness.  I enjoy having academic conversations since I love learning new things. I’m a big fan of staying in and if I could I would probably never leave my house. I’m incredibly open to sharing pictures and eventually talking over voice call and I love questions so feel free to ask me anything:))

Looking for some honest and critical (but fair, please) feedback - this is our site: [magicmerch.co.uk](http://magicmerch.co.uk)

We sell a range of novelty items, including funny (and often, controversial) cards, mugs, christmas gifts and more.

We've tried a variety of Meta Ad Campaigns, including:

* Adv+ Sales Campaigns - carousel, catalogue, single image, single video
* Manual Sales Campaigns - carousel, catalogue, single image, single video

  
Here's a snippet of our metrics:

* Imp: 247,080
* CPM: £6.16
* Reach: 151,381
* Freq: 1.63
* CTR: 2.08
* CPC: £0.30
* ROAS: 1.01

Manual Campaigns have been a mix of targeting 'Engaged Shoppers' as well as broad targeting, as well as targeting 'Coffee Lovers', 'Christmas Gifts' and everything else you can imagine, in various combinations (product set dependent, of course).

We've tried making eye-catching content via Canva, both images and video, as well as using other external tools such as Breakout Clips - but nada!

We're not getting much success to be honest, and it feels like an endless pit of money.

At the beginning of October, we had an Adv+ Catalogue Campaign running, which generated about 50 sales over 3 days (which was amazing for us), and then stopped working. It hasn't generated anything further since?

Does anyone have any advice on what we might be doing wrong? All of the customers which we have had, have been extremely positive, and really satisfied and happy with their products. Genuinely, we haven't had a single return in more than 200 orders (which we're really proud of).

**Any and all feedback on what we can do to change our approach is appreciated! I'm a great believer in that doing what we've done before will just yield the same results, so time to swallow our pride and change approach.**

**For info and context, we've spent well over 2k on Meta Ads so far (since June).**

My brother and I each got the standard US collector coin (blue bound, trifold?)sets that would be populated by the coins our parents found, consisting of pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters. 

And their efforts went way beyond that. 

Now in their early 80’s they’re wondering what they should do with all the rolled coins that have accumulated. They include every decade starting around 1900, but mostly from late 1920-30s to the late 1970s. 

Aside from sorting by denomination and year, I don’t think there was any discrimination as to what was included in each roll as far as coin condition goes. But she would upgrade certain coins in our collectors books if a coin of better value came up for each year.

My Mom asked me the other day, whether I thought there was any value in her going back and unrolling these coins to look for anything specific, acknowledging that it would be a rather large undertaking giving the hundreds of rolls they have.

If this was your parents, what would you do, or tell them to do?

Despite username, we grew up in the United States.

Anyway! I know that consensus is that performance generally matters more than size. But when people do talk about size, it seems like they're usually asking about length. Despite that, I have also heard people say that the girth is important, too!  

So I'm just wondering if there is any agreement on this. In your opinion, which is more important in bed? Is length better than girth, or does girth matter more than length? And why?  

I think it would be interesting to learn what different people think about this! So if you want to share your opinion, feel free to message on here.

We met at a party, and hit it off really well, and the first time we hung out I let them know my age and left the ball in their court to decide whether that's something they wanted or not.

The age gap was something that I was worried about at first, and talked to a lot of friends about it, which they all said that I'm good, if I have a connection with someone I shouldn't let it stop me.

They then hit me up to hang out about a week after, and we started hanging out pretty regularly. I had to go home for a month, and we continued to talk, and have FaceTime dates while I was gone.

As I got to know them more the age gap issue faded because they were amazing, and that's all that mattered to me.

When I got back we were hanging out, and they asked if they could call me their boyfriend, and I said of course you can, and they let me know that I was their first relationship.

We became really close, we spent a lot of time together, and did a lot of things. We're both musicians in the same college, so there was constantly things going on like shows, and friends shows and such. I did my best to support them through all of their endeavors.

We used to talk about what we're doing in the future, and after graduating.

A week before they broke up with me they told me they were going to fall in love with me. I was also going to fall in love with them, if I wasn't already actively doing that.

The Saturday after that we woke up and we were having a great morning, we grabbed coffee, and met up with one of their friends and talked, and I thought it was generally a pretty good morning. Then it just all fell apart and they started crying, and saying that they can't do it. I fought for the relationship for hours, and tried to calmly talk with them about what was going on, and if they wanted to wait, and think things out before making a decision, they agreed at first, but then collapsed again a said we should call it.

I left. I calmly packed my shit and left.

We talked a week after, and they're whole reason is that they felt like a child, and they couldn't handle someone that has a quarter of life on them.
I understand that feelings are feelings, and that can be hard to navigate, but to me that feels like I was only ever my age, and I wasn't valued as me. I feel like the person should outweigh the age.

They told me I was the greatest man they have ever met, and that they really really like me, and will value everything about our relationship, but I'm so confused as to why it all fell apart then.

I know they want me in their life still as they've said as much, but it hurts me so much to know that we both still have feelings for each other, and they want to move on.

I feel horrible because all I want to do in the morning is text them, or send them memes throughout the day, but every time I think of them a piece of me feels like it's being torn out of me.

I know that I will be ok. I've been through a lot, and have had worse breakups before, but this one was just different. I felt wholly and completely accepted, yet it turns out I wasn't.

I was able to get a first class roundtrip ticket for only $330.  (cheaper than flying coach on Alaska at the time)  I was planning on bringing a carry-on since it's only for 4 nights but a friend reminded me that I get two free checked bags so why not check instead?  That led to me deciding to pack a couple of bottles of nice wine to give to my friend for her birthday.  She is not going to be able to pick me up for 2-3 hours after I land at 5:26pm.  Because I'm checking a bag, I will need to go down to baggage claim to get it.  Then I'm outside security.  I looked up bars/restaurants for Terminal 3 outside security and it's literally only Peet's Coffee.  I'd like to sit down somewhere, have a glass of wine and an appetizer while I wait for my friend.  I have no status with Delta, nor do I have an Am Ex card, only a lowly first class ticket so no lounge access for me, sadly.  FWIW, this will be my first FC experience ever! Also, my friend lives 45 min away so Ubering to her house would be VERY expensive.

I'm thinking my only options are:

1. Sit at Peet's Coffee or some other chair near baggage claim, read a book and wait for my friend.

2. Uber to a nearby hotel that has a restaurant and relax there.  Maybe they can hold my suitcase while I eat at their restaurant?

Is this a good buy or should I look at something else? Something to consider that LM just started their BF sale here in the UK with the Micra down to £2,800 and the stainless at £2300.

Does anyone out there use the gen 1 mini daily and what are your thoughts? Any issues to be aware of? Also what is your real life heat up time as I know it’s says 10-15 mins online, is this accurate?

From April to May, we had to move to the old fire station. The Tomskog Fire Department had long since been dismantled, being absorbed into St. Cloud and the surrounding area – leaving their old station available. It’d been used a handful of times as a sort of community space, but there was limited use for an old fire station. It didn’t take long to set up shop though, and with the folks from the DUC helping us out we got the resources we needed.

With Charlie on sick leave, I had to stay on radio duty for the foreseeable future. As we were running short on manpower, I was solely responsible for running the dispatch during the evening shift. We moved off the secure channels though – just in case I wasn’t around for a call or two.

I’m not gonna say those few weeks weren’t eventful, but they were eventful in a way that didn’t directly affect me. There was some sort of operation to shut down a turbine, for example, that seemed to have dire implications.

 

My days weren’t that eventful. I took calls, redirected our various units to check them out (or not), and made sure to take note of anything out of the ordinary. I also acted as a sort of info hub for the DUC, who checked with me every now and then to see if something unusual happened. A couple of people called in about spotting Patrick and his crossbow a couple of times, but he hadn’t hunted anyone since the Rosemills, so we just assured the callers and hung up.

But there was that one call that would change my time in Tomskog – permanently.

I was on my way home after an evening shift, clocking out just after 10pm. I was dragging myself to my car, sipping the last few drops of a forest-fire-tasting americano. Apparently getting a decent coffee machine wasn’t high on the DUC list of priorities. I heard a strange noise and stopped, only to realize it was my phone. My personal one. It hadn’t rung in so long that I’d forgotten my custom ring tone – Stayin’ Alive, by the Bee Gees.

I didn’t recognize the number. I figured it might be someone from work who needed me for an extra shift.

I answered.

 

“Please don’t hang up.”

That was the first thing they said to me. It sounded like a man – nervous, if anything. I stayed quiet, giving the stranger a chance to say his piece.

“You’re the new girl, aren’t you?” he continued. “At the station?”

“Who is this?”

“My name’s Adam,” he said. “I’m looking for my daughter.”

“I’m sure we can help you,” I said. “But I need you to call during office hours, and not to my private phone.”

“It’s not like that,” he sighed. “I’ve talked to the sheriff countless times, but he’s not doing anything. But I believe you can.”

“This is sketchy, Adam. Why would I be able to help when the sheriff can’t?”

“Because you’re still here to protect and serve.”

I stopped in front of my car, rolling my eyes. The taste of burnt coffee stained the roof of my mouth.

“I just need a few minutes of your time,” Adam continued. “You’ll get a free lunch.”

 

It was the first bribe I’d ever accepted. The next day, I met Adam for lunch at the one downtown café Tomskog offered. They had little blue sunflowers in every window, and they all had that strange illusion where it looked like they turned towards you no matter the angle you looked at.

Adam was in his early 50’s, with thinning blond hair and a beer belly that poked the edge of the table. He had these naturally sad facial features, like his face had slightly melted. I couldn’t imagine him smiling, other than sarcastically. He got out of his seat, shook my hand, and asked for my order. I wanted a sandwich and a latte, and he was off like a bullet.

When we sat down to eat, he scooched a little closer and lowered his voice.

“Thank you for meeting me,” he said. “I’m sorry if I startled you.”

“I’m still not sure if I can help,” I said. “But I’m sorry about your daughter.”

He pulled out a small photo. A young woman with a black pixie-like haircut and black eyeliner.

“Her name’s Elizabeth,” he said. “Or Ellie. Elle to some.”

“She’s pretty,” I smiled. “But I haven’t seen her.”

“I know, I know,” he nodded. “But I think you can help me find her.”

 

We finished our lunches. As people walked by, Adam would lower his voice and look over his shoulder. I could tell he wasn’t comfortable being out in public. I’d seen strange people in Tomskog before, and there were a lot of them, so this wasn’t out of the ordinary; but something about Adam seemed more genuine. He was weird for a *reason*.

“I don’t know how much they’ve told you,” he said. “Have Hatchet been around?”

“Hatchet?” I scoffed. “The pharma people?”

“So no. You got any inoculations? Any shots?”

“What, like, tetanus?”

“You really are new, huh?”

He attempted a grin, but it came of as a tired squint.

“Look,” he continued. “I’ll tell you everything I know. But you gotta promise to help me.”

“I can’t promise you anything,” I said. “I don’t know this girl.”

“Just promise you’ll try. Please.”

Looking across the table, there was no way I could say no. I had a soft spot for people asking nicely, and Adam seemed like an honest guy. At least genuine enough to know when to reach out of his comfort zone.

“Alright. I’ll try.”

 

I followed Adam to his car and sat down in his passenger seat. We exchanged numbers, and he took out a notebook. He had detailed notes about everything related to his daughter, along with names, dates, witness testimonies, and a handful of other details. I got a brief look at his glove compartment when he got his reading glasses. There were a handful of other notebooks in there as well.

Elizabeth had survived a fall from a great height. She’d broken her legs and cracked her pelvis but had managed to make it to a nearby road. They’d found her next to Frog Lake. How she’d managed to fall from such a great height, only to end up in the lake, was a mystery in and of itself. But that wasn’t all – she was exhibiting some unusual symptoms.

By the time Adam got to the hospital, she’d been quarantined. Early reports indicated something called SORE, but that changed when a new doctor made a second diagnosis. Elizabeth was to be taken to a special clinic upstate, but Adam was never given any details. Three days later, he was told she died from respiratory failure.

“I’m sorry to hear that,” I said. “So why do you believe she’s still around?”

“That first diagnosis,” Adam tapped his head. “SORE. That’s never mentioned again.”

“Maybe they made a mistake.”

“If they did, why do they refuse to tell me what it is?”

He flipped a couple of pages, turning to a section labeled ‘SORE’.

 

Sudden Onset Rest Event - SORE. According to Adam’s notes, it was a strange condition that could trigger within 72 hours of exposure, and often when a victim submits to rest.

“There have only been a handful of mentions of this,” Adam continued. “One is at a prison. Corporate-sponsored. They get this all the time. The other was an explosion of cases in, uh… Juniper, West Virginia.”

“Not seeing much of a connection here, Adam.”

“There’s like… six branches of… you know what? Never mind. I’m getting off track. Here.”

Grabbing another notebook, he handed it to me. He turned a couple of pages and tapped the page.

“There has never been a resolved case of SORE. Check the numbers if you want.”

“It’s just names.”

“Dozens. All diagnosed, none of them released. They contract this thing and disappear.”

“So it’s fatal.”

“No, fatality means closure. There’re no record of anyone dying from it either. They die from something else, or they just…”

Adam popped his hands, making a poof noise. He looked at me as if expecting some kind of conclusion. I shook my head at him.

“Take this home”, Adam sighed. “I got copies. Just look it over.”

“Alright,” I nodded. “Thanks for lunch.”

“Yeah.”

 

I looked it over later that night, when my job lulled to a halt. I didn’t understand what this had to do with me, or the Tomskog PD, but if I could put this paranoid man’s thoughts to rest, that’d be a win in my book.

A stray thought blew through my mind. There was an incident in West Virginia where plenty of folks had come down with SORE. I vaguely recalled Nick mentioning Tomskog PD being called there once in response to a ‘geological event’. The dates lined up. Checking the records, I could confirm that yes – the same event that Nick and the others were called out for resulted in one of the largest outbreaks of SORE that they’d ever seen. It couldn’t be a coincidence.

SORE was a Tomskog thing, much like the other strange things happening here. Someone had to know something. But chances were that, if no one had told Adam by now, it was for a reason. Either way, I was curious.

 

There was a lot of info in those notebooks. Something about SORE being an “accelerant” rather than an infection in and of itself, and how it didn’t introduce anything new or foreign to the human system. Records of strange behaviors, such as people drinking rainwater and throwing up white globs of parasites. And violence – endless witness statements about violence, cannibalism, and cult-like gatherings.

Some of that stuff sent shivers down my spine. There were links to online forums where people talked about their experiences. They never say it was SORE outright, but the dates and locations lined up. Some of this stuff had been around since the 70’s, maybe earlier.

I knew it was a bad idea to get involved. I’d been an idiot before, and it got me in trouble with Nick and the whole station. But I figured maybe just this once, I could help a grieving father and do some real good. So I texted him.

“Alright,” I wrote. “What do you need?”

 

It was just little things at first. Some names, dates, and locations. Mostly things to corroborate his suspicions about Tomskog PD and their involvement with certain events. Then there were pictures. Mostly picture of people involved in said events. Nothing harmful, just confirmation of things that Adam had already figured out. It was all to build an idea of what usually happened to folks with SORE, as a way to point at  what might’ve happened to Elizabeth.

It all pointed to this company called Hatchet Pharmaceuticals. They were the final red thread in every case. Doctors associated with Hatchet would make a new diagnosis and the patient would disappear. Either the records would abruptly end, or they’d die from something unrelated. It’s like they had a list of “top 10 most common excuses” and just repeated the list over and over. There was even a pattern to it.

But that’s as far as we could get. After a week going over the records, the names, the dates… it all ended with Hatchet. And not even I could open the kind of corporate records that these people held behind closed doors.

 

After that, things got quiet. Adam didn’t know where to go from there, and I didn’t have anything more to give him. My job was business as usual, and there were no major events going down. Yes, I heard a handful of strangeness every now and then, but there were no “all hands on deck” kinda deals. Then, one night, I got a call from Adam.

I met him on a park bench overlooking Frog Lake. It was late, and a cold wind was coming in from the north; bringing a faint smell of pine from the woods. Most of the gravel-filled snow slush had made way to early spring flowers. Even a couple of budding sunflowers, but it was too early to tell what color they were. I could warrant a guess though.

Adam had brought along a little bag that he held in his arms. He looked tired – more tired than usual. He turned to me with a sigh.

 

“I don’t think we’re gonna get much further,” he said. “Thanks for trying though.”

“Hope I could help.”

“You did,” he nodded. “You really did. Thank you. But, uh…”

He adjusted his seat a little, clutching the bag.

“If you got a new lead, can I count on you to follow it?”

“Yeah,” I said. “Yeah, I’m here.”

“Even if I’m not?”

I turned to him with a questioning look. He pulled out a water bottle from his pack, rolling it between his hands.

“I’ll do what I can,” I said. “I mean… I don’t like people disappearing any more than you do.”

 

Adam nodded and took a swig from his water bottle. He cringed a little and handed me a slip of paper.

“Meet me here tomorrow,” he said. “And bring a friend. Someone you trust.”

“What for?”

“A Hail Mary, courtesy of mister Digman.”

Adam knowingly tapped the side of his bottle, got up from his seat, and wandered off. He gave me a final wave, calling back to me.

“See you tomorrow.”

 

I texted Nick three times about it. He got the address, and I tried to underline just how important it was. I got no response. I thought about texting Charlie, but I wasn’t sure she’d have my back the same way Nick did. Also, she was still on sick leave. The thought crossed my mind that I might just cut the crap and talk to the sheriff directly, but I got the impression that he might be involved to a level that might just cause me some trouble if I didn’t play my cards right.

So I said to hell with it and went by myself. I’d have Adam, and maybe that’d be enough. Let the chips fall where they may.

 

The address that Adam’d given me was his house. He lived in alone in a two-bedroom one-story house at the west end of town, not too far from Frog Lake. I got there just after my shift. Still no answer from Nick. I’d texted Adam a couple of times too, just to see what this was really about. I’d been getting a bad feeling about it all day, so I brought my service weapon.

I knocked on his door and waited patiently. After about a minute, I knocked again, looking around. I noticed there was something stuck to the bottom of the door. The corner of a slip of paper. I pulled it out.

‘Door’s open. Go on in,’ it said.

I took out my gun, just in case. I opened the door to a pitch-black hallway. I felt around for the light switch, flipped it, and relaxed my shoulders. It was empty.

 

I got in and closed the doors behind me, making sure nothing was following me. This whole ordeal had started to feel like a spy movie. Like I was some kind of double agent working behind the scenes. I know that wasn’t the case – I was just getting involved with a cold case. That’s all. At least that’s what I kept telling myself.

I noticed another note on the kitchen counter, along with a bottle of wine. It had a nice little blue ribbon tied to it.

‘Make sure I’m secure and call it in. Then you got a trail to follow. Some wine for your trouble.’

 

It was nice wine, but I let it rest on the counter. I looked over the note again.

Adam, what the hell did you do?

 

It was quiet as a grave. I rounded the corner to the bedroom, expecting something horrifying, but… it was nothing. Just a knocked-over chair and an open window. Looking a little closer, I could tell something was off. There were a pair of handcuffs on the floor, ripped open. The chair was broken in three different places. The window hadn’t been unlocked; someone had broken it from the inside and climbed out. There were tracks in the sleet.

Looking back at the scene, I was starting to piece a couple of things together. There was an empty water bottle on the nightstand; the same one Adam’d drunk from the previous night.

A trail to follow. Making sure he was secure. Broken handcuffs.

The idiot had infected himself with something and wanted me to call it in, so I could follow what happened to him. That was his way for me to get an idea of what happened to Elizabeth, and maybe, help her. That’s why he’d asked the day prior.

Except he fucked up. He was on the loose, doing God knows what, and now I was the only one who knew about it.

 

There was a knock on the front door.

I rushed to get it, forgetting to look through the peep hole. I opened it just as Nick raised his hand for a second knock.

“This better be important, rook,” he said. “I got work in the morning.”

“I may have fucked up.”

He adjusted his pink sunglasses, looking past me.

“You got Adam in there?” he asked. “Still looking for his girl, huh?”

“You know him?”

“Rook, I know everyone.”

 

I sat Nick down by the kitchen wine and explained it all to Nick. I told him how Adam and I had talked, how I’d looked into a couple of cases, and how Adam had come up with a plan on his own. I told him I was suspicious, that maybe Adam had infected himself with something. Possibly SORE, the thing he’d talked about. That made Nick perk up.

“SORE? How the fuck did he get a hold of that?”

“I think Digman got it for him.”

“Jesus Ace-of-Base-loving Christ, if that’s… you sure? He got SORE?”

Nick got out of his seat, holding his hands up like everything was a land mine waiting to go off.

“No, that’s… you got no idea,” he continued. “We had to spray down like a hundred cars who was even *suspected* of having caught a *whiff* of that thing. If we got a real SORE case on the loose, that’s…”

Nick pulled out his gun. I followed his lead.

“The DUC catches a scent of this, we’re dead,” he continued. “That ain’t no joke.”

“Alright.”

“Alright?”

“Yeah,” I nodded. “Alright.”

 

There were some tracks outside the bedroom window, heading southward. We followed them past the Frog Lake trail, and into the woods. The snow-slush was clear enough, but we’d figured out where he was heading by then. Adam was going for the police station. Maybe he didn’t know it’d burned down, or maybe he wasn’t thinking clearly. As we made our way through the pine woods, I turned to Nick. He’d taken off his pink sunglasses – an obvious giveaway that he was nervous as all hell.

“So you know about this stuff?” I asked.

“Kinda,” he admitted. “When they called us in for the outbreak in West Virginia, we were given some outlines.”

He held up a hand, counting off on his fingers.

“First, it was airborne. Second, it triggers if you rest within 72 hours. Third, if and when it triggers, there’s no telling what’ll happen.”

“You seen it though?”

Nick didn’t know what to say. He struggled to find the words, leaning his head to and fro.

“I guess I did.”

 

He explained that there was a sort of unspoken partnership between Hatchet Pharmaceuticals and the DUC. Hatchet had the best, if not the only, facility that could house people with SORE. They had experts who knew how to study it, and they had people who knew how to diagnose it.

“But some things you can just tell,” Nick explained. “You can see it from a mile away. Like, most infected people stop to stare at the sky.”

“Creepy.”

“It’s even creeper when you know why.”

I raised an eyebrow at that. Nick rolled his eyes.

“I talked to a Hatchet guy. He said they are sort of programmed to look in the direction of the source of infection, like a… magnetic thing. Sort of like a… migrating bird.”

“Wait, so the source of… up? They look up?”

“It’s somewhere up, yeah.”

“Up,” I scoffed. “That’s fucked.”

 

As we rounded a small hill, we could see the charred ruins of the old police station. Nick and I stopped for a second. We’d lost the tracks some time ago, but there was no doubt in my mind that this was the place. It’d been a straight line.

“If the DUC hears about a case like this, we’re done,” Nick said. “They can’t know.”

“Then this has been for nothing, Nick.”

“I’m telling you – if they hear about it, we’re *done*. They’ll comb through this guy’s entire life, and you’ll pop up. He’ll be put in a box somewhere, and you’ll join him. Then I’ll join him. And then we’re just one big happy meal for some sick Hatchet experimental shit in God-knows-where Fucklahoma together.”

He grabbed my collar and looked me in the eye.

“If he’s infected, no one can ever know. No one. Please.”

I nodded, and Nick let go. I didn’t like it, but this was the guy I chose to trust.

 

We made our way to the burnt-out police station. It didn’t take long for us to pick up more tracks. They were circling the building, as if looking for something. Nick suggested we split up to cover both sides, but I put my foot down. We were sticking together, and that’s that.

Rounding the corner to the back of the building, you could see the sleet  bump up a bit where the old fire door lay flat on the ground. Just a couple of feet ahead, we saw the tracks dip southward. Giving them a wide berth, we stepped sideways, keeping our hands on our weapons.

And there he was.

 

It was Adam, just as I’d seen him the day prior. He had a cut around his left wrist; probably from struggling his way out of those handcuffs. He didn’t look any different physically, but his mannerisms seemed… unusual. He was just standing there, wet all the way up to his knees, staring at the sky.

“You sure he’s infected?” Nick asked. “I ain’t putting down an innocent man.”

“How can we be sure?”

“I don’t know,” Nick admitted. “This shit’s above my pay grade.”

He raised his firearm at Adam, and I followed his lead.

“Hey!” Nick called out. “If you understand me, say something!”

 

Adam turned to us, not lowering his head. I could see the corner of his eyes, as he stared unblinkingly with childlike wonder up at the sky. Tomskog is one of few places where you can still see the stars at night, but in that moment, I sort of wished I couldn’t.

“I need you to speak!” Nick repeated. “Say something!”

Adam took a careful step our way, leaning his head back further. His mouth opened wide, peeling back his lips. And still, he was perfectly balanced and upright. It’s as if his head didn’t even matter.

“Last chance.”

Nothing. Not a glimmer of recognition.

 

Nick looked at me, and I nodded. There was nothing we could do. It was the end of the line.

And the gun went off.

 

Adam dropped to the ground. Nick took another shot for good measure and holstered his weapon. He was breathing like he’d ran a marathon. I had to snap him out of it before he fell into a panic.

“We need bags,” I said. “Lighter fluid. Duct tape. Maybe… maybe a hacksaw. I don’t know.”

“What?”

“If we don’t want the DUC or Hatchet or whoever to know about this, this has to go away.”

Nick nodded, looking back and forth between me and Adam. He tapped me on the shoulder and ran off to get his car, leaving me with the dead body.

 

The moment he was gone, I broke down. It felt like I’d swallowed a block of ice, turning my blood cold. I shivered. I took out one of my gloves to bite down on, because my teeth wouldn’t stop chattering. I wanted to pinch my eyes closed and cry, but I forced them open. I forced myself to look. I had to convince myself this was for the best. If it hadn’t been, then Patrick would’ve put a crossbow bolt in me by now. Maybe.

Adam was lying face up, still staring at the sky. I could count the stars reflected in his eyes. Dying from a gunshot to the head is like putting the body on pause; it doesn’t look like it’s done moving. It just immediately stops what it’s doing, as if ready to go again at any second.

So when he started moving, I barely noticed it.

 

It took my eyes a moment to adjust to what I was seeing. Adam’s head rolled; his eyes looked for me. They weren’t focusing, but they were looking my way. Something convulsed its way up his throat. I could count its throbbing movements.

Little white strands rolled out of the corner of his mouth. Like thick hair. Just a couple inches long. They retracted, then rolled out again. It repeated this a couple of times, growing a little longer every time.

It was like a hand, trying to crawl. Like something was using Adam like a snail’s shell.

 

There was a little pop as a couple of buttons opened on Adam’s bloodstained shirt. A couple more strands of white had erupted from his belly button. He was an outie. Fuck, how I hate that I know that detail. It’s burned into my mind.

I aimed my gun at his head, setting off two more shots, followed by a third shot to the chest. I paused, breathed, and took aim at the neck.

As my finger reached the trigger, something burned my hand. A string of three feet long white strands of white had shot out, digging into my skin. It felt like getting strangled with gasoline-soaked dental floss; this bright painful burn.

 

I took my gun in my left hand and pulled back. At first, I couldn’t lose the strands and ended up pulling Adam along like a dog on a leash. On my second attempt, the strands came loose, curling back up into his head; leaving these blue and yellow burn marks on my hand. I backed away, raising my gun for another round, but I couldn’t get the fingers in my right hand to move like I wanted them to. There was some sort of paralytic effect going on, and I could feel it spreading through my arm.

Aiming with my left hand, and trying to block out the pain, I took aim at his neck. Then he moved. And not just a little pull, but a proper full-body jerking motion. He rolled backwards, slowly, letting his head move every which way with full abandon; dragging it through the sleet and gravel. He got up on his knees, letting his head roll back to once again look at the stars.

I fired. I fired every bullet I had, tearing out his left tendon, his shoulder, his neck, and part of his eye. There was no way he could survive it, and yet; there he was. Standing up like it was the most natural thing in the world; only limping slightly from the torn fiber in his foot.

I tried to reload, but I dropped my magazine. I wasn’t used to doing it with just one hand. By the time I got it, Adam had turned my way. As I raised my gun towards him, he burst into a sprint.

 

I rounded the corner to the burned-out station. I could taste the ashes, despite my dry mouth. Part of me just wanted to keep running, thinking there was no way I couldn’t outrun a guy with a torn foot. Then again, it didn’t seem to slow him down; it just changed the way he hobbled. He was fast as hell, almost tripping over himself; using his body weight to go faster in an ever-falling motion.

Something was burning in my leg. Whatever had attached to my hand earlier had done a number on me, and I was feeling something all the way down in my leg. Maybe I was the one with a disadvantage?

In the moment, I wasn’t thinking that clearly. This was a matter of seconds. I decided to take my chances indoors. Sure, the roof had collapsed, but the locker room and the sheriff’s office were solid enough. So when Adam came charging around the corner, I rolled my way inside a window, letting my thick jacket absorb the crunch of shattered glass on the floor.

 

I plopped down on the floor, but I couldn’t get back up. My right leg wasn’t working. It didn’t contract. I crawled my way across the floor, but as soon as Adam’s shape popped up in the window, I didn’t hesitate. I put six shots in him. It didn’t even slow him down. Long strands of white shot out from a bullet wound in his neck in a web across the walls. It pulled his body inside the building, almost reluctantly.

His body flopped onto the floor unceremoniously as the strands contracted. I propped myself up against the opposing wall, firing every damn bullet I had. The pops echoed against the bare concrete walls, ringing my inner ear with every shake. My hands were stained with ash and sleet, but I could barely feel the cold.

With the final click of my gun, Adam was still standing. What remained of his head still leaned back. White strands poked out of every corner of his body, searching blindly for something to grasp. Something like me.

 

I couldn’t get up. My leg was done. My right arm, too. My breathing was shallow. My heart was pounding, but I could barely feel it. There was just this pumping feeling in my left arm, but nothing in my chest. My trigger finger retracted with every beat of my heart, but there was nothing but empty clicking left.

The white strands found the steel tip of my right boot. They curled across the surface, but found nothing to grasp. They retracted, aiming higher. A couple of them found the edge of my boot, and the warmth of my leg. I should’ve felt a burn, as I saw another blue and yellow discoloration form on my skin, but there was nothing. The strands retracted a third time, now knowing full and well exactly where I was.

I closed my eyes, and covered my face with my left hand; leaving my empty gun on the floor.

 

Then, another shot rang out. Not a pistol this time, but a shotgun.

I opened an eye to spot Nick in the window. He’d blown a hole the size of a fist through Adam’s shoulder blade. Click-click, then another shot. Adam’s body collapsed face-first next to me, the white strands struggling to shelter themselves.

He climbed in through the window, emptying every slug he had into that body. Using my left hand and leaning against the wall, I managed to get up. I had to jump on one leg, and almost slipped on a handful of debris, but I made my way across the room. Joining Nick, I looked back, only to see the floor around Adam sprawling with these long white ringworm-looking things.

“Can… can you make it to the car?” Adam asked.

“I think so.”

“You… you go ahead. I got this.”

 

By the time I’d made it back to Nick’s car, there was a fire coming from the building. It was a pretty solid cover-up; a fire in a burnt-out building? No one would think to look twice.

Nick helped me into the passenger seat, excused himself, and stepped outside to throw up. He kept mouthing ‘oh my God’ over and over, banging his hand against the hood of the car. It took him a solid five minutes or so before he collapsed into the driver’s seat. He looked over at me. I didn’t know what to say. We just sat there for a minute.

“I’m sorry,” I said. “I didn’t know who to call.”

“No, it’s okay,” he said. “You’d be dead if you didn’t.”

“Probably, yeah.”

We just looked at each other for a moment, trying to let those words sink in. This wasn’t empty platitudes. I’d actually be dead.

 

“We gotta keep you up for 72 hours,” Nick said. “You should be good after that.”

“I’m infected?”

“Yeah. I might be too.”

He revealed a spot on his neck. A bloodstain from the shotgun blast.

“Might be nothing. I dunno. But we don’t wanna risk it.”

“Alright, yeah.”

I tried to close the car door, but my right hand still wasn’t working. Nick leaned over and closed it for me, giving me a pat on the shoulder.

“We’re gonna be okay,” he said. “If we just keep our mouths shut, we’ll be okay.”

“Sorry I got you into this,” I sighed. “Really.”

“You don’t get to do that,” Nick snapped back. “Not this time. If I’d told you about this shit earlier, maybe I could’ve-”

 

We calmed down, taking another deep breath. Well, as deep as my lungs permitted. There were no words, so I just raised my left hand at him.

“Partners. But, for real, right?”

He shook my left hand, giving me a solemn nod.

It was a very nice experience. I woke up at 5 30 today and got on the bus. Had to rush when walking the rest of the way to the plasma center because I had to use the bathroom very bad but luckily no accidents and I made it . 

Then during the plasma giving I listened to music and then an hour later I was finished and received 90 bucks that was loaded on the card they give you. I always take the money out and put the money back into my varo bank card. 

As I went to seven eleven I noticed a guy with an open bear in his hand and noodles . As soon as I walk out then go to CVS to load my varo card then walk out of that store, the same guy was trying to get me to do something for him. I was walking fast and he still didn't get the hint. He had some dollars. I guess he wanted me to buy him some beer or vodka. 

Like dude I have no criminal record nor am I going to just jump into drama or get involved in with a total stranger. I guess he got the hint once I get walking and politely said no with my right hand . 

Now I can buy more chicken and Mac and cheese for food and try not to go berserk when I go to Starbucks, which is my safe haven. That's the place where I write lyrics and enjoy my coffee and free refills for coffee. 

Food stamps reload on the fifth. And if unemployment denies me next week I can get on short term disability and it just takes 1 week and I have to pick up my refill for olanzapine that the doctor inputted in the system yesterday . So busy but productive day.

1gi12zc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gi12zc,spoke with cops today ,"as the title said, had a surprisingly pleasant talk with some of the douchiest looking cops i’ve ever seen. 

i try not to judge, but we all know how cops can be, and these guys fit the visual stereotype of dickhead cops to a tee (they were in uniform)
have been in Campbell, CA for a couple months but just got the surron Wednesday and only out 60ish miles on it so far, all in the city and its main streets with like 10 miles on a trail 

i don’t ride like a dick, i’d say i’m very responsible and mindful of all others in the public space. regardless, cops can be a dick and threaten legal recourse over the bikes if they want. The Philz coffee shop nearby has had maaaaaad cops in it every morning, but no other decent coffee spots nearby so i staid there. when i was getting ready to leave, the douchiest looking on of them all (again man, i’m a very loving, non-judgemental person but the Police system in our country is broken and attracts broken people looking to abuse power. save that convo for the pm’s and we can have a legit talk about our opinions) and has a very chill convo w me. 

in my older post, i mentioned waiting to sticker my bike for as long as possible. I’ll be using it mostly in-city on public roads, but i don’t wheelie or ride like a dick so i’d hopefully have no issues, and that’s essentially everything the cop said to me. Campbell is a … very, very white-washed / waspy town, cute as hell but you know the vibes, old money types. i’d figure of all the places, i’d have the most issues here. guess not :)

moral of the story, be kind / be safe / be respectful and responsible and you really shouldn’t have any issues. too many people see riders online playing the victim card after doing obviously heinous shit. grow up, take accountability for your actions, and live to ride another day void of legal / physical complications 

some attached photos of my morning ride bc i’m soooo in love w this lil thing. anybody in the bay area tryna link up and ride, HMU! looking to make more friends willing to mob these around

much love from Cali ✊🏼💛

1gi10dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLincolnLawyer/comments/1gi10dg/nine_reasons_eddie_is_not_the_real_eddie_rojas/,Nine reasons Eddie is not the real Eddie Rojas,"'Eddie' is not the real Eddie Rojas for the following reasons:

1. Haller didn't recognize Eddie at all when he meets Eddie at the courthouse, and says, 'Eddie? Eddie Rojas?', and 'You really grew up'. Eddie replies, 'Got tired of kids picking on me. Started working out in high school.' So, Haller hasn't seen him since grade school, and which likely means that Hayley likely hasn't seen him since then either, so she wouldn't necessarily recognize him.

2. When Haller goes to meet with Sly Jr., and finds DEA Agent DeMarco in his SUV, Eddie is no where to be found. When Haller later asks Eddie where he was, Eddie said, 'I went to go get coffee'. Eddie didn't drink coffee--he drank green goop.

3. When Haller goes to meet Trina for the first time and she takes a call from Sly Sr., it is obvious that Sly Sr. knew that Haller was there without Trina telling Sly. Cisco questions how Sly Sr. knew Haller was there, and the consensus is that someone is following Haller. 

4. Eddie refused to go into the prison when Halller goes to visit Sly Sr. Probably because criminals are often prohibited from visiting/must apply in advance and get approval, and/or his real identity would have been revealed.

5. Eddie's case was easily dismissed after Haller sees an obvious hole in Mr. Schwartz's story (the keys), and exposes Mr. Schwartz as a cheater, thus introducing Mrs. Schwartz as character. And, now Eddie needs a job (Haller now knows that Eddie can clearly drive a car...). 

6. In the final episode, Mrs. Schwartz shows up at the office needing a divorce lawyer. More than 16,000 lawyers in LA, and she chooses Haller, when all we've seen Haller do is criminal defense work. Mrs. Schwartz is either there to spy, or she'll admit later to the setup.

7. We never saw Eddie's mom, Esparanza Rojas, at Eddie's funeral. Why? Cause she wasn't actually there/too sick to attend/or it was a different woman. In the final episode, Haller says he is going to give some of the his contingency fee from Julian's lawsuit to Eddie's mom. It will be interesting when he shows up to see Mrs. Rojas and 'little Eddie' is there/alive in prison/died a few years ago.

8. Multiple instances of Haller on the phone in the car and Eddie listening/reacting. No reason to do that unless Eddie overhearing is relevant to the plot.

9. When Haller asks Eddie about his cousin, Jorge, who Eddie claimed he visited in prison when he was little, Eddie replies, 'What?' He forgot the prison story/name he had given Haller earlier that day.

My theory is that Eddie is a plant from the Hector Moya cartel to monitor Haller. A competing cartel tried to take Haller out to keep Moya in jail, killing Eddie.

Edit: 

Changed Sly Jr. to Sly Sr. in point #3 and #4

Add #10. When Haller talks to DeMarco is Haller's SUV, Haller asks DeMarco, 'Are you following me?, to which DeMarco replies, 'No, I'm not following you'. DeMarco worked for a rival cartel than Hector Moya's cartel, and he'd naturally want to keep tabs on Eddie if Eddie worked for a rival cartel.",5,1730566841.0,TheLincolnLawyer,5,0.78,False

I am in the process of starting a pathfinder 2e campaign after finishing a two year 5e game. One player gravitated towards the Witch class because of its familiar-centric abilities, and wants to take a bunch of feats to buff their familiar buddy.

We’re going to be using free archetype, which made me immediately look at Familiar Master and Familiar Sage archetypes. The dedication for Familiar Master (level 2) gives you a familiar, or gives you the Enhanced Familiar feat if you already have one. Sounds great for a witch!

And the Familiar Sage archetype (Tian Xia, level 4) can be taken even if you only have one feat in Familiar Master! I thought this would be a good path for the witch player, but then I realized the Familiar Sage archetype just gives you the Enhanced Familiar feat, with no contingency for if you already have that feat.

It sucks because the rest of Familiar Sage would be very cool for my player’s concept. If they want to take Familiar Sage, do they just have to deal with getting literally nothing from the dedication, while everyone else gets cool level 4 archetype feats? Are there rules for if you are given a feat you already have? Should I just give them the Incredible Familiar feat, even though that’s like level 10 and invalidates part of Familiar Master? Should I homebrew something?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! :)

These business interests that they have are effectively side projects that are not their main source of income and not the concern of our legal work for them so I’ve never looked too much into things. 

They basically act as investors or silent partners. The businesses to my mind seem like “lifestyle businesses” that don’t really have space or need for an investor. Eg they produce enough profit to provide an income to the owners who work in these businesses but not for anyone else and I can’t understand why an owner in these businesses would give someone an equity stake who doesn’t work in the business over taking a loan from them. 

I have done investment work for clients but this is usually in the high growth / tech sector where there is a possibility of a large return in future if the company is sold or listed etc. but I don’t see that being the case for a small high street business like a car garage, local coffee shop, a fast food takeaway, or local BnB. Yes these businesses may be sold in future but they aren’t going to be sold for the crazy returns an equity investor usually looks for in my experience.

I do breastfeed so I’m still waking up to feed him but my husband takes him right after that so I can go back to sleep.

I'd like to go with a projector because we don't want the room to always have a fixed screen present (via a wall mounted tv or permanent projector screen against the wall.

Our wall width where the projector would face is 88 inches wide. The distance from that wall to the opposite wall is 170 inches.

I'd love to get a simple projector set up. My first thought was to get an ultra short throw projector so that we wouldn't need to attach a projector to the ceiling (where we would then need to have a long enough cord/plug to reach the outlet...about 10 feet away). There is an outlet very near where the UST projector would be set up. However, I can't seem to find an ALR screen that would match the wall width, that can be hidden when not in use, and that isn't incredibly expensive (> $4k). UST projectors are also expensive and it seems crazy to be spending a ton of money on this. The goal would to be to spend $3,500 or less.

Maybe a UST projector/screen isn't the best set up? But it'd be great to find something that is easy to use and doesn't require a lengthy set up every time we'd like to watch a movie. Our current system consists of carrying an oversized tv screen out of our closet in a separate room, placing it on the living room coffee table, setting up an extension cord to plug it in, setting up speakers, plugging in our laptop to an outlet, connecting it to the monitor, watching the movie, and then undoing all of that and carrying everything back to its storage area. Kind of exhausting. Cheap and available. But exhausting.

We know next to nothing about projectors and this journey of finding the right fit has been a challenge. Any ideas or equipment recommendations or good sources to help us explore realistic options would be really appreciated!

Keen to get into the hobby a bit and the obvious purchase I can see is a Sage/Breville Barista Pro. Accessible price point and fairly favourable reviews. Most attractive to me is the rapid 3s heat up - I have busy mornings with a commute and am not always the most organised.

However - would I notice a difference in my coffee at this stage? It feels like I'd be paying more for an objectively less convenient machine in exchange for the better ""feel"" of the machine but not much else.

I'm a 30F who has tried various ADHD medications, both stimulants and non-stimulants. A year ago, I started taking Vyvanse 50mg, which worked well for about 8-9 months. I took it in the morning on an empty stomach, then had breakfast and coffee an hour later. While my symptoms would return after 2 PM, I never experienced crashes—just a lack of motivation for less engaging tasks.

After the 8-9 months, my psychiatrist suggested splitting my dose: 30mg in the morning and 20mg at the middle of the day (~12). This adjustment significantly improved my productivity for the whole day for three months, until about 5-6 days ago, when I started feeling extremely tired 3-4 hours after the second dose. 

Nothing in my routine has changed, and I’m unsure why this fatigue has started. I plan to discuss this with my psychiatrist, but I’d like to know if anyone else has experienced similar issues. Did it get better for you, and what changes helped? Previously (more than a year ago), I switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse due to fatigue, so I'm hoping for some insight into this new challenge. Thank you!",1,1730566014.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I am looking for a female roommate to live with me. You would get two full bedrooms and a shared bathroom. We have a porch, backyard with fire pit, and in-unit laundry. I live in Gordon Square right by the movie theater, coffee shops, restaurants, and Edgewater. 

A little bit about me: I am a 34 y/o teacher with two cats. I am friendly, clean, and mostly keep to myself during the week. I would need someone that is clean, responsible, respectful of boundaries, and doesn’t party during the week due to my job (this is a dealbreaker). Cats are ok. LGBTQ+ and cannabis friendly. Move in date would be January ideally but I can be flexible. 

I will send pics once I know you are a legitimate person. ",12,1730565955.0,Cleveland,0,1.0,False

Since i’ve been single every sexual encounter i’ve had the woman would be thrilled to put her mouth on me. Seriously every single one. And I wouldn’t even initiate it because i’ve been groomed not to. No joke, One time i met up with this woman i met on a swingers app. We met at a coffee shop to get to know each other a little better. We’re sitting there chillin & vibing. She takes a sip of her coffee and says “So you wanna get your dick sucked?” And yea she gave me head in the front seat of her truck in the parking lot. Lol Before all this i was thinking.

I'm a 30F who has tried various ADHD medications, both stimulants and non-stimulants. A year ago, I started taking Vyvanse 50mg, which worked well for about 8-9 months. I took it in the morning on an empty stomach, then had breakfast and coffee an hour later. While my symptoms would return after 2 PM, I never experienced crashes—just a lack of motivation for less engaging tasks.

After the 8-9 months, my psychiatrist suggested splitting my dose: 30mg in the morning and 20mg at the middle of the day (~12). This adjustment significantly improved my productivity for the whole day for three months, until about 5-6 days ago, when I started feeling extremely tired 3-4 hours after the second dose. 

Nothing in my routine has changed, and I’m unsure why this fatigue has started. I plan to discuss this with my psychiatrist, but I’d like to know if anyone else has experienced similar issues. Did it get better for you, and what changes helped? Previously (more than a year ago), I switched from Ritalin to Vyvanse due to fatigue, so I'm hoping for some insight into this new challenge.

I notice two girls to my right, I make eye contact with one of them and I compliment her on her costume because she was wearing something on Halloween. We chat for a bit and I eventually get my drink, so I ask her for her number and ask her out suggesting to go for coffee or a drink another time before I head out. She gladly accepts and gives me my number. We go our separate ways.

I go to my table with my friends and it can't seat all of us as we're a big group ad it's a busy night at the bar. About 10 minutes later, I looked around to see if there were any free chairs anywhere. I spot only one chair free in the entire bar, which is at the table of the girl whose number I got who is sitting with her friends. I go over to the table to ask someone if I could take that seat.

When I got to the table, everyone was in a conversation except for her, so I asked her as I didn't want to interrupt other people in their conversation. I look at her and ask ""Is this seat taken?"". She says it isn't, so I ask if I could take the seat back with me. She says yes, so I smile and thank her, taking the seat back to my table to talk with my friends.

As I was leaving the bar to go home, I ran into the same girl, so I asked her about something separately. It then transpires that she was upset with me for taking the seat away rather than sitting and talking to her, ending the sentence with something like ""Maybe I'm just overreacting from being drunk"".

After I realised why she was upset and when I understood it from her perspective, I tried to explain that it was a genuine misunderstanding, what the thought process was from my side, and tried to assure her that I didn't intend to hurt her feelings and that I apologised if I did.

I woke up this morning to find out that she blocked my number. With all of that said, am I the asshole? Personally, I think she's overreacting even in light of me apologising and explaining that it was a genuine misunderstanding, though I'm happy to admit if I've done something wrong and take responsibility. 

I intended to spend time with her on a separate occasion when it was just the two of us. I didn't talk to any other girls that night or ask anyone for their number. The reason why I didn't talk to her more that night was because I was with my friends and wanted to spend time with them, as well as her being with her friends and me not want to take her away from them. Even if we had sat and talked, I would've felt really awkward considering her friends would've been right there and witnessed everything.",10,1730565303.0,AmItheAsshole,17,0.86,False

1gi054i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductInsights/comments/1gi054i/my_8week_experience_with_king_maker_the_good_the/,"My 8-Week Experience with King Maker: The Good, the Bad, and the Verdict","I'm sharing my personal experience with King Maker, a premium testosterone booster supplement that's been making waves in the fitness community. As someone who's always on the lookout for natural ways to optimize my testosterone levels, I was excited to give King Maker a try.

**The Good:**

* Increased energy and drive: I noticed a significant boost in my energy levels after about 10 days of use. My workouts felt more intense, and I was able to push out a few extra reps on my compound lifts.
* Improved libido and sexual function: Around the 3-week mark, I started noticing improvements in my libido and sexual function. Erection strength and frequency were definitely enhanced, and I felt more confident and assertive in my daily life.
* Muscle gains and strength: By the end of the 8 weeks, I had gained about 4 lbs of lean muscle mass while my body fat stayed relatively stable. My strength gains on my bench, squat, and deadlifts were significant, and I noticed improvements in my vascularity and muscle fullness.

**The Bad:**

* Acne: I experienced slightly increased acne on my shoulders and back, but it wasn't too concerning.
* Mood swings: I noticed that my mood and irritability were a bit more volatile at times, likely due to the testosterone boost.

**The Verdict:**

Overall, I was impressed with King Maker's effects on my physique, performance, and demeanor. The ingredients seemed to work synergistically to enhance multiple factors of masculinity. While it's not a miracle supplement, it can be a powerful tool when combined with proper diet and training.

**Is it worth the investment?**

That depends on your goals, budget, and personal philosophy on supplementation. If you're willing to invest in a premium, multi-faceted testosterone support supplement, King Maker is a viable option. However, it's crucial to have realistic expectations and understand that supplements are just one piece of the puzzle.

**Final thoughts:**

King Maker is a solid choice for those looking to optimize their testosterone levels and masculine performance. However, it's essential to prioritize a balanced lifestyle, healthy habits, and proper training to maximize its effects. Stay patient, and don't expect overnight results.

**Edit:** I've added some FAQs to address common questions about King Maker.

**FAQs:**

* Is King Maker safe? Generally, yes, but consult your doctor if you have any pre-existing health conditions or are taking medications.
* Does King Maker work? Yes, but individual results may vary based on age, genetics, lifestyle habits, and consistency of use.
* How long does King Maker take to kick in? Most users start noticing effects within 2-3 weeks, but maximum results typically occur after 8-12 weeks.
* What's the difference between Alpha Grind and King Maker? Alpha Grind is an instant coffee mix for daily energy and focus, while King Maker is a testosterone booster supplement for long-term hormone optimization.",1,1730564485.0,ProductInsights,0,1.0,False

when its peak and im sweating and doing five things at once and stopping every now and then to grab an iced water, straw, sleeve, sugar, etc for customers it gets very grating to have customers come in and point to a drink and ask ""is that mine?""

if it says your name and its your order, then yes, its yours. im reaching a point where being nice is feeling difficult. does anyone else experience this?

things like ordering a black coffee @ the register/mobile app then going to the busy barista on bar for cream, sugar, more room...why didnt you ask for that to begin with? 

people who come in and just plant themselves on handoff so others cant reach their items, so i have to stop what im doing and ask a grown adult to have consideration for others. 


people reaching over the counter to grab carafes, sugars, stir sticks, cups, lids, you name it, really bothers me. im learning to ignore it but i find it very gross to reach behind bar and touch something and usually end up tossing whatever was touched. 

maybe this is just burnout that people talk about. today i snapped at someone because they reached over the counter and began looking through the orders. nothing crazy just a stern ""you shouldnt touch things that arent yours."" not a good moment but man im tired of people's impatience.
