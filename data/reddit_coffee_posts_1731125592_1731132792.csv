https://preview.redd.it/xv9cfolnhtzd1.jpg?width=1792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a51e5d347db8b178d5ffa8fbba43d6badc752b36



\### 1. \*“Rolex Dreams on a Timex Budget”\*



Let’s talk about luxury watch alternatives—basically, they’re like the generic cereal of the watch world, but way classier! You know, when you see that Rolex ad, and suddenly you’re imagining yourself on a yacht, sipping a drink with a name you can’t pronounce. But then you look at your wallet and realize, “Yep, I’m sticking to the \*‘Captain Crunch of watches’\* for now.”



\### 2. \*“Look Like a Million Bucks Without Spending It”\*



Luxury watch alternatives are watches that say, “I look like a million bucks, but I only cost about a couple of hundred… maybe less if you caught me on sale!” They’re all about getting that refined look without the hit to the bank account. No trust fund? No problem. Because these watches are designed to give you the feel, the style, and even some of the functions of luxury watches without having to sell your car to buy one.



\### 3. \*“But Wait, Are These Knock-Offs?”\*



Let’s clear one thing up: we’re not talking about counterfeits. Nope, no shady transactions here! We’re talking about brands that design their own watches with a vibe inspired by the big names. So no, you won’t find a fake Rolex with a suspiciously spelled logo here. Instead, you’ll get brands that make original watches that happen to look like you’ve got very expensive taste.



\### 4. \*“Swiss Movements, Not Swiss Bank Accounts”\*



A lot of these alternatives still use top-quality movements, like Swiss or Japanese, so they’re not skimping on the insides. It’s like having that perfectly styled house that looks designer but really is just \*very well IKEA’d\*. You can tell your friends it’s “Swiss movement” with a totally straight face—just leave out the part about \*not\* needing to fly to Switzerland to pick it up.



\### 5. \*“But What’s the Real Difference?”\*



You might be wondering, “Well, what’s the real difference?” Well, my friend, luxury alternatives might lack some of the \*hyper-premium\* details like 24-karat gold, the word “Rolex” stamped inside every nook and cranny, and maybe a waiting list as long as a New York brunch line. But for the price? These watches get you about 95% of the same effect, minus the heart attack every time you almost bump into a doorframe.



\### 6. \*“Who’s Wearing These?”\*



Believe it or not, watch snobs aren’t the only people with style! Luxury alternatives are worn by everyone from style influencers to, yes, even some watch collectors who’ve realized they can \*appreciate the look\* without diving into debt. It’s like loving a designer jacket but opting for a more sensible (and much cheaper) dupe. Besides, not everyone’s walking around with a jeweler’s loupe ready to inspect your wrist.



\### 7. \*“The Best Ones to Look For”\*



Brands like Seiko, Citizen, and Orient are well-loved for creating stylish watches with quality craftsmanship. Then you’ve got the lesser-knowns, the micro-brands that make beautiful pieces that look just as sleek but are a fraction of the price. Shopping for these is like hitting a jackpot—you get to wear something stunning \*and\* brag about the great deal you scored.



\### 8. \*“Watches as Versatile as Your Wardrobe”\*



One of the best things about these alternatives is the freedom to mix and match. If you have a luxury watch, you might think twice about wearing it to the beach or a backyard BBQ. With an alternative, go ahead and live a little! Wear it with a tux, wear it to a coffee shop, heck—wear it while you change your car oil if you’re feeling particularly bold. 



\### 9. \*“The Downside: It’s Not an Investment”\*



Unlike a true luxury watch, alternatives won’t appreciate over time. They won’t be the retirement plan your grandkids are cashing in on. But hey, they’re not costing you a down payment either. So the choice is yours: wear a watch as a statement piece or wear one that can \*actually tell time\* without needing a loan.



\### 10. \*“Why Go Alternative?”\*



In the end, a luxury watch alternative says, “I appreciate fine craftsmanship, style, and functionality, but I also appreciate not having a bank panic attack.” It’s the watch for the modern person who values style but also a good deal. Because, really, do you need a million-dollar watch to tell you it’s time for lunch?",1,1731132485.0,GoldWatches,0,1.0,False

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gfpeeh/aita_for_showing_my_friend_how_to_set_a_timer_on/)**: October 30, 2024**

This happened two weeks ago, and I do think that I am an asshole in showing it to him and making his son be really ticked off at me.

My(55 F) friend (35 M) has a 10 year old son, who for the past month on the weekends would go beyond his curfew of 9 pm to get off the computer and get ready for bed by 10 pm. He would get off the computer like around midnight but in the middle of the night, my friend would hear his son's computer turn on around 3 am.

I went over to bring him some boxes as he and his son are moving to a new apartment in a new city in three weeks. While we were sitting down and drinking coffee and shooting the breeze about the joys of moving, thankfully, he had paid vacation time and PTO that he hadn't used up yet. He made mention about his son on the weekends staying up past his 9 pm curfew on getting off the computer to get ready for bed and then hearing him get up in the middle of the night to play on the computer.

I made an offhand suggestion about setting a timer for his computer to turn off. He looked at me like I grew two heads. He asked is that even possible?

I was like yeah, just look on the computer. We had to look up how to put it on, by googling it. He never knew he could set a timer for the computer to turn off. He even googled if it was possible to set the timer to allow the computer to be turned on, I didn't even think that was possible, till we found it on google.

So we got the son's computer set to turn off at 9 pm and wake up at 6 am.

He was very proud of himself for setting it up. I had told him that his son will get used to the boundaries now. Do tell him the consequences of his actions has warranted a new punishment if he doesn't follow curfew by getting off the computer by 9 pm.

Well, I got a phone call that night from my friend, his son was ticked off about his computer turning off at 9 pm. I could hear his son screaming at him for being a bad father and that he's going to be reported for this at school. I told him, the school won't do anything beyond asking what you did, might want to drop him off and go speak with the principal about this, so whatever your son tries to get you into trouble, would be canceled out by you talking to the principal and the teacher probably would be sent a message pertaining to him so he cannot get you into any trouble since this happens at the library and at our school computers too.

My friend asked me if we did the right thing by doing this to him. I told him we did the right thing, he has to learn how to make due with the time he has on the computer before it shuts down, like he has to when he goes to the public library on Saturday, as the computers there shuts down at 4:45 pm.

His son has been constantly screaming at him for allowing me to destroy his computer time, and it is constant for the last two weeks. I seriously feel like I am the AH in this as I cheated his son out of being responsible with his computer time, but his dad asked me for advice and I gave it and his dad did it.

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: NTA Child is throwing a childish tantrum. Dealing with them is part of being a parent.

>**OOP:** That's what I told my friend, but he feels like he's also the AH. I told him you told him there will be consequences and now he has it. He'll get used to it.

Commenter: NTA - Children need structure and boundaries. This no different than having a bedtime set at 9pm to have to turn the TV off and go to bed. So, the kid threatening to report the parent to his school for...parenting, is nonsense. The school will probably laugh at him. I know I would if he complained about this.

>**OOP:** His school already been informed about it the next day about the new timer on the computer, the principal thinks that is a genius idea to enforce curfew for the kid, since this kid has been in trouble with falling asleep in class. He actually asked how did you do it, my friend told him that he and his best friend googled it and set it up.  
He told me that the principal is putting it in the monthly school newsletter that is sent out to all the parents. He said this might help the parents keep the kids from becoming too obsessed about being online all the time.

Commenter: NTA, you gave your friend the tools to parent his child, apparently. How exactly a 10 yo gets away with being on the computer 3+ hours past curfew is a wonder.

Seems like the expected reaction from a 10 yo when they get something taken away. You didn't set the rules and you are not enforcing them, you just enabled your friend to parent effectively.

>**OOP:** Thank you.  
I think in time his son will learn to accept the new restriction as my friend told me that when he gets to be 14, the timer will change from 9 pm to 10 pm, as homework will be harder and will require longer time online. I think that is fair for him since junior high or middle school for some might be hard on him as it was hard on me back in the day.  
The kid likes to claim to have turn the computer off by turning off the monitor and acting like he's about to get into bed, his dad has caught him several times, spanked him and told him to go to bed.  
I'm just glad to be of help to my friend.

Commenter: NTA Why would you consider yourself TA for sharing parenting tips. We parents do that all the time. BTW did you tell your friend what he did on the computer can be done for the TV and other electronic devices. Have you shared with him how to lock down his router and change the password. That one is the favorite I pull out and share all time. Your kid doesn't want to do chores. Cut off the internet.

>**OOP:** His son is mainly fixated on the computer, so the TV is his domain. I will suggest to him about the router and changing the password on it weekly to throw the kid off at times.  
His son does do chores, it is just when he gets on his computer, nothing will take him off it. Till I showed his dad how to turn the computer off at a certain time.

***OOP is voted NTA***

**Update (Same Post): November 2, 2024 (3 days later)**

UPDATE: I showed my friend this thread this morning at breakfast and he sends his thanks to everyone for their comments and since I had posted he has moved to his new home in his new city.

He has told his son that actions has consequences. He has been a bit lax on the punishment as he had to work two jobs to keep a roof over their heads and everything else, till last month when his boss gave him a nice raise and a bonus for his hard work, which warranted the move to the new apartment which is closer to his job and he has quit his other job so he could focus more on his son.

With him being the sole parental unit his son has, he has admitted that he allowed him to be without severe punishments which got us to this thread as he was worried about his sleep schedule for school.

His son has gotten used to the timer on the computer and he's doing better as he and his son had a long talk about the computer and his son admits that he was getting too attached to his computer and the games he plays on the computer. To which I am impressed with how open his son was with realizing that he was getting too attached to something that was causing him problems.

His son has accepted the timer in the end and the doubt that he did wrong by his son no longer troubles his mind. He thanks everyone even those who told him that he was a bad dad, he's learning and growing.

1gn3nc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gn3nc2/newly_33f_married_problem_36m_whether_to_end/,Newly 33f married problem 36m whether to end?,"Sorry this is long

Just want to discuss my situation. Got married 3 months ago after dating for 3 years. I was given a job a month before the wedding in a specific location which happens to be my hometown where most of my family live. I am in a career where at a junior level I have no control of where I live, as the location is allocated randomly. My spouse knew this the first time I ever met them and I constantly told them this. We knew for a year before the marriage that I was due to have this random allocation but my spouse always thought I'd go on to do the traditional thing which was to live with them and their family. In reality I was kind of lucky to get allocated my hometown- sure it's not where I thought we'd end up but family is nearby for childcare and I think I need them near me at the moment as I feel like I myself am on the verge of a mental breakdown with all the stress I'm going through at the moment. Alongside this I work a demanding job that has a huge number of out of hours work associated with it so as a couple we agreed that it made sense for my spouse to take on the majority commute. We looked at an in between location but it was just way out of budget to move there.

We put an offer on a house a month after the wedding in my hometown and since then we've had continual arguments to the point where it's all become too much for me. 

My spouse does an hour commute at the moment but this is going to go up to 1.5 hours and they are really worried about that. They keep telling me that they are moving to my city and that they feel like a guest in this city and that it will never be home to them. Throughout the entire homebuying process they have repeatedly tried to call things off one day and then agree to proceed with the purchase later. They've told me their depression is getting worse at the thought of moving and that they're anticipating gping back on antidepressants throughout the entire time they will live in this area. They tell me they're giving up their whole life to make this move (but with this move they will still be commuting to their workplace which is in their hometown 3 days a week, so not totally moving away). Spouse likes to walk and go to coffee shops but it is about a 25 minute walk to a coffee shop from the house which they're not happy with, however the location of the house was picked. They don't have much of a social network back home - the pull factor is that work and gym are there as well as their mother. They've stated to the mother that they just wanted to live in their current house forever. 

To complicate matters further the MIL has got involved and made statements to my spouse saying its not fair that you're moving to the in laws and not staying with us, the training contract is for 3 years and then you must move back, your in laws will take all your money etc, she has gossiped to other relatives in their family saying that my family are controlling which isnt true and this is all causing me to be very stressed and panicky within myself. I don't feel settled and contented in the marriage and I feel stressed and pressurised. The MIL has tried to control a few things and ive found her dictating to me what bed size I should buy, disagreeing with some of my decor ideas for the home etc, disagreeing with a religious tradition that I want to do as a house warming thing etc and it's griding me down. The MIL told my spouse they need to count down every month of the next 3 years until they move back home. 

Originally the plan was to stay for 3 years for my training contract and then move to the area where my spouse is from but given the issues with the MIL and severe lack of support I feel, I am genuinely worried for my mental health and that I will have a nervous breakdown if I make the move there. I feel that she's only looking at her self interests and a major point of us staying in the area I'm currently based in is that we woukd have free childcare from my family which we would not have to the same degree in my spouses hometown. 

I think ultimately what bothers me is ho I deal with my spouse at the moment with this move whilst protecting my own mental health..  I have no known me tal health illness at the moment but the marriage is hugely stressful and I don't feel at all like a loved up newly wed. I feel so stuck and so lost and part of me feels guilty for my partner having to move this way but then I also feel that they're struggling to commit to me. I don't know whether my whole perspective is warped? 

Can anyone suggest anything I can try to try and make the current move or things easier with my spouse because I feel like it's got to a point where I'm really really down about the whole marriage? Can anyone also suggest what i can do to make the marriage better - i dont know if this is a temporary blip im reaction to my spouse makkng a major life change or whether we were incompatible with each other and should not have got married in the first place. With everything going on i just have severe doubts about whether we can survive and the repeated arguments where my spouse then brings their mother into it all is really stressful. This isn't my idea of marriage and my spouses constant stress is making me doubt their commitment but at the same time I know I have to be understanding since they are making a massive sacrifice.

\- Height: 5'10""

\- Starting Weight: 209lbs (Nov 2023)

\- Current Weight: 139lbs (Nov 2024)



The ""Before"" Me:

\- Couldn't run for a minute without sounding like Darth Vader

\- Had the upper body strength of a wet noodle

\- Back and knee pain were my loyal companions

\- Relationship status with my couch: ""It's complicated""



The Journey:

Started at rock bottom, but plot twist - turns out that's a great foundation to build on!

What Worked (and What Didn't):

1. Diet Adventures:

\- Tried everything from keto to carnivore (basically played Diet Roulette)

\- Found out that counting calories is like adulting 

\- nobody wants to do it, but it works- Used Cronometer (free) to track everything that went into my face-hole

2. Supplement Reality Check:

\- Tried 10-15 fat burners (spoiler alert: save your money)- Actually useful stuff:

\- Protein powder (your new best friend)

\- Creatine

\- Coffee or ECA Stack (research before you start using)

3. Lifestyle Changes:

\- Quit alcohol (my liver wrote me a thank you note)

\- Started cooking my own meals

\- Stopped eating out so much (my wallet and waistline high-fived)



Lifting Stats (From Zero to... Well, Not Zero):

\- Started: Couldn't lift Shit

\- Now:

\- Bench: 150lb

\- Squat: 125lb

\- Deadlift: 175lb

\- Can see my abs (well, the top 4... on a good day... with perfect lighting... if I squint)



Pro Tips From a Former Couch Potato:

1. The first 1-2 months suck. Like, really suck. But so did high school, and we survived that!
2. Get a gym buddy who's in better shape - nothing motivates like shame (kidding... kind of)
3. It's okay to have cheat days (I celebrated every 10lbs lost by eating like a medieval king)
4. Water weight after cheat days isn't fat - it's just your body being dramatic

The Real Talk:

Consistency beats perfection every time. You don't need fancy diets or magic pills. Just eat less, move more, and remember why you started. Each day you stick to it is another day you're lapping everyone on the couch!

I don't have a printer, all the FedEx's in the entire Bay Area were closed, the public libraries were closed, I couldn't access anything on any college campus as I'm not a student, and I work from home, so I didn't have an office to go print from.   And everything opened too late the next day to make it to the exam on time.

I was about to go for my last resort--buying an entire printer from Office Depot (which was also closed), but I finally found something random--a printing kiosk at a place called Victory Point Cafe.  So I went there, and they had a printer in a back corner by the bathroom that you could download files to and print them out.

So VPC deserves a shoutout because, one, they saved me from not being able to get to the exam center on time.  And two, it's a pretty cool place with a very social atmosphere.  They serve coffee and whatnot, but it's also a board game cafe. There are games all over and people come to play with people they know and people they don't.  So if you happen to be celebrating this week and enjoy that kind of thing, maybe check it out with some friends.",1,1731131604.0,CABarExam,0,1.0,False

1gn3dmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1gn3dmm/lost_at_31/,Lost at 31,"I (31M) have had a terrible time since graduating from university in 2016. I keep finding dead end/low paying roles, mostly due to squandering my education on an absolutely worthless degree. I have no friends in the city I currently live in. I'm stuck in a relationship that hasn't been romantic for 3 years. I've gained 65lbs in 4 years and cannot get it off, even though I've been working out and watching my diet. 

I had a decent job for two years in property management, but it was very high stress and required lots of overtime. I was laid off last Christmas and received an insulting severance package. The money went quickly and I drained my savings and maxed out 4 credit cards trying to live until something came along. I got a new job in July, and I work at a startup as a customer service rep. It's not horrible, but the ability to move up is very limited and the pay is significantly lower than other jobs similar to mine. I don't feel any pride or joy around it. 

During my unemployment period, I tried to launch a small home decor shop in a local boutique. I was excited to have some funds coming in, and really was passionate about my products. However, it ended up tanking and I was forced to sell off the business. Due to my circumstances, I've had to file bankruptcy. I am humiliated and ashamed. Who at 31 files bankruptcy?! 

I've tried to return to school for a graduate degree (MBA or PhD) for 3 years now. Every year, I am rejected by all schools. It's hard because I graduated top of my class in undergrad and had numerous honors and awards. Yet my life experience and education has not been enough for a school to give me a chance. I've applied to some programs again this year, but I'm afraid I will face the same decision.

My partner (34M) and I are not a good match. We've lived together for nearly 4 years, and we have rarely gotten along. We are very different people, and we both talk about leaving. The problem is we are financially bound and stuck in our lease. We barely scrape by on bills and neither of us have a savings or retirement built up. We are just surviving. It's lonely to only see someone in your house as an acquaintance at best. We've only been intimate about 8 times in the 4 years together. I miss intimacy. I miss love. I miss who I was before him. As you may be able to tell by my username, I am OBSESSED with Christmas. I dream about it year-round. I crave snow. And I love Hallmark Christmas movies. I dream of finding my little pocket hubby who also loves Christmas as much as me one day.

Before I was in a relationship, I was very fit and handsome. I had men chasing me, buying me drinks, trying to date me. But I didn't want to settle down yet, and was happy living at the gym. But when I met my partner and the pandemic hit, we moved too fast and began living together and quit being active. Survival mode kicked in, and I got too comfortable. The weight gain has completely destroyed my confidence. I feel disgusting. I've quit taking any photos of myself and don't like to be in others' photos. I don't smile anymore. No matter what I do, I am stuck with at my current weight. 

My best friend (31F) and her wife (40F) moved from Denver (where I live) to Rochester, NY 2 years ago. They used a portion of their inheritance to buy a gorgeous home, and now they work at a little coffee shop. They're so happy there. It's my dream to move there and be with them and finally buy a house. But, as you can imagine, I am now ineligible to buy a home for at least 2 years due to the bankruptcy. Also the fact of being dead broke. I still am aiming to move in July 2025, but I just don't know how.

I have been so lost in life. It feels like, since I chose the ""wrong major"", that my entire life will never be what I hoped. I see people my age buying homes, getting married, making large salaries and getting promotions. And I am jealous. I'm not proud of that, but I am. I know people will say, ""You're still so young, you'll get there!"" But it doesn't feel like it. I went from this high achieving young adult to a fat loser destined to be nothing. 

I need advice on how to find my drive and spark again. How do I go about being happy in life? How do I move forward when I have completely set myself back? Can life ever get better, or is this all I have to look forward to? ",1,1731131311.0,findapath,3,1.0,False

I stopped working when my 3rd trimester started so that’s about 5 months of not contributing to our finances. I do not receive paid maternity leave or any benefits (worked as a waitress). My husband and I are absolutely broke, as in we’ve overdrawn our account a few times and our credit cards are maxed out. He works a remote 9-5 job making good money, but our rent and car payment is really expensive (over 1/2 his monthly salary). I do not spend any money on myself unless you count groceries and an almost daily coffee from dunkin (never my idea and sometimes I forego one to save $). I don’t buy anything for myself, I cut my own hair, I cook all our meals, I clean our home and I take care of our daughter who I breastfeed %100. He spends a lot of money on crypto and I’m not allowed to say anything about it because “it’s HIS money”. Every time the account gets low he yells at me for not working or having a job that would give me paid maternity leave and calls me lazy. I’ll tell him we wouldn’t be down to our last penny if he wouldn’t spend hundreds of dollars every week hoping to make it back in crypto. This week I attempted to pick up some shifts but he couldnt handle our daughter on his own so he admitted I shouldn’t go back to work, so I tell my boss I can’t continue. Yet here I am, it’s the middle of the night and I’m getting some sleep (RARE) and he storms in with an attitude about how we have no money again and it’s ALL my fault. There’s $30 in our account and he says he’s going to McDonalds and buying ZYNs and he doesn’t care. 
He is right about one thing, I DO NOT want to go back to work right now and I really don’t see how I can. But I understand this economy is insanely bad and I know both parents are working in most households so AITA?

1gn38t1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard2/comments/1gn38t1/imagine_better_than_the_best_you_know/,“Imagine better than the best you know”,"This is one of my favorite quotes by Neville! Today was such a great day and the biggest I smiled for hours and hours… one because we are breathing and living, but two because I had a excellent bill of health from the dentist!

Now for context, I had been trying to find that perfect dentist the one that speaks the language I speak! I have moved a few times and I love my teeth so much and would not entrust my teeth to just anyone!

Assumption & Expectation
I had been wanting to see a dentist for a while but still hadn’t found the one… meanwhile I had been doing revision on anything I was concerned about, flossing and brushing daily (which I am extremely diligent about unless I was too tired and fell asleep one day), and also listening to regenerative frequencies (where my assumption here helps me stay in the awareness of what I desire). I had been a bit nervous because I had been so busy and this was the longest I went without seeing a dentist. 

I finally stumbled across some reviews of a dentist I felt would be right. And sure enough he was! Before the visit and during the visit, I imagined the dentist saying “your teeth are great” and expressing that he was shocked that I had waited as long as I had for my cleaning because my teeth looked great! This played out exactly! He was knowledgeable and spent over an hour talking to me and answering my questions- but I also carried the assumption that he would be great and that I am supported wherever I am.

Even during the x-rays, I was expressing my love and gratitude to every single tooth (something I have made a habit this past year and for as many organs and systems and parts of my body as I can). Our cells hear us, and that is why what you say to yourself and the people around you say matter!

Inner conversation, SAT, Revision
While I am diligent about my oral hygiene, I still had areas of concern. Various days I watched videos on tooth anatomy and gum structure and then would even say thank you to my strong healthy gums/gum ligaments/ surface names of the architecture of various teeth. You don’t have to be this specific, but the way my mind works, I like to be specific. At night I would get into a relaxed state and sometimes during the day too, and just imagine my most ideal smile. For revision, I would just mentally go to the areas of concern and fortify those areas. I even revised previous dental visits with another dentist that those were perfect visits too! I have always had a beautiful healthy smile!

I had inner conversations before entering the office and while I was in the office, I was imagining that I would be telling my loved ones that “the dentist said I had no cavities and my teeth were excellent”. This happened! The dental assistant also asked me if I whiten my teeth because they looked so nice and in a previous post I have spoken that I drink more coffee than anyone I know and I hold the assumption that I have strong healthy radiant white teeth! I haven’t used a whitening strip in over two years! And I drank coffee right before my dentist visit! 

These bodies we live in are remarkable. Imagination of your desire and just the very best outcome has profound effects! FAITH people, and even if you feel you don’t have faith… if you can take five minutes to imagine the ideal scene or hear the ideal conversation in your head- then that my friend is acting in accordance with faith because you are exercising the idea it can happen!

On Wednesday, she “rejected” me and said she’s not romantically available and was only interested as friends. It put me in a tailspin and made me extremely anxious, but I meditated and came back down to earth that same night. 

While out for a walk and feeling at peace, I ask the universe for a coworker to give me candy and for another coworker to buy me coffee the next day. Thursday comes and guess what? Big ass bowl of candy on the front desk as soon as I walk in the building. 2 hours later, a co worker offers to pour me a cup of coffee (she’s never done this before and I’ve been working with her for 1.5 years) and another coworker offered to buy me Starbucks a minute later. 

I feel great and go for a walk later that night and ask the universe for my SP to text me the next day (Friday). I get home from walk and 20 fucking minutes later I get a text from SP. I have  NEVER received a text from SP before outside of work hours. NEVER! absolutely crazy how I went from nervous anxious wreck from being “rejected” to free candy, coffee, and a text from SP all within a day. SHIT WORKS",2,1731130110.0,lawofattraction,4,1.0,False

However, if the cat spent time in cryosleep with the crew, that means that someone on the crew cares for the cat. 

When the crew first was awakened from cryosleep they all went to the ""kitchen"", for a smoke or coffee or whatever. Not a single person mentioned the cat, nor did we see the cat eating.

I met this girl at a sort of workplace environment and we hit it off pretty early on.  We exchanged numbers and snaps, a few weeks of texting and out of the blue she one day asks me to get coffee with her.  I do this, we have a good time.  Since then we've been stuck to each other, we text all the time, at our work we're always together, I've treated her to dinner, I've had her stay the night at my place a few times, we would give each other back/neck massages, we even slept in the same bed once.  I even drove her two hours for a work trip so we had a bit of a roadtrip together.  

After all this the other week she calls me up all depressed and she reveals that she broke up with a guy she was dating.  Apparently she started dating this guy shortly after hanging out with me and never once told me about him.  This dude was really awful to her, he made her drive five hours to go see him just to dump her as a joke.  And she called me to vent about this.  My immediate reaction was questioning why she never told me that she had a boyfriend while we were doing all this stuff together and she reveals that she never saw me like that and only saw me as a friend which just boggled my mind.  I told her multiple times how much I liked her and she said she thought I was joking every single time.  And things got a little heated.  She said she didn't like my personality and I had to mention how she chose a guy who literally stranded her five hours from her home over me and this really pissed her off.  She said I was implying that she makes bad decisions and that she didn't realize the guy was like that.  After this she cut contact, blocked me on my phone and on Snap.  I've honestly been pondering this whole situation and I genuinely can't tell if I screwed up or not.  I'm even thinking of apologizing for ruining the friendship but my buddies tell me I did nothing wrong.  Was wondering what you guys think?",1,1731129600.0,AmItheAsshole,12,1.0,False

I wrote down my grievances about my housemates to self vent (there's a lot). One particular thing that has occurred is my female housemate having almost obsessively trying to drink my drinks, including when I was actively drinking one (FYI this is softdrinks and juice) e.g if I bought drinks she was always trying to 'have a sip', she would take my drinks and while pouring a glass would say 'hope you don't mind', or act like a crackhead looking for her next hit where she would have to try or open my new drinks, the worst one was when I had a Fanta I got from like McDonald's and she waited for me to put it down to start drinking it, then wanted to hold it to keep drinking it. I told her to stop drinking my drinks and I find it weird she does it everytime she sees me have drinks or drinking a drink. She pretended to be fine with it but she was visibly upset and claimed it was ""normal"" for her. Yet I should be able to peacefully drink a drink without my housemate trying to suck on the rim or straw of whatever I'm drinking. She also claimed telling her that I don't like her doing things feels like a personal attack.

Then I caught her sucking off my toothpaste one day saying she ""accidently"" thought it was hers despite us having a different type including tube shape. She's always ""accidently"" doing things then gets highly defensive when you tell her to stop. There's plenty of times she wanted to eat the food I was eating but also using the same fork or spoon.

Though it's the mouth to mouth type of stuff that makes no sense. I can't understand why she wants her mouth to things I put my mouth to. Whenever used to share drinks or food or toothpaste with another person it would be with like a child relative of mine e.g Idc if my little niece or cousin drank some of my drink or ate some food I was eating or if I was dating someone I would share food and drinks with them. Even then my child relatives or boyfriend at the time wouldn't be so obsessive and demanding of my stuff. If I said no to my niece she wouldn't go suck off my tooth paste when she thought I wasn't watching and my ex wouldn't offer to hold my ice coffee just so he could start drinking it.

Edit: I will add this housemate also tries to steal my clothes and constant little things are going missing of mine e.g sprays, tape I was using to pack boxes, etc. If catch her out she's like ""it was an accident"".

1gn2xdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifechanyuanCommunity/comments/1gn2xdc/consciousness_determines_existence_by_xuefeng/,"Consciousness Determines Existence, by Xuefeng","Whether existence determines consciousness, or consciousness determines existence is a type of watershed between materialism and idealism. Human beings have not yet had a correct understanding of this issue until now.

 

Jumping to a conclusion rashly will definitely cause confusion in people's minds. If we divide the population into five categories: ignorant people, Laities, mortals, sages, and saints (immortals), and then according to the attitudes of people of each level towards the material world, we can clearly understand the reason why some people believe that existence determines consciousness, while others are convinced that consciousness determines existence.

 

1. Ignorant people live by instinct

 

Although they belong to the family of human beings, they are not much different from animals. They don’t know what creation and thinking are. As long as things are necessary for their survival, they will just grab them. If they are put on a deserted island, they will only die. So, for ignorant people, existence determines everything, without existence, there is nothing.

 

2. Laities are people who live by their desires

 

The central content of their lives is money, status, power, reputation, and beauty. They live for these desires all their lives. Once they don't get the above, they will suffer terribly. For laities, existence determines their consciousness, and their daily activities have a clear purpose and goal, which is how to obtain existence. Without the ""seduction"" of factors such as money, laities cannot live a single day.

 

3. Mortals live by affection

 

The core content of their lives is family affection, relatives and friends, colleagues and classmates, group and clan, country and nation. With these, they can live a flavorful life. Without these, they will feel alone, bored, empty, and lonely. Therefore, for mortals, it is still existence that determines consciousness, and without existence, their consciousness will collapse.

 

4. Sages are people who live by reason

 

They are people who often ask why, people who want to understand the essence behind superficial phenomena (existence). Existence is the basis of sages' consciousness, without this basis, they cannot think deeply, people such as scientists in various fields, philosophers, and thinkers all belong to the category of sages. Although existence is the basis of the consciousness of sages, they also pay more attention to the reaction of consciousness to existence. Therefore, for sages, existence and consciousness are equally important. Because they devote more time and energy to the field of consciousness than on the basis of existence, sages tend to become the best among human beings.

 

5. Saints (Immortals) are people who rely on spirituality.

 

What is perceived through sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch is not important to them, what is important is what is realized through their spiritual sense. Spiritual perception is purely an activity of consciousness, so, for immortals, it is consciousness that determines existence.

 

To sum it up, for ignorant people, laities, and mortals, existence determines consciousness. If you tell them, consciousness determines existence, it is like casting pearls before swine, they might even give you a back kick. For sages, existence is equivalent to consciousness, there is no question of who decides what; for immortals, consciousness determines existence, if we tell immortals that existence determines consciousness, they can only think that we are ignorant.

 

Then, does existence determine consciousness, or does consciousness determine existence?

 

First, let's take a look at all the things created by human beings. Like cars, how did cars appear on earth? There are no cars on the earth so how could cars appear out of thin air?

 

What! It turns out that people first imagined it in their consciousness, and then created it according to the imagination in their consciousness.

 

How did the first house appear on the earth? What! It is also people who first imagined a house structure, and then recreated it according to the imagined structure.

 

How did fashion become popular? What! It turns out that fashion designers first realized it in their brains, and then made it to guide the trend.

 

It can be deduced from this that all things created by human beings are firstly imagined in human consciousness, and then created according to their imaginations. If people had no imagination, that is, no thinking and no consciousness, then all the artificial objects that we use today would not have appeared. This clearly proves that consciousness determines existence. Without human consciousness, how can there be so many artificial things on the earth?

 

Let's look at the dwelling places of human beings and the natural environment. When we enter someone’s home, someone who loves to be clean and tidy, we see that the tables, chairs and beds are arranged in an orderly manner. Whether it is the pictures on the wall, or the flowers cultivated on the windowsill, they all give people the feeling of being natural, harmonious, beautiful, and suitable. Why is this happening? Oh! It turns out that the owner of this house has a clear spatial layout in her consciousness. The orderly existence of everything in her house was first imagined in her consciousness. If her consciousness is chaotic, she may put the coffee table on the table, and she can't think of planting a few pots of flowers and placing them on the windowsill.

 

Over the past ten years, I have observed the residences of many people in Zimbabwe. Generally, the living environment of Caucasians is clean, tidy, and orderly. Their lawns are always neatly mowed, their flowers are always beautiful, and plants are always verdant and green. Even their washrooms (toilets) are full of flowers, and you will never spot oil stains in their kitchens. Looking at the environment of our Chinese people, weeds are overgrown in the courtyard, dog excrement is everywhere, the washroom smells bad, cockroaches are rampant in the kitchen, and the stove is greasy...

 

Why is there such a big difference? Aren't they all human? It turns out that the difference lies not in existence, but in consciousness. Chinese and Caucasians have different consciousness of the environment. The quality of the living environment depends on the consciousness of the people in this environment. If there is a good consciousness, there will be a good environment. Without a good consciousness, of course it is impossible to have a good environment for existence.

 

My child once used his vacation to drive to Washington and New York by himself. I asked him on the phone: ""What is your biggest impression after seeing New York?"" Unexpectedly, he replied: ""New York's Chinatown is too dirty and messy. It does not match the civilization and prosperity of New York.""

 

Can it be that existence determines consciousness? If a Chinese has lived in China from beginning to end, it can be barely said that the existence of the dirty, disorderly, and bad surrounding environment leads to the dirty, disorderly and bad living environment of his own. But after we came to a beautiful country, where the existence is beautiful, why does the environment change when we live there? Isn't it that our consciousness determines our existence? Suppose we Chinese exchange with Japanese and Germans, we all live in Japan and Germany and let Japanese and Germans live in China. Within 50 years, China will become the most beautiful and graceful country in the world, while Japan and Germany will become two dirty, disorderly, and bad countries.

 

Consciousness determines existence, and what kind of consciousness is there, there will be that kind of existence. If everyone is belligerent, the world will be in a constant state war. If everyone loves peace, how could there be wars?

 

Consciousness determines existence. Look at Islamic mosques, Christian churches, and Buddhist temples. Their architectural styles and shapes are quite different. Why? Because the consciousness of designers and builders is different from each other.

 

Consciousness determines existence. When comparing the urban layouts of Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, and Beijing, the capital of China, Harare’s commercial, industrial, and residential areas are clearly separated, with a distance of at least one kilometer from each other, while Beijing’s commercial, residential, and industrial areas are almost intertwined. The reason for the formation of this pattern of existence is that the British and the Chinese have different consciousness of people, and it is the different consciousness that determines the different urban layouts.

 

Consciousness determines existence. When comparing the wearing and the style of dress of women during the Chinese Cultural Revolution and the wearing and style of dress of people at this present stage, from the perspective of time and space, they are definitely two different worlds. During the Cultural Revolution, women did not bother to perm, dye their hair, draw their eyebrows, and put on lipstick. Even their clothes were mostly yellow, gray, and blue. Skirts and high-heeled shoes were absolutely not allowed. About their breasts, they would find ways to press them tightly to their chest. If you budged a little, people would look at you differently, and you would be regarded as ""a hot foxy spirit descending on the world"", a symbol of restlessness and flirting. Look at today's women, one by one, they are more enchanting and beautiful, with all kinds of postures, styles, curvaceous beauty, sexual beauty, and temperamental beauty that is fully displayed, living out their individuality, freedom, and elegance, as if all the fairies in heaven have descended to the world. The reason why different eras have different ways of dressing is that people in different eras have different consciousness, and it is the consciousness of different eras that determines the existence of those different eras.

 

Consciousness determines existence. Why is the population of the United States growing more slowly than that of China and India? Why do couples with higher IQs, who are richer, and with higher education levels have fewer children, while poorer, less-educated couples have more children? Why can a man have several wives in some countries and regions, while most countries and regions can only be monogamous? Why could a couple in our previous generation have many children, but we can only have one child at this stage of China? Aren’t all these differences determined by our human consciousness?

 

Consciousness determines existence. Why are most of the Nobel Prize winners Americans? Why is there not a single Nobel Prize winner from mainland China? Are Americans so smart and Chinese so stupid? The main reason is that Americans and Chinese have different consciousness. If you want to eat hamburgers, you will definitely not make noodles; if you want to eat chicken, you definitely won’t put pork into the pot. The reason is so simple, do we still doubt that consciousness determines existence?

 

Consciousness determines existence. Why do the political systems of various countries in the world differ from each other? Why does the president of the United States only serve two terms at most, while the presidents of some countries can serve many terms? Isn't it their existence determined by the national consciousness of various countries?

 

How was the earth born? How did the plants and animals on earth appear? Isn't this determined by the consciousness of the Greatest Creator?

 

Not long ago, I read a review article, its general meaning is to criticize the only children in China at this stage for being ambitious, unrealistic, greedy for enjoyment, and for their wishful thinking. The article also mentioned a college student who had not yet graduated describing his long-term plan: ""I want to go to the United States and build a villa in a small city with beautiful mountains and rivers. I want to have a green lawn, a private swimming pool, and a Mercedes-Benz."" The reviewer had a good-natured ridicule on this “wishful thinking” and hoped that such college students can face reality, be down-to-earth, and not be too ambitious.

 

In my opinion, this commenter is an outstanding representative of the idea that existence determines consciousness. His thinking is still in the narrow field of material existence. He only sees today, values reality, and he cannot imagine that the future of mankind is determined by the consciousness of mankind, that the future of each individual is determined by the consciousness of the individual. This kind of person is a frog at the bottom of a well, and the blue sky he sees is just as big as a sieve. Relying on this kind of person to guide young people is not only misleading young people, but also cruelly oppressing people’s spirituality and ruining their bright future. Such people, on the surface, are kind, but in essence, are evil.

 

If I were to comment on this college student, I would say, ""Son, you're absolutely right. Visualize it, your wish will come true. The better and clearer the picture you have of your future in your mind, the more likely you are to realize it. The place you can see is where you are going, the situation you can realize in your brain is where you can go, because your behavior is controlled by your consciousness. If you want to go to the east, your feet can't move toward the west. The existence of reality is constantly changing with the consciousness of human beings. If we limit our consciousness to the existence of reality, we will always be slaves to the existence of reality, and we will never be able to create a better tomorrow. Son, the universe is boundless, there are 36 dimensional spaces, so spread the wings of your imagination and fly freely, a bright future belongs to the generation that can imagine this.”

 

Whether existence determines consciousness, or consciousness determines existence, it is by no means a game of words or concepts, and it is by no means a question of whether to eat steamed buns or noodles. Whoever comes first directly determines the future of everyone. What kind of consciousness one has, he will have that kind of life; what kind of consciousness determines what kind of existence he will have.

 

Existence determines consciousness is the thinking of animals and plants that rely on instinct to survive. Consciousness determines existence is the thinking of sages and saints, and the thinking of gods and Buddhas. If existence determines consciousness, we have only one earth; if consciousness determines existence, we will have 36 dimensional spaces.

 

If existence determines consciousness, we can only survive in the contradictions and pains of reality forever. If consciousness determines existence, we can transcend the existence of reality and focus on future development and changes; if existence determines consciousness, we can only passively be constrained by the environment; if consciousness determines existence, we can actively open up a ""sunshine avenue"" in the existence of reality; if existence determines consciousness, we cannot see the brilliance of the Greatest Creator, and we can only live to die; if consciousness determines existence, we can decipher the mysteries of the time and space of the universe, extend this limited life to the infinite wonderful time and space, and then we can die to be reborn.""

 

Existence determines consciousness is conventional thinking, consciousness determines existence is unconventional thinking, and a bright future belongs to people with unconventional thinking.

I (23M) met my best friend (23M) when we entered college on 2019. We met each other through friends in common and I remember he was a little shy and a very quiet guy in general. We didn't get to know each other very well at first because we only took like 2 classes together, but I thought he was a very intelligent nice guy and maybe a little cute lol but nothing more.

I know it is wrong but I assumed he was gay (no reason why, just my gaydar literally), so I started talking to him more and more and eventually he came out to me. I wasn't surprised but I was happy to see him experience new things and eventually he met his current boyfriend. Fast-forward the pandemic came and that is the time when we got really close to each other talking on FaceTime, watching movies on zoom, playing online games or purely messages. He always helped me with homework or any important project.

Once we graduated I left the city for work, so I only could be in our city on weekends, and I started to spend every weekend with him for like 6 months straight. The thing is, he started a new job (june 2024) in which it offices are out of the state (like a 6 hour drive from our city), and he told me that his boss eventually would need him to work presenially, so he worked like 3 months remotely. That's when we started to see each other almost every single day, going to the gym, working together (I also had a remote job), grab drinks, coffee, even going to get my car checked at the auto repair.

Since the day he told me he would have to leave, I started feeling weird, like I was losing something, like a part of me dying, I don't know how to explain it. When he left the city and said goodbye to me, I couldn't stop crying as I was hugging him. Feeling that way shocked me because no one else made me feel that way on a goodbye situation. Not even my own family.

At first I thought I was just emotionally dependent on him, but after meditating it, I just can't deny it anymore. I love him, I'm so in love with him and I love everything about him, I dare say I could marry him... when I see his face I just can't stop thinking about kissing him and hugging him so hard. No one else has ever made me feel more safe, heard, cared about, and mostly loved.

I'm not exactly planning to tell him my feelings because I know he doesn't feel the same for me, also he is generally into older guys (like 35+), he is taken rn, and also, and i don't know if this is a bad idea, we planned since college to be roommates and work at the same place. It looks like that time is getting closer (I already had an interview with his boss).

I also feel kinda bad because I know his bf and he is such a nice person, however my friend once told me that he probably won't marry him because of the age difference, and I notice he is sometimes questioning himself what is going to happen with their relationship (his bf is from our city and now it is a long-distance relationship).

I don't know what to do with all this situation, I just feel like every day I'm more in love with him but i don't wanna do something stupid that could ruin our friendship. I just want him to be happy even if I'm not the reason, but these feelings are so strong I'm scared.",2,1731129563.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1gn2va2,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1gn2va2/how_long_does_the_removal_of_jaw_bone_fragments/,How long does the removal of jaw bone fragments take? And how high are the chances that antibiotics work to heal instead of needing surgery? ,"Hi there, It’s been 3 months since i’ve gotten my wisdom teeth removed and I now have pain in my lower left jaw. I’ve been to the dentist today and was given antibiotics but there’s a chance I might need surgery again to remove some bone fragments and I’m feeling quite nervous and upset. I am a university student who lives out of home and in an expensive city. When I got my wisdom teeth removed I had to pay $1200 for an anaesthesiologist and I don’t have the money saved to pay for that again. 

Would anyone have any idea how long a surgery would take to remove some jaw bone fragments? And is there a percentage on how often antibiotics work to fix an issue like this? 

I am also upset as my dentist has told me to cut back on sugar but I have the biggest sweet tooth, It’s so hard for me to fight the cravings on sugary things like syrup in my coffee and chocolate for dessert but I have to so I don’t get more cavities. Wish me luck. ",1,1731129362.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

Here's my journey to a whopping 5 downloads:

# The Game

* Get letters
* Make words related to a theme
* Use each letter once
* Question your vocabulary
* Regret your life choices

# Development Highlights

* Spent 7 days coding with AI
* Burned through 43 coffee cups
* Had several existential crises
* Made an icon in Midjourney at 3 AM (and yes, it shows)
* Released it before I could overthink and abandon it (again)

# Current Stats

* Downloads: 5
* Active Users: 3
* Me
* Also me (testing on different devices)
* My mom (bless her heart)
* Revenue: Can almost afford a coffee
* Bug reports: Just my mom asking how to open the app

# Why You Might Like It

* Absolutely NO ADS (because I respect myself)
* No predatory monetization (I don't know how to implement it anyway)
* Clean, minimal UI (because I can't design complex ones)
* Gets progressively harder (my mom is my difficulty curve tester)

Would love if you could try it out! My mom needs someone to compete with, and I need validation from strangers on the internet.

The game is called Devil's Words. It's available on App Store.

1gn2tq9,https://i.redd.it/5cr8tpnw7tzd1.jpeg,Can I use the same motion design ad across multiple platforms?,"Wait…Can I Put This Ad EVERYWHERE?""
You’ve just poured heart, soul, and at least 37 coffee breaks into a stunning motion design ad for your product. It’s popping off on Instagram, drawing in likes faster than you can say “engagement.” But here’s the million-dollar question: Can this shiny ad just stroll over to Facebook, TikTok, and your website too? Spoiler alert: Yes…with a few tweaks. Let’s break it down!


---

""Adventures of a 3D Animation—From TikTok to LinkedIn""
Picture this: your sleek 3D animation is bouncing around on TikTok, keeping up with the kids and racking up views like crazy. But then you upload it to LinkedIn, and suddenly it’s that one person at the party who didn’t get the memo on dress code. Each platform has its vibe, and adapting your ad for each audience is like dressing it up for different occasions—just make sure you bring the right outfit!


---

""Less is More…Except When It’s Not""
Here’s the beauty of motion design: it’s flexible! But that TikTok ad where everything’s flying by in 15 seconds? It might need a breather for Facebook, where audiences want a little more meat on the bones. Trim for TikTok, expand for YouTube, and make sure each version plays to the strengths of its new home. Your ad is versatile, but it still deserves a bit of a makeover for each debut.


---

""Sound Check! Each Platform, Different Beat""
Have you ever watched a video on mute? That’s TikTok on a Friday afternoon. For some platforms, your audio might need a toned-down approach, while on others—like YouTube or Instagram—it’s part of the magic! Adjust that soundtrack like you would for karaoke night: pick a version everyone can sing along to, or at least tolerate!


---

""Engagement, Reach, and That Sweet, Sweet ROI""
Why go through all this trouble? Easy—platform-optimized ads get better results. You’re boosting engagement, expanding reach, and yes, bumping up that sweet, sweet ROI. Plus, viewers love it when your content feels tailor-made. They’re far more likely to click, share, and buy if you’ve gone the extra mile to suit each space they’re scrolling through.


---

Closing Punchline: ""So, Can One Ad Really Rule Them All?""
Not quite! Your ad might not stay exactly the same everywhere, but it can dominate across platforms if it’s adaptable. Consider it like a well-traveled suit—switching ties for each event, fitting in perfectly every time. So go on, show that ad a world tour…one platform at a time!

1gn2sqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gn2sqa/the_ultimate_guide_to_choosing_the_perfect/,The Ultimate Guide to Choosing the Perfect Pendant Light for Every Room,"Pendant lights can elevate any space, blending function with design to create a unique ambiance. Whether you're looking to add a stylish focal point to your kitchen, bring warmth to your living room, or enhance your dining area, pendant lights are an ideal choice. In this ultimate guide, we'll walk you through selecting the perfect pendant light for every room in your home, with tips on style, size, placement, and lighting effects.

**1. Understanding the Basics of Pendant Lights**

Before diving into specific rooms, it’s essential to understand the basics. Pendant lights, also known as [hanging lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), are suspended from the ceiling by a rod, chain, or cord. They come in a variety of styles, from sleek and minimalistic designs to intricate and ornate options, allowing them to complement almost any decor. Pendant lights are perfect for task lighting and can also provide ambient lighting to make your room feel warm and inviting.

**2. Choosing Pendant Lights for the Kitchen**

The kitchen is one of the most popular rooms to incorporate pendant lights, as they provide both functional and aesthetic benefits. Here’s how to choose the best [hanging lights for kitchen](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights):

**Consider Placement**

Place pendant lights over kitchen islands, countertops, or dining nooks to create focused task lighting. The placement should illuminate work areas, making food prep safer and easier.

**Focus on Style and Finish** 

Match your pendant lights with your kitchen’s design style. For modern kitchens, opt for sleek, metallic finishes. For rustic or farmhouse-inspired kitchens, consider pendant lights with a warm, natural material like wood or wicker.

**Size and Spacing**

A good rule is to space pendant lights about 24 to 30 inches apart when installing multiple fixtures. For larger islands, you may want to use oversized pendant lights, whereas smaller kitchens might require smaller, more compact options to avoid overwhelming the space.

**3. Pendant Lights for the Living Room**

When it comes to choosing [hanging lights for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), think about ambiance and design. Living rooms are all about comfort and style, so the pendant lights you choose should reflect that.

**Statement Piece or Minimalist?**

If your living room has a focal point—like a beautiful coffee table, a central seating arrangement, or a fireplace—consider hanging a statement pendant light above it to draw attention. Conversely, for a more relaxed vibe, choose a minimalist pendant that adds soft illumination without taking center stage.

**Layered Lighting**

Pendant lights in the living room are best used in combination with other light sources, like floor lamps, wall sconces, or ceiling lights. This layered approach adds depth to the room, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere.

**Height Matters**

Consider the ceiling height in your living room when selecting your pendant light. For standard 8-foot ceilings, a shorter drop is recommended to avoid interrupting sightlines. Higher ceilings, on the other hand, allow for more elongated pendants.

**4. Bedroom Pendant Lights**

In bedrooms, pendant lights can serve as bedside lamps, freeing up space on nightstands. These hanging lights create a luxurious look and provide practical task lighting for reading or relaxing in bed.

**Choose Soft, Warm Lighting**

To foster a calming environment, select bulbs with a warm color temperature (around 2700K) that produce a gentle glow. Frosted glass shades or fabric-covered pendants are excellent choices for diffusing light softly throughout the room.

**Place Pendants Symmetrically**

For a balanced look, hang a pendant light on either side of the bed. Ensure the lights are at a height that’s easy to reach for switching on and off, typically between 20-30 inches above the nightstand.

**5. Dining Room Pendant Lights**

Dining rooms are a fantastic space to make a statement with hanging lights. A pendant light over the dining table not only provides task lighting but also sets the mood for meals.

**Center Above the Table**

A single, centered pendant light works beautifully over round tables, while multiple pendants in a row can enhance the look of a rectangular or longer table. Aim to hang the light around 30-36 inches above the table to provide enough light for dining without obstructing views across the table.

**Dimmer Switches are Essential**

For added versatility, install a dimmer switch. This allows you to adjust the lighting for different occasions, from bright light for family meals to a softer glow for more intimate dinners.

**6. Bathroom Pendant Lights**

Bathrooms are often overlooked when it comes to decorative lighting. Pendant lights can bring a stylish touch to this functional space, particularly above the vanity.

**Opt for Damp-Rated Fixtures**

Since bathrooms can be humid, select pendant lights that are damp-rated for safe use in moisture-prone areas. Look for fixtures made from materials resistant to rust and corrosion, such as glass or coated metals.

**Functional and Stylish**

Hanging lights in the bathroom should be positioned to provide ample light for daily tasks like shaving or applying makeup. Consider placing pendants at eye level on either side of the mirror to avoid shadows.

 **7. Entryway Pendant Lights**

The entryway is the first impression of your home, so why not make it memorable with a stunning pendant light? This is your chance to create a welcoming, stylish statement as soon as guests walk in.

**Choose a Statement Design** 

For an entryway, go bold with your choice. Whether it’s a large chandelier-style pendant or an intricately designed lantern, this piece should set the tone for your home’s aesthetic.

**Balance the Scale**

If your entryway has a high ceiling, you can choose a larger, more dramatic pendant light. For smaller spaces, opt for a smaller fixture that complements the proportions of the entryway.

**Final Tips for Choosing Pendant Lights for Every Room**

**Match Fixture Size to Room Size:** A large room can handle a bigger fixture, whereas smaller rooms should stick to more compact designs to avoid overpowering the space.

**Consider the Function of Each Room:** Task-oriented spaces, like kitchens or home offices, benefit from focused, bright lighting, while ambient lighting works best in living rooms and bedrooms.

**Experiment with Styles:** Don’t be afraid to mix materials and textures. Pendant lights come in a wide range of finishes—from brass and bronze to wood and wicker—that can add a unique touch to each room.

Choosing the perfect hanging lights can transform your home. By focusing on the function, size, and style of pendant lights, you can ensure that each room shines in its own way. So whether you're searching for hanging lights for the kitchen or an eye-catching fixture for the living room, let your lighting choices reflect your taste, create the right mood, and enhance your home’s overall ambiance.",1,1731129096.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

How do I get them to pay me back?,"So a fellow batchmate came to town n pinged me. I said we can meet up for a quick coffee, more out of courtesy, as we never were close friends during college. He asked if I can reach out to another batchmate to join, I told him to msg her directly as we are not in touch (this girl used to be my flatmate when we both got our first jobs out of college and we shared an apt for a year, but since I moved to her city couple of years ago and reached out to her she never showed any interest to meet up with me) Anyway connected and decided a place (a pub) and texted me. I went and we all had a drink each and few snacks. Suddenly this girl says its getting late, she needs to leave and could I pick up the tab and she will Gpay me later and not to let our visiting batchmate pay. It was so sudden that I was taken aback and she left. Anyway he and I stayed n finished our snacks and when the bill came, he made no efforts to even offer to chip in. I paid and left and later on msged the girl to Gpay me half the amount and she didnt even respond! I know she wont pay up. She will simply ""forget"".  And we dont meet on a regular basis that it can be next time its on you thingy.  
  
More than the amount, what pisses me off is the way she ""volunteered"" me as the host. And he was the one who called me to meet up !!  
  
Back in my town, I meet up monthly with some other batchmates & we have always gone dutch. It was always an unspoken understanding. I'm just so disgusted.

Maybe being rich its small change for them, but it's the principal of the matter, don't choose the place, not say anything upfront and then hang the noose on me or some other unsuspecting person!!    
  
How can some people mature into this kind of adults? To be frank this is the first time anyone in my batch has behaved like this. And she owns a business!!

Simplify the messaging.

Harris failed to mobilize the critical mass of the working class to her neoliberal campaign for many reasons. However, one reason was that she used language that appealed only to the higher educated, coastal liberals.

We need to amplify leftist populism and political rhetoric.

I don’t mean trying to force feed Marxist dissertations and theories to rural Americans, nor should we be debating workers online about the woes and successes and line struggles of the Soviet Union in 1930 or some foreign country they can’t find on a map.

The American worker just needs to know that their boss and their landlord are fucking them — and in a language they can understand and resonate with. They need to know how to form a labor union. They need to be praised for rolling up their sleeves and becoming working class heroes, not coffee shop book talk academics.

The nuances of the rest will come in time and Revolution.

Organize the union now, essay later.

We have a precedent to step in and offer concrete solutions now before the fascists fill the gap — and they will. Whatever theoretical  differences your fragmented socialist organization has with another needs to be put aside.

I heard great things from the Swanson brand but it doesn't stink of sulfur so not sure if that means it isn't as effective. I started with one 600 mg capsule in the morning with coffee and felt mildly aware, calm and less anxious about the future. Next day I took 2 capsules and felt a little more focused and in the moment. When I took 3 capsules the next morning, I started feeling pressure in my chest even after drinking a bottle of water. Eating kind of hurt when it went down my throat and stomache. I figured it was because I also took ibuprofen with it for my stiff neck and back, so I took 4 capsules the next morning (2.4 grams) by itself nothing else. Well the pressure just felt more prominent this time, even after drinking coffee and a bottle of water. Food hurt went it went down my chest. Did I not drink enough water? Also I had a brief moment of nausea/headache/vertigo around 2pm. The kind that doesn't feel good and makes you salivate for some reason. That lasted maybe 2 minutes and then faded. I really want to make the most of NAC and hoping that it may just be cleaning the toxins out of me. I still procrastinate regardless of the increases in dosage. Maybe I need more than 2.4 grams?

1gn23uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CunardCruises/comments/1gn23uf/queen_mary_2_transatlantic_review/,Queen Mary 2 Transatlantic Review,"Hello! 

I wanted to give a review of my week long Transatlantic crossing on the Queen Mary 2 as I have read some very negative reviews from some, not really here but just around the internet in general. As reference I (and my wife as this was part of a belated Honeymoon!) were on the October 25th - Nov 1st crossing in a Britannia Club Balcony Cabin on deck 13. We are also not older, we are in our mid to late 20s and are also not wealthy by any means. We saved up for this honeymoon for a couple years and splurged. I'll break this into a quick intro, sections with good and negative points and finally some closing thoughts. 

As a tl;dr it was an extremely enjoyable crossing with great food, almost amazing service, and good entertainment - we did not find the atmosphere too stuffy at all, even on our two gala nights, solid 9/10.

Boarding the ship in NYC was very speedy, security was very quick to just scan our bags and walk through the metal detector. We did not realize Britannia Club passengers had express boarding, this made moving though incredibly fast, we bypassed some lines and made it onto the ship within 45 minutes of arriving at port. Only hiccup was the lady at the desk taking our little paper we were handed at the start with our deck number on it. The subsequent staff were confused but let us through without issue as it was stamped on our boarding pass as well. There were some engine issues and a passenger was sick and needed to disembark before we left NYC which resulted in us leaving 5.5 hours behind schedule. Not a big issue for us but I am sure it made others a bit anxious.

**Decor and Ship Condition 9.5/10:**

**The Good** 

\-Decor was superb and timeless, it still very much holds up today.

\-Cabin was spacious, well decorated and since our cabins were newer we even had USB at the bed side and a glass shower. It was impeccably clean at boarding with just an older program from the previous crossing stuffed between the desk and wall. Only found this while really looking around, would not expect it to be found during a cleaning.

\-We enjoyed the warmth and comfort the decor provided - certainly made us feel welcomed and like we were home.

\-Ship was very good condition, hardly even any rust on the exterior. A few spots that could use maintenance which I will note below but these were VERY minor.

\-Elevators were extremely fast, plentiful and large and had some lovely art in each.

\-Artwork throughout the ship was beautiful, especially loved the statues outside Illuminations.

\-Was extremely blown away at the gorgeous Commodore Club, also especially enjoyed relaxing in the pretty ConnXions juice/coffee area.

**The Bad (Most of these were nit picks as I was looking to find issues)**

\-We noted the mirrors in most elevators seemed to be discolored and need replacement, unless the ""patterns"" on them were intentional but I doubt it - looked like the reflective surface was breaking down or something. 

\-Noted one elevator had peeling wood veneer at the top. And one other section of the ship also had this, forgot to note where.

\-Felt surfaces on some games tables are in rough condition and could use replacement.

\-Some of the reclining chairs in the planetarium are busted and will lean all the way back if even a bit of pressure is placed on them while sitting. Makes for an uncomfortable experience as you are trying to keep it from going all the way back if someone is behind you lest you crush their knees (all showings were sold out on our voyage so there was always people behind us)

\-Noted the carpeting was peeling off of a stair in both the Royal Court and the main Britannia dining room. A note though, this seemed to have happened during our voyage as we had walked by both areas at the start and they were fine, the tape only appeared in the latter half so it seemed this is already being addressed.

**Food and Drinks 8.5/10:**

**The Good**

\-Lots of variety

\-Very, very, very good quality.

\-Menu was varied each night, typically there was always at least one thing per course we wanted to try from the menu.

\-All baked goods, especially sweets were spectacular. Special shout-out to the chocolate cake and Iced Mocha in the Sir Samuels cafe.

\-Also a special shout out to the Verandah Steak House, probably the best piece of steak I have had the pleasure of eating.

\-Really REALLY enjoyed the scrambled eggs, tasted just like the ones my mom made growing up.

**The Bad**

\-Room service was not great (though at least is complimentary). Ordered a club sandwich one night and the bread was pretty much rock solid. My wife ordered the cheesecake and they said it was not very good, dry and they also forgot the whipped cream on the side. No big deal, just an isolated incident. One night we tried 3 times and could get no answer.

\-One of the evenings in the main dining room there was just absolutely nothing on the menu that seemed appealing. We skipped most courses I ended up with some sort of pork roast that was dry, lacked flavor and honestly was worse than the apple pork roast I get at my local grocery store meat dept. Our table neighbors also did not seem to enjoy the menu. Coincidentally this also happened to be the night we could not get through to room service, perhaps they were overwhelmed. 

**Service 8.5/10:**

**The Good**

\-Staff across the ship were incredibly professional and pleasant, did not encounter anybody that seemed miserable. (I read others mentioning crew seeming miserable was common, perhaps the crew was recently changed out?)

\-Room steward was very on the ball, they had our room fully cleaned every morning and each evening our program was laid out with chocolate, the breakfast in bed order card and any loose clothing nicely folded and placed on the couch for us.

\-Sommelier in the Club restaurant was an absolute joy to be around. We did not order anything from him but he still dropped by our table each night just to say hello, he was always chatting with people or making nice jokes.

\-Head waiter dropped by our table each night to check in with us and was incredibly friendly

\-Had a chat with the lovely barbers, very friendly and professional they did an awesome job.

\-Afternoon Tea crew were an absolute pleasure, very friendly and always making sure we had enough of everything. They were also happy to accommodate bringing a pot of coffee for myself which was nice to see!

**The Bad**

\-One morning later in the voyage the breakfast room service barged into our room over an hour before our selected time, I was still in the process of getting dressed and apparently me yelling ""one minute"" was not heard by them. The person seemed very apologetic but it was a very rude awakening. This only happened once but we did not bother ordering again on the voyage.

\-Different sommelier in the Verandah was not very pleasant, we are not very knowledgeable on wines or champagnes and had brushed our questions off. Was also not really able to provide any suggestions when requested so we just made a guess on what we wanted. Was quite the difference from the Club restaurant sommelier. Disappointing as the Verandah was already an up-charge and we then paid even more for the drinks. (at least the waiter herself was incredibly friendly)

**Activities 9.5/10:**

**The Good**

\-Lots of variety

\-Live music was always top tier

\-Special acts such was the wonderful Tom Franek and Rhythm of the Night was amazing to watch. Absolutely a highlight of the evenings.

\-As a massive Ryan Gosling fan it was quite the nice surprise to see The Fall Guy playing one day.

\-Insights guests were interesting, never thought I'd find Fabergé eggs interesting!

\-Gala nights were fun to attend with great drinks and music

**The Bad (not much to note here)**

\-Definitely geared to older folks which is fine, my wife and I are not bothered by this but if Cunard does not accommodate younger folks a tad more I can see them start to struggle in the next few decades.

\-Personally would have liked to see live jazz a bit more but that's just a personal nitpick.

\-Felt strange most activities were only 45 minutes, I understand this needs to be done to fit more things in but I definitely felt some things could have went on for much longer.

Overall the atmosphere of the ship was excellent. It was very nice to see people a bit more dressed up on average even totally dressed up on Gala nights, how often do we really get to do this anymore? Really brought the vibe up a notch, it was nice to get together as a huge group and just enjoy ourselves. It was lovely to match some friends with the table next to ours in the dining room, we were pretty introverted so it was a nice surprise. This was truly an amazing experience, it was even a bit eventful at times. There was some sort of medical emergency on board which resulted in us returning to the coast of Newfoundland so the Canadian Coast Guard could fly in via helicopter to air lift the passenger away, this happened on the only rough night of the voyage and the landing zone was right at the end of our hallway! Made for an eventful, late evening but it was something we will certainly remember. This resulted in putting us even more behind schedule though, thankfully the Captain was able to speed up and partially make up for lost time. We ended up only being roughly 4 hours behind schedule in Southampton, again not an issue for us as we were spending a couple days in London.

Disembarking the ship itself was fine, the issue we ran into was finding our private vehicle we booked though Cunard that was taking us to London, there was nobody really directing us around and when we sought help we were told he was not yet here. An hour later a different staff member ran up to us and told us the driver had been waiting for us for ages! Thankfully he was not upset - or at least did not let it show. He took us direct to London which was very nice not needing to wait for a different taxi, a bus or a train. It was a bit pricier but well worth it.

All in all I rate the trip a solid 9/10, we are already discussing going on an Alaska cruise with Cunard! Could not suggest Cunard more, it was a wonderful experience for young, first timers like us.",7,1731126626.0,CunardCruises,1,1.0,False

I do my best to provide my child with the things he needs and be a positive role model. 

Having said that, right now in my life I’m lacking that special someone, as cliche as it may be.

I’m a bit of a hopeless romantic and still kinda believe there is someone out there for me.

I’ve done the online dating apps and it’s not really for me. Browsing profiles and swiping left or right is a weird experience for me. 

“Ah yes this girl looks cute, likes coffee, gym, walking and movie/music, I’m sure we will be a great match based on allllll of this information.” 

L O L 

You get the point, so I’m here on Reddit, I’m sure some people at this point are rolling their eyes, but frankly put I’ve had many more great conversations on Reddit with people than I’ve ever had with people on dating apps. 

A little about me; 

My interest, creative writing, music, video games (don’t have much time as I used to for it ), going for walks/hikes/drives, beach combing, art and small art projects. Mental and physical well being. 

I work overnights, I’m up when people are asleep and asleep when people are normally up, probably another reason why I am choosing Reddit to look for romantic interest.

I stand 6’0, weigh about 195lbs, average body. Dark brown eyes, shaved head, beard that’s a mixture of black and grey. 

I pride myself on working hard and doing my best whatever it is I choose to do. I value honesty, loyalty, a great sense of humour and respect. You can expect the same from me.

If you have read all the above, please feel free to reach out and say hello. Picture exchange can be done at your convenience. 

Have a great evening everyone.",1,1731125939.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

1gn1t5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gn1t5m/has_anyone_had_there_ex_keep_tabs/,Has anyone had there ex keep tabs?,"So long story short my ex wanted a divorce after cheating on me. We got a divorce and she left me for this guy that goes to her university. I was of course upset but I eventually got over it and found peace with it but recently after 2 months of no contact she’s been checking my tiktok page every morning and every night like 8 times a day. She has her friends check my tiktok page as well. I only have like 3 videos of my self and I know it’s her because she’s lives in a different country and I can see that my viewers went up from that country. I’m just confused on why this is happening? The only explanation I could think of is that the honeymoon phase ended with that guy and she wants me back because of all the stuff I did for her after our honeymoon phase ended. For context I’d would buy her flowers every weekend, take her out for coffee almost every morning before her classes, converted religious for her, moved to a poorer country for her, and was lucky enough to study at home and get paid for it so I was always making dinner for her and taking care of the house. Don’t worry I have self respect and I know she’ll do it again if I go back but just curious if anyone else had there ex’s dump them for someone else and then want them back? What happened?",1,1731125625.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
