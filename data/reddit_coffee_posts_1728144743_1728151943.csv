1fwwbdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1fwwbdd/how_to_get_over_shame_guilt_impostersyndrome_for/,"How to get over shame, guilt, imposter-syndrome for taking it?","I'm currently job searching and came to realize I need to take Vyvanse full time and not skip days here and there but I'm struggling emotionally.

I feel like years of self-flagellating myself into doing literally anything has left some mark on it. I've been diagnosed for 5 years now but I think sometimes I feel ""What if I had just tried harder?!?"" and it feels like taking Vyvanse is like I gave up trying and I'm feeling a lot of guilt for it.  I'm aware of how irrational it is, but I still really wrestling with those feelings. I feel that as a woman in her late 20s as well, it's been hard not to put a huge amount of pressure on myself and not hold myself to the same standards as neurotypical women, if not higher.

But when I take it, I'm finally calm. I can focus on anything, I don't want to plug myself into a caffeinated sugar infusion just to fold my laundry, I am not bitter and mad at everyone, I actually reply to texts within a normal amount of days, I feel okay talking with my family and strangers, I'm not always in a rush, I think before I act. I feel optimistic and hopeful about my future and feel I can take things on, even challenging ones. I want to eat vegetables, I actually can sit down and learn to draw and not beat myself up for not being good enough on the first try.

I also have fear that because how it changes me around others, the people that I truly care about won't want to be around me anymore. I just don't feel as close to them on it..? I feel there are days where I would skip it when I knew I would hang out with my friends just to be the fun, bouncing all over the walls, kind of quirky friend... I am working on my people-pleasing ways.  I'm usually calmer, more confident but can formulate much more coherent thoughts. I notice that the people I usually don't get along with off my meds, I have an easier time talking with.

I always have this thought at the back of my head that says "" Vyvanse is dimming your spark!! It's society that wants to suppress you and you should revolt!!"". What is this spark? Laying in bed all morning, drinking enough coffee to get my heart out of my chest just to do a task frantically, picking up my guitar for 5 minutes, working on a short bit I sort of like, and then giving up and going back on my phone? I do feel I don't have all these very intense emotions that did push me here and there to make something good art-wise, but man, at what cost?

How have you got over those feelings- if you relate to any? I need to have someone talk some sense into me and I feel the people in my life don't fully grasp this.

1fwwa8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1fwwa8d/vanilla_perfume_reviews_the_good_the_bad_the_ugly/,"Vanilla Perfume Reviews: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly ","Do you love the smell of vanilla but every time you smell a vanilla perfume something is just ‚Ä¶. Off? Finding the perfect vanilla became my obsession, the ultimate challenge. Surely it shouldn‚Äôt be so hard to find a vanilla, the most beloved of fragrance notes, that smells good? But every time I smelled a vanilla perfume it smelt like plastic or playdoh or just sickly. To kick the difficulty of this journey up, I am SUPER sensitive to scents. I get major headaches very easily and I swear I never go nose blind, I just KEEP smelling the fragrance so I really need to love a scent. Which leads me to my quest to find the perfect vanilla‚Ä¶..I still feel like the journey isn‚Äôt over but I have tried quite a handful at this point, so wanted to share my thoughts. Perhaps for another kindred soul out there.

Please note that all noses are different so you may love something I don't, that's okay, I acknowledge there are a few golden child vanillas I didn't vibe with.

To keep things simple, I am rating from favorites to least favorites:

**The Short List of Winners:**

**1.¬†¬†¬†¬† Jovoy Fire At Will:** When I first smelled I thought, ‚Äúthis is really pretty, but I am not blown away‚Äù. But then I started wearing my sample and this delicate beauty became my favorite. I get a soft airy elegant vanilla ice cream scent on clothes. When I say vanilla ice cream I mean the finest French vanilla with a soft kiss of brown sugar. I get soft comforting whiffs of this perfume but that never overwhelms me. There may not be much \*oomph\* to this perfume but it‚Äôs airiness is what makes it perfect for a sensitive nose.

**2.¬†¬†¬†¬† Indult Tihota:** The girlies were not lying about this. I had that guy doing the exaggerated blinks gif reaction to this. It actually smells like VANILLA. What a novel concept. This is deep and rich and VANILLA!! I have some vanilla pods from Madagascar and it is a similar deep rich scent. I got this and Fire At Will at the first time and boy did I struggle to decide between the two. Where Fire At Will is airy, Tihota is dense. The reason I put Fire At Will above Tihota, is that I find Fire At Will a bit more versatile both in terms of places I can wear it and seasons to wear it. But dang. This baddie means vanilla business.

**3.¬†¬†¬†¬† Diptyque Eau Duelle:** Okay hear me out. This is one of my favorite perfumes but I do NOT get any vanilla. Like at all? I get warm comforting spices. I almost didn‚Äôt want to include it in a vanilla review but I know many people think of it as a vanilla forward perfume so here it is.



**Nice, but I either do not get vanilla or just don't find it full bottle worthy:**

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mazzolari Vaniglia:** I smelt this THROUGH the packaging it came in. I get a heavy marshmallow smell from this. While super pretty and realistic smelling, it was just a bit too sweet for me. However maybe if you have smelled Fire At Will or Tihota and thought, I want this but sweeter, this would be a good option for you.

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Xerjoff Dama Bianca:** This is a pretty girl. I actually like it and enjoyed my times wearing my sample. I get something akin to gentle fluidity gold with added brightness (florals and kumquat I am guessing). However I do not get any vanilla.

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† VCA Orchid√©e Vanille:** I dunno fam. This was so light to my nose. I got a last season‚Äôs Terry‚Äôs chocolate orange smell.

**-¬†¬†¬†Kilian Angel's Share:** Yep. Smells like apple pie.

-¬†¬†¬†**Maison Mataha Escapade Gourmande:** It‚Äôs ‚Äòaight. I sadly didn‚Äôt get the cr√®me brulee scent that others do. I got more of a sniffing a bag of white sugar smell? Like I could almost taste the crunchy sugar grains but there was no toastiness. Almost tempted to try it again to see if I can get that toasty smell because I want too so badly.

-¬†¬† **Billie Eilish Eilish:** I can see why this is popular! I smelt it on a friend and had to admit she smelled nice, but it was a touch waxy and cloying so I couldn‚Äôt see myself wearing it. I also got a strong cocoa note.¬†

**-¬†¬†¬†Lush Vanillary:** Didn‚Äôt offend me. Didn‚Äôt wow me. Love turmeric latte though.

**-¬†¬†JPG La Belle Le Parfum:** Didn‚Äôt stand out to me. A bit heavy and syrupy.

**- Burberry Goddess:** Undecided. I have a travel spray on the way. I don‚Äôt like the opening, it gives me Libre vibes and gives me a headache. But the dry down is nice when I have tested it. I am yet to decide if the dry down is enough to make up for the opening.

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Skylar Vanilla Sky:** Actually liked this little latte smelling cutie. Just doesn‚Äôt stand out enough to me to buy a bottle, but has made me more open to exploring coffee perfumes (unlike black opium, see wouldn‚Äôt catch me dead wearing).

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† MFK Gentle Fluidity Gold:** I mean. It‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not offensive but also didn‚Äôt have that wow factor to me. It was also slightly powdery to me. I don‚Äôt get the spices in it, just a warm soft baby power kind of smell, no real vanilla?

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Guerlain Angelique Noir:** It is both lovely and off-putting. But the bottom line is I would never buy it. The opening is GRASS. Freshly mowed. I get that strong grass whether on skin or clothes. Now the dry down is a *lovely* custard. It is truly very beautiful and rich, so I understand why this is so beloved and hailed as a unique vanilla. This it is. But I will go eat a vanilla pudding cup while sitting on a freshly mowed lawn for the same scent experience for much cheaper.¬† ¬†

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Guerlain Spirituese Double Vanille:** Sigh. I do like this one, a lot. She is bad and boujie. And I have been close to buying a bottle a couple of times. But something feels missing? Even after a long-time macerating. I can‚Äôt put my finger on it but there is something almost fuzzy about this.

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Micallef Note Vanillee:** Eh?? I get strong spicy booze, not so much vanilla.

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† House of Sillage Hufflepuff:** She‚Äôs cute!! She is bright and sweet. Just didn‚Äôt blow me away enough to justify the price.

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mizensir Tres Chere:** I like the warm salty malty vanilla in this but something makes me slightly sick to my stomach. It may be my nemesis orange blossom or maybe it‚Äôs the saltiness.

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lancome Idole Aura:** Another salty, and rosey, vanilla that is really pretty but too overwhelming for me.

-**Phlur Vanilla Skin:** Meh. Didn't stand out, kind of plasticky.

**-Poets of Berlin:** Huh this one is unique. I get more greeness/bamboo than any vanilla. Sometimes I wear this and love it, other times it really turns me off.

  


**Wouldn‚Äôt Catch Me Dead Wearing:**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Kayali Vanila28**: Um no. I tried to love this. I wanted the rich brown sugar people kept talking about. I even got a full bottle and tried to let it macerate for almost a year. I tried wearing it numerous times, different seasons etc. I even got a travel spray thinking maybe my full bottle was jank?? But no. This BURNS MY NOSE. When I wear it, it literally dries my eyes out? This is sharp and acidic.

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† JHAG Vanilla Vibes:** Nauseating. Smells like sunscreen.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **MFK Grand Soir**: I usually like to take tester strips home to see how the perfume through the day. But with this I threw my tester strip away before even exiting the building.

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Replica By the Fireplace:** I saw a review once that said it would be better as a fall candle and I agree. However Anthropologie‚Äôs Vanilla Dore smells like this minus the smoke so it is a big improvement but still heavy and cloying.

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Xerjoff Lira:** Yep. Smells like lemon poundcake. Rather buy a BBW fragrance.

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Kilian Love Don‚Äôt Be Shy & Princess:** BARF! Nauseating sweet. And wtf how is this so expensive.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Giardini di Toscana Biancolatte:** A girl sitting behind me in one of my classes wears this and it makes me queasy af. Don‚Äôt @ me over this. This is another one I tried to love. It smelt like wet biscuits on my skin. Wet MILKY biscuits on clothes. And now when I smell it on someone it is so thick, like I am sticking my nose in vanilla candle wax.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **YSL Black Opium & the Le Parfum:** No. Migraine in a bottle and migraine in a bottle x2

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† TF Tobacco Vanille, TF Vanilla Sex, TF Vanille Fatale:** No, Huge No, No.

**-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Ariana Grande Vanilla Mod:** This made me realize what people mean when they say something smells synthetic. I love miss ponytail‚Äôs Cloud Intense and R.E.M. so I am not an Ari hater but this one was a no.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Anthropologie‚Äôs Outremer Vanilla:** I. I just don‚Äôt get vanilla? But a ton of people do so worth giving it a shot.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Parfum de Marly Oriana:** After trying this and Love Don‚Äôt Be Shy I think I just can't do sweet smells + orange blossom. Big no from me.

**- Boy Smells Vanilla Era**: Everything from this house is toilet water.



**Honorable Vanilla Adjacent Mentions:** I love Delina Exclusif and Trish McEvoy‚Äôs Blackberry and Vanilla Musk. I do not however think either of these are vanilla forward, but I do love them and they have vanilla notes so wanted to mention them.



*Body Care Bonus:*

-I do not like EOS vanilla cashmere. Yes it smells like frosting. No I do not want to smell like that it is nauseating.

* I do however like Laura Mercier Ambre Vanille. I see why people think bum bum cream. I wore this side by side with the bum bum cream and they are similar vibes. However where I think bum bum cream is more tropical/summer leaning, Ambre Vanille is more all seasons. Feels sophisticated or maybe that is my brain telling me that due to how expensive it was.

-The OGX coconut and coffee wash/lotion slaps and goes so well under Fire At Will and Tihota. That dove coconut and brown sugar sugar is also insanely delicious.

-Dove shea butter and warm vanilla will forever be my OG body wash. The olay shea is also really nice.

So basically I was sitting in a small desk watching YouTube with my laptop, and my phone was put beside touch pad on the laptop.

Her behaviour just triggered me (and saved my dear phone), so I pushed her map out, and saw her hand holding my phone. As she sneakingly moves her hand towards her body, I assume if five more seconds given, my phone would have already been in her pockets. After her dirty trick was spotted, she put my phone down and went away.

This is a very bad thing to me, but at least I'm triggered. Weeks ago a friend of mine told me that her phone was actually stolen in a quite similar way in McDonalds, Earls court. When listening to her experience, I thought 'this could never happen to me', but just now I found that I'm so wrong. Even in so-called 'posh safe area' like Chelsea I experienced this, what should I expect in other areas? I'm scared actually... I would never put my phone on the desk when eating or drinking coffee outside.",1,1728151080.0,u_Angze_Li,0,1.0,False

I'm starting a volunteer job at a cat rescue on Monday. I haven't done anything resembling work in a long time. I think it'll be all right. I'll be around cats the whole time, and I  looooove animals. (So, I'd fuck a sheep.) Comment if you get the reference....

Sorry, I'm being weird because this is making me nervous as hell. 

I'll be going to Walmart beforehand, and I want to buy myself a treat for dinner. It can't be anything that has to be kept cold, because they don't have a fridge, I checked. I'm using an insurance grocery healthy benefits card, so it can't be junk. It has to be something shelf-stable that would be considered healthy.

This card pays for Ramen noodles and coffee/creamer, so, you know, processed shelf food is ok. Things like canned food and stuff.

There are so many choices at a grocery store. I don't even know where to start looking on the app. Going to the grocery store in person makes me want to lose my mind. I'm having the same feeling now.

Does anyone have any ideas? Starchy things are safe foods for me.

I am in this comically beautiful southern city that is miles away from my comfortable but soulless new world suburbia and I have suddenly decided to become the lamest person alive.

I'm 19 and have always lived with my parents. tbh I had a very very long awkward stage that left me doing things like forcing myself through finnegans wake at 16 instead of having an actual life but I've managed to thaw out a bit now I'm on medication and I managed to have an ok social life this year.

however now that I'm entirely free, living on my own, in a student city with tons of bars and clubs and tapas everywhere all I do is stay at home and play geoguessr/have esex with my 35 year old situationship who didn't tell me about his fianc√©e for like 3 months but long story short I really degraded myself sexually after 18 when I tried to force myself out of my frumpy high school era and he treated me pretty well so as much as I know it is kind of a miserable situation (she is moving to nz in January) it is the only good thing I have ever had in that genre of relationship after having been ugly and weird and chubs in school

I'm proficient in spanish and no longer chubs and not even that socially stunted. like definitely uncool but I think in an endearing way. is that desperate? I'm so shy I can't even go out and order coffee and ive still not had any spanish food ive just been cooking my dad's stir fry recipe at home every night and making sandwiches. I try not to make excuses for myself but I can't even wear like fun outfits because in my tortured poets era I cut my arms a lot and I haven't been able to wear a tank top since some teenage girls laughed and pointed at me in a Singapore Uniqlo (which was so embarrassing it mostly cured me and I've been clean since so I gotta thank them)

I just need not even a brat summer or a bacchanalia situation omg I just need to stop being a loser. I want to be in the club. I have a really low alcohol tolerance before I get sleepy but I can totally try and have like 5 cups of coffee beforehand

should I have waited until I was in my 20s? am I cooked? is there anything I can do alone that isn't tragic? will someone ever love me like the 35 year old man who is half using me half trying to be 20 again? what would you do. what should I do? like a checklist? fuck. also do I sound really annoying in this post?

I keep modifying to make it more accurate but no results. I even go up. It‚Äôs stupid. Please read before jumping the gun though. 

F35 5,4‚Äù 160lbs. Pretty much sedentary.

My calculated TDEE is somewhere around 1500-1700 according to calculators. I keep gaining weight there though. My Apple Watch give me an average resting energy of 1300 though, and considering I‚Äôm sedentary I decided to roll with that then. 

Eating below 1200 is unhealthy though so to give me enough of a deficit I gotta start moving too, right? Alright. 1200 cals and I decide I‚Äôm going to walk.

I started playing Pok√©mon GO a month ago. Went from 3k steps a day to an average of 6k. Been taking 1-5 mile walks every day for a couple weeks. According to the watch these walks are somewhere between 100-300 cals. Avg heart reate at 120 so should be fat burning zone, too. Cool that will help pad the deficit a bit more. 

I do NOT eat the exercise calories back. I eat 1200. 

Well nope. In three weeks the scale hasn‚Äôt moved. 

Now for the food. I can screenshot my Lose It logs for proof. Lol. 

Breakfast is coffee w creamer. 
Lunch and dinner are around 700-800 calories both. It‚Äôs usually some lean protein and veggies, canned soup, salad, avocado toast. I measure everything: The dressing in the salad, I use spray avocado oil and just spray a bit. I don‚Äôt use butter. I measure the meat. 
The only snack I have is a couple hours after dinner. I have a popsicle, some flan or sugar free jello. This is measured too bringing my total to 1200. 

I drink water with my meals, water throughout the day etc. No liquid calories besides the creamer in the coffee in the morning (it‚Äôs two tablespoons and counted)

Every other weekend I ‚Äúcheat‚Äù on a Friday night and Saturday by eating over 1200 and more closer to maintenance. I still measure. I still drink water only. So if it‚Äôs a surplus is a small one. I‚Äôm not eating over 2000. 

If you‚Äôre gonna tell me the problem is the cheat day please explain how one/two surplus days biweekly undo two weeks of deficit and I‚Äôll eliminate that too.

I swear I‚Äôm measuring and counting I‚Äôm not cheating myself‚Ä¶ why is it not moving even a half pound??

1fww5o3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fww5o3,Transcontinental Race No. 10 // recap // day 1,"After about 2 hours, the night is already over. The first thing I do is check the tracking website, and I realize that almost all the other riders pushed through the first night without sleeping. That surprises me. Because it‚Äôs my first race and I have no experience, my plan was not to rush things at the beginning. This decision will later come back to me. I quickly pack up my things, carry my bike down the stairs, and set off on the first day. The route starts flat, passing through Belgium, then the Netherlands and then crossing into Germany near Aachen. At this point in the race, two main groups have already formed. In the months before, I decided to take a flatter but longer route through Germany. At 17:00 pm, it‚Äôs time for lunch, so I grab 5 burgers, fries, ice cream, and coffee at Burger King. After that, I hit the only climb of the day, heading towards Wiesbaden. Everything still feels familiar at this point, and I believe I made the right choice with this route. At 23:00 pm, I stock up on cola and snacks at a sp√§ti. For this night, I had already planned a good sleeping spot in advance, but to reach it, I‚Äôd have to ride until early morning again. So, I decide not stick to my sleep plan and look for a place to sleep on the go. Because I can‚Äôt find anything suitable in the next hour, I check Google Maps again and find a playground with a roof. When I get there, there were still people around. So, I move on to a second spot, but it‚Äôs full of mosquitoes. Not a great place for a quiet sleep. So, I continue on to a lake with a shelter. I arrive there at 1:45 am. The whole process cost me a lot of time and I‚Äôm determined that it won‚Äôt happen again.

1) no formal dining space is necessary 
2) bookcase
3) coffee station, right now it‚Äôs on the back of the kitchen counter opposite the back door
4) movement through the space from/to doors is important as I have kids/pets that travel through this space a lot

They confronted him but the goon warned them that they have to give 50000rs to them as they violated society rules and then only they will have their laptop back. 

After knowing this, we contacted police and used some influence but the goons are not backing and are ready to go to any extent. We want to file a case but considering that they are just there for education and these goons may make some issues further as they have some local political power, we are backing down. 

And fyi, they Physically assaulted students and also robbed from them and also are demanding money. We did inform this to the society leader but that mf says that he doesn't want to get involved.

Money is not an issue but ego is.

Any serious advice or help is really appreciated.

I am looking into other co-morbidities of ASD like bipolar, depression and anxiety for several reasons (people I know, own experiences, family members). And I am starting to wonder what if it's not ADHD but more a mix of ASD related inattentiveness + anxiety + rumination + stimming + mood changes (energy boosts & low energy phases)? 
I tried Strattera, helped clear the brain fog. 
Helped to get better sleep. Hyperfocus and ASD traits more pronounced. Had to stop it due to dysautonomia. 
I tried Adderall. Became way more irritated. Way awake. And ASD traits more pronounced including smiling less often, more serious, less relaxed but with a clearer mind. Easier to organize my thoughts. Had to stop, HR was too much, body felt constantly stressed. 
I now try Ritalin. 54mg ER was too much, similar stress response of my body, jittery when it wears off. Clearer mind which is a plus and no need for coffee. But I don't like how it makes my body feel. And it also feels like I am way too serious, smile less ect. My silly more relaxed and spontanous self is missing.  I am also extremely hyperfocussed on it, aka for longer periods of time which I think is more my ASD than anything else.. I can hyperfocus on tasks too even if they aren't dopamine related in order to solve a problem I think is important to solve when off meds as well, just not to this extreme. 

It's hard to tell how much ADHD I am, despite computerized neuro tests showing that I am. 
As a kid it was hard for me to sit still, but not to an extreme, in hindsight it looks more like ADD related stimming (old family videos) for regulation than anything else. In elementary school teachers said I was daydreaming a lot. 

What are your experiences? Did your DX ever change from ADHD to anxiety? 
I am more a slug on a normal day and have occasionally bursts of energy but when younger I couldn't stay in much at my own place, constantly was on the go. 
Of course I will address those things with a counselor. I need to look more into this because of my daughter as well. 
So what are your experiences with stimulants and how do you manage your ADHD meds with dysautonomia in the mix and or anxiety? And or bipolar?

It went from a weekly occurrence to almost every 2-3 days. I sometimes would feel it daily for a short stint.

I asked my doctor about it and we did the appropriate blood work and i put on a heart monitor for 2 weeks (the one you click when you feel something). I was pretty diligent about it and clicked it everytime i felt something.

The results came back and my doctor said they saw nothing out of the ordinary, and recommended cutting caffeine.

The thing is: i make coffee twice a day (i do it manually with an espresso machine, 2 shots each cup) BUT i basically drink 30% of each. I really like the latte art part and just always end up forgetting to drink. Caffeine never really felt like it had an impact on me, i never had issues sleeping despite drinking coffee at 8pm sometimes. Basically, i wouldn‚Äôt put my coffee intake as anything above 1 cup a day.

Fast forward to the past week where i‚Äôve felt irregular rythms daily and consistently. I‚Äôve now completely cut caffeine for 2 days and haven‚Äôt noticed bad heart rythms‚Ä¶ my question is: is it really that possible for a single cup of coffee to really mess up heart rythms like that when i always thought caffeine had almost 0 effect on me?

My heart health definitely comes first and i don‚Äôt really depend on coffee, so i can easily cut it out of my life for health reasons‚Ä¶ but i guess does my experience make any sense? Or am i just luckily not feeling anything these past 2 days.

My AP, 40M, is also married. Every time I am around my AP and there‚Äôs nothing sexual that happens, I am completely fine afterwards. I even get all the fun feelings! As soon as it turns sexual in any way, I get self conscious during the encounter and then I spend days after trashing my own self esteem. I overthink every detail regretting that I couldn‚Äôt come out of my shell completely. I beat myself up to the point that I have debilitating anxiety for days after and can‚Äôt stop dwelling on how sexually open I used to be compared to the recent encounters. I used to never be self conscious or reserved in the bedroom, even with newer partners, so I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs a lingering effect from the DB. The sexual encounters are still good and my AP has never implied otherwise. It‚Äôs more how I feel about myself. I know I am holding back but I can‚Äôt find a way to shake it. Is it fear of rejection? Low self confidence? 

I have always been a very confident person. I‚Äôve managed to limit the effects the DB has had on my daily life confidence, or at least I think I have. So this is not something I even thought would be an issue before starting the affair. 

I haven‚Äôt brought this up with my AP for a couple of reasons. 1. I would rather not trauma dump my issues onto him. The affair is still new, we‚Äôve only had 4-5 sexual interactions over less than a 2 month period. 2. His opinion is not my problem. It‚Äôs how I feel about myself and my inability to be as free in my sexuality as I once was.

For context: I got this job thru my tuesday, wednesday, thursday family. The baby I take care of TWTH is very sweet, I love the family, and we all have a good relationship. Well when he was about four months old, his mom messaged me saying that her sister was also about to give birth and needed some help with the baby. I said yes because I was very new to the nanny life and if I loved this family wouldn‚Äôt I love the other?

Wrong. 

Never assume. 

I start working for them almost immediately after the baby was born, on Monday, Fridays, Saturdays. The vibes were already different. The mom has a bit of an eating disorder, very thin already but in the fridge there‚Äôs no food and if there is everything has to be low fat, reduced, keto, atkins, and there‚Äôs so many supplements in the fridge.

I was working for about three months and then I noticed they put up cameras every where. I don‚Äôt have a problem with them but I felt I was doing something wrong since they weren‚Äôt there when I started and now I am under surveillance in MULTIPLE angles. I was uncomfortable because I felt they were sending me a message.

Some time goes by, the MFS family moves to a new home and now that‚Äôs where things definitely start to shift.

The mom has some problems, you can just tell. Clean freak, OCD problems. There are so many rules and preferences that they have over EVERYTHING but they don‚Äôt tell me until after I do it and they realize they don‚Äôt like it. 

The MFS baby is a year old now, when he was six months I was trying to give him solid food and they freaked out on me. Time goes by now he‚Äôs older and still can‚Äôt chew. When he swallows he gags, he doesn‚Äôt know how to break down his food. I gave him a piece of tortilla and he really liked it. But then, of course, that made them tell me not to do that. That he wasn‚Äôt ready for it (he was one). I‚Äôve been concerned about him being able to learn to chew but I guess i‚Äôm just the nanny and not the parent? So whenever I feed him they kind of get upset i‚Äôm not feeding him mush. ( I give him veggies, toast, blueberries, small age appropriate foods). 

On top of that, there‚Äôs no food for me to even GIVE HIM. I don‚Äôt know what they eat, I can‚Äôt even introduce him to anything because there‚Äôs absolutely nothing. Ingredient household to the max except there‚Äôs not a lot of ingredients and half of them are keto. 

The baby doesn‚Äôt even like eating puree. He gets so upset. He wants to eat. The lack of food and the fact that they also don‚Äôt want to give him solids, makes it very frustrating for me. 

Then one day out of the blue the dad goes, you haven‚Äôt been giving him his fish oil in his formula? And i‚Äôm SO confused. No I haven‚Äôt. I was never told that was a thing. And he was like well we‚Äôve been giving it to him in his afternoon bottle so start doing that. 

HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW IF HE NEEVER TOLD ME ????

His cousin (TWTH) was eating solids at six months and has been eating real food for a year already. MFS is eating mush. Even for his first birthday they had mexican food catered and they still gave him baby food when there was rice and beans. 

I get the OCD and the caution of not wanting to ‚Äúmove to fast‚Äù and not wanting him to choke but he‚Äôs having a hard time. He doesn‚Äôt like puree and the only yogurt they have for him is greek and he hates it. 

Now I come into work one day and I go to hold the baby and the dad shields the baby from me. I was so confused. He said , ‚Äúyou need to wash your hands before you hold him.‚Äù Completely caught me off guard. They didn‚Äôt even warn me. I felt dirty and I still feel dirty. Anytime I try to hold them they‚Äôre like oh did you wash your hands? Go wash them. 

When they decide to implement new rules, they don‚Äôt even tell me until after I ‚Äúbreak‚Äù one. Which makes me feel like i‚Äôm always getting caught or getting in trouble. 

The other day when I first walked in I was bit by an ant on my arm. I didn‚Äôt think much of it because I haven‚Äôt seen an ant in a while. Later, I was feeding the baby some cheese and I was making myself one (1) piece of toast and peanut butter that I brought from home and drinking a coffee I made. I see ants against the back splash, climbing on tissue boxes, and up my coffee cup. I said ‚Äúomg there‚Äôs so many ants‚Äù to myself and the dad comes in and he‚Äôs basically like there‚Äôs ants üòê. And I change my tone QUICKLY and said oh yea there‚Äôs a little bit of them üòÖ. Well he got upset/ salty and said well there‚Äôs bread crumbs everywhere and food out so let‚Äôs not leave anymore food out. 

That made me feel like he was blaming me for the ants? Just the way he said it and the way he spoke about it I was so confused. I was eating the toast??? The baby had food on his high chair. there were ants in my coffee. i‚Äôm literally only here for two days out of the week now because of classes but yet I was still told I leave food out. (I know that‚Äôs what he meant because the wife is a clean freak and there‚Äôs literally no sign of life anywhere in this house) but all I did was make breakfast. I‚Äôm a guest in the house if anything at this point and yet he was telling me I leave food out. I always clean up after. 

Now today is kind of my last straw. 

I go into the guest bedroom when the baby is sleeping because I am taking medication that makes me fatigue. In their old house I would just sit on the couch in the living room because it was one story. now this house is two stories. Once he starts crying from his nap you need to be quick to getting him out of the crib asap because he likes to climb out and he might hurt himself. I started going into the guest bedroom because it‚Äôs across the hall from his room which is upstairs. 

Today I get told ‚Äúdo you mind not sitting on the guest bedroom my wife doesn‚Äôt like outside clothes on the bed.‚Äù i‚Äôm over it. For real. I literally wake up and put CLEAN FRESH WASHED CLOTHES ON and go to their house. My clothes are always clean because the baby has eczema and I didn‚Äôt know if he was allergic to laundry detergent so I always kept them clean just in case. 

But they make me feel SO dirty. It‚Äôs just the way they say these things. I am so confused. I get not wanting someone on your guest bed (I used it to contact nap the baby when he wouldn‚Äôt let me put him down) but i utilized it. No one ever uses that room. I kept it clean. But the fact that everything comes back to me washing my hands, my outside clothes, keep your shoes outside. I‚Äôm over it. 


It‚Äôs hard to bond with baby when there‚Äôs so many rules around him. I can‚Äôt do anything with him. We sit inside all day and that‚Äôs not the kind of nanny I am. My TWTH baby and I do so many things. He can play in dirt, go to the rivers and creeks, eat food, run around and be a kid. The MFS baby can‚Äôt do any of that. 

I feel so bad for him. And the dad also is always home at all times basically micromanaging me. I just don‚Äôt understand what I am here for if they clearly know how they want to take care of their baby and i‚Äôm just not the vibe for them. 



Since the baby MFS and TWTH are cousins, it‚Äôs awkward if I quit. But I am going to by December. I can‚Äôt take it anymore.

edit: Note: I said she has an eating disorder because when she was pregnant, she was hospitalized multiple times for under eating because she didn‚Äôt want to gain any weight through her pregnancy. She was already very thin throughout her whole pregnancy but I guess she was making sure of it. The baby has a strict diet and there‚Äôs not a lot of options for him to eat because of it.

Would you choose the VBM or the Lelit?
My main points of concern are the reliability and steaming capabilities because I only drink milk based drinks. We make two flat whites in the morning and maybe one or two more at night but mostly just 2 a day. I'm not so picky but of course a PID will make life easier but a heat exchanger PID will be good enough for me.

The Lelit comes with 1 year local warranty which I don't feel too confident about, and the VBM comes with a 3 year local warranty that I know is certified by VBM (i emailed them) and the seller is an old company 20+ years in the local business.

Would the dual boiler make THAT much difference? Noting i plan on keeping this machine for around 10 years.

I own a Gaggia classic pro and my main reason for upgrading is the steaming and making two drinks back to back are pain in the neck.

1fwv9c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1fwv9c3/my_life_is_1000_lonelier_since_social_media/,My life is 1000% lonelier since social media ,"For me life was infinitely happier before social media- people responded to phone calls or texts & paid each other attention in real life, were willing to meet up for coffee or snacks or do things spontaneously & spent more time in person in the moment with each other without worrying about appearances as much or impressing the world. It was a healthier and happier time in my opinion. 

If you lived through times before social media, what is your experience?

I‚Äôll start- this is from a male perspective:

- when asking to meet for coffee people replied instead of ignoring you if you‚Äôre not in the top percentages of looks
- we had healthy in person conversations instead of friends being distracted by their phones
- when asking people to meet up for a chat they showed genuine interest in you instead of displaying lack of patience because they want to be on social media
- when enjoying a meal out people would talk to each other and enjoy the moment instead of ignoring you on their phones
- people were more patient
- people had conversations and listening skills
- meetings were more authentic
- meeting up was about the other person instead of being about showing off popularity or taking photos
- new people you met wouldn‚Äôt assume you‚Äôre boring because you‚Äôre not on social media
- people were less judgemental of different opinions
- people had more independent thought and could analyse things logically instead of being overcome with emotion 
- if you messaged someone they replied quickly unlike nowadays it can be days or weeks until anyone replies leading to loneliness more than ever 
- if you‚Äôre not in the top percentages of looks people still showed interest in you instead of ignoring you totally 
- you could choose other interests instead of being forced to go gym and be lean just to be able to attract basic friends to prevent isolation
- people were willing to meet up in person instead of insisting on texting online
- life was deeper instead of superficial
- when trying to arrange to meet in person people would reply quickly instead of taking weeks to reply or never replying
- not wanting to use artificial screens was considered normal rather than weird, leading to fewer headaches

Having lived through both times, in my opinion, life is so much lonelier and less fulfilling since social media was invented.

Unit 1: almost from out of the box, there was a constant ‚Äúclean the needles‚Äù message every time I brewed a cup. Cleaning the needles didn‚Äôt help. So, they replaced unit 1.

Unit 2: worked sort of OK at first except when it didn‚Äôt. About half the time unit 2 wouldn‚Äôt read the k-cup coffee brand and I had to raise and lower the handle multiple times to get it read. Then we were away for a couple of weeks. When we got back, unit 2 reported that it was not connected to wifi. Everything else in my house was working fine. I tried everything to reconnect, to no avail. Router reboots, factory resets, app removal and reinstallation, cellular data on and off. The process would sometimes link and sometimes not. When it did link it was unable to connect to my wifi. Nothing weird about my wifi and as I mentioned, Unit 2 was connected and working fine when we left for our trip. So they‚Äôve replaced unit 2.

There were a couple years after where socializing with people at a restaurant job was fine I guess but I was deeply depressed and never attended anything they invited me to.

I'm about to be 32, my depression from this has basically made me isolate for 10 years. I just don't know how to... speak to strangers about themselves anymore. I can't even talk about myself, I don't really do anything. Idk if it's depression or just me but I don't see anything as enjoyable anymore, no goal of any kind seems worth the stress and likely failure I'd experience trying to achieve it. Job is... ok I guess but not going in any direction.

""What do you do for fun?"". I collect comic book collected books and half ass guitar practice a couple times a week, I walk my dog, I sit in coffee shops. That's it.

I will summarize how it went with advice to help others who may be on this journey.  For context I am 53M and she is 42F.  And we have been chatting online for about 10 days already.  I have never been in an LDR, she was for a period of time but ultimately failed.  Neither of us have been on a ""virtual date"".

* We agreed on a mutual time about 5 days ago.  We are 13 hours time different (I am US and she is in Philippines).  So it was my morning and her evening.
* I decided to go to a local coffee shop, to make it more realistic on my side.  I did not expect her to go anywhere.  I ordered my coffee and she made coffee - so it was a coffee date!!
   * And, we both dressed nicely.
* We planned to chat only for an hour - but ended up talking for 3 hours.  We had to end because my battery on my phone was dying.  Video takes up a lot of battery.
* Our conversation was broad:
   * Family, childhood, children
   * Education
   * Work
   * Eating, exercise, health habits
   * Religious beliefs
   * Our travels
   * Likes/dislikes
* There are topics we avoided, not because we agree to them but it is common sense to avoid:
   * Sex - not appropriate at all during the first date
   * Hopes, wishes, dreams for ""us"" - at this early stage, we do not know quite yet if there will be an ""us""  - we hope so, but still so much more to learn.  We both want to get through each day one at a time.  We have no clue yet what the future will bring, and it is too early to discuss that.
   * Past relationships - those are in the past and quite honestly has no bearing on the future unless it is important to share.
   * Painful memories that are best shared in person where tears will be shed
   * We did not discuss anything about loving each other.  Some of it is implied, but saying it on a first date not appropriate.  We did, however, blow kisses which I think is fine.
* Part of the evolution is an in-person visit. We both agree that we do not want to waste each others time  if being in person does not bring any chemistry.
   * I will go there in 5 weeks and stay for 2 weeks.
      * She works during the day, which will be fine by me.
      * We have not decided sleeping arrangements yet.  I offered to sleep in my hotel and she in her apartment (me offering is the right thing to do).  She has not agreed yet to this arrangement.
      * We are not planning anything special - just go one day at a time.
   * If that goes well, then I will go back at Christmas and New Years for a more intimate time together.
      * Here we will plan something more special and start the New Year on a positive note.
* We agreed it was perfect successful first date.
   * The most important thing is that we agreed to keep doing same time and place each week unless something comes up.",4,1728147379.0,LongDistance,1,1.0,False

I started on Vyanse/Tyvense about two weeks ago. I started off on a 30mg dose and then moved up to a 40mg dose. For the first week, I think I noticed the effects of the tablet a lot more - especially with my heartbeat. After about two hours after taking my pill, I would notice my heart beating really fast. I went for a run one day about 8 or 9 hours after taking it and couldn't keep my heartbeat in zone 2 for the life of me. If I had a coffeeeven 5-6 hours after taking the pill, my heart would start racing again.



Since switching to the 40mg, I've stopped noticing the effects as much, especially with my heartbeat. I haven't really noticed any issues with heartbeat, and I seem to be able to manage coffee much better. Which is great- but it's also confusing that the higher dose seems to have less impact. Sometimes I wonder did I get dud pills!

Charlie a recently alcoholic turned sober detective, has taken a new case from his boss, he argues that he wasn‚Äôt told why or how to prepare for it but he gets off the phone dumbfounded by the situation he is in and agrees to take the case. He previously got back from a long vacation that left him feeling well rested. He gets his keys but wonders if he really should take on this case, as he wants to retire after returning back from his trip. He grabs his watch, his badge, some clothes, his toothbrush, and a suitcase and his notes and locks his house and leaves feeling unsettled even though he has to do this one final job for his boss, he turns the lights off and leaves a note for his wife on the fridge & locks the door, in the pouring rain and runs to his car. Charlie is in for a long night and struggles to pursue his endeavors on this last case.

He finds a hotel and stays in there to rest after the long drive. He is exhausted so he gets in bed and rests. A few hours later he hears a noise like a window was broken into he wakes up grabs his light & walks into the hallway he looks around but no one is awake. He looks through a window but only sees a small cat who looks back only to run off in the rain. He scratches his head but is tired so he goes back to bed. The next day Charlie meets an older man who calls himself the caretaker he explains that the hotel has free room service & he can ring him at any time for anything he needs. Charlie unpacks his things walks to his room and starts to work on his case. He finds a complimentary drink in the room with peanuts but is worried he may resort to his old ways of drinking unresponsively and hides it away for his safety.

The next morning Charlie wakes up takes a shower & walks down through the stairs of the hotel trying to find the ice machine, before he can find it he looks at a bright yellow light trying to decipher what he saw, Charlie feeling disoriented takes the light into the cellar to check for rats & ice and hears more noises which sounded like the one that he heard from the previous night. Hidden behind the walls he finds the¬†undead¬†corpses of two of the caretakers relatives‚Ä¶. one with blood looking fresh and the other more old, He looks around at the dust & remains feeling unsettled lighting his torch & the light, he walks on looking for other clues. Beneath the walls building he steps behind and slowly goes down the stairs finding a dark basement looking broken but recently used, Charlie finds a washing machine & some old map pieces behind it he crawls down moving his foot while shining the light underneath the washer pushes it to the side but finds nothing but a small key underneath and half of a map, Charlie picks up the key and the map puts both in his pocket then gets up and frantically walks back to the hotel. Startled at what he saw he runs to the hotel manager. He explains that 2 fresh bodies were found dead & declares someone to go down & call the police. The manager assures him that they had a robbery and that everyone is safe the manager tells Charlie to stay in his room & lock his door.

The managers phone rings so he picks it up and speaks into the phone he says, ‚Äúyes we have it under control I will call you back‚Äù and hangs up, the manager writes down Charlie‚Äôs information & room number & tells him to go back to his room since two detectives are coming and will question all the hotel residents if they need any help. Charlie feels frustrated and says theres something going on but he will be back. He walks back to his room and pours himself some scotch to ail his nerves. He drinks the scotch but still feels frustrated while he takes out his notepad & documents everything for the case, he reaches into his pocket looking at the dirty key the key had an interesting detail on It with a heart shape carved into the front rotates it but puts it back in his pocket. Charlie writes down notes documenting everything he had seen still uneasy he drinks the whole bottle of scotch then falls asleep. An hour later he wakes up & hears a knock on his door he gets up & says ‚Äújust a minute,‚Äù & walks to the door opens it and upon seeing the 2 detectives says hello to both the men who show him their badges, both with black mustaches ask if he has heard anything weird, Charlie states he went to get some ice but said he had been hired to look into the disappearance of a young couple and that he doesn‚Äôt know what is going on. The men look at each other then back at Charlie saying they may call him if they need any more information thanking him saying they work across the precinct on this case as well & walk off before one of the men returns giving Charlie his card reaching into his suit thanks him and catches up with his partner.

The next day Charlie leaves the hotel packs up his things pays the clerk, and drives off to get some food, worried how the case could be connected to the hotel, he starts to think about both the residence and the mysterious men he saw upon leaving his car after his lunch, Charlie forgets his badge and returns to the hotel driving back but as he returns he hears more noises, so Charlie walks toward the back of the hotels hallway & looks onward and walks down the stairs again, he looks around and picks up a dirty 18th century vampiric book that reads ‚Äúthe village of chapel vera,‚Äù Charlie is confused but then remembered his old roommate Robert took up residence in Chapelwake a small ghost town that was across from him a few blocks down from the hotel called Chapel haven, so he wonders if chapel vera and Chapelwake are connected within the town. Charlie takes his lighter & sets fire to the book, then returns upstairs so that no one will find it‚Ä¶. The book becomes inflamed hot & blazed but turns green, but notices one of the pages is missing, a distressed Charlie looks around thinking it may still be around here but he cant find anything except dirt & soot, everything has been cleaned & picked thoroughly by the previous owners of the hotel so he leaves the basement gives up on finding the page & runs upstairs. Charlie leaves closing the mysterious door, & goes upstairs only to hear a doorbell from the hotels suite, he walks to the door but realizes he forgot to grab his flashlight picks it up & finds his badge, suddenly he hears a second chime noisier then before he opens the door, he sees what looked like a siloutte of the two men in the window near the entrance, only to find it was Robert with a plate of cookies, ‚ÄúYou look like you saw a ghost,‚Äù Robert said, Charlie mumbles it was nothing, but questions why the cookies were here, then becomes hungry. ‚ÄúI just made some cookies for the big bake off this week,‚Äù he puts the plate down in the kitchen, ‚ÄúDid you ever find what you were looking for?‚Äù Yeah Charlie says, he came back to find his badge, & the two walk off into his car to talk about Charlies weird experience within the hotel. The two share a drink & drive off to a gas station fill up the car with gas a few blocks east and sit in the car. Charlie puts his hand over his head obviously struggling to sleep from the prior night but explains to Robert that he feels like he‚Äôs being followed. Robert looks concerned but says, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just tired man and from the looks of it haven‚Äôt slept well in a few days, you know I don‚Äôt believe in these wishy washy ghost stories, get some rest and call me tomorrow.‚Äù A concerned Charlie says he wants him to believe me, and asks for help, Robert sighs takes a moment finishes his drink and walks out of the car to pack up both their luggage, the two hug and agree to stay the night at Roberts house, then Robert says he can stay at my place for a bit‚Ä¶. but only if he helps with some errands, then they both walk off to the car leaving the gas station and start driving away to the house.

After the two reach Roberts house they park, and enter the house, afterwords Robert goes back to clean something out of his garage to remove unwanted things from a room, or closet, & gives Charlie his gun and says to be careful,¬†they then spent the weekend cleaning out the garage for a bit, Charlie takes a stool sits down and asks Robert about a book he found called the village of chapel vera, Robert pauses then says he‚Äôs never heard of that book before‚Ä¶, then Charlie looks and says its important to the case he is on, as he knows Robert had family from there, Robert stares and gets mad saying he never spoke to his family for several months reminding Charlie to not bring up that story as it was a sensitive topic, & Robert slams the door, Charlie gets up and the two pause with a distressed Robert, and Charlie apologizes for bringing up old wounds, they discuss other things and separate to clear the air, some time later the two men rest at Robert‚Äôs house after the long day they get a beer & sit down to eat. Later Charlie sleeps on the couch but has nightmares about the things he saw and the two men he was visited by, Charlie wakes up drinks some scotch then goes back to sleep. The next morning Charlie receives a letter from the caretaker who states he wants to have dinner with him to apologize for the mess at the hotel, a skeptical Charlie shows Robert the letter but Robert thinks it could be a trap, or some money laundering scam. Charlie finishes his breakfast but feels like he has to call his boss & explain that he may need a few more days to figure out whats going on with this case. Charlie hangs up the phone, but is still hungover from the night before stating he needs to get some coffee. He boils some water with the coffee machine, pours it then gets dressed and leaves Robert‚Äôs house stating he will only be a few hours.

1fwurhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/GutHealth/comments/1fwurhi/f31_i_have_to_eat_starchy_carbs_every_three_hours/,F[31] I have to eat starchy carbs every three hours or have intense stomach burning pain... I want to be free from constant carbs and junk food,"Hello!

I‚Äôm a 31-year-old female. I‚Äôve had stomach aches since I can remember, likely related to stress. In the last 4 years, my stomach issues have become worse and are definitely impacting my quality of life. Prior to this chapter, the stomach issues were certainly bothersome, but it didn‚Äôt keep me from doing normal activities. I‚Äôve seen a few specialists, which has helped, but I feel like there is more that I could be doing.

Basically, stress has changed my stomach, and now it feels like it is constantly producing a lot of acid. When I first wake up in the morning, I‚Äôm starving, nauseous, and it feels like acid is burning my stomach lining. Throughout the day, I must eat every 3 hours (4 at MAXIMUM). If I don‚Äôt, my stomach feels empty and I get that burning sensation again. I don‚Äôt necessarily feel hungry in these instances, just empty. It‚Äôs hard to explain. But if I don‚Äôt eat, the stomach ache becomes very painful. If I eat veggies, fruits, or protein without a starchy carb, I may no longer feel hunger, but the burning is still an issue. I HAVE to eat starchy carbs or else I will be in pain. I eat the other food groups simply because I know it is good for me, but truthfully, only carbs make my stomach feel okay. Usually it is bread, pasta, or a lot of rice, but fast food also does the trick, unfortunately. I also get stomach aches from: bell peppers especially raw, avocados, bananas (the worst stomach ache trigger), eggs (unless they are cooked into something), cucumbers, and coffee of course with the acidity.

I saw a nutritionist who ran some blood tests/saliva tests to see what kind of foods were inflammatory for me (I also have chronic neck pain). However, the list was so long that it was overwhelming, and it‚Äôs hard to get rid of things from your diet when you have never noticed a direct correlation to stomach aches. (I‚Äôm not saying it isn‚Äôt an important thing to do, just that it is hard.)

I went to a GI doctor that diagnosed me with functional dyspepsia (which basically means that he knows something is wrong, but doesn‚Äôt really have a better diagnosis). He prescribed a high dose of antacids (40mg 2x daily) and recommended that I take FDGard. I took the FDgard for a few months, but stopped because I didn‚Äôt notice any differences. I took that dose of antacids for 1-2 years, then decided to see what would happen if I cut back. I started taking just one pill in the morning and skipped the nightly dose. After some time, I started taking OTC antacids, 20mg in the morning. That is what I‚Äôm currently doing.¬†

7 years ago, I was 90% vegan for a year. I didn‚Äôt stress too much about accidental things and I definitely had a birthday meal with dairy products. But still, I reduced my animal product consumption enough to know that, while it may have helped a little, it wasn‚Äôt really impactful for my gut issues.

I‚Äôve been trying to reduce the stress in my life (with the goal of improving my gut health) for about 4 years. The biggest thing I did was start therapy and make some changes to my family dynamics. I learned new ways of communicating with my partner, discovered things about myself that explain a lottt, and I got a cat who brings me a lot of joy on a daily basis. I also learned more about my ADHD and how to cope.

I try to exercise, but it is difficult because I also have chronic neck pain (caused by a degenerative disc in my neck). I‚Äôm going to make a separate post about that for some advice. The more I exercise, the more it hurts, and it doesn‚Äôt seem to matter what I do. Anything that gets my heart rate up also exacerbates the pain.

I‚Äôm sure many of you can relate to my experience of sharing my stomach woes with people IRL and getting a lot of unsolicited advice. But someone did mention something that stuck with me‚Ä¶ Apparently there is some sort of bacteria that can grow in your stomach that feeds off of carbs, and some sort of drink can help get rid of it. They were clear that this is something done in a doctor‚Äôs office, not a home remedy thing. I tried looking into it, but came up with mostly results about how the microbiome reacts to carbs. Is that a thing anyone is familiar with? Or is that junk science?

Any advice is welcome. Have you had this issue? Have you heard of it? Do you have any ideas of what I can do to stop being so dependent on carbs?

I‚Äôm not happy. I‚Äôm sluggish and tired. I‚Äôve gained a lot of weight. I‚Äôve tried to lose some weight or even just maintain, but it is so hard when my only safe foods are basically sugar. I miss being active and spontaneous (or at least a bit more flexible). I‚Äôm beginning to feel desperate, but I don‚Äôt want to do anything unhealthy like a fad diet or buy some ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù product. I‚Äôve had some disordered eating habits before, so I want to have a healthy relationship with food and my body, but DAMN I NEED HELP.

(I take sertraline for anxiety‚Ä¶as a bonus, my GI said it has been shown to help reduce stomach issues too‚Ä¶, buspirone for depression, the 20mg antacid 30 minutes before first eating for the day, and Adderall on the weekdays for ADHD.)

TLDR; I need to eat starchy carbs every few hours, or the acid in my stomach builds up and I get a painful, burning feeling that can be debilitating. Antacids help, but I don‚Äôt want to rely on them for the rest of my life. Is anyone familiar with this kind of issue? Standard advice often cannot apply to my situation, so I‚Äôm looking for something that really relates to my issue.

My father was drunk most of the time.¬† He was a very abusive man, physically and mentally.¬† My mother didn‚Äôt drink a lot, but she took her frustrations out on me.  
  
‚ÄãI was always in trouble for something.¬† The rules in our home changed every day ‚Äì sometimes many times a day.¬† Consequently, I was always in trouble for something.¬† I would get a beating from Mom and then a worse one later from Dad.

I had been living with a woman for almost 20 years when I ended the relationship.¬† Life with her was good at first.¬† Then things started to get crazy and just kept getting crazier.¬† She had threatened to shoot me a couple of times.¬† I finally found the courage to tell her I did not want to be with her anymore.

I went in the house, found the number, and make the phone call.¬† I got an answering machine ‚Äì some would call me back as soon as possible.

To preface this post I just want to say I have been fat most of my life, ive been a pretty healthy weight only for about 4years in my life when I lost weight at 15 and reached about 132lbs, I did it blindly, not understanding calorie deficits, not counting calories just by eating what I found to be healthy and running before school. At around 19 I started rapidly gaining way geneally due to unmanaged ADHD and depression. 

(It will be a long read but I'll try to pack it to the brim with tips I have found that helped me lose weight and be happy with my diet)

This year for the first time ever I started to look into calorie deficits and counting calories,  I learned so much and I feel so much more conscious of food, I finally have a grasp on just how bad a lot of modern food is for us, how a pack of cookies doesn't go unnoticed by our bodies and even one cookie can take up a large portion of daily calories for someone my height. I now have a completely different outlook on snacks and junk food, I went into a rabbit hole of over processed food industry and I finally am not scared of diets. Just a year ago I remember crying Everytime I thought about having to go on a diet, crying about the obvious prognosis of developing diabetes due to my weight and family history, cried at the thought of having to give up the joy food gave me at the time (I bet a lot of people can relate to that).

  ""Like, what do you mean I won't ever be able to eat fast food or cookies!""
Now thinking back on it I feel so silly for what I thought. I have lost approximately 2 pounds per week since begining of May, did I give up all sweets and candies? No! Did I fully and forever give up fast food? Also no.
The key (one that works for me) I found to losing weight without losing my happiness and sanity is consciously making decisions about what I put in my body, researching healthy substitutes and evaluating what is worth it and what is not for me to consume. 
I used to drink a lot of coffee with milk and sugar, tea with sugar, sodas and juices. 
In my journey I found those are simply not worth it! Sugary drinks shouldn't be a way to hydrate my body!! It's insane that those snacks used to be the only way I put water in my body every single day. When learning about healthy diets and counting my calories I have realized those are not worth it. I dropped sodas, and made a decision to not turn to diet sodas containing aspartame (due to my migraines but something about aspartame doesn't sit right with me), instead the only fizzy drinks I indulge in now are only a few zero sugar drinks containing stevia and homemade lemonade with sparkling water and erythritol. I still drink tea and coffee, now with less milk and no sugar, just erythritol (which by the way is the best sweetener there is, tastes almost exactly like sugar). 

It might be shocking and controversial to some but since I started my weightloss journey I pretty consistently chose to have the same McDonald's meal every single Sunday. My Sunday consists of a morning coffee with milk and erythritol, a big Mac and large fries for dinner, and a MacDonald's salad with chicken and the sauce I found to be the least calories while being still really good, a 1000 island sauce. Sometimes I also treat myself to a McDonald's apple to have something sweet. 

Another important thing I learned while losing weight is the art of cooking for myself almost every day. For protein I mostly have chicken breast or ground turkey which is an amazing beef substitute. I use pure Avocado oil and only use 5 grams to fry my meats. I almost never have pasta or rice since usually its too much calories and not dense enough, I almost always have boiled potatoes (no butter, just salt) since they leave me full and don't contain too many calories. 

What made my diet really easy tho is something akin to Intermittent fasting, it's not fully it since after I wake up at 1pm, I do drink a small cup of coffee which contains 60calories, but after my coffee I don't eat anything and don't consume any calories till about 7pm, and since I usually go to sleep at about 4 am, I eat my supper at 10pm. This makes it so I can eat a bigger dinner, my most basic dinner for anyone interested usually looks like this:

200g of chicken breast
180g of potatoes
5g of avocado oil
+
Whatever salad/vegetables I crave that day

I consume anything between 800-1200 calories a day, I usually aim for 1000 calories, then on my McDonald's Sundays I go up to 1400 calories.

In my deficit I take into account that I also don't currently exercise, I struggle with motivation, and leaving the house due to bad social anxiety, I have a very sedentary lifestyle for now, but I'm going back to gym next month which will allowed me to go up in calories. 

To summarize, I am loving my diet because it's fun, allows me to try new things to find low calorie substitutes for food and drinks I love, I am able to indulge in any food, I feel great and happy. It's only year one of my journey and once I lose all the weight I need, my goal will change from focusing on hitting a deficit to actually developing a better relationship with food so I can drop more of the fast food, but for now it's what works for me.

My wife loves to do things on Saturday mornings, but I hate it. I feel like I can‚Äôt leave until I‚Äôve had coffee and a chance for my meds to kick in. Sometimes I won‚Äôt leave until I‚Äôve had a chance to go to the bathroom too if my stomach feels torn up.

She‚Äôs pregnant and lately has been asking me to do things I don‚Äôt usually do more often. For example: making her breakfast, foot massages, her side of chores, etc.

I am trying to pick up the slack ‚Äòcause I have no idea how it feels to be pregnant. Got her a pregnancy pillow and have been making her breakfast have done a foot massage with hot oil.

This morning I woke up to make her breakfast, but while I was in the middle of making it (just oatmeal and toast) she woke up and asked if we could go to a diner. I was very dismissive and told her she could go. I had already made her coffee. 

My refusal to go upset her. I can be a bit of an ass when I feel like there‚Äôs an immediate change in what I‚Äôve planned.

This isn‚Äôt always the case. Just sometimes. I‚Äôve gotten up early with her many times to do all sorts of things and have enjoyed it. Some days though I just don‚Äôt want to be around people. It‚Äôs often enough though that she is upset by it.

I am trying to do things I don‚Äôt like to do more often as it will help me get over them, but I dropped the ball this morning and she left angry to go to the diner.

Any of you experience stuff like this and have you overcome it?

I hate being a liability to my wife. I want to be Prince Charming. That‚Äôs what she deserves. Unfortunately I can only hit that 1/3 times. Advice on being a better partner?

From keto to intermittent fasting, it felt like nothing fit into my lifestyle. That's when I stumbled across the 21-Day Smoothie Diet by Drew Sgoutas.

I was hesitant at first. I mean, another ""magic fix""? I‚Äôd seen them all. But the approach felt different from the start. The Smoothie Diet wasn‚Äôt about cutting out entire food groups or depriving myself. It was simple: replace a couple of meals each day with nutrient-packed smoothies, focus on whole foods, and give my body the fuel it needed.

**Starting the Journey**

But before I dove in, I did what any sensible person should do ‚Äî I consulted with my doctor. Having a history of high blood pressure, I didn‚Äôt want to mess things up. My doctor actually encouraged me to give it a try but reminded me to keep an eye on things like sodium and sugar levels, especially since some fruit-based smoothies can be high in natural sugars.

That conversation with my doctor was a game-changer. It made me realize that although these smoothies are packed with good stuff, health is not a one-size-fits-all solution. I‚Äôd recommend that anyone considering a major dietary change, especially those with existing health issues like diabetes or gastrointestinal conditions, do the same. In fact, Drew‚Äôs plan even encourages this.

**Prepping and Planning**

Once I got the green light, the first thing I did was purchase the 21-Day Smoothie Diet Plan. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect much from an e-book, but I was pleasantly surprised at how detailed it was. The recipes were easy to follow, and the shopping lists? Lifesavers! You don‚Äôt realize how important they are until you‚Äôre in the grocery store trying to remember if you‚Äôve already bought enough spinach or if you still need to grab that almond milk.

[21-Day Smoothie Diet](https://preview.redd.it/8ri26xu6pxsd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2200ac3cb5d43fe1ee33ea05e35c94dfe5e43ab2)

Each week, I‚Äôd go through the recipes and pick out the ones that looked the most appetizing ‚Äî and I‚Äôm not going to lie, it was fun experimenting. Mango and pineapple smoothies? Yes, please! I even tried mixing spinach, avocado, and almond milk ‚Äî surprisingly, it was delicious!

I was also introduced to ingredients like chia seeds, spirulina, and acai, which I had never used before. These ‚Äúsuperfoods‚Äù not only added new flavors but also boosted the nutritional value of the smoothies. I felt like I was drinking meals that were actually good for me, not just a cup of blended fruits and vegetables.

**The 21-Day Routine**

The first few days were hard. I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat it. Transitioning from my usual breakfast of toast and coffee to a smoothie packed with kale, bananas, and almond butter wasn‚Äôt easy. But as the days passed, I started feeling different ‚Äî lighter, more energized. I wasn‚Äôt dragging myself through the day like I usually did.

Meal prepping became my secret weapon. On Sundays, I‚Äôd make sure everything was portioned out and ready for the week. This took the stress out of my mornings, making it much easier to stick to the plan. And that‚Äôs one of the reasons why I think this diet is so effective. It‚Äôs not just about what you‚Äôre eating but about creating habits that make healthy choices easier.

In addition to smoothies, I included snacks like raw veggies, hummus, nuts, and seeds, which were recommended. These high-fiber snacks kept me full in between meals, preventing me from reaching for that candy bar I knew I didn‚Äôt need.

**Results**

By the end of the 21 days, I had lost 8 pounds. That‚Äôs right, 8 pounds in just three weeks. But the weight loss wasn‚Äôt even the best part ‚Äî it was how I felt. I wasn‚Äôt bloated anymore, my skin was clearer, and I just felt better. I even started to notice that my cravings for junk food had decreased.

This wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúdiet‚Äù in the traditional sense, where you feel like you‚Äôre constantly battling hunger or depriving yourself. It was a lifestyle change, a way of eating that made sense for me. I learned to listen to my body and what it needed, which, surprisingly, wasn‚Äôt cookies or chips, but nutrients that I had been missing.

**Tips for Success**

If you're considering trying the Smoothie Diet, here are a few things I learned along the way:

Experiment with Recipes: Don‚Äôt be afraid to try different combinations of fruits, vegetables, and superfoods. You‚Äôll be surprised at what you might enjoy.

Healthy Snacks: Incorporating snacks like nuts, veggies, and whole-grain crackers keeps you from getting too hungry between smoothies. This is crucial to staying on track.

Hydration: Don‚Äôt forget to drink water. I made it a habit to have a glass of water before and after my smoothies to stay hydrated. I even started adding lemon or cucumber slices to my water for extra flavor.

Listen to Your Body: If you‚Äôre feeling tired or sluggish, it might be time to adjust your portions or ingredients. Pay attention to how different smoothies make you feel.

**Is It Worth It?**

Absolutely. The Smoothie Diet by Drew Sgoutas might not be for everyone, but for me, it was a refreshing way to kickstart a healthier lifestyle without feeling like I was giving up the foods I loved. It helped me establish a routine, control my cravings, and most importantly, it gave me results.

I still incorporate smoothies into my diet now, even after the 21 days, and I‚Äôm mindful of what I eat. It‚Äôs not about perfection but balance ‚Äî something this plan helped me understand. **To know further check Smoothie Diet's official website:**¬†[https://smoothiediet.com/](https://freezegluco.com/SmoothieDiet.html)

So, if you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs been struggling with finding a diet that works, especially if you live a busy lifestyle like me, I‚Äôd say give this a shot. Just make sure you check in with your doctor and prepare to be amazed at how good you can feel when you give your body the nutrients it‚Äôs been craving all along.

This morning I brewed a Odacio 230 ml pod and got the same approximately 190ml of coffee, so I decided to try brewing it again through the same used pod and got the correct 230ml ammount !?!?!?  

Does anyone have any idea why this would be happening ? 
  Like why am I not getting the correct amount of coffee through new pods and only when I brew through a used pod, does it actually brew properly !? 

Support was trying to get me to send my machine away for repair which would take a minimum of 3 weeks where I am in Canada, but I insisted that they either send me a new machine or send me one to use in the meantime and they agreed. 
So I have a loaner machine on its way to me so that I at least have something while this one is being repaired..

1fwu78p,https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1fwu78p/postpartum_doula_for_clinical_experience/,Postpartum Doula for Clinical Experience,"Hello! 

I am looking into clinical experiences for medical school admissions. I am very interested in OBGYN or Peds so something involving babies and/or birth seemed like a great fit for me. I've been unable to find this in my area for the common ways people typically get clinical experience (CNA programs are impossible timing-wise and positions that align with my interests are reserved for experienced CNAs or PCTs, MA programs are around 4-9 months in my area, EMT doesn't interest me, must be a CNA to be a PCT in my state.) 

So, my question is, would a postpartum doula fit the requirement for clinical experience? I would take a course for knowledge (https://luminouspostpartum.com/) and proceed to a certification route through DONA!  I'd love to get into births but as a full-time student I don't see myself being able to be on call for births as of now, and I don't believe any hospitals in my area take shifts or volunteer doulas. Here is an outline of what postpartum doulas do if anyone isn't familiar with the role (just from google lol)

* **Emotional support** doulas provide a nonjudgmental space for families to express their concerns and emotions.¬†They can help alleviate feelings of anxiety and isolation.¬†
* **Mental health support** doulas can educate families on postpartum mental health and help them identify early warning signs for mental health disorders.¬†They can also refer families to mental health professionals and community programs.¬†
* **Physical support** doulas can help with physical recovery from childbirth and provide opportunities for rest and personal care.¬†
* **Infant care** Doulas can demonstrate newborn care, assist with breastfeeding, and answer questions about the baby's needs.¬†They can also help create charts for feeding, sleeping, and other activities.¬†
* **Household support** doulas can help with light housework, such as taking out the garbage, wiping counters, and making coffee.¬†

AGARO IS 2K 
KALDI IS 1.4K

Fast forward 7 years of not having any contact whatsoever we are now both 25 and we randomly met in a boardgame evening via shared friends. Talked a little and updated ourselves on each other's life. Was a really nice vibe.

I picked up the opportunity and texted her the next morning. Been texting her for a few days and then asked her out for a midday coffee (she study and works in a conservatory and I work at a bank, building 700 meters from each other).

She accepted, and then the trouble comes.

First deal was to meet on last Thursday at 2pm (during my lunch break) but she couldn't make it due to a colleagues of hers being sick and cover her shift (teaching one extra hour). So she proposed to meet on Friday (yesterday) with the same plans, I accepted but Fridays in banks are quite busy and I had to ditch the appointment (should have know, my bad).

After finishing work yesterday I sent her a vocal message saying that I was very sorry and meeting up was being harder than expected, yet I really wanted to see her but I am in no hurry since I get that both of us have full schedules. She hasn't responded. And no further plans were set.

Given that I really like her, should I ask her out again or wait out some time?

It‚Äôs not the kind where my oxygen goes dangerously low but it‚Äôs enough to be diagnosable.  (I am getting a sleep appliance.  I actually just have to pick it up from the dentist)

I also have ADHD in case that‚Äôs relevant.

And my doctors are aware so I‚Äôm not looking for medical advice, just seeking to understand and maybe know if anybody else experiences this.

For as long as I remember, no matter how much sleep I get when I wake up I feel exhausted and want to go back to sleep.  During the week, I get 8-9 hours of sleep, wake up exhausted but after a cup or two of coffee and about an hour of being awake I feel like a person.  So I‚Äôm kind of going against what my body is asking for, but I HAVE to get up so I do.

On the weekends, I usually end up sleeping about 10 hours.  I get up because it‚Äôs better to.  My kid wants me to be awake and I don‚Äôt want to be a ‚Äústay in bed mom‚Äù. Then it‚Äôs the same thing where I‚Äôm exhausted and it takes about an hour to wake up.

On occasion, I indulge my desire to keep sleeping.  After about 12 hours, I‚Äôm still tired but not exhausted and unable to fall back to sleep.  On these occasions I have a sleep hangover (I don‚Äôt drink at all, but I used to drink and it‚Äôs the same feeling minus the vomiting).  Basically despite all my sleep I‚Äôm still tired, my head hurts, I‚Äôm slightly unsteady on my feet, and it takes 2-3 hours to feel normal.

This is of course a deterrent.  I lose a good chunk of my day because I slept away a good portion of it and then I‚Äôm sick for a good portion of it.

My question is why does this happen?  Why does my body ask for sleep it doesn‚Äôt need and then where do those symptoms come from?

I also don‚Äôt think the sleeping is related to Depression- I do take medicine for Depression but I‚Äôve been in therapy and I would say I‚Äôm pretty happy in my life, often feel gratitude and appreciation.

I have a unique shaped main living space that has evolved multiple times since I moved in and no matter what I try I cannot seem to get the layout right. I just don‚Äôt know what furniture I need or how to lay it out. 

In the image you see the front door opens to a fairly large space on the right that was staged as a ‚Äúdining‚Äù area when I bought the house. Left of the door is stairs that go to a landing, then further left is stairs going to our rec. room. The kitchen counter ‚Äúwraps‚Äù around at a weird angle. On the far side of the kitchen is another space that was staged as a small ‚Äúliving room‚Äù. Under the stairs is a pantry. The bay windows are about 18 in from the floor and I don‚Äôt want anything covering them as I need the natural light for my plants.

Some thoughts
1) no formal dining space is necessary 
2) bookcase
3) coffee station, right now it‚Äôs on the back of the kitchen counter opposite the back door
4) movement through the space from/to doors is important as I have kids/pets that travel through this space a lot
5) green sofa is a placeholder for a large dark brown leather sofa, just to show scale.

I‚Äôm looking for a reality check (good or bad) on our discretionary spend budget. We live in a VERY high cost of living area but make good money, $395,000 combined. All in our monthly housing expenses are $6500 of our monthly gross or 32% (higher than i would like but we bought last year at the height of the rate hike because we were having a second baby) and our new daycare costs are $5435 and make up about 27%. We have $1100 in student loans, a $460 interest free heat loan, a $483 car payment, and then all the other run of the mill life costs‚Äîcable, utilities, life insurance, car gas, commuting expenses, groceries, pets, ymca membership etc. after taking in to account all of our fixed expenses we have $2500 a month in truly discretionary spending for things like clothes, going out to eat, coffee, babysitters etc. We have a healthy investment portfolio, savings, and both contribute up to the match in retirement‚Äî3% for me and 4% for him. We made improvements on our house and a recent appraisal has it worth at almost $300k more than what we spent on it last year.

This morning was too beautiful of a day to not head out for a ride - so I decided I should head out and try [Asmara Coffee House](https://www.asmaracoffeehouse.com/), [located ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fSHq1c5g73uzLRra9)right along York Street.

Cycling wise it was a very pleasant ride up, using both the TVP and the bike infrastructure all the way along Dundas. Asmara has 2 hitching posts alongside York, which are visible while inside the cafe to keep a watchful eye on your ride (which I did notice lots of stolen bikes around the area so that was very welcomed).

Photography wise - unless you really like U-HAUL and other industrial buildings there isn‚Äôt much else out here, minus the train outside the [Western Fair District Market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zT39fJtYipCnGXDo6) which is pretty cool!

Coffee wise - this is the first cup that made me internally say ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù. The blend they use is strong, more so on the bitter end which is my preference, but then there is this amazing fruity undertone‚Ä¶ I normally hate fruity notes within my coffee due to them learning towards the more acidic side but this - I needed to buy a bag right away. They also served it in the traditional glass mug and had beautiful latte art heart so presentation wise it‚Äôs an A+. The Cortado comes in at $4 which I think is a very fair price (did I mention that they roast their own beans??)

So if it wasn‚Äôt obvious already - no I couldn‚Äôt make a coffee at home as good as this one, but with their beans I‚Äôm going to try my best to replicate it! Will definitely be making more trips out here.

I also wanted to come out here due to [The Squeaky Wheel Bike Shop](https://www.londoncyclelink.ca/squeakywheel) being so close by which was really neat and friendly! They helped me swapped out my seats quick releae bolt for standard one (dont want anyone yanking my seat!) - and I will deffintely come by to turn my dads old bike into a friction-shifing communter!

Good morning all,

Just to preface, I am an espresso novice. My at home machine is an as of now unmodified gagia classic pro, and I‚Äôm having trouble getting shots to pull for long enough. I‚Äôm using the fellow opus grinder, and with the Porta filter and basket that came with the machine I was able to get some decently timed shots, consistently getting 18g in to 40g out (my preferred ratio) at 25 seconds, though even then I had the grinder set at 1, with the inner ring still set in the middle. However, I just bought a bottomless Porta filter with a 18 gram basket, and at the absolute finest setting on the grinder my espresso is pulling 40g in about 16-17 seconds. I noticed today during my prep that my shower screen isn‚Äôt channeling water right, with most of it coming out of the sides rather than through the screen itself (if it makes any difference, I am using a puck screen, and still having this issue.)

My beans were roasted a couple of weeks ago, I evenly distributed using a blind shaker and wdt tool, and I used precisely 18g of coffee in the 18g basket. The only thing I can think of is perhaps the shower screen isn‚Äôt creating enough resistance to get the right pressure? Maybe it‚Äôs the grinder? I‚Äôve had it about a year, using it once or twice a week (I don‚Äôt pre-grind obviously, just don‚Äôt make my own espresso that often) and outside of regular cleaning haven‚Äôt done any other maintenance. Again, I‚Äôm still learning, so any advice would be appreciated.",1,1728144756.0,espresso,3,1.0,False
