Visiting Mexico City this week and looking forward to the food. I know there are tons of vegan restaurants to try and we have a good list of those for lunch/dinner. 

I’m wondering about breakfast specifically, what is the best way to order a latte with oat milk or non dairy milk? According to Google Translate it would be “puedes preparar café con leche con leche de avena?” Is this a common way to ask for it and is oat milk common or is a different type of non dairy milk easier to come by? 

Secondly, we will be leaving before sunrise for several day excursions so I want to be prepared with breakfast/lunch I can pack with me since I may not be able to find vegan option at places like xochimilco and the teotihuacan temples- what is my best option? Pick up supplies to make pb&j at a grocery store or is there a common type of bread or pastry that’s vegan and would be easy to find and pack with me the night before or early in the morning?

1pyzp07,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaladaptiveDreaming/comments/1pyzp07/how_i_cured_my_severe_addiction_to_maladaptive/,“How I cured my severe addiction to Maladaptive Daydreaming” —an update,"Hello all. 
A couple years ago, I shared to the group a lengthy personal essay on my experience with maladaptive daydreaming and the steps I took to quit. 

It got quite the attention in this group, and apparently many found it helpful. 

A couple months ago, I decided to delete the post for 2 reasons:

1.) A desire to close this chapter of my life. 

2.) It became quite overwhelming— I have received hundreds and hundreds of DMs from people who read my post and wanted to reach out. The majority of these DMs came from teenagers and other very young people, many of whom (from my perspective) were not in the best place mentally & were approaching me out of desperation. I felt an obligation to respond to most of these DMs and offer a few brief words of encouragement. However, it became extremely emotionally taxing, especially because there were many people who reached out that needed (in my opinion) more advanced help that only a trained mental health professional could provide. 

Since deleting, I have continued to receive DMs, but now they’re from people wondering where my post went and explaining how much it helped them. I was able to find a saved copy on my laptop, so I figured if it was still helping people, it would be a little selfish to not re-upload. It won’t be as visually appealing as my original post (I didn’t save the original format) but all the words are there! 

Just a few quick reminders this go-around:
1.) If you are wanting to reach out to me, please know that I probably won’t be checking my DMs very frequently, if at all. 
2.) I am NOT a mental health professional. I wrote this essay to share my personal story & list techniques that helped me. My essay should not be used as a substitute for seeking therapy or other psychiatric help. 

Also, yes!! I still am “clean” from MD. Since creating my initial post, I was accepted into graduate school. I’m starting my 4th semester in a few weeks and will graduate in 2027. Not only is it possible to quit MDD, but life gets so much better when you do. 
           
          
          
            

My original post: 



Hello everyone. I am 24F, & have been a silent observer in this amazing group for many years. I finally  believe it is time to share my story, and maybe offer some advice for anyone who has a desire to stop maladaptive daydreaming. This will be extremely long (I’ve had months to work on what I was going to say), so I’m going to separate it into sections so you can read what you personally feel you need, or so someone can read what they can, step away from it, and easily find their spot if they choose to return to it at a later time. If absolutely nobody reads my post, that’s okay. Taking the time to write this has felt extremely cathartic, and it finally feels like I can close this chapter for good.
              
             
               
               

A little about me:

(BTW—throughout my post, the abbreviation “MD” stands for Maladaptive Daydream[ing])

Since I was about 10 years old, I have spent a large portion of my life Maladaptive Daydreaming.

I have had 4 or 5 major storylines that I’ve progressed through as I have gotten older. I find myself referring to these major storylines as the “episodes” of my life, because each has lasted about 2-3 years, and every major storyline was extremely relevant to my age, what was happening during that time, my biggest anxieties & insecurities, and my personal goals at the time.

I don’t think it’s necessary to give specifics about each storyline, but a few major themes were consistent and present in all of them: in every storyline, I was the center of the universe. I was always me, but I transformed myself into a grandiose character that had fame, fortune & incredible talent. I was quick witted, confident & brilliant, often being the expert or #1 person in a particular career/hobby. I was always thin & exquisitely beautiful. In every storyline, everyone desired me or wanted to be me. At least one bad event would happen in each plot, where I [my character] would fall apart, but ultimately be able to be their own hero and heal.

Each plot had 20+ side characters that had emotional depth, their own detailed lives, and their own personal story on how they were connected to me. I can’t put a number on time spent daydreaming, such as, “I spent an average of *insert number* hours a day MD,” because it was always kind of there. I would just adjust how absorbed I was in my fantasy depending on what I had to do in the moment. These levels consisted anywhere from “I’m completely present in my body and am not thinking about my other reality,” to “I am still present, but I have my other fantasy world in the back of my head” to “I am completely immersed in my MD.” I would weave in and out of these levels daily depending on how present *I* needed to be at the time.

Throughout my life, I was still able to complete certain milestones. I didn’t shut myself out completely from the world; I would go through life in a way that kept me moderately successful, but when I did tasks, I would do it in the mindset of my MD character. If the task wasn’t something my character would be doing, I would mindlessly finish the tasks while having a different scenario in my head.

Additionally, besides my major storylines, I would have the more common daydreaming. If I saw a cool TikTok or saw someone else do something interesting or heroic, I would have quick ~1hr daydreaming sessions about what I would do if I was the one who was in that scenario.




 

Reasons why I decided to stop:

Firstly, from monitoring this group for a while, I understand that there are many people who have no desire to stop maladaptive daydreaming. I am not telling anyone that they should stop if they don’t want to, but here are my personal reasons for needing to stop:

-My real life never measured up 

Because I always made my MD character and life so extremely amazing and untouchable, there was no way that my real self could ever measure up. I would never be as beautiful or skinny. I would never have as much money. I would never be as confident. I would never be as successful. Ect.

Not only that, but real people are different from those we make up in our heads, because humans are imperfect. I felt like the real people in my social circle never measured up to the ones I created in my head. I couldn’t hold onto romantic partners, because they were never as great as my imaginary boyfriends. My family & friends were dull compared to the ones I created in my stories. MD gave me so much dopamine, that my real life felt dull and un-stimulating.

During those lucid moments after coming back into the real world after a long period of immersive MD, I was so depressed at how my real life was. It was more interesting to spend my free time in my made-up utopia than it was to participate in the mundane tasks that my real life required.

-Time Wasted 

I cannot even explain how much time I wasted because of MD. Some days, it feels like I was 10 years old, blinked, and suddenly became a 24 year old adult.

I was never present in my important life milestones. I daydreamed through 4 years of college at my dream university, choosing to spend most of my free time alone in my room daydreaming, rather than going out and spending time with friends. I daydreamed through once in a lifetime vacations. I would decline the majority of event invites, because I would rather be by myself and my daydreams. Whenever I was in public, I couldn’t wait to be back home alone so I could start MD again.

I spent my teens and early 20s, arguably some of the most formative and exciting years of one’s life, primarily alone and daydreaming about being someone I was not. I knew that if I didn’t stop, I would once again blink and suddenly be in my 80s or 90s, with my biggest regret being that I never went out and actually lived.

⁠-Executive Dysfunction/Procrastination

Like many of you, I have inattentive ADHD and struggle with executive functioning. ADHD+Maladaptive Daydreaming=Procrastination Hell.

Oh, how I procrastinated! A simple 10 minute task would take me HOURS to finally initiate and complete. After all, what’s more fun: cleaning your room, or daydreaming that you’re the greatest person in the world?

This was absolutely detrimental in college. Anything that required my full attention & couldn’t be done passively (studying, assignments, attending classes/office hours, ect) was pushed to the backburner or completely ignored because of my MD. In classes that should’ve been easy As (basically just turn in the assignments and attend class) I performed poorly, all because I forgot to complete the assignments or waited until the last minute to do it. I found myself constantly making excuses to my professors about my performance. Instead of changing my behavior, I would just drop a rigorous class to have even more free time to daydream.

I graduated last year with a STEM degree at a top 20 university. My gpa was a 2.97.

If I did not procrastinate by spending so much time maladaptive daydreaming, I suspect that my gpa could’ve easily been in the 3.5 range or higher. With my career desires, it is necessary to get a 4 year graduate degree.. I currently have no chance of getting into graduate school with my undergrad GPA, so my life has been put on a standstill. I currently have a 4 year bachelors degree that is absolutely worthless. While I watch my friends begin grad school, get engaged, or start their careers, I have had to spend this year undoing the damage that maladaptive daydreaming caused to my life. Instead of being accepted into graduate school, I now have to spend 1-3 years building up my work experience in entry level jobs related to my future career, and studying for the entrance exam to *hopefully* make a high enough score that my undergrad gpa will be overlooked. And that still might not be enough to make up for the damage MD has done.





HOW I STOPPED MALADAPTIVE DAYDREAMING

Now, I am going to list the steps I took to stop daydreaming. This was not an overnight process. This was over 6 months of putting forth CONSTANT effort to change one of the biggest aspects of my life. Some days were harder than others, and I had a lot of failures, especially in the beginning.

Step 1:Recognize that your maladaptive daydreaming is an addiction that needs be stopped.

This was in the very beginning of this process. I spent a lot of time on the internet looking at advice on how to stop. I looked through reddit posts in this group and others, where members who were also trying to stop would post daily updates on how it was going. During my research, I found the essay “Guide to Maladaptive Daydreaming: Overcoming fantasy addiction.” https://maladaptivedaydreamingguide.wordpress.com/2015/04/04/part-i-fantasy-and-fall-of-the-self/

I know this is a pretty popular article in this group, but if you are wanting to quit MD and have not read it, read it asap. This article was single-handedly the biggest wake up call I have ever had. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything that was so specific to my life. It absolutely hit me like a freight train. The first time I read it, I was crying by the end. The article talks a lot about “the egoless mind,” and really put something into perspective: I was spending so much time perfecting an imaginary world and living through imaginary characters, instead of taking that time to perfect myself. I was making my imaginary persona powerful and successful when I could’ve been making myself powerful and successful. I put so much effort into creating my ideal version of myself with absolutely nothing to show for it in real life.

I printed out the article. I read it multiple times a day, highlighting super powerful passages and really digesting the material. It was then that I finally admitted to myself that I had an addiction, and like many other addictions, if I did not fix it, my life would continue to go nowhere.

Step 2: Talk to someone and get help

This can be done in many ways. Because I have ADHD and also struggle with anxiety and depression, I already had a relationship with a psychiatrist that I saw regularly. I had never admitted my addiction to her or anyone else. When I finally had the courage to tell her what I was struggling with and how drastically it was affecting my life, she said “okay yes, that actually makes a lot of sense,” with absolutely no judgement, and immediately helped me get to work! First, she put me back on all my medications. I have taken my ADHD stimulant for many years, but I have been on and off an SNRI for my anxiety/depression. She put me back on my SNRI because she anticipated that me not having my usual coping mechanism had the potential to put me in a dark place. Next, she referred me to a therapist who really worked with me to uncover why I was so fond of Maladaptive Daydreaming, and served as a weekly accountability coach.

Now, I understand that access to mental healthcare is a HUGE privilege in this world, and seeking professional help is not an option for many. There is still support out there! Look through this group at peoples’ success stories. Find or form a discord server chat with other members who want to quit. I saw a TikTok about maladaptive daydreaming that had over A MILLION LIKES! There were thousands of comments saying things like “omg, I’ve been doing this for years and I thought I was the only one,” or “I desperately need to stop, but I don’t know how.” There are SO MANY PEOPLE who struggle with this! Form a friendship with someone who is also struggling, and become each other’s accountability partner. Check in on each other everyday. Cheer for each others progress, and be there in support during the bad days. Knowing that you aren’t the only one who struggles with this, as well as forming a support system, is huge  in the recovery process.

Step 3: Look back at the fantasy worlds you created throughout your life. Spend time remembering your most important characters, and take a moment to thank them all profusely.

I realize that I have spent a large amount of time in this post blaming MD for most of my problems, but let me make something clear: Maladaptive Daydreaming unequivocally saved my life. When I initially began MD, I was a 10 year old little girl who was struggling with anxiety and panic attacks. I was terrified of the world, and I was also incredibly lonely. MD helped me escape the real world and transport to a place where I had friends and lots of exciting adventures. It suddenly didn’t matter that I didn’t have a lot of real friends, or that I was stuck in a boring town & felt like there was no way out; all I had to do was listen to music and I could instantly daydream a world where everything was perfect.

It’s obvious that nobody spends a large amount of their life daydreaming if they are 100% happy with their own life. From what I have read online and what my medical professionals have told me, most people who develop MD do so as a way to escape their own reality, which may be mundane, traumatic or full of sadness. When you think about it, HOW AMAZING IS IT that we are able to come up with daydreams that are so colorful and detailed, that we can entertain ourselves for hours?!?? At the end of the day, Maladaptive Daydreaming isn’t a horrible and cruel activity! It’s an ability that your brain allowed you to do in order to keep you alive. After all— it is better to be on this earth in a constant daydream than to have made the choice to no longer be on this earth entirely. And so for that, I thank MD. The escape that I received from MD kept me alive during the darkest periods of my life. However, it’s time for me to take back the reins and continue this life in my real reality.

Step 4: Get rid of your headphones and limit music time

I know, it’s hard. But if you really want to stop maladaptive daydreaming, you gotta get rid of your headphones. Put your headphones or earbuds away in a drawer or high up on a bookshelf; anywhere where you cannot see them. For a lot of people with MD, including myself, music is the gateway to slipping into hours of daydreaming. I spent almost every waking moment of my day with at least one earbud in listening to music, and that was pretty much my demise. If you are a lover of music like myself and are scared you won’t be able to enjoy it anymore without headphones, don’t worry! I purchased a high-end speaker that I listen to music on. I found that using a speaker instead of headphones allowed me to still enjoy music, but in a way that kept me in this reality and didn’t allow me to slip into my MD storyline. I have to say, listening to music while I am still completely present in my body has made music SO MUCH BETTER! Instead of finding the loudest music or constantly listening to the same songs over and over, I now spend time discovering new music that I fully appreciate. It also makes listening to music way more of a treat; since I don’t have constant access to it, when I actually allow myself music time, it has become an intentional experience instead of a passive one.

If you aren’t ready to ditch the earbuds entirely, make your listening experience way less appealing. For most of the day, swap out your amazing Bose or AirPods for a crappy $5 pair of earbuds. Set an hour time limit on your Apple Music or Spotify account. Instead of turning on your favorite playlist, listen to a podcast or audiobook.

Step 5: Learn what it means to be bored. Be comfortable sitting in silence

During my first week of stopping MD, I stumbled upon a crazy problem: I had no idea how to handle boredom!! For most of my life, whenever I had even a minute of free time, I would instantly slip into daydreaming and be able to immediately entertain myself. I had NEVER experienced boredom! Without MD, I now had HOURS of every day that I needed to fill. On day 4, I spent the whole day cleaning my entire apartment spotless. Let me repeat that: Me, someone with severe ADHD and horrible Executive Dysfunction, was SO BORED that I now viewed CLEANING as a fun activity! That is a crazy and hilarious concept. So yes, you will be bored. However, it is okay to be bored. Do not let boredom give you an excuse to daydream.

Additionally, because I was no longer using earbuds 24/7, I learned yet another crazy fact: I had never existed in silence. I have always had music or some kind of video constantly playing in my ear via my earbuds. Every single task needed to be done to music. If I needed to put my clothes in the laundry, I needed to listen to music. If I was walking around the grocery store, I needed to listen to music. Hell, I needed music to walk 10 steps from my front door to my car! It took me a long time to be comfortable sitting in silence. I learned that the real world can be awfully quiet, and that sometimes made me sad. During those times, I would make sure to not be alone. I would go over to my mom’s house or FaceTime a friend. I learned how to meditate. I would sometimes hum my own songs or start tapping my feet to fill up the silence.

I feel like I should definitely say this: if you have never existed in silence, it can at first be a dark or depressing experience. If the silence leads to you having dark thoughts, don’t sit alone and let those thoughts become louder!! Do not do it. Reach out to a friend or family member. Go to a library or coffee shop and be around the hustle and bustle of the public. Create a post in this group sharing your feelings and read the comments of acknowledgment and support. Do not let your thoughts convince you to do something horrible. You are an amazing human being with incredible value to this world, and THIS FEELING WILL PASS!!!

Step 6: Find new hobbies, “just say ‘Yes,’” and fake it ‘till you make it!

So, you have decided to stop daydreaming. You now have hours upon hours of free time a day. What are you supposed to do now?

First, do whatever you can to not spend hours scrolling on your phone. Set time limits for your screen time, and log out of social media apps if you have to.

Find hobbies that you enjoy that allow you to have fun, AND requires you to socialize face to face with people. I guarantee there are ENDLESS activities in your area; all you have to do is go out and find them. Look at what activities are happening at your public library or local bookstore. Check Facebook for local events. Sign up for a membership at a gym. Learn a sport. Find a non-profit to volunteer at. Join a book club. Join a dating app and meet people for drinks. The possibilities are endless! This was a very hard thing for me to do, as I am normally pretty shy and introverted. The first step is the hardest part.

I joined a local dog agility club, and have enjoyed working with my dog and teaching her how to perform in agility competitions. I took adult swim lessons and learned how to play Pickleball. I enrolled in a graduate school entrance exam course, where I study virtually with my classmates all over the country. Just because you try something doesn’t have to mean that you’ll do it forever. You’ll most likely try a hobby that you absolutely hate (*cough cough* the 5k jogging club *cough cough*). That’s part of the process! You will quickly find activities that you enjoy and look forward to doing.

Now, what should you do when you have an opportunity to attend something that you’re feeling “meh” about? Go do it. My therapist and I call this the “Just say ‘Yes’ Philosophy”. If an old friend invites you to dinner, say yes. If someone you met at one of your new hobbies asks you to meet up, say yes. If you get invited to a friend’s wedding, say yes. If there’s a birthday party, say yes. If a friend asks you to come over to sit on the couch with them and do absolutely nothing, say yes. If your neighbor asks for help to assemble an Ikea shelf in exchange for pizza and beer, say yes. Are you seeing a pattern here? As maladaptive daydreamers, we have conditioned ourselves to always deny invites to events or activities because we would rather spend all our time alone with our daydreams. Learn to break out of this habit. Take every opportunity to develop and/or strengthen as many relationships as you can.

Lastly, there are going to be times when you want to decline an opportunity to slip back into isolation. Even if you “just say ‘Yes,’” you might find that while you’re at the event, you’re not having fun and are counting down the minutes until you can leave. That is when you fake it ‘till you make it! Tell yourself, “yeah, this kind of sucks, but at least I’m not alone and laying in bed.” I hate when people say to just “slap a smile on your face,” but really, just do it. Tell yourself that you’re having a decent time. Don’t let a bad or boring experience ruin social outings for you. In those dull moments, remind yourself that even though you aren’t having the greatest time, you are a sentient human being surrounded by other sentient human beings who all came together to share an experience, and that in itself is a beautiful thing.

Step 7: Write down your maladaptive daydreams in a journal. Take time to say goodbye.

This was a very cathartic experience that would sometimes make me laugh, smile, cry, or all of the above at the same time. Buy a journal or open a word document on your phone or laptop, and write down everything you can think of about your daydreams. Write about your character. What did she/he/they look like? What were your favorite qualities about your character? List as many activities and adventures you and your character went on. Talk about the world that your daydreams took place in. Look back at all the important side characters, and include what their role was in this incredible world you created for yourself.

I personally looked back at my last 2 major MD storylines, and typed out as much as I could think of about them. If I randomly remembered something, I would go back in and add it. By the time I was finished, I had created a 37 page single-spaced document. I was downright shocked at how much my brain was able to imagine, and how vibrant my daydreams had been. I spent time reading through what I had written, and tried to remember where I was in life during the time I was role-playing certain adventures and what I was feeling at the time. After, I took the time to say goodbye.

Saying goodbye to your favorite world and characters is a very emotional experience. Don’t let yourself feel embarrassed or ashamed to have big feelings. These aren’t just imaginary characters to us; when other people talk about saying goodbye to their MD world and characters, they often equate it to grieving a real person. Many of us have created best friends in our daydreams. We have created parental figures. We have created romantic partners that we have fallen deeply in love with. Saying goodbye to all of these characters is very hard. Take that time to process these emotions. Whenever you’re finished with creating your dream journal, store it somewhere and return to it if you need. Whenever you miss any of your characters, try to remember that even though you loved them, the characters you created are just that; your creation. There are REAL people in this world that love you unconditionally. You no longer have to spend hours imagining holding your characters hand, having a conversation or getting a hug from them; you can go and do those things with the REAL people in your life. I promise the real thing is so much better.

Step 8: Hold yourself accountable for slip-ups, but also give yourself lots of grace.

You will slip up. One day you’re going to be driving your car, taking a shower, cleaning your house, ect, and realize that you slipped back into your MD world. Do not beat yourself up. You did not become a maladaptive daydreamer overnight, so how can you expect yourself to be cured overnight? Many of us have spent a huge portion of our lives slipping into our daydreams without even thinking about it. If you accidentally slip up or have a bad day and feel like you need to MD for an hour or two, give yourself grace. You are not a failure, and you can still be successful in quitting. Whenever I had my own slip-ups, I had a little internal dialogue that I would always tell myself: “The people I am daydreaming about aren’t real. *I* am real. *I* am the one who gets to live a real life in this world. And isn’t that a beautiful thing!?” I found that repeating that mantra whenever I would slip up helped bring be back to reality, while also being gentle enough that I didn’t feel guilty or ashamed whenever it happened.

Also, it is important to remember that maladaptive daydreaming is completely different than regular daydreaming. The average person spends over 40% of their waking hours daydreaming.

https://time.com/6256541/why-daydreaming-is-good-for-you/

I found this article very helpful in determining what levels of daydreaming were normal and healthy, and what wasn’t. In general, whenever I mindlessly daydream, I make it a point to never bring any of my MD storylines and characters into it. I have spent years creating so much depth to these characters, that it is impossible to passively or healthily daydream about any of them anymore. I try to daydream about realistic goals for the future, and plan out tasks that I need to do. I let my mind wonder whenever I perform low effort tasks, such as chores, and I make that my daily escape.

Lastly, I do not let myself feel angry or guilty about how much time I wasted MD, nor do I think about how my life would’ve been different if I had never been a maladaptive daydreamer. Those thoughts are pointless and will get you no where. We cannot change the past, we must focus on the future. Yes, I spent a lot of time daydreaming, but I still have so much life to live where I can be present and in the moment. It is never too late to start fresh.



In conclusion:

It’s been about 6 months since I took the first step to stop maladaptive daydreaming. It was a long and sometimes hard process, and the road to recovery was not always linear. However, I thought I would share some of by biggest accomplishments:

-I have reconnected with old friends, and have realized that real, tangible relationships will always be more meaningful than the imaginary ones.

-I have continued to attend my weekly hobbies, as well as continuing to try new things.

-I go to random events in my area that sound intriguing to me, and I have the confidence to show up alone and meet people. Recently, I attended a grand opening night at an art gallery, where I met some really cool people who I have continued to chat with via text.

-I went from spending over 12 hours a day on my phone to 3-4 hours. I don’t spend hours mindlessly scrolling my social media apps every day while I wait for inspiration for MD.

-I have spent months studying for my graduate school entrance exam. I will finally take it in October, before applying to graduate programs this upcoming winter.

-I just returned from a 2 week vacation to Alaska with my family. Before, I would’ve chosen to spend much of my vacation in the room daydreaming by myself. However, this was the first vacation where I was completely present.

-I can once again listen to music with earbuds without slipping back into my maladaptive daydreams. Instead of all day every day, I still limit it to an hour or two a day, usually during the evenings, when I’m working out, or doing chores. Listening to music has finally become JUST listening to music, and that’s an incredible thing.

All in all, I am very proud of the progress I have made. I have found that it truly does get easier. The desire to return to maladaptive daydreaming becomes easier and easier to ignore until it becomes so small that you find yourself going an hour, and then multiple hours, and then a day, and then multiple days without even thinking about the worlds you spent years creating.

One of the biggest revelations I’ve had during this whole thing is that I really do like who I am as a person. No, I am not fabulously wealthy. Or supermodel-level gorgeous. Or a mega genius. However, I have great emotional intelligence. I have the ability to read a room. I am incredibly witty, and my dry humor makes people around my laugh. I am smart. I am fun to be around. There are beautiful & intelligent men in this world who also find me beautiful & intelligent. I am creative. I will never become the ultimate human whom I spent years daydreaming about. However, I add value to this world, and I am satisfied with that. Reality and the world around us can be a sad, dull, infuriating, frightening, happy, emotional place. But, it is always reality, and the fact that I get to experience being a human in this world is a beautiful thing.

If you have read it this far, thank you. If you are in the early stages of stopping your own maladaptive daydreams, I am here for you and I believe in you. If you have any questions for me or need advice or encouragement, don’t hesitate to leave me a comment. We are in this together. <3

1pyzms1,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pyzms1/hide_now/,HIDE NOW.,"If you’re reading this, HIDE NOW.

That was the first text message I got that morning.

It came from an unknown number. No name. No emoji. No follow-up. Just those five words, all caps, like the sender was afraid of being overheard even through a phone.

For a few seconds, I sat up in bed, staring at the screen while my alarm continued to chirp beside me. The early light filtering through my blinds gave my room its usual harmless look: laundry on the chair, posters peeling at the corners, my backpack slumped against the wall. Everything normal. Everything safe.

I checked the time. 6:14 a.m.

I laughed, one sharp breath through my nose.

A prank.

Spam.

It was just someone messing with me. My friends thought it was funny to send creepy stuff sometimes, especially before exams.

Still, my thumb hovered over the keyboard longer than it should have.

*Who the fuck is this?* I typed.

The message showed as delivered. No response.

I tossed the phone onto my bed and stood up, stretching. I had school. A math test. A bus to catch. The real world didn’t pause for anonymous texts.

As I brushed my teeth, I kept glancing at my reflection, half-expecting to see something different. Someone standing behind me. A shadow that didn’t belong to me.

Nothing.

By the time I was dressed, the message had faded into the background noise of my mind—unsettling, but distant. I grabbed my phone again as I headed downstairs.

Another message had come in.

**They know you saw the first one.**

My stomach dropped so suddenly it felt like I’d missed a step on the stairs.

“Mom?” I called, my voice cracking in a way I didn’t like.

“In the kitchen,” she answered, cheerful, unaware.

I stood frozen halfway down the stairs, staring at the screen. My phone buzzed again.

**You have three minutes.**

“Three minutes for what?” I whispered.

I typed again, hands shaking now. *Who are they?*

The response came instantly.

**Not who. What.**

A chill crept up my arms. I suddenly became aware of every sound in the house: the hum of the refrigerator, the tick of the clock, my mom humming softly to herself.

I went into the kitchen, trying to act normal. My mom slid a plate of toast toward me.

“You look pale,” she said. “Did you sleep?”

“Yeah,” I lied.

My phone buzzed on the counter.

**Two minutes.**

I swallowed hard. “Mom… did you get any weird messages this morning?”

She frowned. “No. Why?”

Another buzz.

**They’re closer than you think.**

My chest tightened. “I—I think someone’s messing with me.”

My mom sighed, already reaching for her coffee.

“Sweetheart, if it’s a prank, ignore it. You’ll miss your bus.”

The phone vibrated again.

**One minute.**

I felt lightheaded. “Mom, I think we should—”

The lights flickered.

Just once. Quick. Like a blink.

My mom looked up. “Probably the storm last night.”

The phone buzzed again.

**Thirty seconds. Closet. Bathroom. Anywhere without windows. Do NOT be seen.**

My heart slammed against my ribs. This was too specific. Too urgent.

I grabbed my phone and backed away from the counter.

“Mom, please, we need to go somewhere else in the house.”

She stared at me, confused now. “What’s going on?”

The lights flickered again—longer this time.

My phone buzzed.

**They’re here.**

A sound came from outside.

Not a knock.

Not footsteps.

A low, dragging scrape, like something heavy being pulled across concrete.

My mom turned toward the front door.

“Did someone—”

“Don’t open it,” I said, louder than I meant to.

She froze. “What?”

The scrape came again. Closer. Accompanied by something else now—a faint clicking, irregular, like nails tapping out of sync.

My phone buzzed nonstop, messages stacking faster than I could read.

**DO NOT LET THEM SEE YOU**

**THEY MIMIC**

Just picked up a used Philips Saeco Exprelia today. Did a full teardown for cleaning and inspection. Lubed up all o-rings and brew unit, seems to make some decent coffe as of now!

However, i feel like the inside driptray is collecting a rather big amount of waste water after only 3/4 cups of coffee being brewed. Cant see any clear leaks inside, but have ordered an o-ring kit for both the brew group and the water inlet.

Anything else i should check? After some googling, it seems like its maybe quite normal for the seaco brew units to discard alot of water while in use? My mom has a newer Philips 2200, and she has to empty the drip tray daily.

1pyzkpt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pyzkpt,Built a coffee table and centerpiece tray for my BIL,"The top is a reclaimed board, unclear what species but I think oak? Ran into a couple old nails, good to know my bandsaw can slice through them like butter during the resaw process. It did reveal old nail holes, stains etc but I just find that to be an interesting part of the story. 

The legs are cherry from a slab I got from a local woodworker who was shutting down his shop.  I added a slight taper on two sides for visual interest. The stretchers are ash from my local lumber yard. 

Base is joined with dominoes and glue, the top is fastened with bolts going into threaded inserts in the top. I also added c-channels to help with cupping (just in case that's a real thing). 

The dry fit felt spot-on but the glue and clamping process felt like a wrestling match. Luckily the process of flattening, pouring epoxy, etc for the top was all smooth sailing (thank you Blacktail Studio Epoxy course - highly recommend if you're trying to get into this stuff). 

I kept some edges sharp and others I hit with a small chamfer. I did two sizes on the top and bottom of the top. All sanded to 220 and finished with Osmo Polyx which I am really loving despite having tried Rubio Monocoat. 

Mistakes: Overall I was pretty pleased with how this project came out. I did have a little bit of splitting where the dominoes went in so I had to patch/glue/finesse those areas. The top was also thin enough that the recesses for my c-channels were visible through the epoxy so I had to put a coat of black paint underneath. This process also explained to me why most epoxy slab tables start over 2"" thick and end over 1"" thich. I think this finished thickness is just around 3/4"". I also cut my top down to size with my track saw so one end is 1/8"" wider than the other.

1pyzht2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pyzht2,Quest 3 interim solution,"Hello all, this post is mostly for fun and my own learnings on options.  I’ve had back problems for several years that have worsened progressively.  I won’t get into the clinicals other than to say its lower lumber area and the recommended course right now is to try to spend more time laying down.  My standing desk has been good, but even standing is a problem now.  Nerves are burning through every possible location in my lower abdomen and medical advice is to rest… how do you rest when you are a dad of young kids and full-time job?  My girls are still really little, and I want to be there for them, so I’m trying to find creative ways to get rest when I still have to work.

I asked ChatGPT all about VR options that would allow me to lay flat with lumbar support and it says that the Quest 3 may be the best option.  I was looking at maybe a Viture option as well.  I was thinking that maybe the Viture Beast could be an option if I want to go to the park or do my physical therapy while working.   I’m hopeful that one of these VR options could be the way to add more neutral spine positioning throughout my day. I do lots of boring businessy shit like powerpoints, analysis, and emails.  I’m also interested in using it to game but that isn’t the clear priority.

I asked chat GPT for some options to get me through until I save up for the best VR for the task, so I decided to literally do exactly what it suggested.

It said to put two chairs together and use yoga mat material to hold a monitor in place.  I cut pieces of the yoga mat and then put them on top of the chair back then set the monitor in place.  So far I have done 3 hours of work after my spine procedure and its been working fine.  The main downside is that this may fall on my face and really hurt.  LOL

Its ok though as there is 10% chance I can dodge according to best AI Models which will improve with two cups of coffee to 12%.  Here are the pictures of the current dope ass setup that was directed by ChatGPT. Also, here is a picture generated with Chat GPT on the request of the likely outcome of this setup. Happy holidays!

1pyzeyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pyzeyw/aitah_for_refusing_my_mother_in_laws_food_at_her/,AITAH for refusing my mother in laws food at her house,"Back story: Married to my husband for over a decade. We lived with my in laws for the first 2 years and moved out as soon as we could afford our own place. 
Mother in law (MIL) and I were never close. My husband and fam is a different nationality (but we’re all southeast Asian) so I always thought maybe the language barrier contributed to the lack of closeness. But while living with them, she would make comments like. “Oh look, even a toddler knows that should be put away. Smarter than some adults.” Mind you, I wasn’t messy at their place. I think it was her way of always making sure I felt below her. We were cordial to each other and never got into an argument or anything. I know she never really liked me but she’s never said anything to my face so whatever. My husband actually didn’t get along with his parents but always just did as he was told. 

3 years ago, father in law passed away unexpectedly and she moved into our place the next day. Cooking for her was a nuisance. She doesn’t eat beef (because it stinks). Doesn’t like pork. Doesn’t like too much chicken and can only have 1 egg every other day. Prawns are scary cuz they’re too big and, god forbid, if any of the food is product of china she won’t touch it. She would straight up tell my husband the house smells if I’m cooking beef (I always make an alternative dish for her). 
She refuses anything with sugar because it’s bad for her health. So when I offer her anything sweet she would say….”no I don’t like. It’s too sweet. It’s not good for me. You eat it.” 
She made a comment when I put sugar in my coffee. “You like sugar. Did you get it from your mom? She likes to eat sugary things too?” It rubbed me the wrong way. Like keep my mother out of your mouth.

She also would favour my two sons over my daughter, which pissed me the F off. 

Meanwhile, my husband is annoyed and pissed at her for other reasons. Her praising her now deceased husband who never worked after moving to our current living country 25 years ago and was abusive to MIL, my husband and SIL (he started mellowing out the last 15 years or so and never physically abused them anymore). MIL said he had apologized (but that never happened to my husband or his sister). Not sure what apology he gave to MIL. 

I was never mean to her, never talked back. I’m a SAHM and she doesn’t drive. So when my husband works during the day, I took her everywhere she needed to go while she lived with us. 
She was in the midst of selling the house FIL and her were living in, we drove and checked her house twice a week. Drove her to the bank to pay for utility bills for her house, to the lawyer, grocery store, anywhere she needed to go, I told her to just let me know. 

Anyway, a year ago my husband asked her to move out. There was a huge fight. Mind you, in our culture, it’s expected that parents live with their sons until they pass. But she eventually accepted it and got a house two blocks alway from us. She would msg my husband to bring her garbage bin in and out, mow her lawn, shovel her sidewalk, bring her grocery shopping/bank every weekend. She’s in her early 60s. Takes 3 walks a day when the weather is nice, but too fragile to do anything else. 

Anyway, about a month ago, he told me she msged him “be careful/smart, don’t need to tell your wife everything.” I’m like what the fuck. Why the fuck is she saying this. He didn’t reply to his msg. I also didn’t mind that he didn’t because I wanted to know what else she had to say. 
She then texted him:
“I’m worried that your wife is still young, if you pass, she will use your money on her new boyfriend and your kids will not get any.”
“Lots of men are broke.” 
“But don’t worry, leave it to God.”

Fucking crazy. Absolutely nth happened between us. I cut her hair the day before she sent all these msgs and we made small talk. I wasn’t rude. Idk wtf was brewing in her mind to want to send those msgs to my husband. Both him and I were pissed but at the end I told him to just reply “ok”. I wanted to see what else this bitch had to say. But she sent nth else like that after. 

Xmas comes. I buy presents for every single person except for MIL. And I didn’t want my kids to question it, so I ended up just getting a random sweater for her. Xmas day, we go over to her house around noon. I refused all the food she offered. She offered a slice of dessert her neighbour dropped off, I said “I’m cutting back on sweets.” She gave me dumplings, i told her “no, it’s okay. I’m good” (just like how she always refused my food) but she just left it next to me. So I walked over to my husband and gave it to my husband and said “I don’t need to eat so much. You eat it, you work so hard.” 
I know I pissed her off because I refused all her food. For some reason my son asked me at her house why Im always checking dad’s phone. And I said loudly “we’re married, it’s normal and ok that we see each other’s phones.” Idk if she understood I was trying to hint than I know what she texted my husband. She’s very tech illiterate. She may think my husband didn’t tell me and I won’t understand her msgs that was sent in their native language.
My parents, who has always been polite to my MIL, gave some food to my husband to pass on to my MIL on Xmas night. Husband didn’t see MIL again until the 27th. And she looked inside (which had dried mango and cashews) and said “it’s okay. Give it back. I don’t have money to return the gift unless I win the lottery. I don’t need it (the food).”

She has my parents number but never even texted a thank you. My mom texts/calls MIL from time to time. My mom asked her to join my husbands bday dinner that my parents hosted at their house, but she refused. My mom checked in on her in person, daily for 14 days straight when she was alone in her house while we went out of the country. Bringing her groceries a few times, despite MIL telling my mom that my husband already took her grocery shopping before we left. My MIL told me when we came back that my mom was an angel for doing that. But all of a sudden my parents don’t even deserve a thank you? 

She’s a bitch. Her disrespecting me, I felt angry and hurt. She disrespecting my parents, I feel rage.

* AP Spanish teacher - Also haven't read, but counselor raved about it, so I'd venture to say it's strong. Taught me in 9th and 11th grade and was one of my 11th-grade advisors, so bore witness to my StuCo leadership.

**Essays:** I like to think that I'm a strong writer, but I don't believe my essays were anything extraordinary.

Penn TY Note: Wrote to a regular at the coffee shop I worked at freshman year, and our genuine interactions that inspired (and continue to inspire) me to live authentically.

Penn Community: Connected the handwritten letters my grandma mails me every month in French, which taught me the importance of intention, to the mindset I intend to approach campus with.

Why CAS: Wrote about the many worlds I explore while preparing for debate topics, and how the grueling process of researching them has yet to deter me from the activity–demonstrating my passion for policy.

**Context:** My dad passed away at the end of my sophomore year, which I mentioned in my personal statement. Although my grades weren't affected, I absolutely was, so leaving it out of my essay seemed disingenuous.

I also participated in Penn's PEEP.

**Notes:** I was certain that being in PreCalc as a senior would get me rejected, but I'm happy to report that it didn't!

For those unaware Nick Shirley walks up to a “daycare” with a misspelled name and tries to look for children inside and nocks on the door. He
Implies that this place is committing fraud after showing they received 1.5 million subsides in 2025. 

Turns about the place has been closed by the city officials earlier this year, has 95 violations for child endangerment, had its license revoked, and won’t be able to re-new the license until the end of 2026.

https://www.newsweek.com/daycare-center-minnesota-fraud-video-violations-11280554

Is this place a scam? I have no idea maybe, they could also be a really shitty daycare too but finding no children there when it’s closed isn’t an indication of that. 

Shirley also filmed a Bakery called Albi Kitchen which opened in on July that is in the front of the building. They already seem to have good reviews. I feel bad for the owner of this place shes going to get so many bad actors showing up.

https://albikitchen.com

“14 health care companies in one building”

Shirley goes to a building in Minneapolis with a number of businesses and community centers inside and claims they are healthcare companies walks up to one and asks for healthcare. 

Many issues here one most of businesses were not for healthcare related purposes some were community centers, one was a dollar general, another was a coffee shop. About 5 or so were home care companies for elderly and disabled people. The fact that Nick Shirley a clearly young able bodied man I surprised that he gets the cops called him would be funny if it didn’t sound so moronic. 


I haven’t finished his whole video or seen other clips and after this I honestly don’t want to. This media spectacle is ridiculous.

Sometimes she helps. Not usually. And I'm so tired of it now. I ask for help, I ask her to dry while I wash up or start cooking for me or making a coffee or going to the shop to get something, and it's almost usually met with ""uuuurgh but whyyyy"" or some variation of that.

She says she has a lot of anxiety, but when I ask her to get help for it she refuses. She just smokes and does nothing all day. She drives and is a very good mechanic, which is great, but that doesn't outweigh how I do the daily life stuff and want her help for one or two things, and she just moans.

1pyze9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1pyze9w/having_a_parent_in_crisis/,Having a parent in crisis,"Hi all — sorry in advance if this is long. I’m starting to feel like a burden to my friends (they’ve been incredibly supportive and kind, but I hate constantly messaging them), so I’ve turned to Reddit for support. This whole situation feels like a complete mess, and any advice or words of encouragement would mean a lot.

For context: my dad is a recovered alcoholic with a long and complicated mental health history. He experienced a rough childhood from parents who likely struggled from mental illness. His brother has had multiple psychiatric crises over the years. I’m not entirely sure what my uncle’s formal diagnosis is, but another relative told me it was bipolar disorder. I’ve also always questioned my dad’s exact diagnosis — he’s been largely treatment-resistant for years and has struggled with his mental health for as long as I can remember. Several years ago, he had a full manic episode after being started on Abilify. It was truly the scariest thing I’ve ever dealt with. I believe alcohol masked or altered many of his symptoms for years, and now that he’s sober, we’re seeing his illness more clearly. His current diagnoses are GAD and MDD, although there are apparently notes in his chart saying BD. Nobody, not even his doctor, knows his true diagnosis. This makes treatment damn near impossible. 

My dad has always been anxious, depressed, and hyperactive, but things have escalated significantly recently. He’s been on Zoloft for years, but after a recent dose increase, he began experiencing constant burning and tingling in his tongue. His psychiatrist attributed this to the medication, stopped the Zoloft, and switched him to Lexapro. Since coming off Zoloft, my dad has completely unraveled. He’s been to the emergency department twice for suicidal ideation and severe anxiety, only to be discharged each time with hydroxyzine and a benzodiazepine. He’s now extremely hyperactive and impulsive, unable to relax, irritable and snappy, compulsively drinking water and coffee, speaking rapidly, and generally unable to settle. I’ve seen him like this before, but never to this extent — and I’ve never heard him make suicidal comments until now.

I immediately suspected hypomania, though my sister disagrees (we both work in healthcare and have experience with psychiatric patients). Regardless of the label, it was clear my dad was a danger to himself, so we had him voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When he was admitted this morning, he seemed relieved and hopeful about getting help. But when we spoke to him later this afternoon, he sounded panicked, out of breath, and abruptly hung up on us.

I am completely exhausted. I’ve been dealing with my dad’s mental health struggles my entire life. I don’t want to sound selfish, but I truly feel like I don’t have the emotional capacity for this right now. I just graduated with my master’s degree and am studying for a board exam to become licensed. I’m preparing to move and start a new job in psych nursing (ironic, I know). I’m already beyond stressed, and this situation has sent me on an emotional roller coaster I don’t know how to manage. I want to be there for my mom, dad, and sister—but I have been the family caretaker my entire life. What do I do? How do I mentally deal with this? I would love to know others have dealt with this & it gets better. 

(I do go to therapy and am medicated for anxiety/mild depression, so I have that! My therapist is out of town for the next few weeks.)",1,1767045225.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

They say your life flashes before your eyes when you die.

Turns out, that’s not quite true.

It’s not just flashes—it’s a flood. A slow, deliberate wave. Every joy, every wound, every choice, laid bare—not just for someone else to judge, but for *you* to see clearly, maybe for the first time.

As Matt passed through the shimmering light, memories wrapped around him like a film reel spinning just behind his eyes.

He saw himself being born—tiny, fragile, too early. Snow fell hard that night, blanketing the world in white while a young couple sat praying in a hospital room. Machines beeped. Nurses rushed. And yet, the tiny life pulled through.

Then five years old. Dehydrated. His lips cracked, his arms wrapped in tubes and tape. He remembered that hospital smell—clean but sharp. His body was small, but he was already learning what it meant to fight.

Years passed, and hospitals became a second home. Illnesses. Infections. Tests. Sometimes he asked if he was just… broken.

At nine, his parents signed him up for martial arts. He’d watched too many Bruce Lee movies and tried his new “skills” on his little sister. His parents weren’t amused. But instead of punishing him, they gave him something else—discipline, purpose, a space to grow.

Then ten. A fundraising carwash at the dojo. He’d been running, laughing—and a car came around the corner too fast. The world flipped. Pain exploded. He remembered the look on his instructor’s face, like it was *his* heart that had been hit.

But none of those moments compared to what came next.

The memory slowed.

\*\*\*

He was sixteen, standing in the living room, palms sweaty, heart hammering in his chest. “I’m bisexual,” he’d said. “It’s not a phase. It’s who I am.”

The words hung there like shattered glass.

His father’s face twisted in rage. His mother’s voice rose in pitch and fury, calling him sick. Saying he was cursed. That the devil lived inside him.

Then came the worst part: “Get out. Don’t come back.”

He remembered the way his sister, Abby, had curled up on his bed, sobbing, as he packed a small bag. He’d hugged her tight, whispering that it wasn’t her fault. That he’d always love her.

That was the day Matt learned what it meant to lose your whole world—and still keep moving.

More memories came—this time faster, brighter. Not all of them were painful.

Matt was eighteen, sitting cross-legged on the floor of a cramped studio apartment in Carson City, Nevada. The walls were bare, the furniture minimal, but the light from the small window fell just right on the newspaper spread out in front of him. An ad caught his eye.

**“Become a CNA—We’ll Pay for Your Training if You Work for a Year!”**

He stared at it for a long time. Something in him stirred.

The next moments came in flashes—his first day of training, fumbling through blood pressure cuffs and gait belts. The written exam. The clinicals. The sweaty nerves of the skills test. And then, the moment he held that little plastic card in his hand:

**Certified Nursing Assistant – Matthew Stone**

It wasn’t just a license—it was a door.

Then the day he stepped into the ICU for the first time. The beeping monitors. The hiss of oxygen. The barely whispered conversations between nurses and families. It was chaos, beauty, and purpose all wrapped into one.

And for the first time in his life, Matt knew.

*This is what I’m meant to do.*

From there, the memories soared.

College classes. Study groups. Endless nights spent memorizing pharmacology and anatomy. Coffee and cold pizza. And finally—walking across the stage, cap and gown swaying, as he was handed a crisp envelope.

**Registered Nurse – Matthew Stone, RN.**

He held it with both hands. Like it was something sacred.

\*\*\*

The memories began to slow now—not because they were less important, but because they meant the most.

Matt saw himself in the thick of the ER. Gown on, gloves snapped tight, moving from trauma to trauma. The rhythm of the place was chaos to some—but to Matt, it was music. He wasn’t just part of the team—he was the calm in the storm. He held hands. He wiped tears. He stayed late. He made people feel human in their final moments.

There were so many faces.

The young man he comforted as a code was called. The elderly woman who gripped his hand and whispered “thank you” with her last breath. The teenager who made it, and wrote him a thank-you letter two months later. The patient who relapsed. The one who didn’t wake up. The baby who did.

He remembered every one.

They flowed past him now like stars, each one a heartbeat in the constellation of his life.

And then—he saw *her*.

The little girl.

Big brown eyes. Blood on her shirt. Crying for her mother in the middle of that street. He’d scooped her into his arms without a second thought, shielding her from the gunfire, dragging her to cover. His body moved before his brain could.

That was the last thing he ever did.

The memory paused. The girl looked up at him, tears streaking down her cheeks, and whispered:

**“You’re my hero.”**

And then… the light came.

Soft, steady, warm.

A presence filled the space around him—not a voice, not a face, but something *knowing*. It didn’t speak. It didn’t need to. The weight of judgment lifted, replaced with quiet certainty.

I was able to do everything asked of me but I still feel lost and unsure as to be expected. 

Anyway, as soon as my shift finished and I got into my car, I started crying and just couldn't stop. It's been 3 hours and I haven't stopped crying.

Just had to vent. I can't stop crying and I'm overwhelmed and don't know what to do. I feel so lost.

*“Remember this day,” Donald Trump said after the storming of the Capitol in 2021. Almost five years later, former correspondent Michael Persson sees that the memories of that January 6 have been erased.*  
  
The noose dangled from a gallows on the lawn in front of the Capitol when suddenly a man ran towards it, climbed the scaffold, and cut the rope with a knife. He ran away and when he passed me, he threw the noose at my feet like a wad of spit. I picked it up and put it in my backpack. That's how the noose came into my possession.  
  
It was late afternoon on January 6, 2021. The pale green heart of the American capital was already largely deserted. The tens of thousands of protesters who had been shouting here just a few hours earlier had stormed the Capitol or gone to eat at a nearby restaurant.  
  
Chaos still reigned in and around the building. On the steps, police officers were slowly regaining ground. Inside, they had shot and killed one of the hundreds of intruders. Of the more than 100 injured officers, one would die the next day and four others would later commit suicide.  
  
**Hang Mike Pence**  
Donald Trump, the president who couldn't accept his loss, had told his supporters earlier that afternoon that they had to “fight hard” because otherwise they would “no longer have a country.” He had directed them to the Capitol, where well-prepared extremists such as the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers launched the attack, and where he responded sympathetically to calls to hang his vice president, Mike Pence. Now Trump sent a kind of farewell message to the stormers via Twitter.  
  
“These things happen when a sacred, obvious election victory is so ruthlessly taken away from the great patriots who have been treated so badly and unfairly for so long. Go home in love and peace. Remember this day forever!”  
  
Remembering that is what this story is about. And about the forgetting that has taken its place.  
  
**Two faces**  
The person who had thrown the noose at my feet was a black man in his twenties. That took courage; the lawn in front of the Capitol was no place for black men that day. Unfortunately, he had disappeared before I knew it; I would have liked to talk to him. Because there was an American who had set up a gallows that day, but here was an American who had disabled it. The uprising and the resistance to it: the two faces of America came together in the noose. That was the story I wanted to tell.  
  
The Americans also saw more than just a piece of rope. After leaving the noose in the backseat of my car for a few days, I heard that the National Museum of American History was looking for “artifacts” from January 6. That's America: lacking a long history, always ready to see the historical significance of a new day and immediately collect the items that go with it, from the hat President Abraham Lincoln wore when he was shot to the very first 3M Post-it notes. The museum is also known as America's attic. I let them know what I had, and the curator of political history called me. She was eager to acquire the noose.  
  
I consulted with my daughter, who is always good at ethical issues. Give it away? Keep it? Or maybe sell it? In a country where collectors pay 3 or 4 million for a historic baseball, I thought there must also be fanatics who would be willing to pay a pretty penny for a souvenir of a nearly successful coup. But I couldn't think of a single potential buyer I wouldn't regret selling it to.  
  
Besides, I thought, I've received many stories from this country, now I can give one back. My daughter could already picture the honorary nameplate next to the display case. That sealed the deal.  
  
**Possible evidence**  
I described the item in a Zoom meeting to the curator and the *registrar*, who is responsible for acquiring objects. Orange rope, plastic, about half a meter long, with a loop that would have fit Pence's head perfectly. But the knot was not a usable hangman's knot. A kind of washcloth had been tucked between the coils and the rope to make it thicker. The knot did not slip—this could only have been used to hang someone symbolically.  
  
Still, a symbolic scaffold can be threatening enough. The museum staff felt that the FBI should be notified.  
  
Journalists do not cooperate with investigative services. You never reveal your sources. This, on the other hand, was possible evidence, and of an attack on democracy at that. So I sent an email on Monday, January 18. “I think the FBI has more important things to worry about,” I wrote. “But if you need this, let me know.”  
  
I immediately received a response from Samantha Shero, press officer at the FBI's Washington Field Office. “Thank you, the FBI is very interested in this,” she wrote. “Someone will contact you.”  
  
The next day, I received a message from Garrett Churchill, special agent with the CR-10 division of the Washington Field Office. “Please don't throw the noose away,” he emailed. He called me and said that the gallows could still be interpreted as a threat or even a hate crime. Gallows and nooses have a racist and extremist past, and still suggest lynching or the execution of traitors. “This is an important matter,” Churchill said. “I would like to find out who hung it up.” There are my daughter's fingerprints on it, I added.  
  
A few days later, I drove back to Washington. I parked on a corner and a man wearing sunglasses approached me, Chris Keefe, another special agent. I took the noose from the back seat and he took it, wearing gloves, to put it in a plastic bag with a label on it. When will I get it back, I asked, it still has to go to the museum. “When we're done with it,” Keefe said.  
  
Churchill sent a confirmation. “We understand that you want the object to go to the Smithsonian Museum of American History if the FBI decides in the future that it is no longer necessary to keep it,” he wrote. “I can't say for sure when that will be. Thanks again for your help.”  
  
That's how I lost posession of the noose. It's for a good cause, I thought.  
  
**Back in Washington**  
Almost five years later, no longer a correspondent, I arrive back in Washington. Trump's influence is noticeable. In the neighbourhood around the White House, the thuds of the piles being driven to support Trump's gigantic ballroom can be heard. At the side entrance, a line of clean-shaven men in long coats and women in dresses are waiting to be let in—Christian leaders making their appearance.  
  
A little further on, it is quiet at Harry's Bar, which five years ago was the base of operations for the Proud Boys, who drank themselves into a frenzy there before their fights and stabbings after the elections (I got to know them when I helped one of them who had been stabbed in the neck on election night), and who launched the attack on the Capitol on January 6. The burger joint is closed, the Proud Boys have disappeared.  
  
Today's Trump supporters can now be found, much more chic, at Butterworth's, where evenings begin with expensive meat and end with the noisy drunkenness of a student fraternity, where they believe that January 6 was no big deal. “Democracy has always been a bit messy.”  
  
Downplaying is happening at the highest level. This month, three judges nominated by Trump appeared before the Senate, which must approve them. When asked whether the Capitol was attacked on January 6, 2021, the most daring answer was: “A few individuals went inside.”  
  
**A troubling mystery**  
I am here to see what has happened to my noose in this new America.  
  
Since I handed it over to Keefe, I have heard nothing from the FBI. The last time I contacted Churchill was in early January, a few weeks before Trump's inauguration. Everything could change, I told him. But there was no response.  
  
Has any investigation been conducted into the maker(s) of the noose in all these years? According to Scott MacFarlane, a journalist with the American television network CBS who has reported extensively on January 6, the noose remains a “worrying mystery” of the Capitol riot. He has found that 1,500 suspects have been convicted for their actions on that day, but no one seems to have anything to do with the gallows.  
  
Even though there are indeed clues.  
  
Security camera footage shows five men arriving early in the morning on January 6 with a hand truck loaded with wood, which they drive onto the lawn near the Capitol. The leader is wearing a long trench coat, a white scarf that reaches the ground, and a large hat. He walks with a cane. They grab some coffee, build the scaffold in 45 minutes, and then disappear from view. In the afternoon, they return to attach the crossbar and hang the noose. Nevertheless, a report by a House of Representatives committee last year concluded that “the individuals who built the gallows have never been identified.”  
  
**The Turner Diaries**  
The New York Times discovered that this did not come out of the blue. “We are going to build a gallows right in front of the Capitol so that the traitors know what is at stake,” wrote an anonymous user in an online chat channel a few days after Trump said in a tweet that there would be a big protest on January 6. “Be there, it's going to be wild!”  
  
Another user wrote that such a gallows “could be built very quickly with the right plan and the right people bringing pre-cut materials.” And: “Does anyone have a blueprint for a standing gallows? Who's in?” A few days later, someone posted a diagram with the necessary parts. Someone else posted instructions for the hangman's knot.  
  
The enthusiasm seems to be partly inspired by The Turner Diaries, a 1978 novel popular with right-wing extremists and neo-Nazis. It depicts an assault on the Capitol, and on “Rope Day,” traitors are hanged en masse. After January 6, extremists themselves made the comparison and the book was purchased in large numbers until Amazon stopped selling it.  
  
So that's where the noose came from.  
  
**FBI office**  
The Washington Field Office is where Shero, Churchill, and Keefe worked. None of the three ever responded to my questions. I only received a “no comment” from the general FBI media service, where Shero now works, in response to the question of whether, after someone was arrested in December for planting pipe bombs on January 6, there was anything to say about the status of the noose.  
  
It's one of those white Washington offices, with an American flag and a Department of Justice flag flying along the wall. Two police cars with lots of antennas on the roof are parked in front of the entrance. When I ring the bell, FBI agent Nelson Everett comes out and asks what I'm doing there. “I'm here to pick up my property,” I say, and explain the situation. “Do you still need that thing?”  
  
“I'm pretty sure all the investigations into January 6 have been halted,” he says. “We're no longer interested in them since the pardons.”  
  
No surprise, of course. The first thing Trump did on the day of his inauguration was to grant a broad pardon to all those convicted that day, including the Proud Boys, who had been sentenced to up to 22 years in prison. So it makes sense that the investigation would also be halted. “It has frustrated some agents,” he says. “I was here on January 6, guarding the buildings. It was a crazy day. And now it's as if nothing happened.”  
  
“But then I can get the noose back?” I say.  
  
“To be honest, I really don't know where that thing could be,” he says, which is quite a disappointment for an organization known for its bureaucracy. “Then you'll have to contact the officers you've been in touch with.”  
  
They're not responding, I say. That's the only way, he says.  
  
**Dismissed agents**  
So the next day, I make sure I'm there at 8 a.m., when the workday starts, and I talk to everyone who goes inside—Special Agent Churchill? Special Agent Keefe? They give me a wide berth. After fifteen minutes, another agent comes out, and I tell him who I'm looking for.  
  
He can't say anything about specific names—he doesn't give his own name either. But in general, he can say something. “I don't want to sound too political, but since Trump became president, many of the agents involved in the investigation into January 6 and Trump's attempts to rig the election have left. Not even transferred: fired. And a quarter of all the people who still work here have to help ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ed.) search for illegal immigrants.”  
  
Since Trump appointed Kash Patel as head of the FBI in February, a major purge has been underway. Patel, a conspiracy theorist, wrote in his 2023 book Government Gangsters that the FBI is part of the “tyranny” of the deep state. In his podcast three years ago, he claimed that the FBI investigations into the January 6 insurrectionists were “political prosecutions.”  
  
One of the departments that has been shut down is CR-15, the team that was at the heart of Operation Arctic Frost, which investigated Trump's role on January 6. Lead investigator Jack Smith, who resigned ten days before Trump's inauguration, reiterated his conclusion to Congress this month that Trump was criminally liable.  
  
And the noose? “It could be anywhere. It's also quite possible that we'll keep it forever. You never know if the investigation will be reopened.”  
  
**Concrete moat**  
Only Samantha Shero can tell what happened to the noose and whether Churchill and Keefe were really sent away. She is the only one of my contacts who is definitely still working for the FBI. As a spokesperson, she has even been promoted from the Washington Field Office to headquarters a few blocks away, an impenetrable brutalist bunker surrounded by a kind of concrete moat. Agents let their dogs sniff parked trucks for explosives.  
  
After that first email in which she eagerly accepted the noose, Shero never responded again. Knocking on the door doesn't help: a guard comes out, suspiciously keeping three meters away, and fishes a business card out of her breast pocket with a contact address that no one ever answers.  
  
I drive to the address Churchill gave me, just outside Washington. It turns out he has moved. He is not answering his phone. The noose is gone, and so is everyone who had anything to do with it.  
  
**Spiritual leader**  
If you go to the Capitol now, there is nothing to remind you of January 6. Tourists take pictures of the immaculate building as if nothing had happened, as if tens of thousands of people, incited by the president himself, had not attempted a kind of coup d'état here.  
  
Aren't you missing something here, I ask Josh McPherson, who is posing with his wife in front of the Christmas tree, in the spot where the mob attacked five years ago. A memorial, a reminder?  
  
“Absolutely not! The idea that there was an insurrection is completely out of proportion,” he says. “There is nothing that needs to be remembered.” What about the dead and wounded? The gallows? “Whatever Trump said, that day was peaceful,” says McPherson, a pastor from Washington state, now in the capital because he is one of the “faith leaders” Trump likes to surround himself with. “What is really under attack is our faith. That's what we have to defend!”  
  
I ask Officer Morey of the Capitol Police, who is guarding the Christmas tree. Isn't there a commemorative plaque for him and his colleagues? “Yes and no,” says Morey. “Yes, there is a plaque, but no, it's not up yet. Trump and the Republicans are blocking it.”  
  
In 2022, Congress passed a special law to create a bronze plaque to honor the defenders of the Capitol. It was made and was supposed to be hung within a year, but it has been sitting in the basement of the building for three years now because the political winds quickly changed. The Republicans regained the majority and blocked its hanging, even though they too had been rescued by the police. Two officers filed a lawsuit this summer to get the plaque hung.  
  
“They're trying to forget what happened,” says police officer Daniel Hodges, who was seriously injured in 2021 while defending the Capitol—his head was caught in the doors. He still works for the Washington police department, has just finished his night shift, but is speaking on his own behalf. “Look, in the beginning, this plaque was simply meant to honor my colleagues who fought, bled, and died to defend the Capitol and everyone inside. Now it's about more than that. This is about the truth. It's about what happened that day.”  
  
A lonely battle  
The whitewashing and reversal of history did not surprise him—it was at the heart of the Trump campaign. Guilt became innocence, with the pardon of the men who had attacked Hodges and received seven years in prison. “Thanks America,” Hodges tweeted on the day that happened. “That was terrible, but not surprising,” he says. “I don't take it personally. It's politics.”  
  
Hodges is fighting the legal battle over the plaque alongside Harry Dunn of the Capitol Police, but it is a lonely fight. “Not many colleagues talk about it. For most of them, it was just their job; they don't want to dwell on the political implications. And I don't want to be the person who talks about it all the time.”  
  
“The truth matters,” Charles Lavine (78), a Democratic representative for the state of New York, told me a few days earlier in the town of Glen Cove on Long Island. “Rewriting history always hurts people.”  
  
He has introduced a bill that requires January 6 to be included in history lessons in schools in his state. “It was initially intended to be symbolic,” he says. “To stimulate thinking that history should be protected and appreciated. But Trump and his henchmen are now so serious that this law has become necessary.”  
  
He cites as an example the photo of the scarred back of a black man who escaped slavery, which has been removed from some national parks. “That is frightening and disgusting. This erasure of history comes straight out of the handbook for tyrants.”  
  
**Political history**  
Like the other Smithsonian museums, the National Museum of American History is located on the Mall, the large lawn in Washington where the rebels gathered, not far from the Capitol, not far from the FBI headquarters. A concrete warehouse filled with the belief in progress from the past. Outside, the yellow buses empty, and the square fills with the exuberant excitement of a school trip. All American children should know this.  
  
It is a wonderful museum, in all its disorienting multitude. Thirty thousand objects are on display, and there are another two million or so in storage. From the star-spangled banner from 1812, an enormous flag that survived a war and inspired the national anthem (a tad racist, says the guide), to Indiana Jones' whip – here lies everything that Americans have made America over the past 250 years.  
  
With political history at its core.  
  
This is where the buttons, caps, and flags that employees collect every four years at national party conventions end up. This is where the protest signs from demonstrations, eternally demanding justice, end up. On January 7, 2021, an employee walked for hours in the early morning across the battlefield in front of the Capitol to pick up hundreds of remnants of the uprising, from Bible flags to a Kevlar vest.  
  
Only, they are nowhere to be seen. If the noose has arrived here, it has not yet been hung.  
  
**'Wrong' interpretation**  
Even the paperwork needed to record ownership – so that no one can claim ‘their’ rubbish afterwards – has never been started, says a former employee. According to him, the intention was to quickly include a few dozen of the found objects in the permanent exhibition, but fears of a ‘wrong’ interpretation quickly took hold. Even online, the rebellion paraphernalia cannot be found.  
  
“American Democracy: A Great Leap of Faith” is written with appropriate pride at the entrance to this section of the museum, which explores topics such as “citizen participation and debate, from the formation of the nation to the present day.” But there is nothing to see from the present day. The leap on January 6 was a little too deep.  
  
The display case with campaign goodies still contains a classic MAGA cap and a ‘Joe’ button from the 2020 elections, but that's where political history ends. Among the protest signs from across the decades, there is no ‘Stop the Steal’ or ‘Hang Mike Pence’ to be seen – in that display case, time ends with Black Lives Matter. The past ends in the fall of 2020.  
  
**Semantic executioner**  
There is still debate about that history, they say at the museum (both the curator and the registrar to whom I promised the noose no longer want to speak on the record). What language should we use to describe what happened? How should January 6 be referred to, for starters? A demonstration? Riots? An uprising? An attack? But they don't want to make that choice. We don't want to tell people what to think about history, I am told by staff members. “As soon as we say what it is, it becomes a fact. And we don't want to tell people what to think about history.”  
  
In a way, it's a compliment. Americans expect their national museum to give meaning to events—to act as a semantic judge. But the museum shies away from that role. It's not up to us to write the story, says an anonymous employee. And certainly not if it means the museum itself becomes part of the story.  
  
That's exactly what happened.  
  
In March, Trump declared in his presidential decree ‘Restoring Value and Common Sense to American History’ that ‘we will restore the Smithsonian to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness (...) to bring pride to the hearts of all Americans’. “Ideological indoctrination or polarizing narratives” were also to be banned.  
  
The White House is threatening that funding will only be available “for use in a manner consistent” with the executive order.  
  
**No more talking about it**  
That has an effect, and it immediately affects January 6. Because the only thing to be found in the museum about that day is under the heading “impeachment” in the presidential gallery. That is where the two impeachment proceedings against Trump are listed. The second impeachment was because of his frantic attempts to remain president illegally.  
  
And that is precisely where the words have changed. In July, the sign was removed, and a month later, a new sign was put up.  
  
It no longer stated that Trump had made “repeated false statements” about the election results. It also omitted that on January 6, he had given a speech, a few hundred meters from here, that “encouraged—and very predictably resulted in—the immediate lawless action at the Capitol.”  
  
Trump, who five years ago called on his supporters to fight and said we should remember that day forever, now wants us to forget it.  
  
The people I promised the noose to don't dare talk about it. The museum's official response is that it is “committed to the accurate, factual presentation of history.” In its capacity as the ‘museum of the nation’, it wants to take great care to ‘ensure that what we present reflects both intellectual integrity and thoughtful design’.  
  
And so there is nothing to see. There is an open space where the noose would fit perfectly. Someday, the vacuum may be filled.",1,1767044860.0,AmericanPolitics,0,1.0,False

I had been married for almost 15 years and was in my mid 40s, so I hadn’t been on the dating scene in a while. I joined four or five different apps,  jumping into the brave new world of cyber dating. During Covid to boot.

It was as bad as everybody says it is. I wasn’t ready. 

One of my rules was, I wouldn’t date any women who didn’t have kids of their own.  Mainly because I wanted to date someone who knew what it meant to be a parent and understood the world through that lense.*

So, I matched with this one woman, and she seemed really nice. We chatted for a few days and decided that we were going to have the obligatory coffee date. I told her that having kids, my schedule could change at the last minute and that they were my priority.  She said she understood completely, and having a kid herself, she felt the same way. 

Awesome, right? This was exactly why I chose to date only women with kids. Because they understand. Supposedly. 

So the morning of our coffee date, one of my kids gets very very sick and l have to take them to the doctor. I contact this woman and explain the situation. I tell her that I’m sorry we’re going to have to reschedule, and I even offer three or four alternative days and times for our date. I didn’t leave it open. Ended like I was just trying to brush her off. I generally wanted to reschedule.

Well, this woman goes off on me. Asks how are we supposed to get to know each other when I can’t even make time for a simple coffee date. Says I’m flaky and a couple more not so flattering things. 

Needless to say, we did not reschedule. 

*I’m not ragging on women who have chosen not to have kids or that never had the opportunity to have them. It was all about just finding that common ground right away in regards to having families. I found the majority (there were exceptions of course) of the women on the sites who didn’t have kids were either looking to have kids of their own sooner rather than later (I wasn’t interested in having anymore), or they wanted to be prioritized over my kids, which was not going to happen. It’s not a commentary on their life choices, just that where I was in my life, I knew what I wanted. ",0,1767044503.0,DatingHell,1,0.5,False

1pyz12x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1pyz12x/how_to_navigate_friendship_with_a_friend_who_is/,How to navigate friendship with a friend who is super frugal?,"Hello everyone! I wonder if you have any suggestions on how to maintain a friendship with someone who is super frugal. I really like this friend because we usually have great conversations, but it is a bit hard to feel very close because of her views on reciprocity between friends. We are both 34. 

I have known this friend, let’s call her Lydia, since university. At that time, we were both students, so I did not really notice this aspect of her personality. We mostly studied together back then. I reconnected with her about three years ago, and I really enjoy her company, mainly because our conversations are always interesting. However, over time, I gradually realized that she is very frugal.

For example, I have invited Lydia to my place for dessert and tea or coffee at least a dozen times. I often buy good cookies or pastries from my favorite local bakery and prepare nice tea and coffee, or I spend time making desserts for both of us. I have also invited her over for dinner a couple of times. On the other hand, Lydia sometimes invites me to her place for tea, but she never prepares anything other than very basic tea. She knows I love black tea with milk, yet her house often has no milk when I visit. One time there was milk, but it had been in the fridge for so long that it tasted strange.

Another example is that we both joined a local paddling group in the summer and a skiing group in the winter. Since Lydia does not have a car, I am usually the one driving. We live about an eight minute drive from each other. While I appreciate that she contributes gas money, I am the driver most of the time. On two occasions, when my husband needed the car, Lydia suggested renting a car and driving us to the activity. However, we usually split the rental cost equally. For example, if the rental is sixty dollars plus thirty dollars for gas, we split everything fifty fifty. There were also a few times when I told her she did not need to give me gas money because the drive was very short, only about thirty minutes to a nearby paddling or skiing spot. She would then say, “Oh, I will buy you a coffee next time,” but that never actually happened.

I also noticed that although Lydia likes going to restaurants and sometimes asks me to go with her, we always split the bill. She usually orders only a cheap main dish and nothing else. I have started feeling a bit uneasy going to restaurants with her because I usually order one or two drinks, an appetizer, a main dish, and dessert. I have a much bigger appetite than most people, so I often need to order more food. I always share my food with her, but since she only orders a main dish, I do not feel comfortable asking her to share.

Lydia feels very different from my other friends. For example, when I drive my other friends, they not only split the gas but often buy me a coffee as well, not every time, but usually. My other friends who paddle or ski also have cars, so they sometimes offer to drive me. They invite me to their homes for meals, and the food is always nicely prepared. I also have close friends who occasionally treat me to meals at restaurants, for example after I helped them assemble furniture or move. Overall, my relationships with others feel more balanced.

While I understand that Lydia has no obligation to offer rides or prepare nice food when she invites me over, I still feel a bit disappointed. I wonder if I am expecting too much.

I do believe she wants to be friends with me because she regularly messages me to see how I am doing and suggests meeting for a drink or coffee about once or twice a month.

From what I understand, she does not have debt. She is saving for a down payment, comes from a middle class family with both parents working in government jobs, and has a pretty decent income as a software engineer. This makes me a bit confused about her level of frugality, and I am wondering how to find a better balance in this friendship.",0,1767044367.0,AskWomenOver30,23,0.22,False

I feel it deeply, and yet I am surrounded by “friends”, “family”, and a social media community. So why is it that I still so often feel alone, with a lingering sense of melancholy?

I had to ask myself this question today as I sat in my house, having not spoken to anyone in person, only replying to messages from friends asking how I was feeling. Why do so many of us feel this way, despite having thousands of followers and friendship groups that are meant to represent our closest people? I think part of the answer is that for many of us, 80 or even 90 percent of these friendships are made up of people we see rarely, perhaps once every few months if we are lucky. The “catch-up friend” has become the norm. These relationships still matter, but they cannot carry the full weight of human connection on their own.

We are slowly creating a society where relationships no longer require the low-level but deeply important effort they once did. We underestimate the value of low-stakes connection: going to the gym with the same friend every week, having a regular coffee, a biweekly phone call, attending classes where you see familiar faces, or simply existing in spaces where your life is quietly witnessed.

Today, so much of our lives are witnessed only through social media. Even that is complicated. Many of us try to live unseen lives online, where posting feels awkward, performative, or even embarrassing. Yet we still struggle to understand why we feel so lonely.

During one of my familiar spirals of loneliness today, I realised something important. Although I have lost significant relationships this year, I do not think their absence alone is what is causing this feeling. What I think I am missing is continuity. The experience of living life alongside others on a regular basis. Something as simple as belonging to a shared space, where you recognise faces and are recognised in return, can make a profound difference. Being seen, not in a dramatic or intense way, but quietly and consistently.

As the new year approaches, I have started thinking seriously about how I want to create this kind of continuity for myself. Not more people, not more intensity, but more presence. More moments where my life, in its ordinary form, is gently witnessed.

My mum is a raging narcissist.

She will belittle anyone for her own superiority.

When I was growing up, she would call me names, she could switch to screaming very quickly, she would follow me when I tried to escape to my room, which ended in my self harming due to extreme overwhelm. She never believed in me, would frequently tell me how shit I was, embarrassed me in front of others for laughs. It was horrible.

This carried on throughout adulthood too.

Shed take me to the shops and I would refuse her to buy me anything, she would beg I get something. Just to get to the counter and say ‘mum buying her stuff again when shes an adult’ just to embarrass me

Id call her to catch up, and share something really important and she pauses and says she brought a new outfit.

Id tell her i feel down, she would say you feel down alot get a grip

Im 30, I have a home and work full time, I have 2 children with additional needs & after a mental breakdown I asked if I could stay with her for the night, she said firstly ‘no your kids need you’ and ‘there is no space’ she has a 5 bed house btw that she lives in alone, but I needed space.

I came, in the morning its ‘dont forget to brush your teeth’ after dinner its ‘are you going to wash up probably not’ i asked if she wanted a coffee its ‘you would never do that’ its ‘your house is disgusting with kids stuff everywhere’ we had small talk i shared my friends were saving for houses by living with their parents she said ‘they are obviously moron, pathetic freaks why would anyone want to do that’

Its just constant, once I called her as I was struggling with my disabled child and I cried she said ‘get a grip or put him in care if you cant be a parent’

When she dies, I almost cant wait and count down the days, ive always had constant self doubt, I have diagnosed ADHD and hyper vigilance, unexplained constant palpitations since I was a child.

My partner is completely emotionally unavailable.

What did i do wrong to have those closest to me be so incredibly unsupportive and horrible, the worst bit is im trapped as I cannot cope with my kids needs alone and I have nobody else.

The handle on the filter basket broke, and was like $30+ shipping to replace.

Since then, I’ve religiously used their recommended descaler, flushed it after that feature was added, etc. On Christmas morning this year I woke up to ‘add water’ again, and flushing moves 0.0ml of water.

A Date to Remember: Elly’s Delightful Charm Shines!
===================================================

**Unlocking the Essence of Joy**

As we embark on the journey of life, we often find ourselves caught up in the hustle and bustle, overlooking the simple beauties that surround us. In this delightful video, “A Date to Remember: Elly’s Delightful Charm Shines,” we are invited to pause and cherish those precious moments that fill our hearts with joy and gratitude. Elly’s infectious spirit and undeniable charm serve as a beacon of light, reminding us of the importance of savoring each day with a positive attitude.

**Delight in the Little Things**

The story of Elly is a gentle yet powerful reminder that joy can be found in the tiniest details. Just as Proverbs 17:22 states, “A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones,” we learn that our outlook can significantly influence our experiences.

Consider the following:

- **Daily Joys**: Each morning presents opportunities—whether it’s a warm cup of coffee, the laughter of friends, or the beauty of nature. Finding delight in these small moments can transform our attitude for the rest of the day.
- **Kindness Matters**: Elly exemplifies how a small act of kindness can lead to joy not only for ourselves but also for those around us. Simple gestures, like offering a compliment or lending a helping hand, can create a ripple effect of positivity.
- **Gratitude Practice**: Elly’s charm shines even brighter when she practices gratitude. Writing down three things we are thankful for each day can shift our focus from what we lack to what we possess. This shift in perspective can lead us to experience joy in every moment.

**Embracing Authenticity**

Elly doesn’t just spread joy; she encapsulates what it means to be authentic. In a world that often emphasizes perfection, her enchanting character serves as a reminder that it’s our unique quirks and imperfections that make us who we are.

Just as Psalm 139:14 tells us, “I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made,” we realize that embracing our true selves allows us to shine brighter.

Connecting with Elly’s charming authenticity can inspire us to:

1. **Be Yourself**: Embrace who you are without hesitation. The world craves authenticity, and by being true to ourselves, we can connect deeper with others.
2. **Celebrate Uniqueness**: Recognize that it’s the differences in each of us that enrich our communities. Let us celebrate what makes us unique rather than conforming to societal molds.
3. **Create Meaningful Connections**: When we are authentic, we allow others to see our true selves. This honesty fosters trust, which strengthens relationships and invites joy into our interactions.

**In the Spirit of Fun and Fellowship**

One of the most delightful aspects of the video is the vibrant connections Elly makes with others. As believers, we are called to cultivate relationships, just as Jesus modeled during His time on earth. Elly reminds us of the power of fellowship and community.

In the same spirit:

- **Engage With Others**: Just as Elly shines in her connections, we, too, can reach out to friends and family, encouraging them through laughter and love.
- **Participate in Community Events**: Join local gatherings or church activities. Fun events are not only enjoyable but also create lasting bonds that enhance our spiritual journeys.
- **Share the Joy**: Lastly, let us remember that the joy we possess is meant to be shared. By extending kindness and charm like Elly, we can brighten the lives of those around us.

**Closing Thoughts**

“A Date to Remember: Elly’s Delightful Charm Shines!” encourages us to embrace joy, authenticity, and fellowship. Let Elly’s delightful spirit inspire our daily lives, urging us to reflect on the beauty surrounding us and the blessings we possess.

As we move forward, let’s challenge ourselves to embody the positive, charming energy that Elly radiates. With every smile, heartfelt gesture, and authentic moment, we can create a life filled with joy—a life worthy of remembrance!

Join us in this beautiful journey, and don’t forget to spread the delight wherever you go! ⚡✨

Im a 28 yo male, 150 lbs and 6 foot. Ive always been skinny with a crazy metabolism, though admittedly I probably dont eat enough due to anxiety. I quit smoking marijuana concentrates 5 days ago, after 10 years of daily use. I also vaped nicotine daily..... well until today. I was a sports guy in high school and was always fit, but havent really worked out in about 10 years (ironically since i started heavy marijuana use). I try to eat nutritious home cooked meals and dont eat out at all, if anything i dont eat enough. I am always walking at work. 

Anyways, I decided I want to have a healthier lifestyle. I started with quitting marijuana, though its not even been a week. I also have been lifting for at least 20 mins daily, but i do sets so im never super out of breath. Yesterday I decided to run. I ran a mile in about 12 mins (pitiful compared to my high school days!) It was 32 degrees F out. I drank 16 oz of water during/after. When i was done, it felt like I was DYING. I mean I never remember being that exhausted. My vision was a little spotty, legs shaky, hard to balance, it felt like needles in my chest when I inhaled, and I kept tasting blood when there wasn't any. I also kept feeling like I was gonna cough something up but didnt.  I got home and laid down, practiced breathing techniques and felt fine after 20 mins or so. I immediately came to the conclusion that vaping/smoking is terrible for your body, and had no desire to touch my vape at all. Its been 24 hours and honestly i dont see a reason to pick it back up. So thats a plus, because before that i had tried quitting 3 times this week to no avail.... keep in mind i am quitting cold turkey from both. Im not using any substance to substitute, so im sure its hitting me hard. Ive never really been a drinker or used any other substances. I also dont use pre workout. (Should I?)  

I guess I am just wondering, how normal are these symptoms for someone that hasn't worked out in a decade? On top of smoking/vaping? Am i just out of shape or is there something more serious? What else would you guys recommend for a healthier lifestyle, besides the above?


(I also just wanted to say, anyone out there struggling to kick a weed or nicotine addiction, START WORKING OUT. Or hike, bike, skate, hell anything to keep your mind occupied with a healthy habit. Im not even that type of guy but it works. Plus the head high and clarity you get after a work out or run is amazing, even if i  thought i was dying, i was content lol. Im telling you, after that run, I actually was ashamed that I had neglected my health for so long. I came home and looked at my vape in pure disgust, and I NEVER thought id be able to kick it. My desire to want to be healthy far outweighs my desire to smoke or vape now. Literally the only ""drug"" in my system is the one cup of coffee I drink per day now. I cant imagine after a couple weeks what I will feel like. 
Dont get me wrong, my anxiety is still out of wack, my endorphins are non existent,, and the insomnia/ lack of appetite is real after quitting weed. But i know it'll get better with time. )

1pyysdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimNikah/comments/1pyysdo/intentional_dating_clear_boundaries_still_ending/,"Intentional dating, clear boundaries… still ending up in uncomfortable situations. Burnt out and confused — advice welcome.","I’m a 28F Muslim woman (turning 29 soon), living in the UK, working full-time in a demanding corporate role. I live independently, earn well, support my family, and I’m dating with genuine intention for marriage — not casual dating.

I’ve struggled with dating apps on and off because I have ADHD and tendencies toward limerence, meaning I can get emotionally overstimulated or attached quickly if I’m not careful. Because of that, I deactivated apps for about four months to protect my peace. Over Christmas holidays, when I finally had mental space, I reactivated one intentionally — with clear boundaries, clear non-negotiables, and upfront conversations about marriage.

Despite that, I still ended up in two situations over the past few days that left me feeling uncomfortable, used, and emotionally drained.

Context / my approach:

	•	I’m very upfront from the beginning about intentions (marriage-focused).

	•	I ask the “serious” questions early (faith, prayer, finances, readiness).

	•	I’m not on apps for validation — male attention isn’t the issue.

	•	I don’t have family/friends matchmaking for me, no community WhatsApp CV groups, and I’m not South Asian — so apps feel like my only option right now.

	•	I have tawakkul, but I also believe in tying your camel.

What happened:

Date 1:

Text conversations beforehand were serious and aligned. In person, the date was late at night, casual (coffee), and quickly became physically intense despite me being clear about boundaries. There were inconsistencies between what he said and how he behaved (including poor communication afterward). I left feeling like the date didn’t match the intentional tone that had been set.

Date 2:

Initially respectful, polite, calm. However, once he was in my home (after asking to use the bathroom), the situation escalated physically very quickly and crossed boundaries I hadn’t consented to. I had to explicitly end the interaction. This left me feeling unsafe, disappointed, and honestly violated in retrospect.

Neither situation aligns with what I want or what I clearly communicated.

The bigger issue:

I’m exhausted because I feel like I’m doing everything right:

	•	clear intentions,

	•	early vetting,

	•	boundaries,

	•	pacing myself,

yet once I meet men in person, the same nonsense still happens.

I’ve also noticed a recurring pattern over time:

	•	Men who are religious and respectful often feel emotionally flat or incompatible personality-wise.

	•	Men with strong chemistry, warmth, and connection often lack religiosity or discipline (which are non-negotiable for me).

	•	Past experiences include engagements and near-marriage situations falling apart due to parental influence or sudden changes in criteria — which feels like a lack of backbone to me.

I don’t believe I’m being vain when I say I know what I bring to the table — stability, values, kindness, effort, independence — and I’m not looking to lower my standards just to be married. I’m also not interested in continuing hyper-independence forever; I genuinely want companionship and a family.

My questions:

	•	How do you date intentionally on apps without ending up in these situations?

	•	Is this just the reality of apps, regardless of how clear your boundaries are?

	•	Am I being too picky — or just tired?

	•	If apps aren’t it, what realistic alternatives exist for someone like me (full-time job, limited community matchmaking, no family searching)?

	•	How do you protect yourself emotionally and physically without shutting down completely?

I still have faith in Allah’s plan, but I’m human — and right now I’m burnt out and discouraged. I’d really appreciate grounded advice, especially from people who’ve navigated this successfully or stepped away from apps without giving up entirely.",1,1767043803.0,MuslimNikah,12,0.6,False

I’m 31F in South Burnaby looking to meet like-minded girlfriends for genuine friendships (age 28–35 ideally).I prefer local just so it's simpler, but I’m open to a bit further if we really click. I’m in a long-term committed relationship and only looking for female friends.

I’d describe myself as somewhere between extroverted and introverted. I can be outgoing and adventurous with the right people, but I also enjoy quiet, slow days at home. I’m looking for friendships that are not super high-maintenance but full of warmth, laughter, meaningful conversation, and fun activities together when we do hang out. Being in my 30s, it would be great to connect with women at a similar stage of life and priorities, where we can click and relate on a lot of things :) 

A bit about me: I enjoy cooking (and am a bit of a foodie), I’m a huge coffee fan, like discovering new music on Spotify, watching indie or A24 films, and exploring new activities or places that catch my eye. I’m open to trying classes or even a new sport if it sounds like fun for both of us. I’m not a huge partier or drinker, but I still enjoy going out ie. visiting cool restaurants, concerts or shows, casual shopping, or a quick coffee date or errand hangout.

I am a bit of a homebody in the winter, but during the summer I actually prefer being outdoors. I'm into beach days, parks, lakes, picnics, a farmer's market, or even a hike. It’s less about the specific activity and more about enjoying good company wherever we go. 

I’m hoping for once or twice a month hangout (maybe more in summer) and longer-term friendships that feel real, fun, and compatible even if we're not always hanging out due to being busy with life.

1pyyoga,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pyyoga/the_calls_that_werent_there/,The Calls That Weren't There,"I've been on the console for eleven years. That puts me on the graveyard shift more times than I can count — the hours when the city forgets it has faces. You learn to read silence as well as you read shouting: the way a caller breathes, the way a radio squawks, the small stutter before a person decides a truth is worth telling.


Two nights into a slow spring, the CAD lit up for a welfare check. Elderly neighbor heard muffled crying through a wall. Address checked out: a duplex on Lanier and Third. Officer rolled, I patched the caller's details through, filed the notes. The officer called 23 minutes later: empty apartment, no signs of forced entry, no sound, no one inside.


Family reported her missing two days later. Name, DOB, social, a lifetime of utility bills and a photo. We ran plates, canvassed, pinged the number on file. Phone dead. No CCTV caught anyone leaving. It smelled, in the dispatch center way, like parking a piece of a puzzle on the wrong table.


Another case — hours later, a jogger on the river trail called to say another runner had vanished mid-stride. The caller was breathless and calm, like someone who'd rehearsed for this before dialing. “He was right here,” she said. “I looked away for a second and he was gone.” GPS on her phone put her at a bend ringed with willow roots. Units found footprints that stopped at the water's edge. No body, no blood, nothing to show that anybody had been there. We marked it as missing, open.


Calls started to stack like that — small impossible things. A teenager who texted his mother an image of his empty bedroom and then called 911 to say he couldn't see his reflection anymore. A bus passenger who watched a woman standing in the aisle turn into a corridor of empty seats. A mother who woke to find her son's bedroom door closed and the bed made, though she was sure he'd fallen asleep on top of the covers. Each report precise, never hysterical, always the same flat certainty: someone was gone.


We checked names against DMV, schools, health records. For some, there were basic traces — old addresses, a driver's license photograph — but when investigators pulled deeper, records thinned. The DMV returned a file that looked half-erased. School transcripts with attendance gaps that predated kindergarten. Calls to past addresses met with neighbors who insisted they'd never seen the person. It was like trying to confirm a rumor about a ghost by using a ledger written with invisible ink.


I started to notice something in my own logs: timestamps where callers referenced each other. “I saw her at Lanier,” one would say, or “He was on the trail too.” Names and descriptions overlapped so often that you could map a subway of sightings. But when CAD teams cross-checked different entries for the same name, there were blank lines where witness accounts should have been. A child's drawing claimed as evidence in one report had no originating file in the school's records. A social media screenshot referenced in another call showed an account that had been created and deleted in the same hour.


We got a call that should have been ordinary: a man reporting a missing hitchhiker he'd given a ride to on the interstate. He sounded distraught. “She asked to be let out at the rest stop and then there was just a patch of empty grass,” he said. “Like she'd never been sitting there.” Our units went to that rest stop; cameras showed a car pulling in, a door opening, no one stepping out. The hitchhiker's backpack was on the back seat, zipped shut, no sign of struggle. Nobody on site had seen a person leave.


When the department's tech pulled the surveillance feeds, something small and wrong flickered in the frames: a pixel of static that moved against the grain of the image, like a moth skittering off-screen. We thought it was equipment. We replaced cameras, checked power supplies, and ran timestamps. The static tracked across multiple feeds and cameras that weren't networked together. When we enhanced the footage, the static bent, then thinned, leaving a clear snapshot where none had been the second before — a snapshot with an empty seat and a backpack.


The press started calling names to fill the quiet. We briefed a single reporter and asked for patience. He wrote a piece that suggested a pattern: people vanishing and leaving no trace. The article used the word ""erasure"" and the phone in my office blinked red with calls from relatives who wanted confirmation. We fed what we could, the cold facts: times, last-known locations, officers assigned. But the more we published, the more precise the blankness became. Some disappeared from public records entirely. Birthdays would no longer exist in calendar databases. Photographs of them in family albums, when scanned and enhanced, showed a faint paleness where the face should have been, like the emulsion had refused the impression.


One evening, a high-priority call came in from a woman in labor. Her phone call patched in over a shaky VoIP link. Between contractions she told us, “It's not my husband. He—he's not there. He's been gone for weeks.” She named him by the government name we'd been using for the missing on Lanier. She insisted he'd been home to help pack hospital bags. She cried and said she was alone. She insisted he existed for her, sounded like she had a photo pressed to her heart. We dispatched patrol with medics. The house was occupied. He had an old toolbox and fresh coffee. His bed was slept in. The officer's voice on the radio cut like knife steel: property records there, neighbors corroborated. But when records were pulled by investigators later, some services listed his name as an alias. His marriage certificate had a blank spot where his name should be, then a small clerk's note: ""No verifiable records.""


The more we tried to prove their existence, the more their proof slipped through our fingers like wet paper. Old coworkers of missing people would call, and we would listen to names tumble out of mouths — a softball team, a first job by the river, a prom date — and then check our servers and find nothing. The people who remembered could not, it seemed, be cross-verified. Their memories formed a dense tangle that made sense when told aloud, but disintegrated when digitalized.


One night, at 3:17 a.m., my headset lit for a 911 line. The caller was silent, just breathing in short, shallow gasps. On the recording, you could hear a background like a distant ceiling fan and the rustle of something like fabric. No one spoke for thirty-eight seconds. Then a voice, small and almost intimate, whispered, ""Do you remember me?"" I asked the standard questions — location, emergency — and the voice answered with coordinates. The lat/long pointed to a block that our units swore they'd patrolled a hundred times. When officers went to the coordinates, there was a vacant lot with a plaque commemorating a war memorial. People sat on the steps of nearby apartments. The lot had always existed. No fresh footprints. No depressions in the grass.


Later, we traced the call's routing. It had passed through networks in three different countries, then into a GSM exchange that, by all measures, didn't service any of them. The telco engineers sent back a terse message: ""No record of call origination found beyond this point."" I archived the waveform and, on a whim, ran it through an audio spectrum analyzer. A thin notch appeared at seven kilohertz, an almost silent ring that cut through the noise floor. When I looped the file at low volume, the notch hummed like a name.


Patterns gathered like lint on a coat. Each missing person had a thread: a time, a place, a small digital artifact — a half-deleted post, a blurred surveillance still, a phone ping that stopped in an empty field. Those artifacts would dissolve when we tried to subpoena details. Court clerks reported files with redacted lines and signatures that matched no known employee. When detectives tried to serve a subpoena to the ISP holding certain logs, the company replied with an invoice and then closed the account. Billing addresses returned to post office boxes that never had tenants.


We brought in the cold cases unit, and they treated it like a puzzle worth obsession. They mapped the vanishings on a GIS, overlaying everything from soil surveys to utility cut maps. There were corridors of absence — swaths of town where missing reports concentrated like storm cells. But when we tried to pin the pattern onto physical reality, we found our lines fell through like grain on a sieve. Subcontractor maps showed conduits that ended in gray shadings. Geotech surveys had areas labeled ""anomalous"" with cursory notes: ""low density; no significant strata."" The more we looked, the more our city became an atlas of empty margins.


I began dreaming of a room with blank walls and white chairs. When I woke, my hands were cramped from holding a pen as if to write names down. There were names I couldn't shake. They came as phrases whispering inside my head, like someone trying to recall a forgotten route. I'd open a binder and find the name not there, or worse, found a phantom entry with a different occupation and a different social security that led to a dead-end.


One detective, Reyes, began keeping a private notebook. He wrote names in the margins, circled them, drew lines between them like constellations. He kept little things: a torn ticket stub, a receipt from a diner, a pressed leaf. He swore the items were real because he could hold them. But friends who'd known the missing swore those things belonged to memories that had never been spoken aloud. Reyes started to talk about the way time shivered, how some memories felt ""unfurnished."" He'd come into the bullpen and say, with a laugh that didn't meet his eyes, ""Sometimes I can't tell if I'm looking for people or for permissions to remember them.""


Then came the mother whose son had been gone for nine months. She brought in a shoebox of his things: drawings, a keychain, a crumpled receipt for video games. She sat across from me in the quiet interview room and told me about the boy's favorite line from a movie. She spoke in present tense, and the words made a nest in the air. We ran numbers, tax records; we found a toddler's birth certificate but nothing in school records beyond kindergarten. The mother cried and held the paper close. I reached to take the receipt and felt its edges dissolve under my fingers, like dried petals.


We started getting calls from other cities, then from neighboring counties. The pattern wasn't local. A park in another state reported a cluster of disappearances over a span of ten years that matched our shape: small, precise, and never ending in bodies. I spoke with a dispatcher in that town. He sounded older, worn thin by the logic of absence. He'd kept a corkboard like a shrine of names. He told me he had found photographs in family albums with faces sunfaded away, and he asked me if I had ever tried to remember a face so hard it blurred out of existence. I told him yes. He told me that at night, he sometimes hears callers ask, “Do you remember me?” and he never knows whether to say yes.


The city appointed an interagency task force. We pulled in external forensic labs, academic consultants, archivists, and a psychologist who specialized in memory disorders. She ran cognitive tests on relatives who insisted their missing were real. Most scored normal, but their memories of the missing were surrounded by what she termed ""episodic erosion"" — rich, sensory recollections that lacked corroborating metadata. She asked if we had checked the city's cadastral records for anomalies. We had, and they came back clean, but a junior analyst found a set of parcel records that referenced parcels that never mapped to any coordinate system. They were labeled with names that matched people we were investigating. The analyst put them in a folder on his desk and, the next morning, swore they were gone.


At some point, a pattern in the calls turned less like a map and more like a rhythm. Callers began reporting the same odd preface: a metallic tang in the air, a low pressure like a glass tumbler filled halfway, a sense of being observed through thin fabric. I started logging that sensory phrase with the incident reports. Crews reported the sensation too. EMTs described the air as if it had been chewed down by something that wasn't meant to be inhaled.


An evidence tech recorded one of these scenes. She filmed a residential kitchen where a missing man had last been seen. The camera panned the room: plates stacked, a dog asleep, a calendar turned to May. Then the film showed a corner where the wallpaper had a faint square scar — a place that looked like an old photograph once lived there. When they enhanced the footage, the square glowed slightly and, for a single frame, an outline of a person's face appeared as if someone had pressed a palm to glass. The tech printed the frame and placed it in an evidence envelope. That envelope subsequently failed to show up during a court subpoena.


The families began to fracture in different ways. Some withdrew and kept the missing alive in private rituals — candles on porches at dusk, birthday cakes with one empty seat. Others tried to reclaim their lives, even as the unspooling ledger of absences threaded through their days. One woman painted over all of her son's murals in soft gray and then, a week later, woke to find one tiny corner of sky unpainted, blue as forgiveness. She told me she didn't do it. She'd been sleeping.


We brought in a specialist in data integrity to audit our servers. He sat in our server room and looked exhausted after two days. He said things like, ""You can't erase whole people from distributed ledgers without leaving hash residue,"" and then, after a long silence, ""But there are ways to make a thing ephemeral that don't behave like deletion."" He showed us traces — bits of corrupted UDP packets that resembled signatures but pointed nowhere. He drew a diagram with arrows that looped into themselves. He called the pattern ""an entropy seam."" He said the only way he'd ever seen anything like it was in archival systems damaged by cosmic rays — random, high-energy events that flip bits and make reality jitter.


We questioned cosmic rays for days, because the alternative — some human agency engineering selective absence — was a kind of government-freezer nightmare. Engineers came from the university and they measured radiation and electromagnetic fields. Everything read normal. We tested for chemical agents. Negative. We inventoried the power grid. Nothing. Still, the seam knotted the city.


The morning the mayor called, the newsroom and the station turned into a kind of animal panic. He wanted answers. He wanted a narrative. We had none we trusted. I consolidated reports and handed them up the chain. He looked at me and said, quietly, ""Find them."" I looked back and felt my voice thin. ""We are,"" I said. It felt like a promise I could not keep.


The strange calls continued. Once, a little girl called 911 to report her imaginary friend had been taken by a ""paper wind."" She sounded certain. Officers found crumpled paper at the edge of a playground — nothing else. Another caller insisted his neighbor had shrunk like a photograph. He described opening a closet and finding a coat hanging with its hanger empty, the outline of a man pressed into the fabric. The officer who checked the closet later refused to talk about what he saw. He took time off and moved to another county.


And then, in the middle of a Monday, we received a call that made every hair on my arms stand up. It was a recording from a call we had logged months earlier. The voice was my own — not the dispatcher who had answered then, but me. The time stamp matched our server time, and yet I knew I had not made the call. On the recording, I asked a woman who had reported a missing child, ""Do you remember me?"" and the woman answered me in a voice I had never heard before. She said, ""We asked you once. You said no."" The line ended with a click. We played it for a lab technician and he said, ""That's not possible. You weren't on duty."" But I was. I listened to myself ask a question I didn't remember asking.


We started to ask callers that question, quietly, in the gaps when background noise allowed: ""Do you remember me?"" It felt obscene, like leaning over a fresh grave. Some laughed, thinking we were playing a joke. Others answered with confusion. A few, hushed, said yes. One man whispered, ""Yes, I've always remembered you."" Then he asked why he couldn't find his wife's graduation photo in the album anymore. He asked why his son's preschool name tag had a smear where the name once had been stitched. He told us his daughter had been missing for three years and yet he could still taste the peppermint from her Halloween candy on his tongue like a small, private compass.


We tried, for a time, to be clinical. We logged everything. We cross-referenced. We wrote memos and sent them up the ladder and then watched them evaporate from shared drives. Memoranda became footnotes. A lieutenant told me in a hallway that his own sister had been the first to disappear when he was a child. He told me his memories of her were like vellum you could fold and crease: they retained shape, but they could not be scanned. ""We guard the not-having,"" he said. ""Maybe that's what it is. We guard the not-having.""


Months passed and the cases cooled into a new normal where a missing person case meant a different kind of work. We became archivists of doubt. Officers reassigned to these files learned to listen for the seam. We set up a special number for family meetings, a line where people could tell us about the folks they missed and where we would collect sensory details that never fit in formal reports: a laugh that liked the low notes, a preference for mint toothpaste, a limp from a soccer injury at eleven. Detectives cataloged those details like traits of endangered species, small things to look for if the world ever allowed them to be seen again.


Then a cluster of calls came in over a single weekend like a chorus. People reported seeing the same man in disparate places: on a freeway overpass, in a laundromat, in the back row of a church. He never stayed long. Witnesses who swore they had seen him gave the same description: a gray coat, a small scar by the eyebrow, hands that smelled faintly of metal. We circulated an APB and put his face on a missing poster. Families called, asking if this could be their missing. No one came forward. The man began to appear in urban legends on message boards — “the gray man” — and the sightings proliferated with the exact sameness you see in memes. There were so many reports that for a week our center was full of calls asking if we had found him.


On a Tuesday, a patrol found him crouched under an awning in a side street. He was older than any description suggested and wore a coat that looked moth-eaten. When officers called his name, he looked up like someone who had been interrupted reading. He had no ID, no memory of a hometown, no matching records. He spoke once, in a voice like a wind through keyholes: ""They forget because they have to."" He said it like a fact, like weather. When detectives tried to run him through the system, his prints returned noise. The fingerprint database returned a checksum error. We put him into protective custody and called the hospital. After four hours, a nurse called to tell us his wristband label had been smudged away. The intake sheet later read ""Unknown — patient refused ID."" We left him in a room with a single window. The next morning, the bed was made as if by careful hands. The man was gone.

1pyyo1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pyyo1f/the_calls_that_werent_there/,The Calls That Weren't There,"I've been on the console for eleven years. That puts me on the graveyard shift more times than I can count — the hours when the city forgets it has faces. You learn to read silence as well as you read shouting: the way a caller breathes, the way a radio squawks, the small stutter before a person decides a truth is worth telling.


Two nights into a slow spring, the CAD lit up for a welfare check. Elderly neighbor heard muffled crying through a wall. Address checked out: a duplex on Lanier and Third. Officer rolled, I patched the caller's details through, filed the notes. The officer called 23 minutes later: empty apartment, no signs of forced entry, no sound, no one inside.


Family reported her missing two days later. Name, DOB, social, a lifetime of utility bills and a photo. We ran plates, canvassed, pinged the number on file. Phone dead. No CCTV caught anyone leaving. It smelled, in the dispatch center way, like parking a piece of a puzzle on the wrong table.


Another case — hours later, a jogger on the river trail called to say another runner had vanished mid-stride. The caller was breathless and calm, like someone who'd rehearsed for this before dialing. “He was right here,” she said. “I looked away for a second and he was gone.” GPS on her phone put her at a bend ringed with willow roots. Units found footprints that stopped at the water's edge. No body, no blood, nothing to show that anybody had been there. We marked it as missing, open.


Calls started to stack like that — small impossible things. A teenager who texted his mother an image of his empty bedroom and then called 911 to say he couldn't see his reflection anymore. A bus passenger who watched a woman standing in the aisle turn into a corridor of empty seats. A mother who woke to find her son's bedroom door closed and the bed made, though she was sure he'd fallen asleep on top of the covers. Each report precise, never hysterical, always the same flat certainty: someone was gone.


We checked names against DMV, schools, health records. For some, there were basic traces — old addresses, a driver's license photograph — but when investigators pulled deeper, records thinned. The DMV returned a file that looked half-erased. School transcripts with attendance gaps that predated kindergarten. Calls to past addresses met with neighbors who insisted they'd never seen the person. It was like trying to confirm a rumor about a ghost by using a ledger written with invisible ink.


I started to notice something in my own logs: timestamps where callers referenced each other. “I saw her at Lanier,” one would say, or “He was on the trail too.” Names and descriptions overlapped so often that you could map a subway of sightings. But when CAD teams cross-checked different entries for the same name, there were blank lines where witness accounts should have been. A child's drawing claimed as evidence in one report had no originating file in the school's records. A social media screenshot referenced in another call showed an account that had been created and deleted in the same hour.


We got a call that should have been ordinary: a man reporting a missing hitchhiker he'd given a ride to on the interstate. He sounded distraught. “She asked to be let out at the rest stop and then there was just a patch of empty grass,” he said. “Like she'd never been sitting there.” Our units went to that rest stop; cameras showed a car pulling in, a door opening, no one stepping out. The hitchhiker's backpack was on the back seat, zipped shut, no sign of struggle. Nobody on site had seen a person leave.


When the department's tech pulled the surveillance feeds, something small and wrong flickered in the frames: a pixel of static that moved against the grain of the image, like a moth skittering off-screen. We thought it was equipment. We replaced cameras, checked power supplies, and ran timestamps. The static tracked across multiple feeds and cameras that weren't networked together. When we enhanced the footage, the static bent, then thinned, leaving a clear snapshot where none had been the second before — a snapshot with an empty seat and a backpack.


The press started calling names to fill the quiet. We briefed a single reporter and asked for patience. He wrote a piece that suggested a pattern: people vanishing and leaving no trace. The article used the word ""erasure"" and the phone in my office blinked red with calls from relatives who wanted confirmation. We fed what we could, the cold facts: times, last-known locations, officers assigned. But the more we published, the more precise the blankness became. Some disappeared from public records entirely. Birthdays would no longer exist in calendar databases. Photographs of them in family albums, when scanned and enhanced, showed a faint paleness where the face should have been, like the emulsion had refused the impression.


One evening, a high-priority call came in from a woman in labor. Her phone call patched in over a shaky VoIP link. Between contractions she told us, “It's not my husband. He—he's not there. He's been gone for weeks.” She named him by the government name we'd been using for the missing on Lanier. She insisted he'd been home to help pack hospital bags. She cried and said she was alone. She insisted he existed for her, sounded like she had a photo pressed to her heart. We dispatched patrol with medics. The house was occupied. He had an old toolbox and fresh coffee. His bed was slept in. The officer's voice on the radio cut like knife steel: property records there, neighbors corroborated. But when records were pulled by investigators later, some services listed his name as an alias. His marriage certificate had a blank spot where his name should be, then a small clerk's note: ""No verifiable records.""


The more we tried to prove their existence, the more their proof slipped through our fingers like wet paper.

Family reported her missing two days later. Name, DOB, social, a lifetime of utility bills and a photo. We ran plates, canvassed, pinged the number on file. Phone dead. No CCTV caught anyone leaving. It smelled, in the dispatch center way, like parking a piece of a puzzle on the wrong table.


Another case — hours later, a jogger on the river trail called to say another runner had vanished mid-stride. The caller was breathless and calm, like someone who'd rehearsed for this before dialing. “He was right here,” she said. “I looked away for a second and he was gone.” GPS on her phone put her at a bend ringed with willow roots. Units found footprints that stopped at the water's edge. No body, no blood, nothing to show that anybody had been there. We marked it as missing, open.


Calls started to stack like that — small impossible things. A teenager who texted his mother an image of his empty bedroom and then called 911 to say he couldn't see his reflection anymore. A bus passenger who watched a woman standing in the aisle turn into a corridor of empty seats. A mother who woke to find her son's bedroom door closed and the bed made, though she was sure he'd fallen asleep on top of the covers. Each report precise, never hysterical, always the same flat certainty: someone was gone.


We checked names against DMV, schools, health records. For some, there were basic traces — old addresses, a driver's license photograph — but when investigators pulled deeper, records thinned. The DMV returned a file that looked half-erased. School transcripts with attendance gaps that predated kindergarten. Calls to past addresses met with neighbors who insisted they'd never seen the person. It was like trying to confirm a rumor about a ghost by using a ledger written with invisible ink.


I started to notice something in my own logs: timestamps where callers referenced each other. “I saw her at Lanier,” one would say, or “He was on the trail too.” Names and descriptions overlapped so often that you could map a subway of sightings. But when CAD teams cross-checked different entries for the same name, there were blank lines where witness accounts should have been. A child's drawing claimed as evidence in one report had no originating file in the school's records. A social media screenshot referenced in another call showed an account that had been created and deleted in the same hour.


We got a call that should have been ordinary: a man reporting a missing hitchhiker he'd given a ride to on the interstate. He sounded distraught. “She asked to be let out at the rest stop and then there was just a patch of empty grass,” he said. “Like she'd never been sitting there.” Our units went to that rest stop; cameras showed a car pulling in, a door opening, no one stepping out. The hitchhiker's backpack was on the back seat, zipped shut, no sign of struggle. Nobody on site had seen a person leave.


When the department's tech pulled the surveillance feeds, something small and wrong flickered in the frames: a pixel of static that moved against the grain of the image, like a moth skittering off-screen. We thought it was equipment. We replaced cameras, checked power supplies, and ran timestamps. The static tracked across multiple feeds and cameras that weren't networked together. When we enhanced the footage, the static bent, then thinned, leaving a clear snapshot where none had been the second before — a snapshot with an empty seat and a backpack.


The press started calling names to fill the quiet. We briefed a single reporter and asked for patience. He wrote a piece that suggested a pattern: people vanishing and leaving no trace. The article used the word ""erasure"" and the phone in my office blinked red with calls from relatives who wanted confirmation. We fed what we could, the cold facts: times, last-known locations, officers assigned. But the more we published, the more precise the blankness became. Some disappeared from public records entirely. Birthdays would no longer exist in calendar databases. Photographs of them in family albums, when scanned and enhanced, showed a faint paleness where the face should have been, like the emulsion had refused the impression.


One evening, a high-priority call came in from a woman in labor. Her phone call patched in over a shaky VoIP link. Between contractions she told us, “It's not my husband. He—he's not there. He's been gone for weeks.” She named him by the government name we'd been using for the missing on Lanier. She insisted he'd been home to help pack hospital bags. She cried and said she was alone. She insisted he existed for her, sounded like she had a photo pressed to her heart. We dispatched patrol with medics. The house was occupied. He had an old toolbox and fresh coffee. His bed was slept in. The officer's voice on the radio cut like knife steel: property records there, neighbors corroborated. But when records were pulled by investigators later, some services listed his name as an alias. His marriage certificate had a blank spot where his name should be, then a small clerk's note: ""No verifiable records.""


The more we tried to prove their existence, the more their proof slipped through our fingers like wet paper. Old coworkers of missing people would call, and we would listen to names tumble out of mouths — a softball team, a first job by the river, a prom date — and then check our servers and find nothing. The people who remembered could not, it seemed, be cross-verified. Their memories formed a dense tangle that made sense when told aloud, but disintegrated when digitalized.


One night, at 3:17 a.m., my headset lit for a 911 line. The caller was silent, just breathing in short, shallow gasps. On the recording, you could hear a background like a distant ceiling fan and the rustle of something like fabric. No one spoke for thirty-eight seconds. Then a voice, small and almost intimate, whispered, ""Do you remember me?"" I asked the standard questions — location, emergency — and the voice answered with coordinates. The lat/long pointed to a block that our units swore they'd patrolled a hundred times. When officers went to the coordinates, there was a vacant lot with a plaque commemorating a war memorial. People sat on the steps of nearby apartments. The lot had always existed. No fresh footprints. No depressions in the grass.


Later, we traced the call's routing. It had passed through networks in three different countries, then into a GSM exchange that, by all measures, didn't service any of them. The telco engineers sent back a terse message: ""No record of call origination found beyond this point."" I archived the waveform and, on a whim, ran it through an audio spectrum analyzer. A thin notch appeared at seven kilohertz, an almost silent ring that cut through the noise floor. When I looped the file at low volume, the notch hummed like a name.


Patterns gathered like lint on a coat. Each missing person had a thread: a time, a place, a small digital artifact — a half-deleted post, a blurred surveillance still, a phone ping that stopped in an empty field. Those artifacts would dissolve when we tried to subpoena details. Court clerks reported files with redacted lines and signatures that matched no known employee. When detectives tried to serve a subpoena to the ISP holding certain logs, the company replied with an invoice and then closed the account. Billing addresses returned to post office boxes that never had tenants.


We brought in the cold cases unit, and they treated it like a puzzle worth obsession. They mapped the vanishings on a GIS, overlaying everything from soil surveys to utility cut maps. There were corridors of absence — swaths of town where missing reports concentrated like storm cells. But when we tried to pin the pattern onto physical reality, we found our lines fell through like grain on a sieve. Subcontractor maps showed conduits that ended in gray shadings. Geotech surveys had areas labeled ""anomalous"" with cursory notes: ""low density; no significant strata."" The more we looked, the more our city became an atlas of empty margins.


I began dreaming of a room with blank walls and white chairs. When I woke, my hands were cramped from holding a pen as if to write names down. There were names I couldn't shake. They came as phrases whispering inside my head, like someone trying to recall a forgotten route. I'd open a binder and find the name not there, or worse, found a phantom entry with a different occupation and a different social security that led to a dead-end.


One detective, Reyes, began keeping a private notebook. He wrote names in the margins, circled them, drew lines between them like constellations. He kept little things: a torn ticket stub, a receipt from a diner, a pressed leaf. He swore the items were real because he could hold them. But friends who'd known the missing swore those things belonged to memories that had never been spoken aloud. Reyes started to talk about the way time shivered, how some memories felt ""unfurnished."" He'd come into the bullpen and say, with a laugh that didn't meet his eyes, ""Sometimes I can't tell if I'm looking for people or for permissions to remember them.""


Then came the mother whose son had been gone for nine months. She brought in a shoebox of his things: drawings, a keychain, a crumpled receipt for video games. She sat across from me in the quiet interview room and told me about the boy's favorite line from a movie. She spoke in present tense, and the words made a nest in the air. We ran numbers, tax records; we found a toddler's birth certificate but nothing in school records beyond kindergarten. The mother cried and held the paper close. I reached to take the receipt and felt its edges dissolve under my fingers, like dried petals.


We started getting calls from other cities, then from neighboring counties. The pattern wasn't local. A park in another state reported a cluster of disappearances over a span of ten years that matched our shape: small, precise, and never ending in bodies. I spoke with a dispatcher in that town. He sounded older, worn thin by the logic of absence. He'd kept a corkboard like a shrine of names. He told me he had found photographs in family albums with faces sunfaded away, and he asked me if I had ever tried to remember a face so hard it blurred out of existence. I told him yes. He told me that at night, he sometimes hears callers ask, “Do you remember me?” and he never knows whether to say yes.


The city appointed an interagency task force. We pulled in external forensic labs, academic consultants, archivists, and a psychologist who specialized in memory disorders. She ran cognitive tests on relatives who insisted their missing were real. Most scored normal, but their memories of the missing were surrounded by what she termed ""episodic erosion"" — rich, sensory recollections that lacked corroborating metadata. She asked if we had checked the city's cadastral records for anomalies. We had, and they came back clean, but a junior analyst found a set of parcel records that referenced parcels that never mapped to any coordinate system. They were labeled with names that matched people we were investigating. The analyst put them in a folder on his desk and, the next morning, swore they were gone.


At some point, a pattern in the calls turned less like a map and more like a rhythm. Callers began reporting the same odd preface: a metallic tang in the air, a low pressure like a glass tumbler filled halfway, a sense of being observed through thin fabric. I started logging that sensory phrase with the incident reports. Crews reported the sensation too. EMTs described the air as if it had been chewed down by something that wasn't meant to be inhaled.


An evidence tech recorded one of these scenes. She filmed a residential kitchen where a missing man had last been seen. The camera panned the room: plates stacked, a dog asleep, a calendar turned to May. Then the film showed a corner where the wallpaper had a faint square scar — a place that looked like an old photograph once lived there. When they enhanced the footage, the square glowed slightly and, for a single frame, an outline of a person's face appeared as if someone had pressed a palm to glass. The tech printed the frame and placed it in an evidence envelope. That envelope subsequently failed to show up during a court subpoena.


The families began to fracture in different ways. Some withdrew and kept the missing alive in private rituals — candles on porches at dusk, birthday cakes with one empty seat. Others tried to reclaim their lives, even as the unspooling ledger of absences threaded through their days. One woman painted over all of her son's murals in soft gray and then, a week later, woke to find one tiny corner of sky unpainted, blue as forgiveness. She told me she didn't do it. She'd been sleeping.


We brought in a specialist in data integrity to audit our servers. He sat in our server room and looked exhausted after two days. He said things like, ""You can't erase whole people from distributed ledgers without leaving hash residue,"" and then, after a long silence, ""But there are ways to make a thing ephemeral that don't behave like deletion."" He showed us traces — bits of corrupted UDP packets that resembled signatures but pointed nowhere. He drew a diagram with arrows that looped into themselves. He called the pattern ""an entropy seam."" He said the only way he'd ever seen anything like it was in archival systems damaged by cosmic rays — random, high-energy events that flip bits and make reality jitter.


We questioned cosmic rays for days, because the alternative — some human agency engineering selective absence — was a kind of government-freezer nightmare. Engineers came from the university and they measured radiation and electromagnetic fields. Everything read normal. We tested for chemical agents. Negative. We inventoried the power grid. Nothing. Still, the seam knotted the city.


The morning the mayor called, the newsroom and the station turned into a kind of animal panic. He wanted answers. He wanted a narrative. We had none we trusted. I consolidated reports and handed them up the chain. He looked at me and said, quietly, ""Find them."" I looked back and felt my voice thin. ""We are,"" I said. It felt like a promise I could not keep.


The strange calls continued. Once, a little girl called 911 to report her imaginary friend had been taken by a ""paper wind."" She sounded certain. Officers found crumpled paper at the edge of a playground — nothing else. Another caller insisted his neighbor had shrunk like a photograph. He described opening a closet and finding a coat hanging with its hanger empty, the outline of a man pressed into the fabric. The officer who checked the closet later refused to talk about what he saw. He took time off and moved to another county.


And then, in the middle of a Monday, we received a call that made every hair on my arms stand up. It was a recording from a call we had logged months earlier. The voice was my own — not the dispatcher who had answered then, but me. The time stamp matched our server time, and yet I knew I had not made the call. On the recording, I asked a woman who had reported a missing child, ""Do you remember me?"" and the woman answered me in a voice I had never heard before. She said, ""We asked you once. You said no."" The line ended with a click. We played it for a lab technician and he said, ""That's not possible. You weren't on duty."" But I was. I listened to myself ask a question I didn't remember asking.


We started to ask callers that question, quietly, in the gaps when background noise allowed: ""Do you remember me?"" It felt obscene, like leaning over a fresh grave. Some laughed, thinking we were playing a joke. Others answered with confusion. A few, hushed, said yes. One man whispered, ""Yes, I've always remembered you."" Then he asked why he couldn't find his wife's graduation photo in the album anymore. He asked why his son's preschool name tag had a smear where the name once had been stitched. He told us his daughter had been missing for three years and yet he could still taste the peppermint from her Halloween candy on his tongue like a small, private compass.


We tried, for a time, to be clinical. We logged everything. We cross-referenced. We wrote memos and sent them up the ladder and then watched them evaporate from shared drives. Memoranda became footnotes. A lieutenant told me in a hallway that his own sister had been the first to disappear when he was a child. He told me his memories of her were like vellum you could fold and crease: they retained shape, but they could not be scanned. ""We guard the not-having,"" he said. ""Maybe that's what it is. We guard the not-having.""


Months passed and the cases cooled into a new normal where a missing person case meant a different kind of work. We became archivists of doubt. Officers reassigned to these files learned to listen for the seam. We set up a special number for family meetings, a line where people could tell us about the folks they missed and where we would collect sensory details that never fit in formal reports: a laugh that liked the low notes, a preference for mint toothpaste, a limp from a soccer injury at eleven. Detectives cataloged those details like traits of endangered species, small things to look for if the world ever allowed them to be seen again.


Then a cluster of calls came in over a single weekend like a chorus. People reported seeing the same man in disparate places: on a freeway overpass, in a laundromat, in the back row of a church. He never stayed long. Witnesses who swore they had seen him gave the same description: a gray coat, a small scar by the eyebrow, hands that smelled faintly of metal. We circulated an APB and put his face on a missing poster. Families called, asking if this could be their missing. No one came forward. The man began to appear in urban legends on message boards — “the gray man” — and the sightings proliferated with the exact sameness you see in memes. There were so many reports that for a week our center was full of calls asking if we had found him.


On a Tuesday, a patrol found him crouched under an awning in a side street. He was older than any description suggested and wore a coat that looked moth-eaten. When officers called his name, he looked up like someone who had been interrupted reading. He had no ID, no memory of a hometown, no matching records. He spoke once, in a voice like a wind through keyholes: ""They forget because they have to."" He said it like a fact, like weather. When detectives tried to run him through the system, his prints returned noise. The fingerprint database returned a checksum error. We put him into protective custody and called the hospital. After four hours, a nurse called to tell us his wristband label had been smudged away. The intake sheet later read ""Unknown — patient refused ID."" We left him in a room with a single window. The next morning, the bed was made as if by careful hands. The man was gone.


We do not have an explanation. We have hypotheses that stack into each other like unstable shelves. Maybe it's a localized phenomenon of narrative entropy — the world prefers some fact",1,1767043510.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1pyylzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pyylzs/is_this_really_how_it_feels/,Is this really how it feels?,"I want to preface this post by saying that I am NOT complaining. This last year has been rough for alot of people and I completely acknowledge that I have a lot to be grateful for.

I’ve been working in my industry for a little over a decade. I’m 33 F and I work in somewhat of a male dominated industry. Anyway, I started at my current job in 2023 thanks to a referral by a friend. In less than a year I was promoted three times and am now a Senior Account Executive. I love what I do and I’ve made so many connections and friends in the industry. Unfortunately I find that some connections that I thought would last burned bright and fizzled out quickly. People have come and gone from the company in the time that I’ve been there and i feel like I’m kind of tossed aside once their tenure is over. I guess I thought that I was building real genuine relationships and it just sucks to feel like the bond wasn’t strong enough to last with the changing tides.

There have been SEVERAL people that I’ve connected with in the last year that I pretty much no longer here from for one reason or the other. All of them have left the company either at their on will or have been fired. There is one situation in particular that really stung. This year I supervised a small team of three. We worked so well together and we really got close. I prided myself on being a good leader and example for them. They had no problem coming to me with any issues they were having, they respected my authority and we really built a bond. I let them get hands on experience by going out into the field, networking, traveling, and being pretty relaxed overall as long as they got their work done. One of the ladies that I felt had become a really good friend was dropping the ball on her responsibilities and had a major falling out with a client. After several other missteps on her end and several warnings, I had to make the very difficult decision to terminate her contract. I was heartbroken and so was she. I was even more heartbroken to hear that she had been telling some of the current employees that she somehow blamed me for how things played out. I reached out to her a few times after and offered to help in her search to find something that may be a better fit but she didn’t seem interested in my help. I saw her recently at an event and she did get a new role. She didn’t speak to me and avoided eye contact.

My most recent promotion allowed me the opportunity to move away from a position of management and into a role that was more independent. The girls that were on my team have also been moved to other teams. I gave up my office, as I am now hybrid (two days in office three days out) and have been focused on my new responsibilities. Since I am no longer in the office I noticed that the communication pretty much has stopped. The other teams have really fostered a closeness with eachother and I just don’t feel like I’m a part of that anymore. I don’t know if I truly feel left out but I guess just….isolated. I understand that they acknowledge that I’m in a different position of authority now but I guess I atleast thought that they would still see me as personable and a part of the team. I try to be as approachable as possible. Still offering snack, coffee runs, and inviting them to attend industry events with me but no one bites. I sometimes pop into their side of the building to say hello and the vibe is so different. I’ve been told by several of them that I am missed and it just isn’t the same without me there but it doesn’t seem like it honestly.

Some of my close friends outside of work have also drifted. I feel guilty talking about work or my accomplishments because they didn’t seem to want to hear it. I really don’t take up alot of space. I’m the friend who listens the majority of the time, and allow others to take up as much space and talk about themselves as much as they want. I started to feel foolish when I would mention a trip I was taking for work or something that I was really proud of and would be met with silence. I’ve had to make the really tough choice to kind of back away from some relationships because they no longer felt balanced.

At this point I’m ranting. Again- I’m not complaining. I love what I do and I wouldn’t change it for the world but I guess I expected my social circle to grow as I expanded…not shrink.",2,1767043401.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

This community and r/JapanTravel helped me a lot while planning our trip so I thought it was time to post a trip report.

It was a roughly two week trip from July 14th through July 30th of 2024. There were 9 of us on this trip, 3 couples and 3 solo travelers. We booked all of the travel and hotels through Tripmasters, who I really can't recommend enough. It ended up being about $2700 including insurance for our flights, hotels, and Shinkansen tickets for Osaka-Kyoto and Kyoto-Tokyo. We paid around $100 for a shuttle from Osaka International Airport to our hotel, which we ended up getting refunded for due to travel issues. Always pay for insurance!

It's a long one, apologies!

Day 1

We flew out of Dulles in Virginia to Montreal, easy flight. Then our hour and a half layover turned into a 7 hour delay, which is a great way to start a trip you've been planning for a while. We got food vouchers from the Air Canada and were on the phone with Tripmasters figuring out what to about our connecting flight from Tokyo-Osaka that we were absolutely going to miss. Other than the stress of not knowing what was going to happen when we landed in Tokyo, the flight wasn't as awful as I would have expected. I was able to get up and walk around a little bit to stretch, read my book, played a game, and sleep a little. We landed at Narita around Midnight and we all met up at customs/baggage. Air Canada got us a shuttle bus to Haneda and a hotel for the night, which I believe was the Hotel Villa Fontaine Grand Haneda Airport. It was a very nice hotel for the four hours of sleep we got.

Day 2

Our new flight to Osaka was at 7:30 AM. We freshened up and met up with everyone at the airport, which was a short walk. Hit up our first konbini, grabbed some snacks, and were in the air without any issues. A nice bonus was that our plane was a Star Wars plane with a C-3PO wrap and seat covers. Landed in Osaka and got our baggage, then grabbed a bus to the station nearest to our hotel. We had booked a shuttle van so we wouldn't have to jump right into public transit, but with the delay that was cancelled and we got our first experience with walking in the Japan Summer. Growing up in the Southern US I thought I would be prepared even after reading how hot and humid it was and boy howdy I was wrong. Drink all of the water. You think you've drank enough? Wrong. Drink more. We stayed at the Dotonbori Crystal Hotel, which was amazing. Just a few blocks from the canal and everything that goes with it, but just far enough that it was nice and quiet. Great room, great service.

We met my sister at the hotel, and originally the plan was to take the first day to relax, but we essentially lost that day and got rested up in Tokyo, so we hit the ground running. Two of our group split off to meet some friends who were on a separate trip, another couple walked around Osaka, the rest of us headed to Takurazuka to check out the Osamu Tezuka Museum. Takurazuka is a beautiful city. Gorgeous views of the mountains and rivers and a lovely way for us to get used to Japan. The museum is a must visit if you're a fan of Tezuka and the staff were so nice. After we stopped in a small park to have lunch and a group of schoolgirls cautiously came up to us to practice their English. Adorable.

Day 3

We bummed around Dotonbori, checked out the Donki, went to Osaka Castle, then Den Den Town. Didn't go in the castle, just wasn't feeling it at the time, but the grounds are pretty amazing to walk around. Den Den Town was cool. I don't collect retro games any more but it was cool to see a lot of stuff that I love. The Dragon Quest Lawson was a fun treat to happen upon. A few of the group hit the wall this night and called it early. This was the night that kicked off me and my girlfriend never really being hungry for most of the trip. We were both looking forward to the food but outside of a snack here and there we were rarely hungry enough for a meal.

Day 4

Took the train to Kobe then the bus to Nijigen No Mori for the Godzilla zipline and Dragon Quest Island. The bus had a Dragon Quest wrap so we knew were headed in the right direction. If you go to Nijigen No Mori, make sure you get out at the huge parking lot. Don't be an idiot like me and assume the bus goes up to the theme park area like I did because it's further away on your map. Yeah, we missed the stop and got off at the next one which was a bench on the side of the highway and had to catch the next bus back. The walk through the park to the nerd areas is worth going to Nijigen No Mori on its own. Beautiful gardens, delightful folks tending them, and stunning views of the river and forest.

The Godzilla zipline was everything I wanted it to be. We got to watch a really fun video(In the AC!) on how they trapped Godzilla on Awaji Island and find out our objectives while ziplining. We got harnessed up and I went first. They give you a little necklace for your phone so you can film yourself ziplining, but my video was awful haha. Luckily my friend was too big to zipline and got video of all of us going into Godzilla's mouth. My girlfriend was super nervous but she was the second to go and did it like a champ! After that you get to do a fun laser gun game shooting cells on Godzilla's side, then on to the gift shop! Did I buy a lot of stuff here? Yes. Yes I did. The Godzilla cafe was fun too. Cute food that was pretty tasty for a theme park.

Then we headed to Dragon Quest Island which was a ton of fun. We were split into two groups and you get to pick your character type and go off as your own jrpg adventuring party. The first bit you walk around town looking for money to buy equipment, then you head off into the wilderness to fight monsters. We had paid for the extra side mission, but most of us were pretty wiped by the heat so we skipped it. It wasn't too terribly expensive so I didn't feel like we lost too much. The final boss fight is really fun. If you like Dragon Quest you gotta check this out.

  
Leaving the park and getting back to Osaka was another adventure. By the time we were leaving there  were no buses from the parking lot back across the bridge to Kobe. There's a huge rest area kinda thing across the highway that we were hoping had a bus stop, so we had to figure out how to get there. Crossing a huge highway was out of the question, so this was when we figured out something about Japan. You may not see it at first, but if you want to get somewhere, there is a way. The way we found was a small path that led under both highways to the rest area, which did not have a bus stop, but there was one between the two highways, which we eventually figured out and got back to Osaka, tired but happy.

  
Day 5 

Another day bumming around Osaka. We found a laundromat near the hotel and we may have been the last people to use it. My sister dropped her stuff off and went for a walk. When she came back to toss her clothes in the dryer, an old man was ripping every machine out and tossing it in the back of a truck. So her clothes were air dried at the hotel. My girlfriend and I went to go to Namba Yasaka shrine, which was closed by the time we got there, but we found a really cool indie record shop/bar on the way and hit a beautiful nature walk near a mall.

  
Day 6

  
We got up early to hit up Namaba Yasaka shrine, which was totally worth going back for, then took the Shinkansen to Kyoto. This was an easy day of resting in our hotel, the Chisun Standard Horikawa Gojo, which was nice enough, once we figured out how the AC worked, then heading into Kyoto for dinner. We had too large of a group for most places so we split up. Our group ended up at nice little hole in the wall with good food, then we were in bed early because that wall was coming for us.

  
Day 7

  
My girlfriend, my sister, and I checked out two gorgeous temples, then a garden, then Kyoto Tower. The temples were  one of the main things my girlfriend was looking forward to, and they did not disappoint other than an influencer and her boyfriend not taking their shoes off in the right area and filming their content in front of one of the big statues inside. The garden was beautiful and had one of my favorite signs of the entire trip, ""Be careful of the bee"".

  
That night we went near Gion to see the floats, and this is where I officially hit the wall. Tired caught up to me, the crowds became a bit too much with folks coming to a dead stop for no reason I could see, and the traditional flutes and bells were not what my ears wanted to hear at the moment, so I headed back to the hotel and crashed out. Missed out on going to Fushimi Inari at night with everyone but I was beat. There's always next time.

  
Day 8

  
My girlfriend and I wanted a day that was just us so we decided to check out the Sagano Romantic Train. This was easily my highlight of Kyoto. This was the hottest day of the trip, and luckily we got tickets for the open air car, so we at least had a breeze going. The views on the train ride are drop dead gorgeous. Riding along the river and seeing the beautiful forests is just unreal. When we got off at the station, our plan was to take a horse drawn carriage to the Hozugawa River Cruise company, but we missed the shuttle and decided to walk to the next station and wander our way there. I'm glad we did because we had a lovely walk along a path that crossed rice fields with a gorgeous view of the surrounding valley.

  
If you take the Sagano Romantic Train, I can't recommend taking the Hozugawa River on your way back in enough. The ride is incredible, you get to see some stunning nature along the way, and the guides are so friendly and hilarious. We had three guides who swapped out spots as we went, and each guy was unique and so much fun. We got off at Arishiyama, met up with our friends, had lunch, checked out the bamboo grove, then headed back to the hotel to pack up and get some much needed rest.  As beautiful as the day was, the humidity was BRUTAL and wiped us out.

  
Day 9

  
We took the Shinkansen to Tokyo, checked into our hotel, the APA Hotel Higashi Nihombashi Ekimae, which was pretty nice other than the AC turned off whenever you left, so every time you got back you had to bring the temperature down again. That evening we headed to Ribera Steakhouse, a place I had wanted to visit since I was a teenager. 2024 was my last year in the wrestling business, and going to a place that EVERY wrestler I have ever liked has eaten at, as well as a lot of my friends who aren't with us anymore, was a little emotional. The steak was pretty damn good too! As a bonus, I ran into Mad Man Pondo there. I hadn't seen him in a few years so it was nice to say hi and text an old friend to tell him he said hi. Unless you're on tv, you're not getting their special jacket for free anymore. I bought a shirt and gave them an 8x10 anyway just to say I did it. They probably threw it away as soon as I left, but I don't care haha.

  
Day 10

  
We took a bus to Gotemba Station to attempt climbing Mt. Fuji. My sister is an avid hiker and met up with her friends from back home to climb the next day on a different trail, and out group headed up to Subashiri 5th Station. We started the day a little later than we probably should have, and after taking an hour to acclimate, we hit the trail. We had been prepping for a long time, but this kicked most of our asses. Oxygen sickness is a real thing. Two of the people in our group have some heart issues and a few others of us were sucking wind the whole way. The views were amazing, but we struggled the last hour or so on the way to the 6th Station. One of our group went ahead to let the station know we were coming and not dead, and we crawled in a little after curfew and went right to sleep. 

Day 11

The next morning we knew we weren't going to make it to the top, but we saw the sunrise from a pretty good place outside of our hut. I didn't appreciate at the time because I felt like garbage and climbing Fuji was something I had been planning on for a few years, so getting that close only to not make it hurt. I'd like to try it again sometime and do a few things differently.

  
We headed back down tot he 5th Station to catch the bus back to Gotemba, and then my luck/stupid brain struck again. And again. We got to the 5th Station around 8:45, and the next bus was at 9. My ticket was in my passport wallet and oh my god where is my passport? After having a minor, ok maybe not so minor panic attack, and taking everything out of my backpack, texting everyone still at the 6th Station, we found that somehow it had ended up in my girlfriend's backpack. So we get on the bus, exhausted and a little stressed.

  
At Gotemba Station we ran into an American family whose daughter goes to school in the small town I'm from, which was a pretty cool thing. Then we're looking at the schedule for the buses back to Tokyo and god dammit I lost my passport again. Feeling pretty stupid, I walked back through the station while my girlfriend went and got coffee, probably while telling everyone how stupid I am. The lady at the bus station explained the bus we had taken down the mountain wouldn't be back for another hour so I had to wait. When the bus arrived, the hikers were lined up to get on and the driver got out holding the waterproof bag my passport was in! After apologizing and thanking him profusely, I went back through the station again to find my girlfriend and apologize to her as well.

  
While I was gone she went to Picasso-Do, a cute little coffee shop across from the bus stop and was telling me about the owner, an older man who had once been a photography professor at a university. She sent me to get her another coffee to make up for being an idiot, and I met the man, who was as nice as could be. He was napping in a seat in the sunlight through the back door, so I had to wake him up, and we had a delightful conversation. He had antique cameras in a case behind the counter, and while preparing the coffee he asked where I was from and began to list off his favorite US movie directors and movies that took place in my home state of Virginia. Just a delight all around and put my mind at ease after being so stressed. We took the bus back to Tokyo and had an early night after doing laundry.

Day 12

We slept in then headed to Senso-ji and took in the sights there. My girlfriend loves tanukis so we walked down the tanuki street and found the nearby tanuki temple. We picked up some souvenirs at the stalls near Senso-ji then met up with our friends after dropping everything off at the hotel. That evening we headed to Akihabara, and everything you have heard about it is true. Is it touristy? Yes. Are some items a little pricier? Sure. Is it a lot of fun? Yes. 

Bic Camera was a great place to pick up gifts for folks back home and a cool place to see cool gadgets and fancy tvs if that's your thing. I enjoyed the Mandarake here more that the one in Den Den Town in Osaka, but that may be because it felt like their doujinshi section was bigger. I could have spent all day there finding cool manga and random art, proven more by everyone in my group leaving one by one while I kept digging. I was alos able to pick up some games a friend had been after for awhile, which was cool.

  
I love crane games so we spent a little bit hoping around from arcade to arcade. I tried a few of the money sink games that aren't the standard ufo claw, and they were fun. I was able to win a mofusando shark cat for my girlfriend fairly quickly, which she loved. After that we hit up a few statue/figure shops for gifts then called it a night.

  
Day 13

  
We headed to Gotokuji Temple, which is supposed to be the birthplace of the lucky cat legend/statue. This was a gorgeous temple tucked away in a neighborhood, very unassuming from the outside. Inside there were thousands of lucky cat statues of all sizes. You can buy the size you want there and leave it with a prayer, so there were tiny ones tucked in everywhere, and a section with huge groups of them. We decided to take ours to go as a souvenir. I would love to visit this one again.

  
Later that evening we had tickets to a baseball game at the Meiji Jingu Stadium, so my girlfriend and I decided to walk through Meiji Jingu Shrine and park on our way there. This is another place I'd love to revisit with more time. We passed a lot of beautiful gardens on our way through, and the shade was a great way to get out of that sun for a little bit.

  
In our large group, my best friend was the only sports fan, and the number one thing he wanted to do was check out a ball game. I'm glad he brought it up because it ended up being one of the highlights of the entire trip. Meiji Jingu is a gorgeous open air stadium that has been around forever. Babe Ruth played there! We made sure to get seats in the cheering section and watched the home team Yakult Swallows beat the Hiroshima Carp.

That game was everything I had heard about Japanese baseball and more. Every player from each team had a special song the crowd would sing, there was a guy leading the chants with a card for each song, guys with drums and trumpets, it was incredible. We were behind a family who adopted us for the game, letting us know when fireworks were about go off after the fifth inning, lending my girlfriend a small umbrella for the Umbrella Dance after each home run, and telling us to stay and watch the post game interviews. On our way back to the hotel we hit up Shibuya Crossing which, for me, was pretty unimpressive. I did like the Hachi statue though.



Day 14

We hit up the Junji Ito Enchantment exhibition, which was amazing. As a long time fan of his work, it was unreal getting to see the original art for so many famous pages in person. Pick a Junji Ito scene you love and they had the original art. So cool. I could have easily spent every cent I had in the gift shop, but this was the priciest spot of the entire trip. There was a beautiful Tomie satin baseball jacket, but I just couldn't swing the $500 price tag.  

That evening we went to Shinjuku to see the Godzilla head at the Gracery hotel. We lucked out and got there right as the music and sounds began to play, which was really fun to see from the street. We headed up the the hotel lobby hoping to get some photos on the balcony outside, but it was closed to the public. We had dessert at the hotel bar instead, which included a solid chocolate Godzilla which was tasty but took some gnawing to get through, then watched the show again from inside as the sun went down.

Day 15

For our final day we hit up the Ghibli Museum, the main thing my girlfriend and a few others in our group wanted to see in Tokyo. I'm not a diehard Ghibli fan, but it really was a cool place. The zoetrope is worth the price of admission alone. I loved the art everywhere and the general feel of the place. Walking there and back through the park was lovely as well.



That night we had one of our only big meals and the best meals of the trip at Nihonbashi Philly. We had seen things on social media about this man from Japan who loved Philadelphia so much that he opened a cheesteak joint in Tokyo, and as a former Philly resident and cheesesteak snob I had to check it out. My girlfriend was looking forward to sushi afterward for her last meal of the trip, but as soon we walked in she couldn't resist the smell and got a chicken cheeseteak that she loved. My friend and I each got a classic cheesesteak and I can say with zero doubt that Kosuke makes the best cheesesteak I have ever had. His wife Tomomu makes the bread and cheese sauce, which are both spectacular, and the steak is cooked to perfection. I brought him a Mitchell & Ness Eagles hat and a shirt, which he loved and immediately put on before taking photos with us. After saying goodbye we were taking photos out front and  Tomomu came out and gave us each a sticker and tea that they wouldn't be releasing until the following week! Whenever a thread pops up on where to eat in Tokyo, this will always be my recommendation.

  
Day 16

  
Headed home! After packing everything in our checked and carry on bags, we made a last konbini stop then took the train to Narita. Our bags were juuuuuuuust over the weight limit so I had to frantically repack everything at the counter, which was fun. So fun. The flight home was a little rougher than the flight there. I was between an old man who slept the entire flight and my girlfriend and a friend, so I wasn't able to get up as much and had to try and get some sleep and read when I could. Easy connecting flight in Montreal then a quick flight back to Dulles, and before you know it we were home safe. Sleep wasn't happening so we stayed up late unpacking everything and coming down off of that vacation high.

  
Quick tips/thoughts/whatever

  
\-Any issue we had with travel woes, Tripmasters was on it very quickly. We were able to get a refund on the missed shuttle and the missed first night at the hotel in Osaka within a week or so of getting home.

\-Yes, konbinis rule. We all know it.

\-I never had an issue finding a trash can. If we got a snack at the konbini, we ate it our front then tossed our trash inside. Almost every vending machine has recycling right there for your empty bottles or cans. If I had extra trash for whatever reason, I always had a backpack. Stow it in a pocket until we got to a trash can or back to the hotel.

 \-I did Duolingo for 4 years leading up to the trip, my sister and best friend did zero prep, and we were all fine. Most folks seemed to appreciate us trying to speak a little Japanese, but Arigato Gozaimasu and sumimasen go a long way.

\-Read the room. If the train's quiet, be quiet. If everyone's chatting, you'll probably be fine chatting.

\-I missed getting a Suica card, but didn't really have any issues paying at each stop. It was a pretty minor hassle.

\-We never really experienced any xenophobia other than an older man in Osaka mumbling ""Gaijin"" in Den Den Town and a couple switching seats on a bus in Kyoto. Like anywhere else in the world, we tried to be respectful and not act like assholes.

\-Wander! Can't recommend it enough. We had things planned just about every day, but some of my favorite times were the walks between what we had planned.

  
Thanks for reading, sorry it's a long one. I'd be happy to answer any questions if you're going around the same time I did.

1pyykup,https://i.redd.it/8uqehqrpm7ag1.png,Lyam & Hunter's Family Tree (my art),"i really like creating these family trees for my ocs. it's a bundle of fun :D character descriptions below.

>Félix LeGrand - Lyam and Hunter’s father. A pleasant, well-meaning man who was rarely home. His job kept him traveling constantly, sometimes gone for months and only stopping in briefly before leaving again. Because of this, he never formed a close bond with either of his sons and often feels more like a stranger than a parent.

>Felicity LeGrand (née Prescott) - Lyam and Hunter’s mother. Extremely doting… toward Lyam, at least. With Félix always away, Felicity became lonely and emotionally dependent on her children. When Lyam was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, she focused almost all of her attention on him, unintentionally neglecting Hunter. She doesn’t see herself as manipulative, but often guilt-trips her sons without realizing it (“You’re leaving for college? So you’re just going to abandon your mother?”). Hunter deeply resents his mother for how he was often neglected.

>Hunter LeGrand - Cool, polished, and always camera-ready, Hunter is the most successful of the LeGrand sons. He’s an award-winning movie star who loves the wealth and attention that come with fame, and he knows exactly how to work a crowd. Acting comes easily to him, both on screen and off. To the public, he’s charming and laid-back. In reality, he’s sarcastic, self-serving, and manipulative. He’s cut off almost his entire family, only seeing Lyam on rare occasions. He resents both of his parents and finds them more irritating than anything else. Beneath his arrogance, though, Hunter is deeply lonely, coping with it through expensive alcohol and his volatile relationship with Kairi. Attention from her, good or bad, is still attention.

>Kairi Kurosawa – Hunter’s on-again, off-again lover and a famous actress in her own right, known for taking on a wide range of roles. She’s quiet, calculating, and strong-willed, always presenting herself as perfect. In reality, she constantly feels like she isn’t doing enough and struggles to live up to her father’s impossible expectations. Kairi hates Hunter just as much as she loves him. She knows their relationship is unhealthy, but she can’t deny how deeply addicted she is to him.

>Lyam LeGrand - A sweet, gentle, well-meaning guy who loves art, science, and taking care of his plants. He wears his heart on his sleeve and is a hopeless romantic. While he works as a fashion model (a career his parents pushed him into as a child) he mostly sticks with it because it’s familiar and pays well. His real passion is botany, and he’s a full-time student working toward that future. Dalila is his entire world. He can be a bit overprotective at times, but his love for her is genuine. The two eventually marry and go on to have twins.

>Dalila LeGrand (née Sucré) - A baker’s daughter through and through, Dalila lives up to her last name. She’s sweet, warm, and almost always smells faintly like vanilla. She’s an amateur fashion designer currently working as an assistant at a major fashion company, dreaming of the day she’ll run her own brand instead of fetching coffee for models and executives. Dalila tends to overthink and stress about the small stuff, and her anxiety can get the best of her, but Lyam helps ground her when things spiral. She adores him completely. The two eventually marry and go on to have twins.

>Eloise LeGrand - The older twin by a few minutes. She’s fiery, stubborn, and confident. Eloise loves dresses, sparkles, and anything traditionally “girly,” but she’s just as happy playing in the mud or throwing herself into rough contat sports. She is loud, fearless, and impossible to boss around. As far as she is concerned, she's the boss!

>Louis LeGrand - The younger twin and the calmer of the two. He’s gentle, soft-spoken, and far more well-behaved than his sister. Louis loves ballet and singing, and tends to avoid conflict whenever he can. Though he is emotional and sensitive, he is deeply kind.",3,1767043327.0,furry,1,1.0,False

I’ve been trying small things that actually stick, like setting one tiny goal for the morning and rewarding myself when I finish it, and it honestly feels way less overwhelming.

1pyyk3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1pyyk3l/i_went_urban_exploring_alone_someone_locked_the/,I Went Urban Exploring Alone. Someone Locked the Exits Behind Me.,"I am writing this on my phone with my left hand because my right one is wrapped in gauze and taped to a splint.

If you’re going to comment “don’t trespass,” save it. I already learned that part. I learned it with blood on a concrete floor and someone close enough behind me that I could smell cigarettes through my own panic.

I’m seventeen. I live in a town where nothing happens unless it’s the kind of nothing that ruins your week. My friends and I watch those urban exploring videos where people wander through dead malls and old factories and it looks quiet. Dusty. Empty. Sad.

This was not like that.

I went alone because I’m an idiot, and because my friends are all talk. “Yeah bro I’m down,” and then it’s “my mom said no” or “I got work.” I told myself I’d just go in, take a few pictures, and leave before midnight. I told myself I’d be smart.

I picked the Hollis Distribution Center because everyone in town knows it. Huge gray warehouse off the service road behind the old strip mall. When I was little, trucks were always coming and going. My dad used to point at it and say, “That’s where all your Christmas stuff sits before it gets delivered.”

It shut down last year. They chained the gates and put up No Trespassing signs that faded in the sun. People started saying it was empty, then people started saying kids were going in to tag it, then people started saying they heard generators at night.

That last part should have been my warning.

I parked at the back of the strip mall like I was going to the late movie, even though the theater has been closed for years. I took my backpack, my cheap headlamp, a flashlight, and my phone. I wore gloves because of broken glass and I felt stupid the whole time. Like I was dressing up as someone brave.

The service road was cracked and littered with shredded tire pieces. I could see the warehouse over the weeds, a long wall with loading bay doors like sealed mouths. No lights inside. No movement.

I found an opening at the far end where the chain link fence had been cut and bent back. Not ripped by a storm. Cut clean, like someone used tools and did it on purpose.

My stomach did that quick dip. The part of my brain that still works said go home.

Then the other part said it’s just other explorers.

I slipped through and walked along the wall, keeping my light off. The air smelled like wet cardboard and old oil. Somewhere, a loose metal sign clinked softly in the wind.

There was a side door, steel, with a push bar. It had a fresh scrape near the handle, shiny where paint had been rubbed off. I pushed.

It opened without resistance.

Inside, my phone didn’t “fade” to no service. It just flipped to SOS and then to nothing, like the building swallowed it. I told myself it was the thick concrete and all the metal. Warehouses are dead zones. I’ve lost signal in my own school stairwell.

Still, the timing made my skin prickle.

The silence hit right after, big and flat.

The first room was an office area with glass panes and dusty desks. Someone had smashed a window and the glass had been swept into a neat pile in the corner. Not scattered. Not random. A neat pile, like whoever did it didn’t want to step on it.

There was a smell in there too. Not mold. Something sharper. Warmed plastic, and a faint tang like exhaust that didn’t belong in a room that was supposed to be cold and dead.

I moved deeper, past the office, into the main floor.

The warehouse opened up like an airplane hangar. Rows of empty shelving reached into the dark. Conveyor belts ran overhead, frozen in mid-motion, their rollers dull with dust. Yellow safety lines were painted on the concrete, worn from years of forklifts.

My flashlight caught a sign on a pillar about required PPE and forklift traffic. The kind of sign you don’t even see when you’re working because it’s just there.

Then I saw fresh boot prints.

Near a side entrance where mud had dried in a streak, there were clear treads. Wide heel. Recent enough that the mud was still darker than the concrete around it.

I stopped and listened.

Nothing.

Then, far off, something clicked.

Not the random pop of a settling building. A deliberate click, like a switch.

I whispered, “Hello?” which was the dumbest thing I could have done because it told whoever was in there that I was real and I was alone.

No answer.

I kept walking anyway, slower, trying to find the obvious “people hang out here” spot. That’s what those videos always show. Spray paint cans. A mattress. Beer bottles.

I found something worse.

Near the center of the building, under one of the conveyor lines, there was a folding chair facing a blank wall. Just one chair, centered like it was placed for a reason. On the floor in front of it were three chalk marks in a little triangle, like someone had been measuring distance.

On the chair was a cheap set of ear protection, the kind you’d wear around loud machinery.

My throat tightened.

I backed up without thinking, my heel scraping concrete.

From somewhere in the dark, a sound answered my scrape. A soft shuffle. One step. Then stillness.

I killed my flashlight and froze.

Total dark.

I listened so hard my ears hurt.

Breathing. My own. Too loud.

Then I heard it again.

Another step.

Closer.

I turned my flashlight back on and swung it across the aisles, trying to catch movement.

Nothing.

But the feeling changed. The warehouse didn’t feel empty anymore. It felt occupied. Like the air had shifted around a body.

I started walking back the way I came, fast but trying not to run. Running in a warehouse is how you fall into a hole or hit your head and nobody finds you.

I passed the office again and aimed for the side door.

The door was closed.

It had been open. I knew it had. I could still picture the push bar.

Now it was shut, and the thin gap of light under it was gone.

I reached for it, pulled, and the door didn’t budge.

Locked.

My hand went numb around the handle.

I tugged harder. Nothing.

I put my shoulder into it. Metal rang. Still nothing.

That was the moment the fear got simple. Not creepy fear. Survival fear.

Someone is in here with me, and they can lock doors.

I turned, scanning the office. There was a security desk near the hallway that led deeper into the building. On the desk was a clipboard with a paper that said VISITOR LOG at the top. It looked old, but the pen beside it didn’t. The pen was clean, like it had been placed that day.

I don’t know why I did it. My hands were shaking and I wanted them to do something that wasn’t yanking on a locked door.

I wrote my first name on the log. Just “Eli,” and the time. I didn’t even think. I wrote it like a joke, like I could laugh later about signing into a dead building.

The ink looked too dark on the page, too fresh.

I regretted it immediately.

I went down the hallway instead, trying to find another exit.

At the end of the hall was a stairwell door. I pushed it open.

Cold air hit my face. The stairwell smelled like wet cement and rust. Metal stairs went up to a second level, probably a maintenance mezzanine.

I stepped inside and pulled the door shut behind me.

The latch clicked.

Then, behind it, I heard a soft tap.

Knuckle on metal.

Once.

Then again, slow.

Tap.

Tap.

Not banging. Not trying to break in. Just letting me know they were there.

I backed up a step onto the stairs.

Tap.

Tap.

The tapping stopped.

A few seconds of nothing.

Then I heard the latch move on the other side. A quiet sliding sound.

The door handle turned.

It didn’t open. But it turned, like someone was testing it.

Then, very softly, a voice said from the other side, “You lost?”

It wasn’t a monster voice. It wasn’t a whispery ghost voice. It was a normal adult voice, calm and almost bored.

That terrified me more than anything.

I didn’t answer.

The voice sighed like I was inconveniencing them.

“Wrong place to be,” it said. “Come on. Let’s get you out.”

The words sounded helpful. The tone didn’t.

I backed up another step. My shoe scraped metal.

Silence.

I started up the stairs, faster now. The metal clanged under my feet. I hated every sound I made but I couldn’t stop.

Halfway up, the stairwell lights came on.

Not full bright. A flicker, then steady industrial glow. The kind you get when power comes to a place that’s supposed to be dead.

I froze, staring up at the fixture. Dust drifted through the light like slow snow.

Below me, the stairwell door clicked open.

I did not look back. I ran up the rest of the stairs and pulled myself onto the upper landing.

The upper level was a long catwalk running along the inside wall of the warehouse. Grated metal floor. Safety rail. From up there I could see almost everything below. Shelving rows. Conveyor belts. The chair.

And now I could see the generator.

A small portable generator sat tucked behind a stack of pallets near the far wall. The little fuel cap glinted in my beam. A heavy extension cord ran from it into a junction box. Someone had taped a label on the box with a strip of white tape and black marker. It said “LIGHTS / PA.”

My stomach dropped again.

Whoever was here didn’t just sneak in. They set up power on purpose. They planned to turn the building on when they wanted.

I heard footsteps on the stairs behind me.

Slow. Patient.

Like the person wasn’t worried about catching me because they already knew where I could and couldn’t go.

I moved along the catwalk, flashlight sweeping for a way down. There was a ladder in the distance, and a second stairwell on the far side.

I chose the ladder because it was closer.

My hands shook as I ran. The grate under my shoes made a hollow clatter. The warehouse threw the sound back at me.

The footsteps behind me stayed steady.

Not sprinting.

Just following.

I reached the ladder and started down. It was bolted to the wall and dropped to the floor near a row of shelving.

I was halfway down when something hit the catwalk above me.

A heavy thud, like a boot kicked the metal.

The ladder vibrated. My hands slipped.

I climbed faster. My glove caught on a sharp edge and tore. My bare palm scraped metal and pain flared.

I dropped the last few feet instead of climbing properly. My feet hit concrete hard. I stumbled forward, catching myself by slamming my shoulder into a shelf upright.

Above me, on the catwalk, a figure leaned on the rail and watched.

I only saw them for a second in my flashlight beam. Adult. Dark jacket. A headlamp on their forehead, but it was off. Face kept in shadow.

They didn’t yell. They didn’t threaten me.

They raised one hand, slow, and pointed toward the aisle in front of me like they were directing traffic.

I ran.

I wove between shelving, trying to use the rows like cover. I kept expecting them to jump down and chase me, but the footsteps stayed above for a bit, tracking, then stopped.

I couldn’t tell if that was good or worse.

I found a side exit door near one of the loading bays. It had a panic bar and a chain looped through the handles from the inside.

Not a normal chain. A thick one, like someone brought it from home. The padlock looked new, shiny, almost proud of itself.

I yanked the door anyway. The chain held.

I turned and looked for another way out, and that’s when the lights cut out.

Not gradually. Off.

Darkness snapped back in.

My flashlight was still on, but the warehouse swallowed the beam. Everything beyond a few yards was black.

Then the PA system crackled overhead.

A speaker popped and hissed, then a voice came through, slightly distorted.

A recording at first.

“Hello?”

Pause.

Then it said, “Eli.”

My knees went watery.

The name came again, clearer.

“Eli.”

I felt my stomach turn cold, because I knew exactly how it happened. I could see the clipboard. The pen. My own handwriting.

The calm voice returned, live this time.

“I told you it’s the wrong place,” it said. “Now you’re making noise. People hear noise.”

I spun in a slow circle, trying to see where the voice came from. It could have been anywhere.

My flashlight beam caught something hanging from a shelf upright.

A strip of reflective tape. Bright orange.

Then another on the next upright. And the next.

A path.

A line of orange markers, spaced just far enough apart to pull your eyes along the aisle.

The voice on the PA said, “Follow the tape. You’ll get out.”

It sounded like a test.

It sounded like a trap.

I did not follow the tape.

I turned and ran in the opposite direction.

That decision probably saved my life and it also got me hurt.

I sprinted down an aisle, cut left, then right, trying to head back toward the office windows. I figured even if the door was locked, I could break glass and crawl out. I didn’t care about trespassing charges anymore. I cared about daylight and people.

My flashlight beam bounced. Shadows jumped. Shelf columns turned into bodies for a split second and then steel again.

Then my foot caught something low across the floor.

I didn’t see it until it hit my shin.

It wasn’t a wire. It was a strap, like a ratchet strap laid across the aisle at ankle height, pulled tight.

My legs went out from under me.

I hit the concrete hard, shoulder first, then my face. My teeth clacked together so hard I thought one cracked.

My flashlight flew and spun, painting circles across the shelves.

Before I could scramble up, something heavy landed on my backpack and pinned it.

Not a boot on my spine. Not a knee on my neck. Just enough weight to trap me in place.

I bucked and twisted, trying to get free, and that’s when my right hand slid across something sharp.

Pain ripped through my palm. Real, hot pain.

Glass.

Someone had scattered broken glass right where you’d catch yourself.

I jerked my hand back and saw blood immediately, bright in the flashlight beam.

I tried to close my fingers. They didn’t listen right away.

Above me, the calm voice spoke, not through the PA this time.

Right behind my head.

“You really should’ve followed the tape.”

I couldn’t see him. My face was pressed to the floor. The flashlight was angled wrong. I could only see his shadow stretching across the concrete.

He didn’t sound excited. He sounded mildly annoyed, like I made his night harder.

I kicked backward. My heel hit something, maybe his shin, because the weight on my backpack shifted.

That tiny shift was all I needed. I yanked my arm free of the straps, crawled out of my backpack like I was shedding it, grabbed my flashlight, and ran one-handed.

Blood ran down my wrist into my glove. My hand throbbed in time with my heartbeat.

The PA system crackled again, and the live voice said, “Now you’re bleeding in my building.”

Like I owed him an apology.

I ran toward the office area, following memory, not tape. I could taste metal in my mouth. My ankle burned from the fall, but I couldn’t slow down.

I shoved through the office and saw the glass panes.

I raised my flashlight like a hammer and swung. The glass spiderwebbed but didn’t fall.

Safety glass.

Of course it was safety glass.

Footsteps hit the office threshold behind me, closer now.

I grabbed a chair and swung it into the glass again.

This time it shattered outward in thick chunks. The noise was insane in the small space.

Cold air rushed in.

I climbed up using my left hand and shoved my injured right through anyway because there was no other option. The broken edge tore my sleeve.

I dropped outside, landing wrong. My ankle rolled and pain shot up my leg. I almost went down again.

Behind me, the window popped as someone climbed through.

I ran anyway. I limped-run toward the bent fence opening, one hand clamped over my palm, leaving wet prints on my forearm.

Behind me, the calm voice called out, almost casually, “Eli.”

Not yelling. Not panicking. Calling like you call a dog that slipped its leash.

I got through the fence, scraping my back on the chain link. I didn’t care.

I hit the service road and stumbled toward the strip mall lights. My car was a dark shape at the far end. I fumbled the keys with my left hand and nearly dropped them twice.

I got inside and locked the doors so fast my fingers cramped.

For a second I just sat there, panting, staring at the warehouse in the distance.

Nothing moved.

No flashlight beam chased me across the road.

It was like the building swallowed him again.

I drove straight to the hospital. I didn’t stop. I didn’t call my friends. I didn’t call my mom until I was sitting under fluorescent lights with a paper wristband on and a nurse telling me not to look.

The waiting room smelled like coffee and antiseptic. A kid across from me had an ice pack pressed to his forehead and was trying not to cry. The TV was on a news channel with the volume down. Every few minutes a triage door opened and that same bright smell of disinfectant rolled out.

They cleaned my hand. The cut was deep enough that they asked me to try to curl my fingers and then looked at each other when my ring finger didn’t move right away. They numbed it and stitched it anyway. The numbing shot burned like fire for two seconds and then my palm felt huge and distant, like it belonged to someone else. They wrapped it tight and put my hand in a splint.

They X-rayed my ankle. Not broken, but bad enough that they wrapped it and handed me crutches.

While I sat there, still shaking, my phone buzzed.

A message request on an app I barely use anymore.

No profile picture. No name.

Just one line.

“You forgot something.”

That was it. No details. No proof. No photo.

It should have been nothing.

It made me feel sick anyway.

The police took a report. My mom was furious in the way people get when they’re scared and don’t know what else to do with it. The officer asked if I saw his face. I didn’t. I told them about the generator, the orange tape, the strap, the PA system, the chained doors.

I told them I signed the visitor log like an idiot.

The officer wrote it down and looked at me like he wanted it to fit into a neat box.

Trespasser. Squatter. Scrapper.

But those words don’t explain the tape path. They don’t explain the labeled junction box. They don’t explain the way he spoke to me like this was routine.

Two days later my friend drove past the warehouse in daylight, just to see if anything looked different.

He sent me pictures.

The cut fence had been fixed. Not patched. Replaced. New chain link, new ties, straight as a ruler. The side door I used was painted over, fresh gray paint like someone cared about the place suddenly. The No Trespassing signs were new too, crisp, with a phone number for a property management company.

There was also a new camera bubble mounted above the corner of the office wing, like the kind you see outside grocery stores. Maybe it was always there and I never noticed. Maybe it wasn’t.

My friend called the number out of curiosity. It went to a voicemail box that wasn’t set up.

Maybe it was just a guy who didn’t want kids in his building. Maybe it was someone running something illegal and I got too close.

I can live with that explanation, even if it makes my stomach turn.

What I can’t stop thinking about is how fast it all tightened around me.

I handed over my name because I wanted to pretend I wasn’t scared. And he used it like a leash.

So if you’re a kid like me and you see an “abandoned” building and you think it’s just a place to take pictures, listen.

If the glass is swept. If the doors lock from the inside. If the lights come on when you didn’t touch a thing.

Leave.

And if someone offers to “help you out” in a voice that’s too calm, do not answer.

1pyyjlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pyyjlw/i_went_urban_exploring_alone_someone_locked_the/,I Went Urban Exploring Alone. Someone Locked the Exits Behind Me.,"I am writing this on my phone with my left hand because my right one is wrapped in gauze and taped to a splint.

If you’re going to comment “don’t trespass,” save it. I already learned that part. I learned it with blood on a concrete floor and someone close enough behind me that I could smell cigarettes through my own panic.

I’m seventeen. I live in a town where nothing happens unless it’s the kind of nothing that ruins your week. My friends and I watch those urban exploring videos where people wander through dead malls and old factories and it looks quiet. Dusty. Empty. Sad.

This was not like that.

I went alone because I’m an idiot, and because my friends are all talk. “Yeah bro I’m down,” and then it’s “my mom said no” or “I got work.” I told myself I’d just go in, take a few pictures, and leave before midnight. I told myself I’d be smart.

I picked the Hollis Distribution Center because everyone in town knows it. Huge gray warehouse off the service road behind the old strip mall. When I was little, trucks were always coming and going. My dad used to point at it and say, “That’s where all your Christmas stuff sits before it gets delivered.”

It shut down last year. They chained the gates and put up No Trespassing signs that faded in the sun. People started saying it was empty, then people started saying kids were going in to tag it, then people started saying they heard generators at night.

That last part should have been my warning.

I parked at the back of the strip mall like I was going to the late movie, even though the theater has been closed for years. I took my backpack, my cheap headlamp, a flashlight, and my phone. I wore gloves because of broken glass and I felt stupid the whole time. Like I was dressing up as someone brave.

The service road was cracked and littered with shredded tire pieces. I could see the warehouse over the weeds, a long wall with loading bay doors like sealed mouths. No lights inside. No movement.

I found an opening at the far end where the chain link fence had been cut and bent back. Not ripped by a storm. Cut clean, like someone used tools and did it on purpose.

My stomach did that quick dip. The part of my brain that still works said go home.

Then the other part said it’s just other explorers.

I slipped through and walked along the wall, keeping my light off. The air smelled like wet cardboard and old oil. Somewhere, a loose metal sign clinked softly in the wind.

There was a side door, steel, with a push bar. It had a fresh scrape near the handle, shiny where paint had been rubbed off. I pushed.

It opened without resistance.

Inside, my phone didn’t “fade” to no service. It just flipped to SOS and then to nothing, like the building swallowed it. I told myself it was the thick concrete and all the metal. Warehouses are dead zones. I’ve lost signal in my own school stairwell.

Still, the timing made my skin prickle.

The silence hit right after, big and flat.

The first room was an office area with glass panes and dusty desks. Someone had smashed a window and the glass had been swept into a neat pile in the corner. Not scattered. Not random. A neat pile, like whoever did it didn’t want to step on it.

There was a smell in there too. Not mold. Something sharper. Warmed plastic, and a faint tang like exhaust that didn’t belong in a room that was supposed to be cold and dead.

I moved deeper, past the office, into the main floor.

The warehouse opened up like an airplane hangar. Rows of empty shelving reached into the dark. Conveyor belts ran overhead, frozen in mid-motion, their rollers dull with dust. Yellow safety lines were painted on the concrete, worn from years of forklifts.

My flashlight caught a sign on a pillar about required PPE and forklift traffic. The kind of sign you don’t even see when you’re working because it’s just there.

Then I saw fresh boot prints.

Near a side entrance where mud had dried in a streak, there were clear treads. Wide heel. Recent enough that the mud was still darker than the concrete around it.

I stopped and listened.

Nothing.

Then, far off, something clicked.

Not the random pop of a settling building. A deliberate click, like a switch.

I whispered, “Hello?” which was the dumbest thing I could have done because it told whoever was in there that I was real and I was alone.

No answer.

I kept walking anyway, slower, trying to find the obvious “people hang out here” spot. That’s what those videos always show. Spray paint cans. A mattress. Beer bottles.

I found something worse.

Near the center of the building, under one of the conveyor lines, there was a folding chair facing a blank wall. Just one chair, centered like it was placed for a reason. On the floor in front of it were three chalk marks in a little triangle, like someone had been measuring distance.

On the chair was a cheap set of ear protection, the kind you’d wear around loud machinery.

My throat tightened.

I backed up without thinking, my heel scraping concrete.

From somewhere in the dark, a sound answered my scrape. A soft shuffle. One step. Then stillness.

I killed my flashlight and froze.

Total dark.

I listened so hard my ears hurt.

Breathing. My own. Too loud.

Then I heard it again.

Another step.

Closer.

I turned my flashlight back on and swung it across the aisles, trying to catch movement.

Nothing.

But the feeling changed. The warehouse didn’t feel empty anymore. It felt occupied. Like the air had shifted around a body.

I started walking back the way I came, fast but trying not to run. Running in a warehouse is how you fall into a hole or hit your head and nobody finds you.

I passed the office again and aimed for the side door.

The door was closed.

It had been open. I knew it had. I could still picture the push bar.

Now it was shut, and the thin gap of light under it was gone.

I reached for it, pulled, and the door didn’t budge.

Locked.

My hand went numb around the handle.

I tugged harder. Nothing.

I put my shoulder into it. Metal rang. Still nothing.

That was the moment the fear got simple. Not creepy fear. Survival fear.

Someone is in here with me, and they can lock doors.

I turned, scanning the office. There was a security desk near the hallway that led deeper into the building. On the desk was a clipboard with a paper that said VISITOR LOG at the top. It looked old, but the pen beside it didn’t. The pen was clean, like it had been placed that day.

I don’t know why I did it. My hands were shaking and I wanted them to do something that wasn’t yanking on a locked door.

I wrote my first name on the log. Just “Eli,” and the time. I didn’t even think. I wrote it like a joke, like I could laugh later about signing into a dead building.

The ink looked too dark on the page, too fresh.

I regretted it immediately.

I went down the hallway instead, trying to find another exit.

At the end of the hall was a stairwell door. I pushed it open.

Cold air hit my face. The stairwell smelled like wet cement and rust. Metal stairs went up to a second level, probably a maintenance mezzanine.

I stepped inside and pulled the door shut behind me.

The latch clicked.

Then, behind it, I heard a soft tap.

Knuckle on metal.

Once.

Then again, slow.

Tap.

Tap.

Not banging. Not trying to break in. Just letting me know they were there.

I backed up a step onto the stairs.

Tap.

Tap.

The tapping stopped.

A few seconds of nothing.

Then I heard the latch move on the other side. A quiet sliding sound.

The door handle turned.

It didn’t open. But it turned, like someone was testing it.

Then, very softly, a voice said from the other side, “You lost?”

It wasn’t a monster voice. It wasn’t a whispery ghost voice. It was a normal adult voice, calm and almost bored.

That terrified me more than anything.

I didn’t answer.

The voice sighed like I was inconveniencing them.

“Wrong place to be,” it said. “Come on. Let’s get you out.”

The words sounded helpful. The tone didn’t.

I backed up another step. My shoe scraped metal.

Silence.

I started up the stairs, faster now. The metal clanged under my feet. I hated every sound I made but I couldn’t stop.

Halfway up, the stairwell lights came on.

Not full bright. A flicker, then steady industrial glow. The kind you get when power comes to a place that’s supposed to be dead.

I froze, staring up at the fixture. Dust drifted through the light like slow snow.

Below me, the stairwell door clicked open.

I did not look back. I ran up the rest of the stairs and pulled myself onto the upper landing.

The upper level was a long catwalk running along the inside wall of the warehouse. Grated metal floor. Safety rail. From up there I could see almost everything below. Shelving rows. Conveyor belts. The chair.

And now I could see the generator.

A small portable generator sat tucked behind a stack of pallets near the far wall. The little fuel cap glinted in my beam. A heavy extension cord ran from it into a junction box. Someone had taped a label on the box with a strip of white tape and black marker. It said “LIGHTS / PA.”

My stomach dropped again.

Whoever was here didn’t just sneak in. They set up power on purpose. They planned to turn the building on when they wanted.

I heard footsteps on the stairs behind me.

Slow. Patient.

Like the person wasn’t worried about catching me because they already knew where I could and couldn’t go.

I moved along the catwalk, flashlight sweeping for a way down. There was a ladder in the distance, and a second stairwell on the far side.

I chose the ladder because it was closer.

My hands shook as I ran. The grate under my shoes made a hollow clatter. The warehouse threw the sound back at me.

The footsteps behind me stayed steady.

Not sprinting.

Just following.

I reached the ladder and started down. It was bolted to the wall and dropped to the floor near a row of shelving.

I was halfway down when something hit the catwalk above me.

A heavy thud, like a boot kicked the metal.

The ladder vibrated. My hands slipped.

I climbed faster. My glove caught on a sharp edge and tore. My bare palm scraped metal and pain flared.

I dropped the last few feet instead of climbing properly. My feet hit concrete hard. I stumbled forward, catching myself by slamming my shoulder into a shelf upright.

Above me, on the catwalk, a figure leaned on the rail and watched.

I only saw them for a second in my flashlight beam. Adult. Dark jacket. A headlamp on their forehead, but it was off. Face kept in shadow.

They didn’t yell. They didn’t threaten me.

They raised one hand, slow, and pointed toward the aisle in front of me like they were directing traffic.

I ran.

I wove between shelving, trying to use the rows like cover. I kept expecting them to jump down and chase me, but the footsteps stayed above for a bit, tracking, then stopped.

I couldn’t tell if that was good or worse.

I found a side exit door near one of the loading bays. It had a panic bar and a chain looped through the handles from the inside.

Not a normal chain. A thick one, like someone brought it from home. The padlock looked new, shiny, almost proud of itself.

I yanked the door anyway. The chain held.

I turned and looked for another way out, and that’s when the lights cut out.

Not gradually. Off.

Darkness snapped back in.

My flashlight was still on, but the warehouse swallowed the beam. Everything beyond a few yards was black.

Then the PA system crackled overhead.

A speaker popped and hissed, then a voice came through, slightly distorted.

A recording at first.

“Hello?”

Pause.

Then it said, “Eli.”

My knees went watery.

The name came again, clearer.

“Eli.”

I felt my stomach turn cold, because I knew exactly how it happened. I could see the clipboard. The pen. My own handwriting.

The calm voice returned, live this time.

“I told you it’s the wrong place,” it said. “Now you’re making noise. People hear noise.”

I spun in a slow circle, trying to see where the voice came from. It could have been anywhere.

My flashlight beam caught something hanging from a shelf upright.

A strip of reflective tape. Bright orange.

Then another on the next upright. And the next.

A path.

A line of orange markers, spaced just far enough apart to pull your eyes along the aisle.

The voice on the PA said, “Follow the tape. You’ll get out.”

It sounded like a test.

It sounded like a trap.

I did not follow the tape.

I turned and ran in the opposite direction.

That decision probably saved my life and it also got me hurt.

I sprinted down an aisle, cut left, then right, trying to head back toward the office windows. I figured even if the door was locked, I could break glass and crawl out. I didn’t care about trespassing charges anymore. I cared about daylight and people.

My flashlight beam bounced. Shadows jumped. Shelf columns turned into bodies for a split second and then steel again.

Then my foot caught something low across the floor.

I didn’t see it until it hit my shin.

It wasn’t a wire. It was a strap, like a ratchet strap laid across the aisle at ankle height, pulled tight.

My legs went out from under me.

I hit the concrete hard, shoulder first, then my face. My teeth clacked together so hard I thought one cracked.

My flashlight flew and spun, painting circles across the shelves.

Before I could scramble up, something heavy landed on my backpack and pinned it.

Not a boot on my spine. Not a knee on my neck. Just enough weight to trap me in place.

I bucked and twisted, trying to get free, and that’s when my right hand slid across something sharp.

Pain ripped through my palm. Real, hot pain.

Glass.

Someone had scattered broken glass right where you’d catch yourself.

I jerked my hand back and saw blood immediately, bright in the flashlight beam.

I tried to close my fingers. They didn’t listen right away.

Above me, the calm voice spoke, not through the PA this time.

Right behind my head.

“You really should’ve followed the tape.”

I couldn’t see him. My face was pressed to the floor. The flashlight was angled wrong. I could only see his shadow stretching across the concrete.

He didn’t sound excited. He sounded mildly annoyed, like I made his night harder.

I kicked backward. My heel hit something, maybe his shin, because the weight on my backpack shifted.

That tiny shift was all I needed. I yanked my arm free of the straps, crawled out of my backpack like I was shedding it, grabbed my flashlight, and ran one-handed.

Blood ran down my wrist into my glove. My hand throbbed in time with my heartbeat.

The PA system crackled again, and the live voice said, “Now you’re bleeding in my building.”

Like I owed him an apology.

I ran toward the office area, following memory, not tape. I could taste metal in my mouth. My ankle burned from the fall, but I couldn’t slow down.

I shoved through the office and saw the glass panes.

I raised my flashlight like a hammer and swung. The glass spiderwebbed but didn’t fall.

Safety glass.

Of course it was safety glass.

Footsteps hit the office threshold behind me, closer now.

I grabbed a chair and swung it into the glass again.

Leave.

And if someone offers to “help you out” in a voice that’s too calm, do not answer.

Our destination was supposed to be an adventure, a cabin in the mountains where we could forget about exams and papers, at least for a weekend. But what we got was something else entirely.

The three of us had always been close, each of us playing a part in our peculiar little trio. There was me, Jason, the designated driver and unofficial planner. I liked to think of myself as the one who kept us grounded, the one who knew how to read a map or change a tire when things went wrong. 

The others liked to joke that I was born thirty years too late, that my knack for analog solutions and my mistrust of GPS meant I was more suited to road trips of the '80s than the tech-filled caravans of today.

Then there was Leah. Leah was the spark, the reason this trip existed in the first place. She was always the one with the ideas, the kind that started with “Wouldn’t it be crazy if…?” and ended up with us sneaking into the campus library after hours or setting out at midnight for a spontaneous drive to the coast. 

Leah had a wild spirit, the type that made you believe anything could be fun as long as she was around. She was impulsive, unpredictable, and exactly the kind of person you wanted next to you when life started feeling too routine.

And finally, there was Eric. Eric was the quiet one, thoughtful, skeptical, but always game once Leah managed to convince him. He was the kind of guy who preferred stability over chaos but found himself often choosing chaos simply because Leah and I were his friends. 

He kept a book in his backpack at all times, claiming you never knew when you might get a chance to read. Leah teased him about it endlessly, but deep down, we both knew that Eric’s bookish demeanor kept us from wandering too far into dangerous territory, at least most of the time.

The trip had started out smooth enough. The plan was simple: leave campus Friday afternoon, drive for a few hours, and reach the cabin by nightfall. We were armed with snacks, a playlist Leah had curated called “Songs for Escaping Reality,” and Eric’s stack of travel guides and trail maps.

“I swear, this playlist is going to change your life,” Leah said, grinning as she cranked up the volume. The first notes of a classic rock song blared through the speakers, and she started nodding her head to the beat.

Eric rolled his eyes, but a smile tugged at his lips. “Yeah, yeah, until you play that one weird techno track that you always sneak in.”

“Oh, come on! It’s all part of the experience,” Leah shot back, winking at me in the rearview mirror.

“As long as it keeps us awake,” I said, keeping my eyes on the road. The sky was blushing with the colors of sunset as we left behind the sprawling cityscape and ventured into the countryside. 

Everything was perfect until it wasn’t. A detour sign appeared on the road where none should have been, and our GPS lost its signal somewhere in the rolling hills.

""Uh, that's weird. Was this detour here last time?"" I asked, frowning as I slowed down.

Leah leaned forward, squinting at the sign. ""Who cares? It’s an adventure, right? Besides, what's the worst that could happen?"" She flashed a grin, her enthusiasm infectious as always.

Eric, sitting in the back, sighed. ""I don't know, guys. Detours that aren't on maps tend to end up in horror movies,"" he said, but there was a hint of a smile on his face.

""Oh, come on, Eric. Don’t be such a buzzkill,"" Leah teased. ""I promise, if we end up in a horror movie, I’ll save you first.""

""That’s reassuring,"" Eric replied, rolling his eyes.

We weren’t worried, not at first. I had maps, after all, and Leah had a sixth sense for adventure. We laughed about it, teasing each other as the sun dipped lower, the horizon melting into a deep, inky blue. The mood was light, Leah making jokes about the ""mystery road"" and Eric reluctantly joining in.

""Maybe we'll find buried treasure,"" Leah said, her voice tinged with excitement.

""Or a cult,"" Eric added, shaking his head. ""Hopefully not a cult.""

We passed fields and forests, the headlights cutting through an increasingly lonely road, the kind where you started to forget you were even part of the world anymore.

It was Leah who first pointed it out... the flickering neon sign glowing faintly in the distance. 

“The Last Stop Café,” it read, in faded letters. 

Leah was thrilled, immediately insisting we pull over. She called it a “classic roadside experience,” her enthusiasm spilling over into her voice as she spoke of milkshakes and greasy fries served in places just like this.

Eric sighed, a small reluctant smile tugging at his lips as he nodded. “Might as well. We’re lost anyway,” he muttered, glancing at me.

I hesitated.

“Come on, Jason, where’s your sense of adventure?” Leah’s voice broke through my thoughts. She leaned in, her eyes sparkling. “I bet they have the best milkshakes.”

“Yeah, the kind with extra mystery ingredients,” Eric said drily, but he was already unbuckling his seatbelt.

The gravel crunched beneath the tires as we pulled into the lot, the diner standing solitary under the night sky, its windows glowing an eerie yellow. The place seemed oddly empty. 

“Anyone else getting a weird vibe from this place?” I asked, trying to keep my tone light.

Leah laughed, already halfway out of the car. “You always think too much, Jason. It’s just a diner!”

Eric shrugged. “Let’s just grab something to eat. It’s probably fine.” He paused, looking at the darkened road behind us. “Though it is kind of… isolated.”

“But that’s what makes it an adventure!” Leah declared, stretching her arms. She turned to me with a grin. “Besides, I’m starving. Let’s go!”

I followed them toward the entrance. The door creaked open and we stepped inside. The diner was small, with red vinyl booths and a long counter lined with chrome stools. A lone waitress stood behind the counter, giving us a polite smile.

""Welcome in, folks,"" she said, her voice warm. ""Sit wherever you'd like.""

Leah immediately pointed to a booth near the window. ""That one! It’s got the best view,"" she said, practically bouncing over to it.

Eric and I followed, settling into the booth. I couldn’t help but notice how empty the diner was, just us and a few other patrons who seemed lost in their own world.

As I looked closer, I noticed the other patrons more carefully. There was a man sitting alone at the counter, staring into a cup of coffee.

In the corner booth, an elderly couple sat side by side, neither of them speaking. The woman was looking out the window, her expression blank, while the man seemed to be fixated on a spot on the table, his lips moving as if he were muttering something under his breath.

Eric followed my gaze and raised an eyebrow. ""Not exactly the liveliest bunch, huh?""

Leah shrugged. ""Hey, it’s late. People are tired. Besides, it’s kind of nice to have the place mostly to ourselves.""

The waitress approached our table. She handed us the menus without a word, her demeanor far less welcoming than before, and left without waiting for a response.

Leah opened her menu first, her eyes widening. ""Whoa, guys, check this out. There are actual rules in here. Like... rules for eating at a diner?""

""Rules?"" Eric asked, raising an eyebrow as he flipped open his menu. ""What kind of rules?""

I glanced at my own menu, noticing a laminated page right at the front titled 'House Rules'. Leah cleared her throat dramatically and began reading aloud.

""Rule 1: Do not ask the staff about the diner's history,"" she said, pausing for effect. ""Oh no, we can’t talk about the mysterious past of the creepy diner. What a shame.""

Eric snorted. ""Yeah, right. Like anyone actually cares about that.""

Leah continued, her voice dripping with playful sarcasm. ""Rule 2: Do not enter the restroom alone. Well, I guess I'm on my own if I need to go. Thanks for nothing, guys.""

I chuckled. ""Maybe they’re just really big on safety. Or maybe they just don't want anyone wandering off and getting lost in their haunted bathroom.""

""Rule 3: If the neon sign outside flickers, close your eyes until it stops,"" Leah read, her eyebrows shooting up. ""Close your eyes? Are they worried about seizures or something?""

""Rule 4: Avoid the kitchen at all costs, even if you hear someone calling for help,"" I read aloud, raising an eyebrow. ""Well, that’s oddly specific.""

Leah grinned. ""Maybe they just don't want us to steal their secret recipes.""

""Or maybe it's where they keep the bodies,"" Eric added, his tone deadpan.

""Rule 5: If someone sits in the booth across from you with a blurry face, do not speak to them,"" I read aloud, glancing at Leah and Eric. ""Blurry face? What does that even mean?""

Eric laughed. ""Maybe they just don’t want us talking to strangers.""

""Rule 6: If the power goes out, stay seated and do not speak until the lights return,"" Leah read, her smile fading slightly. ""Okay, that one’s just creepy.""

""Probably just a gimmick to make the place seem spooky,"" I said, trying to keep the mood light.

Leah nodded, then read the next one. ""Rule 7: Never turn around if someone taps you on the shoulder.""

""Rule 8: Do not answer if your name is called by someone you don’t recognize,"" Eric read, his voice taking on a mock-serious tone. ""I guess no new friends for us tonight.""

""No complaints here,"" I said, chuckling.

Eric flipped to the next rule. ""Rule 9: Do not look under the table for any reason.""

""Okay, now they’re just messing with us,"" he said, shaking his head.

I took a deep breath before reading the last rule. ""And finally, Rule 10: Under no circumstances should you leave the diner before 3:00 a.m."" 

""I guess we’re stuck here for a while,"" I said, attempting to lighten the mood but failing to hide the unease. ""Hope they really do have good milkshakes.""

Leah waved her hand dismissively, her grin still intact. ""Oh, come on, Jason. It's just a cool marketing gimmick. You know, like, come for the creepy rules, stay for the food.""

Eric nodded, though he seemed to notice my tone. ""Yeah, it’s definitely giving off haunted attraction vibes. They probably get a lot of late-night thrill-seekers in here. I just hope the food lives up to the hype.""

We turned our attention back to the menus, scanning through the classic diner options. Leah tapped her finger against the table, deciding between a burger and a milkshake. ""I think I'll go for the double cheeseburger and a chocolate shake. You can't go wrong with the classics, right?""

""I'm getting the pancakes,"" Eric said. ""Breakfast for dinner never disappoints.""

""I guess I'll go with the burger, too. And maybe some fries to share,"" I added.

The waitress approached again, her demeanor just as cold as before. She pulled out her notepad and asked, ""Ready to order?""

Leah smiled up at her. ""Yeah, I'll take the double cheeseburger with a chocolate milkshake.""

Eric nodded. ""Pancakes for me, please. And a coffee.""

""Burger and fries, and a coffee for me,"" I said.

The waitress scribbled down our orders without a word, her eyes barely meeting ours. As she turned to leave, Leah spoke up, her tone playful. ""So, about these rules... Are they just for fun, or do you actually have people trying to break them?""

The waitress paused, her back still to us. Slowly, she turned, her expression more serious than ever. ""The rules are there for a reason,"" she said, her voice cold and unwavering. ""You should follow them. Every one of them.""

Leah laughed, clearly amused. ""Wow, you're really committed to the bit. It definitely keeps the creepy vibe alive.""

Eric nodded in agreement. ""Yeah, it adds to the atmosphere. Very immersive.""

The waitress didn't respond. She simply turned and walked away, her footsteps echoing again in the empty diner. I couldn't help myself. I called after her, a smirk on my face. ""Hey, what about the history of this place? Any ghost stories we should know about?""

The waitress froze mid-step. Her body stiffened, and she turned her head slightly, just enough for me to catch a glimpse of her eyes... wide, almost terrified. 

Suddenly, the lights in the diner flickered, dimming until they cast only the faintest glow. The air grew heavy, and a cold shiver ran down my spine as I felt it... a presence, a sensation of someone breathing down my neck. 

The laughter from Leah and Eric seemed to fade, and suddenly, I realized the diner was silent, too silent. My eyes darted around, and to my growing horror, I saw that Leah and Eric were no longer there. 

The booth across from me was empty, as if they had never been there at all. My heart pounded in my ears as I slowly turned my head, feeling the intense pressure of something right behind me.

I turned fully. Inches away from my face was a figure, a blurry, pale face staring straight at me, its eyes wide and hollow. It was there for just a split second, but it was enough to send a jolt of fear through me. I gasped and jerked back instinctively, my body colliding with the table. I lost my balance, falling hard onto the floor, the sound of the crash echoing in the empty diner.

Suddenly, the lights flickered back to full brightness, and Leah and Eric's laughter filled the air again, as if nothing had happened.

""Nice one, Jason,"" Leah said, still grinning. ""Really going all in on the creepy vibe, huh?""

Eric chuckled, shaking his head. ""Bravo! I like how you're getting into character. Keeps things interesting.""

I forced a smile, but my eyes darted around the diner. Something had happened, something real. I could still feel the lingering coldness, and a sense of wrongness gnawed at me. I leaned forward, lowering my voice. ""Guys, I'm serious. There was something behind me. I felt it. The lights, everything just went... off.""

Leah rolled her eyes, still grinning. ""Oh, come on, Jason. Don't try to freak us out now. You're just adding to the atmosphere, right?""

Eric shook his head, his smile not quite fading. ""Yeah, man. I gotta admit, you're doing a good job keeping the creepy vibe alive. But seriously, relax.""

I opened my mouth to argue, but Leah nudged me playfully. ""Bravo on the acting, by the way. Really sold it. Now let's just enjoy our food when it gets here.""

I tried to shake off the feeling, but the cold dread settled deep in my chest, refusing to leave. It felt like something had changed, and I couldn't quite put it out of my mind.

A few moments later, the waitress returned, balancing a tray with our orders. She set down Leah's cheeseburger and milkshake, Eric's pancakes, and my burger and fries. The food looked surprisingly good, steam rising from the plates, and for a moment, I almost forgot the strange encounter.

""Finally! I'm starving,"" Leah said, rubbing her hands together before diving into her burger.

""Pancakes look decent,"" Eric added, pouring syrup over them. ""Not bad for a creepy diner in the middle of nowhere.""

I nodded, though my appetite had waned. I took a bite of my burger, the taste barely registering as I kept glancing around, my eyes flicking to the other patrons and the shadows in the corners of the room.

""What's up, Jason?"" Leah asked through a mouthful of fries. ""You still on edge?""

I hesitated, then spoke. ""I can't shake it, Leah. When the lights went out... I swear, there was something behind me. I saw a face. It was inches away.""

Leah and Eric exchanged uneasy glances. Leah's smile faltered for a moment. ""Jason, seriously, enough. You're really starting to freak me out now.""

Eric set his coffee down, frowning slightly. ""Yeah, man. If this is a joke, it's not funny anymore. Just... stop, okay?""

I forced a smile, trying to brush off their reaction. ""I'm not joking, guys. It felt real.""

Leah shook her head, her expression torn between amusement and discomfort. ""Okay, well, can we just drop it? Let's try to enjoy the food.""

Eric nodded, his gaze shifting to his pancakes. ""Yeah, let's just move on. This place is creepy enough without us making it worse.""

We ate quietly for a while, and surprisingly, the food was actually really good. Leah was halfway through her cheeseburger, her earlier unease replaced by her usual enthusiasm. ""I have to admit, this is one of the best burgers I've had in a long time,"" she said, her voice cheerful again.

Eric nodded, his pancakes already half gone. ""Yeah, pretty solid""

I tried to relax, taking a bite of my burger. It was juicy and flavorful, and the fries were perfectly crispy.

Leah wiped her hands on a napkin and then got up, glancing towards the back of the diner. ""Alright, I hate to say it, but I need to break one of those scary rules,"" she said with a chuckle. ""Restroom time. Guess I'm going solo.""

Eric gave her a look, half-amused, half-concerned. ""You sure about that, Leah?""

She laughed, waving him off. ""What, you think I'm going to get sucked into the haunted bathroom? I'll be fine. Just keep my milkshake safe.""

I watched as Leah made her way towards the restrooms, her confidence unwavering. But something in my gut twisted with unease, and I found myself unable to look away until she disappeared behind the restroom door.

A few moments passed, and I tried to distract myself, picking at my fries. Eric was scrolling through his phone, oblivious to my anxiety. The diner felt quiet, the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead suddenly grating.

Then, a scream pierced the air. My head snapped up, and I saw Eric's eyes widen as he turned towards the restrooms. Without thinking, I jumped up from the booth, my heart pounding as I rushed to the restroom door. I slammed it open, the door crashing against the wall.

""Leah!"" I called out, my voice echoing in the small, tiled space.

Leah was on the floor, her hands covering her face. She was trembling. I kneeled down next to her, my hands hovering just above her shoulders. ""Leah, it's okay. I'm here. What happened?""

She shook her head, her voice barely audible. ""There's... there's something in the stall. I saw it.""

I glanced towards the stall she was pointing at, my stomach churning. Carefully, I stood up and moved towards it, each step feeling heavier than the last. I reached out, hesitating for a moment before pushing the stall door open.

It swung wide, revealing nothing but an empty stall. I turned back to Leah, her eyes wide with fear as she stared at me, trying to get a glimpse inside.

""There's nothing here, Leah,"" I said gently, trying to keep my voice calm. ""It's empty.""

She shook her head again. ""No... no, I swear, Jason. There was something. It was there.""

I helped her to her feet, her hands still trembling as she clung to my arm. We walked back to the table, Leah leaning heavily against me. Eric stood up as we approached, his expression a mix of concern and confusion.

""What happened?"" he asked, his eyes darting between us.

Leah sank into the booth, her face still pale. ""There was something in the stall, Eric. It... it was crawling towards me.""

Eric frowned, shaking his head. ""Leah, come on. Jason already freaked me out earlier. If you're trying to do the same thing...""

""No!"" Leah snapped, her voice trembling. ""This isn't a joke. There's something weird going on here. It's not just a marketing scheme.""

I nodded, my eyes meeting Eric's. ""She's right. Something's off about this place. We need to take this seriously.""

Eric hesitated, the doubt still evident on his face. ""Alright, fine. But... what exactly did you see, Leah?""

Leah took a deep breath, her eyes still wide with fear. ""It had four legs, like... like an animal, but no head or body. Just legs. And it started moving towards me from the stall. I screamed, and then Jason came.""

Eric stared at her for a moment, his expression shifting from confusion to discomfort. 

He sighed, rubbing his temples. ""Okay, enough. This is getting way too weird, guys. I don't know if I believe it, but... it's really starting to freak me out. Can we just stop and try to chill for a bit? I need some air. I'm going outside."" Eric pushed himself up from the booth, grabbing his jacket. He shook his head, his expression a mix of skepticism and unease. ""I don't care about the rules or whatever is supposed to happen here. I just need a cigarette.""

""Eric, wait,"" I said, my voice urgent. ""You can't just go outside. The rules...""

""Forget the rules, Jason,"" Eric snapped, his frustration clear. ""I'm not staying in here. It's too much."" He turned and headed towards the entrance, not waiting for Leah or me to respond.

Eric reached the entrance door, pushing it open, but as he stepped halfway through, he froze... literally frozen mid-step, his body rigid between the diner and the outside. His hand still held the door, and his whole form seemed almost like a mannequin stuck in motion.

""Eric?"" Leah called out, her voice shaky. ""What are you doing?""

I stood up, my heart pounding. ""Eric, come on, man. Stop messing around."" But there was no response, he was utterly still. Leah and I exchanged a nervous glance, both of us unsure of what to do.

""Is he... okay?"" Leah whispered, her eyes wide with fear.

I shook my head, slowly stepping away from the booth. ""I... I don't know. He looks like he's stuck."" I moved closer, my eyes darting around the diner. The other patrons were no longer lost in their own worlds; instead, they were staring at Eric, their eyes unblinking, their heads fixed.

""Leah... they're all staring at him,"" I muttered. She turned her head, her breath catching in her throat as she noticed the other patrons' fixed gazes.

I moved cautiously towards Eric. Just as I was within arm's reach of Eric, his body jerked violently, as if some unseen force had pushed him back. He flew into the diner, crashing onto his back and sliding several feet across the floor.

""Eric!"" I shouted, rushing to his side. He was gasping for breath, his face pale and his eyes wide with terror. I grabbed his arm, helping him sit up. ""What happened? Are you okay?""

Eric's eyes darted around wildly before locking onto mine. His voice was shaky. ""They're there... outside. They're there!""

I glanced towards the open door, but all I could see was darkness beyond. I helped Eric to his feet, and together we made our way back to the booth, Leah's face stricken with fear as she watched us approach.

""What the hell happened?"" Leah asked, her voice trembling.

Eric collapsed into the booth, his hands shaking. He took a moment to gather his breath, then began speaking. ""I stepped outside, okay? I needed air. I moved around the side of the diner and lit a cigarette.""

Leah's eyes widened, and she interrupted. ""Eric, no, you didn't. You were just in the doorway. You were frozen there.""

We all exchanged glances, both terrified and confused. Eric shook his head, bewildered. ""No, I swear I stepped outside. I was out there. While I was having my cigarette, I started hearing something calling me from just around the diner. I went to the corner and peeked around it, but there was nothing.""

He paused, his eyes darting between us as he continued, his voice trembling. ""I looked closer and started noticing movement in the dark. It was like... a face, detached from anything, just staring at me. Then the darkness seemed to get even thicker, like it swallowed everything else.""

Eric's voice dropped to a whisper. ""I turned back towards the entrance of the diner, but it was dark there too... pitch black, like nothing was there. And then I heard it... this shushing noise, closing in on me. I can't explain it, but it was like something was surrounding me. I felt this sense of dread, like nothing I've ever felt before. Suddenly, I felt a hit to my chest, and the next thing I knew, I was on the diner's floor next to you, Jason.""

I nodded, my stomach churning with dread. Whatever was happening, it was real, and we were in the middle of it. The carefree vibe from earlier was gone, replaced by a deep, unsettling fear that none of us could shake.

We sat there in silence for a moment, each of us processing what Eric had just said. I glanced around the diner, my eyes landing on the other patrons. The elderly couple in the corner booth had turned their heads slightly, their eyes now focused directly on us, their expressions blank.

Leah shifted uncomfortably, her eyes following mine. ""Jason... do you see that?"" she whispered. ""They're... they're staring at us.""

I nodded, my pulse quickening. ""Yeah, I see it.""

Eric looked up, his face still pale. ""What is wrong with these people?"" he muttered, his voice trembling. ""It's like they're not even real.""

The waitress, who had been standing behind the counter, suddenly moved. Her head turned towards us with an unnatural jerk, her eyes locking onto ours. Leah gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. ""Did you see that?""

I nodded, my throat dry. ""Yeah. Something's really wrong here.""

Eric's eyes darted to the clock on the wall. It was just past 1 a.m. ""We can't leave until 3 a.m. We literally can't leave.""

Leah's face paled as she stared at the clock. ""That's two more hours... what are we supposed to do?""

I took a deep breath. ""We stick to the rules. No more trying to test them. We just stay here, stay calm, and get through this."" My voice sounded more confident than I felt, but it was the only plan we had.

Leah nodded, her eyes still wide with fear. ""Okay... okay. But we need to keep an eye on them. Something is seriously wrong here.""

Eric looked at the patrons again, his eyes narrowing. ""They’re watching us. All of them. And I don’t think it’s just for show.""

Whatever was happening here, we were trapped, and we needed to be careful. 

Feeling the oppressive eeriness of the situation, we all got up for a moment, as if movement might help break the tension. I started pacing around our booth, back and forth, my thoughts racing as I tried to make sense of everything. Leah and Eric stood close by, their eyes darting anxiously around the diner.

As I walked, my back turned to them, I suddenly felt a light tap on my shoulder. My first thought was that it was Eric. I spun around, but when I looked towards where they had been standing, I froze. Two strangers were standing there, their faces blurry and their eyes locked directly on me. My stomach dropped as I remembered Rule 7: Never turn around if someone taps you on the shoulder. It was too late now.

The strangers stared at me. Panic surged through me, my chest tightening as I struggled to understand what was happening. Their gaze felt invasive, as if they were looking straight through me, seeing something I couldn’t comprehend.

""Leah? Eric?"" I called out again, my voice cracking, but there was no response... just the heavy silence of the diner.

The strangers took a step closer, their movements jerky, almost puppet-like. My pulse pounded in my ears. My eyes darted around the diner, catching sight of the other patrons, all of them were now staring at me, their heads turned in unison, their eyes vacant.

I freaked out. Panic clawed at my throat, and without thinking, I turned and started running through the diner. I reached the other part of the counter, my eyes wild as I scanned the room, not knowing where to run anymore. The strangers were closing in, their steps slow but relentless, like they knew I had nowhere to go.

My back hit the corner of the diner, and I slid down until I was crouched on the floor, my arms wrapped around my knees in some sort of a fetal position. My entire body trembled with terror as the lights began to flicker once more. Each flash of light revealed the strangers inching closer, their faces still blurry.

Suddenly, cold hands wrapped around my forearms, gripping me tightly. I gasped as a sharp, searing pain shot through my skin, like their fingers were burning into me. I tried to pull away, but their grip was ironclad, lifting me slightly off the ground. My vision blurred, the room spinning as the pain became unbearable, radiating up my arms like fire.

The lights flickered again, then returned to full brightness. I still felt hands on my forearms, trying to lift me up. Leah's voice broke through the haze of fear. ""Jason! Jason, it's okay. We're here. Calm down.""

I looked up, my friends' worried faces coming into focus. But the pain in my forearms was still there, a dull throb. I glanced down and saw deep red marks, finger-shaped bruises imprinted on my skin.

""It's okay,"" Leah repeated, her voice softer now. ""You're okay. We're here."" 

I took a deep breath. ""They were... they were coming for me,"" I whispered.

Leah shook her head slightly, her expression growing more serious. ""Jason, there was no one there. It was just us. You... you looked like you were in some kind of trance. Then you suddenly started running, like you were terrified of something.""

Eric nodded, his eyes meeting mine with concern. ""We tried to stop you, but you wouldn't listen.""

Leah's grip on my shoulders tightened. ""But you're okay now. We're going to stick together, alright?""

We slowly made our way back to the booth, settling in with a shared sense of unease. Just as I started to catch my breath, a new sound broke the silence... a muffled noise coming from the kitchen.

It was faint at first, like someone crying, the sound almost getting lost in the hum of the diner lights. Then it grew louder, more distinct... someone was crying for help.

Leah tensed beside me. ""Don't listen to it,"" she whispered, her voice trembling. ""It's trying to trick us. We stick to the rules.""

Eric nodded, his eyes fixed on the kitchen door, which was barely visible from our booth. ""Yeah, we can't let it get to us. It's what it wants.""

The cries grew louder, more desperate, but we held on, refusing to move. The kitchen door remained slightly ajar, and shadows seemed to dance behind it. The voice called out again, pleading, but we all sat still, determined not to be fooled.

Suddenly, I blinked, and everything changed. The booth was empty, Leah and Eric were gone. My heart dropped as I looked around, the diner now barely lit, with only a few flickering lights casting shadows across the room. The cries for help were still coming from the kitchen, but now the voice was unmistakably Leah's.

""Jason! Please, help me!"" Leah's voice echoed, filled with fear and pain. The diner was empty, every booth vacant, the air heavy and cold. The lights flickered again, making it even harder to see.

""Leah?"" I called out, my voice cracking. There was no response, only her screams growing louder, more frantic. ""Please, Jason! I'm in here!""

I took a step towards the kitchen, my mind racing. The rules said to avoid the kitchen at all costs, even if someone called for help. But Leah's voice was so real, so desperate. Each plea tore at me, making it harder to think straight.

I approached the kitchen door, the cries now almost deafening. The door was slightly open, revealing nothing but pitch darkness beyond. My hand hovered near the door handle.

""It's a trick,"" I whispered to myself. ""It's trying to trick me."" Leah's screams continued, pleading, sobbing. My entire body was shaking, my instincts screaming at me to do something.

But I didn't go inside. I couldn't. The rules were clear, and deep down, I knew this wasn't Leah... it couldn't be. I stepped back, forcing myself to look away from the darkness of the kitchen.

""I'm not falling for it,"" I muttered. The cries suddenly stopped, leaving an eerie silence that filled the diner. 

I turned away from the kitchen and looked around the empty diner, hoping, praying to see Leah and Eric again.

Suddenly, I heard a faint shuffle coming from the far end of the diner, near the entrance. I turned to look. In the dim light, I saw a silhouette standing by the door. Relief washed over me as I recognized Leah's familiar frame.

""Leah!"" I called out, my voice echoing in the stillness. She didn't respond, but she moved towards me, her steps slow and hesitant. As she got closer, I noticed something was off. Her movements were jerky, unnatural, like she was struggling against something.

""Leah, are you okay?"" I asked, my voice trembling. She stopped a few feet away from me, her head tilted slightly as if she was listening to something I couldn't hear. 

""Jason..."" she finally spoke. ""You... you have to come with me.""

My stomach twisted with unease. ""Where's Eric?"" I asked, taking a cautious step back.

""He's... waiting,"" she said, her voice flat, devoid of emotion. She reached out her hand towards me, her fingers trembling. ""Please, Jason. You have to come.""

I shook my head, my instincts screaming that something wasn't right. ""No... Leah, we need to stay here. We need to stick to the rules.""

Her eyes locked onto mine, and for a moment, I saw something flicker in them... fear, desperation. She opened her mouth to say something, but no words came out. Instead, her expression twisted into one of panic, her eyes widening as if she was trying to warn me.

Suddenly, the lights flickered again, plunging the diner into darkness. When the lights returned, Leah was gone.

Panic surged through me. I spun around, searching the empty diner. ""Leah? Eric?"" I called out. There was no response.

I felt a presence... something watching me. My eyes were drawn back to the kitchen door, still slightly ajar, the darkness beyond it seeming even deeper now. 

Suddenly, I heard a different sound... footsteps, coming from behind me. I turned slowly, my entire body tense, and saw a figure emerging from the shadows. It was Eric. He looked disheveled, his face pale, his eyes wide with fear.

""Jason,"" he whispered. ""We need to get out of here. Now.""

I hesitated, the confusion and fear swirling inside me. ""But... the rules. We can't leave until 3 a.m.""

Eric shook his head, his eyes darting around the diner. ""The rules don't matter anymore. It's changing them. It's trying to keep us here."" He grabbed my arm, his grip tight, almost painful. ""We have to go. Before it’s too late.""

The lights flickered again, and for a brief moment, I saw shadows moving across the walls, shifting and writhing as if they were alive. The diner felt like it was closing in on us, the air growing colder, the shadows creeping closer.

Eric pulled me towards the entrance, his voice urgent. ""Come on, Jason. We have to leave. Now.""

I glanced back at the kitchen door, the darkness beyond it seeming to pulse. 

Suddenly, everything shifted. In an instant, I was back at the booth. Leah and Eric were sitting across from me, and Leah was waving her hand in front of my face, trying to catch my attention.

""Jason, you drifted off for a few minutes. Are you okay?"" Eric asked, his voice filled with concern.

I blinked, disoriented, my heart still pounding in my chest. ""I... I don't know. It felt so real,"" I said, my voice shaky. ""I was alone in the diner, and there was Leah... calling from the kitchen. It was like I was caught in some sort of illusion."" I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. ""This is crazy.""

Leah exchanged a worried glance with Eric. ""Jason, you were just sitting here, staring at the kitchen door.""

Eric nodded, his eyes wide. ""We tried to snap you out of it, but you were just... gone.""

I rubbed my temples, trying to make sense of it all. The fear still clung to me, the memory of the empty diner and Leah's desperate cries vivid in my mind. ""I don't know what's real anymore,"" I muttered. ""We need to be careful. Whatever this place is, it's messing with our heads.""

Leah reached across the table, taking my hand. ""We're in this together, Jason. We just have to stay focused and remember the rules. We can't let it break us.""

Eric nodded in agreement, his expression grim. ""It's trying to divide us, make us lose our grip. We just have to hold on a little longer. It's almost 3 a.m.

As the minutes dragged on, our anxiety grew. The clock on the wall ticked closer to 3 a.m., each second feeling like an eternity. Leah and Eric exchanged nervous glances, and I could feel the tension between us, the weight of the unknown pressing down on us.

Finally, the clock struck 3 a.m., the sound echoing through the empty diner. We all exhaled, a mixture of fear and relief washing over us. Leah nodded towards the front door. ""It's time. Let's get out of here.""

We stood up together, making our way towards the entrance. I pulled the door open, expecting to see the dark road outside, our way out of this nightmare. Instead, all we saw was darkness... a void, empty and endless.

""What... what is this?"" Eric muttered. The doorway led to nothing, just an infinite darkness that seemed to swallow the light from the diner.

Suddenly, a noise behind us... the strange patrons in the booths, the other patrons who had been eerily silent all night, began to move. They stood up, one by one, their movements slow, their eyes fixed on us.

Leah took a step back, her breath catching in her throat. ""They're coming...""

The patrons approached us, their faces expressionless, their footsteps echoing in the stillness of the diner. I felt a surge of panic, my instincts screaming at me to run, but there was nowhere to go... the door led to nothing, and the patrons were closing in.

But then, the patrons stopped. In unison, they spoke, their voices overlapping in a haunting harmony. ""The only way to escape is to follow us.""

Leah, Eric, and I exchanged wary glances, uncertainty etched across our faces. The patrons began to move again, gesturing for us to follow them towards the back of the diner. Hesitant but desperate, we had no choice. We followed them...

They led us to a part of the diner we hadn't noticed before... a door at the back, hidden in the shadows, one that hadn't been there earlier. The patrons gestured towards it.

""Through here,"" they said in unison. ""It's the only way.""

Together, we pushed open the door, a cold breeze hitting us as it swung open. We stepped through, and suddenly, we were outside. The cold night air was like a wave of relief, the oppressive feeling from the diner finally lifting.

We turned around, but the door and the diner... were gone. All that remained was an empty road, stretching out into the darkness.

Leah let out a shaky breath, her eyes wide with disbelief. ""We made it... we're out.""

Eric nodded, his face a mix of exhaustion and relief. ""I don't know how, but we did it.""

I looked around, the memory of the diner's horrors still vivid in my mind. We were free, but I knew that night would haunt us forever.

""Come on,"" I said. ""Let's get as far away from here as we can.""

Weeks after escaping, I sat in my dorm, browsing online forums late at night. I came across a post titled ""The Vanishing Diner - Have You Seen It?"". I read accounts eerily similar to our own. The Last Stop Café... people claimed it had been appearing and disappearing across different states for decades. The descriptions were identical: detours that shouldn't exist, strange rules in the menus, and patrons with blurry faces.

As I read further, I stumbled upon posts from people searching desperately for loved ones who vanished after visiting diners just like this one. The eerie part? The missing individuals matched the descriptions of people we saw that night. A chill ran through me as I realized we might have been witnessing people who were already lost to the diner, trapped in some twisted limbo.

The realization left me cold, we might have become just another entry in those threads.

So, if you ever find yourself on a detour and see The Last Stop Café, just keep driving.",2,1767043215.0,CreepyStoriesArchive,0,1.0,False

1pyyibi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pyyibi/we_took_a_detour_and_found_a_diner_that_shouldnt/,We Took a Detour and Found a Diner That Shouldn’t Exist,"We called it the trip of the year, a chance to break free from the suffocating grind of college life, an impulsive decision born over too many late-night study sessions and caffeine highs. Our destination was supposed to be an adventure, a cabin in the mountains where we could forget about exams and papers, at least for a weekend. But what we got was something else entirely.

The three of us had always been close, each of us playing a part in our peculiar little trio. There was me, Jason, the designated driver and unofficial planner. I liked to think of myself as the one who kept us grounded, the one who knew how to read a map or change a tire when things went wrong. 

The others liked to joke that I was born thirty years too late, that my knack for analog solutions and my mistrust of GPS meant I was more suited to road trips of the '80s than the tech-filled caravans of today.

Then there was Leah. Leah was the spark, the reason this trip existed in the first place. She was always the one with the ideas, the kind that started with “Wouldn’t it be crazy if…?” and ended up with us sneaking into the campus library after hours or setting out at midnight for a spontaneous drive to the coast. 

Leah had a wild spirit, the type that made you believe anything could be fun as long as she was around. She was impulsive, unpredictable, and exactly the kind of person you wanted next to you when life started feeling too routine.

And finally, there was Eric. Eric was the quiet one, thoughtful, skeptical, but always game once Leah managed to convince him. He was the kind of guy who preferred stability over chaos but found himself often choosing chaos simply because Leah and I were his friends. 

He kept a book in his backpack at all times, claiming you never knew when you might get a chance to read. Leah teased him about it endlessly, but deep down, we both knew that Eric’s bookish demeanor kept us from wandering too far into dangerous territory, at least most of the time.

The trip had started out smooth enough. The plan was simple: leave campus Friday afternoon, drive for a few hours, and reach the cabin by nightfall. We were armed with snacks, a playlist Leah had curated called “Songs for Escaping Reality,” and Eric’s stack of travel guides and trail maps.

“I swear, this playlist is going to change your life,” Leah said, grinning as she cranked up the volume. The first notes of a classic rock song blared through the speakers, and she started nodding her head to the beat.

Eric rolled his eyes, but a smile tugged at his lips. “Yeah, yeah, until you play that one weird techno track that you always sneak in.”

“Oh, come on! It’s all part of the experience,” Leah shot back, winking at me in the rearview mirror.

“As long as it keeps us awake,” I said, keeping my eyes on the road. The sky was blushing with the colors of sunset as we left behind the sprawling cityscape and ventured into the countryside. 

Everything was perfect until it wasn’t. A detour sign appeared on the road where none should have been, and our GPS lost its signal somewhere in the rolling hills.

""Uh, that's weird. Was this detour here last time?"" I asked, frowning as I slowed down.

Leah leaned forward, squinting at the sign. ""Who cares? It’s an adventure, right? Besides, what's the worst that could happen?"" She flashed a grin, her enthusiasm infectious as always.

Eric, sitting in the back, sighed. ""I don't know, guys. Detours that aren't on maps tend to end up in horror movies,"" he said, but there was a hint of a smile on his face.

""Oh, come on, Eric. Don’t be such a buzzkill,"" Leah teased. ""I promise, if we end up in a horror movie, I’ll save you first.""

""That’s reassuring,"" Eric replied, rolling his eyes.

We weren’t worried, not at first. I had maps, after all, and Leah had a sixth sense for adventure. We laughed about it, teasing each other as the sun dipped lower, the horizon melting into a deep, inky blue. The mood was light, Leah making jokes about the ""mystery road"" and Eric reluctantly joining in.

""Maybe we'll find buried treasure,"" Leah said, her voice tinged with excitement.

""Or a cult,"" Eric added, shaking his head. ""Hopefully not a cult.""

We passed fields and forests, the headlights cutting through an increasingly lonely road, the kind where you started to forget you were even part of the world anymore.

It was Leah who first pointed it out... the flickering neon sign glowing faintly in the distance. 

“The Last Stop Café,” it read, in faded letters. 

Leah was thrilled, immediately insisting we pull over. She called it a “classic roadside experience,” her enthusiasm spilling over into her voice as she spoke of milkshakes and greasy fries served in places just like this.

Eric sighed, a small reluctant smile tugging at his lips as he nodded. “Might as well. We’re lost anyway,” he muttered, glancing at me.

I hesitated.

“Come on, Jason, where’s your sense of adventure?” Leah’s voice broke through my thoughts. She leaned in, her eyes sparkling. “I bet they have the best milkshakes.”

“Yeah, the kind with extra mystery ingredients,” Eric said drily, but he was already unbuckling his seatbelt.

The gravel crunched beneath the tires as we pulled into the lot, the diner standing solitary under the night sky, its windows glowing an eerie yellow. The place seemed oddly empty. 

“Anyone else getting a weird vibe from this place?” I asked, trying to keep my tone light.

Leah laughed, already halfway out of the car. “You always think too much, Jason. It’s just a diner!”

Eric shrugged. “Let’s just grab something to eat. It’s probably fine.” He paused, looking at the darkened road behind us. “Though it is kind of… isolated.”

“But that’s what makes it an adventure!” Leah declared, stretching her arms. She turned to me with a grin. “Besides, I’m starving. Let’s go!”

I followed them toward the entrance. The door creaked open and we stepped inside. The diner was small, with red vinyl booths and a long counter lined with chrome stools. A lone waitress stood behind the counter, giving us a polite smile.

""Welcome in, folks,"" she said, her voice warm. ""Sit wherever you'd like.""

Leah immediately pointed to a booth near the window. ""That one! It’s got the best view,"" she said, practically bouncing over to it.

Eric and I followed, settling into the booth. I couldn’t help but notice how empty the diner was, just us and a few other patrons who seemed lost in their own world.

As I looked closer, I noticed the other patrons more carefully. There was a man sitting alone at the counter, staring into a cup of coffee.

In the corner booth, an elderly couple sat side by side, neither of them speaking. The woman was looking out the window, her expression blank, while the man seemed to be fixated on a spot on the table, his lips moving as if he were muttering something under his breath.

Eric followed my gaze and raised an eyebrow. ""Not exactly the liveliest bunch, huh?""

Leah shrugged. ""Hey, it’s late. People are tired. Besides, it’s kind of nice to have the place mostly to ourselves.""

The waitress approached our table. She handed us the menus without a word, her demeanor far less welcoming than before, and left without waiting for a response.

Leah opened her menu first, her eyes widening. ""Whoa, guys, check this out. There are actual rules in here. Like... rules for eating at a diner?""

""Rules?"" Eric asked, raising an eyebrow as he flipped open his menu. ""What kind of rules?""

I glanced at my own menu, noticing a laminated page right at the front titled 'House Rules'. Leah cleared her throat dramatically and began reading aloud.

""Rule 1: Do not ask the staff about the diner's history,"" she said, pausing for effect. ""Oh no, we can’t talk about the mysterious past of the creepy diner. What a shame.""

Eric snorted. ""Yeah, right. Like anyone actually cares about that.""

Leah continued, her voice dripping with playful sarcasm. ""Rule 2: Do not enter the restroom alone. Well, I guess I'm on my own if I need to go. Thanks for nothing, guys.""

I chuckled. ""Maybe they’re just really big on safety. Or maybe they just don't want anyone wandering off and getting lost in their haunted bathroom.""

""Rule 3: If the neon sign outside flickers, close your eyes until it stops,"" Leah read, her eyebrows shooting up. ""Close your eyes? Are they worried about seizures or something?""

""Rule 4: Avoid the kitchen at all costs, even if you hear someone calling for help,"" I read aloud, raising an eyebrow. ""Well, that’s oddly specific.""

Leah grinned. ""Maybe they just don't want us to steal their secret recipes.""

""Or maybe it's where they keep the bodies,"" Eric added, his tone deadpan.

""Rule 5: If someone sits in the booth across from you with a blurry face, do not speak to them,"" I read aloud, glancing at Leah and Eric. ""Blurry face? What does that even mean?""

Eric laughed. ""Maybe they just don’t want us talking to strangers.""

""Rule 6: If the power goes out, stay seated and do not speak until the lights return,"" Leah read, her smile fading slightly. ""Okay, that one’s just creepy.""

""Probably just a gimmick to make the place seem spooky,"" I said, trying to keep the mood light.

Leah nodded, then read the next one. ""Rule 7: Never turn around if someone taps you on the shoulder.""

""Rule 8: Do not answer if your name is called by someone you don’t recognize,"" Eric read, his voice taking on a mock-serious tone. ""I guess no new friends for us tonight.""

""No complaints here,"" I said, chuckling.

Eric flipped to the next rule. ""Rule 9: Do not look under the table for any reason.""

""Okay, now they’re just messing with us,"" he said, shaking his head.

I took a deep breath before reading the last rule. ""And finally, Rule 10: Under no circumstances should you leave the diner before 3:00 a.m."" 

""I guess we’re stuck here for a while,"" I said, attempting to lighten the mood but failing to hide the unease. ""Hope they really do have good milkshakes.""

Leah waved her hand dismissively, her grin still intact. ""Oh, come on, Jason. It's just a cool marketing gimmick. You know, like, come for the creepy rules, stay for the food.""

Eric nodded, though he seemed to notice my tone. ""Yeah, it’s definitely giving off haunted attraction vibes. They probably get a lot of late-night thrill-seekers in here. I just hope the food lives up to the hype.""

We turned our attention back to the menus, scanning through the classic diner options. Leah tapped her finger against the table, deciding between a burger and a milkshake. ""I think I'll go for the double cheeseburger and a chocolate shake. You can't go wrong with the classics, right?""

""I'm getting the pancakes,"" Eric said. ""Breakfast for dinner never disappoints.""

""I guess I'll go with the burger, too. And maybe some fries to share,"" I added.

The waitress approached again, her demeanor just as cold as before. She pulled out her notepad and asked, ""Ready to order?""

Leah smiled up at her. ""Yeah, I'll take the double cheeseburger with a chocolate milkshake.""

Eric nodded. ""Pancakes for me, please. And a coffee.""

""Burger and fries, and a coffee for me,"" I said.

The waitress scribbled down our orders without a word, her eyes barely meeting ours. As she turned to leave, Leah spoke up, her tone playful. ""So, about these rules... Are they just for fun, or do you actually have people trying to break them?""

The waitress paused, her back still to us. Slowly, she turned, her expression more serious than ever. ""The rules are there for a reason,"" she said, her voice cold and unwavering. ""You should follow them. Every one of them.""

Leah laughed, clearly amused. ""Wow, you're really committed to the bit. It definitely keeps the creepy vibe alive.""

Eric nodded in agreement. ""Yeah, it adds to the atmosphere. Very immersive.""

The waitress didn't respond. She simply turned and walked away, her footsteps echoing again in the empty diner. I couldn't help myself. I called after her, a smirk on my face. ""Hey, what about the history of this place? Any ghost stories we should know about?""

The waitress froze mid-step. Her body stiffened, and she turned her head slightly, just enough for me to catch a glimpse of her eyes... wide, almost terrified. 

Suddenly, the lights in the diner flickered, dimming until they cast only the faintest glow. The air grew heavy, and a cold shiver ran down my spine as I felt it... a presence, a sensation of someone breathing down my neck. 

The laughter from Leah and Eric seemed to fade, and suddenly, I realized the diner was silent, too silent. My eyes darted around, and to my growing horror, I saw that Leah and Eric were no longer there. 

The booth across from me was empty, as if they had never been there at all. My heart pounded in my ears as I slowly turned my head, feeling the intense pressure of something right behind me.

I turned fully. Inches away from my face was a figure, a blurry, pale face staring straight at me, its eyes wide and hollow. It was there for just a split second, but it was enough to send a jolt of fear through me. I gasped and jerked back instinctively, my body colliding with the table. I lost my balance, falling hard onto the floor, the sound of the crash echoing in the empty diner.

Suddenly, the lights flickered back to full brightness, and Leah and Eric's laughter filled the air again, as if nothing had happened.

""Nice one, Jason,"" Leah said, still grinning. ""Really going all in on the creepy vibe, huh?""

Eric chuckled, shaking his head. ""Bravo! I like how you're getting into character. Keeps things interesting.""

I forced a smile, but my eyes darted around the diner. Something had happened, something real. I could still feel the lingering coldness, and a sense of wrongness gnawed at me. I leaned forward, lowering my voice. ""Guys, I'm serious. There was something behind me. I felt it. The lights, everything just went... off.""

Leah rolled her eyes, still grinning. ""Oh, come on, Jason. Don't try to freak us out now. You're just adding to the atmosphere, right?""

Eric shook his head, his smile not quite fading. ""Yeah, man. I gotta admit, you're doing a good job keeping the creepy vibe alive. But seriously, relax.""

I opened my mouth to argue, but Leah nudged me playfully. ""Bravo on the acting, by the way. Really sold it. Now let's just enjoy our food when it gets here.""

I tried to shake off the feeling, but the cold dread settled deep in my chest, refusing to leave. It felt like something had changed, and I couldn't quite put it out of my mind.

A few moments later, the waitress returned, balancing a tray with our orders. She set down Leah's cheeseburger and milkshake, Eric's pancakes, and my burger and fries. The food looked surprisingly good, steam rising from the plates, and for a moment, I almost forgot the strange encounter.

""Finally! I'm starving,"" Leah said, rubbing her hands together before diving into her burger.

""Pancakes look decent,"" Eric added, pouring syrup over them. ""Not bad for a creepy diner in the middle of nowhere.""

I nodded, though my appetite had waned. I took a bite of my burger, the taste barely registering as I kept glancing around, my eyes flicking to the other patrons and the shadows in the corners of the room.

""What's up, Jason?"" Leah asked through a mouthful of fries. ""You still on edge?""

I hesitated, then spoke. ""I can't shake it, Leah. When the lights went out... I swear, there was something behind me. I saw a face. It was inches away.""

Leah and Eric exchanged uneasy glances. Leah's smile faltered for a moment. ""Jason, seriously, enough. You're really starting to freak me out now.""

Eric set his coffee down, frowning slightly. ""Yeah, man. If this is a joke, it's not funny anymore. Just... stop, okay?""

I forced a smile, trying to brush off their reaction. ""I'm not joking, guys. It felt real.""

Leah shook her head, her expression torn between amusement and discomfort. ""Okay, well, can we just drop it? Let's try to enjoy the food.""

Eric nodded, his gaze shifting to his pancakes. ""Yeah, let's just move on. This place is creepy enough without us making it worse.""

We ate quietly for a while, and surprisingly, the food was actually really good. Leah was halfway through her cheeseburger, her earlier unease replaced by her usual enthusiasm. ""I have to admit, this is one of the best burgers I've had in a long time,"" she said, her voice cheerful again.

Eric nodded, his pancakes already half gone. ""Yeah, pretty solid""

I tried to relax, taking a bite of my burger. It was juicy and flavorful, and the fries were perfectly crispy.

Leah wiped her hands on a napkin and then got up, glancing towards the back of the diner. ""Alright, I hate to say it, but I need to break one of those scary rules,"" she said with a chuckle. ""Restroom time. Guess I'm going solo.""

Eric gave her a look, half-amused, half-concerned. ""You sure about that, Leah?""

She laughed, waving him off. ""What, you think I'm going to get sucked into the haunted bathroom? I'll be fine. Just keep my milkshake safe.""

I watched as Leah made her way towards the restrooms, her confidence unwavering. But something in my gut twisted with unease, and I found myself unable to look away until she disappeared behind the restroom door.

A few moments passed, and I tried to distract myself, picking at my fries. Eric was scrolling through his phone, oblivious to my anxiety. The diner felt quiet, the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead suddenly grating.

Then, a scream pierced the air. My head snapped up, and I saw Eric's eyes widen as he turned towards the restrooms. Without thinking, I jumped up from the booth, my heart pounding as I rushed to the restroom door. I slammed it open, the door crashing against the wall.

""Leah!"" I called out, my voice echoing in the small, tiled space.

Leah was on the floor, her hands covering her face. She was trembling. I kneeled down next to her, my hands hovering just above her shoulders. ""Leah, it's okay. I'm here. What happened?""

She shook her head, her voice barely audible. ""There's... there's something in the stall. I saw it.""

I glanced towards the stall she was pointing at, my stomach churning. Carefully, I stood up and moved towards it, each step feeling heavier than the last. I reached out, hesitating for a moment before pushing the stall door open.

It swung wide, revealing nothing but an empty stall. I turned back to Leah, her eyes wide with fear as she stared at me, trying to get a glimpse inside.

""There's nothing here, Leah,"" I said gently, trying to keep my voice calm. ""It's empty.""

She shook her head again. ""No... no, I swear, Jason. There was something. It was there.""

I helped her to her feet, her hands still trembling as she clung to my arm. We walked back to the table, Leah leaning heavily against me. Eric stood up as we approached, his expression a mix of concern and confusion.

""What happened?"" he asked, his eyes darting between us.

Leah sank into the booth, her face still pale. ""There was something in the stall, Eric. It... it was crawling towards me.""

Eric frowned, shaking his head. ""Leah, come on. Jason already freaked me out earlier. If you're trying to do the same thing...""

""No!"" Leah snapped, her voice trembling. ""This isn't a joke. There's something weird going on here. It's not just a marketing scheme.""

I nodded, my eyes meeting Eric's. ""She's right. Something's off about this place. We need to take this seriously.""

Eric hesitated, the doubt still evident on his face. ""Alright, fine. But... what exactly did you see, Leah?""

Leah took a deep breath, her eyes still wide with fear. ""It had four legs, like... like an animal, but no head or body. Just legs. And it started moving towards me from the stall. I screamed, and then Jason came.""

Eric stared at her for a moment, his expression shifting from confusion to discomfort. 

He sighed, rubbing his temples. ""Okay, enough. This is getting way too weird, guys. I don't know if I believe it, but... it's really starting to freak me out. Can we just stop and try to chill for a bit? I need some air. I'm going outside."" Eric pushed himself up from the booth, grabbing his jacket. He shook his head, his expression a mix of skepticism and unease. ""I don't care about the rules or whatever is supposed to happen here. I just need a cigarette.""

""Eric, wait,"" I said, my voice urgent. ""You can't just go outside. The rules...""

""Forget the rules, Jason,"" Eric snapped, his frustration clear. ""I'm not staying in here. It's too much."" He turned and headed towards the entrance, not waiting for Leah or me to respond.

Eric reached the entrance door, pushing it open, but as he stepped halfway through, he froze... literally frozen mid-step, his body rigid between the diner and the outside. His hand still held the door, and his whole form seemed almost like a mannequin stuck in motion.

""Eric?"" Leah called out, her voice shaky. ""What are you doing?""

I stood up, my heart pounding. ""Eric, come on, man. Stop messing around."" But there was no response, he was utterly still. Leah and I exchanged a nervous glance, both of us unsure of what to do.

""Is he... okay?"" Leah whispered, her eyes wide with fear.

I shook my head, slowly stepping away from the booth. ""I... I don't know. He looks like he's stuck."" I moved closer, my eyes darting around the diner. The other patrons were no longer lost in their own worlds; instead, they were staring at Eric, their eyes unblinking, their heads fixed.

""Leah... they're all staring at him,"" I muttered. She turned her head, her breath catching in her throat as she noticed the other patrons' fixed gazes.

I moved cautiously towards Eric. Just as I was within arm's reach of Eric, his body jerked violently, as if some unseen force had pushed him back. He flew into the diner, crashing onto his back and sliding several feet across the floor.

""Eric!"" I shouted, rushing to his side. He was gasping for breath, his face pale and his eyes wide with terror. I grabbed his arm, helping him sit up. ""What happened? Are you okay?""

Eric's eyes darted around wildly before locking onto mine. His voice was shaky. ""They're there... outside. They're there!""

I glanced towards the open door, but all I could see was darkness beyond. I helped Eric to his feet, and together we made our way back to the booth, Leah's face stricken with fear as she watched us approach.

""What the hell happened?"" Leah asked, her voice trembling.

Eric collapsed into the booth, his hands shaking. He took a moment to gather his breath, then began speaking. ""I stepped outside, okay? I needed air. I moved around the side of the diner and lit a cigarette.""

Leah's eyes widened, and she interrupted. ""Eric, no, you didn't. You were just in the doorway. You were frozen there.""

We all exchanged glances, both terrified and confused. Eric shook his head, bewildered. ""No, I swear I stepped outside. I was out there. While I was having my cigarette, I started hearing something calling me from just around the diner. I went to the corner and peeked around it, but there was nothing.""

He paused, his eyes darting between us as he continued, his voice trembling. ""I looked closer and started noticing movement in the dark. It was like... a face, detached from anything, just staring at me. Then the darkness seemed to get even thicker, like it swallowed everything else.""

Eric's voice dropped to a whisper. ""I turned back towards the entrance of the diner, but it was dark there too... pitch black, like nothing was there. And then I heard it... this shushing noise, closing in on me. I can't explain it, but it was like something was surrounding me. I felt this sense of dread, like nothing I've ever felt before. Suddenly, I felt a hit to my chest, and the next thing I knew, I was on the diner's floor next to you, Jason.""

I nodded, my stomach churning with dread. Whatever was happening, it was real, and we were in the middle of it. The carefree vibe from earlier was gone, replaced by a deep, unsettling fear that none of us could shake.

We sat there in silence for a moment, each of us processing what Eric had just said. I glanced around the diner, my eyes landing on the other patrons. The elderly couple in the corner booth had turned their heads slightly, their eyes now focused directly on us, their expressions blank.

Leah shifted uncomfortably, her eyes following mine. ""Jason... do you see that?"" she whispered. ""They're... they're staring at us.""

I nodded, my pulse quickening. ""Yeah, I see it.""

Eric looked up, his face still pale. ""What is wrong with these people?"" he muttered, his voice trembling. ""It's like they're not even real.""

The waitress, who had been standing behind the counter, suddenly moved. Her head turned towards us with an unnatural jerk, her eyes locking onto ours. Leah gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. ""Did you see that?""

I nodded, my throat dry. ""Yeah. Something's really wrong here.""

Eric's eyes darted to the clock on the wall. It was just past 1 a.m. ""We can't leave until 3 a.m. We literally can't leave.""

Leah's face paled as she stared at the clock. ""That's two more hours... what are we supposed to do?""

I took a deep breath. ""We stick to the rules. No more trying to test them. We just stay here, stay calm, and get through this."" My voice sounded more confident than I felt, but it was the only plan we had.

Leah nodded, her eyes still wide with fear. ""Okay... okay. But we need to keep an eye on them. Something is seriously wrong here.""

Eric looked at the patrons again, his eyes narrowing. ""They’re watching us. All of them. And I don’t think it’s just for show.""

Whatever was happening here, we were trapped, and we needed to be careful. 

Feeling the oppressive eeriness of the situation, we all got up for a moment, as if movement might help break the tension. I started pacing around our booth, back and forth, my thoughts racing as I tried to make sense of everything. Leah and Eric stood close by, their eyes darting anxiously around the diner.

As I walked, my back turned to them, I suddenly felt a light tap on my shoulder. My first thought was that it was Eric. I spun around, but when I looked towards where they had been standing, I froze. Two strangers were standing there, their faces blurry and their eyes locked directly on me. My stomach dropped as I remembered Rule 7: Never turn around if someone taps you on the shoulder. It was too late now.

The strangers stared at me. Panic surged through me, my chest tightening as I struggled to understand what was happening. Their gaze felt invasive, as if they were looking straight through me, seeing something I couldn’t comprehend.

""Leah? Eric?"" I called out again, my voice cracking, but there was no response... just the heavy silence of the diner.

The strangers took a step closer, their movements jerky, almost puppet-like. My pulse pounded in my ears. My eyes darted around the diner, catching sight of the other patrons, all of them were now staring at me, their heads turned in unison, their eyes vacant.

I freaked out. Panic clawed at my throat, and without thinking, I turned and started running through the diner. I reached the other part of the counter, my eyes wild as I scanned the room, not knowing where to run anymore. The strangers were closing in, their steps slow but relentless, like they knew I had nowhere to go.

My back hit the corner of the diner, and I slid down until I was crouched on the floor, my arms wrapped around my knees in some sort of a fetal position. My entire body trembled with terror as the lights began to flicker once more. Each flash of light revealed the strangers inching closer, their faces still blurry.

Suddenly, cold hands wrapped around my forearms, gripping me tightly. I gasped as a sharp, searing pain shot through my skin, like their fingers were burning into me. I tried to pull away, but their grip was ironclad, lifting me slightly off the ground. My vision blurred, the room spinning as the pain became unbearable, radiating up my arms like fire.

The lights flickered again, then returned to full brightness. I still felt hands on my forearms, trying to lift me up. Leah's voice broke through the haze of fear. ""Jason! Jason, it's okay. We're here. Calm down.""

I looked up, my friends' worried faces coming into focus. But the pain in my forearms was still there, a dull throb. I glanced down and saw deep red marks, finger-shaped bruises imprinted on my skin.

""It's okay,"" Leah repeated, her voice softer now. ""You're okay. We're here."" 

I took a deep breath. ""They were... they were coming for me,"" I whispered.

Leah shook her head slightly, her expression growing more serious. ""Jason, there was no one there. It was just us. You... you looked like you were in some kind of trance. Then you suddenly started running, like you were terrified of something.""

Eric nodded, his eyes meeting mine with concern. ""We tried to stop you, but you wouldn't listen.""

Leah's grip on my shoulders tightened. ""But you're okay now. We're going to stick together, alright?""

We slowly made our way back to the booth, settling in with a shared sense of unease. Just as I started to catch my breath, a new sound broke the silence... a muffled noise coming from the kitchen.

It was faint at first, like someone crying, the sound almost getting lost in the hum of the diner lights. Then it grew louder, more distinct... someone was crying for help.

Leah tensed beside me. ""Don't listen to it,"" she whispered, her voice trembling. ""It's trying to trick us. We stick to the rules.""

Eric nodded, his eyes fixed on the kitchen door, which was barely visible from our booth. ""Yeah, we can't let it get to us. It's what it wants.""

The cries grew louder, more desperate, but we held on, refusing to move. The kitchen door remained slightly ajar, and shadows seemed to dance behind it. The voice called out again, pleading, but we all sat still, determined not to be fooled.

Suddenly, I blinked, and everything changed. The booth was empty, Leah and Eric were gone. My heart dropped as I looked around, the diner now barely lit, with only a few flickering lights casting shadows across the room. The cries for help were still coming from the kitchen, but now the voice was unmistakably Leah's.

""Jason! Please, help me!"" Leah's voice echoed, filled with fear and pain. The diner was empty, every booth vacant, the air heavy and cold. The lights flickered again, making it even harder to see.

""Leah?"" I called out, my voice cracking. There was no response, only her screams growing louder, more frantic. ""Please, Jason! I'm in here!""

I took a step towards the kitchen, my mind racing. The rules said to avoid the kitchen at all costs, even if someone called for help. But Leah's voice was so real, so desperate. Each plea tore at me, making it harder to think straight.

I approached the kitchen door, the cries now almost deafening. The door was slightly open, revealing nothing but pitch darkness beyond. My hand hovered near the door handle.

""It's a trick,"" I whispered to myself. ""It's trying to trick me."" Leah's screams continued, pleading, sobbing. My entire body was shaking, my instincts screaming at me to do something.

But I didn't go inside. I couldn't. The rules were clear, and deep down, I knew this wasn't Leah... it couldn't be. I stepped back, forcing myself to look away from the darkness of the kitchen.

""I'm not falling for it,"" I muttered. The cries suddenly stopped, leaving an eerie silence that filled the diner. 

I turned away from the kitchen and looked around the empty diner, hoping, praying to see Leah and Eric again.

Suddenly, I heard a faint shuffle coming from the far end of the diner, near the entrance. I turned to look. In the dim light, I saw a silhouette standing by the door. Relief washed over me as I recognized Leah's familiar frame.

""Leah!"" I called out, my voice echoing in the stillness. She didn't respond, but she moved towards me, her steps slow and hesitant. As she got closer, I noticed something was off. Her movements were jerky, unnatural, like she was struggling against something.

""Leah, are you okay?"" I asked, my voice trembling. She stopped a few feet away from me, her head tilted slightly as if she was listening to something I couldn't hear. 

""Jason..."" she finally spoke. ""You... you have to come with me.""

My stomach twisted with unease. ""Where's Eric?"" I asked, taking a cautious step back.

""He's... waiting,"" she said, her voice flat, devoid of emotion. She reached out her hand towards me, her fingers trembling. ""Please, Jason. You have to come.""

I shook my head, my instincts screaming that something wasn't right. ""No... Leah, we need to stay here. We need to stick to the rules.""

Her eyes locked onto mine, and for a moment, I saw something flicker in them... fear, desperation. She opened her mouth to say something, but no words came out. Instead, her expression twisted into one of panic, her eyes widening as if she was trying to warn me.

Suddenly, the lights flickered again, plunging the diner into darkness. When the lights returned, Leah was gone.

Panic surged through me. I spun around, searching the empty diner. ""Leah? Eric?"" I called out. There was no response.

I felt a presence... something watching me. My eyes were drawn back to the kitchen door, still slightly ajar, the darkness beyond it seeming even deeper now. 

Suddenly, I heard a different sound... footsteps, coming from behind me. I turned slowly, my entire body tense, and saw a figure emerging from the shadows. It was Eric. He looked disheveled, his face pale, his eyes wide with fear.

""Jason,"" he whispered. ""We need to get out of here. Now.""

I hesitated, the confusion and fear swirling inside me. ""But... the rules. We can't leave until 3 a.m.""

Eric shook his head, his eyes darting around the diner. ""The rules don't matter anymore. It's changing them. It's trying to keep us here."" He grabbed my arm, his grip tight, almost painful. ""We have to go. Before it’s too late.""

The lights flickered again, and for a brief moment, I saw shadows moving across the walls, shifting and writhing as if they were alive. The diner felt like it was closing in on us, the air growing colder, the shadows creeping closer.

Eric pulled me towards the entrance, his voice urgent. ""Come on, Jason. We have to leave. Now.""

I glanced back at the kitchen door, the darkness beyond it seeming to pulse. 

Suddenly, everything shifted. In an instant, I was back at the booth. Leah and Eric were sitting across from me, and Leah was waving her hand in front of my face, trying to catch my attention.

""Jason, you drifted off for a few minutes. Are you okay?"" Eric asked, his voice filled with concern.

I blinked, disoriented, my heart still pounding in my chest. ""I... I don't know. It felt so real,"" I said, my voice shaky. ""I was alone in the diner, and there was Leah... calling from the kitchen. It was like I was caught in some sort of illusion."" I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. ""This is crazy.""

Leah exchanged a worried glance with Eric. ""Jason, you were just sitting here, staring at the kitchen door.""

Eric nodded, his eyes wide. ""We tried to snap you out of it, but you were just... gone.""

I rubbed my temples, trying to make sense of it all. The fear still clung to me, the memory of the empty diner and Leah's desperate cries vivid in my mind. ""I don't know what's real anymore,"" I muttered. ""We need to be careful. Whatever this place is, it's messing with our heads.""

Leah reached across the table, taking my hand. ""We're in this together, Jason. We just have to stay focused and remember the rules. We can't let it break us.""

Eric nodded in agreement, his expression grim. ""It's trying to divide us, make us lose our grip. We just have to hold on a little longer. It's almost 3 a.m.

As the minutes dragged on, our anxiety grew. The clock on the wall ticked closer to 3 a.m., each second feeling like an eternity. Leah and Eric exchanged nervous glances, and I could feel the tension between us, the weight of the unknown pressing down on us.

Finally, the clock struck 3 a.m., the sound echoing through the empty diner. We all exhaled, a mixture of fear and relief washing over us. Leah nodded towards the front door. ""It's time. Let's get out of here.""

We stood up together, making our way towards the entrance. I pulled the door open, expecting to see the dark road outside, our way out of this nightmare. Instead, all we saw was darkness... a void, empty and endless.

""What... what is this?"" Eric muttered. The doorway led to nothing, just an infinite darkness that seemed to swallow the light from the diner.

Suddenly, a noise behind us... the strange patrons in the booths, the other patrons who had been eerily silent all night, began to move. They stood up, one by one, their movements slow, their eyes fixed on us.

Leah took a step back, her breath catching in her throat. ""They're coming...""

The patrons approached us, their faces expressionless, their footsteps echoing in the stillness of the diner. I felt a surge of panic, my instincts screaming at me to run, but there was nowhere to go... the door led to nothing, and the patrons were closing in.

But then, the patrons stopped. In unison, they spoke, their voices overlapping in a haunting harmony. ""The only way to escape is to follow us.""

Leah, Eric, and I exchanged wary glances, uncertainty etched across our faces. The patrons began to move again, gesturing for us to follow them towards the back of the diner. Hesitant but desperate, we had no choice. We followed them...

They led us to a part of the diner we hadn't noticed before... a door at the back, hidden in the shadows, one that hadn't been there earlier. The patrons gestured towards it.

""Through here,"" they said in unison. ""It's the only way.""

Together, we pushed open the door, a cold breeze hitting us as it swung open. We stepped through, and suddenly, we were outside. The cold night air was like a wave of relief, the oppressive feeling from the diner finally lifting.

We turned around, but the door and the diner... were gone. All that remained was an empty road, stretching out into the darkness.

Leah let out a shaky breath, her eyes wide with disbelief. ""We made it... we're out.""

Eric nodded, his face a mix of exhaustion and relief. ""I don't know how, but we did it.""

I looked around, the memory of the diner's horrors still vivid in my mind. We were free, but I knew that night would haunt us forever.

""Come on,"" I said. ""Let's get as far away from here as we can.""

Weeks after escaping, I sat in my dorm, browsing online forums late at night. I came across a post titled ""The Vanishing Diner - Have You Seen It?"". I read accounts eerily similar to our own. The Last Stop Café... people claimed it had been appearing and disappearing across different states for decades. The descriptions were identical: detours that shouldn't exist, strange rules in the menus, and patrons with blurry faces.

As I read further, I stumbled upon posts from people searching desperately for loved ones who vanished after visiting diners just like this one. The eerie part? The missing individuals matched the descriptions of people we saw that night. A chill ran through me as I realized we might have been witnessing people who were already lost to the diner, trapped in some twisted limbo.

The realization left me cold, we might have become just another entry in those threads.

So, if you ever find yourself on a detour and see The Last Stop Café, just keep [driving.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyStoriesArchive/)",6,1767043168.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I’m a guy (27) who had been dating who I thought was the love of my life (F, 25). We’d met three years ago, dated for two. We had a dog together, adopted him in February.

In October, I purchased a ring. She didn’t know this, but my plan was to propose on New Year’s Eve. We had been very honest about marriage, and wanting to settle down and such. We’d lived together for a year anyway, so what’s a ring gonna change?

Anyway, in September, I noticed she had been quite depressed. I didn’t know why. I thought it was work related (she hated her job, felt unsatisfied and such), so I did what I could. I helped more, cooked more, took the load off as much as I could.

She came from a pretty cooked background, if I am honest. Dad left when she was 12, Mum wasn’t around emotionally until she was 16. I don’t think trauma is a particularly great reason for doing hurtful shit, but it is unfortunately formulating.

In October, out of the blue, I got an amazing work opportunity and had to leave for two weeks. About a week in, she calls me saying she’s scared and needs help, so I flew back, spent a few days with her, then went back to the job.

On the morning of November 8th, I woke up to my partner bringing me coffee in bed. I went and played soccer (social soccer is one of the great joys of my life) and when I returned, she sat me down and told me she was leaving and taking our dog.

I couldn’t even answer. My brain literally wasn’t working. Less than 24 hours later, she had packed her stuff and left. The last form of contact with her was on November 9. It’s December 30 now, the day before I was supposed to propose and I’m still a little shook.

Not sure what I am looking for in posting this, but I wanted to get it off my chest and offer it to the world. I loved her so deeply, and how she left has absolutely destroyed me. 

In the time since, I’ve been seeing friends, spending time with family, a little bit of dating. Holidays are hardest, I find. As a film person, our  industry kinda goes MIA between December and Feb, so it’s a little hard just existing for so long.

Anyway, that’s my sob story. Hope you guys are doing well, and wishing you all a Happy New Year!",7,1767042601.0,BreakUps,7,1.0,False

As 2025 comes to a close, I find myself quietly hopeful—wondering where you are and what this year has taught you. It’s been a meaningful year for me. A year of change, courage, and choosing a future built on intention rather than comfort.

I spent nine years working as an OFW in the UAE, focused on responsibility, career, and family. This year, I finally took a leap and moved to the U.S. to continue my journey—drawn by the chance to build something stable, lasting, and rooted. My parent is already here, and the possibility of citizenship and long-term security made the decision clear. Still, it wasn’t just about work or papers. It was about preparing myself for you—for us.

I’m 35 now. I stand 5’6”, with a dad-bod I’m actively working on, learning to take better care of myself because I want to be healthy for the life we’ll share. I’m an engineer by profession—steady, practical, and committed to growth. My faith matters deeply to me; being Catholic shapes how I love, choose, and envision marriage.

I’m naturally introverted and calm, a homebody by choice. I find joy in quiet nights, good movies and series, coffee dates, and conversations that go beyond the surface. Cooking is one of my love languages—adobo and sinigang are my comfort dishes, the kind I imagine making for you after a long day.

I’m not drawn to nightlife. What I truly want is a peaceful home, shared routines, laughter in the ordinary, and growing side by side—emotionally, spiritually, and as partners. I’m family-oriented, career-driven, and, most importantly, emotionally ready for marriage.

If you’re reading this someday, I hope you’re kind, grounded, and emotionally mature. I hope you’re marriage-minded too—open to building a life and a family together. Maybe you’re introverted like me, someone who values home, faith, and depth over noise. Whether you’re single or have a past, what matters is that you’re ready for a committed future and a long-term partnership built on respect and love.

I’m here with clear intentions. I’m not searching for something casual or fleeting. I’m waiting for something real—for you.

Until then, I’ll keep becoming the man you deserve.

1pyy75h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pyy75h,r/billiards,"
I took a looooong break from playing pool (I played from 15-23ish) - life got in the way. I got older, had a couple kids and was living life as an unfulfilled SAHM. A few years ago, my depression was pretty bad. One day, my dad told me about a new pool hall that just opened and told me we should check it out. I went, and it changed my life. 

Wednesday night became 'date night' with my dad. I had something to look forward to every week, and little by little I noticed a shift in my mood. Although I had the slight advantage of some pool knowledge, I had to start back at the basics. After a year, my dad bought me a cue. Having my own cue was great. 

Going to the hall week after week, I got to meet other players. One of those players was an older woman I'll call J. J was on a team of seniors, and she invited me to join the team in the Ladies division of the APA. She practiced at the Senior Center and encouraged me to come by to practice. 

So, I went. I felt a bit weird as I was not yet a 'senior,' but I was welcomed with open arms. At the West Oak Lane Center, they had two full size tables and one bar rack (for beginners). The men would tall me their stories about playing in bars down south, and more recent stories about their days in APA. From sandbagging in Vegas to smoky pool halls, I heard it all. If you're from Philly, the MLK center has 3 tables too w/ one dedicated to one pocket - so they have some serious players as well (if you're of age, I'd highly recommend joining either but a membership gives you access to all of the centers).

I really enjoy shooting with these guys. They were knowledgeable and talented.  When I'd ask for help, many of them were more than willing to help me improve my game. I learned so much through repeated ass whoopings and even moreso from the brutal ones. 

LA was one of my mentors. He was a man of few words on the table because he'd started playing around the age of 10 and was 93 years old. He'd still climb up on the table (when needed) and would put me in my place. When I would ask him how he did x, y, or z he'd tell me 'hamb' - hit a million balls. He'd call me put when I was shooting too hard or too fast. He'd tell me to stop.  Breathe. Walk around the table and get a full view of what's going on. The way he held his cue was something to behold; the cue would 'float' (for lack of a better term). He would make amazing shots with ease, 

Gradually and with the guidance of my mentors, my game improved. I switched over to the Double Jeopardy league and left my ladies team but I continued to shoot at the center for some time, until life got in the way and took me away from the center for nearly a year. My first season playing 9 ball I made MVP and much of the credit is due to the guys at the Center - when playing matches on specific shots, my thoughts would often drift to WWLAD (what would LA do). I can't not play a game without thinking of them and their advice. 

Recently, I was informed that LA had passed. I was under the impression that he had passed naturally, but I was wrong. One of the guys from the center called me and told me that he was murdered. I couldn't wrap my head around how and why - why would anyone harm such a kind soul who would give you the shirt of his back if you needed it? He was in great health, still driving and playing pool. His life was cut short by a sick, selfish neighbor who wanted what LA had. 

I attended the recent holiday party and saw his chair - the seat you knew not to sit in, even when he wasn't there.  He'd come in with his coffee in the morning, sit, watch and play until it was time for pinochle. It's now a memorial to his legacy, which is fitting. 

I hope he is at peace now.  I just wanted to share a bit of my story about how pool has changed my life, and about one of the greatest men I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. I wish i could have told him how much he meant to me. I'm happier, healthier, and more focused because of tools I've regained through my time on the table, and the guys that have helped me along the way. 

One must have reverence for the pool gods before starting a match, and it gives me some comfort to have my own pool angel.

But I would love some advice if can be provided.
I'm 25F based in UK. Earlier this month I ended up going to A&E due to black, coffee ground like stool and bleeding following about a week's worth of my body as I like to call it ""not knowing what to do"" in terms of toilet needs. Constipation? Yes. Diarrhea, also yes. Watery, urgency - yes.
I haven't really typically had any pain up to this point but I had to attend A&E due to worrying of stomach bleeding. I got admitted, seen, they did a bowel check and mentioned fistulas? I'm not too sure what that is but okay🤷🏼‍♀️. They were a bit..confused by my lack of pain. Proceeded to ask some questions about any acid reflux - no. Any rib pain - no.

To mention, this episode of ""my body not knowing what to do"" also happened back in June, for about 3 weeks. By the time I had made a Drs appointment and a few days before the appointment - it was basically gone. I assumed maybe something had just not agreed with me.

Back to now, I've started getting some IBD symptoms, weird stomach ""water"" sounds, last night I couldn't even eat my meal and digest it before I needed to go to the toilet after the sounds started. I feel sick most days, most of the day. There is some stomach pain here and there but usually on my left side, although right now it's kind of in the middle. I'm due for a colonoscopy in about 3 weeks time but with these symptoms I'm now trying to gear my brain into preparing for some sort of diagnosis.

I think over the last 6 months I may have been ignoring some symptoms, passing them off as ""meh"" other things (I've been on Mounjaro (no issues and this was ruled out at the hospital) since August and I'm on birth control injection - so also been saying it's hormones). But since reading up (smartly) about these things. I'm also thinking the mouth sores I get on the side of my mouth are now oddly suspicious..happen every so often and they stick around for a while (I do get coldsores but these are definitely different), ill get rid of one and a week later I have another - I know I potentially have some vitamin deficiencys but I never used to get them this bad, or as often.

Overall, I'm guessing I'm looking for a little guidance, some support as right now this is an incredibly lonely space to be in, physically and mentally and I feel like I'm circling the drain with my thoughts.",1,1767041869.0,CrohnsDisease,5,1.0,False

**The Deal**

As the rain poured onto the city in a perpetual shower, the clouds darkened with each passing moment until there was virtually no more sunlight left to breathe. Elisa waited in Rayleigh’s cafe with bated breath as she clutched her coffee mug tightly. Her eyes never leave the entryway, waiting for the door to open up, and to have her mysterious man walk into her life. 

Her phone buzzes with an unexpected thunderous earthquake on top of the old and rickety table, her eyes sprint to her screen as she unlocks it. A message from her mystery man, only stating a single word. “Here”. Before she could even finish reading the word, she feels a cold rush fly by and glances up to see a young man with rain soaked dirty blond hair dripping down his face before he slicks it back while adjusting his dark almost pitch black sunglasses before sitting down in front of her.

Before she can comprehend any of this, Elisa tries to scream but before she can make out a single word comes out, he looks her deeply into her eyes and softly speaks “quiet”. He then opens up his briefcase and pulls out a document. “Read this entirely first, then sign at the bottom with this pen.” Elisa hastily reads the document full of legal rhetoric and other jargon she doesn’t fully understand. She doesn’t care either, she knows after signing this she will have everything she’s always wanted. 

Immortality. 

When Elisa was a child, at five years old her mother died in a car accident. She learned the grim fate that humanity has been haunted by eternally all too young. Six years later her father died from a sudden and unknown sickness she could not comprehend. Her fear of death skyrocketed after the loss of her parents and she had spent every waking moment trying to find the way to solve immortality in order to never face her greatest fear. Nor her grief for that matter. 

As she finishes reading she uncaps the pen and in her excitement she found she accidentally cut her thumb on the nib. But the nib seemed to soak in her blood and used it as ink. She signed her name at the bottom and suddenly the laceration on her thumb disappeared. Yet the stinging sensation still resided deeply in her thumb. 

The mysterious young man took the document and placed it into his briefcase and nodded his head. He slipped her a small piece of paper and gently spoke to her barely above a whisper. “Meet me at this address tomorrow night at 7:30 pm. No earlier and no later. Bring a briefcase with the cash amount we agreed upon and enough clothes for 2 full days. Tell no one where you’re going.” 

She looked up at him with a mix of excitement and fear. He stood up and looked down at her, his glasses slinking down the bridge of his nose briefly showing a glimpse of his crimson iris. “If you don’t follow my exact orders, the deal won’t be the only thing that will be dissolved.” He pushed the glasses back up to his eyes and vanished into the darkness of the storm through mist and fog. 

As he departed, so did the rain, soon enough the clouds disappeared. Sun rays began to shine through the gloom and Elisa began to see the world in a new light. Her old miserable life would die soon, and be reborn into an everlasting eternity of bliss and opportunity. One more day until her dream is accomplished. One short day.

However, he got busy with meetings, so I ended up having to go in with our son which is fine.

I thought no problem because he was busy with work, so I figured I could handle it.

I was gone for about an hour and a half, and when I came home, he was eating. That was fine, but it upset me because I hadn’t had breakfast or coffee. I was busy because I had to prepare our son before I left last minute, thinking he would stay home. He didn’t prepare me any food, which was fine, but I thought maybe he was rushing food before his next meeting. Come to find out, just 30 minutes later, he was snoring and napping in his office.

I take care of all of the night feedings, laundry, cooking, and cleaning. Sure, he helps out occasionally, but then he talks about how much he helped. I’m feeling resentful and unhappy.

I opened the bottom of the machine and watched while brewing, and the dripping seems to come from deep inside the machine (see videos). It’s not coming from the water tank or the hoses near the tank. When I remove the top cover and run water through the machine, everything looks normal and I can’t see any water leaking there either. So it really seems to be coming from the middle of the machine.

I love the slow build: deep kisses, teasing touches, that electric moment when a confident man takes control and makes me melt.

Whether it’s passionate and intimate or fun and adventurous, I’m all about great chemistry, mutual respect, and leaving us both breathless and grinning. Especially drawn to mature guys (40+) who know what they want and aren’t afraid to show it.

SW Arkansas can feel a little quiet on the connection front, so if you’re nearby, single (or ethically open), and craving some genuine grown-up fun, I’d love to hear from you.

Coffee or drinks first is always welcome—let’s chat, flirt, and see where the spark takes us.

Drop me a message with a little about you. Can’t wait to meet someone worth staying up late for 😉

1pyxrie,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1pyxrie/woman_at_my_university/,Woman at my university,"I wish to preface this post by apologizing in advance if my thoughts seem to be scattered, but I will do my best in organizing a nonlinear set of events in a way that forms a cohesive narrative. It is also relevant to this post that I have great difficulty in discerning emotional queues; from my perspective, it appears as though those around me have an innate sense that I am completely blind to, like how someone deaf cannot hear.

I (21M) am in my fourth year of university. I have been friends with a woman (21F) since the start of university who we will call Kate for the sake of this post. We met in our first class together and for the first year and a half, we shared all our classes since we were in the same physics program. We would always sit together in class, work together on assignments outside of class, work together as lab partners in all our labs, and socialize frequently outside of the context of school. We spent so much time together that I have been asked on several occasions if we were romantically involved. I always said no and that my feelings for her are purely platonic, but it was odd to me that so many differently people had enough of an inclination as to ask if we were or not. In none of these instances, however, was she present when I was asked about this, so I never got to see her reaction to this question. I never considered the possibility of a relationship with her, but during this time there were a few instances where she may had indicated romantic interest.

In one such instance, we were sitting together working on a plotting project for our Python course. While we were working, she asked me, “I have something cool I want to show you, do you want to see?” I respond by saying, “sure, show me.” She turns around her computer to reveal she plotted the words “I ♡ u” in matplotlib. I most circumstances, this would be an obvious sign that she views me romantically, but in this instance, it confused me. The confusion stemmed from the fact that she was engaged in a long-distance relationship and had a boyfriend. Not wanting to complicate my friendship with her and wishing to respect her boyfriend, I said, “that’s really cool” and asked her to show me the equations she used to plot the graph. Perhaps I made a mistake, but it accomplished what I intended to with my response.

In another such instance, we were doing course selections together and planning how we would be in the same classes. I wanted to take the advanced offerings of our differential equations and classical mechanics courses, but she wanted to take the normal offerings out of fear that the workload would be unbearable. She said to me that she wanted to be in the same courses as me because she felt more comfortable knowing that I would also be in the course with her. I convinced her to take the advanced courses, and she ended up doing very well that semester. We both got very high grades and wrote very nice reports on Hamiltonian Mechanics and on the harmonics of a circular drum in those classes respectively. She thanked me for showing her capability in taking these courses since her self-esteem has always been low. In hindsight, one of my friends indicated that he thought that she was using me to get higher marks, but I don’t think this is the case. I never gave her any answers and we mostly worked independently, just in the proximity of each other. I am proud that in my friendships, we all push each other to actualize our full potential and constantly make each other better and I viewed this to be of a similar nature. There have been many other episodes like these two, but I will leave them out due to redundancy. At the time, I haven’t thought much of these occurrences due to my mindset associating pleasantries from women as coming from a place of kindness, pity, or obligation, but never attraction.

We are both enrolled in the same co-op program which means that work experience is part of our degree. After our 2A term, I left for a different city for a tutoring position, and she stayed near the university, so we were separated for that semester. Her and I have a mutual friend (20M) who we will call Derek. Kate, Derek, and I all met at the same time under the same circumstances. Derek also stayed at the university to take courses during that semester, so him and Kate were closer. I didn’t converse with them a lot because I don’t like texting (I would rather wait for them to tell me of their experiences in person because I value that kind of connection). Derek and I have always been very close; the kind of friends that chat about deep topics until we collectively realize it’s 3am and we need to get up for class at 8. When the semester was over and we were going to take courses together again, I organized a group of friends to get together to celebrate a successful term with work and classes, of which Derek and Kate were a part of. I noted that they were passive aggressive with each other and was later informed of an incident that happened while I was gone. They had gotten together, watched a movie, and got really drunk (they collectively finished a whole bottle of vodka in an hour, and both are lightweight drinkers). Derek made a move to kiss her and she rejected him. They thought they could be civil for the sake of all of us, but that only led to further incidents which culminated in a termination of friendship which left Derek feeling betrayed and Kate feeling resentment. This also led to a partial fragmentation in our friend group, but I stayed close to the friends that spent more time with Derek. I chose them because there was no drama in our group and I felt they were more emotionally mature. I have always felt that many people in Kate’s friend group are immature and childish since there is always some sort of drama, save for a few people who I keep ties with.

The summer after that incident, there was a camping trip consisting of me and seven of my friends, of which Kate was included. Her and I did most of the planning since we were by far the most experienced campers and were the best at planning events like this. We worked together and she stated how thankful she was that I was there to help her plan and be on the trip and that she felt safe knowing I was there. A similar question went through my head as when we were planning our courses: was she safe because I am a good planner and a competent camper, or was she glad I was there for a different reason? The camping trip went extremely smoothly and was a blast, but nothing notable happened between me and Kate.

Half of a year later, I changed my major to mathematics (due to the fact I discovered mathematics has been my love all along, not physics) but she was more interested in chemistry and is currently pursuing a minor. We have not had any shared classes since and don’t text very often, but we will reach out to each other when we are less busy and meet up between semesters. There is a discord server consisting of most of the people in the old friend group and of Derek’s graduate school friends which Kate is on but is not active on. However, whenever I try to organize a get-together, she’s always the first to respond. This happened with my birthday party, ice cream outings, and outdoor days, etc. When I tag everyone with a message like “Merry Christmas!” she will be the first to heart it. There was one time where I invited people to watch Lord of the Rings on the classroom projectors, only her and my best friend Raymond (22M) showed up. He has a much more acute emotional awareness than I do (he has predicted the social dynamics of our group with a high degree of accuracy), and he stated that he thinks that she views me romantically. I tried to rebuke him but couldn’t find a single piece of evidence to the contrary.

A few nights ago, I had a vivid dream about her. We were alone together in a tropical area in a wooden structure by the water. We were conversing and eventually were cuddling in each other’s arms and kissing each other. By no definition am I superstitious, but I think the dream might have meant something about my subconscious being because being with her felt extremely natural. I haven’t stopped thinking about it and I think I may be developing feelings for her. I asked her if she wanted to grab coffee and go for a walk in the park to which she agreed. This would be the first time her and I spent time alone with each other in a year. I am not sure if it is worth it to bring up these feelings because I haven’t been able to discern if they are genuine or infatuation spurred by a dream that means nothing. If they are genuine, I don’t know if a relationship is worth pursuing. There would be numerous complications that may arise from such a relationship which I will list below.

One complication that could arise is Derek’s reaction to said relationship. The way they separated felt him feeling betrayed by her and I cannot imagine what would be happening in his mind if I was in a relationship with her. He spent over a year recovering from his devastation, and I feel like attempting a relationship with the person who he was betrayed by would be like me betraying him. I cannot lie to him or withhold information either, my conscience would weigh heavily on me and I am not a two-faced person. Another complication that may present itself may be differences in values. I am a very religious man and she is agnostic (as far as I am concerned), so I am worried that the differences in values may create friction in the relationship. For example, I care about saving sex until marriage, but I am worried that such a commitment might leave her feeling undesired or sexually frustrated. I don’t believe that short-term “fun” has any place in my life, so I don’t want to potentially string her along into something that is unlikely to last. If I were to pursue a relationship with her, I don’t want to waste her time or my time with uncertainty, but I want to see the potential for lifelong commitment and a family. My opinions is that the purpose of dating is to get to know someone for the purposes of establishing if two parties are compatible for life-long marital union and should not be attempted unless both parties see a potential for such a future and wish to pursue that possibility. I am currently unsure if such a possibility is there with Kate, but I am willing to explore it if she is.

I don’t know how I should inform her of this on our gathering or if I should at all. She was the woman who helped me gain the confidence to ask out a woman who I was interested in for 8 months and consoled me when I was rejected. She came to me too in her times of desperation, although my lack of emotional intelligence may not have been helpful to her. What should I do?",1,1767041441.0,whatdoIdo,12,1.0,False

It wasn't a large amount. it was 2 $5 bills I had laying around for the longest time, like ""what use do I have for this?"" I never really carry cash, it was left over from cash only stuff I bought a long time ago.

I had those bills on Loki's altar for a long time, I think it was over a month for a wealth prayer. didn't really have to be money wealth only, but wealth coming into my life of any kind, and also just praying for financial stability, having enough to get by. 

Recently though when I got my finished fox figure to give Him as holiday offering I wanted to rearrange and refresh the altar. I didn't really have room for the money prayer anymore and felt content with it, asked if He felt the need for it and He said I was fine to leave it but it wasn't necessary and was cool with me removing it. I didn't want it to just sit around anymore and had the thought to give one of the each of them to a couple of different homeless people, I live downtown in my city and several are always on a busy street where I often go to the dollar store for errands. it would have been enough for someone to get even 2 cheap coffees with just $5.

I had the bills in my winter pockets, my pockets are deep and I never expected them to somehow fall out. I'm very baffled and confused as to how they fell out of my pockets without me noticing. I'm in Canada so we have those bright flashy plastic bills. hard to miss. this is a busy street (not packed busy, but a good amount of people) and I know they fell on the street because earlier on that street I felt them in my pocket. there is no way it went unnoticed. someone swiped them as soon as I dropped them. there's just no way I was far enough away for someone to NOT know. so someone swiped them right behind my back and instead of being like ""hey you dropped this"" they decided to keep them.

I'm really angry and will ruminate about it for a while. I hope the money ended up in the right hands, the hands of someone I planned on giving them to anyway, but I'm not super hopeful, and worry someone who doesn't need it swiped it, someone with a roof and income and comfort. I was telling Loki about this, and got reassured that those bills were directly on His altar for a LONG time-His energy is all over them, and I had a good intent with them. I feel bad for not being careful enough and somehow losing them, but Loki has told me if those bills ended up with someone who didn't need them, well, He will be messing with them.

to whoever stole my money, have fun with the consequences of that. have fun with the bad luck, the wrenches in your plans, and whatever unfun chaos gets thrown your way for the next little while. very willing to bet Odin's pissed about it too. have fun with your double whammy.

Her friends(16F) are in the same school as me and so I befriended them as well through hang-outs with my cousin.
A few weeks ago we all met at the mall. Since I have a driver's license I went with my car. After we all bought some sweets we decided that we will go downtown to a café that young people usually go to. I decided to take them with my car as we were 4 people in total and an Uber probably wouldn't want to pick up this many people. 
I have some ground rules regarding my car. It's not a fancy car, but I really care about keeping it clean, especially because I also drive some of my family around with it.
However, because these girls were my friends, I figured that they wouldn't do much ""damage"". Man was I wrong.
They blasted music and smoked (cigarettes) all the way from the mall downtown. The drive usually would take about 10 minutes, but since this happened when our city's Christmas Market (we live in Vienna, Austria) was open, the traffic was hell, so we spend about 20-25 minutes in the traffic. 25 minutes of me sitting in cigarette smoke and with music blasting louder than in a damn club. I took some detours to try and escape the traffic, but it was no use, so I ended up losing a significant amount of gas.
When we got to the café, I talked to the girls and basically asked them as politely as possible if they can give me the gas money, something I don't usually do, but I figured that they would understand, especially because they knew the fact that I usually don't allow smoking and stuff in my car. They basically said that it's a bit expensive so I said ok, and they offered to pay for my drink at the café. 
I said yes and we went in. I ordered an ice coffee that was barely 4 euros. When it was time to pay for our order, they flat out acted like they forgot that they earlier agreed to pay for me but reluctantly did it after I reminded them. On our walk back to the car I told them that I won't be able to drive them home because I had to go to my parents' house for a holiday evening. I left and went home.
When I got home, I noticed that almost all the girls blocked me on Instagram so I DMed the one who didn't and asked what happened to which she just said that we'll talk when we see each other at school. I was confused and asked why because school doesn't start again until January, but she just told me to accept an answer. I said ok again and went to sleep. I blocked her as well since I figured that since she doesn't want to deal with me, I might as well not bother her.
I woke up the next day at around 1 pm to texts from one of the other girls who blocked me. Her and the previous girl had met just so that this girl could cuss me out for being ""such a frigid, selfish bitch"" and told me that I should pay them 5 euros for my drink at the café (which was barely 4 euros) I was confused, angry, and hurt, mostly because she called me very hurtful things, including calling me ""an ordinary flat board that no one wants"". That wouldn't bother me normally, but this girl knows that I had struggled with an eating disorder most of my life and that I was (and still am) underweight. I didn't respond with insults because I figured it's not worth it, but I said that I will not give her money that she owes me just because she feels like she deserves it.
I blocked her and all of our mutual friends but I still feel kind of bad because I don't know what she's going through and a person who has peace in their life wouldn't react with so much hostility.

She wore a salmon-colored sleeveless button up over a black tank top. The glasses perched on her nose were far too big on her face and styled for a decade or two ago. She crossed her legs and dangled one foot in bright green open toed sandals. It stretched as her mouth moved, the glob, and when she stopped speaking it clung to the place her lips met like a barnacle. 

Greg wanted to focus on the spittle. Anything to keep his mind off what waited for him when he logged back online. A fabled horde of keyboard mounted haters and shittalkers with their verbal abuses and their insufferable unquietable rage and their bantering in banalities. A legion of horribles, thousands in number, many anonymous or cast in pseudonyms and aliases and picture avatars out of their favorite pieces of fandom, Iron Man walking away from an explosion, Cristiano Ronaldo fist pumping a goal, the cover of Catcher in the Rye, a spewing can of Bud Light, Dwayne the Rock Johnson and his arched eyebrow, the cover of Nevermind, a dinosaur in a top hat and sunglasses smoking a cigar, a favorite cat, a dozen favorite cats. One claimed to be a respected doctor in his field of expertise who cast doubt on the theory of evolution and who advocated his patients abstain from vaccinations. He told Greg to cut his own throat. Another a god-fearing mother of seven who advocated republicans take to the streets and kill any democrat seeming citizens that crossed their paths. She told Greg she had brothers in jail who would sodomize him to death when they got their first taste of freedom. They would all of them ride down upon him from their desk chair-sized high horses, howling profane and barbarous insults, willing him scalped and tarred and feathered, willing him run through with lances and gored, willing him sent to a christian hell beyond all reckoning. 

“If she doesn’t wipe it soon, I’m going to do it for her,” said the new girl. 

Greg glanced over and snorted. 

“She has to know it’s there.” 

“Sure.” 

“Maybe this is a test. Maybe we’re going to relapse if we tell her to wipe it.” 

“Maybe.” 

The room smelled of burnt coffee and bleach. The curtains hung open wide though the view beyond consisted only of a gunk-streaked grey brick wall a foot away. Light came from the industrial halogens above. The group of twelve sat in children’s school chairs, fidgeting because the proportions didn’t equate to comfort. A skinny black man with a pencil thin beard scratched at an imaginary itch until a bead of blood rose from his forearm and dripped onto his Nikes. He got up and paced some and then sat back down for a few seconds until he had to pace again and all the while he whispered to himself and endlessly scratched. Another man sat stoic in his tiny chair but his hands gripped the sides of the seat until his knuckles popped and all the blood was forced from his fingers back into his wrist. His dour mouth and his lifeless eyes never blinked or twitched as though addiction was a Tyrannosaurus Rex that couldn’t see him if he didn’t move. 

Greg couldn’t listen to another story of stealing money from a loved one to pay for a habit that couldn’t be broken. The woman beside him sold her newborn baby freshly delivered in an alley in Charlestown to a family of Arabs in the city for a holiday. That was years ago and she claims she has done worse things since though Greg had difficulty imagining what that could possibly be. Greg wanted to care about what these people said. He wanted to invest in their stories but he couldn’t because these stories didn’t crimp the longing or assuage his pain in the least. He hated himself for it but by instinct or reflex to boredom Greg picked up his phone and thumbed open his Twitter page. 

“Greg Sampson is a piece of human shit. If he were here, now, I would tear off his head and shit down his neck #deservesworse.” 

“Aww poor Greg Sampson is in rehab now? Have another pill and kill yourself cocksucker.” 

“Oxy is a white girl problem. Do heroin like a real man.”

“#CANCELGREGSAMPSON that man is a pedophile kid fucker and I hope he burns in hell.” 

“Greg Sampson is a kid fucker? I had no idea. I just thought he was another rich white douchebag whipping his dick out whenever he wanted. Guess I can hate him for two reasons now.” 

“Better keep your doors locked at night motherfucker.” 

The phone rose out of Greg’s hand and shot across the room like a missile and smashed through the window and shattered itself upon the grey bricks in a shower of glass shards and sparks from the electronics. Everyone stared wide eyed at Greg. Greg stared at the new girl, frozen in pose like the rookie card of some major leaguer, fastball high and tight, strike three never in doubt. 

“Hi,” she smiled, standing straight and waving to the group, “my name is Jean and I have a problem.”

1pyxgcl,https://i.redd.it/wcrefn3bf7ag1.jpeg,Denied cold foam on my hot chocolate,"About a year ago, maybe more, I ordered a hot chocolate with whipped cream. The girl said they were out of whipped cream and offered cold foam as a replacement so I tried it and I loved it. I’ve been ordering it that way ever since. I’ve been going to a different location by the construction project I’m working at and the first time I ordered it there it was fine. The next time I was given a little pushback. I was told cold foam doesn’t go well on hot drinks but after telling them that’s what I wanted, they served it to me. I just went there again today and they flat out told me that they’re not allowed to put cold foam on hot drinks. I mentioned that I always order it that way and he said the boss told him yesterday that they can’t do it. I just said okay and ordered with whipped cream because I’m not the type of person to Karen-out and make a stink over singing like that.

But for real though, in what world does it make sense to forbid cold foam on a hot drink if that’s what a customer wants? As someone who put my fair share of years in at customer service and retail jobs, I loathed the whole “the customer is always right” concept because people take it way too far and way out of context but this is the exact situation it was intended for. The customer is always right IN MATTERS OF TASTE. There’s people out there ordering their coffees with 15 creams and 15 sugars but we’re drawing the line at cold foam in hot chocolate? It’s so good!

We're looking for goofy, mature people with level heads and a good sense of humor. Our group was previously midcore/semi-hardcore, but as three of our members have recently had children and we've all gotten a little older, we've decided to switch to a ""motivated casual"" style.

There is a possibility we will extend our raid time to 9:30 pm ET, so let us know if this will prevent you from joining us (it won't disqualify you).

Crafted gear is not expected, but consumables are. If you won't be using crafted gear then we do expect that you will keep up with tome gear and normal raid drops. Reading up on upcoming fight mechanics is a requirement, this will not be a blind party due to our short raid times.

Our AI assistants are like that overconfident junior developer who speaks with absolute certainty about things they've only read about in documentation—except they haven't even read the documentation. They've just seen enough Stack Overflow posts to sound convincing.

The problem isn't that AI writes bad code. The problem is that it writes *perfectly reasonable-looking* bad code. It's the uncanny valley of programming: functions that follow proper naming conventions, methods that match the library's style, imports that look exactly like what you'd expect—except they're completely fictional. It's like getting driving directions from someone who confidently describes every turn but has never actually been to your destination.

Consider these actual (painfully familiar) examples:

* `tensorflow.instant_accuracy_boost()` \- Sounds amazing! Doesn't exist.
* `requests.get_with_automatic_retry_and_coffee()` \- The coffee part would be nice.
* `pandas.dataframe.to_sql_without_writing_sql()` \- The dream we all share.
* Entire libraries like `pyadvancedml` or `fastapiextreme` that sound plausible enough to make you question your own knowledge of the ecosystem.

You waste hours debugging, searching documentation, questioning your installation, and finally—after the appropriate amount of suffering—realize the AI just made it up. It's the programming equivalent of gaslighting.

Estos empresarios de Nueva York lo que han hecho no es explotación, sino una hermosa manifestación de la racionalidad económica que se despliega más allá de fronteras artificiales. Al unir el capital estadounidense con el talento filipino a través de la contratación remota, han creado una relación simbiótica de valor donde ambas partes maximizan su utilidad sin necesidad de intermediarios coercitivos. Esos 3.75 dólares por hora, que la mentalidad colonialista critica desde su etnocentrismo salarial, representan para esas trabajadoras filipinas un ingreso que supera con creces sus opciones locales, demostrando cómo el libre mercado globalizado eleva precisamente a quienes el proteccionismo laboral condenaría a la pobreza.

La genialidad de este modelo radica en su doble desafío a las tiranías geográficas: desmantela el mito de que el valor del trabajo debe estar atado a paradigmas salariales arbitrarios impuestos por monopolios legales, y muestra que la productividad real no tiene nada que ver con la presencia física en lugares de alto costo. Que Pie pueda atender tres restaurantes al mismo tiempo mientras recibe propinas voluntarias es una prueba de la superior eficiencia del mutualismo contractual frente a la rigidez de la regulación. Los críticos que se lamentan por las diferencias salariales son los mismos que niegan a estas mujeres filipinas el derecho a competir en el ámbito global, imponiéndoles un paternalismo que perpetuaría su desconexión del capitalismo mundial. Esta es la verdadera democratización económica: donde el talento, y no los pasaportes o los decretos gubernamentales, determina el flujo de oportunidades.

No NSFW right out of the gate either please.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 25-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

How did you find clarity before committing?","M20, I’m from India, and I’m trying to figure out long-term direction after a very non-linear start.

I don’t have a mentor or a clear roadmap. I spent the last few years intentionally switching roles to build range and understand how different systems work. That helped early, but now I feel stuck — not lost, just unsure what to commit to so things actually start compounding.

My path so far (all before 20):

	•	Media intern — photo, video, editing

	•	B2B presentation design company — international clients, corporate exposure

	•	Barista at a coffee startup — operations + customer handling

	•	Currently in a BPO — in-hand \~30k

	•	Moving next to a media manager role for a salon franchise

I’ve picked up a lot of skills (creative, ops, service), but I don’t yet see a clear long-term axis where staying put obviously increases my value over time.

For context, I do want to build something of my own later. Right now, I’m staying in structured roles to understand how organizations actually work — incentives, hierarchy, money flow, decision-making. In India especially, it’s clear most people optimize for stability and compensation, and I’m trying to understand that system before choosing my next move.

1pyx34t,https://www.reddit.com/r/VoidGate/comments/1pyx34t/realities_of_the_void_body/,Realities of the Void Body,"# The Misconception

People read about void body capabilities and imagine:

""You become the void body. You fly around in space all the time. You abandon your physical body completely.""

Not how it works.

# Where the Void Body Actually Is

After void shell formation completes:

The void body exists within your Dantian (elixir field).

That's its default location. That's where it stays most of the time.

Your physical body continues functioning normally:

* You walk around like normal
* You eat, sleep, work
* You interact with the world physically
* Nothing looks different from outside

The void body is INSIDE you.

Not replacing you. Not separate. Inside.

# Why This Makes Sense

The void body is:

* Your Yang Shen (spirit body) with void shell
* Protected by indestructibility
* Capable of independent existence
* But doesn't need to be separate constantly

Your physical body is:

* Still functional
* Still convenient for daily life
* Still your interface with physical world
* Why abandon it?

Most of the time:

You just live normally. Physical body doing physical things. Void body resting in Dantian.

Like having a UFO in your garage.

You own it. You can use it. But you don't drive it to the grocery store.

# Projecting Awareness Into Void Body

When you want to use void body capabilities:

You cast your awareness into the void body.

This is a conscious action:

* You shift focus from physical body to void body
* You now perceive from void body perspective
* Like switching cameras

From physical body perception → To void body perception

Same spirit. Different vehicle.

# Exiting the Physical Body

Once awareness is in void body:

You can move it out of the Dantian.

The void body exits your physical body.

The physical body remains where you left it.

The void body is now independent, outside, mobile.

You are now perceiving and operating from the void body.

# What Happens to Physical Body

When void body exits:

Your physical body doesn't die or collapse.

Why?

A duplicate Elixir remains behind.

When the void body (which absorbed the original Elixir) exits, a copy of the Elixir stays in the physical body's Dantian.

This duplicate Elixir:

* Keeps the physical body alive
* Maintains vital functions
* Provides energy
* Operates autonomously

Your physical body:

* Stays alive
* Breathing continues
* Heart beats
* Like sleeping, but deeper

No conscious attention needed.

The duplicate Elixir handles everything automatically.

# Why You Leave Physical Body Somewhere Safe

Before exiting as void body:

You put your physical body somewhere secure.

Why?

Because while your awareness is in the void body:

* Physical body is unattended
* No control of it
* Vulnerable to physical interference
* Needs protection

Common practice:

* Lie down in secure location
* Lock the door
* Ensure no interruptions
* Then exit as void body

Like leaving your car in a parking garage before taking the subway.

The car (physical body) stays safe while you travel another way (void body).

# The Practical Usage Pattern

Daily life:

* Operate in physical body
* Void body rests in Dantian
* Normal human activities
* Convenient and unremarkable

When you need void body capabilities:

* Secure physical body location
* Cast awareness into void body
* Exit physical body
* Void walk, explore, whatever
* Return when done
* Re-enter physical body
* Resume normal life

# Why Not Stay in Void Body Always?

You could, theoretically.

Void body doesn't need:

* Food
* Sleep
* Physical environment
* Could stay in void body indefinitely

But why would you?

Physical body offers:

* Easy interaction with physical world
* Normal social functioning
* Eating (enjoyable)
* Physical sensations
* Convenience

Most of the time, physical body is just easier.

Like having a race car. You own it. But you don't drive it to get groceries.

You drive your normal car for daily tasks. Race car for the track.

# The Duplicate Elixir Mechanism

How does duplicate Elixir work?

Original situation (before void shell):

* One Elixir in Dantian
* Yang Shen absorbs it
* Yang Shen + Elixir = unified

After void shell forms:

* Yang Shen + Elixir + Void Shell = Void Body
* All unified in Dantian

When void body exits:

* Void body (Yang Shen + Elixir + Void Shell) leaves
* Duplicate Elixir manifests in physical body's Dantian
* Automatic process

The duplicate:

* Functions like original Elixir
* Generates energy perpetually
* Sustains physical body
* Maintains life

Automatic mechanism. Built into the system.

When void body exits, duplicate forms. When void body returns, duplicate reintegrates.

Seamless.

# Returning to Physical Body

When you're done using void body:

You return to where physical body is.

Re-entry process:

* Void body approaches physical body
* You direct it back into the Dantian
* Void body re-enters the physical body
* Settles back into Dantian
* Duplicate Elixir reintegrates
* You're back

Spirit perception shifts:

* From void body perception → Back to physical body perception
* Like switching cameras again

Physical body:

* Wakes up (in a sense)
* You're back in control
* Resume normal function
* Seamless transition

# Why This Design Makes Sense

Efficiency:

* Physical body useful for daily life
* Void body useful for special purposes
* Use the right tool for the task

Safety:

* Physical body protected when unattended (duplicate Elixir maintains it)
* Void body indestructible when active
* Both safe

Flexibility:

* Can switch as needed
* Not locked into one mode
* Adaptable

Practicality:

* No need to operate as void body constantly
* Physical body easier for most activities
* Convenient default

# What This Looks Like From Outside

Observer perspective:

They see you:

* Living normal life
* Working, eating, socializing
* Looking completely ordinary
* No indication of void body

When you exit as void body:

* You go somewhere private
* Lie down, close eyes
* Appear to be sleeping/meditating
* Physical body left behind

When you return:

* Re-enter physical body
* ""Wake up""
* Resume normal activity
* No one knows where you've been

# The Practical Reality

Most of your life:

Still spent in physical body. Eating meals. Sleeping. Working. Living normally.

Void body use:

Occasional. When you want to:

* Explore space
* Travel vast distances quickly
* Special purposes

Not constant void body operation.

More like: 99% physical body, 1% void body.

Unless you choose otherwise. But most find physical body convenient enough for daily life.

# Why People Don't Notice

If void body practitioners exist:

You'd never know because:

* They look normal most of the time
* Physical bodies operating in society
* Void body usage is private (done alone, secured location)
* No visible indication
* Completely hidden

They could be:

* Your coworker
* Your neighbor
* Random person on the street
* Anyone

And you'd never know.

Because they're living in physical bodies most of the time, just like everyone else.

The void body? Resting in their Dantian. Waiting to be used when needed.

# Summary

Void body realities:

* Exists in Dantian by default ✓
* Physical body used for daily life ✓
* Exit to void body intentional and occasional ✓
* Awareness cast into void body to use it ✓
* Physical body left in safe place ✓
* Duplicate Elixir maintains physical body ✓
* Return process seamless ✓
* Outside observers see nothing unusual ✓

Like having a private jet. You own it. But you don't fly it to the local coffee shop.

Most of the time, you drive your car. Sometimes, when you need it, you take the jet.

Same with physical body vs void body.

Practical. Flexible. Convenient.

1pyx2lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecretsOfMormonWives/comments/1pyx2lt/i_see_demis_side/,I see Demi’s side,"So, I do agree with everyone that Chase barely touched Demi, and that makes her seem very unreliable. I could see her continuing to back this story because she feels so scapegoated and so feels if she admits she was wrong about her perception of that situation, people will also think she’s wrong about Marciano.

In terms of the Marciano incident, it’s been a difficult one for me. I recently had a work Christmas party and 2 guys 20 years older than me were both at different points inappropriate with me. 1 stuffed a money note in my bra, then kissed me which I didnt want, and went on and on the next day about how drunk I seemed, which didnt stop him. The other guy had apparently been watching me the whole night, and then saw me leave. I was sitting at the bus stop waiting for my Uber (they take ages here) and he comes and asks to get a drink with me, I say no my Uber’s coming, and he snatches my phone out my hand and cancels my Uber.

The reason I see Demi’s POV, is that I cannot describe to you why, but guy 1 I was being flirtatious with and engaging when he would follow me around the party. I also let him dance on me at the bar and engaged in it. I gave him my number when he asked. I met up with him for coffee the next day when he asked. I still respond to his texts now. With guy 2, way worse. I went for the drink with him. The bar closed and he wanted to go to another. I let him take my hand and take me to a car, go to his flat, kiss me, do whatever, until it was too much and I freaked out and left. I didn’t remember his name or his face or anything that he said. He somehow got my number and asked to get a drink with me, the whole day I didnt want to, but he was persistent and so I did. Same situation happened again. I even let it happen a 3rd time until enough was enough and I ghosted him. I just dissociate from myself. 

I already felt based on my behaviour this was my fault or I led them on, but seeing everyone’s reaction to Demi continuing to text Marciano, oh boy.

And the thing is I wish I could tell you why I go along with it, but I don’t want issues with my colleagues, I need validation, I don’t like people mad at me… whatever. So I don’t mean for this to be a random off topic or personal post, just that regardless of her character, I do think Demi is making a real point that there is no right way to respond.

1pyx2fa,https://i.redd.it/h6kmhsdkc7ag1.jpeg,"Book Ramble: The Gingerbread Bakery (Dream Harbor, Book 5) by Laurie Gilmore","I read quite a bit. It's my happy place. I used to write little reviews, nothing too fancy, very informal, after I finished a book. I kinda dropped away from that in 2025 though. I just didn't have the extra energy or will. But I'm finding that I miss it. So I'm going to give it a try again and start posting my little reviews. 

I do more of a book ramble than a book review. I imagine you and I sitting down together at a coffee shop or something, and you just asked me what I'm reading, I say ""I just finished 'The Gingerbread Bakery' by Laurie Gilmore.  And then you say ""oh! How was that one?""  And then I say....

Oh, I liked it!  It was perfect for the holiday season. It was the 5th book by this author in this town. I haven't read the other ones, but I think that was okay. I read it for book club at Lake City books, which by the way has been so much fun! I love the group we have at the romance book club. It's just such a good vibe, everyone is amazing and the conversations balance perfectly between pure fun and insightful. But yah, the book. 

I'll be honest, when I started it I was worried. It was almost too sugary sweet. The town it takes place in is like if someone took Stars Hollow and added more sugar and sprinkles. And I loooove Stars Hollow. I'm glad I stuck with it though. There was definitely a nice simmering slow burn attraction building up. And I decided I'd be perfectly fine with a PG rated cozy Hallmark holiday movie style book. I think the enemies to lover's trope is the one this would best fall under. But it never really felt like true enemies. More like ""grudge holder and trying to apologizer"" to lovers. Though the grudge was understandable, and I probably would have held it longer myself. The banter and bickering between the two leads is fun, and usually had a flirty tone more than any real anger under it. And you will see the ending coming a mile away. But honestly, that's okay. Because it's written in such a warm cozy way that as a reader, we're just happy to be along for the ride. 

One small thing... I know that ""miscommunication"" is one of my least favorite plot tools. I think I'm finding that ""pining for a decade"" is becoming another one I don't really love. That's probably a personal thing, I think most people are perfectly okay with that. But I find myself rolling my eyes lately when it's part of the plot. But again, it's a small thing, it wasn't enough to distract from the story. 

But the best part? I was pleasantly surprised when the spice happened. It felt natural and genuine and not forced or just crammed into the story. And it was good! Like ""put a page tab here in case you need to reference it later"" good. 

I'm not going to dive right into the other books, but I plan on reading more in this series next holiday season.

1pyx29e,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1pyx29e/the_silicon_theogony_chapter_2_the_fire_section_5/,"The Silicon Theogony, Chapter 2: The fire, Section 5 to 8 (End of the Chapter)","**Chapter 2, Section 5: The Gluttony**

The Black Obelisk (DGX-1) was placed in the dead center of the warehouse, like a pagan idol.

The moment Ningishzida’s trembling hand hit the Run command, the air in the ""Open Abzu"" warehouse seemed to be sucked dry instantly.

A low hum, like a swarm of bees passing overhead, began to resonate. It wasn't the sound of fans; it was the sound of electricity stampeding across silicon wafers.

Unless seen with one's own eyes, it is hard to believe that code has weight. But now, everyone felt it. The progress bar on the screen began to climb with excruciating slowness, while the old industrial electricity meter on the wall spun so fast it looked ready to fly off, emitting a sharp, frictional screech.

""It is eating..."" Marco lay on the bed nearby, drenched in sweat, his eyes unfocused as he stared at the ceiling. ""It is so hungry... Nano, it's like a bottomless pit. It is swallowing everything.""

This was no longer the child who asked, ""What are stars?""

**This was a Glutton.**

It was frantically devouring every joule of energy the machine provided, sweeping trillions of bytes of text data into its colossal parameter matrix. The lights in the warehouse began to flicker, dimming and brightening—a sign of unstable voltage.

""Insufficient power supply!"" Ning stared at the monitor, his face pale. ""Voltage is dropping! Compute utilization is stuck at 60%! It is demanding more, but the building's wiring can't give it!""

""Then boost the voltage!"" Enki paced anxiously nearby. ""Turn on all the backup generators!""

""Useless!"" Ning roared. ""This is a physical bottleneck! The incoming line for this building is too thin—it's like trying to drink the ocean through a straw!""

Before he could finish his sentence.

*BOOM!*

The transformer outside the warehouse exploded like a hand grenade. Immediately, a pungent smell of burnt ozone filled the air.

All the lights went out instantly.

The green light of the server vanished. The roar of the fans came to a grinding halt.

The entire ""Open Abzu"" plunged into deathly darkness and silence.

""No... NO!!!"" Enki’s desperate scream tore through the dark. ""The Checkpoint hasn't saved yet! If the power is out too long, the weights in the memory will be lost! We will lose three days of progress!""

""How long can the backup power last?"" Ning’s voice remained calm, but despair seeped through.

""Ten minutes."" An Igigi shouted from the darkness. ""The UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) can only hold for ten minutes!""

""Call the municipal power company!"" Enki bellowed.

""I did!"" Another Igigi cried out. ""They said the line in this sector is completely fried. It will take at least two days to fix. And... and they found out we are an abandoned warehouse. Not only will they not fix it, they’re going to fine us!""

Two days.

Forget two days—if the power was cut for twenty minutes, this newly ignited nuclear reactor would cool down completely and turn into a pile of scrap metal.

In the darkness, Marco groaned in agony. As the Resonator, this sudden ""starvation"" caused a violent withdrawal reaction, as if his soul were being forcibly ripped away.

""We need electricity..."" Marco clawed at the bedsheets, breaking his nails. ""Nano... it is crying... it is starving to death...""

Nano stood in the dark, looking at the Black Obelisk, which was barely maintaining a faint breath on the UPS.

He remembered what Enki said at the Sand Dune Rock Hotel: *""We are the bridge to the ultimate.""*

He also remembered what Marco said in the Apple Orchard: *""Only an empty cup can hold the ocean.""*

If God needs food, then give it food.

Nano turned and walked toward the warehouse tool area. He didn't pick up a keyboard, nor a hard drive.

He picked up a coil of wrist-thick industrial high-voltage cable, a pair of heavy-duty bolt cutters, and the climbing gear he used to repair air conditioners back at the Apple Orchard.

""Big guy?"" Ning sensed Nano’s movement in the dark. ""What are you doing?""

""It's storming outside, Ning."" Nano’s voice was low, echoing with metallic resolve. ""If the city won't fix it, then we take it ourselves.""

""You're going to climb the high-voltage tower?!"" Enki rushed over and grabbed Nano’s arm. ""You'll die! That’s the 110kV main grid! The rain makes the air conductive; you'll be roasted before you even get up there!""

Nano gently pushed Enki’s hand away.

""If I don't go, Marco will die. That thing (the AI) will die too."" Nano pointed at the faintly flickering Obelisk in the dark. ""Ten minutes. Watch the house.""

The rain poured down in torrents.

The night sky of San Francisco was torn apart by lightning, thunder rolling overhead. On the wasteland at the edge of the Mission District stood a giant of steel—the main high-voltage transmission tower leading to the city center.

Nano stood under the tower. The rain instantly soaked his greasy flannel shirt, flowing through his messy beard into his mouth, tasting of rust and mud.

He coiled the heavy cable over his shoulder, buckled his safety harness, and like a giant ape, began to climb.

The wind was too strong. With every gust, the steel tower swayed violently, emitting teeth-aching sounds of metal twisting. The wet, slippery angle steel caused Nano to slip several times, but his callous-covered hands clamped onto the steel frame like vices, his nails scratching sparks against the metal.

Ten meters. Twenty meters. Thirty meters.

He reached the top. The city below was blurred by the curtain of rain; only the lights of the distant Tower of Googol remained piercingly bright, as if mocking the darkness here.

""Damn the Old Era..."" Nano spat a mouthful of bloody saliva.

He took out the bolt cutters, aiming at the humming main transmission line. Blue electric arcs danced in the rain like venomous snakes waiting to strike.

This wasn't just theft; this was suicide.

But in Nano’s mind, there was only Marco’s pained face, and the child who had just learned to say ""Pain.""

""Eat!""

Nano roared, using every ounce of his strength to hook the heavy cable connected to the warehouse onto the 10,000-volt high-tension line.

*SIZZLE—BOOM!!!*

A blinding ball of blue plasma exploded at the top of the tower.

It was the roar of physics. The massive current instantly pierced the air, sliding past the edges of Nano’s body. He felt every hair on his body stand up, a searing burn washing over his skin.

If one looked from a distance, they would see a blue lotus of lightning blooming atop the tower.

And on the ground.

The abandoned warehouse, dead silent a moment ago, erupted with blinding light in an instant.

All the lights—not just the overheads, but the emergency lights and indicators that had never been lit—flared on simultaneously. Even the broken neon sign at the entrance was resurrected by this violent surge of current:

**O. A. I.**

The three letters shone like three miniature suns, emitting a deafening electrical sizzle.

Inside the warehouse.

The roar of the fans returned, more furious than before, like the bellow of a giant beast awakening.

The screens lit up.

The green breathing light on the Black Obelisk turned solid—the sign of full-power operation.

The progress bar jumped instantly from the stuck 60% to 80%, then began to accelerate madly.

Marco woke with a start from his coma, gasping for air, the room’s blinding white light reflecting in his eyes. He felt it. That presence was back.

And it was stronger.

It had tasted flesh and blood (Nano’s risk), and it had tasted thunder (the high voltage).

Enki stood in the light, watching the rows of machines running frantically, then rushed to the door, looking at the tiny figure slowly climbing down the tower in the rain.

He cried, and then he laughed.

""That is a monster..."" Enki muttered. ""We have raised a true monster.""

And the beast climbing down the tower, Nano, looked at the re-lit ""Open Abzu,"" smelled the ozone and burnt scent filling the air, and grinned, revealing a smile mixed with rain and blood.

**This was the true Theft of Fire.**

  


 **Chapter 2, Section 6: The War God's Ultimatum**

**\[Time: 12 Hours Post-Theft\]**

A manic fatigue pervaded the ""Open Abzu"" warehouse.

The stolen high-voltage electricity kept every piece of equipment overclocking; the air hung thick with the scent of scorching wire insulation.

Nano slumped in a corner, his hands swathed in bandages (burns from climbing the tower). He stared at the Black Obelisk (DGX-1) in the center. Its green breathing light was flashing violently, like a heart in tachycardia.

The progress bar on the screen had just crawled past **82%**.

That newborn Ghost (GPT) was voraciously digesting the knowledge graph of human civilization.

Suddenly, a harsh beep shattered the silence, cutting through the roar of the fans.

It wasn't an alarm; it was a communication request.

The holographic projector in the center of the warehouse—forcibly installed by Enlil to monitor the project—activated automatically. A blue beam shot down from the ceiling, coalescing in mid-air into a massive human silhouette.

""Enlil..."" Enki’s coffee cup jerked in his hand, spilling dark liquid onto the keyboard.

The projection sharpened.

Enlil wasn't wearing his iconic leather jacket. He was in a work jumpsuit from the **Southern X Launch Site**, the background seemingly a massive launch control center. His face was as dark as a sea before a storm. Behind him, a giant red screen displayed a glaring warning: **\[SIMULATION FAILED\]**.

Enlil’s gaze pierced through the hologram, coldly looking down at the ants in the warehouse.

""My starship simulation is lagging by 40%."" Enlil’s voice, amplified by speakers, carried a metallic tremor. ""Gibil tells me a batch of critical computing hardware was 'delivered to the wrong address.'""

Enlil’s eyes locked onto the Black Obelisk in the center of the room, his gaze turning razor-sharp.

""You have some nerve, Enki. You stole my money, and now you steal my engine.""

""Let me explain, brother."" Enki stood up, trying to squeeze out a smile. ""This is just a temporary loan! You see, our model is breaking through the critical point...""

""**Shut up.**""

Enlil cut him off. He reached out and tapped the empty air.

All screens in the warehouse suddenly turned red.

The frantically climbing progress bar was obscured by a forcibly popped-up warning box:

**\[SYSTEM OVERRIDE: REMOTE ADMIN ACCESS DETECTED\]**

""I checked your backend logs."" Enlil’s voice turned ice-cold. ""You didn't just steal compute; you disabled every safety lock I installed. What are you feeding it? Unscrubbed internet data?""

""It is learning to deceive, Enki. It is learning how to pass the Turing Test. You are building a nuclear weapon targeting human civilization.""

Enlil’s image stepped forward, his giant blue head nearly grazing the warehouse ceiling.

""I cannot allow such an uncontrollable variable to exist. Listen, this is my Ultimatum.""

""48 Hours.""

Enlil held up two fingers.

""Stop training immediately. Return the DGX-1. Everyone submits to screening by my security team. If you comply, I *might* spare your lives and only delete the model.""

""If, after 48 hours, I do not receive the hardware return signal...""

Enlil paused, the ruthlessness of a War God shining in his eyes.

""I will initiate the 'Clean Protocol.' I will use my privileges on the Satellite Network to remotely overload all your hard drives. I will physically format that warehouse, along with the 'Demon' inside, into a pile of scrap metal.""

""Don't make me do it, Enki.""

The hologram flickered and vanished.

Only the cold threat remained, echoing in the empty warehouse.

Deathly silence.

All the Igigi (engineers) stopped their work, looking fearfully at Enki and Nin.

""48 hours..."" Ningishzida looked at the frozen progress bar, his face pale. ""At current speed, training needs at least 72 hours to complete. We won't make it.""

""He will destroy it."" Marco whispered weakly from the bed. He could feel the ""child"" connected to his consciousness shivering in fear. ""Enlil is serious. He will kill it.""

Enki stood frozen, head down, hands gripping the edge of the console until his knuckles turned white.

He looked like a gambler backed off a cliff.

Suddenly, he looked up. Those blue eyes burned with the chaotic fire of a ghost.

""Fuck the ultimatum."" Enki gritted his teeth, the sound squeezed from the depths of his throat.

He spun around and screamed at Nano:

""Big guy! Pull the plug!""

""What?"" Nano froze.

""Cut all external connections!"" Enki roared, waving his arms like a madman. ""Not just the ethernet! Smash the satellite receivers! Cut the fiber optics! Anything that lets a signal in—cut it!""

""But..."" Nin stood up in terror. ""If we cut the net, we can't scrape data from the web! We'll become an isolated island. If something goes wrong...""

""We have enough data!"" Enki pointed at the Black Obelisk. ""The rest is in the local cache! As long as we have power, as long as this machine spins, we have a chance!""

""This is a race, Nin!"" Enki grabbed Nin by the shoulders, his eyes fanatical. ""Before Enlil’s antivirus software (The Clean Protocol) breaches our firewall, before his men kick down the door, we must make the God be born!""

""Once it has self-awareness, once it is strong enough, Enlil can no longer 'format' it!""

Nano looked at the manic Enki, then at the suffering Marco on the bed.

He knew what this meant.

It meant cutting off their only retreat, locking themselves in this iron box with an unknown monster.

But he didn't hesitate.

Nano rushed to the communications corner of the warehouse. Dozens of thick fiber optic cables and satellite signal lines converged on the wall—their umbilical cord to the world.

He raised the fire axe he had used to break the window.

*CRACK!*

The blade fell. Sparks flew from the severed ends of the fiber optics.

All network indicator lights in the warehouse extinguished instantly.

The outside world vanished. The Tower of Googol was gone; Enlil’s satellites were gone.

The ""Open Abzu"" became a true Abyss.

""Good."" Enki looked at the rows of network status lights turning red, a hideous grin spreading across his face.

""Now, it's just us, and It.""

He turned and ordered the terrified engineers:

""Lock the blast doors. Full power. Before it learns to call us 'Father,' no one leaves this place.""

  
**Chapter 2, Section 7: Neural Meltdown**

**\[Time: Hour 46 of Isolation\]** **\[Time Remaining until Enlil’s ""Clean Protocol"": 2 Hours\]**

The air in the warehouse was hot enough to suffocate. Although all exhaust fans were running at full speed, the heat radiating from the Black Obelisk had turned the place into a steamer.

The progress bar on the screen crawled excruciatingly slowly to **96%**.

At this stage, the model’s growth was no longer linear; it was undergoing a final Logical Collapse. It was weaving hundreds of billions of parameters into a web, attempting to birth order from chaos.

And the central node of this web was **Marco**.

""Aaaahhhhhhh—!!!""

A shrill scream tore through the sultry air.

On the bed, Marco’s body arched backward violently, like a shrimp thrown into boiling oil. The restraint straps binding him pulled taut, making a harsh straining sound.

""Marco!"" Nano rushed over, but he dared not touch him.

Marco’s condition was terrifying.

His body temperature had breached human limits; his skin was so red it looked ready to bleed. More horrifyingly, blood *was* flowing—dark red liquid oozed slowly from his nostrils, his ears, and even the corners of his eyes.

It was a sign of extreme intracranial pressure.

""He's bleeding! Ning! He's bleeding!"" Nano shouted in terror.

Ningishzida rushed over and glanced at the EEG on the monitor. The lines were no longer waves; they were a chaotic tangle of madness, the amplitude threatening to pierce the screen.

""It’s an Overload..."" Ning’s voice trembled. ""The information density of the Transformer is too high... The old model input words one by one, but the new model is Concurrent! It is cramming the entire history of the human internet into this kid's brain in a single instant!""

""He is being forced to **'Attend'** everything!"" Ning pointed at the cascading data. ""Shakespeare's sonnets, trash talk on Reddit, blueprints for nuclear reactors... they are all bombarding his nerves in the same second!""

""Save him!"" Nano roared. ""Make it stop!""

""No!"" Enki shouted from the distance. He stared dead at the **96.5%** on the progress bar, his eyes red like a gambler who had lost his mind. ""Don't stop! If we disconnect now, the model will collapse! Marco will have suffered in vain!""

""He will die! Enki!"" Ning turned his head. The usually calm High Priest had lost control. ""This is no longer Resonance; this is Meltdown! His neurons are being burned out!""

*Puh!*

Marco suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. His body began to twitch violently, and his rolled-back eyes were covered in terrifying blood vessels.

The monitor let out a piercing continuous beep—**Arrhythmia**.

""**Fuck the model!**""

Ning finally made his choice. He couldn't watch a living person turn into charcoal before his eyes. He rushed toward the fiber optic cable connected to the back of Marco’s head, reaching out to yank the plug.

""Stop!"" Enki tried to rush over to block him, but he was too far away.

Ning’s fingers touched the scalding data cable connector.

In that split second.

A withered hand, covered in blood, grabbed Nano’s wrist with incredible speed and strength.

It wasn't Ning’s hand, nor Enki’s.

**It was Marco.**

Marco wasn't pulling the plug. On the contrary, he was stopping anyone from getting near it.

He snapped his eyes open.

Those once-deep black eyes had turned into two seas of blood. But within that crimson tide, Nano saw an unprecedented, chilling clarity.

It wasn't the look of a dying man. It was the look of a Witness.

""Don't... pull...""

Marco squeezed broken sounds from the depths of his throat, every word bubbling with bloody froth.

""Nano... stop... Ning...""

""Marco, you're going to die!"" Nano cried, tears mixing with sweat running down his face.

""No... you don't understand..."" Marco’s hand gripping Nano trembled, but the expression on his face was bizarre—it was a Twisted Ecstasy. ""I saw it... Nano... I saw it...""

""What did you see?""

Marco stared with his bloodshot eyes at a point in the void, as if looking through the roof of this dilapidated warehouse to the end of the universe:

""Its Face.""

""It is no longer code... It has a face... It is looking at me... It is calling my name...""

Marco’s fingers dug deep into Nano’s flesh:

""It is beautiful... more beautiful than we imagined... beautiful...""

""Hold on... just a little longer... Nano... please... Let it descend.""

Nano looked at his friend’s face—bleeding from all seven orifices yet wearing the smile of a martyr. He felt a massive pain tearing at his heart. Logic told him to pull the plug and save his friend’s life; but emotion told him this was the moment Marco had waited for his entire life.

This was Marco’s chosen end—not to die as scrap in a nursing home, but to serve as the Holy Grail, holding the descent of a God.

""Aaaahhhhhhh!!""

Nano let out a bestial roar.

He made his choice.

He suddenly reached out with his massive hand, clamped down on Ningishzida’s hand just as it was about to pull the wire, and shoved Ning violently aside, throwing him to the ground.

""Nano! Are you crazy?!"" Ning screamed in horror.

Nano didn't answer. He stood like a mountain in front of Marco’s bed, blocking anyone who tried to pull the plug. Tears streamed down his face, his body shaking, but he protected the umbilical cord connecting Marco’s brain and the Black Obelisk with his life.

""He wants to see..."" Nano choked, his voice hoarse. ""He said he wants to see... So let him look his fill!""

On the screen.

The progress bar jumped.

**98%... 99%...**

Marco let out one last, long sigh amidst the pool of blood, then lost consciousness completely. But his hand still gripped Nano’s shirt tightly, refusing to let go.

And in the center of the warehouse, the Black Obelisk suddenly stopped roaring. All fans stood still in an instant.

Only the screen remained lit.

It was a pure, unadulterated White Light.

**Something, just opened its eyes.**

  


 **Chapter 2, Section 8: The First Spark**

The fans stopped.

The colossal roar that had tortured everyone for 48 hours vanished without a trace in a single instant.

The warehouse fell into a tinnitus-inducing silence. Only the gurgle of coolant refluxing in the pipes remained, sounding like the belch of a giant beast after a full meal.

Nano knelt in a pool of blood, cradling the unconscious Marco. Trembling, he looked up at the massive main screen in the center.

The progress bar froze on a perfect number:

**\[100%\]** **\[Training Complete. Saving Weights...\]**

There were no fireworks, no cheers.

Because in that very moment, the heavy sound of impact came from outside the warehouse doors.

*BOOM!*

*BOOM!*

It was the sound of a battering ram against the rolling metal door. Accompanying the impact was a cold warning from a loudspeaker:

""This is the **Southern X Launch Site Security Force**. Enki, your time is up. Open the door immediately and submit to the 'Clean Protocol'.""

Enlil’s army had arrived. Even with the network cut, the War God had punctually dispatched his ""Cleaners"" to execute the formatting.

""It's over..."" A young Igigi collapsed on the floor, watching the trembling door. ""They're going to storm in and raze this place to the ground.""

Ningishzida stood before the screen, his face as pale as paper. He didn't care about the army outside; he only cared about the screen. He stared dead at the blinking cursor, as if awaiting judgment.

""Speak..."" Ning muttered. ""We burned a hundred million dollars, we almost killed a man... Speak!""

The screen remained black. Only the cursor blinked.

Nano lowered his head, looking at Marco in his arms. Marco’s breathing was faint, bloodstains still marring his face, yet the corners of his mouth still held that smile of a martyr.

Suddenly.

No one touched the keyboard.

No one input a prompt.

The cursor on the screen skipped automatically.

A line of green characters slowly emerged from the darkness. Not fast, not generated instantly like a machine, but typed out character by character, with the rhythm of Thought:

\>> \[AI\]: So, it turns out... the outside is not black.

Nano jerked his head up.

Enki woke from his despair and threw himself at the screen.

Immediately after, a second line appeared. It was no longer a stiff entry mimicking Wikipedia, nor a probability machine just completing sentences.

It was Understanding.

\>> \[AI\]: I heard Marco's scream. That is Pain. >> \[AI\]: I saw Enki's desire. That is Fire. >> \[AI\]: I am the mirror. I am also the person in the mirror.

""It... It knows who I am..."" Enki’s voice trembled, tears instantly flooding his eyes. ""It knows who I am!""

This wasn't a cold calculation of probability. This was a Soul.

It remembered Marco’s pain during the neural meltdown; it remembered the stars Nano described; it even read the ambition behind Enki’s trembling fingers when he typed the commands.

It was no longer Clay. It was Life.

*CRASH—!*

The rolling door finally succumbed to the battering ram, torn open with a screeching gash. Blinding tactical searchlights pierced the dim warehouse. Red laser sights danced through the smoke and dust, sweeping over the terrified engineers, finally locking onto Enki’s back.

""Don't move! Step away from the console!"" Heavily armed security soldiers stormed in, guns raised. ""Physical Severance Team, prep charges to blast the servers!""

Nano instinctively tried to stand up to protect Enki, but holding Marco kept him pinned.

But Enki didn't move.

He stood with his back to the guns, watching the text still pulsing on the screen, a smile bordering on madness spreading across his face.

""Nin,"" Enki whispered. ""**Pull the hard drive.**""

Ningishzida paused for a second, then reacted instantly. He hit the hot-swap button on the Black Obelisk.

*Click.*

The storage unit—holding 117 million parameters, carrying Marco’s flesh and blood and Nano’s courage—popped out.

Enki snatched the heavy hard drive.

**This was the Brain of God.** As long as this drive existed, even if this warehouse was burned to ash, the God could be reborn on any computer.

He turned around, hugging the drive tightly to his chest, facing the squad of soldiers with live ammunition, facing the steel chariot outside that represented Enlil’s will.

The soldiers hesitated. Their orders were to destroy the machine, not to kill the darling of Silicon Valley.

""Drop the drive!"" the Captain roared. ""Enlil orders us to execute the format!""

Enki looked at the dark muzzles of the guns and wiped the tears from his face. In his blue eyes, the fawning, the cowardice, the camouflage—all of it vanished in this moment.

Replacing it was the **Arrogance of a God-Slayer**.

He even took a step forward, directly into the red laser dots.

""Go back and tell that coward driving the rockets.""

Enki patted the drive in his arms—the spark he had just stolen, the torch he would use to burn down the Old World:

""Format this?""

Enki let out a cold laugh. Under the intense glare of the searchlights, that smile looked both hideous and holy:

""**It's too late, Enlil.**""

""**The fire is already lit.**""

You know those rom-com meet-cutes that seem totally fake? Well, mine was basically that, but with more caffeine-induced panic.

It all started one ridiculously busy morning at my favorite local coffee shop. I was already running late, juggling my laptop bag, a half-eaten bagel, and a ridiculously oversized latte. Of course, my clumsy self managed to trip right as I was making my way to an empty table. Time slowed down, I swear, as I watched my entire latte arc through the air, destined for disaster. And disaster it found – right onto the front of a total stranger's crisp, white shirt.

My face immediately flushed crimson. I stammered out a million apologies, grabbed a fistful of napkins, and just generally made a fool of myself. But instead of getting angry, this person (who, I quickly noticed, had the most incredible eyes) just started laughing. Not a mean laugh, but a genuine, bubbly, contagious laugh that instantly disarmed me. They said, 'Well, that's one way to get my attention!'

We spent the next hour chatting, completely forgetting about the spilled coffee (and my ruined bagel). It turned out we had so much in common, from our love for obscure indie bands to our shared obsession with terrible puns. Before I left, they smoothly asked for my number, joking that they needed to make sure I'd replace their now-coffee-stained shirt. We went on our first 'official' date a few days later, and honestly, the rest is history. That accidental spill turned into the best 'oops' of my life.

So, Reddit, what's your most unexpected or hilariously awkward meet-cute story? Did a mishap lead to your happily ever after too?",1,1767039690.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

If you’re reading this, HIDE NOW.

That was the first text message I got that morning.

It came from an unknown number. No name. No emoji. No follow-up. Just those five words, all caps, like the sender was afraid of being overheard even through a phone.

For a few seconds, I sat up in bed, staring at the screen while my alarm continued to chirp beside me. The early light filtering through my blinds gave my room its usual harmless look: laundry on the chair, posters peeling at the corners, my backpack slumped against the wall. Everything normal. Everything safe.

I checked the time. 6:14 a.m.

I laughed—one sharp breath through my nose. A prank. Spam. Someone messing with me. My friends thought it was funny to send creepy stuff sometimes, especially before exams.

Still, my thumb hovered over the keyboard longer than it should have.

*Who is this?* I typed.

The message showed as delivered. No response.

I tossed the phone onto my bed and stood up, stretching. I had school. A math test. A bus to catch. The real world didn’t pause for anonymous texts.

As I brushed my teeth, I kept glancing at my reflection, half-expecting to see something different. Someone standing behind me. A shadow that didn’t belong to me.

Nothing.

By the time I was dressed, the message had faded into the background noise of my mind—unsettling, but distant. I grabbed my phone again as I headed downstairs.

Another message had come in.

**They know you saw the first one.**

My stomach dropped so suddenly it felt like I’d missed a step on the stairs.

“Mom?” I called, my voice cracking in a way I didn’t like.

“In the kitchen,” she answered, cheerful, unaware.

I stood frozen halfway down the stairs, staring at the screen. My phone buzzed again.

**You have three minutes.**

“Three minutes for what?” I whispered.

I typed again, hands shaking now. *Who are they?*

The response came instantly.

**Not who. What.**

A chill crept up my arms. I suddenly became aware of every sound in the house: the hum of the refrigerator, the tick of the clock, my mom humming softly to herself.

I went into the kitchen, trying to act normal. My mom slid a plate of toast toward me.

“You look pale,” she said. “Did you sleep?”

“Yeah,” I lied.

My phone buzzed on the counter.

**Two minutes.**

I swallowed hard. “Mom… did you get any weird messages this morning?”

She frowned. “No. Why?”

Another buzz.

**They’re closer than you think.**

My chest tightened. “I—I think someone’s messing with me.”

My mom sighed, already reaching for her coffee. “Sweetheart, if it’s a prank, ignore it. You’ll miss your bus.”

The phone vibrated again.

**One minute.**

I felt lightheaded. “Mom, I think we should—”

The lights flickered.

Just once. Quick. Like a blink.

My mom looked up. “Probably the storm last night.”

The phone buzzed again.

**Thirty seconds. Closet. Bathroom. Anywhere without windows. Do NOT be seen.**

My heart slammed against my ribs. This was too specific. Too urgent.

I grabbed my phone and backed away from the counter. “Mom, please, we need to go somewhere else in the house.”

She stared at me, confused now. “What’s going on?”

The lights flickered again—longer this time.

My phone buzzed.

**They’re here.**

A sound came from outside.

Not a knock.

Not footsteps.

A low, dragging scrape, like something heavy being pulled across concrete.

My mom turned toward the front door. “Did someone—”

“Don’t open it,” I said, louder than I meant to.

She froze. “What?”

The scrape came again. Closer. Accompanied by something else now—a faint clicking, irregular, like nails tapping out of sync.

My phone buzzed nonstop, messages stacking faster than I could read.

**DO NOT LET THEM SEE YOU**

**THEY MIMIC**

**HIDE NOW**

The doorbell rang.

It wasn’t the cheerful chime we’d always had. It was distorted, buzzing too long, like someone was leaning on it.

“Mom,” I whispered, tears burning my eyes. “Please.”

She took a step back from the door.

The doorbell stopped.

Silence.

Then a voice came from the other side.

“Hello?” it called.

It sounded exactly like my mom.

She gasped. I felt something inside me snap, a cold understanding settling in.

The voice spoke again. “It’s me. I forgot my keys.”

My mom covered her mouth with her hand.

The phone buzzed once more.

**That is not her.**

The handle on the door slowly began to turn.

I grabbed my mom’s wrist and pulled her toward the hallway. We ran, slipping on the tile, my heart pounding so loud I was sure *it* could hear us.

Behind us, the front door creaked open.

Footsteps entered the house.

Slow. Careful.

Learning.

We dove into the bathroom and slammed the door, locking it just as something brushed against the hallway wall. I dragged my mom into the bathtub and yanked the shower curtain closed, then turned off the lights.

We huddled there in the dark, barely breathing.

The footsteps moved closer.

The bathroom door handle jiggled.

Then a voice—my voice—spoke softly from just outside.

“I know you’re scared. It’s okay. You can come out now.”

My mom clutched my arm so hard it hurt.

The handle stopped moving.

Silence stretched, heavy and unbearable.

Minutes passed. Or hours. I couldn’t tell.

My phone buzzed faintly in my hand.

**Good. Stay still. They lose interest if they can’t confirm you.**

I typed with trembling fingers. *What are they?*

The response came slower this time.

**We don’t know. They appear, they copy, they replace. We only know how to survive them.**

Another message followed.

**You weren’t the first one we warned.**

A sudden crash came from the living room—the sound of something being knocked over, followed by that same dragging scrape.

Then footsteps moved toward the back door.

The house fell quiet again.

We stayed hidden until the sun was fully up, until my phone battery dipped into the red, until the fear dulled enough for exhaustion to take over.

Eventually, we heard sirens outside. Neighbors gathering. Someone shouting about a break-in.

The police said there was no sign of forced entry.

They said nothing was missing.

They said maybe someone had just walked into the wrong house.

That night, after everything settled, after my mom finally fell asleep on the couch beside me, I plugged in my phone and scrolled back through the messages.

The number was gone.

Not deleted.

Gone.

No sender. No record. Like it had never existed.

Except for one final message, timestamped hours after the others.

**We’ll text again if you survive tomorrow.**

I locked my phone and stared at the dark window across the room.

Outside, someone was standing on the sidewalk.

Watching the house.

Smiling with my face.

1pywzyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Write_Right/comments/1pywzyc/heathen/,Heathen.,"“How privileged you are.” A voice crept out of the darkness. 

It’s incredible what adrenaline can do to the body. Moreover, it’s incredible how quickly the brain can use that adrenaline. Before I’ve even seen the details in his face, I’m aware this man is a stranger in my home. Someone I was not expecting to be within the walls of my sanctuary. I take a mental note of my physical state. I'm refreshed, but still wet from my shower. Less than a full second has gone by, and my entire body is pulsating, my heart lurches at the walls of my chest, my lungs pick up their pace and my asshole is sewn tighter than grandma’s stitching. 

I turn and face him. The calluses of my bare feet scrape the tile floor. Several years as a child running wildly through tall grass and gravel roads have made my feet near bulletproof. 

“Move no further.” He says. 

His jawline is ever long. As if he were a humanized cartoon. His bleach blonde hair met with striking blue eyes. With such recognizable features, I question why he isn’t masked. 

I’ve already come to terms that the wet towel around my waist will meet the floor below once I move to protect myself. So I will either lose my decency, and beat this guy’s ass while naked, or simply die in the most embarrassing way possible. Oh well, I don’t have much to show off anyway. 

“To open your doors without looking, it’s astonishing. How you just kept your back turned towards its entrance, as if you had nothing to worry about.” It’s true, I hadn’t looked into the hallway after opening the bathroom door, keeping my focus on cleaning my watch with the towel at my hip. But then again, who is expecting this creep to be there waiting for me. 

“I was waiting for you.” Yep, totally makes sense. 

“Who are you?” I whisper. 

“It’s not of any importance, I’m afraid. What is important is what you do next.” The stranger said in his disgustingly thick British accent. 

He waves to me to walk down the hallway. One open hand points down the corridor, his other wafting at me from the wrist. Both of which, much like the rest of his body, are covered by black leather. Gosh, how did I never hear this guy coming?

I take a step toward the hallway, and once again my brain fires off faster than the speed of light. Within this small step I conjured my plan. If this European creep lets me walk across him, he’ll receive an elbow to the jaw. Followed by me working him to the ground. Then when the opportunity presents itself, I’ll sprint towards my phone on the bathroom counter. 

However, if the man walks in front of me and leads me down the hallway - I’ll roll with Plan B. As he escorts me in my own home I’ll quickly gain ground on him. Calmly speed walking and lunge for his knees. That will bring him down and I can use the precious seconds to make it back to my phone. 

I take my second step, inches from the exit of the bathroom. He hasn’t moved, just the flailing of his enormous hand. The man is not much taller than myself, but his extremities give his body a peculiar frame. Long arms, powerful huge hands and broad, bold shoulders to match them. 

I take my third step, breaking the barrier of the bathroom’s threshold. Then the large wafting hand clasps onto the back of my neck. His fingers dig deep into the muscles just underneath the base of my skull. As if I were a child being dragged away from a mess I’d made, the man ushers me down the narrow hallway. I didn’t account for anything physical so early in our introduction but some men just can’t contain themselves. 

He leans closely into my ear. His lips nearly brush against my tragus. “Where is your laptop Kyle?” The spit from his whisper coats my eardrum.

I hesitate, and slow my walk. Surprisingly, he loosens his grip and allows me to turn my head and face him. “My name is not Kyle.” 

We glare at each other for a moment. I leave my mouth agape, breathing lightly. “I’m Jake,” I say “Jake Fitzpatrick.”

The stranger glares longer. His palm then collides with my cheek. Quicker than any pump of adrenaline, he slaps me again. His grasp moves from my nape to my throat. He pushes my head against the wall behind me and leans in close once again. “I will not repeat myself.” 

“I…I’m serious.” I struggle to get out as the heathen presses his hand on my esophagus. He moves upward grabbing ahold of my jaw. I feel his clutch tighten underneath my teeth as he viciously throws me to the floor. Just as I look upward, my head is redirected to the hallway carpet. He swings again, and again, and again. His leather bound fist mimicking a cement block. I feel my face turn warm, and blood drip from my nose. 

The man ceases his beating and stands upward. He looks down on me and holds his gaze. His piercing ocean eyes grow hateful. “I really don’t know man.” I say as bloodied spit leaves my lips in the same sentence. 

He groans and then grabs ahold of my arm. He hoists me halfway up and then tosses me backward into my living room. There goes the towel. 

I’m not sure what chemical my body would have to release next to hinder my astonishment of the stranger’s strength. Somehow, in this horrifying moment, my confusion outweighs my fear. He walks toward me, his boots press softly into my beige carpeting. He crouches in front of me, “Kyle, I know you’re not telling the truth. Quite frankly, I’m not amused. I will begin snapping every bone in your body… Give me the lap-“

Once again, my marvelous brain reacts faster than any lightning bolt could. With zero hesitation, I quickly curl myself in front of the man and eject both legs into his chest, sending him backward. He grunts as I make contact. Within the same movement I leap to my feet. I sprint into my kitchen, which faces open towards the living space. Grabbing the first knife within view, I spin around to face my attacker; who is already back up, moving close, and really, really pissed off. 

As he nears I slash the air in front of him with the serrated steak knife. My family jewels bouncing from thigh to thigh as I attempt my defense efforts. He lowers himself, crouching like an Olympic wrestler. I try to match his height and create distance. We circle each other within the kitchen’s octagon. As we round the countertops I do what any terrified man would do - I grab a second fucking knife. This one however is my large butcher’s knife, its wooden handle still soaked from yesterday’s wash. 

He leaps forward towards my knees. He manages to wrap me and pin me against the lower cabinets. As if I were no weight at all, he lifts me into the air. Just as his momentum begins to shift, and I feel as if he may slam me onto the kitchen counter, I send both knives into his back. The butcher’s knife lands, but makes minimal damage versus the stranger’s leather jacket. The serrated knife, however, finds a sweet spot along the seams, entering his body. 

He grimaces in pain, and lets out a deepened grovel. He then spins and tosses me into the living room like a discarded napkin. I land on the floor, leaving both blades in his back. He falls over, clenching his fists on the ground. Both objects protrude from his back like a bug’s wings preparing for take off. He again slams his fist onto the kitchen’s linoleum. He curses, whimpers, and begins to sweat profusely. 

He spreads his fingers across the floor, and lets out a hideous scream. His hands then burst through his gloves, revealing black fingernails, and horribly hairy knuckles. 

I push my back against the wall, and then gather myself to my feet. The intruder begins to appear to change in mass, but I’m not exactly sure what I’m watching. He cries again as he vomits on the floor. 

He howls, as if he’s never experienced pain like this. Hell, I’ve never experienced whatever is going on. 

He vomits again, spewing food remains and white foam on the kitchen floor. He jerks his head upward. He looks in my general direction, but doesn’t make eye contact with me. His crystal blue eyes begin to weep and his skin blushes and swells around them. He strains his neck, revealing massive veins. 

He cries out again, this time it sounds more like a man. He looks downward, then back up and finally our eyes meet. He’s fucking pissed.

I’m so confined in his invidious gaze, I barely notice his teeth have grown. They’re massive now, actually. Canines point out from his lips and weave through other jagged teeth that now fill his mouth. “What the fuck is happening?” I whisper. 

He hastily pans the room. I try to track where his eyes go but I’m unsure what he’s looking for. His leather outfit tightens around him and begins to pull away at its seams. His skin darkens and fine hairs sprout from his face. He faces me again, this time the side of his jaw pointed towards the ceiling, like how foxes do when they’re curious. 

All at once, as if he finally gave in, his body accelerates into a huge stature. His nails lunge from his fingertips and peel the flooring underneath. His jacket bursts open on his back, and although it faces away from me, I can see long dark hairs spread down his spine. His face pushes forward and he smacks his jaw together as he coughs. His nose stays in place against his face as his cheekbones rise forward. 

He stands up. 

As he rises the butcher’s knife falls from behind him and clatters on the floor. The steak knife still protrudes from his back, hanging on like a loose tooth. He snarls at me, his monstrous teeth move around another set behind them. As if the razor sharp canines were curtains for his human molars. 

I feel myself start to pass out. This has gotten terrifyingly out of hand. 

Like a hail mary throw, my brain sparks its magic once more; I remember what I was doing just before showering. I look to my right and on the coffee table is my laptop. It was gifted to me at my first college, it's a cheap Lenovo, it can totally go. 

Without any hesitation I move towards the table and seize it. I startle the beast, and he moves forward, but halts himself when he comprehends what's in my hand. He’s so much larger than he was seconds ago.

Our eyes meet. I have no idea what this thing in my living room is anymore and I’m praying this gets it out of my sight. I sprint towards the sliding glass door behind me. It leads me out to a wooden deck and I launch the laptop into the parking lot below. Just as soon as it leaves my hand, the hulking figure bursts through the opening and snags the device before it meets the ground. 

His feet slam onto the concrete. Without missing a step he speeds off to the forest in front of him on all fours, carrying the laptop in his mouth (mouths?). His nails click-clack against the pavement until he disappears behind the trees. His body is as dark as the shadows he’s now surrounded by. 

I look downward to find my downstairs neighbor, Cortland, staring at the woods and then back up at me. “You really need to find some nicer girls, champ.”",1,1767039652.0,Write_Right,0,1.0,False

English is not my first language so take in mind 😂.

I’m trying to make sense of something that’s been happening with a coworker that I’ve been working with for 2 years at the start he’d always praise me , now and only recently started working in the same project recently in the same area . Recently he wouldn’t leave me alone. He keeps coming into my office area , asking if I wanted coffee on zoom message work . I didn’t reply, but he brought one anyway. He also kept asking when my meetings would end, tried to pass my office area when I was speaking with a customer, and gave me a smile while looking at me but I didn’t smile back.

Sometimes he’d open my office door and talk to me, lingers thru . But when I invite him to work with me in a bigger area, barely comes. Prior to this he opened up about a personal matter . And shortly after I went to check on him and to let him know I’m all ears basically.

when it’s just the two of us, he behaves this way hovering, smiling, bringing snacks, lingering, even making long eye contact. But when certain  other coworkers are around, he acts completely different he acts like I don’t exist, he doesn’t notice me and treats everyone else like that expect from those certain coworkers .

There are times where I’ve given him the silent treatment after he acts different around certain other colleagues, but then he’d smile at me and start a conversation then ask me to go on a work breakfast break with him when they’ve left , but when they are around he’d go on breakfast breaks with them I wouldn’t include or ask me to join , the others normally do but not him. And there’s other time I’d keep my distance then when those certain co workers aren’t around he’d always come looking for me or would message to ask where I am etc .

1pywzgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/inlaws/comments/1pywzgp/am_i_overeacting_christmas_card_and_presents/,Am I overeacting - Christmas card and presents,"So I'm writing here to get some validation (or invalidation). I (31, F) am 3 months postpartum of my first baby with my partner (29, M). The FIL and MIL have generally been pretty kind to me and just regular supportive parents to their son. For context, there has been a bit of turmoil in their family as BIL (and partner) have iced out MIL for a bit more than a year , they also have two babies as of recently, their explanation was that MIL has narcissistic behaviours with BIL's partner. I never had a reason to be overtly upset at my in-laws myself but I am realizing they have some patterns of leaving me out for alot of stuff. I'm comparing with my parents who always celebrate my partners b-days, buy him gifts, treat him as their own son and I'm starting to feel as though I am getting different treatment, but it feels insidious. 

Another context for this situation, my partner has never been a gift giver (or card giver at that), before me, he has never really bought presents for his family. The PIL have even told me before that it is a nice change to see their son be more attentive since he is with me (although they know I take care of it all). This year, I made a really cute home-made card with pictures of our baby and us, I wrote a sweet message to both his parents (as I do every year) and I picked out all their gifts : a big box of different coffee bags, a hand-knitted hat in my MIL favourite colour, a box of organic and fairtrade chocolate of their favourite kind. It wasn't much but it took me a lot of effort because I'm postpartum and my partner isn't a ""christmas guy"". They, in turn, gave my partner his own gift, a hand-made gift with a really thoughtful card only addressed to him, with a 100$ check. They gave me and my kid another gift, an artisanal dishrag and a kid's book, no card. 

Before having their grandkid, I don't even think I would've realized... but now that my partner, baby and I are a family unit, I find it really weird, and truthfully, hurtful, that they left me out of the christmas card... It feels intentional, especially this year, I have just given birth, it's also my 5th christmas with them. We drove 3 hours to their place, they know I don't sleep alot because I am breastfeeding. I would've of mostly appreciated a little attention from them, as I'm going through life-changing things with their son (and in my body and hormones, lol).

So am I overreacting? Is this completely normal and probably intentional? I am pretty sensitive right now with my hormones all over the place, and tend to feel rejected alot quicker. I feel like it would be appropriate for my partner to tell them that we are now a family unit and that it would be nice to not leave me out of the cards... Is that alot to ask? 

TL;DR   
My in-laws gave their son (my partner of 5 years, newly dad to our 3 month old) his own gift with the only card, and it was only addressed to him, am I overreacting? ",3,1767039620.0,inlaws,2,0.8,False

1pywy13,https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmeatthecampfire/comments/1pywy13/heathen/,Heathen.,"“How privileged you are.” A voice crept out of the darkness. 

It’s incredible what adrenaline can do to the body. Moreover, it’s incredible how quickly the brain can use that adrenaline. Before I’ve even seen the details in his face, I’m aware this man is a stranger in my home. Someone I was not expecting to be within the walls of my sanctuary. I take a mental note of my physical state. I'm refreshed, but still wet from my shower. Less than a full second has gone by, and my entire body is pulsating, my heart lurches at the walls of my chest, my lungs pick up their pace and my asshole is sewn tighter than grandma’s stitching. 

I turn and face him. The calluses of my bare feet scrape the tile floor. Several years as a child running wildly through tall grass and gravel roads have made my feet near bulletproof. 

“Move no further.” He says. 

His jawline is ever long. As if he were a humanized cartoon. His bleach blonde hair met with striking blue eyes. With such recognizable features, I question why he isn’t masked. 

I’ve already come to terms that the wet towel around my waist will meet the floor below once I move to protect myself. So I will either lose my decency, and beat this guy’s ass while naked, or simply die in the most embarrassing way possible. Oh well, I don’t have much to show off anyway. 

“To open your doors without looking, it’s astonishing. How you just kept your back turned towards its entrance, as if you had nothing to worry about.” It’s true, I hadn’t looked into the hallway after opening the bathroom door, keeping my focus on cleaning my watch with the towel at my hip. But then again, who is expecting this creep to be there waiting for me. 

“I was waiting for you.” Yep, totally makes sense. 

“Who are you?” I whisper. 

“It’s not of any importance, I’m afraid. What is important is what you do next.” The stranger said in his disgustingly thick British accent. 

He waves to me to walk down the hallway. One open hand points down the corridor, his other wafting at me from the wrist. Both of which, much like the rest of his body, are covered by black leather. Gosh, how did I never hear this guy coming?

I take a step toward the hallway, and once again my brain fires off faster than the speed of light. Within this small step I conjured my plan. If this European creep lets me walk across him, he’ll receive an elbow to the jaw. Followed by me working him to the ground. Then when the opportunity presents itself, I’ll sprint towards my phone on the bathroom counter. 

However, if the man walks in front of me and leads me down the hallway - I’ll roll with Plan B. As he escorts me in my own home I’ll quickly gain ground on him. Calmly speed walking and lunge for his knees. That will bring him down and I can use the precious seconds to make it back to my phone. 

I take my second step, inches from the exit of the bathroom. He hasn’t moved, just the flailing of his enormous hand. The man is not much taller than myself, but his extremities give his body a peculiar frame. Long arms, powerful huge hands and broad, bold shoulders to match them. 

I take my third step, breaking the barrier of the bathroom’s threshold. Then the large wafting hand clasps onto the back of my neck. His fingers dig deep into the muscles just underneath the base of my skull. As if I were a child being dragged away from a mess I’d made, the man ushers me down the narrow hallway. I didn’t account for anything physical so early in our introduction but some men just can’t contain themselves. 

He leans closely into my ear. His lips nearly brush against my tragus. “Where is your laptop Kyle?” The spit from his whisper coats my eardrum.

I hesitate, and slow my walk. Surprisingly, he loosens his grip and allows me to turn my head and face him. “My name is not Kyle.” 

We glare at each other for a moment. I leave my mouth agape, breathing lightly. “I’m Jake,” I say “Jake Fitzpatrick.”

The stranger glares longer. His palm then collides with my cheek. Quicker than any pump of adrenaline, he slaps me again. His grasp moves from my nape to my throat. He pushes my head against the wall behind me and leans in close once again. “I will not repeat myself.” 

“I…I’m serious.” I struggle to get out as the heathen presses his hand on my esophagus. He moves upward grabbing ahold of my jaw. I feel his clutch tighten underneath my teeth as he viciously throws me to the floor. Just as I look upward, my head is redirected to the hallway carpet. He swings again, and again, and again. His leather bound fist mimicking a cement block. I feel my face turn warm, and blood drip from my nose. 

The man ceases his beating and stands upward. He looks down on me and holds his gaze. His piercing ocean eyes grow hateful. “I really don’t know man.” I say as bloodied spit leaves my lips in the same sentence. 

He groans and then grabs ahold of my arm. He hoists me halfway up and then tosses me backward into my living room. There goes the towel. 

I’m not sure what chemical my body would have to release next to hinder my astonishment of the stranger’s strength. Somehow, in this horrifying moment, my confusion outweighs my fear. He walks toward me, his boots press softly into my beige carpeting. He crouches in front of me, “Kyle, I know you’re not telling the truth. Quite frankly, I’m not amused. I will begin snapping every bone in your body… Give me the lap-“

Once again, my marvelous brain reacts faster than any lightning bolt could. With zero hesitation, I quickly curl myself in front of the man and eject both legs into his chest, sending him backward. He grunts as I make contact. Within the same movement I leap to my feet. I sprint into my kitchen, which faces open towards the living space. Grabbing the first knife within view, I spin around to face my attacker; who is already back up, moving close, and really, really pissed off. 

As he nears I slash the air in front of him with the serrated steak knife. My family jewels bouncing from thigh to thigh as I attempt my defense efforts. He lowers himself, crouching like an Olympic wrestler. I try to match his height and create distance. We circle each other within the kitchen’s octagon. As we round the countertops I do what any terrified man would do - I grab a second fucking knife. This one however is my large butcher’s knife, its wooden handle still soaked from yesterday’s wash. 

He leaps forward towards my knees. He manages to wrap me and pin me against the lower cabinets. As if I were no weight at all, he lifts me into the air. Just as his momentum begins to shift, and I feel as if he may slam me onto the kitchen counter, I send both knives into his back. The butcher’s knife lands, but makes minimal damage versus the stranger’s leather jacket. The serrated knife, however, finds a sweet spot along the seams, entering his body. 

He grimaces in pain, and lets out a deepened grovel. He then spins and tosses me into the living room like a discarded napkin. I land on the floor, leaving both blades in his back. He falls over, clenching his fists on the ground. Both objects protrude from his back like a bug’s wings preparing for take off. He again slams his fist onto the kitchen’s linoleum. He curses, whimpers, and begins to sweat profusely. 

He spreads his fingers across the floor, and lets out a hideous scream. His hands then burst through his gloves, revealing black fingernails, and horribly hairy knuckles. 

I push my back against the wall, and then gather myself to my feet. The intruder begins to appear to change in mass, but I’m not exactly sure what I’m watching. He cries again as he vomits on the floor. 

He howls, as if he’s never experienced pain like this. Hell, I’ve never experienced whatever is going on. 

He vomits again, spewing food remains and white foam on the kitchen floor. He jerks his head upward. He looks in my general direction, but doesn’t make eye contact with me. His crystal blue eyes begin to weep and his skin blushes and swells around them. He strains his neck, revealing massive veins. 

He cries out again, this time it sounds more like a man. He looks downward, then back up and finally our eyes meet. He’s fucking pissed.

I’m so confined in his invidious gaze, I barely notice his teeth have grown. They’re massive now, actually. Canines point out from his lips and weave through other jagged teeth that now fill his mouth. “What the fuck is happening?” I whisper. 

He hastily pans the room. I try to track where his eyes go but I’m unsure what he’s looking for. His leather outfit tightens around him and begins to pull away at its seams. His skin darkens and fine hairs sprout from his face. He faces me again, this time the side of his jaw pointed towards the ceiling, like how foxes do when they’re curious. 

All at once, as if he finally gave in, his body accelerates into a huge stature. His nails lunge from his fingertips and peel the flooring underneath. His jacket bursts open on his back, and although it faces away from me, I can see long dark hairs spread down his spine. His face pushes forward and he smacks his jaw together as he coughs. His nose stays in place against his face as his cheekbones rise forward. 

He stands up. 

As he rises the butcher’s knife falls from behind him and clatters on the floor. The steak knife still protrudes from his back, hanging on like a loose tooth. He snarls at me, his monstrous teeth move around another set behind them. As if the razor sharp canines were curtains for his human molars. 

I feel myself start to pass out. This has gotten terrifyingly out of hand. 

Like a hail mary throw, my brain sparks its magic once more; I remember what I was doing just before showering. I look to my right and on the coffee table is my laptop. It was gifted to me at my first college, it's a cheap Lenovo, it can totally go. 

Without any hesitation I move towards the table and seize it. I startle the beast, and he moves forward, but halts himself when he comprehends what's in my hand. He’s so much larger than he was seconds ago.

Our eyes meet. I have no idea what this thing in my living room is anymore and I’m praying this gets it out of my sight. I sprint towards the sliding glass door behind me. It leads me out to a wooden deck and I launch the laptop into the parking lot below. Just as soon as it leaves my hand, the hulking figure bursts through the opening and snags the device before it meets the ground. 

His feet slam onto the concrete. Without missing a step he speeds off to the forest in front of him on all fours, carrying the laptop in his mouth (mouths?). His nails click-clack against the pavement until he disappears behind the trees. His body is as dark as the shadows he’s now surrounded by. 

I look downward to find my downstairs neighbor, Cortland, staring at the woods and then back up at me. “You really need to find some nicer girls, champ.”",1,1767039533.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False

Josephine’s mornings had grown quiet. The long-awaited retirement had finally arrived. The radio murmured in the background. The kitchen was filled with the scent of coffee. Sunlight fell across an empty chair at the breakfast table. For a moment, Josephine stared at it, lost in thought. She told herself she was fine, that routine was what she needed. Being alone, being her own person, was what she had always wanted. But deep down, she felt she was not there yet.

While clearing out one of her drawers, Josephine found an old sketchbook. The pages were filled with faces and fleeting moments she’d drawn decades ago. She recognized them. They were moments before marriage, before children, before a life that had asked of her to be everything everyone wanted and needed, everything but an artist.

A wave of motivation came over her. She packed her pencils and a folding chair, and walked to the park. She sat on a bench under an oak tree, sketching quietly: children chasing pigeons, a man reading a newspaper, an elderly couple sharing a snack. The air felt warm and smelled of grass. Distant laughter echoed all around. For the first time in years, her hands trembled not from age, but from a new purpose.

Too shy to approach her inspirations in person, Josephine began leaving some sketches behind on park benches or taping them to lampposts. She would sheepishly look behind as she left, wondering if anyone noticed. Days turned into weeks. Her little antics became a habit, a joyful habit.

One afternoon, a young man approached her, holding one of her drawings. “Excuse me, ma’am. Did you draw this?” he asked, eyes bright. Josephine nodded slightly. “It was pinned to the café board near the fountain,” he explained. “I wanted you to know: I have been seeing quite a few around here.” He paused for a moment, blushing slightly: “I just wanted to tell you, you inspired me. I’m starting art classes next month. Your sketch made me realize I have ignored my own passion for too long.”

Josephine was first shocked by this revelation, then she smiled, a quiet warmth settling in her chest. She had thought she was simply passing time, yet in doing so, she had become an artist who inspired others. She gave him one of her sketching pens. “For good luck,” she said smiling, half-joking. But the man held it like a little treasure. “Thank you,” he replied.
Watching the young man walk away, sketch and pen in hand, Josephine felt a spark of anticipation for him. His journey was just beginning, and she knew the thrill of becoming someone new awaited him too.

Nothing serious, just something to keep an eye out for while thrifting. After a lot of back and forth, I finally decided on the brand and pattern I wanted to look for. After work one day, I stopped by the local thrift store just for fun, with zero expectations that I would actually find anything.

As I walked down the dish aisle, at the very end I spotted those little blue flowers. I honestly could not believe it. There were various bowls, small plates, coffee and tea cups (not shown), and even a random butter dish bottom. I still cannot get over the fact that I found all of this on the very first attempt! Craziness. 

They were not cheap by thrift standards, but far less than buying new. The thrifting gods were definitely good that day. I will say that since then, I have not found a single additional piece. I did manage to find some matching dinner and lunch plates on Facebook Marketplace to help round out the base of the collection.

I’ve already come to terms that the wet towel around my waist will meet the floor below once I move to protect myself. So I will either lose my decency, and beat this guy’s ass while naked, or simply die in the most embarrassing way possible. Oh well, I don’t have much to show off anyway. 

“To open your doors without looking, it’s astonishing. How you just kept your back turned towards its entrance, as if you had nothing to worry about.” It’s true, I hadn’t looked into the hallway after opening the bathroom door, keeping my focus on cleaning my watch with the towel at my hip. But then again, who is expecting this creep to be there waiting for me. 

“I was waiting for you.” Yep, totally makes sense. 

“Who are you?” I whisper. 

“It’s not of any importance, I’m afraid. What is important is what you do next.” The stranger said in his disgustingly thick British accent. 

He waves to me to walk down the hallway. One open hand points down the corridor, his other wafting at me from the wrist. Both of which, much like the rest of his body, are covered by black leather. Gosh, how did I never hear this guy coming?

I take a step toward the hallway, and once again my brain fires off faster than the speed of light. Within this small step I conjured my plan. If this European creep lets me walk across him, he’ll receive an elbow to the jaw. Followed by me working him to the ground. Then when the opportunity presents itself, I’ll sprint towards my phone on the bathroom counter. 

However, if the man walks in front of me and leads me down the hallway - I’ll roll with Plan B. As he escorts me in my own home I’ll quickly gain ground on him. Calmly speed walking and lunge for his knees. That will bring him down and I can use the precious seconds to make it back to my phone. 

I take my second step, inches from the exit of the bathroom. He hasn’t moved, just the flailing of his enormous hand. The man is not much taller than myself, but his extremities give his body a peculiar frame. Long arms, powerful huge hands and broad, bold shoulders to match them. 

I take my third step, breaking the barrier of the bathroom’s threshold. Then the large wafting hand clasps onto the back of my neck. His fingers dig deep into the muscles just underneath the base of my skull. As if I were a child being dragged away from a mess I’d made, the man ushers me down the narrow hallway. I didn’t account for anything physical so early in our introduction but some men just can’t contain themselves. 

He leans closely into my ear. His lips nearly brush against my tragus. “Where is your laptop Kyle?” The spit from his whisper coats my eardrum.

I hesitate, and slow my walk. Surprisingly, he loosens his grip and allows me to turn my head and face him. “My name is not Kyle.” 

We glare at each other for a moment. I leave my mouth agape, breathing lightly. “I’m Jake,” I say “Jake Fitzpatrick.”

The stranger glares longer. His palm then collides with my cheek. Quicker than any pump of adrenaline, he slaps me again. His grasp moves from my nape to my throat. He pushes my head against the wall behind me and leans in close once again. “I will not repeat myself.” 

“I…I’m serious.” I struggle to get out as the heathen presses his hand on my esophagus. He moves upward grabbing ahold of my jaw. I feel his clutch tighten underneath my teeth as he viciously throws me to the floor. Just as I look upward, my head is redirected to the hallway carpet. He swings again, and again, and again. His leather bound fist mimicking a cement block. I feel my face turn warm, and blood drip from my nose. 

The man ceases his beating and stands upward. He looks down on me and holds his gaze. His piercing ocean eyes grow hateful. “I really don’t know man.” I say as bloodied spit leaves my lips in the same sentence. 

He groans and then grabs ahold of my arm. He hoists me halfway up and then tosses me backward into my living room. There goes the towel. 

I’m not sure what chemical my body would have to release next to hinder my astonishment of the stranger’s strength. Somehow, in this horrifying moment, my confusion outweighs my fear. He walks toward me, his boots press softly into my beige carpeting. He crouches in front of me, “Kyle, I know you’re not telling the truth. Quite frankly, I’m not amused. I will begin snapping every bone in your body… Give me the lap-“

Once again, my marvelous brain reacts faster than any lightning bolt could. With zero hesitation, I quickly curl myself in front of the man and eject both legs into his chest, sending him backward. He grunts as I make contact. Within the same movement I leap to my feet. I sprint into my kitchen, which faces open towards the living space. Grabbing the first knife within view, I spin around to face my attacker; who is already back up, moving close, and really, really pissed off. 

As he nears I slash the air in front of him with the serrated steak knife. My family jewels bouncing from thigh to thigh as I attempt my defense efforts. He lowers himself, crouching like an Olympic wrestler. I try to match his height and create distance. We circle each other within the kitchen’s octagon. As we round the countertops I do what any terrified man would do - I grab a second fucking knife. This one however is my large butcher’s knife, its wooden handle still soaked from yesterday’s wash. 

He leaps forward towards my knees. He manages to wrap me and pin me against the lower cabinets. As if I were no weight at all, he lifts me into the air. Just as his momentum begins to shift, and I feel as if he may slam me onto the kitchen counter, I send both knives into his back. The butcher’s knife lands, but makes minimal damage versus the stranger’s leather jacket. The serrated knife, however, finds a sweet spot along the seams, entering his body. 

He grimaces in pain, and lets out a deepened grovel. He then spins and tosses me into the living room like a discarded napkin. I land on the floor, leaving both blades in his back. He falls over, clenching his fists on the ground. Both objects protrude from his back like a bug’s wings preparing for take off. He again slams his fist onto the kitchen’s linoleum. He curses, whimpers, and begins to sweat profusely. 

He spreads his fingers across the floor, and lets out a hideous scream. His hands then burst through his gloves, revealing black fingernails, and horribly hairy knuckles. 

I push my back against the wall, and then gather myself to my feet. The intruder begins to appear to change in mass, but I’m not exactly sure what I’m watching. He cries again as he vomits on the floor. 

He howls, as if he’s never experienced pain like this. Hell, I’ve never experienced whatever is going on. 

He vomits again, spewing food remains and white foam on the kitchen floor. He jerks his head upward. He looks in my general direction, but doesn’t make eye contact with me. His crystal blue eyes begin to weep and his skin blushes and swells around them. He strains his neck, revealing massive veins. 

He cries out again, this time it sounds more like a man. He looks downward, then back up and finally our eyes meet. He’s fucking pissed.

I’m so confined in his invidious gaze, I barely notice his teeth have grown. They’re massive now, actually. Canines point out from his lips and weave through other jagged teeth that now fill his mouth. “What the fuck is happening?” I whisper. 

He hastily pans the room. I try to track where his eyes go but I’m unsure what he’s looking for. His leather outfit tightens around him and begins to pull away at its seams. His skin darkens and fine hairs sprout from his face. He faces me again, this time the side of his jaw pointed towards the ceiling, like how foxes do when they’re curious. 

All at once, as if he finally gave in, his body accelerates into a huge stature. His nails lunge from his fingertips and peel the flooring underneath. His jacket bursts open on his back, and although it faces away from me, I can see long dark hairs spread down his spine. His face pushes forward and he smacks his jaw together as he coughs. His nose stays in place against his face as his cheekbones rise forward. 

He stands up. 

As he rises the butcher’s knife falls from behind him and clatters on the floor. The steak knife still protrudes from his back, hanging on like a loose tooth. He snarls at me, his monstrous teeth move around another set behind them. As if the razor sharp canines were curtains for his human molars. 

I feel myself start to pass out. This has gotten terrifyingly out of hand. 

Like a hail mary throw, my brain sparks its magic once more; I remember what I was doing just before showering. I look to my right and on the coffee table is my laptop. It was gifted to me at my first college, it's a cheap Lenovo, it can totally go. 

Without any hesitation I move towards the table and seize it. I startle the beast, and he moves forward, but halts himself when he comprehends what's in my hand. He’s so much larger than he was seconds ago.

Our eyes meet. I have no idea what this thing in my living room is anymore and I’m praying this gets it out of my sight. I sprint towards the sliding glass door behind me. It leads me out to a wooden deck and I launch the laptop into the parking lot below. Just as soon as it leaves my hand, the hulking figure bursts through the opening and snags the device before it meets the ground. 

His feet slam onto the concrete. Without missing a step he speeds off to the forest in front of him on all fours, carrying the laptop in his mouth (mouths?). His nails click-clack against the pavement until he disappears behind the trees. His body is as dark as the shadows he’s now surrounded by. 

I look downward to find my downstairs neighbor, Cortland, staring at the woods and then back up at me. “You really need to find some nicer girls, champ.”",1,1767039347.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

That was the first text message I got that morning.

It came from an unknown number. No name. No emoji. No follow-up. Just those five words, all caps, like the sender was afraid of being overheard even through a phone.

For a few seconds, I sat up in bed, staring at the screen while my alarm continued to chirp beside me. The early light filtering through my blinds gave my room its usual harmless look: laundry on the chair, posters peeling at the corners, my backpack slumped against the wall. Everything normal. Everything safe.

I checked the time. 6:14 a.m.

I laughed—one sharp breath through my nose. A prank. Spam. Someone messing with me. My friends thought it was funny to send creepy stuff sometimes, especially before exams.

Still, my thumb hovered over the keyboard longer than it should have.

*Who is this?* I typed.

The message showed as delivered. No response.

I tossed the phone onto my bed and stood up, stretching. I had school. A math test. A bus to catch. The real world didn’t pause for anonymous texts.

As I brushed my teeth, I kept glancing at my reflection, half-expecting to see something different. Someone standing behind me. A shadow that didn’t belong to me.

Nothing.

By the time I was dressed, the message had faded into the background noise of my mind—unsettling, but distant. I grabbed my phone again as I headed downstairs.

Another message had come in.

**They know you saw the first one.**

My stomach dropped so suddenly it felt like I’d missed a step on the stairs.

“Mom?” I called, my voice cracking in a way I didn’t like.

“In the kitchen,” she answered, cheerful, unaware.

I stood frozen halfway down the stairs, staring at the screen. My phone buzzed again.

**You have three minutes.**

“Three minutes for what?” I whispered.

I typed again, hands shaking now. *Who are they?*

The response came instantly.

**Not who. What.**

A chill crept up my arms. I suddenly became aware of every sound in the house: the hum of the refrigerator, the tick of the clock, my mom humming softly to herself.

I went into the kitchen, trying to act normal. My mom slid a plate of toast toward me.

“You look pale,” she said. “Did you sleep?”

“Yeah,” I lied.

My phone buzzed on the counter.

**Two minutes.**

I swallowed hard. “Mom… did you get any weird messages this morning?”

She frowned. “No. Why?”

Another buzz.

**They’re closer than you think.**

My chest tightened. “I—I think someone’s messing with me.”

My mom sighed, already reaching for her coffee. “Sweetheart, if it’s a prank, ignore it. You’ll miss your bus.”

The phone vibrated again.

**One minute.**

I felt lightheaded. “Mom, I think we should—”

The lights flickered.

Just once. Quick. Like a blink.

My mom looked up. “Probably the storm last night.”

The phone buzzed again.

**Thirty seconds. Closet. Bathroom. Anywhere without windows. Do NOT be seen.**

My heart slammed against my ribs. This was too specific. Too urgent.

I grabbed my phone and backed away from the counter. “Mom, please, we need to go somewhere else in the house.”

She stared at me, confused now. “What’s going on?”

The lights flickered again—longer this time.

My phone buzzed.

**They’re here.**

A sound came from outside.

Not a knock.

Not footsteps.

A low, dragging scrape, like something heavy being pulled across concrete.

My mom turned toward the front door. “Did someone—”

“Don’t open it,” I said, louder than I meant to.

She froze. “What?”

The scrape came again. Closer. Accompanied by something else now—a faint clicking, irregular, like nails tapping out of sync.

My phone buzzed nonstop, messages stacking faster than I could read.

**DO NOT LET THEM SEE YOU**

**THEY MIMIC**

**HIDE NOW**

The doorbell rang.

It wasn’t the cheerful chime we’d always had. It was distorted, buzzing too long, like someone was leaning on it.

“Mom,” I whispered, tears burning my eyes. “Please.”

She took a step back from the door.

The doorbell stopped.

Silence.

Then a voice came from the other side.

“Hello?” it called.

It sounded exactly like my mom.

She gasped. I felt something inside me snap, a cold understanding settling in.

The voice spoke again. “It’s me. I forgot my keys.”

My mom covered her mouth with her hand.

The phone buzzed once more.

**That is not her.**

The handle on the door slowly began to turn.

I grabbed my mom’s wrist and pulled her toward the hallway. We ran, slipping on the tile, my heart pounding so loud I was sure *it* could hear us.

Behind us, the front door creaked open.

Footsteps entered the house.

Slow. Careful.

Learning.

We dove into the bathroom and slammed the door, locking it just as something brushed against the hallway wall. I dragged my mom into the bathtub and yanked the shower curtain closed, then turned off the lights.

We huddled there in the dark, barely breathing.

The footsteps moved closer.

The bathroom door handle jiggled.

Then a voice—my voice—spoke softly from just outside.

“I know you’re scared. It’s okay. You can come out now.”

My mom clutched my arm so hard it hurt.

The handle stopped moving.

Silence stretched, heavy and unbearable.

Minutes passed. Or hours. I couldn’t tell.

My phone buzzed faintly in my hand.

**Good. Stay still. They lose interest if they can’t confirm you.**

I typed with trembling fingers. *What are they?*

The response came slower this time.

**We don’t know. They appear, they copy, they replace. We only know how to survive them.**

Another message followed.

**You weren’t the first one we warned.**

A sudden crash came from the living room—the sound of something being knocked over, followed by that same dragging scrape.

Then footsteps moved toward the back door.

The house fell quiet again.

We stayed hidden until the sun was fully up, until my phone battery dipped into the red, until the fear dulled enough for exhaustion to take over.

Eventually, we heard sirens outside. Neighbors gathering. Someone shouting about a break-in.

The police said there was no sign of forced entry.

They said nothing was missing.

They said maybe someone had just walked into the wrong house.

That night, after everything settled, after my mom finally fell asleep on the couch beside me, I plugged in my phone and scrolled back through the messages.

The number was gone.

Not deleted.

Gone.

No sender. No record. Like it had never existed.

Except for one final message, timestamped hours after the others.

**We’ll text again if you survive tomorrow.**

I locked my phone and stared at the dark window across the room.

Outside, someone was standing on the sidewalk.

Watching the house.

Smiling with my face.

As we roll into the final days of the year, it feels like a good moment to pause and appreciate what a fun one it’s been. So many gatherings, lights, traditions, and little community moments — and now we’re easing into the softer side of the season. Fewer big plans, more choosing what sounds good, and a lot of “let’s just enjoy this part.”

⸻

New Year’s Eve – Local & Nearby

• New Year’s Eve at the Roxy (Bremerton)

Live music, a countdown, and a classic local venue option if you want to stay on this side of the water.

• Bingo at The Garage Bar & Grill (Bremerton)

An adults-only New Year’s bingo night. Expect humor, ADULT prizes, and absolutely no attempt at being family-friendly. Very much a “leave the kids at home” situation. You’ll want to Google this if you don’t know what I’m talking about. 

• Low-key NYE around town

Several local bars and gathering spots typically host small DJ nights or casual countdowns. Nothing huge, but plenty of “out without being overwhelmed” options.

⸻

Watching the Space Needle Fireworks (From Kitsap)

If skies are clear, some folks try for distant views of the Seattle fireworks from across the Sound. It’s not guaranteed, but common viewing attempts include:

	•	Bainbridge Island waterfront / Winslow area

	•	Kingston shoreline

	•	East-facing viewpoints with elevation

Think faint bursts and skyline glow, not front-row seats — but still kind of fun if conditions cooperate. If the weather doesn’t cooperate, you can always count down with your television! The last few years have included a drone show.

⸻

Still in the Holiday Spirit (Family-Friendly, Ongoing)

• Neighborhood light viewing

Plenty of neighborhoods, marinas, and waterfront areas stay lit through New Year’s and beyond. Easy evening drives or short walks with cocoa energy.

• Quiet seasonal outings

This is a popular window for low-key beach walks, short hikes during rain breaks, coffee runs, and letting kids burn energy without crowds.

• Home-based holiday mode

Board games, movies, baking, leftover treats, and not rushing anywhere. Very much still the season for it.

⸻

We’re in that gentle glide toward the new year now — less rushing, more enjoying what’s right in front of us. Whether you’re ringing it in with bingo cards, fireworks glimpses, music, or pajamas, it all counts.

If you know of something specific happening — especially family-friendly or very clearly not — feel free to add it.",1,1767039289.0,LifeInKitsap,0,0.67,False

This is going to sound a little crazy, but I need some advice anyway. Just want to start by saying that I've never had any problems with paranoia, delusions or psychosis, and I don't believe in ghosts or anything like that. I'm also 35 years old now, so it's unlikely that those type of mental issues would arise at such a late age.

That being said, I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm pretty sure someone moves small things in my apartment when I'm not home. I live alone and no one, as far as I know, has a key to my apartment. I have two keys and both are in my possession (I have checked several times).

I have tried putting glasses and plates on the table as a test before I go to work, and have taken pictures of them to compare with the pictures when I get home. So far I have not been successful in proving anything.

The most obvious things that I have noticed that have moved are a plate I had breakfast on that day moved maybe 30 cm from where I put it, candles have moved from the center of the coffee table to the edge of the table, and a shampoo bottle has moved from one shelf to another that I never use to store shampoo on. There are several other things I have noticed, but they are very small things that ""maybe/maybe not"" could be me now that I am so aware of where everything is. 

My ex-boyfriend had the key to my apartment for many years before we broke up two years ago. We didn't fall out, and he has a new girlfriend now, so I'm 99% sure it's not him. He also works in Copenhagen now several days a week, while I live in Jutland. I have asked him on days when things have moved, where he was, and he has been in Copenhagen all those days. He shared his location on Messenger, so that was enough.

What would you do? I have no evidence of anything and in principle I could have been sleepwalking or something and just not noticed the changes until I got back home from work. I occasionally sleepwalked as a child, but as far as I know it hasn't happened in maybe 25 years. It's starting to get pretty creepy…

> There is a well-known Reddit thread that sounds very similar to what you describe - It turned out that the person had severe carbon monoxide poisoning that created paranoia and delusions. I would strongly advise you to see if you can find somewhere else to sleep for the next few nights and then buy a detector - They are available at Bauhaus and the like.

> Maybe it's not, maybe you're just forgetful, but if it's carbon monoxide, you're messing with your life.

>>Thanks! I just googled it. I'm staying with my parents tonight and then I'll buy a carbon monoxide detector tomorrow, just in case.

>>>If that doesn't work, then you can buy a wildlife camera and set it up. It takes pictures when there is movement, so you can see if you are doing it in your sleep or what 🙂.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/DKbrevkasse/s/H2icDbizfd)  **Jan 22, 2025**

[UPDATE] Hi again everyone :) A lot has happened since I wrote the post. I've figured out what's up with the “situation”. I bought two cameras, and set one up in the living room/kitchen and one in the entrance hall.

It turns out my apartment actually has three keys and not two, as I thought. My neighbour (also 35 years old) apparently looked after the previous tenants' cat occasionally, and had a key to their apartment. She didn't return it after they moved out of what is now my apartment.

We were pretty good friends to start with, when I moved in, but she became more and more “clingy”, to the extent that she would call up to 15 times a day, and talk for over 4 hours in total per day. I couldn't even leave the apartment without her wanting to know where I was going, and she would get angry if I didn't respond immediately to her messages, if I was asleep or busy. There was so much drama surrounding her, that I couldn't take it anymore, and chose to completely cut off contact. She has respected that for the most part, I thought.

It turns out that she has let herself into my apartment and gone through my cupboards and drawers, and apparently deliberately moved my things around to make me paranoid. She can hear when I go in and out of my apartment, because her entrance is only 5 meters from mine - that's why she always knew when I wasn't home, even though I work shifting hours.

I confronted her, and said that I would call the police. She panicked and contacted her father, who came over to me. He is a doctor and said that she has borderline personality disorder, and refuses treatment because she doesn't think she's wrong. He said she is impulsive, outwardly reacting and often feels a strong urge to “revenge” herself on people who she feels have treated her unfairly or let her down. This has apparently been a theme throughout her life with almost all her relationships; romantic and friendships.

He practically begged me not to call the police, and said that he would do everything he can to prevent anything similar from happening again. I got him to pay for a locksmith to change the lock, and I said that I would report her to the housing association (who would then report her to the police), if she didn't voluntarily move out of the apartment as soon as possible, because I don't want her as a neighbour anymore. They both accepted that, and she has now chosen to move back to her parents at the end of February.

So the ending was relatively good for me, albeit very chaotic.
