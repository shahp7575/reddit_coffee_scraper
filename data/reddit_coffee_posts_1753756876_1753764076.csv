Good day po! Has anyone here tried taking Motivest (fluoxetine) and Abdin (aripiprazole) together, especially in the mornings?

I understand Motivest is supposed to help with energy and mood, but I’ve been feeling persistently sleepy and drained all day, despite getting 7–8 hours of sleep every night. I also drink at least two cups of coffee daily, pero ang hirap pa rin mag-focus and concentrate.

Is it possible that the combo itself is making me feel this way? I’d appreciate hearing others’ experiences or any tips that helped you manage this kind of fatigue. Salamat po 🙏",1,1753763803.0,u_Legitimate_Editor379,0,1.0,False

I usually just read other people’s stories, but I guess now I’m the one looking for some outsider perspective. I don’t even know if I’m overthinking or just too in my head right now or maybe I’m just blowing this out of proportion Idk I’m a mess right now but anyways….this is going to be a long read sorry.

I’m Julian, 21M, and my girlfriend Elena is 30F. Yes, I know the age gap’s a thing. 9 years, people always have something to say about it, but I’m a grown adult, alright and I get that it looks ""weird"" to some people, but it’s not like that. We’re in love, like, I can’t imagine my life without her. She’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. We’ve been together for about a year, and she’s so amazing, always looking out for me when I was in a really bad spot.

I dropped out of community college last year cause I couldn’t handle classes and work, plus stuff at home was a total mess. My mom’s been struggling with drinking and mental health stuff since my dad died when I was a kid. I was stuck paying bills, keeping the house together, all that. It got so bad I had to crash with a friend, but that was rough too.

Me and Elena met when I was working at a coffee shop a couple blocks from her office at this big graphic design company that does branding for huge clients. She’s a senior designer there, super talented, not running the place but she has a solid role. She’d come in most mornings for her usual black coffee, sometimes a latte if she was in a good mood. We started talking while I made her drinks, first about the music on the shop’s playlist: we both love indie bands like Tame Impala and Phoebe Bridgers. Then we got into graphic design, cause I used to mess around with Photoshop and Illustrator, making posters for my friends’ bands just for fun when I was younger. She’d talk about her work, like designing logos or client presentations, and I thought she was so beautiful, way out of my league with a really nice smile and charming personality and so of course I’d get all nervous around her, but she was always so nice, never made me feel dumb for stumbling over my words.

One day, she mentioned their team was short-staffed cause an office assistant quit, and they needed someone to handle stuff like emails, scheduling meetings, and organizing project files. I’d told her the coffee shop job sucked: It had bad pay and brutal hours. She asked if I’d ever thought about office work, and I was like, “Not really, but I’d try it.” She didn’t promise me anything, just said they were hiring and I should apply. I thought there was no way I’d get it, but I was desperate, so I sent my resume, got an interview, and somehow landed the job as a junior office assistant.

We kept talking at work, got super close, and a few months later, we started dating. When my friend’s lease ended and I had nowhere to go, she let me move into her apartment. She’s never made me feel like I owe her, and I’m so grateful. She’s always doing sweet stuff, like buying me gifts, shoes, watches, or picking out clothes she thinks I look good in and I trust her cause she’s got such good taste. It’s the first time I’ve felt very secure and at peace.

But last Friday, we had this big fight, and I’m still so upset, mostly at myself. Elena invited some friends over for dinner at her place, like 5 or 6 people. I’d only met one of them before, and I suck at meeting new people. My social anxiety’s bad, I get sweaty hands and can’t think of what to say. I didn’t wanna ruin the vibe, so I tried to act normal, laugh at their jokes, throw in a comment or two. I even wore this new t shirt she had picked out for me, thinking it’d help me fit in, but I still felt like I didn’t belong. They’re all her age, talking about their careers, marketing campaigns, stuff I don’t really get.

At one point, I tried to hold her hand on the table, cause I was freaking out inside and just wanted to feel close to her or maybe reassured and just needed simple cute contact but she brushed my hand off and pulled her hand away super fast and kept talking to her friend like nothing. I know it’s a small thing, but it did hurt me so bad and I felt like she was embarrassed of me or didn’t want them to know we’re together. I sat there the rest of dinner feeling dumb, stupid, awkward and so out of place.

After her friends left, we were cleaning up in the kitchen, and I told her I felt ignored and mentioned the hand thing. I wasn’t trying to pick a fight, I swear, just wanted her to understand how tough it was for me. But she got annoyed and said I was “making everything about me” and that I’m “always so awkward” around her friends and it's not her fault I lack social skills. I’ve told her about my social anxiety, and she’s usually so supportive, and she's even seen me work through it even, but this time it felt like she was throwing it in my face.

I then asked why she pulled her hand away, and she said I was being “way too sensitive” and imagining stuff and that never happened. We started arguing louder, and yeah, I cried I was really frustrated. I hate fighting/or any sort of conflict with her. It genuinely makes me feel awful, and I felt so shut down. She said sorry later that night, but I couldn’t shake it and her apology didn’t feel sincere to me I felt like she just apologized for the sake of it.

The next day, I grabbed some clothes and went to my mom’s to get some space. My mom’s trying to stay sober, but it’s a roller coaster, and being there’s not great she just watches TV all day, barely talks and sleeps, its a bit awkward every time we talk but it’s a familiar place to be I guess. She noticed I had been quiet and asked what’s up, so I told her most of it and why we fought. She already knew about me and Elena. She wasn’t happy about the age gap at first when I told her we were dating, with all the chaos in my life back then, but she got over it when she saw I wasn’t gonna break up with her just cause people don’t get it. I told her I love her and I mean it so so much. I’m an adult, and this is my choice. She didn’t say much, but last night she said, “You gotta listen to your heart and pick what you really want, not what’s easy. What do you want?” I don’t even know how to answer that. I’m so confused right now.

It’s been a few days, and my girlfriend’s been texting and calling, saying she’s sorry and wants to talk again but I haven’t replied. I don’t know if I’m being a jerk or just need space. I love her so much, but I hate feeling like I’m too much or not good enough for her.",1,1753763400.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

# Choosing Your Espresso Machine

Starting your journey with espresso can be exciting. The right machine makes all the difference. A good espresso machine helps you brew the perfect cup every time. Understanding the features and types is crucial. Let’s dive into how you can select the best one for your needs.

# Types Of Espresso Machines

Espresso machines come in various types. Manual machines give you full control. Semi-automatic machines provide convenience while maintaining some control. Automatic machines are easy to use and require less effort. Super-automatic machines do everything for you, including grinding and brewing. Each type offers a different experience.

# Important Features To Consider

When choosing a machine, look at these features:

* Pressure: Look for machines with at least 9 bars of pressure.
* Boiler Type: Single boilers are cheaper; dual boilers offer better temperature control.
* Grinder: Built-in grinders save space and are convenient.
* Ease of Cleaning: Removable parts make cleaning easy.

# Setting Your Budget

Budget plays a big role in choosing a machine. Decide how much you’re willing to spend. Entry-level machines can start around $100. High-end models may cost over $1,000. Consider what features are most important to you.

# Reading Reviews And Recommendations

Reading reviews helps you understand the pros and cons of each model. Look for feedback on performance and durability. Recommendations from friends or online forums can be helpful. They give real-world insights and experiences.

# Essential Accessories

Learning to use an [espresso machine](https://gomehedi.com/best-espresso-machine-for-beginners/) can be exciting. There are many accessories to consider. These tools can make the process smoother. With the right equipment, you can make delicious coffee at home. Let’s explore the essential items you need.

# Grinder

The grinder is a must-have accessory. It ensures your coffee is fresh. Freshly ground beans taste better. Choose a burr grinder over a blade grinder. Burr grinders offer consistent grind size. This results in better espresso.

# Tamper

A tamper is used to pack coffee grounds. It helps create a firm puck. This ensures water flows evenly through the coffee. A good tamper fits snugly in the portafilter. Look for one with a comfortable grip.

# Milk Frother

If you enjoy milk-based drinks, a milk frother is essential. It helps create creamy foam for lattes and cappuccinos. Some espresso machines have built-in frothers. If not, consider buying a separate one. Look for a frother that is easy to clean.

# Cleaning Tools

Keeping your machine clean is important. Cleaning tools include brushes and descaling solutions. Regular cleaning extends the machine’s life. It also ensures the best tasting coffee. Follow the manufacturer’s cleaning instructions.

# Scale

A scale is useful for measuring coffee and water. Accurate measurements lead to consistent results. Look for a scale with a timer. This helps you track brewing time. It’s a small tool with a big impact.

# Setting Up Your Machine

Starting with an espresso machine can be exciting. The aroma of fresh coffee fills the air. But first, you need to set it up. Whether it’s your first time or you’re trying a new machine, understanding the basics is key. Let’s explore how to get your espresso machine ready for use.

# ${example}

Begin by reading the instruction manual. Each machine has its own quirks. Knowing them helps avoid mistakes. Ensure the machine is on a stable surface. This prevents any accidents. Stability is essential for proper functioning.

Next, check the water reservoir. Fill it with clean, cold water. Avoid using warm water. This ensures your coffee tastes fresh. Some machines have specific water requirements. Always adhere to these guidelines.

Insert the portafilter correctly. Make sure it clicks into place. A loose portafilter can affect extraction. Check the seals and gaskets. These should be tight and secure. Proper insertion ensures consistency in each cup.

Finally, test the machine with a dry run. This means running water through the system. It helps clear any dust or residue. Do not use coffee for this test. Just water, to ensure cleanliness.

# Grinding The Coffee

Learning to use an espresso machine can seem daunting at first. But with a bit of practice, it becomes much simpler. One of the key steps is grinding the coffee. A good grind can make or break your espresso. It’s important to pay attention to the details. This guide will help you understand the basics. Soon, you’ll be making delicious espresso at home.

# Grind Size Matters

Choosing the right **grind size**is very important. A fine grind is usually best for espresso. It should feel like fine sand. If the grind is too coarse, the water will pass through too quickly. This can result in a weak coffee. On the other hand, if it’s too fine, it might clog the machine. This can cause a bitter taste. Here are some tips to get it right:

* Start with a small amount of coffee.
* Test the grind size before brewing.
* Adjust based on taste and extraction time.

Using a grinder with settings can help. Experiment with different settings to find what works best. Remember, practice makes perfect. The right grind size can enhance the flavor of your espresso. Keep testing and adjusting until you find your perfect cup.

# Using Fresh Beans

**Fresh beans**are crucial for a good espresso. They should be used within two weeks of roasting. Old beans lose their flavor and aroma. When buying beans, check the roast date. Here’s a simple guide to ensure freshness:

|Bean Type|Roast Date|Best Used By|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Arabica|Within 7 days|14 days|
|Robusta|Within 5 days|10 days|

Store your beans in an airtight container. Keep them away from light and heat. This will help maintain their freshness. Use only what you need. Grind just before brewing. This ensures the best flavor and aroma in each cup.

# Tamping Techniques

Learning to use an espresso machine can be both exciting and challenging. For beginners, understanding the basics is crucial to making a perfect cup. Among these basics, tamping techniques play a key role. Tamping ensures that the coffee grounds are packed well in the portafilter. This process affects the taste and quality of your espresso. With the right tamping methods, you can enjoy a rich and flavorful espresso every time. Let’s explore some essential tamping techniques to enhance your espresso-making skills.

# Applying Even Pressure

Applying even pressure is essential for a balanced espresso shot. Uneven pressure can lead to uneven extraction. This means some parts of the coffee puck may be over-extracted while others are under-extracted. To apply even pressure, follow these steps:

* Hold the tamper firmly with your dominant hand.
* Keep your arm at a 90-degree angle for stability.
* Press down with consistent force, around 30 pounds of pressure.
* Ensure the surface of the coffee is flat and even.

Using a bathroom scale can help practice the right pressure. Consistency is key. With practice, you will develop a feel for the correct pressure. Remember, the goal is to create a uniform coffee bed for even extraction.

# Importance Of Leveling

Leveling the coffee grounds is another crucial step. Level coffee grounds prevent channeling during extraction. Channeling happens when water finds weak spots and flows through them. This results in a weak or bitter espresso shot. To ensure proper leveling, consider the following tips:

* Distribute coffee evenly before tamping.
* Use a distribution tool if available.
* Spin the portafilter gently to level the grounds.

A flat coffee bed ensures uniform water flow. This leads to a balanced extraction and a perfect espresso shot. Leveling is simple but makes a significant difference. Consistent practice will improve your tamping skills and espresso quality.

# Brewing Process

Espresso machines are a popular way to make coffee at home. They can be tricky for beginners. Understanding the brewing process is key. It involves several steps, including water temperature and extraction time. Learning these basics will help you make a delicious espresso. This guide will walk you through the process, so you can start brewing with confidence.

# Water Temperature

Water temperature is crucial for a perfect espresso. The ideal range is 195°F to 205°F. Too hot or too cold water can affect the taste. Hot water can make the coffee bitter. Cold water can result in weak flavor. It’s important to check the temperature before brewing.

Most espresso machines have a built-in thermometer. Use it to monitor the temperature. If your machine doesn’t have one, use a kitchen thermometer. Adjust the machine settings to reach the ideal temperature. Consistent temperature helps in extracting flavors properly.

Here are some tips to maintain the right temperature:

* Preheat the machine for a few minutes.
* Use fresh, cold water in the reservoir.
* Ensure the machine is clean and free from scale.

By focusing on water temperature, you can enhance the espresso taste. It’s a simple step, but very important in brewing.

1mc22kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1mc22kb/ghosted/,Ghosted.,"45/bi woman. Been single since 2013. Only dated 4 or 5 people in my life (if you count people in high school that you ""went out with"" but only ever saw at school.) One long term relationship. Haven't had sex since 2013. Went on a handful of first dates in 2015 but nothing ever went beyond that. Have a SA history and some mental illness so I gave myself some grace with the first 5 years of being alone. Got myself into therapy and have done a lot of work to make myself a decent person... but the mental illness will always be a thing in my life and I'm awkward socially. Not really attractive either. I have a really angry face even when I'm happy. Rejected by basically any person I ever had feelings for with the exception of my one long term ex. Anyway, its the same cycle every few years ever since I was a kid... I fall for someone, they find out I like them and get disgusted, never talk to me again, their friends side with them and I'm left with no one. Repeat. I've switched friend groups so many times in my life. No one I know now knows about the past ones except for a few people. I left college because of it. I have communities I can never show my face in again because of it. It's mortifying and embarassing to be the fugly gross woman no one wants attracted to them (sorry if that talk isn't allowed- let me know and I will edit but its the truth.) Anyways. Moved to a new city last year that I knew some folks in, and had communities for some of my hobbies. Had a friend I knew a little- not well, but we knew each other and would see each other maybe once a year, and he was always... weird around me. When he found out I'd moved to town, he was super excited about it. A little extra. We saw each other every few weeks since I got here- always hanging out a little longer each time. Always hugging a little longer each time. I suspected he might have feelings, but I always suspect people have feelings for me and they don't. But, I kept an open mind. The feelings were mutual. He had always been in the back of my mind, but I largely gave up on trying to date, and I knew it would be super unlikely that he'd actually be interested so I didn't let myself have feelings. In the spring it got more intense- he spent more time with me at social events. We started messaging on social media and he gave me his number. We texted off and on and then the last time I saw him- we hung out for hours. All of our friends left and we stayed at the bar until it closed. When we finally left, we hugged forever and he said I gave the best hugs. I had texts from him before I was even home saying how good it was to see me. We texted every day that week- from as soon as we got home from work until we went to bed. We sent pictures. He dropped a million hints about how he was ""going to dinner by himself"" and I was too afraid to say anything because I was afraid of being rejected. He told me I was hot. No one has ever told me I was hot. Finally I suggested that we should meet up sometime. We decided to meet up a few days later. We continued to talk every night. He was supposed to hang out with his friends but blew them off to talk to me all night. He started saying that I should come over... or maybe come over my place. We talked until midnight. Then the next day, he had a concert to go to, so I didnt expect texts. I texted him and told him to have fun. He sent me a picture from the show. The next day was the day before we were supposed to go out. I looked up places to go- we were only going out for coffee or drinks, nothing crazy- and I texted him to pick a time and place to meet up. He told me he had to cancel, he had a rehearsal he forgot about, but we'd get together soon. I was bummed, but he hadn't let me down so far and it seemed like an honest mistake. The guy has a lot going on so no surprise. And then I didn't hear from him again. I shot him one message to ask him how his week was, he sent me one saying it was OK and he was hanging out with a friend. And that's it. Ghosted and abandoned.

I am not surprised but I am still absolutely shattered. This was the closest I've been to a date or someone liking me in 12 years. I've never had anyone pursue me like that or tell me I was attractive in my entire life. He was absolutely adorable and smart, kind, talented and well put together and I was totally smitten. Anyways, I didnt tell anyone except my therapist and one friend that lives really far away (and I didnt even tell that person who the guy was) because we have too many mutual friends and I couldn't let it ruin the rest of my friendships. I'm mortified that someone will find out. So none of our friends know (unless he's told anyone.) You folks reading this are the only folks that know the details. I can only assume he found out about the mental health issues, or the fact that i haven't been with anyone in 12 years, or just put on his glasses and came to his senses and realized I was fucking gross. It's all fine, he has no trouble dating and will go on about his life, and I don't blame him. But I'm crushed and I'm just grieving the fact that love and relationships are just things that I won't ever get to experience ever again. I lost that with my ex (who i honestly dont think ever actually loved me.) The ups and downs of this have been so hard for me- the emotions are just extremes and its been a roller-coaster and I can't put myself through this again. I fight bipolar disorder and anxiety on a good day- this is just too much. The highs and lows are exhausting and its unhealthy for this to affect me so hard. And I'm just embarrassed by it all- how could I be so stupid to think he liked me? I just feel like an idiot and im beating myself up over it and I'm too ashamed to tell anyone else.

Why do you have me suspended in this spellbound thought that maybe we saw each other…

Don’t get me wrong others have seen me but not in this state of physical Energy.


So are you going to distance yourself and remain safe……or are you going to allow the Sapphire Flames lure you in.

Will you be excited to see me like the last time?

Will you reject my invitation or accept it without hesitation.

Will my mouth let me speak or will my younger be held.

Will I break the curse upon me and express my gratitude towards your kindness making me laugh and smile being physically present making it known by always showing up.


So I’ve had more time to think about this.


It’s so smooth and comfortable when we talk.

I didn’t go seeking you out like I normally do.

You didn’t make me chase you….you met me halfway….

It seems we both have an interest and are both very respectful of each other’s boundaries….i like that I don’t feel the ball in either court it’s not a 1v1.

I had asked about your neckless thinking that it was Sumerian but you corrected me then it was just a nice conversation while I got my coffee….then slowly it was more and more conversation and then Mr.C became a great guy? 

That makes me wonder why? What makes you believe or think that?

💭 does that hold any weight? Or is it just a friendly comment? Why tell coworkers that Mr.C is a great guy??

Why get off the ladder you had been on for something I didn’t look I noticed you from the corner of my eye and didn’t want to be that guy then BOOM 💥 your out the window chatting it up.🥰

God knows my Pisces ass eats that attention up since it’s been so long anyone’s shown physical activity you show up in person every time I come through, you make your presence known and it follows it’s with own Energy that’s very electric! 🥵 I don’t think you’re just pretty or just beautiful.

I see you and I see someone unique someone elegant someone Extraordinary.


I would say you’re awesome but that’s lame to say.

I would say amazing but that seems like it’s too weak.

So extraordinarily extravagant seem to fit.


You melted my ass when you started sticking your tongue 😛 out at my son…..🥰😱🤤 again I’ve said it before but I don’t know what one hits harder because.


First that’s mini me.
My daughter isn’t my wingwoman she’s way way too social 🙃

My son doesn’t like people and he got super excited to see you and to see you playing with him when you didn’t have to do even acknowledge him…that still rides my thoughts hourly damn.

As a Pisces it really makes a difference.


So just know I really respect and appreciate you while I’d love to get to know you more and spend time with you even just talking I don’t want to damage anything I don’t want to give you a damaged heart to hold.

While I believe you might be the one who has the best luck at healing those wounds.

I can only speculate on my observations and my own feelings.

You show up every time I come through you stop come out and we talk for however long that might be.

You acknowledged my son….nothing made you do that but your own free will…

You’ve made me laugh and smile and I see you smile and laugh every time we talk….

So if you’re willing to take that leap of faith I won’t hold you as tight as anyone before I will let you choose how close you want to come and how tightly to be held.

I’ll see you again if it’s written so we shall see how the story goes.


God knows I’m not writing it.

Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron. — 1 TIMOTHY 4:2
 
Keep a tender conscience — don’t violate it — because it is your conscience, the voice of your spirit, that relates to your mind what the spirit of God is saying to you down inside. If you don’t keep a tender conscience, spiritual things will not be clear to you.

During the mid-’30s, I pastored a country church and usually spent Sunday nights in the home of a dear old gentleman who was about eighty-nine years old. He and I didn’t get up as early as the rest of his family on this farm, so we had breakfast together about 8 o’clock. He’d have one of those old-fashioned coffee pots sitting on the woodstove with the coffee just boiling in it. I’ve seen him pour that boiling coffee into a mug, hold it up to his mouth, and drink the whole cup of boiling coffee in one gulp. The first time I saw him do it, I felt like I was burning all the way down!

How could he do that? I certainly couldn’t do it. My mouth and throat are so tender, one teaspoon of boiling coffee would have burned me. He couldn’t do it either, to begin with. But through the years, drinking boiling coffee had seared this man’s lips, mouth, and throat, until it was easy for him to drink the whole cup of boiling coffee in one gulp.

The same thing can happen spiritually. Keep a tender conscience. Stop the minute you miss it and your conscience condemns you. Say, “Lord, forgive me. I missed it.” Or if you need to, tell someone you have wronged, “I did wrong. Please forgive me.”
 
Confession:
I keep my conscience tender.

***

[""You are afraid to kill,""](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1k0lbgd/musings_on_power_songs_of_truth/) the siren said mockingly. ""Because you are weak-willed. And cowardly. It is among the least of your flaws.""

Magic prickles at the edge of my vision. I blink, hard, like it will help me force it away from my mind. I believe that it works.

""You will put your bow down,"" she says, voice low and melodic. I am a feral animal, and she is calming me down.

""Stop it,"" I say instinctively, though I don't know what exactly I am asking her to stop. I remember that we were having a conversation, and then I pulled out my bow. I lower it. I am out of control.

""Stop?"" She sounds scared, suddenly. She was goading me before, but that might have been something I had imagined. ""You are the only one with a weapon here. I generously invited you to stay with me on my island. Mortals have died for the knowledge I gave you freely. This can not be how I am repaid.""

""I'm sorry."" If sense will not stop me, then shame will. She walks over to me and pulls the bow from my hands. I hear a faint splash as she tosses the weapon into the ocean.

""You have become accustomed to a world in which violence is the norm. You did not know any other way of responding."" Her voice is soothing again. Like I imagine a mother would sound like, if I ever had one. She leads me away to the other side of the island. ""I am glad you stopped. I knew you were not beyond redemption.""

""I don't want to be like this,"" I find myself admitting, before I take a seat on the sand. ""The way I am.""

""You don't have to be anything."" I am being given permission to rest, and so I do.

Some undercurrent of my mind echoes with the sound of singing. I am in danger, maybe. But I am more tired than I have ever been in my life, and I don't know how to resist anymore. I let the wave of unconciousness pull me under. 

**

I don't think it's real, when I wake up inside someone else's living room. All of my senses are dulled by the incessant pounding in my head,but I know I am not on the island I passed out on. I am on an unfamiliar couch, a blue blanket thrown over me. I should be dead, and I am not.

The room is small and wood-paneled. This is one of those beach cabins that people can rent. The ocean is visible through one window, but I decide that I don't want to look at it. Instead, I turn my gaze towards the television that flickers in front of me. I watch, dazed, as helicopters surround the Golden Gate bridge. Crews of boats pull twisted metal from the water.

""Duke. She's awake.""

A girl appears in the doorway. She is tall and statuesque, and beautiful in the way that most demigods are. Her grey eyes are cold as she watches me.

Seconds later, a broad-shouldered boy in a green cloak walks in, holding two coffee mugs in his hands. I am sick, suddenly. This is not a blue blanket. I throw the cloak off of me and get ready to run.

""Don't be stupid."" Duke's voice is low and threatening. I feel a numbing aura dull my senses further, and the fight goes out of me. ""I'll knock you out. If I keep wasting my time on healing you I'll–""

""Chill. She thinks we're going to kill her,"" the girl chastises. She turns her gaze back to me,  ""Listen to me. My name is Penelope. It is April 17th. We were tracking the siren and found you. You've been in and out of consciousness for a day.""

""You attacked New Argos,"" I say, through gritted teeth. The act of talking hurts my throat, but I can't. I can't be here. I don’t want to end up like Hugo.

Penelope shrugs. ""We needed those plans so we could free Atlas. Hephaestus helped.""

I keep my mouth shut. I do not know anything. I turn to look at the TV, watching as they continue to pull cars out of San Francisco bay. Atlas had been imprisoned there, on a mountain. I remember that.

""It worked. He's free,"" Duke cuts in. He sips from his coffee mug. ""From his eternal punishment. He's overthrowing the gods.""

He pauses expectantly. I oblige. ""How?""

""How do you think? He's gonna rip Zeus to shreds. Him and his little loyalist army.""

I am acutely aware of my traffic cone orange shirt, pegasus emblazoned across the front.

""I'm not telling you anything,"" I say. I try to mean it. The bravado crumbles as my voice cracks. ""It's not real. We're not loyalists. They don't care about us.""

Penelope and Duke exchange a look. I get an ounce of pity, which is the best I can ask for these days.

""We know,"" Duke replies. ""Not all of you are. That's why we gave anyone who isn't brainwashed three days to leave.""

""Three days?""

""Be grateful. It's a hell of a lot better than New Argos ever got."" There is sudden venom in Duke's voice, and I don’t know who it's directed at.

""Duke is from New Argos,"" Penelope explains. ""He's right. The campers can join us or go home. We don't want to destroy the innocent.""

I scoff. ""You're insane.""

""You're in denial. This is strategic. Camp Half-Blood is a training camp. We're not aimlessly targeting non-combatants. You have to know that the only cry for change that a tyrant can not ignore is violence.""

I do know this. I have wanted my words to work instead, because I did not want this. But it is true. I nod. Penelope grins, for the first time. It is an unparalleled joy to be understood.

She continues. ""The gods don't care about you. Their safety is superficial and their promises are empty. You will fight in this war, inevitably. If you fight on their side, their corrupt system will only continue. On this side, you will get the chance to shape the world into something new.""

I watch the TV again. ""What happened to the bridge?""

Penelopes expression darkens. ""He destroyed it.""

I can't hold back a laugh. ""It's more of the same.""

""There is more opportunity for challenge in chaos than in tradition. The weight of the sky can still be returned to him,"" Penelope insists. ""If I could do this any other way, I would. But power does not bend to reason. It only ever bends to power. Atlas has it in spades. We need him.""

*The gods do not listen to inferior beings, and neither do I.* I have learned this the hard way. I dig my nails into my skin, unwilling to agree.

""So Atlas is a megalomaniac,"" Duke says. ""That doesn't make everyone under him is evil. We were supposed to recruit the siren, you know. We could've left you there.""

""Don't act like I owe you,"" I say bitterly.  I decide my fate. ""I'm not fighting your war. You should have left me there to die.""

Duke laughs. Penelope purses her lips. Neither of them take up arms against me. It would be too easy that way. ""If you want to die so badly you can take off again, when we bring you back to camp. I don't think you will.""

My blood runs cold. They do not want me to leave camp with everyone else. They want me to do something worse. Penelope's gaze is steel, cutting into me. 

""It'll be easy work,"" she states, like this will comfort me. ""You can do whatever you want. Feast on their bread. Dance in their circuses. Sing sonds and hold hands, or whatever you do when you're pretending that everything is okay. You won't need to get your hands dirty like the rest of us will. When we need help, we'll call on you and our other spies. Do you understand?""

""I won't do it."" I am a terrible fucking liar.

Ever hit that dreaded **afternoon slump** where your brain feels like it’s wading through molasses? 😴 I used to think it was just part of the daily grind... until I stumbled upon something called **diaphragmatic breathing**. Yep, I decided to give it a whirl for a full week, and let me tell you, the results were surprising.

First off, what even is diaphragmatic breathing? Basically, it's breathing *deeply* into your diaphragm instead of just your chest. Sounds simple, right? Turns out, there’s actual science behind it! Studies suggest it can lower stress by reducing cortisol levels – that pesky hormone responsible for our stress responses. 🌬️🧠

So, here’s what happened when I embraced the ""breathe like you mean it"" technique for 7 days:

1. **Day 1: Clumsy Breather**  
   I won’t lie. At first, I felt like a complete newbie trying to control a runaway balloon. But, did you know deep breaths can sometimes sound like your pet snake got hold of a microphone? 😂

2. **Day 3: A Calm Takes Over**  
   By the third day, I noticed a weird thing: my afternoon slump wasn't slumping as hard. It felt like someone had hit the refresh button in my brain. **Coincidence? Maybe.** But I was feeling chill.

3. **Day 5: Breathing Like a Pro**  
   Fast forward a few days, and it became second nature. I was practically a zen master of breath work, channeling my inner yogi. 🙏 Plus, no midday crash in sight!

4. **Day 7: A Whole New Me**  
   The big kicker? I felt more focused and less inclined to indulge in my usual 3 PM coffee scramble. Suddenly, the office coffee pot was more of a nostalgic friend than a lifeline.

Ever thought such a small change could be so liberating? It's a handy tool in our often chaotic lives. If you're on the fence, maybe give it a try. It’s like giving yourself a little high-five with each breath. 😊

Have any of you experimented with this or anything similar? I’d love to hear your stories, mishaps, or even new techniques to tackle that mid-afternoon crash. Let's share and keep the motivation train rolling! 🚂✨

1) I accepted a date with someone I met IRL for Saturday (1 week after meeting IRL). He called me the Tuesday before our set date. I assumed it was regarding the plans (because why else? We just met…barely) but it was 5 min of complete awkwardness as I patiently responded to small-talk questions waiting for him to get to the point of why he called. I guessed maybe he wanted to make sure I was still on board and assured him I’m looking forward to our plans to help him along. He replied in kind, so I thanked him for checking in and ended the call. He did it again two days later! Again, I gave plenty of space for him to get to the point as to the purpose of the call, but he didn’t, so I confirmed where we would meet etc. I relayed to my friends the sort of awkward calls, assuming he must be really concerned I’d flake, and they were both like: maybe he was calling…just to talk? 
Me: 🤯 Oooooooooh! 🤦🏻‍♀️ I blamed it on being in middle-of-the-week work mode. At 3 and 4 PM on a Tuesday and Thursday, my brain is still in decision-mode. I’m okay with talking for a bit, but doesn’t it help to align on a time that works on both ends?

2) He asks if I can go on a second date that Wednesday. I was traveling through the following Friday. 

3) The following Saturday (one week after our ONE date), he texted about how it’s a beautiful day to be outside etc. I concurred, it was beautiful indeed. He asked what I’m doing. I relayed that I stopped for a quick bite at <<place>>. He texted that he can probably meet me there within 20-30 min. Ummm…in my mind we were just texting about our day, it was not an invitation to join me. I let him know, sorry I’ll be wrapping up in a few (it’s the truth — I had a packed day and was looking forward to getting the errands done and possibly a little rest after an intense travel week!). I said maybe I’ll catch him later. Later that day he texted that he gets the feeling I might not be as interested in him. Seriously? Because I won’t just throw out the rest of my plans for the day according to his availability? Honestly, I would never invite myself into someone’s day, especially someone I’ve only met twice and gone on one single date with.  It wasn’t even subtle like: “well, let me know if you’d like company”. Fine, moving on…

All this behind me, yesterday I had a call with a completely different person from OLD on the app. It felt easy-breezy and, given that the whole intent is to screen before meeting, I cut to the chase within ~10 min: well I’ve enjoyed our little chat, where would you like to go from here? He said it feels really easy to talk and would like to meet for coffee. Great!  Today o get a chat: he’d like to have another call tomorrow. The first one seemed kind of rushed and he assumes I was just busy. I mean….not exactly but I was not looking  for a deep conversation before we meet either. 

I am very aware that I am the common denominator here. I’m a little confused. Just a few days ago I posted about some people being keen to meet without briefly chatting and a call, and now the ones I actually want to meet want to have lengthy interactions when we barely know each other.

Kind of like how you can sort of describe a person pretty accurately based on the breed of dog they have , or rescue mutt, or if they are a cat or exotics person instead? And favorite things? Like books, colors, foods, movies, etc?

Also, pet tax and signature perfumes in the comments…. I love seeing everyone else’s signature frags! does yours align with your aesthetic and personality?…and honestly I just want to see those precious animals 😻🐶🐸🤣💜💜

My signature perfumes rotated throughout the month and seasons are Legacy Of Petra by Penhaglions , Ambre Sultan by Serge Lutens , Libre Flowers & Flames by YSL, Paradoxe Intense by Prada, La Vie Este Belle l’Elixir by Lancôme , Tangerine Boy by Phlur , Blooming Fire by Orebella , Goddess Intense by Burberry , Vanilla Skin by Phlur, Bianco Latte by Giardini Di Toscana , La Vie Este Belle Vanille Nude by Lancôme , Aqua Allegoria Forte Rosa Palissandro by Guerlain, Libre Absolu Palatine by YSL, Libre Intense by YSL, MMReplica Coffee Break, MMReplica Under The Stars

Goals used give me meaning/direction in life for more than half of my life. But none of them really made me happy in long term. It's almost like a mirage where once you reach there, it vanishes into thin air. 

At this point when I evaluate most of my goals, more than 90% of them are just desires wrapped in disguise. I'm constantly torn apart by the desires which are luring me and the fact that none of the desires in the past have really made me happy. 

Few years ago I came by this quote from Schopenhauer :

It is difficult to find happiness within oneself, but it is impossible to find it anywhere else.

Though I was already in similar path, this sold the deal for me. 

Been doing quite a bit of inner work developed by different psychologists and ethnobotanists. But something which really calmed my inner storms was the talks by Alan watts. I've found myself again and again drifting towards him. Listening to him in the morning while having my coffee really helped improve my mood. 

I'm searching for other personalities to follow. 
Do you find anyone else useful?

That said, I’ve been really struggling on the networking side. I’ve sent out a bunch of LinkedIn DMs and cold emails since two months ago, but barely get any responses or coffee chats.

Just wondering:
	•	What actually worked for you when you were in my shoes?
	•	Any non-LinkedIn/email strategies that helped?

That warm, buttery cloud that snuck under your bedroom door on Saturday mornings, pulling you out of bed like a invisible string? The way your grandma’s flour-dusted hands would let you lick the spoon, even as she said, “Don’t tell your mom”? Or the first time you tried to bake cookies alone, burning the edges black but eating them anyway—because they were yours, messy and lopsided and full of pride? Welcome to r/NostalgicHomeBakingA, where the recipes aren’t just instructions—they’re time machines.​This isn’t a place for perfect pastries with Instagram-worthy swirls (though if you’ve mastered the art of a crackly top on brownies, we’ll beg for your secrets). It’s for the cookies that spread too thin, the cakes with lumpy frosting, and the pies where the crust crumbles more than your resolve to “save a slice for later.” It’s for the recipes scribbled on index cards, smudged with chocolate and coffee stains, that start with “Grammy’s Best” and end with a mysterious “add a pinch of love” (we all know that’s the real secret ingredient).​Share the stories baked into your treats: “Found my mom’s old cookie recipe—she wrote ‘1987: Made these for your 5th birthday, you cried because I used raisins instead of chocolate chips’ in the margin. Baked them today… still prefer chocolate chips, but they tasted like her.” Laugh at the mishaps: “Tried to make my nana’s yeast bread. Forgot to proof the yeast. It’s now a brick. Named it ‘rustic doorstop with a hint of regret.’” Celebrate the small, sweet moments: “Baked sugar cookies using my childhood rolling pin—same one I used to ‘help’ my dad with every Christmas. The edges are uneven, but my kid licked the frosting off the spatula just like I did. Full circle, huh?”​We get it. Nostalgic baking is equal parts comfort and chaos. Like the time you tried to recreate your aunt’s famous apple pie, only to realize she “eyeballed” the spices and you overdid the cinnamon (now it tastes like a campfire). Or when you burned the birthday cake but covered it with so much frosting, no one noticed—except you, who smiled through the first bite knowing it was made with the same love as the one from your 10th birthday.​Grab your mixing bowl (and maybe a tissue, because some recipes hit right in the heart). Let’s swap tales of lumpy batter, oven mitts that smell like vanilla, and the way a warm slice of bread can turn a bad day into a memory you’ll laugh about later. Here, the messier the bake, the richer the story. Because in the end, it’s not about perfect pastries—it’s about the way a single bite can take you back to a kitchen, a person, a moment, and make you feel like you’re home.",1,1753761067.0,NostalgicHomeBakingA,0,1.0,False

1mc19de,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mc19de/should_i_go_back/,Should I go back?,"Went to ask out the cute hostess at the restaurant I was playing piano at, and got intercepted by a waiter asking about and complimenting me on my playing.  She got sent home early while he was chatting me up.
I dont currently have anytning else booked there for me to be there naturally. Only option is a possible gig there on Aug 15.

Should I go back specifically to ask her out?
My fear is that if I dont act soon, she could have partnered by then, or maybe its just a summer job and she wont be working there in mid Aug. 

I'm also worried about going there specifically to ask her out would be too intense or overwhelming, as well as potentially putting her in an awkward spot in front of her coworkers. 

Context- It seems like shes been making eyes at me over the course of a few weeks now, and when we locked eyes on Sat night she gave me a big smile. I introduced myself to her on Sat night and she said something like ""Its good to (actually, or finally) meet you"". Planned to ask her to coffee on my break,  or when I get my check after my gig.

1mc18tw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mc18tw,Stop Wasting Money. This Is the Ultimate Guide to a Lean Startup and Explosive Growth.,"So, you have a brilliant business idea, a fire in your belly, and a work ethic that could power a small city. The only thing you *don't* have is a mountain of cash in the bank. Welcome to the club. Most of us start here, staring at a massive dream and a minuscule budget. The prevailing myth is that you need significant capital to build a successful business. You need investors, big loans, and a flashy office.

I’m here to tell you that’s not just wrong - it’s a mindset that can actively harm your business in the long run.

Operating on a **shoestring budget** isn’t a curse; it’s a competitive advantage in disguise. It forces you to be smarter, more creative, and more connected to your customers than your well-funded competitors. It compels you to build a business that is lean, agile, and fundamentally profitable from the ground up. This isn’t just about survival; this is the art of **bootstrapping** your way to the top.

This guide is your new playbook. We’re going to dismantle the myth that money equals growth and show you how to turn your financial constraints into your greatest strength.

# The Lean Mindset: Your Most Valuable Asset

Before we talk about tactics and tools, we need to start with the most critical component of **growth on a budget**: your mindset. A fat bank account can make you lazy. It allows you to throw money at problems instead of thinking your way through them. A shoestring budget, however, demands ingenuity.

**Embrace Constraint-Driven Innovation:** When you can't afford the industry-standard software, you find a free alternative or build a clever spreadsheet. When you can't hire a marketing agency, you learn the art of guerrilla marketing. Constraints are not limitations; they are the mother of innovation. Your best ideas will come from figuring out how to get from A to B without the resources everyone else takes for granted.

**Become a Master of Resourcefulness:** The shoestring entrepreneur thinks like a Swiss Army knife. Every tool, every relationship, every piece of content has multiple uses. That blog post you wrote? It’s also a script for a YouTube video, a series of tweets, a section of your next email newsletter, and a chapter in a future e-book. Every customer conversation is a source of testimonials, product ideas, and market research.

**Fall in Love with ‘Good Enough’:** Perfectionism is the enemy of the bootstrapped founder. You don’t have the time or money to build the perfect, feature-loaded product before you launch. This is the core principle of the **lean startup** methodology. You create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)—the simplest version of your idea that solves a core problem for a customer. You launch it, get real-world feedback, iterate, and improve. This cycle of building, measuring, and learning saves you from wasting thousands of dollars developing something nobody wants.

# Strategic Financial Planning: The Art of the Tactical Dollar

When you have limited funds, every single dollar is an employee. You must assign it a job, and it must deliver a return. This requires a ruthless and strategic approach to budgeting.

# 1. Create a Bare-Bones Budget

Forget complex accounting software for a moment. Open a simple spreadsheet and list two things:

* **Fixed Costs:** The absolute, must-pay expenses to keep the lights on (e.g., web hosting, essential software subscriptions, legal registration fees).
* **Variable Costs:** Expenses that fluctuate, often with sales or marketing efforts (e.g., cost of goods sold, transaction fees, ad spend).

Your goal is to get your fixed costs as close to zero as humanly possible. Can you work from home instead of an office? Can you use free software instead of paid subscriptions? Challenge every single line item.

# 2. Prioritize Spending with the ""Growth Test""

For every potential expense, ask yourself one question: **""Will this dollar directly contribute to revenue or customer acquisition?""**

* **Buying a new, expensive laptop?** Unlikely to pass the test unless your current one is literally on fire.
* **Investing $50 in a targeted social media ad campaign that could reach 10,000 potential customers?** That passes the test.
* **Ordering fancy business cards?** Fail. A simple, clean design from a budget printer does the same job.
* **Spending $100 to attend a local industry networking event where your ideal clients congregate?** Pass. The potential for new business is high.

This ruthless prioritization ensures your money is only spent on activities that move the needle.

# 3. Track Everything. No, Everything.

You must become obsessed with your numbers. Use a free tool like Wave or even your spreadsheet to track every cent coming in and going out. This isn’t just about accounting; it’s about data. When you see that you spent $200 on coffee meetings last month, you might realize that switching to video calls could fund your entire email marketing platform for a year. Financial clarity empowers smart decisions.

# Marketing and Sales for (Almost) Free

This is where the shoestring entrepreneur truly shines. You can’t outspend your competition, so you must out-think, out-hustle, and out-care them.

# 1. Content Marketing is Your Engine

Content is the ultimate currency for **growth on a budget**. It builds trust, demonstrates expertise, attracts your target audience through search engines, and gives you something valuable to share on social media.

* **Start a Blog:** Write detailed, helpful articles that answer the most pressing questions your ideal customers are asking. Use free tools like Google Keyword Planner to find out what they’re searching for. A single, high-quality blog post can bring in organic traffic for years.
* **Guest Post:** Write for other blogs in your industry. This gets you in front of a new, relevant audience and builds valuable backlinks to your website, boosting your own SEO.
* **Create Simple Videos:** You don’t need a film studio. Use your smartphone to record product demos, how-to guides, or behind-the-scenes looks at your business. Post them on YouTube and embed them in your blog posts.

**Pro Tip:** Create one ""pillar"" piece of content—a massive, ultimate guide like this one—and then break it down into dozens of smaller pieces of content (micro-videos, infographics, social media posts) to distribute everywhere.

# 2. Master the Art of Social Media (Without Ads)

Don't try to be on every platform. Find out where your customers spend their time and dominate one or two channels.

* **Provide Value, Don't Just Pitch:** Your feed should be 80% helpful, entertaining, or educational content and only 20% promotional. Share tips, ask questions, and engage in conversations.
* **Join Niche Communities:** Find Facebook Groups, LinkedIn Groups, or Reddit subreddits where your audience hangs out. Don't spam them with links. Become a valuable member of the community by answering questions and offering genuine advice. People will naturally become curious about what you do.

# 3. Build an Email List from Day One

Your email list is one of the only marketing channels you truly own. It’s a direct line to your most engaged followers.

* **Use Freemium Tools:** Services like Mailchimp or MailerLite offer free plans for your first 1,000-2,000 subscribers.
* **Create an Irresistible Opt-in:** Offer something valuable in exchange for an email address. This could be a simple checklist, a short e-book, a discount code, or a free template. Promote it on your website, in your social media bio, and at the end of every blog post.

# 4. Never Underestimate Old-School Networking

Digital marketing is powerful, but human connection is priceless.

* **Attend Local Meetups:** Go to events where your potential clients or partners are. Your goal isn’t to sell; it’s to listen and build genuine relationships.
* **The Power of ""Coffee Meetings"":** Offer to buy a coffee (or schedule a virtual one) for people you admire in your industry. Ask for their story and advice. This can lead to mentorship, partnerships, and referrals down the line.

# Lean Operations: Slashing Overhead Without Sacrificing Quality

A lean business isn't just about cheap marketing; it's about operational efficiency.

# 1. The Freemium Software Stack

For almost every expensive software, there is a free or ""freemium"" alternative that is more than good enough when you're starting out.

* **Project Management:** Trello, Asana, ClickUp
* **Communication:** Slack, Google Meet
* **Design:** Canva, Figma
* **CRM (Customer Relationship Management):** HubSpot Free CRM, Zoho CRM
* **Website:** [WordPress.org](http://WordPress.org) (you pay for hosting, but the software is free and infinitely customizable)

Build your operational stack with these tools first. You can always upgrade as revenue grows.

# 2. The Art of the Barter

Don't have cash? You have skills. Bartering is a powerful tool for early-stage entrepreneurs.

* Are you a great writer? Offer to write blog posts for a web developer in exchange for help with your site.
* Are you a social media whiz? Offer to manage the Instagram account for a local photographer in exchange for professional headshots and product photos.

This creates a win-win scenario and keeps precious cash in the bank.

# 3. Automate the Small Stuff

Time is your most valuable non-renewable resource. Use free automation tools like Zapier or IFTTT to handle repetitive tasks.

* Automatically save email attachments to Google Drive.
* Get a Slack notification for new sales.
* Cross-post your new blog articles to your social media channels.

Each automated task saves you a few minutes, which adds up to hours you can reinvest in growth-focused activities.

# Scaling Smart: Reinvesting for Sustainable Growth

**Bootstrapping** doesn't mean staying small forever. It means building a solid foundation so you can scale intelligently.

Once the revenue starts trickling in, the temptation is to relax and increase your lifestyle spending. This is a critical mistake. Your first profits are your most powerful growth fuel.

* **Reinvest in What Works:** Look at your data. Is that $50 social media ad campaign delivering customers at a profitable rate? Double down. Reinvest your profits into the channels that are already proven to work.
* **Hire for Your Weaknesses:** As a founder, you do everything at first. But you're not an expert at everything. Your first hire shouldn't be an assistant; it should be someone who can take over your biggest weakness (e.g., bookkeeping, technical support), freeing you up to focus on your strengths (e.g., sales, product vision). Consider hiring freelancers or contractors before committing to a full-time employee.
* **Know When to Seek Funding (If Ever):** The beauty of building a lean, profitable business is that you get to decide your own destiny. You may reach a point where a strategic injection of cash could dramatically accelerate your growth. But because you built your business on a **shoestring budget**, you'll be negotiating from a position of strength, not desperation. You won't need the money to survive; you'll use it to dominate.

# Your Journey Starts Now

Growing a business with limited funds is a marathon, not a sprint. It’s a journey of relentless learning, creative problem-solving, and unwavering belief in the value you provide. Embrace the constraints. Celebrate the small wins. Stay connected to your customers.

Forget the narrative that you need a huge bankroll. Your resourcefulness, your passion, and your ability to execute a lean strategy are the most valuable forms of capital you will ever have. Now go build your empire.",2,1753760662.0,GrowCashflow,0,1.0,False
1mc17za,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1mc17za/sustainable_fasting/,sustainable fasting,"i have horrific GI issues & am contemplating basically fasting indefinitely because i'm dying from the daily pain & blood loss from eating.

i'm thinking of how i can approach this in a sustainable way, because my GI issues already have caused me to lose a considerable amount pf weight, & i'm on the verge of being underweight...

i also used to have low-iron anemia & sometimes have fainting spells from vasovagal syncope...i cant take iron supplements because they worsen my GI issues, but my guts tolerate one specific brand of organic prenatal multivitamin gummies.

so i'm thinking if i am going to fast for a long time, obviously i will still need vitamins, so i'll take that multi, & i'll drink various fruit juices for the vitamins as well as blood sugar. i will also need electrolytes (which will help prevent fainting), & i have liquidIV, as well as some clear chicken bone broth i could add extra salt to, some spices, & powdered ginger for my guts. i also have various teas i can drink with honey, coffee & maple syrup, etc, so i think i'll be fine in the blood sugar dept. & the bone broth has some protein & such, & i can add more healthy fats to it by adding a spoonful of coconut oil (or adding coconut oil to my coffee).

feasibly, if i can just have the self-discipline to not eat, what would i be lacking, & how could i supplement that? when i was a teenager i used to go on 4-5 day stretches of fasting, mainly because of an ED, but i don't actually want to lose weight this time. i actually felt better about my body before all the weight loss from GI bleeds...

can i sustain a fast healthily though with the liquids i mentioned, & vitamins & supplements?

Any reasonable person would assume that after my last trip to the Appalachian, I would never again make the hike up there. I wish that was the truth. Unlike my last trip, no level of rationalization or familiarity could have brought me back to that place. Unfortunately, something else did. 

I wasn’t sleeping well since the last incident and it was showing at work. I felt lucky to claim 3 or 4 hours of sleep a night. I was less prepared and less sharp during my lectures. I found myself often ending class 15 to 20 minutes early, much to the joy of my high school students who were then free to chat and go on their phones. Two 24 ounce Cuban black coffees a day from Wawa kept my head above water. After the 8th period bell rang, I sat in my room for about half an hour putting in grades before hearing Joe walk in. 

“Alex, dude, let’s grab a beer today this week kicked my ass!” 

It was Friday? I hadn’t realized. I lived alone and basically phoned in the last week, so it wasn’t like I had any plans.

“Sure, man. One drink.”

Joe followed closely behind my car on the 5 minute drive from my school to the local bar. It was a bit of a dive but familiar to any of the faculty at school. Walking in I noticed a few colleagues, a trio of teachers from the math department sat at the bar while one of the ELA teachers sat at a table with the school librarian. Me and Joe sat on two of the open stools at the bar and waved to the math teachers who already seemed buzzed. Joe got a Surf Side and I ordered a Guinness. We talked about some of our mutual problem students until the bartender brought me a cold 20 oz pint with a three inch foam head. I took my first swig and heard the school librarian’s soft voice right behind me.

“You better split that G, Alex!”

She gently slapped my back as I choked on my beer for a second then turned around. Adeline, the librarian laughed at me and put up an apologetic hand. She smiled “Sorry didn’t mean to make it come out your nose.” It was always like this. She’d tease me, and every once in a while we’d have a short chat about Russian lit or something. 

“No problem Addie, you probably just couldn’t see me through those coke bottle glasses.”

She smiled and pushed up her cartoonishly thick glasses with an index finger. She took a stool next to me and Joe. 

“You want to tell me why you were bugging out on Monday and basically cleaned out the library's entire stock of history books on Native American history?” 

My face turned white. “I’ve got a big project planned for the end of this marking period, just gotta do some brushing up.”

Adeline looked at me “That would make sense if it was September and you were still teaching unit one on pre-Columbian North America.”

Joe stood up “I’m gonna hit the bathroom you guys!” He winked at me on his way out, probably imagining himself as the world's greatest wingman.

Adeline looked at me more seriously now, “Alex, don’t take this the wrong way, but you don’t seem like you’ve been doing well these past couple weeks. I mean I’ve hardly seen you around the library aside from that once, and you used to come a lot more often…” she trailed off. Adeline had never been so direct with me, our conversations rarely veered too far from the surface level, this was different. 

“I’m fine... I’ll be honest I’m not doing great, there's just some bull shit I’m dealing with outside of school.”

She put her hand over mine on the bar, “for what it’s worth you can talk to me.”

I’d had a few hook ups in the last couple years, but Addie seemed different. It’s probably why I was hesitant to ask her out, but I did trust her and decided I’d take a chance. Maybe she would think I was totally crazy, but I needed to tell someone about all of this on a personal level.

“Thank you, seriously. Let’s meet for coffee tomorrow?”

She smiled and said “Yeah sounds good, just don’t bring Joe ‘Shmoe’ this time.” As she walked back over to her table with the ELA teacher, Joe came back from the bathroom right on cue. We talked a bit more, I covered the tab and headed out to my car. I was finally completely exhausted. After all of my trouble sleeping this week, setting up a coffee date with Addie somehow got my mind off the Appalachian Trail. I parked my car and walked up to my one-bedroom studio apartment. Completely wiped out, I didn’t even bother to change into pajamas and just crashed on my bed, falling into a deep, dreamless sleep with a smile on my face. 

I woke up 6 hours later to the sound of five consecutive whacks. Gripping at the damp soil around me, I was covered by the pitch black silence of remote mountainous woods. Somehow, in my sleep, I was back on the Appalachian Trail.

Night Three:

As an outdoorsman I felt prepared for this situation, but as a rational person who was increasingly becoming aware of the existence of the supernatural, I was losing my mind. Was I losing my mind? Was all of this just the onset of some severe hallucinogenic mental illness? The answers to these questions needed to wait.

I focused on the task at hand, assessing my surroundings and trying to get a bearing on where I was in the dark. I pulled out my phone, no service, but I flipped on the flashlight. Nothing was distinguishable about the surrounding woods aside from a boulder and a single white square on a tree about ten feet away from me confirming what I already knew, I was on the Appalachian Trail. With only my buck knife and the clothes on my back, I got to work on a makeshift shelter, propping sticks up against the boulder. It was hard going but managed to set up a half decent shelter with some moss and leaves over the branches offering possible relief from any rain.

 As I crawled into the shelter, my phone's battery percentage dwindled to 1. It was then that I heard the five whacks again. I flashed my light in the direction of the sound. The whacks sounded about a hundred yards away so I jumped when I saw a nude, four-foot, pale blue figure standing outside my shelter. It opened its mouth and produced the faded whacking noise that deceptively appeared to be much further. With each whack its throat bulged and on the fifth one, my phone battery died. I heard its quick shuffling of feet and pulled out my buck knife. I could hear it breathing right next to me, just waiting. I was hesitant to strike. What if these things were harmless? It started sniffing in short deep bursts like a dog before it struck out at my arm and latched on with what must have been a hundred small sandpaper-like teeth. I screamed and stabbed at its neck with my knife. It ripped into my arm deeper still, latching on and now growling viciously. I stabbed again and again at its neck, catching on some strange bone where its Adam's apple should be. I dropped my knife and grabbed the bone in its neck, ripping with all my might and pulling it out with a sick crunch. The creature dropped dead. I kicked its corpse out of my shelter and waited hyperventilating.

The three hours I spent keeping watch from my shelter felt like three years before the first crack of dawn broke. I needed no further incentive to get moving. The excitement and adrenaline from the night was wearing off and I suddenly realized how much colder I felt. After my third quarter mile, I finally had a view beyond the canopy of trees in the morning light. I could see the White Mountains.

We weren’t engaged yet, still just dating. When we were in the rough patch, he was gambling 4-5 times a week and would be gone all night, he told me he wasn’t sure about marriage with me anymore, I felt like I was not getting nearly enough attention and affection from him and his response was basically, “I’m doing what I can so if it’s not enough for you then maybe I just can’t meet your needs”, and I genuinely thought there was a good chance that we were going to break up. I was spiraling one night thinking how am I going to be single again, scared of being alone, and almost like I needed to “prepare” to become single again. I have anxiety, OCD, and ADHD if this adds any context. 

Out of curiosity I went on the App Store and was browsing dating apps. I wanted to see if there was anything out there besides basic things like Tinder/bumble, etc. I came across one called “Coffee meets Bagel” and I thought oh this sounds interesting/wholesome, I love coffee and bagels! And i downloaded the app onto my phone. I opened the app and went on to it and I of course was being prompted to make a profile, and that is when I was like ok wtf am I doing, this is not me, this is bad, and I did NOT make a profile, and I deleted the app. So I did not even make a profile, I didn’t see anyone else’s profile, didn’t talk to anyone, etc, and quickly deleted the app however I feel like an absolutely terrible partner now.

My partner and I made it through that rough patch and he proposed to me a few months ago so now we are engaged and supposed to be planning a wedding but I feel like I am hiding this huge secret from him. I love him so much and I have never wanted another man in any way, have never sent bad messages to someone else, or anything. So why did I put a dating app on my phone. What would my fiancé think if he knew I put a dating app on my phone during a rough time? Is this something he “deserves to know”? I know confessing is a compulsion but what if I broke trust and the only way to have a fully honest relationship is to tell my partner what I did? What should I do?

Part 1

Ok. Context. I am a huge cosmic horror nerd, and one night when some buddies and I were partying we decided to try shrooms. ""Yeah, bad idea buddy"", you might say, or ""Right on bro"". Honestly? Happiest day of my life. Because during our trip we looked up random summoning rituals to try as a joke on the dark web, and some crazy shit happened that changed us all forever. Eric, who was our shroom guy that day and since, got possessed by a demon named Germaine and the two are to this day best friends. They started a podcast awhile back, where they interview spirits and psychics, it's pretty neat. Jillian, my sister and our party host, attuned her mortal soul to a plastic spork, and will die the moment she lets go of it. Pretty fucked, except it helped her find her soulmate. Gripping a marinara stained spork at a coffee bar is a fantastic conversation starter it turns out. Mel, the guy who found the rituals online, got a rock. A pet rock. It eats sunlight, Cool Whip, and dreams. Mel named it Pebbs. And then there's me, Jeb. I got the best gift of all, an eternal pact with an eldritch being named Fhytuviokjlio-Ontvdisdeqe, at least that's how it's spelled and pronounced in English. I just call her Fae, like the fae from celtic and arthurian legends. Because even though she looks like a heap of tentacles and claws dumped onto the legs of some proto-equine beast, to me she is like the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio. Her croaks and screeches and gagging are like silky sweet music to me.

She had appeared from the sigil we had all drawn on the floor, and she fixed her gaze at me. Everybody else screamed, but I just sighed contentedly. She was perfect, and I let her know that. She told me the same, just in a way that pierced my mind and thundered in my skull, making me convulse and foam like an epileptic. I guess the human mind really can't comprehend cosmic beings beyond a certain point, huh? But the message was received, and when I recovered I was smitten. I pledged my undying fealty to her, and I became her loyal consort eternal. That was our first official date. Germaine saw how I literally fell for Fae, so he decided to leave with Eric the same way. It was the most majestic and terrifying thing I had ever seen Eric do. Mel took his new pet upstairs and Jillian slowly realized that her life was now the spork, and the spork was now her life. I crashed at my sister's place, and Fae took me home. Protip, dimensional rifts should NEVER be travelled while high or drunk. Just trust me.

My first morning as her consort involved gathering small animals for ritual sacrifice. I told her I didn't have any pets or pests, so she told me to conjure some, obviously I had no trouble conjuring her. Her words were long and drawn out, like a thousand tiny mouths struggling to synchronize in order to form words thousands of dimensions lower than their capability. It was heaven to me. 

""Only the most capable and loft of sorcerers could ever dream of summoning an elder god, especially the Queen of the Abyssal Depths""

I blushed in embarrassment. If I told her I couldn't she would kill me for sure, or worse, dump me. But I knew there was no use lying to a cosmic being so I fessed up.

""Babe I was only able to conjure you with the others' help, plus we were all high as fuck and I only remember the crazy shit from last night, the really crazy shit"", I sheepishly admitted.

Fae paused. She slithered her upper half and tapped one of her hooved feet impatiently. 

""Consort, if you speak true, then I suppose you must find my sacrifices another way""

I beamed and hugged her. She jolted and started to back away from me, but I held on. She wrapped her tendrils and claws and tentacles around me, and we embraced.

""I'll get what you need Fae, I promise""

I let go and slime had pasted my clothes and face. I didn't mind though. I went to the pet store to buy all the guinea pigs I could. Everyone in the store looked at me in confusion and disgust from the sludge covering me. Then they all gagged and vomited and tripped their way out onto the sidewalk. I guess I stunk pretty bad, but I didn't smell anything. A few got hit by a speeding truck passing through, but I had an errand to run for my new girlfriend so I ignored it. Since the shop was empty of even the staff, I strolled out with all the guinea pigs I could carry.

When I got home I found Fae on my couch. She was staring at my tv with the screen turned off. I tried to turn it on but she gently stopped me with one of her big meaty claws.

""Trying to watch.....sit with me"", she murmured.

""Um.....ok"" I shrugged. 

She probably tuned into streaming or cable with her mind. Or she just really loved staring at the glass surface. Either way, I sat beside her.

""Closer...."" she hissed.

I was practically engulfed by her endless tendrils, but I sidled closer. I felt millions of tiny cilia tickle me.

""Hmmmmm.....like this""

She forced me onto her bristly lap, and she wrapped my legs in her tendrils. I heard a deep, guttural humming and clicking churning in her belly. It made me feel frightened beyond belief, but I also felt content. I felt safe. I felt wanted, and loved. It was weird that earlier she was so hesitant at my hug, and now she invited m to lay on her lap. Usually I would be concerned, but Fae wasn't like other girls. I paid no mind and enjoyed the moment. Then the guinea pigs chewed through their boxes and scurried around my living room floor. I heard Fae hiss and growl, and my mind felt like fire. I shuddered as space bent around me, and she sucked the souls of every guinea pig into herself. I babbled nonsense and riddles from the starry void, praising the Queen of the Abyssal Depths, praising Fhytuviokjlio-Ontvdisdeqe. Then I fell back on her lap, the ritual sacrifice complete.

""Very good, consort""

She stroked my cheek, and I looked up into her tentacled mass. 

""Fae....can you call me something beside consort?""

Fae lifted me up, as if cradling me.

""Will slave suffice?"" she asked murmuringly.

""Uh, no that's not what I meant""

""Mortal then?""

""No, I....."" I trail off.

I was embarassed. She knew that. She drew me close.

""Tell me dearest consort. We are each other's now""

I hug her, feeling her humanesque parts push against me.

""Can you call me.....your good boy?""

Fae paused, as if taken aback. She didn't seem to understand why I would need or want to be called that. But, regardless, she held me up to her and cooed with all the gut-wrenching symphonies she could conjure from her multi-faceted vocal organs, ""Very well....my good boy...""

That if you gave someone your heart, if you showed up for them — fully, wholly, without conditions — they’d never hurt you.  
I really believed that.

I met Daniel when I was 24. He was charming in that effortless, quiet way. He listened more than he spoke, made you feel like you were the only one in the room. The kind of man who pulled out chairs and remembered how you take your coffee. Vanilla oat milk, no sugar. Always.

For years, I truly thought I had everything.  
We traveled. We laughed. We built a little life filled with rituals — Sunday pancakes, movie nights on Fridays, hand-written notes slipped into lunch bags. I was the kind of woman who believed in partnership. In showing up when it’s boring. In holding hands even after the honeymoon phase.

And I thought he felt the same.

But love doesn't vanish in a thunderclap.  
It fades in whispers.  
Late meetings.  
Missed calls.  
A strange new password on his phone.

It started slowly — like a fog creeping in through the cracks.  
He’d come home tired, sighing like the world was too much. I’d rub his shoulders, pour him a drink, ask how his day was. And he’d smile… but it never reached his eyes anymore.

“I’m just slammed with work,” he’d say. “It’s nothing.”

Except it *was* something.  
It became everything.  
His phone started living face-down.  
His cologne lingered when he walked in, but not the kind I bought him.  
And sometimes, he’d come home freshly showered — claiming the office gym had better water pressure.

I wanted to believe him. God, I *tried*.  
Because the alternative felt like suffocating under my own skin.  
But the silence in our apartment grew louder.  
His eyes stopped searching for mine across the room.

And still, I clung to hope like it was oxygen.

Until that Thursday night.

He texted me around 6:45 — “Work running late. Don’t wait up.”

Just like that.

And something in me broke.  
Not because of the words.  
But because I *already knew*.

I sat on the couch for nearly fifteen minutes.  
Just... breathing.  
Not crying. Not yet.  
Just staring at the message.  
Reading it over and over like maybe it would rearrange itself into something more innocent.

But it didn’t.

So I did something I’d never done before.  
I followed my gut.

I didn’t text back.  
I didn’t call.  
I didn’t yell or scream or panic.

I got up.  
Changed into jeans.  
Tied my hair into a low bun.  
And drove.

Not fast. Not recklessly.  
Just steady. Like I already knew where I was going.

And I did.

There’s a boutique hotel just ten minutes from his office — sleek, minimal, dimly lit — the kind you’d book if you didn’t want to be recognized.  
I don’t even remember how I knew about it. Maybe something he’d said once. Maybe my intuition just screamed *there*.

I pulled into the parking garage, heart pounding so loud I could barely hear my own thoughts.  
Walked in through the side entrance.  
And at the front desk, I smiled politely and said I’d like to leave a surprise for my husband in room 412.  
Room 412.  
I hadn’t even known for sure he was there, but when the receptionist smiled back and said, “Of course, Mrs. Wells,” it was like the entire universe confirmed what I had refused to believe.

I thanked her.  
Took the key card.  
And made my way to the elevator.

Each floor ding echoed like a countdown in my chest.

When I reached the door, I didn’t hesitate.  
I tapped the card.  
Opened it.

And there they were.  
Him.  
And her.

Half-dressed.  
Frozen like deer in headlights.

His eyes met mine — wide, horrified, pleading.  
Hers darted between us like she wanted to vanish.

And I?  
I didn’t scream.  
Didn’t cry.  
Didn’t throw anything.

I just stood there.  
Quiet.  
Still.  
And smiled.

Because in that moment, everything became *crystal clear*.[Full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8cjtbfw-P0)",2,1753760034.0,stories,1,1.0,False

How do I go on?","In the past month, I got fired from my dream job, found out my boyfriend of 4 years had been cheating on me with multiple people for the first 2 years of our relationship and now I can’t afford rent or stay where I live. 

I’ve worked in my industry for almost a decade, I entered into this company with such high hopes and plans. Before I started, I did see that they only extremely negative glass door reviews. Over 50 of them pleading for people to not work there. My industry is quite small and this company is one of the leaders in the industry. I thought it was worth at least trying even if it did turn out a bit toxic.  In my two months there, I was screamed at, blamed for things that weren’t my fault, I experienced real work place sexism and I was expected to work 5am to 5pm everyday, even weekend, no extra pay. I got fired because I asked for some help on a Sunday to get some work done as I had to go see family. They said I wasn’t a team player and that the previous person always was able to get the expected work done. They were asking me to work my Sunday with no pay as well. I got fired the next day. 

I found out my boyfriend had been cheating on me for the first two years of our relationship the same month that all of the work drama came to a head. He cheated with 5 random women and his ex, he slept with her throughout the first year of our relationship. I immediately grabbed my stuff and went to stay with a friend for a few weeks. I had plans to not go back to him however, I got fired. I do have a little bit of savings however not enough to pay my rent for more than a few weeks. I’ve been desperately trying to find another job.

This part is an ego thing I know and I won’t let my ego get in the way but as I need to find my own place quickly I will probably have to find a causal coffee job. I’ve been in my very specific industry for 10 years. It is an artistic role and very specialised, I will have to let my ego go but it’s hard to not feel so sad about all the progress I’ve made over the past 10 years to just end me in a coffee job. I can obviously get a job in my industry again but they are quite hard to catch and is going to take me a few months (unless I get lucky).

The final saddest part for me is I love the home I lived in with my ex. I’ve lived in that home for almost 7 years with my best friends. It’s been my home and entire life and comfort. Unfortunately I don’t have much support from my family so i cannot rely on them. My ex actually has offered to move out and let me stay but I can no longer afford the rent, especially without him.

I should have cut him off by now but this job situation has shaken me to my core.

I’m mostly just looking for any one who might have been through similar life crashing changes and got through the other side. Ive been trying so hard to keep myself busy, alive and working but it’s so hard to not be absolutely depressed. How can I get through this with a positive outlook? 


y in my field, but I’m struggling with no income, no safe home (still stuck at my ex’s place), and no family I can turn to. I want to keep going, but the rejection from a job I loved has shaken my confidence more than anything. How do I find the energy to keep going?

1mc0y7j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mc0y7j,The Broke Entrepreneur’s Playbook: How to Achieve Massive Growth While Bootstrapping,"Let's be honest: Most of us didn't start our businesses with a trust fund or venture capital backing. We started with a dream, determination, and maybe enough cash to cover a few months of ramen noodles. If that sounds like you, you're in good company.

Some of today's biggest companies started on a shoestring budget. Sara Blakely cut the feet off her pantyhose and turned $5,000 into Spanx, now worth over a billion dollars. Nick Woodman strapped a 35mm camera to his wrist with rubber bands, leading to GoPro. Even tech giants like Apple and Microsoft began in garages with more ambition than capital.

The truth is, having limited funds might actually be your secret weapon. It forces you to be creative, scrappy, and laser-focused on what truly matters: creating value for your customers. This guide will show you exactly how to leverage your constraints into competitive advantages and grow your business without breaking the bank.

# The Shoestring Budget Mindset: Your First (Free) Asset

Before we dive into tactics, let's talk about the most powerful tool in your arsenal—your mindset. When you're bootstrapping, every dollar counts, but more importantly, every decision counts. This constraint breeds innovation.

Think of your limited budget as a filter. It forces you to ask critical questions: ""Do I really need this?"" ""What's the cheapest way to test this idea?"" ""How can I get this done without spending money?"" These questions lead to breakthrough solutions that well-funded competitors might never discover because they can simply throw money at problems.

I once met a bakery owner who couldn't afford traditional advertising. Instead of seeing this as a limitation, she started a ""pay-it-forward"" coffee program where customers could buy an extra coffee for someone in need. The local news picked up the story, giving her more publicity than she could have ever bought. That's the shoestring budget mindset in action—turning constraints into opportunities.

# Starting Smart: The Lean Startup Approach

The lean startup methodology isn't just for tech companies—it's perfect for any business operating on a shoestring budget. The core principle is simple: Build, Measure, Learn, and repeat as quickly and cheaply as possible.

Instead of spending months perfecting your product or service, launch a minimum viable product (MVP). This doesn't mean releasing something terrible; it means releasing something simple that solves one specific problem well. You can always add features later based on actual customer feedback rather than assumptions.

For example, if you're starting a meal prep service, don't invest in a commercial kitchen and delivery fleet right away. Start by preparing meals in your home kitchen (following local regulations) and personally delivering to your first 10 customers. Use their feedback to refine your recipes and service before scaling up.

# The Art of Bootstrapping: Making Every Dollar Work Overtime

Bootstrapping is about being resourceful, not cheap. It's about finding creative ways to achieve your goals without traditional funding. Here are proven strategies that work:

**1. Barter and Trade** Your skills and services have value beyond cash. A web designer I know traded website work for six months of accounting services. Another entrepreneur exchanged social media management for office space. Look at what you need and what you can offer—you'll be surprised at the deals you can make.

**2. Leverage Free and Low-Cost Tools** Gone are the days when you needed expensive software to run a business. Use Google Workspace for collaboration, Canva for design, Mailchimp for email marketing (free up to 2,000 contacts), and Wave for accounting. These tools can replace thousands of dollars in traditional software costs.

**3. The Power of Pre-Sales** Need cash to produce your product? Sell it first. Crowdfunding, pre-orders, and deposits can fund your initial inventory. A jewelry maker I coached pre-sold her holiday collection in July, using the funds to buy materials and create the pieces for December delivery.

# Marketing Magic: Big Impact on a Tiny Budget

Marketing doesn't have to be expensive to be effective. In fact, some of the most powerful marketing strategies cost nothing but time and creativity.

**Content Marketing: Your 24/7 Salesperson** Creating valuable content establishes you as an expert and attracts customers organically. Start a blog answering common questions in your industry. Share behind-the-scenes videos on social media. Write detailed how-to guides that showcase your expertise. This content works for you around the clock, bringing in leads while you sleep.

A landscape designer I know started a YouTube channel showing DIY garden tips. While giving away free advice might seem counterintuitive, it established him as the go-to expert. When viewers wanted professional help, guess who they called?

**Guerrilla Marketing Tactics** Think outside the traditional advertising box. Leave creative business cards in strategic locations. Partner with complementary businesses for cross-promotion. Create shareable, memorable experiences that get people talking.

One food truck owner created a ""secret menu"" that was only shared through word-of-mouth and social media. The exclusivity created buzz and lines around the block—all for the cost of printing a few special menu items.

**Harnessing Social Proof** Customer testimonials, reviews, and case studies are marketing gold—and they're free. Make it easy for happy customers to share their experiences. Feature their stories prominently. A single powerful testimonial can be worth more than a expensive ad campaign.

# Strategic Partnerships: Multiply Your Resources

When you're operating on a shoestring budget, partnerships can exponentially expand your reach and resources. Look for businesses that serve your target market but aren't direct competitors.

A personal trainer partnered with a local healthy meal prep service. They offered package deals to their combined customer base, sharing marketing costs and increasing value for clients. Both businesses grew without increasing their individual marketing budgets.

Consider these partnership opportunities:

* Cross-promotion with complementary businesses
* Referral agreements with related service providers
* Bundled offerings that create more value
* Shared resources like equipment or workspace
* Joint marketing initiatives

# The Customer-Funded Growth Model

Your customers can be your best source of growth capital. Here's how to leverage customer funding:

**1. Subscription Models** Even if you're not a traditional subscription business, consider how you could create recurring revenue. A lawn care service offers seasonal packages paid upfront. A consultant creates a monthly retainer program. These models provide predictable cash flow and fund growth.

**2. Customer Loyalty Programs** Reward repeat business with points, discounts, or exclusive perks. The cost of retaining a customer is always less than acquiring a new one. A coffee shop that gives every 10th coffee free ensures customers keep coming back, providing steady revenue.

**3. Turn Customers into Advocates** Implement a referral program that rewards customers for bringing in new business. Dropbox grew from 100,000 to 4 million users in 15 months primarily through their referral program—offering extra storage for each friend who signed up.

# Managing Cash Flow Like a Pro

Cash flow is the lifeblood of any business, but it's especially critical when you're bootstrapping. Here's how to master it:

**Speed Up Income:**

* Invoice immediately upon delivery
* Offer discounts for early payment
* Require deposits for large projects
* Consider factoring for immediate cash

**Slow Down Expenses:**

* Negotiate payment terms with suppliers
* Take advantage of net-30 or net-60 terms
* Lease equipment instead of buying
* Pay with credit cards that offer rewards (but pay them off monthly)

A contractor I know transformed his business by requiring 50% deposits and offering 2% discounts for payment within 10 days. This simple change eliminated his cash flow problems within two months.

# Common Shoestring Budget Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them)

**1. Being Penny Wise, Pound Foolish** Don't sacrifice quality for small savings. Buying the cheapest equipment that breaks constantly costs more than investing in reliable tools. Focus on value, not just price.

**2. Trying to Do Everything Yourself** Your time has value. Calculate your hourly worth and outsource tasks that can be done cheaper by others. A virtual assistant for $15/hour frees you to focus on $100/hour activities.

**3. Ignoring Legal and Financial Basics** Skipping proper business registration, insurance, or basic contracts to save money can cost you everything. These are investments, not expenses. Many cities offer free legal clinics for small businesses—use them.

**4. Undervaluing Your Offerings** Competing on price alone is a race to the bottom. Even on a shoestring budget, focus on value. Better to have fewer customers paying fair prices than many customers paying unsustainable rates.

# Scaling Smartly: Growing Without Growing Broke

As your business gains traction, resist the urge to scale too quickly. Sustainable growth on a shoestring budget means:

**Reinvest Strategically** Put profits back into areas that directly drive growth. If content marketing is bringing in customers, invest in better content. If a particular product is selling well, expand that line before diversifying.

**Test Before You Invest** Before making any significant investment, run small tests. Want to expand to a new market? Start with a small pilot program. Considering new equipment? Rent it first to ensure it delivers the expected ROI.

**Build Systems Early** Document your processes while they're simple. Create templates, checklists, and standard operating procedures. These systems allow you to scale efficiently without proportionally increasing costs.

# Your Shoestring Success Action Plan

Here's your roadmap to growth on a budget:

1. **Week 1-2:** Audit your current spending. Cut anything that doesn't directly contribute to revenue or customer satisfaction.
2. **Week 3-4:** Implement three free marketing strategies: start content creation, set up social media presence, and begin collecting customer testimonials.
3. **Month 2:** Launch a customer referral program and explore one strategic partnership opportunity.
4. **Month 3:** Test a new revenue stream—whether it's pre-sales, subscriptions, or a complementary service.
5. **Ongoing:** Track everything. Know your numbers. Reinvest profits strategically. Stay lean and focused.

# The Bottom Line: Your Budget Doesn't Define Your Success

Starting and growing a business on a shoestring budget isn't just possible—it's powerful. It teaches you discipline, creativity, and resilience that money can't buy. It forces you to truly understand your customers and deliver real value. Most importantly, it ensures that when success comes, you've earned every bit of it.

Remember, some of today's most successful businesses started exactly where you are now—with more dreams than dollars. The difference between those who make it and those who don't isn't the size of their budget; it's their willingness to start where they are, use what they have, and do what they can.

Your shoestring budget isn't a limitation—it's your launching pad. The skills you develop, the relationships you build, and the creative solutions you discover while bootstrapping will serve you long after your budget grows. So embrace the challenge, enjoy the journey, and remember: every giant oak started as a tiny acorn with a dream of touching the sky.",2,1753759749.0,GrowCashflow,1,1.0,False
1mc0x4m,https://youtube.com/watch?v=-8cjtbfw-P0&si=9IxuwLWHppd7HxZB,HE SAID HE WAS “WORKING LATE” — SO I SURPRISED HIM AT THE HOTEL | cheati...,"I used to believe love was enough.  
That if you gave someone your heart, if you showed up for them — fully, wholly, without conditions — they’d never hurt you.  
I really believed that.

I met Daniel when I was 24. He was charming in that effortless, quiet way. He listened more than he spoke, made you feel like you were the only one in the room. The kind of man who pulled out chairs and remembered how you take your coffee. Vanilla oat milk, no sugar. Always.

For years, I truly thought I had everything.  
We traveled. We laughed. We built a little life filled with rituals — Sunday pancakes, movie nights on Fridays, hand-written notes slipped into lunch bags. I was the kind of woman who believed in partnership. In showing up when it’s boring. In holding hands even after the honeymoon phase.

And I thought he felt the same.

But love doesn't vanish in a thunderclap.  
It fades in whispers.  
Late meetings.  
Missed calls.  
A strange new password on his phone.

It started slowly — like a fog creeping in through the cracks.  
He’d come home tired, sighing like the world was too much. I’d rub his shoulders, pour him a drink, ask how his day was. And he’d smile… but it never reached his eyes anymore.

“I’m just slammed with work,” he’d say. “It’s nothing.”

Except it *was* something.  
It became everything.  
His phone started living face-down.  
His cologne lingered when he walked in, but not the kind I bought him.  
And sometimes, he’d come home freshly showered — claiming the office gym had better water pressure.

I wanted to believe him. God, I *tried*.  
Because the alternative felt like suffocating under my own skin.  
But the silence in our apartment grew louder.  
His eyes stopped searching for mine across the room.

And still, I clung to hope like it was oxygen.

Until that Thursday night.

He texted me around 6:45 — “Work running late. Don’t wait up.”

Just like that.

And something in me broke.  
Not because of the words.  
But because I *already knew*.

I sat on the couch for nearly fifteen minutes.  
Just... breathing.  
Not crying. Not yet.  
Just staring at the message.  
Reading it over and over like maybe it would rearrange itself into something more innocent.

But it didn’t.

So I did something I’d never done before.  
I followed my gut.

I didn’t text back.  
I didn’t call.  
I didn’t yell or scream or panic.

I got up.  
Changed into jeans.  
Tied my hair into a low bun.  
And drove.

Not fast. Not recklessly.  
Just steady. Like I already knew where I was going.

And I did.

There’s a boutique hotel just ten minutes from his office — sleek, minimal, dimly lit — the kind you’d book if you didn’t want to be recognized.  
I don’t even remember how I knew about it. Maybe something he’d said once. Maybe my intuition just screamed *there*.

I pulled into the parking garage, heart pounding so loud I could barely hear my own thoughts.  
Walked in through the side entrance.  
And at the front desk, I smiled politely and said I’d like to leave a surprise for my husband in room 412.  
Room 412.  
I hadn’t even known for sure he was there, but when the receptionist smiled back and said, “Of course, Mrs. Wells,” it was like the entire universe confirmed what I had refused to believe.

I thanked her.  
Took the key card.  
And made my way to the elevator.

Each floor ding echoed like a countdown in my chest.

When I reached the door, I didn’t hesitate.  
I tapped the card.  
Opened it.

And there they were.  
Him.  
And her.

Half-dressed.  
Frozen like deer in headlights.

His eyes met mine — wide, horrified, pleading.  
Hers darted between us like she wanted to vanish.

And I?  
I didn’t scream.  
Didn’t cry.  
Didn’t throw anything.

I just stood there.  
Quiet.  
Still.  
And smiled.

Because in that moment, everything became *crystal clear*.",1,1753759653.0,cheating_story,0,1.0,False

1mc0uqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirm/comments/1mc0uqv/biglaw_to_solo_one_year_in/,Biglaw to Solo: One Year In,"You can read my previous update, at the six-month mark, here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirm/comments/1ilm5hv/biglaw\_to\_solo\_six\_months\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawFirm/comments/1ilm5hv/biglaw_to_solo_six_months_in/)

I started my solo practice one year ago, originally focusing on litigation, but I pivoted early this year to exclusively practice estate planning.

I will avoid retreading ground covered in prior posts. This has been an exceptionally busy but less ""eventful"" period than the first six months. I have settled into some grooves and put together some effective systems that keep things consistent. I will hit a few key topics and then share some financials in the interest of transparency, because that's the kind of stuff that was helpful to me when I was considering going solo.

**Office**

With my kids coming home from school for the summer, I decided to take an office in the small town near my house. I pay $535/month for a one-room office. It's in an historic building right in the center of town, 25 minutes from a major city, centrally located in our county. The office is spacious, with my large desk, a conference table (seats 6), a coffee bar, etc without feeling cramped. As much as I enjoyed working from home, and the perks that come along with that, it just isn't efficient and I am really loving having a separate space for work. It also makes the firm feel ""real"", gives me credibility in town, and - very key - means clients come to me for signings instead of me going to their homes. That alone means the office pays for itself in saved time.

**Tech**

The big news is that I switched from Windows to Mac in April. I really liked my Microsoft Surface, but the ARM processor had compatibility issues with a number of things - most annoyingly my printers. I just could not get them to work consistently. I switched to a Macbook Air and could not be happier. 

I am still using Zoho One for much of my tech. Zoho CRM is my lead/intake CRM and case management platform. It continues to be excellent, and there is plenty of headroom for me to do more automation, more build-outs, and more customization. They are in the process of releasing AI agents with impressive capabilities. Along with CRM, I use Zoho Sign (esignature), Workdrive (cloud storage), Forms (web forms for intake), Flow (workflow automation like Zapier), and Bookings (calendar bookings). All of this for $45/month per seat is just a preposterous value. I don't use Zoho Meetings, even though I really like it; I use Zoom because everyone is familiar with it.  I don't use Zoho Books, I use Quickbooks Online because my accountant requires it. 

I have a Lexis subscription from my litigation days, which I'm trapped in. I do use it a couple of times a month, but I wouldn't keep it up if I didn't have to. 

I use Wealthcounsel for drafting, and ultimately it's good. The CLE is valuable, the drafting works pretty well, and it's nice to know the docs you're putting together are starting from a solid foundation. I'd like to see them fix some things, and I'd like to pay less (I'm on the mid-tier plan for $598/month), but overall it makes me far more money than it costs me.

I use Google Voice but would like to upgrade to something else soon. GV has delays sometimes that are irritating, and I hear other platforms are better on that.

Gmail for email, Gemini for AI, which I use a ton. I am wanting to buy a permanent license for MS Office to avoid the monthly fee (I don't use 365 online), but haven't done it. Any suggestions on that would be great.

I really love TextExpander - saves me a lot of time and frustration.

I struggled for a while with what PDF software to use, because Adobe bugs the hell out of me. I was using PDFGear, which is great, and free, but has a 50-file daily limit on conversions, which you can't buy your way around (I asked). Since a client's docs may be 15+ documents, I hit that limit sometimes. Then I discovered I could make a Shortcuts macro that converts using native print-to-pdf, but it's still searchable. Now I just highlight the docs, and click my Doc To PDF shortcut, and it bangs them out one by one in about 5 seconds each. It's perfect.

**Staff**

My mother-in-law is still my assistant. She now works over 20 hours/week for me, and takes a lot off my plate. The idea that people are doing a firm fully solo is insane to me. So inefficient, so much time wasted on low-value tasks. If I didn't have her, I would absolutely hire a VA from the Philippines again (I had one before, but she left for a full-time gig, and I couldn't give her full time hours at the time). She wants to come back to my firm, but priority 1 is getting my MIL to full-time hours so she can leave her other position.

**Marketing**

I  get a large proportion of my clients through legal insurance (ARAG), and overall it's great. Apparently it's controversial, but it's been a lifesaver for me. I get about three to five clients per week from them, and that has given me steady income and lots of ""reps"" in these early days. They pay all their claims right away without any issue or dispute. The plan doesn't cover a signing meeting or hard copies, so once we have the draft review meeting, I either just send them final PDFs and am done, or I upsell them a signing meeting for an extra $500. Eventually, once I'm getting enough clientele through private channels, I will phase out the insurance clients, but for now it's been very good.

I am doing paid Google ads, and it has been profitable, about 5X the investment so far. It's been hard to filter out probate calls (I don't do estate admin/probate), but so far it's been good.  I'm still answering my own phone, but by the end of this year I expect not to be. I'm reluctant to give it up because I have turned a number of probate inquiries into estate plan sales, and I don't know that anyone other than me or a sales-trained specialist could have done that.

**Financials**

My gross income this year has been:

January: 7,100

February: 9,900

March: 15,400

April: 12,400

May: 18,700

June: 15,100

Total: 78,700

I am at a little over a 50% profit margin, which my accountant says is phenomenal - most of her firms are at 20-30%. I honestly feel like there is room to grow on that. With more refinement of processes, better leveraging of my referral relationships, and deeper implementation of automation, I feel like we could double our income with about a 30 to 50% increase in expenses.

**Next**

I continue to refine our processes and workflow, and continue to delegate more to my assistant. I'm excited about the opportunities presented by the AI developments from Zoho. The next frontier, though, is really leaning into my referral relationships. At about $3500 per client, even pulling one more out of a few referrers per month would be a big step. I need to be better about tracking referrals given, thanking them in impactful ways, and facilitating/asking for more referrals.

The last note I'll make is a mixed blessing: I really love managing my own firm, but it constantly threatens to take over my life. I stay up late working on automations and refining our CRM, developing templates and TextExpander snippets, and putting together marketing materials. I thought about planning a guys weeking with a buddy of mine, and my first thought was all I want is a weekend to myself to work on my firm. I have a hard time pulling away, which has historically never been my problem. It's not a real problem at this point, and isn't negatively affecting my family or anything, but I need to keep that in check, and find ways to unplug more often and better. That said, I am thankful to have a job that is not only meeting our financial needs, but which I genuinely enjoy (for the most part!), and which I can see myself doing for many years to come.",12,1753759454.0,LawFirm,2,1.0,False

After that he went silent and deleted his profile without letting me know. Hence, I wrote him a letter and put it in his mailbox.

After several days he texted me, saying that he’s seeing someone (that didn’t work out in the end) but would down to meet for coffee. He rescheduled and we ended up watching movie at his place (we have been flirt texting before we met and he mentioned that the first time is just purely fuck and he didn’t get to know me). 

So we ended up watching movie and fuck. I asked for another meeting up before leaving the country and we have had a coffee date.

Before leaving I told him how I feel (that I have never want someone, but would like to try things with him), he said that he doesn’t believe love at first sight and tend to know the person before going into a relationship. 

And since that he has become less responsive and eventually telling me:

Hey! Sorry Ive been away for a few days. 

Hope you’re having a great long weekend :)

I think at this stage I’m not really looking for anything. Just trying to focus on family, work and my current friendships. I think I’m just not in a state atm to explore things further with you. You’re very sweet though and I wish you all the best xx

And I wrote him something stupid and he didn’t reply. Since that I have gone silent for about 3 months and recently texted him trying to reconnect.

“Hey Micheal, hope you’ve been well and everything’s been going smoothly. Just thought I’d check in and see how you are doing :)”

But he didn’t reply. Would there still be a chance for me with him? I really like to explore things with him. Please help! Thanks!",1,1753759198.0,gayrelationships,0,1.0,False

Things have gotten surprisingly well since I have involuntarily joined these three, even though they are more than a little weird, they are also good people!

As I was sitting in class doing my work, a dark skinned man with a mustache walked in. It took me a moment to realize he is Yaga Sensei, Gojo, Ieiri, and Geto’s teacher.

“Aoki, is it? Gojo convinced me to take you on their mission this time in exchange for actually doing his homework.”

The man paused for a second.

“Even though there will be one special grade cursed spirit, you will probably be safe with him around.” He said with added emphasis on the word probably.

“Probably?” I asked. 

“Are you a first grade sorcerer?” Yaga asked.

I nodded, feeling slightly confused.

“You should be fine then, Aoki. Even though Gojo is an idiot, he is strong.” TYaga chuckled a little.

**One day later…**

I arrived at the location early, slightly nervous. A little far in the distance, I spotted a figure in a traditional miko outfit. Upon further inspection, that seems to be Iori Utahime from Gojo’s grade.

“Did that idiot really tell me to come here and decided to arrive late…”

I could hear Iori not so silently muttering to herself.

“H-hello, did Gojo tell you to come here too?”

I said as I slowly approached her.

Iori turned around to look at me, while I can see that she is trying her best to look as friendly as possible, I can tell how frustrated she is with Gojo.

“Hello, you are Aoki, right? Satoru told me he would be bringing an underclassman with him today, didn’t expect it to be you!”

Immediately after she finished her sentence, Gojo materialized behind her.

“Everyone is here now, huh? Now, the reason I was a little late was that I had to get coffee-”

Iori cutted him off and started to aggressively smack him, knowing full well that she can’t even touch him.

Are they dating? This thought cannot be removed from my head as Iori started to set up the curtain.

**Ingredient Quality:** Arguably the most crucial factor, ingredient quality directly impacts the flavor and texture of the final product. The best mixes utilize real dairy products, natural sweeteners (such as cane sugar or honey), and avoid artificial flavors and colors. High-quality mixes frequently enough feature a higher percentage of milkfat, contributing to a richer, creamier mouthfeel. Premium mixes will also specify the source of their ingredients, emphasizing sustainability and ethical practices.

The use of high-quality dairy ingredients such as fresh milk and cream not only contributes to a richer flavor profile but also enhances the overall texture of the soft serve. mixes that prioritize natural flavors and sweeteners provide a cleaner, more authentic taste experience, avoiding the artificial aftertaste frequently enough associated with lower-quality alternatives.

**Mix Ratio and Consistency:** A well-formulated mix should be easy to use and provide consistent results. The mix ratio (powder to water or liquid mix to water) must be clearly indicated and straightforward to follow. A pre-mixed liquid option offers additional convenience by eliminating the need for measuring and mixing,further ensuring consistency with each batch.

Proper mix ratio's guarantee optimal ice crystal formation. Pre-mixed variations save time and mitigate inconsistencies from inexperienced staff,ensuring the same great taste from batch to batch.

**Flavor Variety:** While vanilla and chocolate are classic favorites, a wide variety of flavor options allows you to cater to diverse customer preferences and create unique offerings. Top soft ice cream mix brands offer a range of flavors, from fruity options like strawberry and mango to indulgent choices like salted caramel and coffee. Some brands also provide seasonal or limited-edition flavors to keep your menu fresh and exciting.

A diverse flavor selection keeps options fresh and novel. Choices like salted caramel and coffee add an indulgent spin. Limited-edition flavors allow for experimentation without long term commitment.

**stabilizers and Emulsifiers:** These ingredients are essential for achieving the desired texture and preventing ice crystal formation during freezing and storage. High-quality mixes use natural stabilizers and emulsifiers such as guar gum, locust bean gum, or soy lecithin. These ingredients help create a smooth, creamy texture and extend the shelf life of the soft ice cream.

Natural stabilizers such as guar gum improves texture. Emulsifiers like soy lecithin prevent crystal accumulation. The result is enhanced creaminess and long shelf life for the product.**Storage and Shelf Life:** The storage requirements and shelf life of the mix are important considerations, especially for businesses with varying demand. Powdered mixes typically have a longer shelf life then liquid mixes and can be stored at room temperature until opened. Liquid mixes require refrigeration and have a shorter shelf life, usually a few weeks.

Simplified menus mean less required staff or training. Reduced wait times create enhanced customer satisfaction.**Improved Profit Margins:** while premium soft ice cream mixes may have a higher upfront cost, they can actually improve your profit margins in the long run.

1mc0n94,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlAnon/comments/1mc0n94/my_sister_a_lifelong_struggle_just_admitted_to_a/,"My sister, a lifelong struggle, just admitted to a mental health institute – what now?","Thanks for a Reddit reader that suggested this group. 

I'm writing this because I'm feeling incredibly lost and heartbroken, and I'm hoping to get some perspectives or advice from those who have navigated similar situations. I've been reading posts here for a while, trying to understand addiction, and my heart goes out to everyone affected by this brutal disease. We're all suffering.
My sister, who is 55, was finally admitted to a mental health institute in France today. Honestly, it's been a long time coming – her road to rock bottom has been slow and steady. She's divorced with four adult children.
Looking back, I think she might have had undiagnosed mental health issues since she was a kid. She always had these intense mood swings and was incredibly stubborn. She was the ""perfect"" one growing up – beautiful, smart, adored by our parents and grandparents. I don't know exactly when things went off the rails, but a collection of bad decisions and traumas seemed to pile up.
She had her first child at 20 with a ""loser"" dad, and they split when the baby was six months old. Then she married a successful guy and had three more kids. Materially, she had a great life, but he was a strange, cold, uninvolved, and serially cheating husband. She developed anorexia in her 20s because of his cheating. Her husband was also abusive to her older son (his stepchild), who eventually fled the house in the middle of the night to escape. This son then chose to live with his deadbeat biological dad. That's when she started drinking at night – she was constantly worried and felt guilty about her son's whereabouts.
On top of all this, my brother-in-law insisted my father (who had MS) live in a separate apartment in their house. My sister always claimed she wasn't part of that decision. So, she had my dad living next door for over 15 years, with nurses constantly coming and going. The last year of his care was particularly traumatic, right up until he passed away in that house.
More tragedy struck when she had a miscarriage at six months and gave birth to a stillborn baby. She never truly recovered from that. At 39, she was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer, endured grueling treatment, and had a mastectomy. During this time, her husband left her and took custody of their three children.
It took us a long time to realize she had a serious drinking problem. I had never seen her touch alcohol, and it was only about seven years ago, when she was 47, that I found a bunch of empty bottles in her garage and saw her completely out of it in her kitchen. I couldn't comprehend it because she used to just drink tons of coffee, Coca-Cola, and chain-smoke. I confronted her, and she blamed stress. I assumed it was due to my dad's deteriorating health, which is why I stayed with her for three weeks. She'd always had bouts of depression and anorexia, but she managed to hold down jobs and stay active.
Things really spiraled after her divorce. It was incredibly nasty. She lost her job (she worked for her husband's company), her car, her cell phone, and had to sell her house. She ended up with the absolute bare minimum, lost custody of her kids, and moved into a tiny apartment. She stopped working, and her home became a disgusting mess.
Last summer, we clearly saw how heavily she was drinking. We tried everything – interventions, social services (as she had no money, her electricity was cut off), outpatient addiction specialists. Everyone around her knew how bad it was, and we desperately wanted her in a psych ward, but it never happened. She had a psychiatrist who prescribed her 25 pills a day, but again, it was all outpatient. We were crying for help, but we couldn't get her the inpatient care she so clearly needed.
Then, in October 2024, the worst happened. She drove under the influence, intoxicated, and killed a motorcyclist. We were all so devastated and helpless. She spent three days in jail and was released until her judgment this October.
Two months later, in January 2025, our mom was tragically killed crossing the street. I believe my sister was sober for about five months after the accident, but she relapsed a couple of months ago. Now she's drinking 24/7 and taking pills. My niece warned me about how bad she was. Just last week, I begged my sister to admit herself to a psych ward, but options for alcohol addiction in small towns in France are limited.
Finally, today, my niece called me. My sister showed up at her place, asking to be taken to urgent care, then admitted to the psychiatric ward. She was about to jump under a train but, at the last minute, decided to go to my niece instead.
I just don't see a way out for her. If they keep her for a month and release her, the stress of the upcoming court case for killing someone might just be the end of her. She doesn't seem to grasp the consequences of her actions and absolutely cannot cope.
Has anyone been through anything similar? What can we expect? Is there any hope for long-term recovery in a situation this dire, especially with the impending legal consequences? Any advice on how to support her, or ourselves, through this would be so appreciated. Thank you for reading this long, difficult story.",1,1753758832.0,AlAnon,1,1.0,False

On the third night it was the regular, some nice guy, and an odd woman who my manager (a lady with brown hair and a way too stern voice but seemed like she had good intentions) told me to never approach her table or wipe it down. And she constantly switched tables. She eventually took me to the back to say the lady brought in a pale rotting baby in a rocker, and it was in the back room till police eventually came. I was bringing more coffee to the regular girl and the new lady just stood by, walked around for a while, and I remember having the most fear in my chest ever. It totally felt like a lucid dream, and I remember grabbing a pen from the back to protect myself. The manager had the same idea because when the lady just walked to the back, which my manager didn’t stop her(??) she screamed, ran out to attack my manager, manager stabbed her in the arm, she tried to run out the front door, but the nice guy and someone on the street pinned her down, and the police came at the perfect moment. But she somehow grabbed one of the cops gun. Shot the nice guy pinning her down and then herself. I felt genuinely scared. It felt like such a lucid dream because I felt like I was forcing myself to look behind my shoulder at the creepy lady. And I remember my manager saying “Why do you keep looking behind your shoulder?

I always found myself interested sa iyaha kay ganahan ko sa iyahang personality and all. Naay one time na the girl already now me kay lagi always ko ga interact sa iyahang live then couple of times na sya ga invite sa akoa na to grab a coffee somewhere in the city ra.

Time comes, I made up my mind na to invite her mag coffee (this time ako na nag invite cause I always siya nlng ga invite). So mao to I fetch her sa iyahang place then duha rami sa car like casual lang na conversations about life and getting to know each other. In that day naay times I notice slow moments when I look at her because I cannot also deny the fact she’s really looks good sa iyahang dress. so mao to after couple of hours namo g hatod pod nako sya saiyahang place. 

Fast forward after that day I realize na I already liked her, and always ko ga find time maka talk siya and I care also for her because she got into a hospital.

But one random thoughts 2am it comes sa akong mind na I’m afraid to loose everything again if I fall in love again. But I know maybe dili right akoang thinking because the girl already know my feelings towards her and still she’s still talking to me.

* Are there tools, reports, or methods you used to gather reliable data?

I genuinely thought I took fairly good care of my teeth and had a solid routine down (brushing/tongue scraping/flossing/water floss/xylitol gum). 
However during my initial exam was found to half 9 cavities and one broken molar (failed root canal) the requires extraction and a bone graft (and soon after an implant) due to infection. The cavities I understand (and have started the process in getting filled)as I have crowding and a diet that consists of black coffee and gummy candy. 
I was placed on antibiotics and scheduled the extraction and PSP bone graft in about 2 weeks. 
This process he has said will cost over $4000-6
(cad).
But for extraction/bone graft/implant, I am curious if there are anything other options or this the last remaining solution. Also all the family/friends I’ve spoken to have recommended in getting a second opinion. Is this the sort of this that thing that really can vary in dentist opinion? My main concern mainly is the recovery (the time and the risk of something going wrong). ",2,1753758568.0,askdentists,5,1.0,False
1mc0k52,https://www.reddit.com/r/firewater/comments/1mc0k52/just_batched_my_2nd_mash_ever/,Just batched my 2nd mash ever!,"Howdy all!

I'd like to introduce myself. I'm Mike. I bought a still. And I now have an obsession that my wife needs me to take somewhere other than her ear.

I got a [13.2GAL/50L Pot Still from Vevor](https://www.vevor.com/alcohol-distiller-c_10688/vevor-moonshine-still-water-distiller-13-2gal-50l-w-thumper-keg-pump-p_010996177710?adp=gmc&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_id=22685903672&ad_group=186823960971&ad_id=758975870378&utm_term=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22685903672&gbraid=0AAAAACq8bLUpmDw0jUtDmhMYNLmZ7ZNuP&gclid=CjwKCAjwv5zEBhBwEiwAOg2YKBz0HbndMN5hVU108Mw_cPgPX-EuXMTkLK0LVk_VRqHN6r2krINC1hoCm34QAvD_BwE). Set it up and ran a wash from wild foraged [Texas Black Persimmons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diospyros_texana) (I've read accounts of sugar content getting upwards of 24% Glc/Fru in these). They fruit for about a month and will stain anything they touch, but they make for good wild sugar. Added raw sugar and nutrients to my mash for the distillers yeast to try exxxtra harrrd, but didn't let it go the distance. Processed the batch once the bubbles slowed to less than half their rate. I just had to run it.

Took the tails and made a batch of salted caramel that I blended into it. Added some chili pequins to the sugar while it caramelized in the pan, as I foraged these with the persimmons. Both are in season and I like the idea of adding ingredients from the same ecosystem. After placing my run in jars with whole fresh roasted coffee beans, I ran it all in a heat bath to infuse. The White Russians were pretty good, even if they were just tails. Ended up making a 100 proof with the hearts and heads. I wasn't trying to cut out much other than the 4shots, as this was my first run and likely not a good one.

Now I have re-batched and will be going for a quality run with the following:

3500g Black Persimmons -est 700g Sugar- (foraged)

1000g Blueberries -est 100g Sugar- (Storebought leftovers I had from making a serrano blueberry lacto-fermentation for hot sauce)

300g Chili Pequins -est 30g Sugar- (foraged)

5000g Raw sugar

17L Springwater (Taken from the headwaters of a spring fed river near where the fruits and chilis were foraged)

Yeast Nutrient (recommended dosage)

Red Star Distillers Yeast

If I assume the sugars above are accurate, then that's 5830g, divided by 17g per Liter per 1% of alcohol, then I can get 20% out of roundabout 17.15 liters (4.53 gallons). In other words, 3.43 liters of 100% jet fuel if it was able to be separated fully. I intend on proofing down to 90-100 proof for some sippers. Leaving some as pure hearts for brave idiots that come over. Next year, I'll forage enough to fill at least 1 mini barrel with 130 proof to age.

Now I'm curious if I should do a stripping run first or if I should do a single pass and proof down from there. My still was pulling off around 130+ proof in the hearts. If I do another run to ""clean things up"", do you think I would have enough liquid to put into the Vevor from a stripping run off this batch? Can I just add distilled water to it before distilling again to give me more of a window for ""dialing in"" cuts? (Edit: I mean in the sense of adding just a little in order to ensure there's enough liquid if I'm slightly short, not adding enough to water everything down a lot.)

Thanks for taking the time, everyone! This has been a game changing purchase for me.

(I have been researching plants to forage for their sugar content and these persimmons seem to be great, but my white whale right now is Mesquite pods! Those things are 51% carbohydrates when dried. They apparently taste like caramel and are nothing like the wood of the tree. After sprouting at the end of spring, the birds handle most of them pretty fast.)",3,1753758568.0,firewater,4,1.0,False

I want to take you back, back when you were breaking hearts and beds. Back to your younger years, high school...college....some jobs you had... remember all those girls you had. They just loved to be near you, feel you, get felt by you....just for you to tag em and bag em. 

Let me take you back,
All those hurtful perverted things you said to all those girls...the names you called them, tisk tisk...the cruel lies you would tell one so you could go be with another...yeah. I know what you did. You didn't even remember most of their names the next morning did you? Yeah, I know. 

Then one came along, she was different, she stopped you on a dime. You fell for her. You wanted to make a future with her...you had babies with her... promise after promise...oh it was going to be epic! 

But then, in a twist of the plot, in the depths of the never ending laundry and babies crying, she lost her mind. Sheissed how it used to be, when she wasnt a servant and slave and bound to the house...while all the whole you could come and go and you please and seen fit. Yes, I know all too well. 

You got aggravated, you raised your voice around the children at their mother...you caused discernment and started saying things to the toddlers that warped their minds. You started to make them not like their own mother because she was fed up with you and your bs. 

You went to court, due to striking your daughter. You did that. And you lost them. Man up because I'm going to take you there. She was holding the girl...she was trying to tell you something that was important to her, that she needed you to hear but it was just coming out as an attack on you. It wasnt. The mom was telling you what she needed I'm order to be a better mom and girl for you but, you wouldn't listen. You weren't having it...she hit you, with something...and you lost your self control. In front of the children, you lost yourself. 

You struck the mom and also the baby girl....don't stop reading now...I have just begun. You didn't mean to strike the child..no no no. But it happened 😞😭 and in that moment you knew what was coming. Through the stinch of lingering cigarette smoke, weed smoke and booze...the beginning of the end had begun. 

Now, you were locked away....45 days you sat,

 With your thoughts and recollection...your aliby and excuses. None of your words held merit. You had struck a female...not one but two. 

You were so ashamed and full of guilt you ran. Ran to the mountains to be alone...to be a King....a King that devoted drugs and sold them to men and women so that their home life was distributed as well because...if you couldn't have what you wanted, then no one else could either. 

You cowered from holidays ..and drenched yourself in self pity...shot the love of the devil and hot railed the past away. How did that turn out for you...hhhmmm...

Living under a bridge, that's where it got you. A biscuit and a coffee every morning from the only friend you truly have. Still to this day he wants to help you. But I digress, you had to prove to yourself that you could acquire money and materialistic things. You did that for sure but to whose expense? Your children's. They were so small...did you actually think for a second that I wouldn't show up?

They say that Karma shows up as a lady in black.....I have come 🫴🏻 to ready to you what you did to them. Do you understand? We spoke of St Michael...

Don't hurt the children. For when you do...it may not be today, nor tomorrow but it will come. Karma will come. 

I get it, you were in your 30s when you had them...well 29 to be exact...ice man....oh what a proud nickname to bare...yeah right. 

In less than two years...I broke you down like a shotgun and exposed you for the fool you truly are. You're no challenge. You're a weak addict that loves attention. You yourself are still a child. Knocking over others building blocks. I stop guys like you on a dime. I control the narrative. From day one. I am your Karma. You have been drinking the truth away...everyday now. Those pills you do...that ain't it bro, those bottles you empty match your heart. That stuff you shoot up is only going to make things worse. Just STOP 🛑✋🏻 

Yes you can...don't roll your eyes, dont  look away! You can do this! Your potential is limitless, why? Why do you constrict yourself to this medical BS and nightly indulgences???? Why? Stop running...and drop to your knees. Run to the alter my friend...hurry...there's room for you I promise you that but YOU must stop clouding your mind. I am your Karma.


You may ask yourself, how did I get here? Great song btw...give it go. You had the world in the palm of your hands!!! And you let slip away...like sand. When I told you...be like water. Stubbornness will get you lonely. 

Trust me on that at least. 

You need..no you must sit 🪑 in the pain. You have to grow....sober. Everyone you live with currently is on some kind of pill...my god man...don't you see 🙈...no one wants to be stuck with a pill popper. No one. Get past it bro!!! You did what you did...stop calcifying your eyes 👀🫩!!!!! 

Gym is good...shooting up is bad.
Driving is good...driving while drinking is bad.
Relationships are good...thinking your smarter and better is bad.
Work is good..slaving and being taken advantage of is bad.
Know your worth but do not in anyway shape not form think that you are god sent. Stop calling yourself a king ...and a boss. Until, you have the following things

• Following Christ
• Sobriety 
• A home 
• Financial stability to accommodate 
• Your wife 
• Your children and hers
• A will after your death that lasts a lifetime 

Everything in between, the vacations, the proms, the weddings of your children and your wife's ...all of that will fall into place. It's up to you now... because I have struck you, just like you struck that girl....so many girls you hurt ..so many times you got away with it... unscathed...until now. I am your Karma. I am you....retched and ghastly...I know....you sir...are very filthy. But I am here to clean you up. You must ask for forgiveness everyday....not to me dummy. To the ones you hurt the most. Your children...their mother. You are not okay but, you can be. Until then....""may the wind be at your back""....etc",1,1753758555.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,2,1.0,False

Quick backstory: I have an assistant manager at my store who is extremely rude to everyone. If you don't do what she says, she punishes you by being rude or cutting your hours. For example, someone called in sick one day because they hurt their hand, but decided to pick up a shift the next day. The manager said Don't bother comming in tomorrow.

She shows strange favoritism towards certain employees, by which I mean she flirts with them in the middle of the store, where everyone can hear. And then, a couple of months later, those same employees get promoted. While I do think one of those employees deserved to be promoted because they worked hard, it still seemed suspicious. She gets mad at employees for not working fast enough and doesn't offer to help. She had been angry with several people, but they just kept quiet because they were afraid of her. When I showed up and started calling her out, she got mad at me. For example, I trained an individual and asked her several times not to schedule me during the busiest time, but she kept putting me in during the busiest hours, made sure there weren't enough people working on the floor. It all came to a head when I was training two people during a busy shift. Coffee had spilled, and I still had one hour left to train them on how to make all the drinks - I couldn't do it during our last shift because we didn't have enough people, and they needed me most of the time.

Anyway, when coffee spilled, she asked me to clean it up. I asked her to give me a second because I was teaching the new crew something. She insisted and said Clean it now, make one of your trainees. I told her they don't know how it was a big spill, and I didn't want them dragging coffee everywhere (plus you know how some people are genuinely clueless when it comes to cleaning spills and make more of a mess) I asked her one more time to please give me a second, she said Watch your tone.

All I could think was me? Watch my tone? The person who`s been rude to so many people in the store? The person whose behavior caused others to quit or think about quitting? The person whom other managers dislike because of their attitude, and who has had several verbal arguments with people? Me?

So I reported her. She's so mean that Ive seen people crash out from the stress of her attitude. I also made sure I wasnt the only on who felt this, as at least 10 crew members feel the same way

The scent of aged paper and dusty leather filled the air, mingling with the faint aroma of coffee brewing in the corner. 

The sun filtered through the stained-glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the worn wooden floor. The store was a labyrinth of towering bookshelves, each groaning under the weight of forgotten stories and hidden treasures.  
  
Nicolette Valentine entered the bookstore, her heels clicking softly against the wooden floor. She moved with the grace of a panther, her eyes scanning the room with a predatory intensity. Her red lipstick left a faint trace on the glass of the display case as she paused to admire a vintage edition of ""Wuthering Heights."" Her voice, a sultry purr, echoed through the store as she murmured, ""Ah, a classic."" 

She turned to the counter, where Elodie Sutton was arranging a stack of books, her cheeks flushed from the heat of the shop. Elodie looked up, her eyes meeting Nicolette's, and she stammered, ""Welcome to the Vintage Bookstore. How can I help you?"" 

Nicolette's lips curved into a slow, dangerous smile. ""I'm looking for something... special,"" she said, her voice barely above a whisper. ""And I think you might be just the one to help me find it.""  
  
Nicolette's eyes never left Elodie as she spoke, her gaze lingering on the curve of Elodie's lips. ""I've heard whispers of a book that's more than just a story,"" she said, her voice a low purr. ""A book that can stir the soul, ignite the senses. I believe you know where to find it."" Elodie's cheeks flushed a deeper shade of pink, her breath catching as she tried to maintain her composure. ""I... I might have an idea,"" she stammered, her voice barely audible. 

Nicolette's smile deepened, her fingers brushing against Elodie's as she reached for a book. ""Then let's find it together,"" she murmured, her voice laced with promise.  
  
Elodie's breath hitched as Nicolette's fingers traced the line of her hand, her touch sending shivers up Elodie's arm. The dim light of the Rare Books Room seemed to intensify the heat between them, the air thick with unspoken desires. 

Nicolette's voice was a low, sultry whisper as she leaned in, her lips brushing against Elodie's ear. ""I want to explore every inch of you, Elodie,"" she murmured, her breath warm against Elodie's skin. Elodie's eyes fluttered closed, her heart pounding in her chest as she felt Nicolette's hand slip under her blouse, her fingers tracing the curve of her back. ""I want to feel your skin against mine,"" Nicolette continued, her voice filled with promise. 

Elodie's breath came in short gasps as she felt Nicolette's hand move lower, her fingers hooking into the waistband of her skirt. ""I want to taste you,"" Nicolette whispered, her voice laced with desire. Elodie's eyes snapped open, her gaze locking onto Nicolette's. 

She reached up, her fingers tangling in Nicolette's hair, pulling her closer. ""Then do it,"" she breathed, her voice barely audible.

The only notable incident was in the District 10 apartment. Carrie attempted to switch out the half-n-half milk for hot sauce in Spencer’s coffee but put it in Toby’s mug by mistake. Toby punished her by splashing the drink into her face. Carrie screamed as she rushed into the bathroom with bloodshot eyes and Spencer’s hysterical laughing echoing in her ear
When all twenty six tributes arrived, their training master Norman Daniels greeted his first batch of tributes. Norman was a general spy from the Capitol that helped slowly take over the main spots of Unidad, Berlin, France, and Rome. Norman read the rules and particularly eyed the 12s and 15s saying that guards will be everywhere. And after one more run down on the rules he dismissed the tributes to their stations.
Cole (1) and Icarus made their way to the weight stations along with the District 1 and 2 girls then made their way to the archery station. Darcy (1) laughed seeing Elizabeth (9) in the camouflage station to the left of the archery station which was the camouflage station. Philly (6) started screaming drunkenly at Elizabeth for accidentally tipping a pile of green paint on him which ruined the sea background. As they started arguing, Harmonia got clever and shot an arrow by their faces, nearly killing them. Daniels marched over to scold Harmonia while other trainers went to stop the fighting. Philly and Elizabeth ran off to different stations in fear. Harmonia looked up at the mentoring gallery seeing Claudia feigning a disapproving shake of the head while holding in laughter. 
Later on, Harmonia was mildly annoyed when Darcy began nitpicking the way she was shooting an arrow. The girl held her own but got her petty revenge when they met back up with Cole and Icarus. She stepped on Darcy’s foot with her sharp heeled foot. They then spent some time in the weight station with Cole in particular getting more annoyed with Icarus’s almost “animalstic” grunts. Astoria stated on her live commentary alongside Josephus that the careers not getting along this much could be early graves for all of them. 
Cole was beginning to feel aggravated at the nearby Jack (7), who was mocking him saying that Cole had a “small axe”, but Icarus told him to stop complaining or leave the alliance. As Darcy and Cole went to the sword station, Icarus went back to being an animal at the weight station. However Harmonia stayed with them with Darcy smiling saying, “Since you're not as crazy as he is you can stay.” Harmonia laughed before joking, “I was planning on staying anyways.” For the remainder of the allocated training day the pair stayed in the sword station with Harmonia  still showing her usual District 2 charm in frightening other tributes. In one instance, Training Master Daniels reprimanded her for making Board (3) cry. But the girl smiled saying ""Didn't you say you would give him at least a day?” The audience in Stone Square laughed hysterically with Jospehus saying, “Maybe three graves instead of four.”
With the 10s, Spencer and Carrie did not stay by each other. Carrie tried to sabotage Spencer’s efforts to learn camouflage, but he simply ignored her and continued practicing. up at the camouflage station. After seeing Harmonia scare Philly (6) and Elizabeth (9), Georgina (4) noticed the pair and watched them for a few minutes before waving her hand over. Carrie got up to greet her but Georgina told her, “Not you, him.” Carrie rolled her eyes and wanted to protest but Tyler (4) shoved her out of the way. When Spencer arrived, Tyler smiled and said “Ye need a break from the crazy bitch.” Spencer grinned and nodded. He asked why the sudden interest and Georgina explained that he seemed like a good candidate to help fight the careers. “Besides, anyone with the patience to ignore that crazy siren is cool in my book.” While Carrie spent the remainder of her training day in the obstacle course, Tyler told Spencer he can stay with them past the first day if he could practice using a trident to a decent level. The boy nodded before nearly fumbling using the trident but learned. After a while, Georgina and Tyler approved and allowed him to join. Spencer hung out with the 4s in the aquatic station for the remainder of the day. Spencer was enthralled by both his new allies’ stories about shipbuilding and Georgina was amused by Spencer's stories about his family restaurant and Carrie’s one-sided fighting with Spencer.
At the end of training, Training Master Daniels brought the twenty six tributes to their training assessment room. The actual training assessment center was still in its final touches of remodeling, so the assessments were held in an isolated corner of the room. Under the request of the new head game maker, this year's scores were kept secret to a degree but Capitol gossip mongers managed to find some scores. Icarus and Harmonia (2) got the top scores of 11 each which wasn't any surprise while the 1s and Georgina (4) followed with 10s each. Spencer managed a respectable 7 which was later shown that he “was more than appearances could reveal”.  Carrie scored the second to lowest score, a 4, while the lowest score being Kimmy	(3) and David (12) scoring a 2 each.
The interviews were the most hotly anticipated event in this year's games. The first ever of the fourth incarnation, Astoria started off as the lead woman in the interviews. She waved to the excited audience in a glorious red dress with golden jewels littered all over. She asked the audience who they think were the ""Potential victor”. Many voices shouted out their picks, with Icarus(2), Harmonia(2), and even Spencer (10) being heard the most. Astoria excitedly readied herself before calling for Darcy. After the 1s  fruitful interviews Harmonia was called to the stage. The audience excitedly cheered seeing her twirl her way onto the stage. She wore a long ruby gown with golden crystals placed from head to toe of the dress. Her face even had a golden face paint pattern that made her look like a golden phoenix and her long brown hair was put up in a nice bun with more golden crystals put in the bun.

Astoria and Harmonia hugged and had a “good ol 'catch up” like they were old friends.   Astoria kicked off the interview with questions regarding her alliances and how she planned on winning the games. Harmonia grinned saying, “Like how any District 2 victor wins: strategic thinking, taking no prisoner and making a name for yourself uniquely.” The audience got excited and shouted random questions. Harmonia then stated “I don't know if this is going to   help but I’m planning on starting a rock band Mockingbird Rock.” The audience immediately shouted in cheer with Astoria smiling saying “wanna give them a solo”. She was handed a guitar and she began a solo she called Your Not My Dad. The audience went ape shit in cheers and grins all around.  As the song concluded, Astoria asked her if she had her eye on anyone. Harmonia smiled and said, “Are you trying to ask me if I want to get into the pants of the man who nearly S’ad me? You're full of shit”. As the audience “Oooed” dramatically, she flipped off Astoria before waving to the audience who was cheering at the “girl boss” energy of Harmonia before she left the stage.
Icarus was then called to the stage as his massive fan base “roared” to welcome  him as he “roared” with excitement only wearing a golden tank top with rather bland gold suited pants with a “smell” of charcoal following him which made audience begin to get nauseated, Icarus seemed to “Charm the socks off of”  Astoria already. She mumbled to him about the way he would kill the other tributes with Icarus mumbling back in feigning romance that he would “squash the others heads”. He looked at the audience who were throwing roses and chocolates at him and the boy started sneezing. Astoria rolled her eyes saying, “Geez get a medic.”
The audience felt bad as Icarus’s allergic reaction was stopped and the boy sat in a sour mood backstage but was interviewed by a backstage tabloid. The other interviews were interesting to say the least. Kimmy (3) got kicked off the stage when she told capitalites to “eat shit”. Philly (6) puked half way during his interview and Patch (8) was shooed off stage after he caused a stir about “seeing double”. 
After Cornel(9)’s interview, Carrie was welcomed to the stage. Peacekeepers had to drag the girl onto the stage as she apparently was quite loony with peacekeepers later reporting that she mistakenly had a repeat of the “hot sauce incident” but sabotaged Philly (6)’s water with hot sauce. Luckily as Philly did not drink it, she dumped it on Carrie and gave her a ""courtesy gift” which in fact was morphine. Carrie drunkenly made a fool of herself which disgusted the audience greatly. Astoria tried to ask her about her home life but she attempted to “flash” the audience but thankfully was dismissed from the stage.
Spencer was welcomed next as the audience cheered happily. The boy mumbled in fear but pushed past it cordially and waved to the audience sporting an orange suit, black dress pants, and his hair being nicely combed back with a parting in the middle. Astoria immediately asked him for the juicy gossip mainly referring to Carrie. Spencer smiled before calling her a “jealous whore”. The audience laughed hysterically with Astoria jokingly slapping her knee saying, “Tell me more DARLING!”. Spencer smiled and entertained the audience with tales of Carrie’s legal problems. Astoria switched the conversation to his family restaurant back home. Spencer said he wanted to win more than anything to return to “La Plaqua neighborhood” and remove Carrie’s dad from his position of sector magistrate. Astoria asked what that was and Spencer described them as “glorified tattletales” assigned to each sector and always reported back to the mayor daddy dearest. Spencer brought the conversation back by voicing his wish to open up his own restaurant in the Capitol. As the audience cheered excitedly for the boy,   Astoria asked him if he thought he actually had a chance to win. Spencer rolled his eyes saying, “I think my odds are better than the 12s.” As the audience laughed, Astoria thanked Spencer for his time before the boy left with cheering crowds wishing him luck. After the painful District 12 interviews and interesting District 15 newbie interviews with Beth (15) amassing a small fan base, Astoria called for the new Head Gamemaker Valentina Gaul to the stage.

1mc0gbl,https://i.redd.it/1amvkdhjbqff1.jpeg,"Salted Caramel Coffee- See's Candies reminiscent, salvaging a scorched sweet cream base","I was trying out a few different base recipes to zero in on a favorite. Ample hills was the next in line. While heating the milk with sugar and powdered milk added, I looked away for too long and it scorched on the bottom. It wasn't ruined, but there was a very distinct toasted milk flavor. 

I decided to try a salted caramel flavor to salvage the ingredients. I scooped one third cup of granulated sugar into a clean sauce pan and melted/burned it as for flan. Then I poured the molten caramel into my measuring cup of cream to dissolve (I never like to heat all of the liquid in a recipe for tempering eggs if it will just be cooled afterward- half usually suffices- so the cream was sitting ready to add at the end.) 

I whisked the boiled milk into the eggs, stirred and added the caramel cream, and add about 1 teaspoon of salt until it tasted right. Then I added a teaspoon of instant coffee granules because the mix had a coffee-like flavor. 

It churned beautifully, and the caramel/coffee/salt flavor is perfect. It reminds me of those See's Candies lollipops, which seem to have coffee in the caramel flavor and caramel in the coffee. I grew up eating See's chocolates on special occasions, and still believe that no one else does those dark complex caramelized flavors quite as well. This ice cream wad intended to make a mistake pleasant and edible- instead it's smashed all of my other ice creams out of the park. Now to see if it's possible to recreate without scorching the milk.

I see a lot of recipes that are VERY particular about stirring.  Directions can be like:  ""You must only stir 5 times in an east/west direction and 5 times in a north/south direction.""  ""Stir only 10 times back and forth, then lift your stirring device to the middle of the liquid and do the same, then slowly raise your stirring device while gently going back and forth until you have reached the top"".

The supposed reason for these directions is to have a flat surface of the grounds to press against to ""avoid channeling"".  But my favorite recipe says to ""stir well for 30 seconds""--none of this delicate, careful stirring that many recipes advise.  When I look at my pucks, they are solid, even on all surfaces, no evidence of channeling.  

An espresso machine applies pressure with steam.  I can see why you would want a nice even coffee bed, so that the steam applies pressure evenly against the grounds.  I understand the need for a distribution tool and tamping in an espresso machine.  But the Aeorpress applies an even pressure with a flat device--much like tamping. The plunger does the job of the tamping tool.  I've never seen evidence of channeling in my pucks.  I love the flavor my favorite recipe produces.  

Am I just dumb and unsophisticated about this?  

I'd be interested to hear from people who take their favorite recipe and apply a different stirring technique to see if it makes any difference to the flavor of their coffee or the composition of the puck.  And from people who argue that very careful stirring is an absolute must.  What don't I understand???",2,1753758101.0,AeroPress,4,0.75,False

Please comment below your thoughts, and what you think my plan of action should be. I am beyond terrified and scared that I might have found something that will put my life in danger...

[Link to Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c0r8ld/part_1_i_think_i_found_a_mass_grave_in_my_omas/)

The following day, I jumped out of bed with a fresh-found vigor. I was bursting with excitement and hurried downstairs to eat and get out the door. After breakfast with my family, I told my parents I planned to explore the forest. They asked me to take my younger brother, but I knew I couldn't drag him along for this, so I politely refused. With some huffing and puffing from my parents, I got my things together and headed into the forest. I had two water bottles, a flashlight, my phone, wallet, pocket knife, and headphones at the bottom of my backpack.

The air was cool and refreshing; a light breeze swayed the branches above my head. It was sunny, but the heat was minimal. I loved the weather in Germany; it was far better than the Texas heat I endured every summer. The forest around me had grown highly dense, and I had started to walk at a slight incline. Before long, I noticed the ground taking a drastic upward angle. The thick coat of leaves covering the forest bed made it difficult to stand, so I lowered myself to the ground and began to crawl. The ground was incredibly slick, and I felt like any second now, I would fall. A tree just out of reach looked like it could support my weight, so bracing myself I lunged for it. Without fail, I clasped onto the base and held myself before pulling my legs up. As my feet found a comfortable position, a loud **CRACK** broke the forest's silence, and before I could react I was tumbling backward.

Covering my face and head, I rolled down the hill, rocks and branches assaulting me from every angle. The speed at which I was falling increased, and I knew I needed to try and slow my fall. With a last-ditch effort for safety, I opened my eyes, moving them side to side hoping to catch a glimpse of my surroundings. As I swung my head back to face center, I saw a strange-looking pile of leaves directly in my path. I immediately thought it resembled a small outcropping, but I hit it before I could determine exactly what it was.

The impact sent a violent shudder up my spine, and my legs buckled under the force. I collapsed in a pile of limbs and appendages, groaning from the pain this fall had caused. However as I lay there, coming to my senses, I realized two things. One I had stopped falling, and two the outcropping I lay on was firm. I was hurting, that's for sure, but as far as I could tell my body was intact aside from a few obvious cuts and bruises. Brushing away the leaves at my feet, I saw a manhole cover standing out from the concrete that surrounded it. Leaning in, I examined the cover and chuckled when I saw what was in its middle. A swastika stared back at me, almost as if it were the **X** that marked the spot. *Did I just find an entrance to the bunkers? Not possible*.

Standing up, which took considerable effort, I leaned over the edge and saw a wall of concrete disappearing into the slope below. The structure I found myself on almost resembled a chimney, tall and rectangular. *How has this never been found? I didn't see it on my way up. Was it here this whole time?* I couldn't understand how something this large was suddenly presented to me, but I wasn't going to complain. All that mattered was that I had found it, and now I had a serious decision to make. *Do I go now, or do I wait till night?* I took a second to think and then decided that I'd have to go at night. My parents were inherently cautious, and I knew they would worry if I disappeared during the day. At night, fast asleep, they couldn't worry about much more than the dreams in their heads. I videoed the area around the entrance and took detailed pictures so as not to forget where this structure stood.

When I arrived home, my Oma immediately scolded me because I had gotten so dirty. I apologized and mentioned that I had slipped while exploring. She laughed it off and told me to put my clothes in the wash. The afternoon passed by quickly, and the night was fast approaching. My nerves were wired, and I was growing antsy. I had checked my bag three times to ensure I had everything, and now I just had to wait till the house fell silent. As I waited, I let my mind wander to what I might find below the surface, but I couldn't imagine my adventure turning into something like the movie *The Descent*. When I heard the first faint snores coming from my grandmother's and my parent's bedrooms, I crept out the back door and was off into the mountains.

Darkness consumed everything around me, and I was beginning to feel uneasy. Night in the forest was no joke; mixed with the all-consuming darkness, the sounds of animals and creatures led to paranoia. I had mapped out the location of the entrance earlier, but the pictures and videos I had taken were from the middle of the day, and the addition of night rendered them useless. It was like the forest from earlier had been picked up and dropped into a different dimension. My surroundings were far from familiar and I was afraid I'd be lost if I didn't find the Concrete Chimney (the name I gave the structure) again soon.

The ground had started to reach an incline again, and for the first time since walking out the backdoor, I felt like the entrance to the bunker was close. My flashing suddenly reflected off the slab of concrete rising out of the dirt and leaves around it. I had made my way back to the Concrete Chimney, and now more than ever felt the pressure of what I would find deep inside the mountain I stood upon. Pulling myself onto the the top of the entrance, I squatted down next to the manhole cover displaying the Swastika symbol and opened my backpack reaching inside for the crowbar I'd stolen from my Oma's outside shed. I'll admit, I hadn't used a crowbar before to pry off a manhole cover, but time spent on YouTube and internet forums in the late afternoon had given me enough confidence to give it a go.

Wedging the edge of the crowbar underneath the lid, I applied my full strength to the opposite end of the bar and pushed. The lid flew off with ease, landing with a resounding *THUD* in the bed of leaves left of the Chimney. Turning back to face the now open hole, I let my flashlight illuminate a ladder that disappeared into the darkness my light couldn't penetrate. Checking once more the contents of my backpack, I zipped it shut, and slung it over my back. Lowering myself onto the first wrung, I took a deep breath and began my descent.

Dust billowed up in clouds around me as I made my way down the metal ladder wrung by wrung. The urge to sneeze was all-consuming, but I forced myself to ignore it, afraid the involuntary movement that comes with sneezing would send me tumbling into the dark abyss beneath me. 15 minutes or so of fighting sneezes, and breathing in stale air had passed, as I planted my feet on the dirt floor the ladder ascended from. Looking up, the light from the opening looked like a pinhole, barely visible to my eyes. Judging by the distance, I was at least two hundred feet down, but with no tape measure to corroborate my estimate, my guess was as good as yours.

The room I was standing in was vast and looked to have been frequented by teenagers looking for a place to party and let loose. Graffiti decorated the stone walls, and empty cans of beer and seltzers were littered across the floor. *I'm not the first to go down here, but how far did those before me get?* I thought as I slowly surveyed the room. Across from where the ladder met the floor, was an opening in the wall forming the entrance to a dark tunnel. Unease spread through me as I gazed into the tunnel's darkness, but having come this far my only option was to continue onward.

Before committing to the tunnel, I wanted to examine the Graffiti that surrounded me. Most of the images and words were nonsensical, just your typical drunken vulgar phrases, and crude jokes. The expressions on the wall were nothing more than remnants of an alcohol-soaked night, and with nothing left to see, I tightened the straps on my pack and marched headfirst toward the tunnel that patiently awaited my arrival.

My flashlight lit up the entrance to the tunnel, exposing dust, cobwebs, and beer cans, but there were fewer visible in the tunnel, compared to the piles that surrounded me. The tunnel's roof looked to stretch far into the darkness, and the walls looked wide enough to fit three people walking side by side. I stepped into the tunnel and began to walk, keeping my light focused on the stretch in front of me. I expected to feel panic or fear as I walked deeper and deeper into the tunnel, but in reality, I felt very comfortable being surrounded by miles of stone on every side. After a while, I observed a downward slant in the tunnel, indicating a descent into the inner reaches of the mountain.

After 15 minutes of walking, I paused to catch my breath and jot down some of the thoughts circulating through my head. Sitting against the cool stone wall, I pulled a brown leather notebook out of my bag and flipped to the first empty page that was available. The thoughts and observations I had thus far, flowed seamlessly from the tip of my pen onto the blank canvas of the page.

*I've been walking for 45 minutes or so, and I've got to be around five or six hundred feet under the ground.*

*The first stretch of the tunnel showed signs of exploration, but I don't think anyone has been this deep down in years. This place looks untouched.*

*This far down it has gotten awfully cold, and the silence I've been walking in has gone from peaceful to eerie. I feel strange, something seems wrong.*

*I can't imagine this tunnel going much farther, but then again, it could be miles before I reach an end. Either way, I'm committed to finding out.*

Closing my notebook, a genuine sense of unease grew as I thought about what might lie ahead. I had no idea what I might come across, but the feeling I had as I turned to head deeper didn't boost my confidence. I started to slow my pace as the tunnel began to curve, the floor's slope becoming steeper as I continued. With each impending turn, I found myself pausing, my imagination conjuring images of elusive creatures lurking in the shadows, eager to bring this exploration of mine to a close.

Rounding another bend, I saw that the tunnel stretched on again, forming a long straight line. The ground had also leveled out, and I began to feel like this was where I would be facing the horrors of the mountain. I let the beam of my flashlight traverse the expanse ahead, halting abruptly upon encountering a substantial metal door, firmly fixed to a wall at the passage. Approaching with caution, I noticed a message etched into the stone above the metal door's frame. The message, crudely constructed read:

*Gib Alle Hoffnung auf, der du hier eintrittst* (*Abandon all hope, you who enter here.*)

A sharp breath entered my lungs as I stepped back, shocked by what I had just read. I knew the quote all too well, having read Dante's *Divine Comedy*. I didn't want to go any further, and opening the door to see what awaited me seemed futile. But as I stood before the door, I felt that I owed it to myself, my family, and the people of Schwarzdorf. Reciting a prayer, I lowered my hand to the weathered, oversized metal bolt and maneuvered it to disengage the locking mechanism securing the door to the stone wall. The door swung open with a tremendous *THOOM* as it made impact with the wall.

A cold, strong gust of wind flew from the open doorway, goosebumps forming on my forearms as I stepped over its threshold. The fear of the unknown coursed through my body as I continued down a long narrow passage. The tunnel felt claustrophobic and the lack of light played tricks on my eyes. The sight of the same stone walls, the same dirt floor, and the same dark emptiness caused me to feel as if I were walking in place. There was a completely different feeling to this passage, something bad had happened here.

The repetitive nature of the tunnel was broken when my light illuminated what looked like personal belongings, strewn all over the floor in front of me. Approaching the first items, I noticed their age almost immediately. They looked outdated and from another time. A multitude of personal articles, including watches, hats, shoes, socks, shirts, pants, earrings, necklaces, and various other possessions, were strewn across the ground. Try and imagine someone taking their entire wardrobe and dumping it violently on the floor. This is the scene that presented itself to me.

I experienced a sense of discomfort upon observing the cluttered floor, yet I couldn't fully understand the underlying significance of it. Something wasn't right deep within this mountain, but I knew it fell upon me to uncover its secrets, regardless of the fear I felt. I continued forward, the narrow passage starting to twist and turn like the banks of a river. There were belongings everywhere now, piles of people's lively hood sheepishly stacked against the tunnel's cold stone walls.

Then without warning, I was hit by the smell. An odor so foul that even death would recoil, entered my nostrils, causing me to stumble backward as vomit crept into my throat. Kneeling, I dry-heaved violently, immobilized by the putrid stench. *What the hell is this? Where is this shit coming from?*

I battled the urge to turn and run, fear taking hold of my body. *I can't keep going. Something is seriously wrong here,* I thought still fighting the waves of nausea. *I've come this far though, I know it'll haunt me if I turn back now, I've got to find answers...* I had made my decision, a decision I would come to regret, but with a false sense of resolve, I got to my feet and dropped my pack off my back. I dug through its contents, searching for my minuscule first aid kid. It was sitting at the bottom of my bag, ready to be opened and used. I searched through the Band-Aids, pain meds, and creams till I came across a thick gauze pad. Tearing off two pieces, I wound them up and stuffed them firmly in my nose. The stench was instantly dampened, and I felt the nausea finally starting to subside.

Gathering the strength to move, I stepped forward and once more resumed my slow walk towards the source of the small. Quicker than I had hoped, my crudely constructed nose plugs started to lose their effect, rendering me exposed to the smell again. It was stronger now, signaling my fast-approaching arrival to the source. I found another door up ahead, fixed into the wall like the last, but the sight of this door immediately tripped the not-so-silent alarms in my head.

There were large dried crimson splashes of blood staining the door's steel surface, and beneath it were dried pools on the floor as well. I had the primal urge to run until I was far away from this place, but the curiosity inside me drove me forward. Reaching for the handle I slowly pulled the door open, releasing the strongest wave of death yet. I struggled to remain composed, an onslaught of the stench surrounding me. Bracing for a waking nightmare, my light shone into the room beyond the door, and when I realized its size, it took my breath away.

The expanse resembled an ancient hall, its length, and height unknown to me. Walking forward through the doorway, I moved my light along the room's long walls, my eyes picking up on an abundance of identical metal doors, evenly spaced along the portions of the wall lit up by my light. As I continued forward and more walls were exposed, I saw more doors following the same mirrored fashion. It was unnerving and slightly uncanny, resembling a lost level of the backrooms.

The center of the room quickly approached and as I swung my light back to face the space in front of me, I saw a large circular pit awaiting me. I was standing near the edge and felt the wobbly sensation you experience when standing over a vast expanse. Training my light on the dark hole, I let out an audible *GASP* when I exposed its contents hidden by the dark.

There were thousands of bodies piled on top of one another. Men, Women, and Children were stuffed into the hole like sardines in a can, their disfigured corpses glaring back at where I stood. Snapping out of shock, I stumbled backward, slipping on the floor beneath me. As I came crashing down on my back I felt a strange texture beneath me, resting atop the floor like some laminate. My light had gone off when I fell to the ground, and I had to resort to crawling around in an all-consuming dark, inches from a vast expanse filled with corpses. My hand brushed against the metal handle of the flashlight, and I quickly grabbed it, flipping the switch to illuminate the floor.

My light shone off the dried blood that engulfed the entirety of the floor. It was everywhere, turning the floor from a pearly white to a dark gruesome shade of red. I let out a terrified scream, throwing myself to my feet while I frantically brushed away at the areas of my clothing exposed to the floor. I was bewildered, disgusted, panicked, and afraid. I was feeling a thousand emotions and couldn't decide which to address first. I found myself standing in the blood of thousands; men, women, and children murdered and butchered relentlessly in this room. The pieces of the puzzle I had been so eager to solve fell into place seamlessly as I began to comprehend the abomination I had discovered.

That base my Oma had mentioned, was no base but an underground secret factory of death. The disappearance of Schwazdorf's Jewish Community, the great mystery, had been solved. I had found their final resting place, and within these walls, the depravity of human nature had been on full display. The men of Schwarzdorf, my great-grandfather, had been forced to kill his neighbors at the command of the Nazi Party. I wished in this moment I hadn't pursued my curiosity. I wished these bunkers and this chamber never existed. I hoped for many things, but none that I could control. I had brought myself here, ignored the warning signs, and would now face the consequences.

Peering over the edge once more, I let myself fully witness the crime committed here so many years ago. The brief glimpse I had of death moments earlier, its brutality, was no comparison to the prolonged gaze I maintained now. The bodies within the pit were deeply disfigured, decomposition had set in, but yet somehow their broken figures were not skeletal. I could see signs of burns, cuts, abrasions, beating, gunshot wounds, and many other forms of torture and abuse. I couldn't bear to look at their gaunt sunken expressions, so I turned my back to the pit and let out the tears I'd attempted to keep from flowing out of my eyes.

I felt broken, my mind shattered, and this reality felt like a waking nightmare. I started to head towards the exit, my pace slow and solemn. Before exiting I came to a stop in front of the doorway, a single thought triggering a sudden internal conflict. *I never looked behind the doors in the walls*. Part of me wanted out, practically begging for fresh air, while the other part of me was overcome with curiosity, and wanted to continue. I realized this would likely be my final descent into this chamber, and the world I planned to share this with would need the whole story.

Veering to my right I headed straight to the first visible door in the wall. There were small glass panes embedded in the door from which I could peer into the room, but with no source of light, seeing anything through them was impossible. I tried the first handle but to my surprise, it was locked. I moved to the next door and tried the handle. Same outcome as the last time. The third door I came to was cracked open, allowing me to enter the dark chamber. My flashlight hit the darkness and parted it, exposing a large industrial oven. The floor beneath it had piles of belongings, like the tunnel outside this chamber, and it took me no more than a second to understand what went down there.

Stepping back through the doorway, I slammed the door shut and moved to open the next door. This door was unlocked and when I opened it, my light showed me a room full of tools and surgical devices. Lined up against the back wall were six metal tables. Dried blood decorated their surfaces, indicating the atrocities performed in this room. I was beginning to have enough, my head was throbbing, and my eyes were dry from crying. I needed to leave soon, it felt like I was starting to lose my mind. The end of the wall loomed ahead, and with each open door, I peered through the same gruesome picture of murder and despair that was put on display. Turning to face the chamber's back wall, I moved my light slowly across its surface, a message coming into focus, having been concealed by the darkness. In the center of the wall was a message written in large almost comical letters. It read *DIE TOTEN* (THE DEAD) and covering the wall beneath it were thousands of small almost unrecognizable tally marks.

Another wave of nausea washed over me when I realized the number of people killed in this room tallied into the tens of thousands. This operation here had taken place on an unimaginable scale, and as I stood in the center trying to comprehend its significance my mind broke. I screamed violently, my whole body shaking uncontrollably. I was standing around the remains of thousands of men, women, and children who had their lives brutally ended here because of some psychopath's wicked agenda. The perpetrators, those responsible for these horrific atrocities, had escaped and managed to hide their crimes deep within this mountain. I was furious, overwhelmed, depressed, and stressed, and my emotions were splintering and shattering causing me to spiral at an even faster pace. My heart was pounding in my throat, and with hesitation, I was bolting for the exit. Stumbling through the doorway, I ran through the piles of personal belongings left to rot, my tears blurring the light that guided my escape.

I don't recall much from this point forward, other than the descent up the cold metal ladder. The frantic nature of my escape had rendered me helpless, and the exhaustive amount of external stimulation had caused my short-term memory to fade. How I managed to retrace my steps and make it to the ladder, is still unbeknownst to me, but I thank God I could find my way back. When I arrived at the lip of the manhole, it was still dark out, but the sounds of nature waking had started. I pulled myself onto the surface of the concrete structure, and inhaled deeply, allowing the fresh air to calm my disturbed demeanor.

It felt like I had just crawled out of the depths of hell, and based on what I found, I might as well call the depths of this mountain hell. Crouching back down, I lowered myself onto the bed of leaves and heaved the metal lid back onto the concrete chimney. With the lid firmly back in place, I took one last look at the Swazstika which to me was just a relic of history but now meant something far more sinister. The rage I felt toward the people responsible was uncontrollable. I wanted to expose their secrets to the world, I wanted everyone to know of the evils that took place here, and I wanted to give those who were forced to participate the platform to tell their stories. The men of this town became victims alongside the Jewish Community. They all had their lives as they knew it ended in this mountain. Whether they made it out to see the daylight or remained in the dark for eternity, they all died down there as the collateral of a wicked dictator. *I'll have to get rid of these clothes, there is no good explanation for how I look right now*. Pulling off my boots, I opened the back door and stepped onto the green carpet of the second floor. I b-lined it for the bathroom, and practically dove into the shower, my body language changing drastically as the warm water flowed over me. I had seen unexplainable atrocities, witnessed the calculated extermination of a community, and finally understood why the Nazis were always painted as so ruthless and evil. I had seen unexplainable atrocities, witnessed the calculated extermination of a community, and finally understood why the Nazis were always painted as so ruthless and evil.

I had only laid in bed for 30 minutes before I heard my Oma getting out of bed, signaling the start of the day. With sleep eluding me, and the confines of the room feeling inconsequential, I decided to rise from bed, dress, and descend the stairs. My Oma was preparing early morning coffee, and as I entered the kitchen and saw her smiling to herself while humming a foreign tune, I realized I couldn’t speak to her about what I found. The horror of it, and the implications it had on the reason her father killed himself would crush her. Hiding the pain I felt, I told her good morning and grabbed a cup to take with me to the living room. The couch was unbelievably comfortable and allowed me to sink into its arms. I closed my eyes and immediately saw the bodies, their disfigured faces staring into my soul. With each passing moment, they got closer and closer, reaching out to where I stood at the edge of the pit. I suddenly snapped back into consciousness, my breathing labored, a cold sweat sprouting on my neck.

I needed to tell someone about this, there had to be some way I could get this turmoil building in me out. Grabbing my bag from upstairs, I walked onto the patio and plopped down in one of the chairs. The sun cast rays of warmth on my face as I opened my computer and prepared a fresh document. Within seconds I had begun to write, my fingers flying effortlessly over the keys. I came to a stopping point and headed back inside for lunch. My whole family greeted me as I walked into the dining room, their calm joyous demeanor offputting when compared to the storm brewing inside me. I asked everyone how they slept, knowing full well I hadn’t slept a minute the night before. Their responses informed me they had no idea I had snuck out, and I intended for it to stay that way.

I didn’t have anything else noteworthy happen to me for the remainder of the trip, but to say it was far from peaceful was an understatement. I had recurring nightmares of blood, corpses, and heinous acts. Throughout the last week, my outlook on life had become bleak, and I felt myself falling into deep despair. My curiosity on this trip had gotten the better of me, and now I had to deal with the consequences. I wished I would have stopped at the door. The smell alone should have been an obvious sign, but I didn’t listen. My father always told me that I didn’t know best, no matter how much I thought I did, and forever I wish I would have listened.

I arrived back home two weeks before the rest of my family, the nightmares and constant feelings of sadness ever-present. I spent a great deal of time writing and contemplating what I had found. The implications were overwhelming, and believe it or not the thing I feared most was telling the world. I could almost imagine myself finally building the courage to go public, only to be confronted by men standing at my window in black suits. There was a reason the the Devil’s Chamber had been hidden for so long, and in this case, it was probably better to let stay that way.

Against my better judgment though, I decided to finish the account I had started the morning after my discoveries. It took me a couple of weeks to write the first part, and after careful consideration, I chose Reddit as the platform for my expose. Some would think posting to Reddit was a mistake, but in my mind, the outrageous claim I was going to make, could easily be considered another act of fiction, saving my ass in the process. The first part was well received and the comments of deep concern and caution were more than comforting. I realized that though this discovery sounds like something out of a post from a fictional scary story forum, I had found people who would believe me and could help me process this information. If I were to unleash something dangerous or bring about a history-changing event, at least I would have the support of the public. Reddit was the platform that made me feel safe and allowed me to finally open up about the trauma I’ve endured since my discovery.

If you are reading this, I ask you to comment your thoughts on what I found. I am still trying to make sense of it, and hope that one of you out there can help me to figure out my next steps. Am I in danger? Did I cross a line? I need to know ASAP because if this story makes it to the wrong hands I could be facing life-threatening adversaries. The whole reason I chose to post on Reddit is because of the community, and now I ask you for that help, I need guidance and I can’t seek anyone professionally. I’ve uncovered a dark secret, hidden to time, and now I, as well as you, must tread lightly.",1,1753758085.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

You are pregnant. The baby is healthy and you are four weeks along.”

Seeing the image of her baby on the ultrasound monitor and hearing the congratulations coming out of the doctor’s mouth made Jessica feel both happy and worried.

“This is the ultrasound picture. You can show this to your husband because he didn’t come here with you. I hope for the next checkup, you can come together,” the doctor said as she handed Jessica a sheet of ultrasound report.

“Thank you,” Jessica replied as she took the report from the doctor’s hand. She stared at the photo for a moment as she caressed the picture of the baby that would be born from her womb nine months later.

‘I can’t wait to see you,’ she murmured as she caressed her still-slim belly. Jessica never thought that there would be life inside her. And that life was her baby with Henry Coles, the man she loved so much.

Shortly after getting into the car, her cell phone rang. A text message came in.

‘Come to Star Apartments, seventh-floor number seven. Now!’ The text message from Henry read.

Jessica was surprised when she read the message. In the two years she had been married to Henry, she had never once heard him mention the Star Apartment.

Even though she wondered, Jessica obeyed. She asked Nick, her driver, to drive her to the apartment.

Jessica leaned her head against the car window, which was wet from the afternoon rain. She observed the streets were deserted and only a few vehicles passed by.

Arriving at the Star Apartment, she said to Nick. “Just wait a bit. If I think I’ll be here long enough, I’ll ask you to go home first.”

“With whom you are going home, then?” Nick asked, sounding concerned.

“I’m going home with Henry,” she replied, adjusting the bag on her shoulder.

“Very well, ma’am. I’ll wait for your confirmation,” he replied.

Jessica hurried into the elevator. It was her first time coming to Star Apartments. From the outside, the building looked tall and imposing. However, her question now was. “Why did Henry ask her to come to the apartment? If there was something to talk about, couldn’t they have talked about it at home?”

Although filled with curiosity, Jessica stepped out of the elevator and walked towards room number seven quietly.

However, when she arrived at the door of the room, she heard several people talking and laughing loudly.

Is Henry inviting me to a party with his friends? Jessica thought.

Of course, Jessica would be thrilled if she was invited to a party by Henry and his friends because, in the two years of their marriage, Henry had never invited Jessica to any party. He always went alone and was rarely home. Of course, it made Jessica sad and lonely.

Jessica deliberately stood at the door without pressing the bell. She listened to their conversation, which turned out to be talking about her.

“So, Henry, what’s your next plan?” someone asked.

“Of course, he’s going to marry Cathy. They love each other. Besides, Cathy is pregnant right now, so soon Henry will be a father,” someone said.

“But what about your wife?” someone asked. Jessica’s heart started beating faster.

“Hmm, I already have a plan,” Henry replied firmly.

“We’d better not talk about her again. Henry and I are hoping you can help us prepare for the wedding of the century,” replied a woman’s voice that Jessica recognized as Cathy’s, her sister.

Jessica and Cathy were indeed sisters, except that Jessica was adopted as a baby. The Ford family had not had children for quite some time. Because the wife, Karen Ford, really wanted to hold a baby, they adopted a baby from an orphanage. Not long after that, Karen got pregnant and gave birth to Cathy. From then on, Jessica became an unwanted child, forever in Cathy’s shadow.

“Of course. We’re sure your wedding party will be the grandest in all of Valdirra,” someone replied, followed by loud laughter from everyone.

“Henry, where is your wife? Why isn’t she here yet?” someone asked.

“Soon,” Henry replied.

Jessica’s heart broke listening to their conversation. She knew Henry had never loved her. They might be physically close to each other, but Henry’s heart and mind were far away somewhere.

She has tried her best and done various ways to make Henry love her a little or see her sincerity. But all her efforts were in vain. She never won Henry’s heart.

At that moment, Jessica wanted to leave immediately and did not want to hear any more conversations about Henry and Cathy, or her. But suddenly her cell phone rang again. A text message from Henry came in.

‘Where are you? Hurry and get here,’ He wrote. Henry’s text message was cold.

In order not to cause any trouble, Jessica rushed to press the bell. Moments later, the door opened. A tall, bulky, slightly feminine-looking man stood in front of her.

“Henry, your wife is here,” he said as he walked away without letting Jessica in.

Jessica stepped into the grand living room. Henry and Cathy stood side by side. But what broke Jessica’s heart was Henry’s arm around Cathy’s waist. He treated her sister with love.

Envious. Jealous. That’s what Jessica felt at that moment.

“Sorry I’m late,” Jessica said, trying to smile despite the difficulty.

“I called you here because there’s an important matter we need to resolve right now,” Henry said.

Jessica stood still in the center of the room, waiting for the next words to come out of the mouth of the man she loved so much.

“Let’s get a divorce,” he said.

“Do you want a divorce to be happy?” Jessica asked, trying to hold back the tears that had filled her eyes.

“Yes. This marriage is not the marriage I wanted. I just want to be happy with the woman I love,” Henry replied firmly.

“Do you ever think about my happiness?” Jessica asked, holding back the pain in her heart. Every word that came out of Henry’s mouth was like a knife that sliced through every part of Jessica’s heart.

“Why are you asking me about your happiness?” Henry replied flatly. His face was expressionless and the answer he gave sounded indifferent.

Only one question came to Jessica’s mind. ‘In the two years they’ve been together, hasn’t there been even a hint of pity in Henry’s heart? Was she that worthless to him?’

Henry had called her to come to the Star Apartment just to ask for a divorce.

Jessica took the report about her pregnancy from her bag, then she tore the report into small pieces while laughing loudly and letting the clear liquid flow out of her eyes and wet her face.

“What are you tearing? Are you crazy?” Henry asked curiously.

Jessica didn’t answer and left without looking back.

# CH 2: The Pink Pendant

Jessica dashed towards the elevator while sobbing. The world and the hopes she had built up over the years were shattered. However, what hurt her even more was that Henry didn’t even give her the chance to tell him about her pregnancy.

She had thought that maybe the child in her womb could unite Henry with her. However, what happened that day made everything clear.

After the elevator doors closed, Jessica knelt. With both hands covering her face, she cried. Lamenting her life, she had never felt happiness since childhood.

Why did she always have to make the sacrifices? Why was she never loved, even by her adoptive parents?

Ever since she was a little girl, all the love and attention had been on Cathy. She always walked behind Cathy and stood away from her adoptive family as if the world had forgotten her.

All the best belonged to Cathy. Just like that moment. Henry, the man she loved, had to belong to Cathy, even though it was Henry’s grandfather and her adoptive parents who got her married to Henry. Why was everything turned upside down now?

Seeing Jessica get into the car, Nick turned his head. However, before he could ask, Jessica had said first. “Take me home.”

“Ok, ma’am,” Nick replied as he started the engine. Throughout the journey, Jessica’s face was downcast. She didn’t know what to do or where to go.

“Ma’am, are you okay?” Nick asked worriedly. He knew Jessica’s relationship with Henry had never been good.

“I’m fine,” Jessica replied briefly.

“Oh, alright. Glad to hear you’re okay,” Nick replied, trying to smile.

“Nick, you’ve been the Ford family driver for twenty-five years. When I was adopted by my adoptive parents, you worked for them. Do you know anything about my past or my actual family?”

Nick thought for a moment, his mind wandering back twenty-five years. He tried to remember every detail of the day when Ford’s husband and wife returned home with a baby girl.

“Ah, I remember. I accidentally saw you wearing a necklace with a heart-shaped pendant. The pendant was pink and made of gemstones. When I went into the house, I saw Mrs. Karen sitting in the living room. She took the necklace and put it in a box. I’m sorry, ma’am. I only know that much,” he replied.

“Thank you, Nick. That’s enough,” Jessica replied.

A pink pendant made of gemstones. Jessica never knew about the pendant’s whereabouts. That meant she had to visit the Ford residence and ask for the necklace back. She hoped it would bring her to her actual family.

“Nick, we’re not going home. Take me to Ford’s residence,” Jessica pleaded.

“Ok, ma’am,” Nick replied obediently.

Arriving at the Ford residence, after ringing the bell twice, a round-faced, short butler opened the door.

“Oh, Mrs. Coles. You’ve finally come here. I’ve missed you so much,” Rose said tearfully.

Jessica hugged Rose tightly. “I’ve missed you too, Rose.”

“Are Mom and Dad home?”

“They’re at the library,” Rose replied.

“Ok, I’ll be there now.”

“Tea or coffee? I’ll make a special drink for you,” Rose asked with a smile.

“Tea, please. Thank you.” Jessica left the kitchen for the library at the end of the hall. The Ford family library was Karen and Ben Ford’s favorite place to spend the afternoon.

Arriving at the library door, Jessica saw it was unlocked. She stepped inside slowly, looking around for her foster mother and father. However, they were not on the first floor. Jessica thought they might be on the second floor and among the large bookshelves.

However, just as Jessica was about to turn around and climb the stairs to the second floor, a voice startled her.

“You finally came,” Karen said, who was coming down the stairs carrying a stack of books. Jessica hurried to help her by carrying the stack of books and putting them on the large table in the center of the library.

“I’m sorry, I came unexpectedly. I have something to ask you,” Jessica replied.

“Say it,” Karen said while arranging the books.

“Umm. I want to know about the pink pendant.”

“Oh, you want to find your actual family? Ok, I’ll be frank. If I tell you and give you the pendant. Will you go away from Henry’s life forever? And let Cathy be happy with him?” Karen asked.

“So, you’ve heard the news.”

“Yes, Henry’s lawyer has sent the divorce papers to your house. If you agree, I’ll tell you everything,” she replied. Jessica saw no love in Karen’s eyes. She finally realized that she had been naïve in expecting a little love from her adoptive parents. She was never in their hearts.

“Ok,” Jessica replied sadly.

Karen walked over to the cabinet behind Ben Ford’s desk. After dialing six number codes, the cabinet opened. Then she took out a black box exactly as Nick had told her.

After closing the cabinet, Karen gave the black box to Jessica. She opened it and, sure enough, a pink, heart-shaped pendant was inside.

“When I adopted you from the Sun Orphanage, that pendant was around your neck. It wasn’t just any pendant. Only a wealthy family could afford to have a pendant like that gem. That’s all the information I have. Please, fulfill your promise, then I will be very grateful to you,” Karen pleaded.

“Alright, I won’t break my promise. Thanks for everything, Mom,” she replied simply as she left the library. Jessica left, smiling and crying at the same time. Crying over her sad fate. Even Karen didn’t want her.

From then on, Jessica was determined not to regret and cry over the past. It was time to find her actual family, even though the process might not be easy.

The first place she must visit was the Sun Orphanage. She hoped to find the true chronology of how she ended up at the orphanage.

After arriving home, Jessica rushed to pack all her belongings. And sure enough, an envelope was delivered to her house. Jessica opened the envelope and signed all the divorce documents without hesitation. For her, there was nothing to defend anymore.

She hurried away after putting the divorce documents on her dressing table. By now, she was at the gate of the orphanage. She pressed the bell a few times and soon, someone could be seen running from a distance towards the gate.

“Can I help you, Miss? May I know who you are?” a junior nanny asked.

“Hello, good afternoon. My name is Jessica Ford. May I see the head of the nanny?” Jessica asked. Her heart beat faster. She kept hoping that she would find her actual family soon.

# CH 3: Clues

The young nanny opened the gate and let Jessica’s car in. After parking the car, Jessica rushed out and approached the nanny.

“Come with me,” she said.

“Sorry to trouble you. My name is Jessica Ford,” Jessica replied, shaking the nanny’s hand.

“Sonya,” she replied with a smile.

Jessica walked after Sonya. That night, the orphanage looked deserted. The building looked big, but old. Some lights in the hallways were not even on.

Could it be that the orphanage is experiencing financial difficulties? Jessica thought.

It was obvious from the absence of gatekeepers and the unlit lights in some hallways. In addition, the building and furniture were outdated.

Arriving in a room, the nanny invited Jessica to sit down.

“Wait a minute, they’re having a service. Would you like tea or coffee?” the nanny asked.

“Tea, please. Thank you.”

It was so quiet, only the sounds of night animals kept Jessica company that night. She got up from her chair and walked around the room, observing the photos hanging on the walls, which were painted with dull paint. Most of the photos were of the nannies and children of the orphanage. Most of the photos were old photos that were turning yellow.

Engrossed in looking at each photo, Jessica didn’t realize that the door opened and someone entered the room.

“Those are our photos with the children who are now adults,” a voice said.

Spontaneously, Jessica turned around and looked at an old woman, quite tall and walking with the help of a cane in her right hand.

“S-sorry, I didn’t know you were coming in,” Jessica said nervously.

“It’s okay. Let’s have a seat,” she invited.

Jessica approached the old woman and extended her hand as she introduced herself. “Jessica Ford.”

“Anne. May I know what you’re here for?” she asked. Not long after, Sonya came in and placed two cups of tea on the table.

“Thank you, Sonya,” Anne said. Sonya hurried away and closed the door.

Jessica took out a pink pendant from her bag and showed it to Anne.

“Do you remember this pendant?” Jessica asked, curiously.

“Who are you? Are you the owner of the pendant?” Anne asked warily.

“I am the baby who wore this pendant on the day a Ford couple came here to adopt me. The purpose of my coming here is to ask about the actual family who left me here and the chronology of how I came to be here,” Jessica replied.

“Wait. I don’t remember every detail. I have to check the data of each family who adopted the child who was delivered here,” Anne replied. She stood up and walked to the large file cabinet behind her desk.

She opened drawer after drawer and read every inscription on the front of the folder. Just after opening the third drawer and taking out the fifth folder, Anne closed the drawer and said. “Ah, finally.” Then she sat back down in front of Jessica.

“This file only contains the name of the woman who brought you here, Martha Oswald, and the family who adopted you, the Ford. This is the file.”

Jessica took the file from the nanny’s hand and read every piece of information in it. However, there was no address for the woman named Martha. No information could lead her to her actual family.

“Do you know where this woman lives?”

“I’m sorry, I don’t know. The file only says that she lives in Maldiva. I can’t help you with any other information,” Anne replied.

“Ah, that’s okay. In that case, I will go to Maldiva now. Thank you.”

“But it’s getting late. Leave tomorrow morning. You can stay here overnight. Isn’t that better?” Anne said. Jessica looked out the window. The sky was already dark, and the journey to Maldiva would take a long time. Besides, she was already too tired. Maybe staying at the orphanage overnight would help her recharge her energies.

“Alright. Thank you for the offer,” Jessica replied happily.

However, that night Jessica could not close her eyes. Her mind would not let her rest. Her curiosity drove her to rush to find whatever information she could with just a name and the pendant.

Jessica tried to search through a website and read some articles about missing people. She hoped to find at least one article about her.

A few hours later, Jessica got a notification from her search results. And it connected her with two names, Maria and Martha Oswald. In addition, she also found an old article in the missing persons section. A family calling themselves the Oswald Family was looking for a baby girl with some characteristics mentioned. In the blurry picture of the article, Jessica saw a necklace with the same pendant as the one she was wearing. And even more encouraging, an address was listed on the website and article.

Early that morning, Jessica cried as she clutched the pendant tightly. One step away, she would soon meet her actual family. She just hoped she could find a home that would accept her well.

In the morning, after tidying up her room and enjoying breakfast with the nannies and children, Jessica said goodbye.

“Thank you, Anne, Sonya, and everyone here. I’m leaving now,” she said as she hugged them.

Anne took Jessica’s hand, looked into her eyes, and said. “Good luck. We hope you find your actual family soon and live happily with them.”

Clear liquid dripped down Jessica’s face. She wiped her face several times. “Thank you. I will visit you next time.”

Then she drove her car to Maldiva.

A few hours later, she was standing in front of a large and tall gate. She pressed the bell several times. Soon, a tall and thin man opened the gate with a wary look. He looked surprised and scrutinized her from head to toe.

“Mrs. Maria? No-no way. This must be someone who only looks like her,” the guard stammered.

“Excuse me, is this Martha and Maria Oswald’s house? Can I see them?” Jessica asked, surprised by the guard’s behavior.

“W-who are you? Why are you looking for Mrs. Martha and Maria?” he asked suspiciously. He looked at Jessica without blinking.

# CH 4: Gave Birth and Actual Family

“My name is Jessica Ford. I’m from the Sun Orphanage and I’m here to inquire about a child from the Ford Family who was entrusted to the orphanage. Please allow me to see them,” Jessica pleaded while holding back feelings of anxiety and restlessness.

Many questions popped up in her mind. Would the Oswald family accept her? Maybe the Oswald family put her into the orphanage for something. What if they didn’t take her? Where should she go?

“Ah, wait here. Don’t go anywhere,” the guard replied. He quickly went inside and appeared to be talking to his colleague. Their eyes were both staring at Jessica. Then, his colleague was seen running away in a hurry.

The guard came back out and opened the gate for Jessica. “Please park your car in the guest parking area.”

“Oh okay. Thank you,” Jessica replied with a big smile. She hurriedly got into her car and started the engine, humming happily.

‘One more step. God, please help me,’ Jessica muttered.

When she exited the car, Jessica saw a grand, classical-style building. Next to the building was a garden and next to the garden was a building with an open door.

“That’s the garage,” the guard said, who suddenly stood beside Jessica.

Jessica turned her head and breathed a sigh of relief. “You surprised me. I didn’t expect you to be standing next to me.”

The guard laughed and said. “Follow me.”

In the distance, the second guard could be seen running towards them. Arriving in front of the first guard, with the breathlessness of someone who has just finished circling the field several times, whispered into the first guard’s ear.

After a few minutes, the second guard left them and returned to the guardhouse. Meanwhile, the first guard accompanied Jessica inside.

In front of the main entrance stood a middle-aged woman, followed by two young maids standing behind her. All three of them wore pink uniforms of the same model.

“I’ll just drop you off here. Please follow them, Miss,” the first guard said.

“Ok, thank you,” Jessica replied kindly.

The middle-aged server had the same expression as the first guard. Her face showed a look of surprise when she saw Jessica’s face. This made Jessica believe that something was going on in the family.

Then, the middle-aged maid extended her hand and introduced herself. “Mia.”

Jessica welcomed Mia’s hand and replied. “Jessica Ford.”

“You look a lot like Mr. Oswald’s daughter. I was surprised when I first saw your face. I thought you were the same person,” Mia said with a small smile.

“The guard was also surprised when he saw me. May I know more about Martha and Maria?” she asked.

Mia turned her head and stopped walking. “I’m not at liberty to tell you that. Mr. Oswald will explain everything to you. Please sit here and wait a moment. I need to inform him about this.”

In an instant, Mia was out of Jessica’s sight. Now, there was only silence in the center of the spacious living room. No other servants were milling around Jessica.

Where are the servants? Is this a big house only inhabited by a few people? Jessica thought.

Moments later, Mia returned. “Come with me, Miss.”

“Okay.” Jessica quickly stood up and followed Mia as she walked to a room at the end of the hallway. As Jessica passed in front of each room, all the doors were locked.

Mia knocked on Mr. Oswald’s room as she said. “It’s me, Mia. We’re going in now.”

No answer came from inside, but Mia pressed the doorknob and pushed the door inward. The room was very spacious and, according to Jessica’s calculations, it might even accommodate up to six beds.

From a distance, Jessica saw an old man lying on the bed. Hearing us enter, the man turned his head and did not take his eyes off Jessica.

“Ma-maria,” he said.

Mia rushed over to the old man and tried to explain. “She’s not Mrs. Maria, sir. Her name is Jessica Ford. She has something to ask you.” The man nodded several times.

“Please sit here, miss,” Mia said as she placed a chair beside the old man’s bed.

“Thank you.”

Jessica took out an article about the missing baby from the Oswald family, along with a pink pendant.

When Jessica looked up, both the old man and Mia looked surprised. “Where did you get that necklace?”

“Are you looking for a baby girl who disappeared twenty-five years ago? And that baby was wearing a necklace with this heart-shaped pendant?”

“Yes. But,” Mia’s reply was cut short as the old man stopped her from explaining further.

“That necklace belonged to my daughter. She wore it on her baby. The day they went sightseeing, the car they were traveling in got into an accident. At the scene, only two burnt skeletons were found, and no trace of their baby. I searched all over the country for my missing granddaughter, but to no avail. How did you get the necklace?” the man asked.

“Is your daughter’s name Martha?” Jessica asked. Her heart was beating faster. She was convinced that the old man lying in front of her was her grandfather.

“Maria. Martha is her sister-in-law,” the old man replied.

“When I was adopted by the Ford, I wore this necklace. They adopted me from the Sun Orphanage. And it was only this necklace and the missing person article that brought me here. All this time, I knew nothing about my actual family. And my only purpose in coming here is for the truth behind everything,” Jessica said as she wiped the tears from her face.

“Sir, he’s Mrs. Maria’s daughter,” Mia said in surprise.

“Come here. If you are my granddaughter, you must have a circular, green birthmark on your back shoulder. Let me see that birthmark,” the old man pleaded.

Jessica walked up to the old man.

“May I?” Mia asked. Jessica nodded.

Mia removed the t-shirt covering Jessica’s shoulder, and she spontaneously yelled happily. “Sir, we have found Mrs. Maria’s baby.” After that, Mia fell to her knees in tears.",1,1753758073.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

My family is half German and half American. My mom grew up in a small town in Central Germany, while my dad grew up in the northern part of Minnesota. They met through a university in Pennsylvania, and I guess the rest is history. The first time I visited Germany was around the time I started to learn how to crawl, so you can't blame me when I say I don't remember any of it. However, since that first visit, I've been lucky enough to have gone almost 10 times. Since then, I have also become fluent in German, allowing me to embrace the culture given to me by my German heritage.

The name of this small town is Schwarzdorf which roughly translates to Dark Village. I never understood the meaning behind the name, as the town is far from Dark, and in reality, is exceptionally beautiful. Schwarzdorf is nestled between two mountains, perfectly positioned in the valley created by these tree-studded hills. The town's inhabitants are either at the age of announcing retirement or have families with a comically large amount of children. The surrounding area is brimming with trails, fields, farms, lakes, and parks, creating an environment of peace and tranquility, and every time I come back to visit and I appreciate the beauty more and more.

I had just finished my sophomore year of college, studying history at a small university in Arkansas. I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do with my degree, like most college students, but I was always told to study something I had a real interest in, so History was the direction I took. Did I think that I would become a millionaire from this degree choice? I did not, but at this age, my financial stability was no more than a practical joke. My family had planned a trip for the summer to Germany, as it had been a few years since the last time we visited. We had planned to visit the year before, but the world was hit by a pandemic (COVID-19 more specifically, everyone has heard of it), and soon after the feasibility of travel was nonexistent.

Conveniently though, the delay of our trip happened to align perfectly with a research paper I was going to submit the very next fall that focused on WWII. The class I needed to write this for was General World History and after consideration, I had chosen to focus broadly on Germany's involvement in the war. Our upcoming trip would help me to get first-hand accounts of what life in Germany was like during the war, and I figured that the more I knew the easier it would be to write the paper. Though that was true, I inadvertently uncovered secrets a normal college student like me shouldn't have been exposed to.

The flight to Germany from the United States is something I don't think I could ever get used to. Airplane seats, especially those in the economy class, are not built to accommodate people over six feet tall. I stand proudly at 6'2 and weigh around 215 lbs., meaning these twelve-hour flights are, in principle, a modern-day torture method. The duration of this flight felt like a lifetime, and to make matters worse the passenger in front of me had their seat fully leaned back from the time we reached our cruising altitude till the announcement of our descent came ringing over the intercom.

I will stand by my opinion that European public transportation has been the best thing to happen in Europe since the dawn of the industrial revolution. Being able to land in Germany, make your way through customs, and then walk out the exit to find a train station waiting for you, feels almost too good to be true. Even better, these trains take you all over the country and don't cost much more than the Big Mac Meal from McDonald's.

After my family and I had boarded our train, I finally was able to get comfortable and snooze for the remaining three hours of our trip. After being shaken awake by my visibly excited younger brother, I helped my family move our bags from the train to the platform, where Oma was already waiting for us, her gleeful smile making up close to two-thirds of her face. With greetings, hugs, and kisses out of the way, she led us to her small Ford Fiesta. If you have never seen a Ford Fiesta, they look like and are about the size of the cars you see a dozen clowns comedically climb out of at your local traveling circus.

Somehow my dad and I managed to turn fitting suitcases into the car, into a game of rudimentary Tetris. But the real challenge was fitting six people into a car that shouldn't seat more than four, already filled to the brim with luggage. Looking like sardines squeezed into a can, my two siblings, my dad and I piled into the back seat, while my mom sat like a Queen on her throne all alone in the front seat smiling while she caught up with her mother.

We drove towards town, and memories of summers spent here began to reappear in my mind. The late walks through the forest in the evenings, the sounds of wildlife, and the smells of delicious food excited me as we entered the town. My Oma's house was built on the side of the mountain, elevated from the rest of the town below. Her backyard stretched far and high, stopping at the first line of trees. It was peaceful where she lived, her house old but beautiful. Built from brick, its green color blended with the surrounding nature, turning it into a hidden paradise.

As we approached the door with our luggage, I felt at home. I spend many years of my life in this home and returning brought feelings of deep joy. After settling into my room in the far back corner of the house, I went downstairs to enjoy my first German meal of the trip. Five slices of bread, a couple of handfuls of chips, and a glass of cold sparkling water later, I was entering a food coma and knew I didn't have much longer till I would be a vegetable. Having finished saying my goodnights, I made my way back upstairs and slumped onto my bed. After finding my comfortable position, the lights in my head turned off and I passed into the realm of dreams.

A few days of hiking, swimming, enjoying German cuisines, and relaxing in nature passed as I began to truly settle in. I was very excited to get started on my project and begin hearing stories about life during WWII. I had asked my mom for advice, as I didn't know who I should talk to about the topic. I didn't want to come across as offensive or ignorant, because this was inherently a sensitive subject. She had told me that a majority of older Germans won't talk to you about the subject as they either will be offended or refuse to revisit the nightmares they lived through. Although my options were now minimal, I still had high hopes because the one person who would talk to me was my Oma, and as we all know you can't say no to family.

I will admit I was slightly nervous when the time came for me to approach my Oma about her experiences, but she was always kind to me and I couldn't imagine her rejecting my request. I scooped up my backpack from the floor of my room, and as I got to the top of the stairs, I smelled coffee and knew now would be the perfect time for the interview.

My Oma was in the kitchen preparing her afternoon coffee, traditionally followed by at least an hour of sitting on her outside patio, enjoying the cool weather and warm sun. I rounded the corner and entered the kitchen, asking her if it was Zeit fur Cafe Trinken, and she nodded in response asking me if I wanted a cup. (Zeit fur Cafe Trinken, literally translates to ""Time for Drinking Coffee).

Germans need their Cafe Trinke. It is a staple of their daily routine, and without it, their lives would quite literally crumble around them. The importance of Cafe Trinken to a German is like a Sunday night football game for Americans. Without it, they lose their minds. This meant that I would have plenty of time to pry some information out of her, which would, in turn, hopefully, give me a direction for my research paper.

We left the kitchen and headed to the outdoor patio, I walked slowly, carrying a tray containing several slices of cake, a coffee refill, and additional additives required to enhance the flavor of our coffee. One time, while doing this same task, I tripped on the edge of a door frame and went flying, spilling coffee, cake, and porcelain everywhere. The embarrassment was palpable, and since then walking slowly and carefully when carrying the tray became the only sensible thing to do.

After we had finished our initial cups and I had poured our second, I reckoned now was as good a time as ever to start the interview. Reaching into my backpack, I pulled out my laptop and opened my phone's voice memos app to record our conversation.

My Oma fixed her eyes on the items I had spread out before me (This conversation was in German, but I used my recording to translate it for you all. And just let me say, thank God I did record it)

""Am I in some sort of trouble?"" she said, playfully throwing her hands up as if she had been caught in the act.

""No Oma,"" I replied chuckling at her playful demeanor, before I spoke again to continue my original train of thought.

""I have this project for one of my History classes next semester at my University. My professor wants us to write a paper about WWII. His guidelines regarding the topic were loose, and eventually, I came across the idea of writing about Germany's involvement in the war.""

She leaned against the back of the chair before responding.

""And where do I come into this topic?""

""Well, Oma, I need one primary source for the paper, and I was hoping you would be that source. Would you be willing to answer a few questions I have?""

Folding her arms over her chest, she hesitated, visibly contemplating the response she would give me.

""I can help. Are your parents okay with you talking to me? Years ago, they expressed their distaste with my recounting of childhood stories to you and your siblings. I used to tell you three stories when you were young.""

I suddenly remembered us in the living room, seated around her fireplace, intently listening to stories of life during the war.

""Don't worry about Mama and Papa Oma; I've outgrown that request. They let me make my own decisions now, and in fact, encouraged the idea of talking with you.""

""Okay, if that's the case, let's get started.""

""Perfect, thank you, Oma. Before we begin let me preface by saying if any of my questions are too personal, let me know.""

""No question is too personal. Unlike my German counterparts, I enjoy talking about the war. I'm an open book; ask whatever you'd like.""

And an open book she was. I couldn't believe how easily she let the stories of death, destruction, and suffering flow from her lips. Each story had a crushing weight to it, and I could almost feel the pain audible in my Oma's voice.

An hour passed, and the coffee in our cups had gone cold, but our conversation had not. Oma had just finished telling me a story about the end of the war, and how American soldiers had come rolling down the cobblestone streets in their tanks, smiles of joy and relief pasted on their faces. She explained how they had been handing out Chocolate to the children, and how her older brother took it for himself instead of giving her the chocolate.

The Word document I used to jot down notes was over two pages long, signaling that I should wrap up this interview. However, I still had one question I wanted to ask my Oma, and this question, out of all the questions I had asked, was the only one that made me nervous.

Finishing up the story of the Americans on Tanks, my Oma rubbed her hands on her thighs and then asked me,

""How was that? Enough to fill your paper?""

""Yeah, I feel like I'm pretty close. Thank you for telling me your stories.""

I hesitated momentarily before asking the question that weighed down my thoughts.

""Oma, I've got one more question if you have more time for me.""

She repositioned herself in the chair and then said,

""Sure, what else would you like to know?""

There was a brief silence following her question, and as I moved uncomfortably in my chair, I suddenly let the question go.

""Oma, did you see a lot of the Jewish Communities Genocide in your town?""

She hesitated, drew in a long breath, and then replied.

""Pat, before I answer, I need you to listen to me. Everything I say from this point forward does not get brought up in front of your parents. Is that clear?""

Her tone was serious, and I felt a chill run down my spine as I saw the fear that hid behind her light blue eyes, which were starting to fade with age.

""Yes, Oma, I won't say a thing. I promise.""

What is she going to tell me? Is it something I shouldn't know? I returned my fingers to my keyboard and waited for her to speak again.

""I was seven when the first Nazis showed up in Schwazdorf. I remember the hushed whispers and secret conversations my parents and relatives would have around the dinner table. You didn't have to be a genius to understand something was wrong. At first, they were only moving supplies through the town and into the mountains. Everyone thought they were setting up a military base hidden in the forest because of the dense tree canopy.""

She paused here, taking a long breath as if preparing for what she would say next.

“Then the Jewish Community that lived in the town started to disappear. At first, it was almost unnoticeable: a family here and a family there. Then, they began to fade in more significant numbers; apartments occupied by families of the Jewish Community would be breaming with life, and then overnight, they’d be empty, leaving rows of eerily silent buildings.""

As she finished this sentence, I realized her story would be far darker, more depressing, and heavier than anything else said in the past hour. The discomfort was visible in my body language, and I could see that she was also seriously starting to struggle with the account. Before I could interrupt and give her a chance to stop, she spoke again, saying,

""It only took a matter of weeks before our Jewish community had vanished in thin air. The gravity of the situation silenced any outcry our town had against the sudden disappearances, and the Nazi presence only added to the intense feelings running rampantly through the community. One afternoon, as I sat on this same patio with my family, the sound of an engine stopping at the bottom of our hill hit my ears. I turned to look over my shoulder and saw a lone nazi soldier, decked out in his black and red uniform, walking up the hill toward our home. My father stood up and called in his direction, asking what business he had here. Instead of responding, the soldier simply approached my father, handing him a sheet of paper, my father read it over, then crumpled it in his large hands and walked inside.""

""And what did it say, Oma?"" I asked, perched on the edge of my seat, fully enthralled by the story flowing out of my Oma's mouth.

""My father didn't show any of us what it said. To this day, I still don't know. He burned it first thing when he got inside. However, he was soon gone every morning, returning long after the sun laid its head to rest. There were times I'd hear him come in, take off his shoes, speak to my mother, then break into heaving sobs. Something was seriously wrong; terror had taken our family by force.""

A lone tear rolled down Oma's cheek as she once again took a deep breath.

""The day those tanks came rolling into town was the same day whatever job my dad had with the Nazis came to an end. But its effects were only beginning. Slowly, my father began to deteriorate. At first, it was his silence. He rarely spoke anymore, and the fun-loving nature he had was gone. Then, he stopped eating as much. Meals for him consisted of sitting and staring at his plate. Next came the screams and sobs in the night, echoing from a place of deep despair and guilt.""

Another breath broke the silence that now hovered over the table. She spoke again, saying,

""One beautiful Sunday morning, I awoke to screams from my mother's bedroom. I ran as fast as I could down the hall towards her room, and when I rounded the corner, I saw him. He had shot himself. I won't forget the sight; nothing will ever tear me apart like that horrific, bloody scene that presented itself to me at the foot of my parent's bed. I saw next to him a note, handwritten and full of mystery. I grabbed it off the floor and ran to my room to hide, intent on discovering why my father had done this.""

There was an odd silence, as she tried to muster the strength to tell me the message. I was afraid that I was pushing her too far, and felt like I should stop her from continuing.

""Oma, should we stop? I feel like I'm pushing you too far.""

""No Pat, it's okay. The message I read written by my father that morning said: My family, I'm sorry for what I will do. You didn't deserve this, and to be fair, neither did I. What I was forced to do under the weight of the Nazis has secured me a place in hell. I can't forgive myself for what I did in those mountains. Please understand that I did this to end the suffering that plagued my mind. I love every one of you and will always be with you. Life is cruel, and I was dealt a bad hand. Stay safe, and forever remember me. I won't forget those words. I can only hope that my father has found peace. His decision had a lasting impact on my family, but I know he is in a better place now.""

I paused to take in the story that had unfolded itself to me. The mountains? What job did my great-grandfather have in the mountains?

""Oma, what did your father's note say about the mountains? Did he work in them?""

""Yes, as far as we know, the job he was given drew him deep into the mountains. Many other men in our town told stories of the hills, but nothing was ever proven. Some said there are secret bunkers with entrances hidden in the dense forest. I tried many times as a kid to find those bunkers, but I never could. Others claimed they would hear faint screams from the mountain at night, but it is nothing more than superstition. What we do know though, is something did happen in those mountains, and whatever happened destroyed the lives of many.""

This now felt like a good stopping point, so I closed my laptop and slid the items into my backpack to signal the end of the interview.

""Is that enough now?"" Oma asked me while standing up and placing the dishes on the tray.

""Yes, Oma, honestly, thank you so much. That must have been hard, but I have the perfect story for my paper. I'll find a way to get you a copy.""

She smiled and nodded, which was her typical response when leaving. Resting in my chair, I let the knowledge I now possessed wash over me. One thought rested at the forefront of my mind, and it concerned the bunkers. If I could find those bunkers, I could write the best paper my professor has ever seen. I suddenly felt like a kid again, filled with excitement and hope. There was a mystery to solve, and this time I would play the role of Sherlock Holmes. I wanted to know where the entrance to the mountain was and what had happened deep in its walls so many years ago.

Just as I was standing up to head inside, my Oma returned to the patio, holding something small in her hand.

""Pat, I thought you should see this, it might be interesting to have in your paper.""

She handed me a photo, old and stiff, yellowing at the edges. It was a picture of Schwarzdorf from before the war. Positioned perfectly in frame was the mountain, and the way it towered over the town sent chills down my spine.

""Oma this is amazing, can I snap a picture of it?"" I said enthralled by the image on the table in front of me.

""Of course. Just bring it back in with you when you are done out here, I'm going to be in the Kitchen preparing dinner.""

After dinner, I lay in bed, planning my exploration for the following day. I was determined to find the entrance to the bunkers and would prepare myself to do so. Nothing would stop me from uncovering this hidden part of history, and part of me also felt like I owed it to my family to find out what drove my great-grandfather insane. As I ran a mental checklist of what I would need in the morning, I felt sleep creeping into my body, and soon I was fast asleep.",1,1753758009.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

The shop is closed, the last email has been answered, but your day is far from over. You’re bathed in the blue glow of your laptop, staring at a spreadsheet with at least seventeen tabs. Website visitors, bounce rate, time on page, social media engagement, email open rates, cost per click, inventory turnover… the list scrolls on and on.

You feel like you *should* understand what it all means. You’re supposed to be a “data-driven” business owner, right? But if you’re being honest, it’s just noise. It’s overwhelming, confusing, and it leaves you with more questions than answers. What do you do with this information? What actually matters?

If this scene feels painfully familiar, take a deep breath. I want you to step away from that monster spreadsheet and consider a different approach. A simpler, more powerful way to understand the health and trajectory of your business.

What if you could get a crystal-clear picture of your business’s performance in less than five minutes a day? What if, instead of drowning in a sea of data, you could focus on just a handful of numbers that tell you almost everything you need to know to make smart, profitable decisions?

This isn't a fantasy. It’s the reality for a growing number of savvy entrepreneurs who have adopted a ""minimalist metrics"" approach. They’ve cut through the clutter and identified the vital signs of their business.

I call them **Focus Metrics**. And for most small businesses, there are only three you need to track daily. That's it.

This is the minimalist's guide to metrics: a simple, actionable framework to help you tune out the noise and tune into what truly drives growth. It’s time to build your simple business dashboard and reclaim your sanity.

# The Tyranny of ""More Data""

Before we dive into our magic number three, let's address the elephant in the room: the myth that more data is always better. We live in an age of analytics. Tools like Google Analytics, social media dashboards, and accounting software can generate an endless stream of reports. Consultants and marketing gurus preach the gospel of ""big data,"" making small business owners feel inadequate if they aren't tracking every conceivable key performance indicator (KPI).

This is a trap.

For a small business owner, time and attention are your most precious, non-renewable resources. Every minute you spend trying to decipher a complex report is a minute you *aren't* spending on selling, serving customers, improving your product, or leading your team.

The goal isn't to collect the most data; it's to collect the *right* data and act on it. **Minimalist metrics** are about identifying the few numbers that have a disproportionate impact on your success. These are your **daily KPIs**—the numbers that, if they move in the right direction, almost guarantee the business is healthy and growing.

So, what are these three mystical numbers? While the *exact* metrics can vary slightly depending on your business model (a SaaS company might track slightly different things than a coffee shop), they almost always fall into three critical categories:

1. **Activity & Revenue:** Are we making money *today*?
2. **Efficiency & Growth:** How effectively are we attracting new customers?
3. **Happiness & Retention:** Are our customers happy, and will they come back?

Let's break down the most common and powerful metric for each category.

# Focus Metric #1: Daily Sales Revenue

**What it is:** This one is beautifully simple. It's the total amount of money you brought in from sales in a single day. Not profit, not bookings, but top-line revenue.

**Why it's a vital daily KPI:** Daily Sales Revenue is the pulse of your business. It’s the most direct, unfiltered measure of your daily activity. It tells you if people are walking into your store, visiting your website, and, most importantly, pulling out their wallets.

Tracking this daily allows you to see immediate patterns. Did that new marketing campaign you launched yesterday actually work? Is a rainy day really killing your foot traffic? Does your revenue spike on Fridays? When you look at this number every single day, the rhythm of your business becomes second nature. You develop an intuitive feel for what's normal and can spot problems—or opportunities—the moment they arise.

**How to Track It:** This should be the easiest number to get. Your point-of-sale (POS) system (like Square or Toast), e-commerce platform (like Shopify or WooCommerce), or payment processor (like Stripe or PayPal) will tell you this with a single click.

**Building Your Simple Business Dashboard:** Don't overcomplicate it. You can start with a simple notebook on your desk, a whiteboard in your office, or a basic Google Sheet.

* **Column 1:** Date
* **Column 2:** Daily Sales Revenue
* **Column 3:** Notes (e.g., ""Ran Facebook ad,"" ""Holiday weekend,"" ""New product launch"")

This ""Notes"" column is your secret weapon. It provides context to the numbers. After a few weeks, you'll be able to scroll through and see exactly what actions led to spikes or dips in revenue.

**Best Practices & Tips:**

* **Look for Trends, Not Just Numbers:** Don't panic over one bad day. The power of daily tracking is in observing the trend over a week or a month. Are your daily averages trending up or down?
* **Set a Daily Goal:** Establish a baseline ""good day"" revenue number. This gives you a clear target to aim for and makes it easy to see if you're on track.
* **Segment if Necessary:** If you have multiple distinct revenue streams (e.g., in-store sales vs. online sales, or coffee vs. merchandise), it might be worth tracking them as two separate numbers. But be careful! The goal is simplicity. Only do this if both streams are significant and behave differently.

# Focus Metric #2: Leads or First-Time Customers

**What it is:** This metric measures the engine of your growth. It's the number of new potential customers you attracted today. Depending on your business, this could be:

* **For a local service business (plumber, landscaper):** The number of phone calls or web form submissions.
* **For a restaurant or retail store:** The number of *new* customers (which can be estimated or tracked via a loyalty program).
* **For an e-commerce store:** The number of new email subscribers or first-time buyers.
* **For a B2B consultant:** The number of discovery calls booked.

Choose the one that sits at the very top of your sales funnel. It's the first signal that your marketing is working.

**Why it's a vital daily KPI:** Sales revenue tells you what happened today, but your lead/new customer count tells you what's likely to happen tomorrow, next week, and next month. It’s a forward-looking indicator of your business's health. If you're consistently generating new leads, you have a pipeline of future revenue. If this number dries up, your sales will inevitably follow, even if you're having a good revenue day today.

Tracking this daily forces you to think constantly about marketing and sales activities. It separates the *act* of marketing (posting on social media, sending an email) from the *result* (getting a new lead).

**How to Track It:** This might require a little more setup than sales revenue, but it's worth it.

* **Web Forms:** Your website platform (WordPress, Squarespace) or a dedicated tool like Zapier can automatically log every form submission into a Google Sheet.
* **Phone Calls:** Use a call tracking service or simply have your receptionist keep a manual tally.
* **E-commerce:** Your platform (like Shopify) can easily generate a daily report of new customers.
* **Email Signups:** Your email marketing provider (like Mailchimp or ConvertKit) shows you this on your main dashboard.

**Building Your Simple Business Dashboard:** Add this to your existing sheet.

* **Column 1:** Date
* **Column 2:** Daily Sales Revenue
* **Column 3:** New Leads / First-Time Customers
* **Column 4:** Notes

Now your dashboard tells a more complete story. You can see the relationship between your marketing efforts (noted in Column 4), the immediate result (leads in Column 3), and the eventual payoff (revenue in Column 2).

**Best Practices & Tips:**

* **Define ""Lead"" Clearly:** Be consistent. If a lead is a web form submission, don't count a social media DM one day and not the next. Consistency is key.
* **Understand Your Sales Cycle:** How long does it take for a new lead to become a paying customer? Knowing this helps you predict future revenue. If you got 10 great leads today and your sales cycle is one week, you can feel confident about next week's sales.
* **Focus on Quality, Not Just Quantity:** While this is a numbers game, not all leads are created equal. As you get more advanced, you might start qualifying leads (e.g., ""qualified lead"" vs. ""just browsing""), but to start, just counting them is a massive step forward.

# Focus Metric #3: A Measure of Customer Happiness

**What it is:** This is the most overlooked of the three, but it might be the most important for long-term survival. This metric answers the question: ""Did we do a good job today?"" It measures customer satisfaction and the likelihood of repeat business and referrals.

The gold standard here is the **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**, which is based on a single question: ""On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend our business to a friend or colleague?""

* **Promoters (9-10):** Your loyal fans who will drive referrals.
* **Passives (7-8):** Satisfied but unenthusiastic; vulnerable to competitors.
* **Detractors (0-6):** Unhappy customers who can damage your brand.
* **Your NPS Score = % Promoters - % Detractors.**

However, you don't need a formal NPS system to start. You can use a simpler, daily proxy:

* **Number of 5-Star Reviews:** Track how many you get each day on Google, Yelp, or your industry-specific site.
* **Positive Mentions on Social Media:** A simple search for your brand name.
* **Direct Customer Feedback:** A simple ""How did we do today?"" card with a smiley face and a frowny face by the exit. Tally the results.

**Why it's a vital daily KPI:** It's far cheaper to keep an existing customer than to acquire a new one. Happy customers come back, spend more, and tell their friends. Unhappy customers not only leave, but they also tell everyone they know about their bad experience.

Tracking a happiness metric daily keeps the customer experience at the forefront of everything you do. It turns customer service from a reactive ""put out the fires"" department into a proactive ""create delight"" engine. When your whole team knows you are tracking this, it changes behavior. The barista tries a little harder, the technician cleans up a little more carefully, the support email is written with a little more empathy.

**How to Track It:** This is about creating a simple feedback loop.

* **Automated Emails:** Set up an automated email to go out a day after a purchase or service, asking the NPS question. Tools like Delighted, SurveyMonkey, or even a simple Google Form can manage this.
* **Review Monitoring:** Use a free tool like Google Alerts or simply bookmark your review pages and check them daily.
* **In-Person:** A low-tech feedback box or a simple verbal check-in from your staff. ""Did you find everything you were looking for today?""

**Building Your Simple Business Dashboard:** Let's complete our dashboard.

* **Column 1:** Date
* **Column 2:** Daily Sales Revenue
* **Column 3:** New Leads / First-Time Customers
* **Column 4:** Happiness Score (e.g., # of 5-star reviews, NPS)
* **Column 5:** Notes

This is it. This is your **simple business dashboard**. In five columns, you have a complete, 360-degree view of your business: your present (revenue), your future (leads), and your foundation (customer happiness).

**Best Practices & Tips:**

* **Act on the Feedback:** This is the most important part. When you get a negative review or a detractor score, reach out *immediately*. A swift, personal response can often turn a detractor into a promoter.
* **Celebrate the Wins:** Share the positive reviews and high scores with your team. It’s a powerful motivator and reinforces what a ""good job"" looks like.
* **Don't Fear the Bad Feedback:** Negative feedback is a gift. It's a free consultation showing you exactly where to improve your business. Embrace it.

# Putting It All Together: The 5-Minute Daily Huddle

Imagine this new routine. You come in each morning, grab your coffee, and open your simple business dashboard. You spend three minutes plugging in yesterday's numbers.

* **Daily Sales:** $2,150. (Good, above our $2k goal).
* **New Leads:** 8. (Solid, on track for our weekly goal).
* **Happiness:** One new 5-star review, zero negative feedback. (Excellent).

In less than five minutes, you know you had a great day. You can get on with your work, confident and focused.

Now imagine a different day:

* **Daily Sales:** $1,200. (Ouch, way below goal).
* **New Leads:** 2. (Yikes, that's really low).
* **Happiness:** One new 3-star review mentioning a slow checkout process. (Okay, there's a clue).

This isn't a disaster; it's an action plan. The numbers aren't there to make you feel bad; they're there to tell you where to focus your attention. Your five-minute check-in immediately prompts critical questions:

* ""Why were leads so low yesterday? Did our ad stop running? Is the contact form on the website broken?"" (Check the ad campaign and the website).
* ""The low sales were likely due to the low lead count, but the 3-star review points to an operational issue. Is our checkout process really too slow? Let's observe it today."" (Talk to the team, run a test transaction).

This is the power of **focus metrics**. They don't give you all the answers, but they ensure you are asking the right questions. They transform you from a reactive firefighter into a proactive, strategic business owner.

# Your Mission: Find Your Three Numbers

The beauty of this framework is its flexibility. The three categories—Activity, Growth, and Happiness—are universal. Your specific metrics might be slightly different, and that's okay.

* A content creator might track **Ad Revenue**, **New Subscribers**, and **Average View Duration**.
* A SaaS company might track **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**, **New Trial Signups**, and **Customer Churn Rate**.
* A non-profit might track **Donations**, **New Donors**, and **Volunteer Engagement**.

The key is to choose the three metrics that best represent the health of *your* specific business model and to commit to tracking them every single day.

Stop letting your business happen *to* you. Stop drowning in data and start making it work for you. Build your simple business dashboard today. Identify your three focus metrics, track them religiously, and watch as the fog of uncertainty lifts, replaced by the clarity and confidence you need to build the business you've always dreamed of.

Always went out of his way to say hello, we had flirty banter, he stared A LOT, and would try and get my attention so he could smile and wave. I never asked if he was single as it felt like a fun flirty crush and he didn’t seem to want to pursue anything either. 

I hadn’t seen him in a while but bumped into him last week again. He wasn’t paying me any attention like usual (lol) which was fine. I tried to smile and wave but got nothing back. We usually chat by the warm up area/exit so admittedly I hung around packing up slooooowly when I saw him leaving in case he wanted to chat, but no deal, he just left without a word.

He went into the coffee shop next to the gym which is also my favourite coffee shop, and I didn’t want to be weird and avoid him so I went to say hi and made a joke about following him. He was very standoffish, avoiding eye contact and just generally seemed uncomfortable so I left him alone after a couple of minutes. 

I’m worried I’ve creeped him out and he thinks I was following him or coming onto him too strong. Especially as I said things like ‘Hey this is my favourite coffee shop too, shame I’ve never run into you’ and ‘Haven’t seen you in a while where have you been hiding?’ It’s 100% fine if he’s not interested and whilst I do feel rejected, more importantly I just don’t want to weird him out or make him so uncomfortable that he’s scared to ever speak or say hi again?

I plan to officially start on August 5th. I've ordered 9 bags of Huel Black Edition, an order of the chocolate peanut butter R2D shakes, and Daily Greens. I am a big fan of the chocolate and banana powder, especially when mixed. I did get 1 bag of coffee caramel and 1 bag of salted caramel to try, as well as daily greens original flavor. The plan is 4-5 shakes a day to be around 1600-2000 calories and to moderately increase my activity level, as well as a daily greens in the morning.

I have gotten wayyyyy out of shape over the last 6-7 years due to a seizure disorder that has recently gotten much better after having a bit of brain removed. I am doing and feeling a lot better! I have been occasionally replacing meals with Huel and have previously tried the daily greens out for about a month, maybe two. I want to incorporate Huel into my normal daily diet and want to start that by doing a 30-day Huel challenge.

This is the heaviest I have ever been, but only by about a pound. When I was younger, I lost 125lbs to join the military, going from 295lbs down to 170lbs, and did a fairly decent job keeping it off until a few years after I separated and started having seizures and caring a lot less about diet and exercise.

During this challenge, I am only hoping to lose somewhere in the ballpark of 30-40 pounds. Cutting all the junk out and going solely on Huel, water, and black coffee. Going to be working for my dad during the challenge as a means of exercise, doing a lot of manual labor outside, and that sounded like a great way to boost my activity level until I can get a solid exercise routine worked back into my days.

After finishing the challenge, I will continue to have 2-3 shakes a day, followed by a healthy solid dinner. As I progress through the challenge, I am going to get my hands on a couple of pieces of exercise equipment I like to use, resistance bands, push-up board, either a roller or machine for core workouts, to work into a consistent daily routine. The ultimate goal is to lose 80lbs or at least a minimum of 60lbs.

If anyone has any tips or suggestions to ease my way through this challenge, about the diet, I am open to any you're willing to share. I have seen people mention fatigue and using a little salt in the shakes to help remedy it, and wondering if that was a common occurrence for people who have tried this. I am Male, 5' 9"", 296lbs.

I may post regular updates but will, at the very least, post an end of challenge update September 5th/6th. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read/interact.",2,1753757500.0,Huel,0,0.76,False

I figured it would be a good way to get out on a weekend since I WFH and do something positive. I worked up an appetite volunteering and I went nearby to a food hall to grab some lunch.

Overall it was a fun experience. I got to chat with a few of the volunteers and I really enjoyed getting to socialize and help a good cause. I'm already signed up for a few more weekend shifts and wondering if there are any other like minded people on here looking to connect and make a difference. 

Best case scenario we can grab a bite, coffee, or drink after. Worst case, you got to volunteer and make a difference for people in need.

I understood your moods, even when others found it difficult and did not. When I was cold, holding your hand was my favorite way to warm up and get hot 🥵. 

Your smile was like a rainbow that filled up the room. Dispelling all my depression and gloom. I loved to see your teeth in your smile. Making you smile was my favorite pastime, always worth my while 😁.

Now that your gone, as if there never was a you. My days are gray and dull, no longer joyful under skies of blue🦋. I see beautiful flowers in the sun, and they remind me of your beautiful face. I have now slowed down, running so fast like life was a race . It’s a marathon not a sprint, I would love to sit and have coffee, one more picnic, one more smile under the moon or sun. I know I will laugh again, I can’t help but reflect on our past youth of fun. With you time stood still, we could chill, enjoying the fullness of the movement I no longer had to run 🏃‍♂️.

Your punishment, exile to the worst of places. You will live out the remainder of your days on the planet known as Earth. I pity you","The low hum of the alien ship outside the Oval Office window felt less like a sound and more like a permanent vibration in the back of President Marcus Thorne's teeth. It had hung there for weeks, a vast, silent, obsidian tear-drop, casting its enormous shadow over Washington D.C. like a cosmic judgment. Inside, the White House's antiquated air conditioning unit was fighting a losing battle against the sheer, radiating (exhaust from ship.)
 President Thorne had seen a lot of long days in this office. Global pandemics, economic freefalls, that one time a rogue squirrel declared war on the Rose Garden's entire daffodil crop. But this? This was a whole new category of ""Monday.""
The three Judges floated opposite his desk, their forms shifting like polished smoke given solid shape. They called themselves the Luminaries, though most of Earth had just settled on ""The Gloom-Heads"" due to their perpetually disappointed expressions. Their spokesman, Judge Klar, solidified slightly, its three luminous eyes focusing on Thorne with an intensity that usually made even hardened generals suddenly need to use the restroom.
""President Thorne,"" Klar began, its voice a dry, rasping whisper that seemed to emanate from the very air itself. ""Our final assessments are complete.""
Marcus resisted the urge to rub his temples. ""And? Are we finally getting that intergalactic trade agreement? The one with the cheap fusion cells? Because frankly, our energy grid is starting to look like a spaghetti factory after a explosion.""
Klar's light-form rippled, a clear sign of alien exasperation. ""The data collected over your planet's observation cycle is conclusive. And frankly, deeply disturbing.""
""Observation cycle?"" Thorne leaned back in his chair, a tired, wry smile playing on his lips. ""You mean your little reality show? The one where we didn't know we were being filmed for three centuries?""
""It was intended as an educational sociological study,"" Klar corrected, its voice tight. ""A 'live-action chronicle of nascent intelligence' was the original project brief. Over time, it devolved into… well, this."" One of its spectral hands gestured vaguely at the planet outside the window, as if indicating a particularly stubborn stain.
""Yeah, we get it,"" Marcus muttered. ""Humans suck. We've heard the speech.""
""Your species,"" another Judge, named Zyra, chimed in, its voice higher, like grinding gravel, ""exhibits an unparalleled capacity for self-deception, petty conflict, and a baffling devotion to inefficiency. Your 'happiness' often correlates with 'obtaining more shiny objects than one's neighbor.' Your 'justice' is applied arbitrarily. Your 'global cooperation' extends to exactly two things: complaining about the weather, and blaming other species for your own shortcomings.""
Marcus sighed. ""Fair enough. We did try to blame you for the last big oil spill.""
""Indeed. Despite the fact that it was caused by one of your 'oil tankers' impacting a particularly stubborn 'iceberg',"" Klar intoned, its whisper laced with profound disappointment. ""And the ensuing blame-shifting monologue from your 'Secretary of Energy' was widely regarded as the lowest point of the entire third galactic cycle of the Sentient Species Survey.""
""So, what's the verdict?"" Marcus asked, cutting to the chase. ""Are we getting evicted? Forced to join the Galactic Federation and finally learn how to use a universal translator without setting off an alarm?""
Klar solidified fully, its light-form almost painfully bright. The other two Judges, Zyra and Orin, mirrored its stance. ""Humans! For your gravest of crimes – your persistent squabbling, your baffling adherence to self-destructive narratives, your species-wide embrace of illogical whimsy, and your utter refusal to conform to even the most basic tenets of galactic civility – we have found you guilty.""
Marcus braced himself. This was it. The big, universe-shattering punishment.
""Your punishment,"" Klar continued, its voice dropping to a near-inaudible thrum that filled the room with chilling finality, ""the greatest indignity we can conceive of for a species of your... peculiar nature, shall be exile. You will live out the remainder of your days on the worst of places.""
A long, dramatic pause. Marcus waited. Was it a black hole? A dimension of pure bureaucracy?
""You will live out the remainder of your days on the planet known as Earth.""
The silence that followed was absolute. For a moment, Marcus thought he might have misheard. He glanced at his weary Chief of Staff, a pragmatic woman named Sarah, who merely blinked.
Klar's light dimmed, almost sorrowfully. ""We pity you. You, who will know only its primitive squalor, its chaotic weather patterns, its inexplicable reliance on archaic communication devices, its endless, pointless conflicts over arbitrary lines in the dirt. No universal nutrient paste. No instantaneous travel. No harmonious thought-nets. Only... Earth. We have severed all interstellar relays. Your 'show' is concluded. We are leaving.""
Marcus stared at the Judges. They genuinely pitied him. They saw Earth not as a home, but as a cage of endless, mundane torment. They saw its petty wars, its idiotic social media trends, its climate change denial, its queues for lukewarm coffee, its constant, low-level irritation. And they found it the perfect, most soul-crushing punishment.
A slow, wry smile spread across Marcus's face. ""You know what?"" he said, looking from the glowing aliens to the familiar, worn wood of his desk. ""That sounds about right. No more alien overlords judging our snack preferences. No more trying to explain why we prefer arguing to 'harmonious thought-nets.'"" He pushed himself up from the chair. ""Sarah, call a press conference. Tell the world the aliens broke up with us because we're too much work.""
Klar seemed to ripple with a new, alien confusion. ""You... accept this punishment?""
Marcus shrugged, walking to the window and looking out at the sprawling, messy, beautiful, infuriating city of Washington D.C. ""Accept it? Judge, this isn't punishment. This is just Tuesday. With less space-traffic. Welcome home, I guess.""
The three Judges flickered, their forms momentarily losing cohesion, overwhelmed by the baffling simplicity of humanity's grim acceptance. With a final, faint hum that spoke of profound disappointment and utter bewilderment, the alien ship outside began to slowly, silently ascend, leaving Earth, and its inexplicable, messy inhabitants, to their perfect, chaotic, utterly unpunishable fate.

I've modeled, styled and photographed, though I never had to hide my face. So, that in itself has created it's own challenges. But I've found some ways to keep my artistic ideas creative and fun while also maintaining my anonymity. Obviously, there are always chances of being found, but it is what it is. I've spent a lot of time researching poses, lighting, etc. over the years and thought I'd share some tips!

* Use Pinterest. There are a TON of boudoir poses that hide your face and accentuate your body.
* PROPS! My most recent photoset involved a $5 sheer curtain I found in a thrift store. Candles, books, newspapers, coffee mugs, flowers, pillows/blankets, masks (I'm not fond of them but I do love masquerade masks), even mirrors!
* Use lighting to your advantage. To create a silhouette, have a light source behind you, turn the exposure down on your camera and bam! Full body and no face. Shadows are sexy, too! Use your ring light to its maximum potential!
* Set up your space like a little studio. Invest in a cheap, solid color backdrop and a tripod. You can absolutely create stunning content on a phone with the right tools!
* Circling back to thrift stores! You don't have to drop $100s on lingerie to be sexy. There are a thousand things you can use. A sheer blouse, bodysuits (are hot!), lacy fabric to drape over your frame (and also hide things you don't want seen). Goodwill is an excellent place for heels that don't cost a fortune. You can make anything look elegant if you have the right attitude!

That's all I have for now, but if I think of anything more, I'll add to it.

My suit feels tight, the fabric of my skirt too stiff as it rubs against my legs. I tug at the hem as I follow my supervisor, Martin, down the polished hallway of the office building. The air smells like expensive coffee and something faintly floral. I wish I could just blend into the walls.

“You’ve got this, Nichole,” Martin’s voice pulls me from my thoughts. He’s so calm, so effortlessly confident. I can’t help but admire the way he walks like he’s in charge of the world. Meanwhile, I’m just hoping I don’t spill my water or, god forbid, trip over my own heels.

I glance down at my phone, just to check the time, even though I’ve already checked it five times in the last ten minutes. We’re supposed to meet with a potential investor for one of our upcoming projects a new mixed-use development that’s going to transform an entire neighborhood. A huge deal. The kind of deal that could make or break my career. No pressure, right?

Martin pauses by the elevator, giving me a quick glance over his shoulder. “You’re looking sharp. Remember, you’re here to learn, not just to impress.”

I swallow hard, the words not doing anything to settle my nerves. ""Right, learning. Got it.""

The elevator dings, and the doors slide open. Inside, I cling to the railing like it’s my lifeline. I know I’m overthinking it, but the thought of sitting across from someone important, trying to sound like I belong, is like trying to pretend I’m a grown-up when I still feel like a kid in a suit. My heart beats a little faster when I imagine how I’ll sound. I’ll probably end up saying something stupid.

When we reach the restaurant a sleek, modern spot with high ceilings and a cool ambiance I step out and let the cool air hit my face, hoping it’ll calm me down. I catch a glimpse of the investor, you, before Martin even says anything. You’re sharp-dressed sitting at a corner booth, surrounded by glossy black leather chairs. You look exactly like what I imagine when I think of an investor: confident, decisive, the kind of person who could probably tell if you were faking it in a second.

Martin waves and gestures to me. “This is Nichole, our newest designer. She’s just starting out, but she’s got a lot of potential.”

I smile, feeling the heat rise to my cheeks. “Hi, it’s nice to meet you.” My voice comes out a little higher than usual.

Though usually, I'm working. BUT. If I didn't? I'd be napping, existing slowly, picking up a donut, drinking copious amounts of coffee and staring at my ceiling, thinking about how I should probably be reading to keep my brain all wrinkly and tight but then the moment passes, and I let my brain get all smooth and jelly like. 

Mondays, well, buddy, let me tell ya. It feels so optimistic. It's the button we press to get back into our productive groove. Maybe we're cleaning some walls, maybe we're working. Shaking off the week before, ready to start again, do something different so that maybe the week won't drag like it did the last one. 

I'm filled with a surprising amount of optimism and dreams for someone who typically comes off as direct and a bit intimidating. As the day goes, the dread succumbs me and then I'm ready for bed, so we must be as optimistic as we can be in the mornings, when it's all fresh and dewy outside. Where the sun beams through my blinds and my dog is all stretchy and blinky by my feet, full of forgiveness of all the times I probably kicked her in my sleep. 

I'm not only passionate and excited about what ""could be"" in the mornings, but I'm also pretty food passionate, brain tickle chaser (6 days a week, she's TIGHT and SO wrinkly), and pretty into listening to some sad indie song while I stare longingly out the bus window like I'm in a movie. Counting how many phones I see in drivers laps or hands, wondering if that man sitting on the curb is existing or lives there, or wondering if those high schoolers in their big baggy hoodies in this fucking heat are doing okay. 

What I'm looking for: conversations that last until they don't, I'm open to feelings and romance, too. Just come in my inbox with transparency so that I can have the right set of wit about me when it comes to you. 

My metaphorical guts are out here on the table, on some thrifted platter, hoping someone sees them and likes them enough to slap theirs out too. ",2,1753756978.0,r4r,1,0.75,False
