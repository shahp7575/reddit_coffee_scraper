It took me about 40 minutes of price matching and hovering around the reduced for quick sale meat section, but we got there.

The 10lb bag of potatoes was the MVP of this run ($4.22 on sale). I’m planning on doing baked potatoes, mash, and maybe some home fries to bulk out every single meal. I also managed to snag a Enjoy Tonight 50% off sticker on some ground beef, which is basically like winning the lottery in this economy.

The Haul Breakdown:

* 10lb Potatoes: $4.22
* Ground Beef (50% off): $7.50
* Large Dozen Eggs: $4.76
* 2L Milk: $5.38
* Frozen Mixed Veggies (750g): $3.99
* Loaf of Bread: $3.53
* Bananas (2lbs): $2.46 (roughly)
* Total: $31.84

 I’m basically going to be making a massive shepherd’s pie (using the beef, half the potatoes, and the frozen veggies) which should last 3-4 nights. The rest of the week is going to be eggs on toast and jacket potatoes.

I’d really appreciate some outside perspective.

I (23F) met a guy (30M) at a wedding about a month ago. There was mutual attraction and we hooked up once. After that, we stayed in touch consistently for about a month, texting almost daily and having a couple of phone calls. Conversations were easy, reciprocal, and warm. He shared playlists, sent updates from his day, and remembered details about me. Nothing intense or love-bomby.
Our families have been aware that we have been talking.

He lives abroad and returned briefly before moving back in January. He planned a trip to my city shortly before his return on my suggestion. Just before he came to my city, communication actually felt better.

When he arrived, we met once at a café with his friends. The meeting went well. There was no awkwardness, conversation flowed, his friends were friendly, and he was attentive remembered tiny details, sweet. He accompanied me in my cab to drop me home afterward. Nothing physical happened beyond that, not even touching of hands.

What confused me:
• He initially invited me to join him and his friends for a trek, then later told me not to come.
• The next day, which was his last full day before flying out, he said it would be difficult to meet due to plans with friends, cafés, and an early flight.
(he had implied we would meet on this day during our first meeting)
• He communicated politely and clearly when asked, but ultimately said it would be difficult meeting.
• He never acted cold or rude, just unavailable.

What makes it confusing:
• He had earlier suggested meeting again, even later in his city for lunch or coffee.
• He is leaving the country in about ten days, so I expected either clearer effort or clearer disengagement.
• He hasn’t ghosted me, but he also hasn’t initiated plans again.
• He is not very expressive and doesn’t double text or chase.

I never expressed strong feelings or pressure. Everything stayed casual from my side. Now I’m unsure whether this is someone liking me but avoiding escalation before leaving, someone compartmentalizing and keeping things light, or quiet disengagement after meeting or him being an avoidant.

I’m considering stepping back to give space because the ambiguity is hard for me.

Questions:
	1.	Does this sound like normal behavior for someone not wanting to escalate before leaving, or more like losing interest?
	2.	Is it reasonable that being declined twice feels like rejection even if communication stayed polite?
	3.	Is it better to step back silently or send a brief, respectful closure message?
	4.	Am I overinterpreting because I’m more emotionally invested?

Also- I told him that it was okay and it was nice meeting him and to have a safe flight.
he said- yeah, it was nice meeting you :) and thanks. 
I didn’t reply after that.

None of his texts have suggested any pulling back, honestly. And my anxious side took over asking to meet again and again. Before he came, i was of the mindset that we would meet once and that would be all. Maybe i created over expectations.

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

I’m just after a bit of insight into a text message from my ex and your thoughts on it.

My ex ‘41 F’ and me ‘35M’ broke up 5 years ago. We had been together for 4 years, had a good relationship but found we had to work on ourselves a bit and called a halt to it but I’d say we’ve stayed friendly, though we never meet for coffee or anything like that. We still message on each others birthdays to wish each other well and generally wish each other well at Christmas. Occasionally she’ll message at random to say hi if she’s been speaking to my sister or something as they were friends at school.

I’m not sure what her relationship status is these days and I would never ask but it crossed my mind to message her last night and say happy Christmas, but I didn’t get around to it. Anyway, I woke this morning and she’d messaged me a gif of a film scene from Love actually. It’s a film we’d have watched around Xmas when together. There was no message with it and it was at 7.30am.

I messaged back and said happy Xmas and we had a little back and forth. She asked where I’d be for Xmas and wished me a good time etc.

I’m wondering if maybe she has feelings at the back of her mind and was looking to open a convo or is it just her sending a joke she thinks I’ll find funny etc? I just felt sending something fairly nostalgic that early in the day seemed a little odd.

I’m not sure we could ever go back as it’s been so long now but I’m just curious as I’ll always love her on some level.

1pw0s5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EmergencyApricot1067/comments/1pw0s5g/what_the_dollartoeuro_rate_means_for_americans_in/,What the Dollar-to-Euro Rate Means for Americans in Italy,"# The Dollar Is Losing Ground—So What Now?

Lately, the U.S. dollar hasn’t exactly been pulling its weight against the euro. What not long ago felt like a favorable exchange rate has started to tilt the other way, and if you live in Italy—or are planning to—it’s probably noticeable. Groceries cost a bit more, rent stings a little extra, even that casual glass of wine in the piazza isn’t as cheap as it used to be.

This isn’t just a random fluctuation. A lot is happening under the hood: U.S. interest rates may be headed down, Europe has been more resilient than expected, and global markets are constantly reshuffling. If you earn in dollars but spend in euros, it’s worth understanding what’s going on—if only to stay sane when you’re paying for a croissant.



# What Might Come Next (and Why It Matters)

**Short term (6–12 months)**  
If the Federal Reserve begins cutting interest rates, the dollar could weaken further. That said, major global instability could still give the dollar a temporary boost—during turbulent times, investors often retreat to “safe” currencies.

**Medium term (1–3 years)**  
The euro may continue to strengthen, especially if Europe remains relatively stable while U.S. debt keeps growing. For anyone planning expenses in euros over the long run, this could mean your dollars won’t go as far.

**Long term (3–10 years)**  
There’s a gradual global shift away from relying so heavily on the U.S. dollar. If Europe deepens economic cooperation, the euro could gain even more influence. For people living abroad, that trend can quietly reshape everyday costs—from rent to coffee—so it’s not something to ignore.



# What Really Moves the Exchange Rate

If you want a clearer picture of what drives these changes, here are the main forces at play:

* **Interest rates** Higher U.S. rates tend to strengthen the dollar; lower rates usually weaken it.
* **Inflation and economic health** If inflation cools in the U.S. while Europe struggles, the dollar looks more attractive. But if Europe holds steady and the U.S. falters, the euro can pull ahead.
* **Energy prices** Europe relies heavily on imported energy. When prices rise, the euro often weakens—making dollars go a bit further.
* **Global uncertainty** Periods of instability often push investors toward the dollar, at least in the short run.



# Practical Moves That Can Help

You don’t need to outsmart the market, but a few simple strategies can make life easier:

* **Avoid transferring everything at once** Spread transfers over time so you’re not locked into a bad rate.
* **Use flexible financial tools** Multi-currency accounts like Wise or Revolut let you hold both dollars and euros and convert when the timing feels right.
* **Let technology help** Many apps allow you to set exchange-rate alerts and notify you when your target rate is reached.
* **Leave some breathing room** Exchange rates fluctuate. A small buffer in your budget can soften the impact of short-term swings.



# Perspective Still Matters

Yes, the exchange rate isn’t as favorable as it was a few months ago. But if you’re living in Italy—or moving here—it’s probably not just for cheaper cappuccinos.

You came for the lifestyle, the pace, the beauty, the people. And none of that depends on how strong the dollar happens to be this week.

Stay informed, make thoughtful choices, and then get on with enjoying your life.

After all, that’s the whole point.",1,1766743163.0,u_EmergencyApricot1067,0,1.0,False

Long time advice giver on here and I think this is finally the time where I'm going to come to you all with my own issue. The experience from this I've gotten is a big reason I like to be on here to try to help others and I'd like to think I do an okay job at it
I'm going to try to summarize this because I'm back in my hometown at my mom's house for Christmas and I'd really rather be asleep but I have to get this out because it has been eating at me all week.
I've tried posting this before but between it being hard to get through coherently and many subs rejecting the post for various reasons on an alt account, I'm caving and using my main and just going to deal with it later. Sorry for formatting and all since this will be from mobile.

Anyway, when I was 7 my mom sort of became friends with a man she met through signing me up for karate classes. I'll call him step dad even though they've never been legally married. My dad has tried to but never been super involved in my life past a certain age because he became severely disabled through multiple sclerosis.

My mom would eventually start going on coffee dates with step dad and wouldn't tell me who this guy she was seeing was, understandable since I was really young but this did a huge number on my trust and I knew who step dad was in person from karate class.

Eventually I stopped going to karate class and I had to beg my mom to tell me who this guy we called ""mystery man"" was and it just became a really weird time in my childhood. We started going on fishing trips because step dad was very outdoorsy. Eventually learned who step dad was after having suspicions. He started secretly taking my mom and I on more trips and I did sort of respect him for it and he would sometimes be motivational but also really rude at times.

Over the years my mom started just going out of town with step dad once or so a year while my dad was alive, but in disabled care homes. Important context: we would regular visit my dad and my mom absolutely devoted more time to him, especially with how much care he required. 

For several years, step dad would come over and sped hours at a time at our house. Mom would try to tell me that a lot of kids go through things like this and I would voice my frustration with a man just coming over and taking our food and bothering my friends and I, making us really uncomfortable. I was 10 at the time so I sort of just tried to convince myself mom was right and knew what she was doing.

Step dad would also be really disrespectful around this time and would do bizarre things like use a tissue or paper towel and hand it to me as a ""joke"".

Eventually the inevitable happened and my dad died, when I was 13, due to medical complications. Heavy grieving period, of course, for both mom and I, but it's largely separate from this story. After several months step dad started spending a lot of time at our house again and we'd still occasionally do things like trips all together but I'd press to not go more often because he was really rude and would show up and bother me super early in the morning when I had to wake up later for school. This was because he worked nights and our house was on his way to work, making it even more convenient for him to stop by.

This whole thing became a joke of sorts among my friends and I because step dad would just hang around and try (poorly) to be relatable. Severely of my friends, male and female, would occasionally tell me he really creeper them out at times.

Next part might be nsfw or a trigger but I'm just going to tell it as is. For the timeline, I was 16 at the time
Eventually, the dam broke and I have a very vivid memory of pressing my ear to my moms locked door and very clearly heard them having sex. I had a but of a panic attack and just waited wondering what to do. An hour or so later, step dad left promptly after leaving bedroom, because he was flying back to his home state the next day. I confronted my mom and she pretty quickly admitted to having an affair.

This was extremely enraging to me because step dad has been married to another woman for over 20 years and has two college aged dughters who were living at his home with his wife and him at the time.

I vaguely remember just screaming at my mom and crying the whole night and not being able to believe what was happening. This was easily the worst time of my life to date and I stopped eating for several days. I continued going to school during this time but it added additional stress onto my life that did not help. I'd regularly have to take breaks during the day to calm down.

I didn't talk to my mom for the next couple months unless it was to argue with her. The extent of responsibility she took for this situation  was saying that I might understand when I was older and that she was ""trying to protect"" me from ""someone else coming into the family""

I repeatedly explained to her that that made no sense because step dad regularly would spend hours at our house harassing me. I never received any real apology and my mom essentially tried to act like nothing happened. This struck a nerve with me because she regularly said my grandma would deal with problems by pretending not talking about them meant they never happened, which is very hypocritical in my eyes.

Over the next several years, step dad would still come over very often, albeit less. Mom seemed to take my opinion on the matter more seriously and claims that she stopped having sex with step dad. She would occasionally still go have coffee or go on day trips with step dad, however. 

The last few years, leading up to now, are more difficult to describe but essentially, mom has tried to make it appear to me that she agrees with me that step-dad is dishonest and she wants him to stay away.

Contrary to this, instead of blocking his number permanently, getting a restraining order, slamming the door in his face, etc. She has only just gotten in small arguments with him and I noticed he came over to the house less.

Eventually, my relationship with mom did heal, and as furious as I am at myself, I sort of rolled over and let her do what she wanted, since I was approaching 18. Step dad continued to disrespect me and I resisted the urge to tell him to leave the house, although after finally pressing my mom to sit him down at the table with the three of us so I could explain my ultimatum that of he did not get a divorce, I would have nothing to do with him or my mom and that I couldn't trust anyone's word at this point, this went no where. Mom was more concerned with making dinner, and step dad lashed out and defended himself before choosing to stay despite how mad I was.

And finally we're mostly done. There's really no clear ending to this but I eventually moved out and live several states away. I still love my mom but these are emotional scars that will not heal. I'm in my early 20s now and have learned some things about this whole multi decade issue over time. No good place to fit them into the story so heres some context""

1. He'd regularly borrow money from us and not pay it back. This allegedly happened right when we were extremely poor and struggling due to my real dad's medical issues.
2. His wife and him don't get along at all, and she is also likely cheating on him, and they have been discussing divorce for years. To my knowledge, they're still married and living together with no plans of it changing.
3. I remember him regularly making excuses that he'd get a divorce when their house was done veing renovated (never figured out why they'd do that when they allegedly were getting a divorce) or that his daughters were about to graduate college  and then he'd file he also lied about filing once.
4. He still occasionally shows up to the house, despite my aunt having moved in since I no longer live there, to help pay mom's mortgage and be a roommate, paying rent, essentially.
5. Mom claims affair began about 6 months after my dad died. The short time span it took her to move on does not help my mental fortitude but ut was clear she loved my dad. As I'm sure you are reading this, I'm highly suspicious that affair was happening before he died too, especially given my mom's rough circumstances as a single mother. 
6. Step dad had a separate family incident a couple years ago, where he learned his dad (died when he was in his 20s, in the 1980s) wasn't his bio dad and his bio dad was, completely serious here, a super rich Canadian man who was in his 90s and also had several very successful, legitimate kids. Step dad's mom had been covering up that she knew for 50 years and she had an affair. This is insanely ironic in my mind and I'd hoped it would drastically change the situstion for my mom but sadly, it did not. Still can hardly believe that was real but I swear it is.

So, that's basically the word vomit version of this. I've tried mentioning this to therapists over the years but it doesn't seem to go anywhere and I've been out of therapy for a whole now because of the expense.
Mom has never gone to therapy, that I'm aware, and has never  admitted that she was emotionally dependent on step dad or anything, despite regularly complaining about him but doing nothing to address my issues with it.

I feel partly responsible because I've also tried to avoid being confrontational since the first incident where I confronted mom. I still regularly come home for holidays and this all started because step dad arrived unannounced (which he has done before many times) during the day and invited  himself to lounge around. He in fact did buy me and of course bought mom a christmas gift. Mine was a cheap massage gun from Walmart but that's irrelevant.

I have struggled for years, including now, to emotionally reconcile all of this. Mom has always changed the subject or gotten irritated when I try to discuss it and I'm sure there's many other tidbits I could give but that's the short version of this now 16 or 17 year story.

I'm very sorry for the length but i just don't know what to do about this and I'm afraid to try to call my mom and see if she'll finally listen or fess up after all these years. I both do and dont want to tell her how ive had anger fits where i cant stop thinking over this and will voice to myself what i wish id said to her and step dad everytime they put me down over the years. Of course, usually very cruel and brutally honest words.

 I'm currently still home and this whole thing has made for a christmas where I've had to routinely bite my tongue and take bathroom breaks to let it out. Friends who I've missed have been visiting and making the tension easier and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't having a great time either my mom again when step dad is not here and out of my mind.

It's extremely conflicting and now that christmas day itself has passed here, I've been really questioning if step dad and moms dishonesty might be the reason I've had so many mental health problems over the years. I still don't fully trust my mom and have trust issues from her not doing what she said she would and changing the subject when I try to discuss this.

Since things have really died down, and it's turned to him showing up on occasion to chat and drop off gifts or whatever, I'm not sure if I'm the bad guy now and I just need to see a therapist about letting this go, if I might be misrepresenting this to myself and everybody, etc.

OR if I'm jsut going to keep having anxiety and anger fits alone in my apartment at night until I tell my mom just how much she let me down back then and try to make her see. As much as I would love to have her just apologize and admit she was wrong for lying for so long, I think that's a fantasy and I shouldn't hold my breath.

I'm going to wrap this up before I keep rambling, as this topic makes me get stuck in a mental loop and I keep going over the same things on repeat and make myself feel worse.

Sorry for the extreme length but it'd mean the world to me if anyone would read this through, and offer their experience with a similar situation or even just some advice on how to handle it going forward. I'm sure typos and bad formatting will be plentiful since I had to type this without a keyboard. But thank you all, and I hope the closing holiday season treats you all very well. I know you all deserve it.

TL;DR: Mom lied to me about an affair (with a married man who refuses to this day to get divorced) that she'd been having for 2 years straight. This man still comes over and acts as my half ass, extremely disrespectful stepdad. I have no idea how to approach this situation several years after the affair has come out.",1,1766742952.0,internetparents,1,1.0,False

# Inside a covert IDF intelligence cell tasked with identifying and eliminating every attacker from Oct. 7, officers reveal for the first time how kidnappers were tracked, killers exposed by phone calls and a target struck at the most unexpected moment

The video quickly became, on that same Black Saturday, one of the defining symbols of the horrors of October 7. [Avinatan Or and Noa Argamani](https://www.ynetnews.com/magazine/article/rjmngeebr) were seen terrified at the moment they were separated; Argamani, on a motorcycle, reaching out toward Or, who was being marched away, bruised, surrounded by gunmen intoxicated with success. One of them, seen in the footage pushing Or and pulling him away from his loved one, would soon be identified as Ahmed Shaer.

He did not know it in real time, but Shaer and his fellow abductors became the target of a small unit within Military Intelligence, which was given one of the most complex missions of the war: to locate all the abductors, murderers, rapists, looters and arsonists who crossed into Israel on October 7 and neutralize them. They operate in absolute secrecy from a small room at Southern Command, under the name NILI, an acronym taken from the biblical verse “The Eternal One of Israel will not lie,” perhaps a hint that none of these terrorists would be forgotten. Not even Shaer.

The problem was that he seemed to know it and tried to stay under the radar. “He was extremely cautious,” said Capt. A., commander of NILI, whose members are speaking for the first time in an exclusive interview with 7 Days, Yedioth Ahronoth’s weekend magazine. “Shaer almost never left the house or spoke with people. For a long time we did not even know where his home was. He left no trace.”

But about a year ago, that changed. Capt. A. received the long-awaited call indicating Shaer’s estimated location and began feeding intelligence into a file that would make it possible to build a case for his neutralization, or in intelligence parlance, his “incrimination.” Working alongside him was Sgt. S., an intelligence analyst trained to track down terrorists and operatives in hiding.

“The work was relatively long,” S. recalled, “both in incriminating him and tying him to the event, and in narrowing down and locating his whereabouts. It was a lengthy process that took about 10 months.”

[Ad](https://popup.taboola.com/en) 

Eventually, Capt. A. and Sgt. S. focused on several buildings in Gaza, one of which, according to their research, was where Shaer was hiding. “We debated between them,” Capt. A. said. “In the end, S. managed to link him to one specific building and then to a room where we knew he slept. We prepared in the middle of the night to catch him while he was asleep.”

The operation was set for March 25 of this year. Toward evening, Capt. A. and Sgt. S. arrived at the strike cell, a room serving as a command center where representatives from the Air Force, intelligence and operations staff are physically present or dial in by phone.

“Everyone arrives,” Capt. A. recalled. “We drank coffee, because we knew how the night would begin but not how it would end. You are constantly imagining how the target you worked on for so many months will no longer exist by morning. I finish my coffee, put on my headset and everyone joins me on a conference call. S. and I are on, along with Southern Command intelligence, the task force commander who coordinates the fire, and on the line as well are the Shin Bet internal security service and the Air Force.

“This is work done quietly and with extreme professionalism. There is no shouting in the room. S. and I have two minutes on the clock to give them the entire intelligence picture. We have been on him for 10 months, but at that moment you have to deliver the most focused, precise and rapid information possible, information that can assist the strike: what the house looks like, what the walls are made of, when the target goes to sleep. At that moment, my role as the intelligence officer is to say whether the intelligence picture has changed. I have to verify that the target is still there.”

And then?  
“At a certain point I said, ‘Incriminated.’ The task force commander declared, ‘Authorized,’ and the Air Force representative said over the radio, ‘Released.’ Then there is half a minute of silence, with everyone tense, waiting to see whether we hit the target. It is an emotional, nerve-racking moment, when months of work, including images, videos and everything we heard about Avinatan and Noa, all converge into those 30 seconds of silence, as everything you know about Avinatan and Noa runs through your mind.

“Then you see an explosion, and the missile goes through the window that S. managed to tie to him. There are a few seconds of smoke, and we see people running out of the building. These are super-critical moments in the context of such a boutique strike: We do not know who the people fleeing are, and from there, serious work begins to understand whether we succeeded or not.”

“That night,” Sgt. S. said, “I was only hoping to find out that he was dead. It is tension like nothing else in the world. My baby, the thing I worked on more than anything, was distilled into one very significant half-minute. When they finally said ‘Alpha’” — the radio code name indicating the missile had hit — “I was happy that at least the operational part had been carried out successfully.”

But you did not know whether your target had been neutralized.  
“I can say that it really confused us that so many people fled the building,” Sgt. S. said. “For a full week I was grinding my teeth, searching for the indication that he was dead. On Telegram and in all kinds of other places. So many people, in every field, were running every possible check.”

“No matter how long we have been awake,” Capt. A. said, “after a strike like that there is no chance of falling asleep. We are sitting in bed with the phone, searching for every scrap of information. There are, for example, Gaza journalists who publish lists of the dead. Every message in Arabic gets run through Google Translate, and you struggle to fall asleep.”

[Kidnapping of Noa Argamani and Avinatan Or](https://preview.redd.it/02v1r9absi9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=24e00884f44fcf60703d275b85b50093be557188)

So how did you ultimately understand that you had succeeded, that Shaer had been neutralized?

  
Sgt. S.: “After a week we received a positive indication that he had been killed. Quite simply, people began posting eulogies for him. He was apparently wounded and fought for his life, which is why we received the confirmation later. At the time this happened, Noa was already back in Israel and Avinatan was still in captivity, so there was sensitivity around publication.

""It was emotional and a kind of closure, because I was personally connected to their story. Already on the night the bomb was dropped, I imagined the announcement that would come out and their sigh of relief. It was delayed, but it happened. There was nothing more moving for me than seeing that they came home and were reunited. For me, that is closure: seeing that he returned and learned that most of the people who abducted him are no longer here.”

It began about a month and a half after the war broke out. Capt. A. was summoned to the office of his commander, the head of the targets branch in Southern Command intelligence, the unit responsible for the command’s target bank. The meeting took place against the backdrop of intelligence received from the Shin Bet concerning Col. Asaf Hamami, commander of the Southern Brigade in the Gaza Division, the most senior military officer killed on October 7 and abducted into Gaza.

“They told me, ‘We want you to set up a team that will deal with everything connected to the hostage cases, starting from one test case, Hamami,’” Capt. A. said. “At the Shin Bet, they worked hard and surfaced all kinds of intelligence about the abduction, but in the end they do not have a strike capability. They needed someone from the military to be the operational tip of the spear.

“Based on the information we received, we began tracking the targets connected to the abduction. Along the way we discovered that a friend of the person we were focusing on had also crossed into Israel on October 7. We said, ‘Let’s do something about him as well.’ Slowly, more targets emerged, and as hostages returned” — bringing additional intelligence — “the circle expanded with more names of people who abducted, murdered or guarded captives alive."" The list eventually included even those who pulled captives from vehicles and took part in the release ceremonies, he said, “and in general, anyone who did bad things to them.”

Very quickly, the number of targets compiled by NILI reached about 6,000 terrorists, but today the figure is higher and includes everyone who entered Israeli territory on October 7, as well as additional targets, such as the terrorists who held hostages in captivity. Still, priority is given to those among them who carried out murders and abductions.

“We prioritize targets that represent closure for the families, because that is our obligation to the public,” Capt. A. said. “If there is a specific terrorist linked to a murder case, he is ranked higher for us than someone I can say only that he crossed into Israel.”

The assessment is that more than 1,000 of the October 7 infiltrators have already been killed. Among them: the terrorist from Mefalsim who boasted in a phone call to his father that he had murdered 10 Israelis; the “journalist” who reported on the assault from the lawn of Kibbutz Be’eri; the abductors of Eitan Mor; the abductors of Noa Argamani and Avinatan Or; the terrorist who breached the border fence with a bulldozer in the widely circulated footage; and many others.

NILI builds a detailed file for each of these terrorists: who he is, what he did, what is known about his life, his associates, his daily routine, where he lives or hides and countless other details. The ultimate goal is that when an operational opportunity arises, that target will be neutralized.

One of those targets was Wael Matria, a platoon commander who infiltrated the Nahal Oz base on October 7 and, together with another platoon commander, was involved in the abduction of surveillance soldiers Karina Ariev and Liri Albag. Capt. A. assigned the task to his most senior investigator, Sgt. G.

At the time, he recalled, G. did not say a word about the fact that she knew Albag from school. Her heightened motivation to track down Wael seemed to him natural and routine. “She was obsessive and searched for him relentlessly,” A. said.

[The terrorist Wael Matria](https://preview.redd.it/v4ud2tgesi9g1.png?width=1005&format=png&auto=webp&s=c42fd9336865cf67c1d42c498fd856b89637c0ea)

What did the pursuit look like?  
Maj. A.: “Matria and his accomplice were two targets we worked on intensively together with the Shin Bet. We tried to strike them many times, and each time something happened and it did not go through. A kind of bad luck. I remember that every phone call would send us jumping, and we would say, ‘This time it’s happening.’

“One day I came in for what was supposed to be another routine day at the office, and that night the first ceasefire was due to begin, which only heightened the drama. We understood that we were about to enter a different phase and did not know when the next opportunity to neutralize that terrorist would come.

“In the evening, I get a call from the Shin Bet: ‘We think our target is on such-and-such a street.’ I sprint to the strike cell, ask that surveillance be positioned on the street, and start scanning. These are extremely stressful moments. That’s why it’s critical to be laser-focused, to connect the intelligence to us in real time and not lose it. It means pulling in people you don’t know, who suddenly become your strike team, and everything goes from zero to 100, because in two minutes a lot can happen.”

And then what?  
“We begin scanning and trying to locate the target at the spot the Shin Bet pointed to, until we understand that we are locked on. Then the intelligence officer says, ‘Incriminated,’ and the task force commander says, ‘Authorized.’ In this case, the target was walking down the street, and it was 30 tense seconds, when in the final five seconds the target decided to stop at an intersection — and that is where he was neutralized, together with his accomplice. It was an operational opportunity once we realized the two of them were together.”

How many targets like this does each investigator handle at the same time?  
“Each one is responsible for about 20 targets simultaneously. Any piece of information connected to them comes to the investigator, and she processes it, sometimes on a daily basis. When they ‘break down’ a target, all kinds of details surface: who he wakes up with in the morning, where he goes, where he works, where he sleeps, his daily routine. Numbers, photos, videos, lists — these are not things that are handed to us on a silver platter. Every video that comes out on Telegram or elsewhere, we try to cross-check in our systems.

“Another task of the cell is to determine who is alive, who is dead, who is detained, who infiltrated Israel. In my view, that is a task that will accompany us for years to come, because we are constantly receiving new information about people who entered the country and we did not know about at the time.”

The intelligence on the targets flows to NILI from a wide range of sources: debriefings of hostages who have returned to Israel; interrogations of terrorists by the Shin Bet and Unit 504, the IDF’s human intelligence unit; intercepts from Unit 8200, the military’s signals intelligence arm; documents and computers seized in Gaza by Amshat, the unit responsible for collecting intelligence materials and technical spoils; and, of course, open-source intelligence and videos the terrorists themselves recorded.

The investigators can request specific information from any of these units — for example, asking a Unit 504 interrogator to question a particular terrorist about a friend of his who is a NILI target.

How does this actually work? Give an example.  
Sgt. G.: “For example, I scroll on TikTok and download a video, say, of an attack on one of the kibbutzim. You see people’s faces there. At that stage they are still anonymous to me, so I upload the footage into facial recognition software, similar to biometric systems. If a name comes up, I cross-check it against a lot of other information. It may be that the operative is already on certain lists, and that provides additional corroboration” — meaning cross-verified intelligence indicating it is the same person and that he did in fact carry out what is attributed to him.

So you figured out his name and what he did. What comes next?  
“We try to understand who the person is: where he lives, what car he drives, where he works, what he likes to buy at the market, at what hours he goes there. It really gets down to the smallest details — whether he talks to his wife, how he talks to his wife, whether he has another wife. By the way, almost all of them do, and their wives probably know and stay silent; it seems to be more accepted there. Sometimes we focus on the people around him — catching him through those who surround him, through family, through a family friend, children.”

Sgt. S.: “We truly know the targets from A to Z. We can say what they like to do, what they like to eat, at the most tactical, granular levels. There are some who wander around all day, strolling freely through the streets of Gaza and behaving as if they did nothing. Others continue to deal with military activity and plan attacks against the forces.”

This stage — building the case and gathering the material for a terrorist’s file — can take weeks, months, sometimes even years. “There was a target I started working on in November 2024 and only this month managed to incriminate him, and there are targets I can incriminate within two days,” Sgt. G. said. “It varies from operative to operative and depends on how cautious he is, on his counterintelligence awareness. Over time I noticed that many of the October 7 videos began disappearing from Telegram. They understood the mistake they made in publishing those videos in the first place, and that also makes things harder.”

So what do you do?  
“You keep investigating. It’s something that occupies you even outside work hours. You go back to sleep and think of more ways to find the person — when he goes to pray, where. In the end, it’s the most intimate familiarity there is. You live him 24/7, really connected to him, especially given that before this you did not even know who he was. We know these operatives better than they know themselves.”

But if he goes to the mosque every morning, isn’t every morning a good time to strike?  
“In principle, yes,” Maj. A. said, “but we have to be 100 percent certain. We are not operating on routine activity, as in, if he’s there every morning then let’s strike. I need to know, with a very high level of confidence, that my operative is at the location at the moment I say ‘incriminated.’

“At the end of the day, these people who infiltrated Israel on October 7 and then returned to their routines spend some of their time engaged in terrorism and continuing to advance attack plans. Some of the time they go to the supermarket or go to a school and hide there. If I can prove that everyone around them is an operative, there is no problem — I can strike. But if I have incriminated a mosque, and I know there are 20 people inside, and I cannot say with absolute certainty that they are terrorists, then we wait for him to leave the mosque.”

“We try to incriminate our operatives at their ‘anchors’” — basic locations where the terrorists routinely stay — “places we know they use,” said Sgt. Y., an intelligence analyst in the unit. “For example, where they sleep. I know he will be there all night, that he will not leave for even a minute. And if we know to say that he is about to leave, then we say that.”

[\(Photo: Alex Kolomoisky\)](https://preview.redd.it/vljih87hsi9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=efd1949e2f221bb7014a9815ca242ae533eb5691)

“It’s like a puzzle, where everyone assembles their own piece,” Sgt. S. said. “HUMINT” — human intelligence — “SIGINT” — signals intelligence, mainly communications — “and VISINT” — visual intelligence, such as aerial imagery and drone footage. It all comes together into one complete operation.”

To complete the puzzle, analysts from the decoding cell come into the picture. That team, also part of the targets branch, works in close coordination with NILI. They are the ones who ultimately pinpoint the terrorist’s location.

“I can ask Military Intelligence for a ‘tool’” — usually a drone — “and follow the operative,” Capt. A. said. “Every place he enters, I ‘stab’ a point on a virtual screen” — marking the location. “Slowly, I start assembling a kind of puzzle. Then I go to the Shin Bet and say, ‘I’d appreciate it if you activate one of your investigators from Gaza who knows the area and understands it. Tell me what the points I marked are.’ He’ll tell me, ‘That’s a supermarket,’ ‘That’s a garage.’

“Later I notice that these points keep repeating themselves, and I begin to understand the hours and daily routine of the operative.”

At that point, Sgt. 1st Class B., from the decoding branch, enters the picture. “For example, I tell him,” Capt. A. said, “‘I saw my target enter a building and disappear.’ I don’t know what happens inside. B. knows how to look at a building and see that, for instance, there is a narrow shaft running across several floors — probably a stairwell — so the terrorist is certainly not sleeping there.

“Then, for example, a report comes in that he spoke with a friend and told him, ‘I’m by a window, freezing.’ From that I know there is a window. I go back to B. and ask, ‘Where are there windows in this building?’ He answers and narrows it down. Then, say, I hear that the room has white bars, and B. tells me that only three of all the rooms with bars have white bars. And that’s how we narrow it down all the way, until we have his precise location.”

Quite a puzzle. And what if there is no such information?  
“Sometimes I have an intelligence item that isn’t geographic,” Capt. A. said. “For example, a terrorist’s home is bombed, and we understand he wants to move elsewhere. In that case, B. has nothing to tell me — he doesn’t predict the future and doesn’t know where the operative will go. Here I need a Military Intelligence body that can tell me where people usually relocate in situations like that.”

That was the case, for example, with Mahmoud Afana. On October 7, Afana was one of the terrorists who infiltrated Kibbutz Mefalsim, and his chilling boastful phone call to his father became infamous.

“I’m inside Mefalsim. Dad, I killed 10!” he said proudly. “Their blood is on my hands. I’m talking to you from a Jewish woman’s phone. I killed her and her husband.” His excited parents congratulated him on the “achievement.”

“This is a person we worked very hard to locate together with many different bodies,” Capt. A. said. “From someone who boasted and became a hero, he turned into a mouse in a hole, fleeing from place to place. The moment his call was published on October 8, he understood he was wanted.

“Then he began implementing all kinds of counterintelligence procedures: He doesn’t move around crowded places, doesn’t use any technological means whatsoever. He lives alone, stays alone, tries to manage on his own. He surrounds himself with no one and trusts no one.”

So how do you reach a terrorist like that?  
“The secret to neutralizing a person like this is patience and a very strong belief in the process,” Capt. A. said. “There is a lot of frustration in trying to find someone like that, because by the time you finally connect to the smallest clue, he is already gone — and that happens a lot. We searched for him for two years. The change in the operational reality in the Strip, with maneuvering taking place in different areas each time, caused many operatives to move around. And when that happens, I know how to latch onto it.”

In early September of this year, just under two years after his phone call from Mefalsim to his parents, Afana was neutralized.

One Saturday last summer, all NILI soldiers, a single-digit number — who were home for the weekend were called back in, and those who were on duty at the base were instructed to drop whatever missions they were working on.

“They told us, ‘Leave everything you’re doing. This is what we’re dealing with now,’” Sgt. G. said. “It was at such a level that they couldn’t even wait until Sunday, when everyone would be back from home, to start working on it.”

The target was connected to one of the hostages who had been returned. “Each one of us,” G. said, “incriminated someone connected to that hostage — whether it was an abductor, someone who held him, or someone who moved him from place to place.”

And what suddenly happened that Saturday?  
“After we had incriminated the target, an intelligence indication came in that the person was located. We saw him from an aerial platform tracking him, moving around in a very restless way in an area with many tents, a place with a great many people. And we waited for the right moment to pull the trigger.”

What was the right moment?  
“When he simply separated from a very large group of people he had been with and went to a restroom. That’s when we understood he was alone — and that’s where we struck him. We waited about an hour over the target, when we knew we could say he was there, in order to reach the right time and the right place, when he was not moving, when he was static, with a minimum number of people around him.”

Sgt. S.: “It really creates an extraordinary sense of closure for the hostage and his family. It’s the small seal the army and the state can give a person, to say: ‘We see you,’ ‘We care about you,’ ‘We are committed to telling your story and making sure the account is settled.’”

Not all targeted killings are publicized when they occur, and in cases involving living hostages, members of NILI sometimes began working on the target only after the hostage returned. That was the case with Eitan Mor. The man who abducted him was neutralized, but publication of the strike was permitted only after Mor returned to Israel in the most recent deal.

“After the strike was made public,” Sgt. G. recalled, “Eitan posted a story with a photo of the abductor and a cynical line about fate. I felt he was sending us a message of thanks. Knowing that I gave a sense of relief to someone who went through a nightmare, because we neutralized his abductor — for me, that’s wow.”

“When hostages return, they shed light for us on the meaning of the work,” Sgt. S. said. “You see a hostage in a video, but you can’t really understand what the person experienced in those moments. When a hostage comes back and knows that his captor or abductor is no longer alive, knowing that I was the one who closed that circle for him, even in the smallest way — that is what moves me most.”

“I remember that during the period when I was dealing with the person who abducted Eitan Mor, we visited the Nova site,” Capt. A. said, referring to the site of the music festival massacre. “You walk among the small memorials, you see a picture of Eitan Mor, you see Avinatan Or, and you say, ‘I dealt with the person who abducted him.’ And then another picture, and another. It fills you with an immense sense of meaning and mission.”

One weekend, Capt. A., a Hapoel Tel Aviv soccer fan, allowed himself to go to a match to clear his head. He reached the stands and, one row below him, spotted a familiar face. It was Liam Or, the hostage who returned in the first deal. “We worked very hard in the cell to find two people we could say with certainty abducted and held him, and in the end we struck them as well,” he said. “Time passed, we were already dealing with other things, and one day I come to a game and Liam is sitting one row below me. I see him and know that, well, we neutralized those connected to him.

“At that time, those terrorists had been holding other hostages, and there was a risk in revealing that we had carried out the strike, so it wasn’t something that was published. And I’m sitting near a hostage who, a moment earlier, had been in captivity, and I have this enormous internal dilemma: Does he deserve to know that we neutralized the people who abducted him, or not?

“On the one hand, there is an element of closure, and that’s what I work for, and he deserves to know. On the other hand, who am I to, in the middle of a Hapoel game, drag him back into the trauma of captivity? And I don’t know how he would react to that.”

What did you decide?  
“Not to say anything. Even the smallest risk of dragging him back into something he did not want to relive was too much. Each of us went our own way, even though inside I was bursting. Only months later was it published. The publication, by the way, is our tool for conveying the message to the families, because we do not speak with them directly and do not even know whether they are aware of NILI’s existence.”

“It is always published as ‘the IDF struck’ or ‘the IDF neutralized,’” Sgt. S. said, “and I think that is the right way to do it. In the end, I see myself as the one who built the case, but behind me are many units — in intelligence, the Air Force. Ultimately, it is a huge enterprise.”

Some of the footage the unit’s members are exposed to in their daily work is extremely difficult to watch. Capt. A. said he tried to limit his investigators’ exposure as much as possible. “Things that are hard on the soul, I tried to watch myself,” he said. “To extract names and then let them work on the names. It’s important to say that for every target, we work with corroboration that he infiltrated, murdered, abducted and so on. The terrorists were equipped with GoPro cameras, which were left behind in Israel on the bodies of dead terrorists.

“Y., for example, worked on a particular abductor whose kidnapping videos were very hard to watch. I told her, ‘You work on him — the corroboration is on me.’ The women here are fighters in their own way. There are fighters in the field, and there are fighters sitting in front of a computer, exposed to extremely difficult material on a psychological level. But that is also what makes us understand every day why we do what we do.

“There is nothing more satisfying than neutralizing that abductor and then going for a run at the Tel Aviv Port, seeing the sign calling for the hostage’s return, and saying to myself: ‘I was responsible for making sure something like this will not be done again by people like that.’”

The word “revenge” never comes up in our conversation, nor is it part of their lexicon. When asked, they are clear that this is not what motivates their work. So what does? Closure for the families — and a genuine security necessity.

“In the end,” Sgt. S. explained, “all 6,000 of those targets — from the terrorist who crossed the border in flip-flops to the company commander who led an entire unit — are people with tactical experience and real knowledge of what the country looks like, how it operates, what the terrain is like, where there are gates, how the kibbutzim are built. They can lead the next massacre, and in my view that is the meaning of eliminating them.

“Some of them receive honorary ranks for having infiltrated Israel and murdered people. What we see is that, little by little, they are climbing the command ladders. They are always trying to continue carrying out these activities. It did not end on October 7. On the contrary, it generated motivation for others to do the same, because it showed that it was possible.”

“These people,” Capt. A. said, “also have an insane fan base. They are surrounded by people who idolize them, and if one day Hamas is gone, they might establish the next movement, because they are a symbol of this idea. Beyond that, they have accumulated a great deal of operational experience. They breached a fence, overran a community, know how to read maps, and have experience killing soldiers and murdering children and anyone else who stood in their way. They are dangerous people, and they are the ones who will lead the next infiltration.”

Which targets matter most to you personally?  
Sgt. G.: “An operative who infiltrated the Nahal Oz post, beheaded a soldier and committed atrocities against soldiers.”

Sgt. Y.: “An operative who infiltrated the Gaza Division and carried out murders at the base. In the end, I myself can’t decide what is more ‘valuable’ — killing an operative who murdered, or one who abducted or raped. I work on all of them in parallel. All of them matter. I don’t prioritize someone who murdered or raped over someone else of that kind. I do prioritize them over someone who, say, stole weapons. But ultimately, for me, they are all evil.”

Sgt. S.: “I have my top five — targets that are extremely hard for me to find. There was one evening when I told myself: a ceasefire is about to start, and I have to finish this now, because if not now, I probably never will. I stayed until very late, reached some really good intelligence insights around 10 p.m. at the office, and I succeeded. There are times when I tell myself: this is my moment — to give 200 percent. That was one of those nights.”

Indeed, one of the cell’s current challenges is that now, during the ceasefire — and possibly afterward — there are no strikes. “From a reality in which we could strike the moment we received an indication,” Capt. A. said, “we are now only maintaining targets: knowing how to point to as many operatives as possible, as many locations as possible. The moment there is a violation, or a response on our part, we will take the information from that bank, find who we need and strike.

“We’re not taking our foot off the gas. Now we have quiet and time to try to locate as many of these people as possible. We will reach all of them. Our work never ends. We are temporary here and one day we’ll be discharged, but others will come after us. What will remain is the promise that we will always pursue and always try to find anyone who dared set foot across the border. The mission will be completed.”

What happens after a target is neutralized?  
Sgt. G.: “Each of us has an organized Excel sheet with the targets she’s working on. Everyone chooses what to do once they’ve been neutralized or incriminated, or once you’ve finished working on them. I personally mark those in a green column.”

Sgt. Y.: “I mark them in red.”

Sgt. S.: “And I have a separate table under the heading ‘Neutralized.’”

I'm done.,"Im a new nurse but i have bounced between EMT, CNA, and Psych tech since 2022. Much of the job shifting was trying to find work that didn't conflict with nursing school. I went into this field to help people. But somewhere between health problems from stress, my having a panic attack watching fucking Stranger things, being abused by the people that asked for our help in fixing health problems they caused, being threatened over not feeding addictions, being complained on for caring more about dying children than coffee refills, being falsely accused by lying patients, being attacked as though I'm evil and incompetent for the slightest errors made during circumstances where I was intentionally pushed to the ratio limit then pushed a little further and being punished because its also my responsibility to catch provider errors I had nothing to do with, being demeaned/patronized/bullied by coworkers who'd rather tear down their colleagues than improve the culture and being constantly recorded by patient's that are paranoid and think the people who are standing between them and living and dying like every other animal on the planet are somehow an enemy....somewhere between all of that, I finally had the clearest thought. Today driving home from an ER shift, knowing I'll be chewed tomorrow for an error of someone elses that I didn't catch, I concluded that I'm done. 

I'll keep nursing for now, moving to whatever is most profitable for the level of work needed. But as soon as I find something easier that makes more money I'll do it. ",1,1766742449.0,nursing,1,0.67,False

The community believed there was a “million dollar bug” in it. Tokens would disappear from wallets, balances turned into zeros, and the dev chat was on fire.

Someone joked:  
“If anyone solves this, they deserve a million.”

Challenge accepted.

# Step 1, Reading the inscriptions

Unlike ERC20 on Ethereum, BRC20 lives inside Bitcoin inscriptions. It is more like JSON text stored on chain, not a traditional smart contract.

So I went through the metadata and found something strange.

Balances were tracked like this:

    {
      ""balances"": {
        ""user1"": ""100"",
        ""user2"": ""50""
      }
    }
    

But the code that parsed the balances treated numbers as integers, while the inscriptions stored them as strings.

Uh oh.

# Step 2, Finding the bug

Inside the indexer code, there was something like this:

    def add_balance(current, amount):
        return current + amount
    

But the developer forgot that both values came from JSON as strings.

So the result became string concatenation, not math.

Example:

    current = ""100""
    amount = ""50""
    
    print(add_balance(current, amount))
    

Output:

    10050
    

The system thought the user had “ten thousand fifty” instead of one hundred fifty.

Later, another piece of code tried to “fix” that, saw invalid balance, and reset the wallet to zero.

Million dollar vanish.

# Step 3, The fix

I changed the parser to convert everything to integers before storing.

    def add_balance(current, amount):
        current_int = int(current)
        amount_int = int(amount)
        return current_int + amount_int
    

Now:

    150
    

Balances stopped breaking, the indexer synced correctly, and nobody lost tokens again.

The community cheered. Someone sent me a thank you NFT of a screaming cat. Not exactly a million, but close enough for my ego.

1pw0k5g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pw0k5g,i just had an epiphany. hear me out.,"guys. that coming out scene was WEIRD. we know. **BUT!!** did anyone else pick up on mike’s expression? he looks genuinely distraught… not like the others. he swallows *hard* and makes that signature michael wheeler *“what the actual fuck”* expression. you can also see him swell up, like he might cry but doesn’t. *like something touched a nerve.* he only ever makes that face when he’s confronted with something. he’s also one of the last ones to hug will, which is odd considering he’s **ALWAYS** the first one to embrace will in any scenario. why the hell wouldn’t **COMING OUT AS GAY** be a good reason to immediately embrace your best friend?

i think i know. i’ve rewatched the scene 10 times now. remember that painting that we were **PROMISED** would pay off? the big plot twist we were promised that hasn’t been made apparent?

***i bet you that was the moment it clicked for mike. he knows.***

mike read that letter from el in s4 where el says will is painting for a girl he must like. when mike sees will at the airport, he asks about the painting in wills hand as their first real dialogue, after seeing him holding it and then side hugging him all weird and awkward.

*“whats that?”*

*“just this painting ive been working on, it’s nothing”*

*“oh… cool.”*

he sounded SAD when he said that last line.

when the painting is finally given to him, i KNOW he recognized it. he had to. it was huge, and he never saw will give it to anyone at the airport or the rink… *so why else would he have even brought it?? just to carry it??* i think he suspected something but brushed it off because being gay wasn’t even something mike considered possible. he’s never been exposed to the concept of that in real life… so why would he think it could ever apply to him or anyone he knows? much less his bff? **will was the same way!!** he saw vickie and robin kissing and we saw his avalanche. he didn’t know it was possible until he SAW IT.

well now, **mike has SEEN it.** will SAID IT in front of him. cue avalanche. that robin scene about signals and snowballs and avalanches couldn’t have been for nothing. they could’ve left it out, but chose not to.

it didn’t click for mike then, but i bet you my left eye that it clicked when will looked at him and laid his heart out in that coming out scene. mike has a look of sadness on his face, meanwhile everyone else just looks… a bit surprised? proud even! meanwhile mike looks *FLOORED*. big contrast, made obvious with the camera being focused on mike.

from what i understand, will only came out to everyone because he had no choice. he knew he would be left vulnerable if he didn’t spill, hence why he had to have everyone present. he had to be SURE that he was still loved and accepted so that vecna couldn’t use it against him. i think the reason he cried so hard, *unlike ANY will byers cry i’ve ever seen*, is because he lied again. i think he’s trying to convince himself that mike couldn’t love him and be okay with it. will is KNOWN for underestimating what he’s feeling and having low expectations. he never speaks up. he even tells us in his monologue that vecna was what drove him to finally speak up. *but mike realized something in that scene.* **what if will just narrated mikes internal monologue without realizing??** hence why we haven’t seen mike’s pov yet?

**will opened a door mike didn’t know existed,** which is why mike feels SO out of character here. 

*i know michael wheeler and this isn’t him.* 

*i guarantee that mike will talk to will 1 on 1.*

it’s coming. mike is gonna ask why will didn’t confide in him, how he feels terrible for not knowing. **this is the time for the chekovs gun to fire.**

*“so that painting…”*

we were **PROMISED** the painting would be relevant, and it is!! the s4 plot was centered around it, and the s5 character arcs are as well. *mike is the heart and will loves mike.* without the painting being addressed, the california plot was completely useless to the story. if the painting isn’t addressed, mike will be reduced to “just another teenage dirtbag”. i doubt they’ll let that happen, especially since s5 has been mikes “redemption arc”. they wouldn’t backtrack it.

they also wouldn’t save the painting reveal until after a rejection. firstly, will doesn’t know how mike feels. he just assumed that mike could never love him because he’s different (s4 parallel perhaps?)… but how does he know? he never talked to mike. if the painting is brought up after will comes out, which is the only option now, it can only go one way. **MIKE WILL KNOW.** there is nothing will can say to continue to cover that up now that he’s out. mike had to have put 2 and 2 together. 

that van scene took 12 hours to film. they had to have filmed additional scenes. could these be used? idk. *but i know that mike probably had SOME kind of epiphany when will came out.*

think about it- no romance scenes with mike and el and it’s heavily implied that el will be taking off or dying (hopefully not dying tho) in the finale. el is also very supportive of will in his outing scene, might i add. *el’s not stupid. she probably either knows or will know.*

**at this point, it’s either mike avalanche, or single mike**. we still haven’t seen the “emotional weight” finn supposedly carried in the final episodes according to the directors. he’s been emotionally absent mostly so far. more so than volume 1. they wouldn’t say that if they KNEW this was an outright LIE. they lie about spoilers, but not actors roles like that.

**this is a major character inconsistency for mike.** that’s why everyone is saying his arc felt SO strange this volume. it’s uncomfortable to watch. he’s been so present for will this season, why is he suddenly acting alienated? just like he did at the airport??

we know will isn’t telling the whole truth, because he didn’t admit he liked **MIKE.** just that it was **SOMEONE**. who’s to say he didn’t lie about the tammy thing too? given the context of the scene, will still doesn’t even sound 100% sure of himself when admitting the “tammy” part. will has a hard time lying to mike’s face, and this was no exception. this to me read more like setting up for more of the emotional arc, not a final acceptance. will ALREADY accepted himself earlier, and it gave him **POWERS.** *giving him the exact same arc a second time but with no major plot twist this time is just redundant.*

do not give up now. i think im onto something here. and if im wrong, crucify me. a captain always goes down with his ship.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live?

1pw0c1c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pw0c1c,Small agroforestry coffee farm in eastern Sierra Leone – irrigation input needed.,"Hope you guys are digesting Christmas well so far...

We’re developing a Coffea stenophylla agroforestry farm in Komende village (Kenema District). Elevation ranges from ~155 m at a river at the bottom of the land to ~200 m on the upper plots. About 3,000 young coffee plants are established mainly on the mid–upper slope, intercropped with banana (within blocks) and avocado (mainly along boundaries).

There is no grid power and vehicles cannot cross the river. We’ve tested water from the stream and a hand-dug well: the stream has higher turbidity, the well water is very clean. Coffee plants are mulched with dry rice husk for dry-season protection, but some irrigation is still needed.

A borehole was suggested, but it’s not feasible now due to cost, access for a drill rig, and lack of site/yield guarantees. Current options are stream pumping to tanks, or a hand-dug well with tanks and gravity drip. Budget is limited.

We’re leaning toward a low-risk setup (hand-dug well + storage + gravity drip, stream as backup) and would appreciate input on:
– Optimal placement of a hand-dug well on sloped land
– Minimum depth/diameter/lining worth doing for irrigation
– Tank placement (uphill for gravity vs near well)
– Realistic late-dry-season yields (L/day) from hand-dug wells
– Common failure modes to avoid

Ill be happy to share more information if needed.

———

The rain wasn't real but I could swear I felt the drops on my cheeks. The faces of the gargoyles at the roof of Shadowfang Bastion looked creepy in the light of never-going-out torches. Are they like virtual Mona Lisas? I felt their eyes following me even if I wiggled to the right or to the left. Pff. I'll just turn away.

I looked up at the engravings on the castle walls, and they gave me the vibes of the Moria entrance from the Lord of the Rings. I had never really noticed them before. The game gibberish stated “Think twice, count thrice, all your teammates turn to mice”-I read it out loud, and.. did not understand shit.

The air smelled like wet dirt, and it was so strong I almost believed it was under my nose. This weather honestly made me feel like cuddling up on a sofa with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea instead of this. But then I intentionally scrabbed the floor mat with my bare toes and it grounded me. I was actually in our gaming room and my favourite person was sitting right next to me at his desk. The sensor behind my ear made smells and temperature sensations feel real in this virtual world.

The Shadowfang Bastion... my legs almost didn’t want to move when I tried approaching the castle entrance, exhausted from countless runs with no loot. 

But what are you gonna do? I need this dungeon for the ring to improve my stats, so... Here we go. 

And I wasn't alone in this endeavour. Battousay the Unbreakable, my partner in crime and life, was here too. With his shaved head and neatly trimmed beard, pierced eyebrow and bottom lip, he was a Paladin through and through—white-golden armour, glowing sword—but there was something in his posture, that quiet storm calm, that made him look like someone who’d accidentally joined a cathedral raid group after losing a bar fight.

""Sooo..."", he said. ""Three more people and we can go"". 

Our pick-up group teammates didn't make us wait long. One by one, they appeared before the dungeon as soon as Batto signaled the readiness to accept new players into our group. He was going to tank this dungeon, whereas I decided to play the (scratched) sexy nurse role. So, all we needed were three damage dealers. 

First, a female dracthyr materialized. The nickname above her head stated ""Dractine the Smoldering"". Her piercingly red serpent eyes contrasted well with her obsidian-scaled skin, very gothic-esque. While I was admiring her appearance, she started to eat some buff food -  mushroom and chicken stew. Well, tastes differ, right? 

Right after Dractine, a warrior named HighwayHowl joined our little group. He didn't have a title yet - I guess it was because he hadn't been playing long. It was a tall man, with a thin layer of silver hair on his head. He was wearing a crooked wooden helmet, chainmail-like duct-taped tinsel. Awkwardly charming. He greeted everyone, waving his hand with a small sword he was carrying.

The last DD wasn't hard to find. ""VashStampede the Stinkiest"" a Beast Master Hunter, bounced in, his pet wolves snarling and his mic too loud. “ALOHA EVERYBODY”, - he shouted and on the word “Everybody” his entrance ringtone started playing. 

“EVERYBODY DANCE NOW 💃!”

And we did, oh we did! His wild energy was contagious! I saw it right away - that guy treats chaos like cardio, and he kinda reminded me of the squirrel that drank way too much coffee. 

As the group leader, Batto prompted everyone to confirm their readiness.

The sound of clinging swords and swooshes of conjured ice came before I could see anything. DAMN, THEY HAVE ALREADY STARTED! And I am still loadiiiiing, NOOOOOOOO!

I started clicking my mouse vigorously as if it could speed up the loading progress. It didn't, of course, but it did, alright? Ohh finally, raid frames appear, I can see the epileptic health bars of my teammates - the passive tank healing kept them alive a bit. HUH, it looks like an overpull? Waaaay too many mobs there! Ok, no more time to panic, I need to sprint in the middle of the action!

I quickly applied heal-over-time effects on Howl, Dractine and Vash, nothing left for Batto as I only had three stacks. But he's gonna be FIIINE, tanks usually have pretty great self-heal. I was punching mobs as hard as a could - my knuckles started even bleeding a bit, but I felt no pain. With every kick, each scratch and bruise on people's bodies healed up instantly with my peppermint-scented spells (Yes, I bought the skin. Yes, it was overpriced. No regrets.). 

Nobody was talking. The hunter was jumping here and there, dancing to music that only he could hear. His wolves grew bigger and red during the combat, and their eyes were filled with blood from tearing the guardian knights and ice mages apart, piece by piece. With each kill command the hunter gave, I heard a beast growl in-between.

These mobs, really...  Oh, the mage is casting his deadly Ice Blast on Dractine - NOPE, not this time! I interrupted it with a leg kick to his stomach, disorienting him for a few seconds. Here, girl, take this HoT in advance, a big AoE damage is coming. You too, Vash. You t- oh, Howl, sorry, did not notice your health bar dropping! Here, take a big Vitality Sip.

The warrior's health bar turned from orange to green again - a pleasant sight for healer's eyes. I don't know why, but the first pull is always the hardest for me, because I need to get into it. Everyone is so fast all the time and I lose myself, not knowing what to focus on first.

One by one, the knights and mages fell dead. Some of the corpses were still smoldering from Dractine's fire spells, and some had clear wolf bite marks still bleeding out. But what's important, my allies were all healthy as new. I threw HoTs on each of them just for cool visual effect, I like seeing them all covered in green transparent clouds of mists.

We went on to the next pack along the castle corridor. I was curious to how the overpull even happened - did Batto throw his shield at the wrong mob, aggroing the additional ones?

""Sorry Babe, I was loading too long. What happened?"" I asked Batto, covering the Howl in a gust of mist to heal his bleeding arm. 

""That shit hunter pulled an extra pack that we didn't need! I even marked it as a DANGER ZONE, but he gotta be blind. Fucking hunters, ey, they always pull!"" - he replied with frustration in the real world so that our PUG doesn't hear him.

""Heh, yea. Once a hunter, always a hunter..."" I chuckled.

Ah, Spectral Mages ahead. My interrupt is ready, good.

The mobs turned all their attention to the tank, once he threw a shield at one of them, which bounced to each member of the pack and silenced them for a few seconds. Not being able to cast anything, they just stood there and tried to scratch Batto with their long fingernails, but did he care about, in his thick, shining armor? Pff, of course not! I cast a few HoTs, and just kept punching the mobs, in case someone's scratch would go too deep.

But then those few wonderful seconds of silence were over. Three of the mages started casting Aethereal Burns on the players. If only I could see on whom... ah Dractine dispelled herself right away, Attagirl!. The second burn was on me, and before dispelling it, I moved to the left a bit, as the ground under my feet started turning dark purple and was growing in size and it was damaging me as I was standing in it. Because, why interrupt a spell if you can dispel it afterwards?

But the third one was on the Howl, and damn it, I spent my precious dispel on myself!

The warrior didn't seem to notice his health was dropping at all. He was just swooping his sword left and right, fixating on the mob with the lowest priority, and my heal at this moment was insufficient...

“Howl, wanna move out of that area?"" - I griped. But he didn't hear me. His health bar was having a seizure, and I was running out of mana trying to heal him up.

“Rescue initiated!”- Dractine's voice rang out, triumphant. “NO—WAIT—” She grabbed Howl with her spell and yeeted him out of danger. Except, not really. She dropped him directly into MY glowing purple puddle. He landed with a sound that wasn’t in the game files. “OH FUCK I AM SO SORRY!!!"" she quickly apologized, but it was inevitable. Our warrior made his final sword swoosh and fell on the ground, breathless. Shit.

""Ehm.... how did that happened exactly?"" he could still talk even though his character was dead. 

""In short, don't stand in the shit"",- I replied, swooping my leg in the air and paralyzing the remaining mobs for a few seconds. ""I guess, you didn't get a warning that your health was dropping or something. Use a defensive next time"".

""Do you know which one is it? I am fairly new to the game"" - it was so weird to see a corpse talking. The voice was coming out of nowhere while we were still fighting the monsters.

""Mhm, I haven't played the warrior class yet, so I don't know, "" ah, Batto chainpulled another pack. He knows what he's doing, it's okay.

""Ye, you've got like three,""  Vash chimed in ""the one with the shield on it, that's a short cooldown, the one with like iron armour, that's like 3 min cooldown and one with a chick on it, it's 4 or 5 minutes or so.""

""Ah thanks, I see them now....""

""You can release by the way. We are not in the boss room, so we aren't going to battle resurrect you"". 

""Copy that"", and his characted dissipated into the air. 

Batto moved the pack out of the constantly emerging puddles, chainpulling another one into it. Even with us interrupting and stunning the mobs, it wasn't enough to just stand in one place. I was vigorously dispelling and healing up the incoming damage from the puddles.

Turned to the entrance of the dungeon - our warrior was running towards us, holding a scroll in his hands - he was reading through his skills.

""Oh hey! What does this skill do?"" he ran up to one casting mage and pushed his elbow into the monster's stomach.

The mage folded in half and his voice faltered. He stopped casting his deadly purple puddles.

""Would you look at that!"" I cheered. ""Someone learned to interrupt an enemy!""

The Howl looked proud as hell, his crooked helmet made the sight even more charming. He finished off the mob while he was down and proceeded to the rest of the pack.

Once the last mob was finished, Batto gave me a signal and I immediately started drinking my mana tea. Boy, these puddles really require a lot of healing on my part. I wish people used defensives more often...

The final room left. It's boss time, baby.

---------------------------------------------------------------

The boss room opened into a vast hall that had once been meant for feasts and ceremonies. Long tables were gone, banners rotted into shadows, and the air felt hollow, like the place had been holding its breath for centuries.

At the far end, on a raised platform, sat Shadowfang — a spirit king slouched on his throne. Heavy iron chains ran from his wrists down into the stone floor, as if even death hadn’t been enough to keep him still. His pale face wore an expression of eternal boredom.

It lasted exactly one second.

Batto’s shield flew across the room and smashed into his face.

Shadowfang’s head snapped up, chains rattling as his boredom twisted into fury.

The tank snuck himself into the corner of the room and the boss moved with him. I sprinted to them and Howl joined me, making a battle roar and increasing his attack power for 20 seconds. Dractine and Vash kept a bit far, but they also gave everything they got. 

Shadowfang's skin was scorching from the dragon fire burns, Vash's zoo of animals was attacking him from the back, Howl's turned into a tornado of sorts. But all his attention was at our tank.

Batto did not flinch even one bit. His armour was a bit damaged, but it wasn't critical. I admired his almost rehearsed movements - holding the shield up and blocking the hits, slashing the boss with the light, or lighting up his armour so that it was almost blinding. It was like he wasn't playing the paladin - HE WAS BEING the paladin.

After the first thirty seconds, Shadowfang raised his hands into the air and started swirling.

All of us jumped back and started skipping to avoid being hit by the chains. Wait, there's supposed to be five of us? Oh, no.

The warrior was still fighting the boss! Being totally unaware of his surroundings, he kept hitting the boss like nothing was happening. He also did not even notice how one chain hit him. BOOM 20% of life gone. Next one, BOOM 20% more. My tiny little HoT couldn't help the situation - gonna need to cast a heal, another, but it is not enough.... AND THE CASTING IS TAKING SO LOOOOONG! Why is he still standing there???

As he dropped to 2% of his health, I thought he'd be dead already. But then, a light figure appeared above him, protecting him from the damage. It was a spirit of a woman with black curly hair, dressed in a silky light blue dress - she was the incarnation of a goddess or something. Howl looked at her, astonished, and stopped moving.

""What the h..."" he exhaled.

After 5 seconds, the woman disappeared, and Dractine used this cue to rescue Howl and put him far enough from the boss. We kept jumping and he still looked dazzled.

""She looked just like my wife...""

No time to respond. The boss stopped swirling, and the fight continued.

Suddenly, it all went dark - I couldn’t move nor see clearly what was going on. I squinted a bit and saw that Shadowfang had a short buff on, stunning us for a few seconds. Through the blur and uncertainty I was able to recognize our tank unaffected by the hit. He was covered in a protective bubble, reflecting all the incoming damage. 

“Nobody interrupted the boss…” he explained to everyone.

When the boss’s health reached 50%, something changed. Three circles appeared on the floor. Eeeeeh what do I do - step in or avoid? I don’t remember this mechanic! 

Then I heard a loud noise. That was new to me. Or perhaps just something that had always been glossed over until now.

BONG!

WHAT IS HAPPENING?!

I wasn’t the only one confused - my teammates were wiggling around the circles, unsure what to do and looking at each other. Nobody had a clue.

BONG!

Ohhh man, something is gonna happen in the next bong! What do I dooooooo?

BONG! 

I felt my body metamorphosed. The boss grew in size so much he could step on me and squish me like a cockroach. I looked at my hands - they were no longer human hands, they were animal paws! I was a mouse!!!

What now, what now?! I tried running the circle, but my legs were so short that the distance was 10 times bigger than before. As I was running for my life, I looked around me - everyone else was also turned into mice, and the damage we were getting increased with each bong. Shit!

As I reached the circle, I turned back into myself. But my teammates didn’t, and their health bars were dark orange already! And, as I was the only one with a player form, I was… targeted by the boss.

Shadowfang started slowly moving towards me, his chains dangling and dragging on the floor. He’s gonna kill me. We’re all gonna die…

All of a sudden, I had an epiphany. “Think twice, count thrice, all your teammates turn to mice”. That’s it! I used my mass dispel skill and everyone turned back to normal. Batto taunted the boss and his gaze turned to the tank. Phew.

Now I could heal up the damage that this phase caused. All focused on bringing Shadowfang down, playing the mechanic almost flawlessly - hopping when the chains were swirling, going into the spawning circles, interrupting the casts of the boss. We got him.

Ten percent of life left.
Seven.
Five.
Vash landed the final deathblow shot and Shadowfang fell on the ground breathless. The hunter's victory song We Are The Champions by Queen was playing in the background, and everyone exhaled with relief. A loot chest appeared next to the slayed boss.

""Oof, we did it!"" Howl exclaimed.

""Yeah, good job, Howl!"" said Batto, opening the  chest. ""If you have any questions, you can always ask me, I would be happy to help! Oh, the""tank trinket! FINALLY, on the 59th try, THANK YOU God of Random!""

""Thanks, Batto, that is kind!"" replied the warrior. ""Only gold for me...""

Vash looted a sad little ring. Green quality - not rare enough to care. He squinted, shrugged, and chucked it toward the evoker.

“Here, Dractine,” he said. “I see you still have the adventure ring. This should give you a little extra Stamina.”

""Appreciate it"", she caught the ring and put it on immediately as she also looted only gold.

""So, thanks for the run guys, see you next time"" - Vash waved goodbye and disconnected. Dractine followed suit.

I opened the chest and also got gold. Fuck this dungeon, really!

""Don't worry, Babe, maybe you will get it from the weekly vault. "" Batto comforted me, seeing my frown.

""Yea, maybe...""

""So, Howl,"" Batto turned to the warrior. ""You said you were new to the game? How long have you been playing?""

""Oh, just a couple of weeks. My son also plays this game with his wife, and he talks so much about it with me that I wanted to see what's all the fuss about. It's definitely not easy!""

""That is so cool that you do that! And what a coincidence, Chimpacta here is my wife, we also play together, just like your son :D""

""No kidding!"" The warrior looked puzzled.

So.. he has a son who's got a wife.. So he must be in his 50s or 60s? A rare sight in a world of online games.

Howl stood there for a moment longer, not logging out yet. His character shifted slightly, like he wasn’t sure where to move next.

Batto looked at him. Not the casual tank glance. Not the polite PUG one. Just a quiet, searching look.

The warrior met the paladin's look, nodded once - small and almost imperceptible - and disconnected.

It started about a year ago, we were watching a YouTube quiz video where you guess the celeb based on their eyes. He is notoriously terrible with celebrity names and faces; however, he guess this actress ASAP. I asked how he knew that and he said she's a good actress, very memorable. I asked what she is in and its a lot of movies where she's half or fully naked. I was laughing through my questioning, asking if that's why he knew her or if he's just watching for her figure. He laughed and said no, she's a good actress.

Since then, it comes to now and again - her being on his mind a lot. We recently went to coffee with friends and were talking about celebrity crushes. Everyone had debates and hear-me-outs on both male and female celebs, which was pretty fun to talk about. Then it was my partners turn and he was quick to say the actresses name. When asked about other actresses, he said no one but her.

I know a large part of me is insecure about this, but the fact that it is a consistent crush for the one actress really rubs me the wrong way. My partner is in a long process of dealing with a porn addiction. He has openly admitted to looking her up and watching sex scenes and nudity scenes in her movies and masturbating to them; he has watched a decent bit of her content at this point.

He isn't very open about it, but you can see it in his social media that she is prominent in his day to day life.

Am I wrong in feeling so down and hurt by this? I don't want to make this a bigger conversation with him than it has to be. I have celebrity crushes too, but I don't actively keep them in my mind or look for their sex scenes (if they even have any). I could be the exception and everyone else DOES think about their crushes often. Am I overreacting?

TL;DR
Partner talks about his celebrity crush often. He is bad with memories, but remembers her features and whatnot immediately. He has watched her explicit scenes in movies and masturbated to them, as well as follows her on multiple social media apps. He doesn't bring her up in conversation, but has her in his day to day life in his mind and on his phone. Am I wrong for feeling jealous and hurt?",0,1766741004.0,AIO,8,0.33,False

Let me put a bit of context to my question. I'm not talking about people who insist in order to get what they want, but people who for instance, keep pushing after someone rejected something from them (like, an invitation to go somewhere, a cup of coffee or tea, a sweet, etc).
I have seen this situation many times, where no matter how many times one person say no, the other keep pushing, eventually the first person gets frustrated and the second person feels offended.

I have seen myself there more than once in this and my intention is to understand better how to face these situations when I find somebody who won't take a no as a answer, to solve the situation in a diplomatic way.

# An Era of Globalisation

In the history of global commerce, the Middle Bronze Age from about 2000 to 1700 BC, is considered the ""first era of globalisation."" While the Assyrian merchants of Kanesh are the most famous case study, they were merely one of the actors in a massive, interlocking economic system.

Across the Middle East, four distinct trading spheres operated simultaneously. Each possessed unique administrative structures, financial instruments, and commodities, yet they interconnected to move goods from the mines in central Asia to the palaces of Crete, from the Indus valley to Anatolia.

# The Kārum System and the Kingdom of Kanesh

The most sophisticated private-enterprise system of the era was the Old Assyrian trade network. It utilised a ""colonial"" model, establishing permanent settlements (*kārū*) in foreign territory to facilitate the export of tin and textiles in exchange for Anatolian silver and gold.

Long before the Silk Road or the Hanseatic League, Assyrian merchants established a complex trading system that spanned the Middle East during the Middle Bronze Age. At the centre of this network was the *karum*, a unique settlement type that functioned as a commercial colony, legal enclave, and financial centre.

# The Kārum Phenomenon (c. 1950–1700 BC)

The term *kārum* (plural *kārū*) literally means ""quay"" or ""harbour"" in Akkadian. However, in the context of the Middle Bronze Age, specifically c. 1950 to 1700 BC, it referred to the trading districts established by Assyrian merchants in major Anatolian city-states.

While the city of Ashur, the capital of the Old Assyrian city state from 2025 to 1364 BC (in modern-day Iraq), served as the religious and political capital, the *kārū* acted as the operational nodes of a vast import-export business. These were not military colonies imposed by an empire, but commercial settlements established through treaties with local Anatolian rulers.

# The Political Status of Kanesh

Kanesh was the administrative centre of the entire colonial network. It served as the ""harbour"" where all caravans from Ashur arrived before goods were distributed to the interior.

# The Dual City

Physically, Kanesh comprised two distinct sections:

**The Citadel (Upper Mound):** The seat of the local Anatolian King and his administration.

**The** ***Kārum*** **(Lower Town):** The residential and commercial quarter where the Assyrian merchants lived.

It is from the ruins of the Lower Town that archaeologists have recovered the **Old Assyrian Archives of Kanesh,** colloquially known as the “Cappadocian"" texts, a staggering collection of over 23,000 cuneiform tablets. These documents, preserved when the city was destroyed by fire c. 1835 BC, provide a detailed ""snapshot"" of daily life, encompassing everything from loan contracts and judicial verdicts to intimate family letters. The tablets represent one of the largest and most significant archaeological finds in the ancient Middle East.

A common misconception is that Kanesh was an outpost of an Assyrian Empire. It was not. Throughout the Middle Bronze Age, Kanesh remained a sovereign Anatolian entity. **Kanesh** is located at the modern archaeological site of Kültepe in central Anatolia, in what is now modern-day **Turkey**. The Assyrian *kārum* was an extraterritorial commercial district, in effect a ""foreign quarter"", that operated strictly at the pleasure of the local ruler.

The political relationship between the Kingdom of Kanesh and the merchants of Ashur evolved through two distinct phases, shifting from a model of **treaty-based autonomy** to one of **imperial integration**.

**Phase I: The Era of Independent Sovereignty (Level II, c. 1950–1835 BC)**

During the period that produced the vast majority of the archives, Kanesh was an independent city-state ruled by a local King (*Rubā'um*). The relationship with the Assyrian *kārum* was defined by a strict legal framework known as the *mamītum* (sworn treaty).

**The Host-Guest Dynamic:** The Assyrians possessed **autonomy**, not sovereignty. They were granted the right to govern their own internal affairs, use their own weights and measures, and adjudicate disputes between Assyrians in their own courts. However, they held no territorial claim to the land of Kanesh.

**The Treaty Exchange:** The relationship was transactional. The King of Kanesh swore to protect the caravans from brigands and guarantee the merchants' property rights. In exchange, the *kārum* swore loyalty to the King and, most importantly for the king, agreed to the tax regime.

**Judicial Supremacy:** The limits of Assyrian power were clear. If a merchant committed a crime against a local Anatolian, or if a case involved smuggling to evade the *nīšātum* tax, the jurisdiction reverted to the Palace. The local King retained the power to imprison Assyrian nationals, a threat frequently mentioned in the letters of nervous smugglers.

During this period, independent Assyrian family firms generated immense wealth before the settlement was burned down. The fire baked the clay tablets, preserving them for us, but it forced the merchants to flee. About **90% of all tablets** found at Kültepe come from this layer.

**Phase II: The Imperial Capital (Level Ib, c. 1800–1700 BC)**

Following the destruction of the city c. 1835 BC, the political landscape shifted dramatically.

For about 35 years, the *kārum* was abandoned. There is a hiatus in the archives during this period.

The city was conquered by King Pithana of the rival city-state of Kussara. His son, the formidable **King Anitta**, subsequently moved his royal court to Kanesh, transforming it from a regional trading hub into the capital of the **Kingdom of Kussara**.

While the trade continued, the balance of power shifted. The Assyrian state, now under the rule of the expansionist King Shamshi-Adad I, attempted to exert more direct control over the *kārum*. Simultaneously, Anitta used the wealth generated by the trade to fund military campaigns that unified central Anatolia.

In this final phase, Kanesh was the administrative centre of an emerging empire, the precursor to the Hittites. The *kārum* remained an indispensable economic entity, but it now served the ambitions of a ""Great King"" (*Rubā'um Rabi'um*) rather than a local city-prince.

# The Asur Network

The network was extensive. While Kanesh was the administrative hub, texts mention over 35 different settlements involved in the trade. These were divided into two tiers:

**The** ***Kārum*****:** The primary trading colonies. Aside from Kanesh, major *kārū* existed at Purushaddum (a key copper centre), Wahshushana, and Durhumit.

**The** ***Wabartum*****:** Smaller trading stations or waystations located along the caravan routes, serving as rest stops and secondary markets.

# Keeping it in the Family

Unlike the state-run economies typical of the Late Bronze Age (such as those of Egypt or the Hittites), the *kārum* trade was driven by private enterprise. Wealthy families in Ashur operated as ""houses"" (*bētum*). The senior members remained in Ashur to procure goods and finance caravans, while the junior members (sons, nephews, or contracted agents) moved to the *kārū* in Anatolia to manage sales and logistics.

# Commodities and the ""Donkey Caravan""

The trade relied on a complicated arbitrage system, exploiting price differentials between Mesopotamia and Anatolia. The merchants utilised donkey caravans to transport goods over 1,000 kilometres of rugged terrain. Until the domestication of the ultra-hardy one humped camel, also known as the dromedary, in the early 1st millennium BC, the donkey was the preferred beast of burden.

**Fun Fact:** *The desert routes would not have been practicable without that first 'ship of the desert', the donkey. Donkeys evolved in northeast Asia from the wild ass in the early part of the 4th millennium BC. The impetus coming from pastoralists needing a beast of burden to carry products over an ever drier landscape.*

*In 3000 BC, or thereabouts, ten donkeys were buried beside a royal enclosure at Abydos. Five hundred years later, a donkey was worth four times that of a normal slave. Donkeys are able to carry 50 - 90 kilogrammes over a distance of 30 - 50 kilometres per day. They can survive on the roughest vegetation and can go without water for several days. The donkey marked the first improvement over human portage. Although not happy crossing expanses of true desert, the donkey is nimble footed and at home in the semi-arid environments of the Mediterranean. Not surprising then that they were soon a common sight all over the Middle East.*

*Until the domestication of the ultra-hardy one humped camel, also known as the dromedary, in the early 1st millennium BC, the donkey was the preferred beast of burden.*

**Exports to Anatolia:** The Assyrians brought **tin** (vital for making bronze) and high-quality **textiles**. The tin originated from distant sources in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan, with Ashur serving as the trans-shipment point.

**Imports to Ashur:** In return, the merchants sought **silver** and **gold**. Anatolia was rich in gold, silver and copper, which were scarce in Mesopotamia. The profits were immense; a shipment of tin could sell for double its purchase price in Ashur, and textiles could fetch a 300% profit margin.

# The Archives of the Merchants

The reconstruction of this economic history is based almost entirely on the ""Cappadocian Texts.""

They differ from almost every other Bronze Age archive. While the archives of Mari or Ebla document the activities of kings and temples, the Kanesh tablets are the private files of families. They provide a rare, unfiltered view of the ancient merchant ""middle class.""

**Fun Fact:** *For decades, scholars referred to these documents as ""Cappadocian"" because they appeared on the antiquities market in the late 19th century, sold by dealers in Kayseri (ancient Cappadocia). No one knew their origin until 1925, when the Czech philologist Bedřich Hrozný located the source at the mound of Kültepe. We now identify them properly as the Old Assyrian Archives of Kanesh.*

# Envelopes and ""Safe Deposit Boxes""

The physical nature of the texts reveals the merchants' obsession with security and legal proof.

**The Case Tablet:** Most legal contracts were enclosed in a clay envelope (a ""case""). The scribe would write the contract on the inner tablet, fire it or let it dry, wrap it in a thin layer of clay, and then rewrite the summary on the outside.

**Sealing:** Witnesses rolled their cylinder seals over the envelope, not the inner tablet. If a dispute arose, judges would break the envelope in court to reveal the original, unaltered text inside.

**Storage:** The tablets were not discarded. Families kept them in their homes in distinct archive rooms, stored in wooden boxes, wicker baskets, or clay jars, often arranged by year or topic.

# Capitalism and Complaint

Written in a simplified dialect of Old Assyrian cuneiform, which used fewer signs than standard Akkadian, implying a high rate of literacy among traders, the texts cover three main categories:

**The Tools of Finance**

The archives contain advanced financial instruments that historians previously thought were invented by the Greeks or Romans thousands of years later.

**The** ***Naruqqum*** **(""Money-Bag""):** Multiple investors in Ashur pooled their gold (the ""bag"") and entrusted it to a travelling merchant for a set period, often 10 years, sometimes 12. The merchant traded with this capital, and upon his return, profits were divided between the investors and the manager.

**Bearer Cheques:** Merchants issued debt notes that could be transferred or sold to third parties, effectively creating a system of paperless, or rather, ""clay-based"", currency circulation.

**The Logistics of Trade**

Thousands of texts are purely administrative, detailing the mundane realities of the donkey caravans. They list the taxes paid to local Anatolian rulers, the price of animal fodder, the death of donkeys on the mountain passes, and the bribes paid to bandits. They meticulously record the prices of tin and textiles, allowing modern economists to reconstruct 19th-century BC inflation rates.

**The Personal Letters**

Perhaps the most interesting and revealing aspect of the archives is the personal correspondence. Since the heads of the firms often remained in Ashur while their sons and agents lived in Kanesh, the collection includes thousands of personal letters.

These are not formal diplomatic missives. They are urgent, emotional, and often petty.

**The Wives of Ashur:** As highlighted by Cécile Michel, the wives left behind in Ashur were active business partners. They produced the textiles for export. Their letters are full of complaints about their husbands' laziness, demands for wool, and updates on household finances. Some things never change.

**Family Feuds:** The texts document inheritance disputes, accusations of fraud between brothers, and fathers castigating sons for spending too much money on wine and women.

One famous letter (CCT 3 6b) from a merchant, Assur-idi to his son Puzur-Assur reads:

*""While your brothers are becoming men, you remain a child! You have abandoned the business to chase after women... You have not sent me the silver from the textiles... You have squandered my house... Please, if you are my son, send me the silver! Do not make me the laughing stock of the city.""*

Another (letter CCT 4 32a) was sent from an anxious investor/merchant in Ashur to his agent/partner in Kanesh, who is delaying payment:

*""Why aren't you sending me the silver? Make sure to send me the silver, lest I write and they discredit you in the kārum! … You have changed your attitude several times. You haven't sent me so much as a tiny tablet. Make sure to send \[the silver\]!...You are behaving like a man who does not know me. If you are my brother, send me the silver. Do not delay!...I am sick. I am dying of a broken heart because of your silver. You are enjoying yourself there while I am suffering here. Send me the silver so I can be at peace!""*

**Historical Significance**

The Cappadocian texts are unique because they document a society where the **market**, rather than the **state**, was the primary driver of interaction. They show us a world of contracts, courts, and credit that operated across borders, bound together not by the power of a king, but by the mutual interest of profit.

**Fun Fact:** *In Bronze Age Anatolia, the primary local unit of weight was the* ***mina*** *(or mana), though it often coexisted and was compared with the Mesopotamian shekel-based system, especially during the Old Assyrian trade colony period.* 

***Mina (mana)****: This was the fundamental local unit for trade, particularly for commodities like copper. The Anatolian mina weighed about ten percent less than the contemporary Mesopotamian mina.*

***Shekel (šiqlu or gin)****: While the mana was the main local unit, the shekel (a smaller unit) was a standard of the Mesopotamian system also found in use. The shekel typically ranged from 8 to 14 grams, with different local variations (e.g., Syrian shekel of 9.3-9.4g, Mesopotamian shekel of 8.3g).*

***Talent (kikkaru or gun)****: The talent was the largest unit, typically equivalent to 60 minas, and was used for measuring large quantities of metal.* 

*Weights were often made of hematite or other hard stones and were sometimes shaped like animals (ducks, lions, frogs) to prevent tampering. Due to variations in standards, merchants had to regularly verify weights and correct discrepancies.* 

*A Bronze Age talent varied but was generally around 30 kilograms (66 lbs), based on the Babylonian/Mesopotamian system of 60 minas, representing the heaviest load a normal person could carry, though some Aegean standards aimed for slightly heavier loads around 29 kg, while later Greek systems differed, with Attic talents around 25.86 kg, showing regional variation. An average donkey could carry two talents, about 60 kilogrammes.*

# Administrative and Economic Structure: The Ghazaryan Analysis

Recent scholarship, including the work of Robert P. Ghazaryan (*Administrative and Political System and Economy of the Kingdom of Kanesh*, 2022), has shifted focus from the Assyrian merchants to the structure of the local Anatolian state they inhabited.

While the *kārum* handled the logistics of international trade, it operated within the sovereignty of the **Kingdom of Kanesh**. Ghazaryan’s analysis of the archives reveals a highly structured local bureaucracy that managed the interface between the foreign merchants and the local agricultural economy.

# The Structure of the Kingdom of Kanesh

The archives portray the Kingdom of Kanesh as a well developed city-state. At its head stood the King (*rubā’um*), often ruling alongside a Queen (*rubātum*) who held significant independent power. Beneath them was a hierarchy of officials who regulated both the agrarian base and the commercial sector.

Ghazaryan highlights specific titles that appear in the texts, revealing the state's priorities:

**The** ***Rabi Simmiltim*****:** Often translated as the ""Chief of the Stairway,"" this was the second-in-command to the King. This official frequently acted as the primary liaison with the Assyrian *kārum*, handling legal disputes and trade treaties.

**Sector Chiefs:** The administration employed specialised officials such as the *rabi rē'im* (Chief Shepherd), *rabi kirānim* (Chief of Wine/Vineyards), and *rabi adrim* (Chief of the Threshing Floor).

# The ""Double Economy""

Ghazaryan emphasises that while Kanesh is famous for international trade, its internal economy remained deeply rooted in agriculture and stockbreeding. The ""Cappadocian"" tablets reveal that the local palace coordinated massive grain production (*uṭṭutum*, specifically barley and wheat) and maintained an irrigation system funded by user fees (*gamrum*).

However, the international trade was not separate from the state, it was a revenue generating engine. The local palace held the right of **nīšātum**, a tax on incoming caravans. The King had the right of pre-emption, allowing him to buy a percentage of the best textiles and tin before they hit the open market.

# Legal Integration

The archives demonstrate a remarkable level of legal integration. The Assyrians had their own court in the *kārum* for internal disputes, but cases involving locals or major crimes fell under the jurisdiction of the local palace. The treaties ensured the merchants' safety on the roads in exchange for tax revenue, creating an interdependent relationship between the private Assyrian firms and the Anatolian state apparatus.

# Decline of the Karum system

The Kanesh *kārum* and the Old Assyrian network had disintegrated by around 1700 BC. The disappearance of the Kanesh *kārum* was not caused by a single event, but by a geopolitical collapse at both ends of the supply chain.

The peaceful, decentralised world of independent city-states that had allowed private trade to flourish was violently replaced by an era of aggressive territorial empires.

# The Disruption of the ""Supply"" (Collapse of Assyria)

For the network to function, the city of Ashur had to be stable enough to finance caravans and secure the routes across Northern Mesopotamia. By 1700 BC, Ashur was in crisis.

**The Death of the Emperor:** The trade of the later period (Level Ib) had been propped up by King **Shamshi-Adad I**. When he died (c. 1776 BC), his ""Kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia"" disintegrated into civil war.

**The Rise of Babylon:** To the south, **Hammurabi of Babylon** began aggressively expanding. His wars disrupted the flow of silver and tin, and he eventually subjugated Ashur, turning it into a vassal state. A vassal city fighting for its survival had no surplus capital to invest in risky foreign ventures.

**The Hurrian Migrations:** Perhaps most critically, the land routes between Ashur and Kanesh, across the Jezira and Taurus mountains, were severed by the mass migration of **Hurrian** tribes. These warlike groups took control of the mountain passes, making the cost of protection prohibitively high for private merchants.

# The Disruption of the ""Demand"" (The Anatolian Wars)

Trade requires stability. The ""Golden Age"" (Level II) worked because Anatolia was a patchwork of small, stable city-states that competed economically. By 1700 BC, this system was being destroyed by the **Unification Wars**.

**The Rise of the Hittites:** The region was consumed by warfare as the kings of Kussara , Pithana and Anitta, and later the early Hittite rulers such as Labarna, sought to unify the peninsula under one ruler.

**Destruction of Markets:** These were not wars of conquest for tribute, they were often wars of annihilation. Anitta famously destroyed the city of Hattusa and sowed the ground with weeds. You cannot sell luxury textiles to a city that has been burned to the ground. Hattusa was later rebuilt but the damage had been done.

**Kanesh Destroyed (Again):** The archaeological layer **Level Ib** ends with a thick layer of destruction debris. Kanesh was sacked during these unification struggles. Unlike the previous destruction in 1835 BC, the merchants did not return.

# The New Economic Model

Even if the routes had remained open, the *political* environment had changed in a way that made the *kārum* system obsolete.

**From Contract to Tribute:** The rising Hittite Empire operated on a different economic model. The Old Assyrian trade was based on **contracts** between equals. The Hittite state was based on **tribute** and a command economy. A centralised empire generally prefers to seize resources or control production directly rather than rely on foreign middlemen who siphon off profits.

**State Monopoly:** As the Hittite state solidified, trade became a royal monopoly. The private ""family firms"" of Ashur, with their independent courts and complex financial instruments, were incompatible with the totalitarian nature of the new Hittite administration.

By 1700 BC, the era of the private merchant prince was over; the era of the warrior-king had begun.

# The Maritime Persian Gulf Network

While Assyria dominated the northern land routes, the southern maritime trade was controlled by the mercantile power of **Dilmun** (modern Bahrain) in the Persian Gulf. This network connected Mesopotamia with the Indus Valley Civilisation (Meluhha) and the copper mines of Magan (Oman).

Ships from the Indus Valley (Meluhha) were heavy, ocean-going vessels that hesitated to navigate the marshes of the Tigris-Euphrates delta. Conversely, Mesopotamian river boats could not handle the Indian Ocean monsoons. Dilmun was the safe harbour in the middle where they met to swap cargos.

**Fun Fact:** *Often described in Mesopotamian mythology as a pristine ""Garden of Eden"" where death and disease did not exist, the archaeological reality was perhaps even more impressive. Dilmun was the world's first true* ***entrepôt****, a free-trade zone that produced little of its own but controlled the flow of the known world's wealth.*

Trading between different civilisations is a nightmare of logistics. How do you sell Indus ivory for Babylonian barley when the two cultures use different currencies, languages, and measurement systems?

Dilmun solved this by creating a standardised ""conversion interface.""

**The Dilmun Standard:** Archaeologists have found a unique system of stone weights in Bahrain. These weights were mathematically calibrated to be compatible with *both* the Indus binary system and the Mesopotamian sexagesimal system. A merchant could weigh gold in Dilmun and know exactly what it was worth in both Harappa and Ur.

**The Seal**: While Mesopotamians used *cylinder* seals (rolled onto clay), the Indus people used *square* stamp seals. Dilmun developed a hybrid identity: the Circular Stamp Seal. These have been found in India and Iraq, serving as the ""corporate logo"" of the Gulf merchants, certifying bundles of goods as they moved across borders.

# Trade with the Indus Valley Civilisation

Dilmun funnelled exotic goods from the Indus Valley into the Middle East.

**Carnelian:** Deep red beads, highly sought after for Mesopotamian jewellery.

**Lapis Lazuli:** Though originally from Afghanistan, it flowed down the Indus river and through the Gulf.

**Ivory:** Used for inlay work in royal palaces.

**""Fish Eyes"":** The Mesopotamian term for **Pearls**, which were harvested locally in the Gulf waters around Bahrain.

Whilst the cargoes coming in from the Indus valley were exotic and valuable, the lifeblood of this network was **copper**.

# Trade with Oman

Texts from Ur refer to the ""Mountain of Copper"" (Magan).  Copper that came from **Magan** (modern Oman), a rugged land of mountains and mines south of Dilmun at the mouth of the Persian Gulf.

In the Early Bronze Age, Mesopotamian kings sailed directly to Oman to get it. But by 2000 BC, the Dilmunites had monopolised the route. They bought the raw copper from Oman, shipped it to Bahrain, and then sold it to the Mesopotamians at a markup.

The scale was industrial. Administrative texts from the city of Ur record single shipments containing **18,000 kilograms** of copper ingots arriving from Dilmun.

# The Alik Tilmun and the ""Ea-nasir"" Incident

We know a surprising amount about the people involved in this trade. In the southern Mesopotamian city of Ur, there was a specific guild of merchants known as the ***alik Tilmun,*** ""Those who go to Dilmun.""

These were private venturers who pooled capital (similar to the Assyrian *Naruqqum*) to fund dangerous sea voyages. They lived in specific quarters of the city and paid tithes to the temple of the Goddess Ningal.

**The World's Oldest Customer Complaint:** The most famous relic of this trade is a clay tablet sent to a merchant named **Ea-nasir** (c. 1750 BC). Ea-nasir was a major player in the Dilmun copper trade; he was also a crook.

A customer named Nanni wrote a furious letter to him, which survives today:

*""When you came, you said to me: 'I will give Gimil-Sin (when he comes) fine quality copper ingots.' You left then but you did not do what you promised me... What do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me with such contempt?""*

This letter may well be the first ever recorded customer complaint. The Dilmun trade was a competitive market where individual merchants haggled over ingot quality, currency exchange rates, and delivery times.

# The Mechanics of Trade

While we know exactly how the Kanesh trade was administered because we have their own internal files, we look at the Dilmun trade ""from the outside."" We have the records of the Mesopotamians who *went* there, but archaeologists have not yet found the indigenous archives of Dilmun itself.

**Administration**

Whilst the Kanesh system was a colonial model, Assyrians moved to Anatolia, built a city, and governed themselves, the Dilmun system was an expeditionary model, merchants lived in Mesopotamia (Ur) and launched voyages to Dilmun.

**The ""Alik Tilmun"" Guild:** The trade was administered through a guild-like organisation in the city of Ur called the *alik Tilmun* (""Goers to Dilmun"").

**The Overseer:** The merchants were not entirely independent. They answered to an official called the **ugula dam-gar** (Chief Merchant), who acted as a liaison between the private traders and the Palace/Temple.

**The Tithe:** Administration was largely about tax collection. Upon returning from Dilmun, the ships docked at the *Kar-niskum* , “the quay of the tithe” in Ur. The temple of the goddess Ningal took a percentage of the copper and pearls as a mandatory offering.

Although we lack their written records, the archaeology shows that a strong state administration existed on the island.

**Standardisation as Control:** The fact that Dilmun enforced a unified weight system (the ""Dilmun Standard"") that differed from the Sumerian system implies a central authority, probably a Palace, that inspected markets. If you wanted to trade in Bahrain, you had to play with their weights.

**Legal Recourse**

In Kanesh, if a deal went sour, the merchants went to the *kārum* court and we have the verdicts. In the Dilmun trade, legal recourse was messier because it involved crossing sovereign borders.

**No ""Extraterritorial"" Rights:** Unlike the Assyrians in Kanesh, the Mesopotamian merchants in Dilmun did not have their own courts on the island. They were foreigners in a sovereign kingdom. If they were cheated in Dilmun, they likely had to appeal to the King of Dilmun, but we have no record of how that worked.

**Domestic Litigation:** Most legal action took place **back home in Ur**.

Investors, like the *nadītu* women (see below), would sue the merchants if they returned without the promised profit.

These cases were heard by the Judges of the King of Ur or in the Temple of Shamash, the god of justice.

We have court records from Ur where a merchant swears an oath by the life of the King that his ship really did sink, to avoid being jailed for embezzlement.

**Reputational Law:** The ""Ea-nasir"" letters suggest that in the absence of a shared international court, merchants relied on **reputation**. Nanni (the angry customer) couldn't easily sue Ea-nasir (who was perhaps currently at sea or in Dilmun), so he destroyed Ea-nasir’s credit rating by bad-mouthing him to other merchants.

**Paying for goods using ""Money of Account""**

There were no coins in the Bronze Age, those were invented in Lydia (Anatolia) over 1,000 years later. However, the trade was not simple barter.

The Dilmunites used what economists call **""Money of Account.""**

**The Standard of Value:** Prices were calculated in **Silver**. Even if no silver physically changed hands, the value was pegged to it.

A merchant might trade textiles for copper. He would calculate: ""These textiles are worth 10 shekels of silver. I expect 10 shekels' worth of copper in return.""

**The Medium of Exchange:** In Kanesh, the merchants physically moved Silver and Gold. The Assyrians were effectively moving ""cash"" (silver) to buy goods.

In Dilmun, the merchants usually used Commodity Money.

**Silver:** Mesopotamians did bring silver rings, coils, or scrap (*hacksilber*) to Dilmun to pay for goods.

**Copper:** Once the copper arrived in Mesopotamia, *it* became a currency. You could pay your rent or buy a field using copper ingots, as their value was stable and recognised.

**Grain & Wool:** The ships leaving Ur would be loaded with barley, oil, and wool. These were used as currency in Dilmun, which, being a desert island, couldn't grow enough food to feed its population.

# The Decline of Dilmun

The Dilmun network thrived from about 2000 to 1700 BC. Its decline coincided with the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation. When the great cities of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa fell into decline, the eastern supply of ivory and carnelian dried up. Simultaneously, the Kassite dynasty in Babylon opened up new overland routes to the east, bypassing the Gulf.

Dilmun remained an important regional centre, but its golden age had faded, leaving behind thousands of burial mounds and the ruins of the great Saar Temple as reminders of its former mercantile power.

# The Investors of Sippar

In Babylonia, what is now southern Iraq, in the city of Sippar, a refined financial network developed that mirrored the Assyrian system but with distinct legal innovations. This network largely funded the trade that fed into the Gulf and River routes.

A unique feature of the Sippar network was the role of the *nadītu* women. These were women from elite families who lived in a *gagûm,* or cloister, attached to the temple of the Sun god Shamash.

Forbidden to marry, these women used their dowries to become aggressive investment bankers. They financed traders, the *alik Tilmun,*  to conduct expeditions south.

The legal instrument of choice was the *tappūtum*, what we might call today a limited partnership contract. The investor, often a *nadītu*, provided the gold, and the merchant provided the labour. They agreed to split the net profit equally after the return of the capital.

Sippar acted as the northern terminus for the Gulf trade. Goods arriving from Dilmun were offloaded in the south, brought upriver to Sippar, and then injected into the overland routes heading toward Mari or Assyria.

# The Kingdom of Mari River Network

Situated on the Middle Euphrates in modern-day Syria near Abu Kamal, the Kingdom of Mari did not produce the commodities that fuelled the Bronze Age economy. Instead, it grew fabulously wealthy by controlling a ‘choke point’ through which all caravans had to pass if they were trading in the area.

# The Choke Point

To understand Mari’s power, one must look at a map. To move goods between the Mediterranean Sea and Mesopotamia, there were only two realistic options.

**The Desert Route** was a perilous, waterless trek across the Syrian steppe, infested with bandits and nomadic tribes.

**The River Route** followed the curve of the Euphrates River, which offered water, fodder for donkeys, and fortified stops.

Mari sat on a strategic bend of the Euphrates. It controlled the ""junction"" where the river road met the desert tracks leading west to the Levant and the Mediterranean coast.

# The Miksum Economy

Unlike the Assyrians, who were venture capitalists risking their own money, the Kings of Mari built their economy on the **Miksum**, a mandatory customs duty or toll levied on every boat and caravan that passed through their territory.

The Kingdom maintained a string of fortresses along the river. Officials known as *sugāgū* (local headmen) and *merhū* (overseers of the pasture) acted as customs officers.

The standard tax was roughly 10% of the cargo’s value, often payable in kind. If you were shipping 10 jars of Cretan wine to Babylon, Mari kept one.

In exchange for the *miksum*, the Palace of Mari provided a *tebibtum*, a clearance document that proved the tax was paid and guaranteed royal protection against local raiders.

# The ""Tin Road"" and the ""Wine Road""

Mari was the pivot point for a massive east-west exchange. The archives reveal a clear directional flow of commodities.

**Westbound Traffic (The Tin Road)**

The most critical strategic resource, tin, came from the east, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan. It flowed through Babylon, up the river to Mari, and then out to the West.

The tin was destined for the powerful kingdoms of **Aleppo (Yamhad)**, **Qatna**, and the port city of **Ugarit**.

Tablets from Mari mention tin being shipped to ""Kaptara"" (Crete). The bronze weapons of the Minoan civilisation relied on tin that had passed through the toll-gates of Mari.

**Eastbound Traffic (The Wine Road)**

Mesopotamia was a land of beer, grapevines and olive trees did not grow easily. The Levant however, was the land of wine and olive oil.

Huge quantities of high-quality wine (*karānum*), olive oil, cedar wood, and aromatic resins flowed downriver from Mari to the markets of Babylon and Larsa.

**Administration**

We know more about Mari than almost any other Bronze Age city because of the discovery of its **Royal Archives**—over 25,000 tablets found in the palace of its last king, **Zimri-Lim** (c. 1775–1761 BC).

These letters reveal a King who acted less like a warrior and more like a Logistics Manager.

For instance, Zimri-Lim personally approved the movement of ice that was harvested from mountains to cool royal drinks, the breeding of lions for hunts, and the specific exchange rates for silver.

The archives distinguish between ""commercial trade"" which was taxed, and diplomatic ""gift exchange"", that was not taxed. Kings would send ""presents"" to avoid taxes, but the other King would tally the value and expect a ""present"" of exactly equal value in return. It was trade disguised as friendship.

# The End of the Road

The River Network was dismantled by the same man who disrupted the Northern Network,  **Hammurabi of Babylon**.

Initially an ally of Mari, Hammurabi grew tired of paying tolls to his northern neighbour. In roughly **1761 BC**, after consolidating power in the south, he turned his armies north.

Hammurabi conquered Mari, looted the palace, and burned it to the ground. The fire baked the clay tablets of the Royal Archive, preserving the history of the river trade forever.

With Mari destroyed, Babylon became the sole master of the Euphrates, but the delicate balance of the ""middleman"" trade was broken. The centre of gravity shifted, contributing to the general economic contraction of the 1700s BC.

1pw015a,https://www.reddit.com/r/scubaindia/comments/1pw015a/travelogue_two_week_diving_holiday_with_dive/,Travelogue: Two Week Diving Holiday with Dive India in Andamans,"I have been diving for over 10 years now and with over 345 dives across the world, I had yet to dive in India. However, a US trip earlier in the year meant a lot of new dive equipment including my first BP&W set-up and a new regulator as well. So I decided to dive in a relatively calm dive destination and decided to head to Andaman Islands. Given Dive India's reputation and since I had interacted with the team a couple of times at the Mumbai shop to get gear, I decided to go with Dive India. They were fast and responsive with the arrangements so that also was very reassuring and also offered a good package price given that I was diving for 10 days atleast with them across Neil and Havelock.

**Travel**

Since the trip was last minute, the cost of flights to Andaman was quite high, I used an Air India voucher to fly to Kolkata and then do a 8 hour layover in Kolkata before heading to Port Blair aboard an Air India Express flight. The journey to Kolkata was super smooth but once I reached Kolkata, I realised how bad the airport is for transit. There are hardly any places to rest, no good food options and even very few charging ports. I was booked on separate PNRs so I had to wait in the departures hall to again check-in my luggage but seriously, this airport needs an upgrade and now. Of course, post check-in which opened 3 hours before my flight, the area after security is better but since this was one of the first domestic flights of the day, the airport was still sleeping with hardly any F&B outlets open. Thankfully the flight was empty and I could stretch out and sleep all the way through to Port Blair. Dive India's appointed driver was at the airport and we went to a restaurant for a much needed breakfast of dosas and coffee before heading to the Government Ferry Terminal for another 2 hour wait. The Government Ferry is half the cost of the private ferry and air conditioned as well, the only challenge is that you need to carry your luggage inside so would not advise it if you are old or mobility challenged but otherwise its a great option. It also sways side to side instead of the forward backward motion of the private ferries. The side to side motion  is far less likely to cause sea-sickness. I experienced the difference since my return ferry from Havelock to Port blair was a private one and while faster and with more amenities was far less comfortable with people vomiting up and down the cabin since the sea was a bit rough. Not the most pleasant experience for sure. Next time, it's going to be Government ferries all the way.

Stop 1: Neil Island

Dive India is one of the original dive centres on this small but beautiful island and is located just 2 minutes from the ferry jetty. A really nicely done up and recently updated dive centre and resort (now called DiveResort now instead of the earlier and in my view nicer name of Dancing Dugong). The DiveResort is quite charming with very comfortable rooms, a nice restaurant to lounge or hang around in and has some fun games etc to while away the evenings. Do note internet is a bit slow but manageable. The team is very friendly and do their best to take care of the guests. Due to the typhoon/cyclonic weather, we were unfortunately very restricted in terms of the sites where I could go and dive and often many of the dives were early in the morning but the sites I did see were not bad at all and easily comparable to the kind of diving in Thailand or Vietnam or even peninsular Malaysia. Lots of reef fish, sea snakes and quite a few barracudas and octopus. Unfortunately, you cannot do night diving in Neil Island so evenings are a good time to explore the island by renting a bicycle or a two wheeler to visit different beaches. You will not find any fancy cafes etc on the island. The food is basic but quite good to taste. It does not feel touristy like Havelock does and that's a good thing in my view. The DiveResort does not have liquor so you will need to go out to buy a beer for the evenings but that's a minor inconvenience since everything is nearby. The only thing I would add is that the cost of ordering ready made tea is a bit high, luckily I had carried my own 3-in-1 tea sachets but c'mon tea is the joy of travelling in India. Do note there are 3-4 resident dogs in the DiveResort who are very friendly but if you are scared of dogs, you may want to think again about staying here.

Stop 2: Havelock Island

The journey from Neil to Havelock takes just over an hour on the Government Ferry.

Dive India is located on Gobind Nagar beach on Havelock on the grounds of another resort called White Sands. The Dive operation is flawlessly run with really friendly dive crew, guides and staff. The internet is a bit iffy but you can make do unless you have video calls since for me this was a workcation so that was a bit difficult sometimes. Unfortunately the bad weather followed me here as well so I could not really do the well-known sites on Havelock but the diving I did see was not too bad (avoid the shallow sites which are dull) and I would definitely visit again to see the deeper and more well-known sites. I did do 3 night dives on Nemo's Reef which was awesome and lots of little critters to see including my favourite - The Frogfish and some awesome decorator crabs. Be warned the mosquitoes are a menace and remember to carry some repellant spray otherwise they will bite you through your clothes and even wetsuits. The Full Moon Cafe is just next to the Dive India centre and has some amazing food (no alcohol though). Overall had a good time, saw some nice reefs, good coral gardens and many many reef fish. I will definitely visit again in better weather.

And all too soon, it was time to leave, this time on the private ferry to Port Blair. While the ferry has all amenities, you cannot take any bag except a backpack or a purse into the cabin. So if you have any camera gear, laptops etc you will need to either pack it carefully or separate it before checking in. The catamaran is quite comfy to look at and has a nice bar but the up and down motion was fun when the ride started but by the time to ride ended, many many of the passengers were green and sea-sick. This could be a factor of rough seas during the time I traveled but frankly I preferred the slower government ferry. ",1,1766740102.0,scubaindia,0,1.0,False

1pvzyon,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1pvzyon/honeymoon_in_thailand_our_itinerary_and_experience/,Honeymoon in Thailand - Our Itinerary and Experience,"Hi all,

Just got back to California after spending 2 weeks in Thailand for our honeymoon. Just wanted to give thanks to this subreddit, as we did a lot of research before hand to build our itinerary. I think the biggest thing to take away is that it all makes sense once you’re here, and that no matter what you do you have to keep the plan flexible.

Here’s our itinerary in case it helps others, happy to answer any questions.

Bangkok - 3 Nights
- Stayed in Khlong Toei, at a hotel on Sukhumvit 24 since we had a friend who lived near there.
- Otherwise a fine area but the the main road is pretty wild walk itself and super busy. But lots of bars and rooftop bars nearby and the metro line connects around there.
- Did all the touristy things, like a city tuk tuk tour, song wat road, khao san road, ICONSIAM, and soi cowboy to see the craziness.
- Biggest thing thing that stood out was the traffic. The traffic was no joke and makes LA seem like a cake walk. Fastest transportation is definitely on a grab bike but is not for the faint of heart especially with heavy traffic.

Chiang Mai - 3 Nights
- Stayed in charming 3 star hotel in Old Town Chiang Mai.
- Sunday Night Market is awesome, probably the largest night market I’ve experienced in terms of walking distance and options. Our only regret is not buying more things as it was the cheapest touristy items you can find anywhere else in the country.
- Old Town is very walkable and has so many cool coffee shops and art shops you can find and explore, on top of all the temples. Same for some of the charming bars with live music.
- We did the a morning sunrise view of Doi Suthep and the temples, and an all day Elephant Sanctuary and Doi Inthanon tour.
- Honestly we really liked Chiang Mai, maybe it was the complete opposite of the business of Bangkok that was refreshing.
- 3 Nights Days felt long enough, could have cut out the Doi Inthanon part of the tour but it was included with the elephant sanctuary we booked.

Koh Samui - 3 Nights
- This is where we splurged a but for the rest of our trip, we stayed at Silavadee resort near Lamai. Really great resort, with an awesome breakfast buffet/menu.
- Lamai Beach was very nice and not very busy. The main road is a good mix of different restaurants and bars.
- Did a tour up to Pig Island and Koh Tan. Really fun tour and snorkeling.
- Did a night out to Chaweng, which is what you expect but the beach clubs were not as fun as we expected. Honestly had way more fun at the bars with live music, there were two bars with exceptional live bands performing.
- Honestly there was still so much more we could have done on Koh Samui, honestly 4 nights here seems like the best bet at minimum.

Kata Noi, Phuket - 4 Nights
- We also splurged here for our honeymoon and stayed at The Shore in Kata Noi. We realized here is that Katathani, which the Shore is part of, basically owns most of the property around Kata Noi, and looks like they’re expanding and building two new hotels as well. 
- This definitely felt more like a traditional resort feel, as Kata Noi is a small beach but a lot more calmer and family friendly because of the families staying at Katathani hotels.
- Kata Noi beach itself is so pleasant and relaxing. We went up to Kata Beach over the hill to check it out but this is where we really encountered all the more annoying tourists as others have mentioned. Much busier beach and we ended up just going back to Kata Noi because it was less crowded.
- Old Phuket Town is awesome as well, gave us a similar vibe as Chiang Mai, and a fun morning/afternoon to spend and also do some shopping for gifts.
- Around Kata Noi and Kata further up into the hills are a few day/night clubs/bars we checked out as well like Fire and Tree Bay. More traditional club/beach/outdoor bar feel but with more expensive prices. It’s whether you prefer enjoying the sunset on the beach or with a cool view and a cocktail.
- We also went to Bangla Road/Pa Tong one night just to check it off our list. Club entries overpriced, and of course street was as advertised.  We didn’t stay more than 1.5 hours before heading back.

Bangkok - 1 Night
- One last night in Bangkok before heading back. Which we spent going to a few trendier bars and rooftops, and a nicer dinner to wrap up our honeymoon.

Overall, we feel like we knocked out everything we aimed to do. We feel like depending on what you’re aiming to get you can kind of shift days from Bangkok or Chiang Mai if you want to get more island/beach days. But we hope to come back to Thailand in the future and explore other islands and places.",6,1766739829.0,ThailandTourism,0,1.0,False

I’m currently travelling to Thailand from Vietnam. I have this weird hobby of collecting newspapers. 

I love reading them, I love them as a concept (especially in today’s age), and I try to collect them from various countries I travel to or my friends/family travel. 

While leaving Vietnam, I could not find a newspaper from there, but I think I will be able to find it in Bangkok through some places i found on Google. 


My question is, would you know of any place that might sell newspapers of multiple countries or maybe someone runs a weird collection of newspapers that you might know.

Would greatly appreciate the help. Beer/coffee whatever on me if you’re able to help out. The business class lounge was adamant about not giving out a single newspaper to economy passenger. Which is understandable but still, help out a fellow human sometimes 🤷🏻‍♂️.  They were still very polite and nice so no qualms.

On the 22nd, she started moaning about our choice of restaurant and walked away crying and shouting. Then when we sat down to eat, she came and moaned and shouted at us for getting a table for 2 not 3 and stormed off again. Then moaned about being alone in a foreign country. She gave 3 totally different excuses for this.

24th she was complaining about it not ""feeling christmasey"". I had just finished working from home and it was still afternoon. I walked away to breathe and went to a coffee shop just 5 mins away. She's staying in a hotel not far from our apartment.

She rang me 7 times screaming at me saying I left her in a foreign country all alone again (I was on the same street, just a few hundred metres away. At this point I turned my phone off. She claims to have rang me 7 times because she didn't know if the call went through (I answered, heard a raised voice and put it in my pocket) due to the foreign dialing tone. She then rang my Girlfriend screaming at her until midnight (this is the 2nd time they met btw). My GF put the phone to the side and we ate pizza. She was still screaming down the other end at nobody. Nobody responded to her on the phone call. She spent 45 mins shouting and swearing at thin air.

25th both me and my GF woke up to a dozen messages each accusing us of abusing her. I rang my Gran and Aunt to speak to her....she then gave me grief for doing that. She later said that I am ""dead to her"". I couldn't deal with her anger so just turned my phone off all day.

Its now the 26th and she is still sending messages accusing me of abusing her and leaving her. She claims that I've made her suicidal.

I genuinely couldn't cope anymore. She has a history of screaming at people and saying horrible things. I just wanted a nice Xmas.

Now I'm being made to feel guilty by the family for not wanting to spend time with the person who has done nothing but scream over the course of 3 days.",3,1766739466.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I was thinking about my childhood recently and maybe I found source of my procrastination later in life, so I would like to hear your opinions. I had problems with procrastination since middle school. To the point I would not make homework until already in class and teacher starts collecting notes, or I would make shit up while being asked. And still, I had no problems understanding program and getting good enough grades and passing tests so no one batched an eye.

It is in university when things became worse. Because now I couldn’t make 1 month assignments in one night. But I still tried. As a result academic debts and sleep deprivation would accumulate at the same time I couldn’t understand why is it much easier for my peers to “Just do it”TM. As a result, I had to take a year off from university and retake some classes. In the end I finished uni, mainly because I discovered for myself the power of coffee.

And now to the point. Back in school I had a Xbox 360. However, my parents forbid me from playing it on weekdays. It may sound okay but now I think it conditioned me to be a procrastinator. Here is how. My usual weekday was school -> lunch at home -> hockey practice -> back at home at 7-8 pm. -> Do homework for the next day. -> sleep -> repeat. Sometimes I was tired after hockey so I had hard time doing homework, but still I had nothing else to do, except go to bed. My mom would often nag me, I should do homework at the weekends so, I would have more free time after trainings. But now, I am asking you, why would I do that. Weekends are the only days I can play vidiya. It is the only time I am actually free. Why would I spend this golden time doing something else just to have a few hours garbage free time on Tuesday before bed. And now it haunts me. I have this hyper fixation on my free time, like it is the most valuable thing in the world. And I am not talking about time to play games, but just the time I could spend doing whatever. So now I am looking at things in a way to maximise my free indoor time. Even if it is not doing important stuff. What are your thoughts?

TLDR: In middle-high school I had busy schedule. And I was forbidden from playing vidiya on weekdays. So why would I spend my precious weekends doing homework if it is only time I am free to do whatever. To this day the principle persists. Ay or nay?",1,1766738727.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False
1pvzoa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TugboatMacAbernathey/comments/1pvzoa2/a_mighty_fortress_and_a_very_fat_baby/,A Mighty Fortress and a Very Fat Baby,"Big John was over 11 pounds when he was born. That’s why they called him Big John. He was being baptized late by Lotharite standards, but there were circumstances involved. Well, one circumstance, that being his mother was unable to walk for several months after his birth. But now here he was, being carried to the baptismal font at the First Lotharite Church of New Winnweiler (Heidelberg Confession). Dressed in a custom baptismal gown, you see, as Big John was nearly seventeen pounds… they call him Big John for a reason.

Big John was held by his parents, both lifelong Lotharites. The pastor dressed in a robe and stole poured water over the crown of Big John’s head three times, baptizing him in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was no applause, the baby’s head was patted dry and he was about to be carried away so that the service could proceed with scripture reading.

But then it happened.

No one quite understood what was going on as a booming voice rang out “Una forte Rocca e il nostro Dio!” Big John sang in perfect pitch, in the voice of a tenor, in precise Italian. The congregation looked around for speakers, for someone with a microphone. As Big John continued the hymn, the ears of the congregants led their eyes to the baby at the baptismal, who was in fact belting out the Lotharite anthem. There were gasps, shouts of praise which were more common among other types of Protestants, and the grinding of teeth. Well, there was just one person grinding her teeth. But who could be bothered by this sudden outpouring of miraculous talent?

Lauren Stromberg. That’s who.

Lauren Stromberg was a joy to be around. Tall, physically imposing, severe; she directed the choir of the First Lotharite Church of New Winnweiler (Heidelberg Confession) like a drill sergeant. Big John’s voice was simply amazing, but Lauren immediately identified several problems: there were no hymns during a baptism, spontaneity was simply out of the question, and that sounds like… Italian? Too exotic for a Lotharite (Heidelberg Confession) service.

“Il regno suo rimane per l’eternita” Big John held the ending note to the hymn in a bold display of lung capacity. The stunned crowd, some standing, some having fainted, were held in a breathless pause for a brief moment after Big John had concluded the one-song performance. But then they erupted in ecstatic applause. Well, not quite everyone. Actually, everyone except one person.

Lauren Stromberg.

The pastor announced an unscheduled intermission to the service so that everyone could regain their composure. What a buzz the crowd, mostly older folks, were in!

“He must be the reincarnation of Pavarotti!” Lauren heard one woman say.

“What a beautiful language! Why don’t we sing in Italian more often?” Said another. Lauren’s eye twitched when her brain registered that one.

“The miracle of tongues!” Suggested someone else. Oh boy, someone was in need of a reminder of Maxmillian Lothar’s teachings on the acts of the Apostles, and how they had ceased in the first century. It’s in the Heidelberg Confession.

A hurried service resumed after a few minutes, the pastor referring to the impromptu song from a 58-day old child as a “miracle” definitely ground Lauren’s gears. She was stoic as she directed the choir through a well-rehearsed closing hymn. A watchful eye on Big John, who had fallen asleep in his car seat, half-expecting another disturbance during the approved, English-language hymn. Despite the chaotic energy delivered by Big John, the hymn went as planned.

As you may imagine, everyone wanted to see Big John after the service. To quiz his parents, who were as in awe of the event as anyone else, to see him, to touch his little, well… it’s a relative term, hand. Lauren Stromberg intercepted the pastor as he was on his way to see if he could score an audience with Big John.

“Pastor Ludendorfer.” She halted him. “I think it’s appropriate for you to issue a correction to the congregation.

The pastor was accustomed to being stopped by a congregant while he was walking, but this bold interception irked him. He composed himself, masking his frustration as best he could. He wanted to gawk at Big John with everyone else, not pacify Lauren Stromberg in whatever nitpicky complaint she had.

“Thanks for bringing it to my attention. A correction about what though?”

“People are saying that the interrupting, I mean singing, baby, is the reincarnation of some opera singer. Maxmillian Lothar taught quite clearly that reincarnation was incompatible with reformed faith. The Heidelberg Confession clearly outlines”

Pastor Ludendorfer raised his hand and nodded in acknowledgment.

“Yes, I understand. That teaching is very clear. I think sometimes when people are excited they speak without thinking. Whoever said that probably meant that Big John sounded like an opera singer. He does though! Wasn’t that amazing? I have never heard anything like that! He sang like an angel!”

Lauren glared at him, making several mental notes.

“It wasn’t one person; it was several people. I think it requires correction.” She insisted, physically barring Pastor Ludendorfer from passing. She only permitted him to access Big John, who he had to chase (which was easy, Big John didn’t even crawl yet, but his stroller did move quickly), after he had acquiesced to her stern demand masked as a suggestion.

The usual crowd was on time for church the following Sunday. This was not unusual as they were mostly retirees (they were Lotharites after all, I think the average age of the congregation was late sixties). Most were still unhappy with the recent change to a 9 am service, they preferred the original 7:30 start time. Some grumbled that the young Pastor Ludendorfer was being influenced by Pentecostals with the late service. Anyway, the point here is that they were extra motivated to be on time to see if Big John would return this Sunday with his parents. He did. Everyone was so excited to see Big John being strolled in, well almost everyone. Actually only one person wasn’t excited to see Big John.

Lauren Stromberg was not excited to see Big John.

She rolled her eyes so hard that a weaker woman would have hurt her neck. But Lauren was a powerlifter, her squat game was a little weak though. She snapped the choir to attention and began directing them in the opening hymn at exactly 9 o’clock. They had finished the first verse, but the crowd was looking to the back pew, eyes fixed on Big John.

This was going too well, Lauren knew it was too early to relax. As the second verse began, the choir was overpowered by a familiar voice, louder than the choir with all their powers combined.

“Santo, santo, santo! Tutti i santi t’adorano,

deponendo le corone davanti al trono tuo”

Big John sang as beautifully, and as Italian as he had the week before.

The crowd gasped, the choir stopped, Big John continued.

Lauren snapped.

She rapped her conductor’s baton on the music stand and commanded them to begin on the chorus. A few complied, the others stood marveling at Big John’s holy serenade. The organ continued playing, well, organ sounds continued. The congregation did not have an organist, not since Mrs. Gewurztraminer had moved to an assisted living facility last year. The musical accompaniment to the hymn was played from a popular video sharing application.

There was applause when the song ended. There was never applause after a hymn, well, unless Big John just sang it, in Italian.

Boy was this a great introduction to Pastor Ludendorfer’s ten-minute sermon.

“What a wonderful gift we’ve been given, to hear this little one praise the name of our Lord with his beautiful voice. But in our joy, we must be careful to speak the truth. We’re called to remember the clear teachings of scripture, clarified by Maxmillian Lothar, and codified in the Heidelberg Confession. A soul exists in Earth once before judgement. The idea that the soul of anyone who has passed into eternity could come back into a different body is well outside our understanding of the afterlife as outlined in the Heidelberg Confession… and scripture.”

The time for the closing hymn approached. Lauren held out her hand, stopping the choir from approaching. The congregation was confused, there was nothing in the Heidelberg Confession about this.

“There is no need to follow centuries of order and tradition, the little newcomer will just sing for us.”

A cascading gasp spread through the crowd in reaction. Some looked at Lauren in disbelief, others looked back at Big John in anticipation of his next lovely song. Pastor Ludendorfer, with a still-active lapel microphone (and boy was he aware of that since the “burp incident” of 2023), interrupted.

“Choir, could we please have you come to the chancel for the closing hymn?”

They reluctantly resumed their progress. Lauren glared at Ludendorfer furiously. He meekly avoided her intense glare and felt genuine fear.

The organ was a bit delayed in starting, but after it began (well, after someone hit the play button on their phone app) the choir was immediately overpowered by little baby Pavarotti in the back of the church.

“Incoroniamo di corone,
L’Agnel sul Suo splendor!”

The congregation sighed with relief, the choir provided an English backing to the hymn, Lauren stormed out.

No one really noticed her leaving, though she marched down the center aisle and out the main door.

After the congregation was dismissed, they gathered around and fawned over Big John much as before. Pastor Ludendorfer patiently waited for an audience with the silent infant, though his joy was stolen by the looming threat of Lauren Stromberg, with whom he knew an unavoidable encounter loomed.

Michael Wolfgang Ludendorfer snuck out of the church with the main body of departees, highly irregular. He normally listened to the elderly, who were his primary audience, tell him about their prescription medication after a Sunday morning service; but today, he was fleeing from his choir director.

Her car was still in the parking lot! In a mild panic, he hurried to his own car and fled the parking lot while the church was still half full, or half empty, depending on your perspective.

Lauren was already down the road, only a few hundred yards away at the historic Saint Jakob Railroad Park. It consisted of two benches, a tree, and a decommissioned railroad bridge that spanned 38 feet across the Alsenbach Creek. For over seventy years it was used to supply the mill which had polluted the creek, which tragically caught on fire in 1966. The creek caught on fire, not the mill.

Become a member
Anyway, the cruel November wind blew wisps of Lauren’s hair from her orderly braid as she looked through the dead shrubbery of the embankment down at the barely moving water of the famed creek. She stood in solemn, silent contemplation at the foot of the bridge. Her life’s work had been overshadowed by a spectacle… in Italian no less.

Lost in thought, her situational awareness was also lost.

“You okay there Miss?”

She gasped, spinning around startled to see a sharply dressed gentleman standing a respectful distance away.

Lauren didn’t recognize the man, which was odd for New Winnweiler. Even if she didn’t know someone, she typically at least recognized them. Perhaps he was a visitor and had just come from church. Maybe he saw her leave and followed. That made sense to Lauren.

She took a deep breathe to compose herself. Her cheeks and nose were red from the cold, but she hadn’t shown any indication that she had been crying, because she hadn’t been.

“Yes. I’m fine.”

“It’s not a very high bridge, you know.”

Lauren’s face betrayed her internal reaction, even if her words were measured.

“It was high enough to get corn to the mill for over 70 years.”

The stranger sucked in his lips and nodded, looking past her at the bridge.

“Sure was, but it’s not for corn anymore. I don’t think it’s high enough for much else though.”

“What are you implying?!” Lauren sharply responded, alarmed at the inference.

The man held his palms up toward her as if to deescalate.

“Just thought I’d check and see if you were alright. It’s not too common to see a lady in her Sunday best on a bridge staring at the creek.”

Lauren knew that the stranger knew, her eyes downcast as she deliberated whether or not to tell this seemingly kind person her troubles.

“It’s that singing baby, isn’t it?” He asked.

“I was hoping it was my imagination. But that fat baby really does interrupt the service, doesn’t he?” Lauren blurted, seeking validation. He must have seen her leave the service, she told herself.

“I can help you with the baby.” The stranger said, taking a step forward.

Lauren’s head tilted, warily eying the man and instinctively putting her hand on the pepper spray bottle in her pocket. Lauren pepper-sprayed someone at least once a month.

“I can elevate your choir. I can silence the baby. I can even help you to out-sing that baby. In Italian, heck, even Latin if you”

Lauren’s eye twitched at the suggestion she sing in Italian, and Latin was the final straw.

“We must avoid and shun all idolatry, sorcery, superstitious rites, and invoke the one true God only!”

She quoted the Heidelberg Confession. And that serpent of old, Satan, the Devil, was overcome.

Well, either that or the blast of pepper spray that Lauren delivered to his eyeballs from inches away. He held his jacket over his eyes as he fled blindly into traffic to be hit by a freelance delivery driver. Lauren was in hot pursuit but veered away as the stranger lay mangled in the street and jogged lightly to her car in the church parking lot.

I am going to out-sing that fat baby. Lauren thought to herself, dabbing her forehead with a napkin as she sat in her car. She grabbed a fresh bottle of pepper spray from the glove box and replaced the used can in her pocket.

Pastor Ludendorfer’s heart skipped a beat the next morning when he arrived at the First Lotharite Church of New Winnweiler (Heidelberg Confession) and saw Lauren Stromberg’s car in the parking lot.

He spoke the words of Maxmillian Lothar aloud, but quietly as he exited his vehicle and walked, slowly, to the church.

“Dear God,

Protect me from sin, error, and unsolicited theological corrections.

Grant me the swiftness outlined in the Heidelberg Confession Article 17, Note B,

where it says to flee evil swiftly,

Guard my tongue,

strengthen my spine,

and conceal me if possible.

Amen.”

An angelic voice greeted him from the sanctuary as he entered. Lauren Stromberg was in front of the chancel, where she was accustomed to directing the choir from, singing beautifully. Maybe not quite as beautifully as Big John, but quite nicely at least.

Pastor Ludendorfer chose wisely to not interrupt Lauren’s solitary practice and went about his normal Monday morning business.

Lauren trained like a Navy SEAL… of singing, all week. Each day her voice grew shakier, more hoarse. But she refused to coddle her vocal cords. She would defeat Big John fair and square, or she would die trying.

She barely slept Saturday night, and rather than fighting vainly against consciousness, she rose early and prepared herself for battle.

“Rrrrrroll your Rrrrrrs for the Lorrrrrrd!” She woke her tired vocal cords, compressing her sore diaphragm with her fists. She was as ready as she ever would be.

The first at church, she analyzed the acoustics from her position against those of where the fat baby sat with his parents. Too bad Lotharites don’t believe in church nurseries, she thought, this could have all been avoided. But Lauren was never one to back down from a fight, not even a fight with a fat baby.

It was 8:58 am when Big John’s parents strolled into church. So much for the virtue of punctuality extolled in the Heidelberg Confession. Lauren had already been there for hours, to the prepared goes the glory, that’s what Maxmillian Lothar had said.

The organ music announcing the opening verse Be Still My Soul. All eyes turned to Big John, who was sitting smugly, according to Lauren, in the back pew with his parents and their contraband coffee.

Lauren unveiled her secret weapon. No, not pepper spray, although she had considered it. A microphone, which she held to her mouth and sang into, competing with but not overpowering Big John as he began singing.

“Sii calma, o cuor,

confida nel Signor”

Many, but not all, eyes turned to Lauren, who had never before used a microphone while directing the choir. Lauren’s voice cracked, then it squeaked. She threw the microphone down with a horrible amplified crashing noise as Big John continued the hymn. She ran, undignified, unlike the week before, through the crowded church, pepper spraying Michael Wolfgang Ludendorfer in the eyes with alarming precision as she ran from the church straight to the historic Saint Jakob Railroad Park. Steam escaping her mouth in the cold morning air, still over Alsenbach Creek, as she gazed down to the water which seemed to call to her.

The Sun broke through the dark clouds, and she felt like it was shining just on her as a warm gust blew up the embankment from under the bridge.

I‘m lactose intolerant and allergic to milk but never had any severe acute symptoms other than a slight stomach issue, all the years I damaged my gut probably drinking diary. 2021 I cut off Diary but ofcourse that’s not enough to get back a healthy gut. 

I always tried to follow the Gaps protocol but to be honest it’s quite rigorous as many know. So since a few months I’ve cut gluten, no diary, No artificial stuff and no sugar (Maybe once a week a very small amount).

I do drink very very light coffee with very little oatmilk.

Does anyone know what low secrotoric IgA mean. Yeah maybe I should just do more googling.

First up - know your real schedule. Like, actually track yourself for a few days. When do you really focus best? Build around those natural rhythms instead of some fantasy version of yourself. Trust me, this changes everything.

Also, leave some breathing room! Schedule at like 70-80% capacity max. Having buffer time isn't being lazy - it's just smart planning because life happens, right? And while we're at it, match your energy to your tasks. Tackle the hard stuff when you're sharp, save the easy review for when you're basically running on coffee fumes.

Here's a trick for the perfectionists out there - time-box everything. Give yourself 30 minutes for essay planning, 45 for rewriting notes, whatever. Those limits actually help you focus instead of spending three hours color-coding your flashcards.

Want to actually stick with it? Start small. First week of January, maybe just schedule three main subjects with one session each. Success builds momentum. Oh, and use time-blocking - instead of writing ""Study Chemistry"" on your list, make it ""Chemistry problems: Tuesday 2-4 PM."" When you give stuff a specific time slot, it actually happens.

The best part? When you assign specific times for studying, you also know when you're NOT studying. Hello, guilt-free relaxation during the holidays!",2,1766738271.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

So, I’ve been on a higher protein routine lately (to get more shredded), and I keep buying coffee-flavoured whey only…cause me and my girlfriend we are hardcore caffeine addicts 😁

Honestly, MB has done exceptional with their blue tokai coffee blend in terms of taste, mixability, and digestion. Beats ATOM Cafe Latte and Nakpro Gold Whey (coffee) both.

It has that roasted notes closely similar to imported coffee beans type... not overly sweet, and a veryy smooth mouthfeel. Also, mixes well in water and milk..and touchwood…I haven't felt any bloating till date in my last 20 days of use. Probably gonna stick to it for the next few months.

Nakpro Coffee is not horrible, but it feels more like plain whey with a light coffee hint. Texture can be a bit powdery, and the flavour is flatter, especially in water and idk why but it formed foams. Occasionally felt bloated too during this time. 

ATOM cost is less, does the job…but the mixability is not good even after 15 secs of vigorous shaking.  In milk it’s better, but still feels kind of flat and had a syrupy aftertaste now that I've tasted MB…not real real coffee like (coffee drinkers will know).

If I were to rank my overall experience I'd say **MB is 4.5** out of 5, **Nakpro is 3.6ish** and **ATOM is 3**.

I’m on the hunt for good quality coffee grounds available in Bangladesh, both offline (local shops/markets) and online stores. I’m interested in everything from medium roast everyday beans to specialty/third-wave stuff — ideally fresh, aromatic, and worth the price!
What I’m Looking For
Great flavor and aroma
Fresh grind (or beans you can grind yourself)
Easy to find locally around Dhaka (or Bangladesh generally)
Online options that deliver in BD
Price-to-quality balance
Offline (In-Store) Suggestions
If you’ve seen good coffee grounds at:
Supermarkets (e.g., Agora, Meena Bazar)
Specialty cafes or coffee shops (places that sell beans/grounds to take home)
Local roasters
Please mention: ✅ Brand/roaster name
✅ Where you bought it
✅ Rough price
Online Options (BD)
If you’ve ordered coffee grounds online:
Which platform? (Daraz, Chaldal, ShopUp, direct shop site, etc.)
Freshness / roast info
Shipping experience
Extras
Also open to suggestions like: ⭐ Best for espresso vs filter/press
⭐ Dark vs medium vs light roasts
⭐ Whole beans to grind at home
Thanks in advance! Happy to try any recommendations and report back ☕🔥",2,1766737306.0,Dhaka,4,1.0,False

I've narrowed it down to 3 choices that I'd be happy with but I don't know nearly enough about espresso machines to know which one is the best. My options are the Breville Barista Express Coffee Machine BES870BSS - Breville Ex Impress Coffee Machine BES876BTR - DeLonghi La Specialista Opera Coffee Machine Black EC9555BK. All advice is welcome.

I only plan on making Lattes, Cappuccinos and Mochaccinos. My palate is certainly not fancy enough to tolerate straight espresso.",1,1766737126.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

**PLEASE let me know if I’m being crazy** 🙃:

I (39f) was proposed to by a friend of a friend (39m) 20 years ago. Strange yes, but we found each other interesting and attractive, but I was still with my dopey highschool boyfriend and didn’t know how to set boundaries at that age.

Before this guy left for the military, he asked me to marry him and move to HI for a few years. Unfortunately he did this over the phone and that dopey boyfriend and 2 other drunk boys heard. He was surprised and defensive to their laughter and comments and ended the call.

We never spoke again. He married, deployed and had a kid. I moved abroad for 15 years. Our paths crossed 8 years ago in our home town and he stopped and said “woah hey“, but I just smiled and said ""hi“ and kept walking with my group. I didn’t want to show my shock, figured he‘s married and probably has bad feelings toward me.

Turns out he’s been divorced for a long time. She’s remarried. All living in our old area.

I’m moving back home in a few months and am thinking of reaching out to ask if he wants to catch up over a drink or coffee. I would apologize if he does actually hate me for that proposal scene, but ideally I’d like to see if anything is still there.

Am I being delusional? I’ve recently thrown a lot of caution to the wind after losing a close family member, but I don’t want to be completely reckless 🤡🙈",7,1766737058.0,datingoverforty,27,0.82,False

Oooookay, nightshift misfits, lean in—Jack Slagg back at the mic, knuckles cracked, coffee cold, soul still warm. We’re running it back, same ritual, fresh name carved into the broadcast wood.

u/upset-ratio502.
Yeah, you heard that right. [reverb] Not a summons. Not a trapdoor. Just a clean, consent-first knock on the studio door.

Here’s the pitch, no fine print:

A voluntary interview.

You control the lanes, the depth, the exits.

We talk shop, life, chaos, or whatever ghost is rattling the pipes.

You say “stop,” we stop. Like adults. Like pros. Like people who’ve seen the sun come up accidentally.


No pressure. No performative nonsense. If the answer’s no, that’s a full, honored no—gold-embossed, filed, respected. If it’s yes? We cue the music, light the sign, and let the night breathe.

So, on the record—or gloriously off it—
👉 u/upset-ratio502, would you consent to an interview with the Freak?

[long pause… tape hiss… heartbeat bass]
Either way, thanks for being out there. The airwaves notice who’s still awake.
