I'm from NJ/NYC but go to grad school in Switzerland. I'm looking for a long-term friendship. Here are major my interests/hobbies! 

I'm huge into fitness and love lifting, running, tennis, skiing, and golf (was a D1 college athlete + tons of sports in high school)

Fine dining (been to 50+ three Michelin star restaurants)

Traveling (been to 50+ countries and will be on a few trips soon!) 

Learning languages, and I know 5 already! (English, French, German, Monégasque, Luxembourgish) 

Watching sports! (Lakers, Eagles, Devils, Brooklyn Dodgers, UCLA - check out my CFB conferences solution, Man City, KKR, Red Bull F1, Australia Rugby, Alcaraz/Sinner, DeChambeau/Scheffler)

I love the arts and enjoys any type of museum or performance like Broadway shows, ballets, concerts, and I love a great opera! 

I’m also huge into watches, coffee/tea, reading, politics (check out my presidents ranking), economics/finance, religion, cars, fashion, and great wine/spirits. ",1,1733422179.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

1h7fkwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/comments/1h7fkwb/need_lower_budget_gift_ideas_for_dad_m50/,Need lower budget gift ideas for dad (M50),"I've got a tough one. My Dad is that classic type who typically gets anything he needs for himself and asks for nothing. His main gift is just going to be a comically large sack full of 20ish different pounds of coffee..but other than that, I'm lost. I'd really like to get him something else.

Things he doesn't like or do: alcohol, self care (colognes/fashion included), golf/sports, 'things' (he just did a major declutter of his life and I don't want to ruin the progress and get him crap he won't use). He's also a bit of an introverted hermit who doesn't enjoy going out at all. Experiences probably wouldn't work for him, though I've tried in the past. I think it just stresses him out more than anything

He's been a carpenter most of his life, but recently lost his business and doesn't need much in the way of that anymore. He is a fix-it kind of guy, but it looks as if he has every possible tool/storage option he could possibly need. He's a bit of a tech/computer guy but I'm really out of my element in that category. I feel like he either has what he needs, or my budget wouldn't allow for anything quality item that would be of value to him

He's also relatively health-conscious, but isn't huge on supplements/working out or anything of that nature. I just can't give him a food basket full of jerky, chocolate, snacks..etc",1,1733422157.0,GiftIdeas,1,1.0,False

* Bean: Decaf Medium blend (PERC Coffee)

At grind size 15, I get the following results:

* Time: 18 seconds
* Taste: more balanced than the bitter shot, with a slight leaning towards sour. It's not a sour shot by any means. It's more of a bland shot with a slight hint of sourness.

I would expect an 18-second shot at 1:2 ratio to be under-extracted (sour). That seems like a super fast shot to me. Even for the 23-second shot, I would not expect that to be over-extracted. 

Does the time really matter at all? Is the bean the problem? Please no jokes about decaf; I love coffee but I have to restrict caffeine, and James Hoffmann and Lance Hendrik said that decaf is okay ;)

I am planning to get a [Eureka Mignon Specialita](https://www.eureka.co.it/en/products/eureka+1920/mignon+grinders/silent+range/20.aspx) to pair it with our [Sage Bambino Plus](https://www.sageappliances.com/en-gb/product/bes500). The initial plan was to get a better espresso machine but I believe is wiser to put the money on a grinder and upgrade the machine down the road. At the moment i got the [Melitta Molino](https://www.melitta.co.uk/products/accessories/coffee-grinders/melitta-molino-coffee-grinder/) for more than 5 years and is boarder-line average, at best. 

In terms of brewing, we are 50/50 Americano/Pour Over (every now and then i will pull an espresso shot, lets say once every 2-3 weeks or so) so its a major thing to be able to adjust grid settings easily based on the brew method that I will use. Do you thing the Specialita is a good option? and getting a dial like the [ARO Dial](https://aroespresso.com/products/grinder-setting-dial-for-eureka-mignon?srsltid=AfmBOoousrj4xfkY-8skdTfg4dwMc_RLNNtXaZiCvZCkCBiIp2obIgI8) or the [Mignon King Size Grind Dial](https://www.eureka.co.it/en/accessory/id/193.aspx) is an upgrade that will put value on the end result?

I was looking at the [Eureka Mignon Perfetto](https://www.eureka.co.it/en/products/eureka+1920/mignon+grinders/silent+range/21.aspx) as well, but the majority of the reviews are complaining about the dial and the difficulty of going back and forth in grind settings with accuracy for different brewing methods.

Any advice and guidance welcome.

Hi there,
I’m 21 and I got out of a relationship back in January and haven’t talk to any girls in the last 11 months to work on my relationship with God and to not rebound. Only the last few weeks have I been willing to another relationship.

Last week I met this girl online and we hit it off instantly and we have been texting her every day a lot even giving each other morning and night messages. think things are going great, but about 2 days ago I noticed she has been responding a lot slower and not not been texting like she was. She has been struggling at work recently and needs to find a new job and I’ve been giving her some advice since I’ve been through a situation like that. Yesterday she said she appreciates me and called me sweet. We made plans to meetup yesterday for dinner, but she said she didn’t get hardly any sleep and asked to reschedule it till today. I agreed and offered to grab coffee with her this morning. She said had to cancel saying she was exhausted and didn’t get much sleep the night before but asked if we could meetup today. I was fine with that and tried setting up coffee in the morning with her and she couldn’t me a time and was almost dodging the question. I said go ahead and get sleep and when you’re up we can figure it out then. Well it’s now been 14 hours and I still haven’t heard from her. I don’t know if I’ve done something wrong or maybe she’s just busy but I did notice she has been on other social media’s a few time today.

It’s the next day and I thought she would have sent something to me at this point and I still haven’t heard anything from her. Am I overthinking things I like this girls personality and faith and want to see if there maybe is maybe a relationship that blossoms, but I’m not sure at this point if I’m suppose to reach back out her or if I’ve done something wrong and need to move on.

I am starting to get worried and that might be because I have been ghosted by girls and there have been times where I have been stood up. I want to see what happens with this girl, but I don’t want to get my heart like I have in the past.",1,1733421985.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1h7fhzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1h7fhzn/jealous_of_mormons/,Jealous of Mormons ,"So I know this is gonna seem a little out the gate but I lowkey wish I was ex Mormon instead of ex witness. 

As a witness you get fed this idea that your religion is so special but it turns out not only is it not unique, it’s not even the best one in its niche. 

I’m being slightly tongue-in-cheek with this post as I really wish I didn’t have any kind of high control upbringing. 

But it really feels like JWs are just the Temu version of the LDS church. 

Because it’s a bigger religion it also has a bigger “ex” community. There’s a lot more awareness and media about Mormonism and ex Mormon’s. It really feels like Mormonism is the faith that the GB wishes JWs were, especially the financial aspect of it.

I don’t drink alcohol or coffee (by choice) so when new friend learn that and know that I have a religious family they often assume Mormon, when I say JW there’s this reaction of “hmm I don’t really know anything about them”

Hard enough leaving God’s only true organisation that the whole world hates… only to find out worse than being hated, or laughed at, the world actually doesn’t care or even notice and is largely indifferent. 

The only thing special about JWs is how uniquely indifferent the world is towards them. A group whose whole entire shtick is PR and “advertise, advertise, advertise” and yet no one really notices. There’s a unique irony to it all. 

Anyway that’s my gripe about being the poor cult cousin to the r/exmormon community. 

(Said mostly in kind hearted jest with nothing but actual affection for exmormons, any by no means trying to belittle their experience or imply it’s any easier than mine).",4,1733421959.0,exjw,0,1.0,False

This has been a truly terrible fall for me. The job I used to love has been kicking me down a hill, I'm endlessly testing for multiple health diagnoses, and the world is feeling more chaotic and uncaring every day.  I feel so very lucky to have been paired with u/HalfOrcBlushStripe for the exchange. What a funny, caring, and interesting person to get to know! As usual, the exchange organizers made a great match--I was (once again) surprised by how much we had in common. Talking about perfume, our pets, D&D and our jobs was so easy and fun :)

I received my package on November 6th. For my friends in the US, you might understand how getting to unpack and fawn over all these treasures on that Wednesday was an unexpected and incredibly lucky gift during a deeply stressful week. 

[Terribly blurry picture from my very old phone](https://preview.redd.it/e2dpt3rkd25e1.jpg?width=2171&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e6eb8b923a37b60362218cadcef19f765503e68)

Maybe the sweetest part of this packaging were the tiny, individual, handwritten, AGED little notes and scrolls accompanying each item. The wrapping, too, was foresty and earthy and magical. My favorite color is dark green, and each fully gift wrapped box or bag was decorated in tape, leaf stickers, and raffia ribbon.

While we were chatting, HalfOrcBlushStripe mentioned getting into perfumery and the actual creation of scents, and asked if I'd be open to a bespoke scent created by them (!!!). I said yes, but honestly was TERRIFIED it would be bad and I'd have to make the decision whether to tell the truth or not. WORRY NOT, because oh my god is it pretty. I love milky scents--oatmilk, coconut milk, rice milk etc, and this is a creamy, gorgeous, sleepy lavender. I'm so deeply honored that they let me try it out ♡ right now, it's hanging out on my bedside table for when I need something cozy.

I've recently purchased my first espresso machine, the Sage Bambino, and I'm already in love with making coffee at home.

The only thing I'm really missing so far is a grinder and I have been looking at buying a DF54 for a while, which are sold out literally everywhere at the moment. Now I have managed to find a ""brand new"" Timemore 064s grinder on a second hand site, with the receipt, for €20 more than a new DF54 grinder.

Since I have no experience with either, and I'm pretty new to the hobby, I was hoping if you guys could help me out. Is the Timemore 064s better than de DF54, or worth it at all? If not I'll just wait 1,5 month for a DF54. But the 064s for 200 euros below retail price seems like a steal!

I'm planning on using it for mostly espresso.

1h7fgks,https://i.redd.it/fmnqivv5l25e1.jpeg,living alone and not wanting friends,"since i got my apartment and have been living away from my family (only a 10min drive though, i see my sisters weekly) 

I've really grappled with the fact that i just dont have any friends,
and honestly? im totally fine with it. im totally content where i am

but- im not actually. not at all. i feel like a restlessness inside

cause, i FEEL like i should, i feel like im supposed to feel a desire to meet new people.

this feeling like hasnt fkn gone away, its just looming, constantly.

like, yk? in terms of self-improvement;  it stays as a fact in my mind, that, a well-rounded person has a nice big friend group. 
bestiessss aaand ppl to eventually invite to your future wedding. idk.

-

im socially fulfilled, i got a bf, and my sisters, and i get along with all my coworkers, one of em i would even consider to be my friend too but like- theyre my coworker first and we havent hung out outside of work, so like, it doesnt count.

and the thought of going out and meeting new people just stresses me out. like. i would want them to like me and validate me, i dont want to constantly play a game of trying to be likeable. (this is what i appreciate abt being with my sisters.  they like me as i am, theres no trick to it or anything.) and I'd also want to actually be amused and have fun in their presence, like, funny people that have the same humor as me, i find far too many people boring??

unfortunately i feel like gender plays a huge role??? like, so far, i havent found any girls that are my age and not-intimidating and have my sense of humor. not since i was younger (we grew apart) though i hope to.
except for like, i really love my boss, shes funny and we get along, but i am soooo intimidated, i want to do everything i can for her to see me as someone she wants to hangout with,  sometimes we carpool and get coffee though, and i have such a hard time talking about things outside of work..  and in the back of my head, i feel like i really shouldnt bring up work when we're not at work.  lol.  its hard to not be awkward in such instances.  

 anyway. when i get along with guys, there's like. a constant question of ""would we be compatible"" lulling about, hanging in the air, *i* can feel it, /they/ can feel it. its hard to get around it, even, some months ago i unintentionally ruined a long-distance friendship with one of my lifelong friends because we gave into that question and fucked around, and then when i figured out that im not actually attracted to this guy, i just fuckin LOVED talking to him.  i couldnt like, keep talking to him anymore. i mean. lesson learned i guess. 

but then. on top of that. unfortunately. i feel like. when i talk to people i enjoy talking to. it might come off as too-intimate?  I've wondered if this is the reason why i cant seem to maintain friendships with guys without, at some point, learning that they are attracted to me.   (THIS is what i appreciate about my one coworker/friend. since im his coworker/boss, the question of ""are we compatible"" will never arise. and we can just be funny together, with no risk factor)

i feel like, I'll have to wear a freaking ring on my finger before people stop considering me as compatible.

but maybe that wouldnt even work. cos like. cheating is so common now?  i even had some guy try to pick me up a few months ago and when i told him i had a bf he was like, ""but lemme just give u my number, u never know""  like wth? 

OR. MAYBE.  as ive heard from my older sisters; that i really wont need to worry about this stuff once im in my 30s.  because.  its kind of just a young adult thing. where everyone is constantly wondering.  when theyre gonna get their next partner and etcetc.. 

which to that i say, okay, I'd be fine with waiting-  BUT OH NO?  i have read COUNTLESS horror stories about grown adults, regretting not making more friends in their 20s.   and that,   once youre out of school,  its impossible to meet new people and make friends... everyone else has already found families and theyre not gonna be spending their time out and aboug, in a community with new people (such as college) where you might be able to run into eachother.

this thought, absolutely adds to the stress of feeling like i NEED to make friends.

also maybe. i need to go to college? since that is where so many ppl make their life-long friends.

even though, again, im content with where i am, i got a great job and i got a great apt.  all by myself, totally self-reliant,   i love spending my off days (such as today) just, in my apt, doin my own thing, makin art, playing games, daydreaming, music, walks, yummy ass food and my clean lovely space thats, completely predictable, reliable, peaceful and relaxing.  im in great shape and mentally sound too,  why change a thing?

cos in the back of my mind, i fEEL like im suppoooseddd toooo 😵‍💫

well, sometimes actually, lately, ive found a few subjects im interesting in learning more about, so ive been considering attending just a CLASS.  not enrolling in college or anything (cos ngl, seems like more trouble than its worth, idk if I'll really need a bachelor's any time soon. and. theres some stuff im not interested in learning (but is mandatory?) which ik would just stress me out.) but like- just learning, i like learning fs.  certain stuff. whEn it piques my interest.

i guess it would help me meet people lol

/just get out of the house more, i dont friggin do anything outside of work, hang out at my place, hang out at my place wITh my boyfriend, hang out with my sisters and maybe shop but then ultimately end up babysitting, and the eventual walk to the grocery store. 

thats kinda why im writin all this up. i feel a pressure to do something different.

its so hard to not fall into being a lazy POS when you live alone. 

THE END.


ps.  i dont know if i actually am on the spectrum or not.  i dont really feel like i am. since im pretty socially confident at this point.
my sister and my friend at work and my bf however, say that its possible i do hahah.

i think maybe its adhd.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.

1h7fcyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CICO/comments/1h7fcyp/facing_the_scale_postvacation_a_recap/,Facing the scale post-vacation: a recap ,"Hey all, obviously there have been a ton of “how are you navigating the holidays?” and “oh no what if I gain weight?” posts as of late, to add to the ever popular genre of “what am I supposed to do on vacation?” anxiety posts. So, I thought I’d add a little recap here as I come back from one week in Paris, about the strategies I used and the results I found. I made both *mindset adjustments* and *behavioral adjustments” that ongoing worked to support each other well, just as they do during active weight loss.

I love to cook, love to eat, love wine, so I thought through the trip beforehand and clarified my goals, deciding ahead of time that I wouldn’t try for any kind of deficit, and would be ok with going to maintenance or even a bit over daily. It’s one week after all - and it’s French food! World famous! At the same time, I resolved to not just have a “fuck it” mentality, or a restriction rebound pattern (“this is my ONE CHANCE, better eat EVERYTHING”) as neither of those actually typically feel very pleasurable, and my goal was to really enjoy all the wine and food (for reference, I live in the Netherlands. The food is… bad lol). 

I then chose a couple behaviors to support those goals:

1) I packed my blender bottle full of whey protein powder for the trip, and bought some of my usual yogurt protein drinks as soon as I got to my airbnb 😂. I felt sort of silly doing this, but honestly, it was a fantastic idea - I do unflavored whey with 4oz of water (double thick, gets frothy) every morning and use it as creamer in my morning tea/coffee along with a protein drink for breakfast. Having both these on hand meant I had some touchstone of my usual routine, and set me up well to actually choose and enjoy whatever food I wanted all day, rather than wind up grabbing something and inhaling it without even relishing the calories because I’m hangry and off my routine. 

2) I kept with logging, but I did it at the end of the day, making educated guesses and not sweating the details. Usually I log as I go, or I pre-log the day, so I can adjust things as needed. I wanted to still log to give myself a general idea, but knew it wouldn’t be super accurate because of eating out constantly, not weighing, etc. so I just caught up at the end of the day with my best guesses, and didn’t stress about whatever the result was. 

3) I kept the steps up. Not for weight loss, just seeing things, but I was averaging around 15k, about 5k higher than my usual average, so I was also able to reassure myself that this was helping with extra consumption. 

On average, my log shows I was about 250 over maintenance for the past 7 days - so I’ll have gained at least half a pound! Probably closer to a full with logging inaccuracies, etc. But honestly… a half pound for all that?? A week of tarts every night, pastries every morning, a bottle of wine and the better part a baguette to myself several evenings? I’ll *happily* take that exchange! Knowing the math works both ways… man, that really helps.

I noticed that for the first 3-4 days, I was REALLY enjoying every bite, and every sip… it was great! Then I got a bit fatigued… I missed my usual diet, and was aching for vegetables. Stuff was still good, but I was getting oversaturated, and the bar was moving, things not being quite as delectable as they were just a few days prior. By the 7th day, I was genuinely over it. Found myself grocery listing and meal planning on the train home and really looking forward to a big salad and a light chicken dinner. So that was interesting to observe.  

My first weigh in back, I admit, I was scared to face the scale! I told myself the reality of math is the above, I CANT have gained more than that, and to expect up to 5lbs gained on the scale with water weight, alcohol, etc. But I was just 3lbs “up” - 3 measly pounds! Sometimes I change that day to day for literally no reason at all 🤷 

So, this is a long post, but just to say - keep at it, everyone! The more I do this and keep steady, the more it helps to undo years of disordered thinking around eating…. When I see I can eat quite literally whatever the fuck I want for a week, and it only makes .5-1 lbs difference, I’m a lot more resolved and less hopeless. I feel able to really enjoy my enjoyment AND not let it crush other goals for my life. What has felt like a pendulum swing my whole life is starting to even out. CICO is slowly giving me back control over my life, my sense of reason, and my sense of agency. I couldn’t be more grateful.

1) My dad is looking to buy his wife (70) an espresso machine for Christmas to get her to stop spending $7 at Starbucks lattes daily. We want to get her something manual, as I know those tend to have a longer life than automatic machines, but wants other people's opinions on this. My dad is a very practical and budget-y person and wants advice on a machine that is a decent price (probably low hundreds) but good value for what it is. He's looking at the Breville Bambino right now, since Consumer Reports recommends it. Additionally, dad says they already have a coffee grinder, but it's something worth like $20 so I figure she'll need something better. 

2) I'm also looking for a machine for myself. I was originally looking at automatics w/ grinders for convenience (mainly the De'Longhi Magnifica Start if it goes on sale again for $499 on Amazon), since I'm a college student that's used quick and easy coffee--I use a Keurig daily right now. However, I'm considering a manual since the machines are smaller and my apartment kitchen cabinets cover all counter space and I'm afraid I won't be able to pour beans in the grinder. I don't know anything about grinders lmao, but for the espresso machine itself, my budget is probably $350 max. I need help picking both.

Thoughts? ,"We were smart to get there 15 minutes prior to open, but the communication between the host and servers was not executed well. We were just ordering when people who arrived 20 minutes after us were almost leaving. When we were the 2nd party to arrive, we still waited over 30 minutes after being open before being seated.

That being said, our server did acknowledge that and was kind. Because they didn't turn the heaters on well in advance, which they could of done at open when they saw we had our little pup, the heat lamps did not provide enough heat to keep us warm. The cold was more than uncomfortable and could have been mitigated better. I feel they should have maybe offered more than a small apology for the fine dining price paid.

I would also  say they should mention having outdoor heated seating for the wintertime is not ideal, as it was one of the first things  mentioned when you look the establishment up on google or I would have gotten a sitter for my pup and ate inside where it would be comfortable.

The food was spectacular and I'm glad we had a very delicious breakfast. I enjoyed a warm scone, and my partner stated the Bloody Mary was perfect. Crab Benedict was fresh and tasty, and the fritatta was flavorful.

If I ever decide to return, I will make sure I make proper adjustments in order to better enjoy my meal.

Edit: All people in the party of just 2 were there at the very get go.. We were the 2nd group to arrive. Everyone else that was there behind us got seated first, maybe because we were having outside seating? Still wasn't fair. Even large groups, we even watched people walk up and get seated before us while the host watched us wait, and my partner had to remind the host we were the 2nd people to arrive. 15 minutes before open because we were trying to be prepared. This was suggested as dog friendly. We did have blankets, jackets, and a dog carrier inside a dog stroller, and I had multiple jackets, but my toes were numb before even getting seated. We were also visiting from out of town, so leaving at home was not an option. I had called prior and was assured that, even if it was cold, it would not be a problem. I did everything in my power to avoid any complications.  If I had any hint, we'd be hindered in comfort. I would have paid for a dogsitter,  which I did for other restaurant visits that I called in advance as well to make sure I could prepare my out of trip time properly. The tone of the reply was assumptive and condescending. If you were not there, then why not inquire before or investigate before replying? The heat lamps weren't turned on until we sat down and provided zero heat and were barely warm prior to leaving. We didn't just have a scone. We had a driink and two full meals, which the response acknowledged some of this, but still made it an excuse what other people may do. They assumed i was not prepared, but we were all wearing sweaters and jackets and layers upon layer. We wouldn't have been so cold if we were also seated in fair order. This saddens me because I don't feel like I'd be welcomed back. I'm sure the business will do fine without my business, no doubt, but I left an honest review to be met with zero empathy and unkindness. There are also so many other establishments that provide absolutely delicious food. We were just trying something new to maybe add to our route when we visit quarterly until we find the property that suits us.

Response from the owner 3 days ago
Allow me to explain a little bit about the restaurant business. Other than what you mentioned above, I don’t know your particular details as I wasn’t present when you dined with us so I’ll try to be somewhat general.  
We don’t seat parties unless all persons are there.  We’ve had troubles with this in the past and while I’m sorry guests have to wait, we can’t have a table being held for an hour without ordering while they wait for their friend who ‘is on the way.’ Please don’t assume that since  your table ordered multiple dishes, it doesn’t necessarily mean that all tables will do that.  Sometimes we have guests who get coffee and a scone and then leave.  Naturally, they have a shorter time at the table than those ordering more food. While I don’t know for a fact what the table that you mentioned ordered, I’d just ask that you bear that in mind. As for seating, I know that folks are hungry and ready to go when they arrive outside TLT. When we first opened, we tried seating everyone immediately upon opening and found out very quickly that it overwhelmed the kitchen with orders that couldn’t possibly all be processed in a timely fashion. So that got changed very quickly. We now space out our first seating of guests to ensure that the kitchen can prepare the orders appropriately.  Once that first group starts to depart, they never all leave at the same time and  we don’t have a ‘group rush’ to deal with throughout the rest of the day. On top of that, (and I know everyone is getting tired of hearing this. WE are TOO!) but staffing has been short recently.  We are striving to fill positions but it is not easy.  Regardless, I do understand that no one likes to wait, particularly when you can see open tables.
Yes, we offer heat sources.  As you no doubt saw, we have heating pyramids at the tables and firepits in the parklet.  These were designed to ‘help’ with the cold, not necessarily to do away with it.  Frankly, I’m not really sure what else we could offer. We have a lot of folks who bring their dogs in the winter and we love having them there. Sometimes, customers bring mats for their pooches to lay on, while others simply rely on the general furriness of man’s best friend.  If you have a less-than-furry beast, might I suggest a sweater or as you mentioned, leave them at home cozy in their beds.
I’m glad to see you ordered the crab benedict. That is one of our best sellers and I hope you enjoyed it.  We’ve also been told by a lot of our guests that our Bloody Marys are the best in town. Again, I’m glad that they were to your satisfaction.  I hope you do decide to come back, with or without Fido, so we can wow you with some more of the best food in town.  Thanks for writing in.

Hi All -

Thanks in advance for your recommendations. Just as a disclaimer I have an appointment tomorrow already scheduled with the Gastro about my issue but I would like to check here to hear some opinions. 

My issue started 3 weeks +/- ago in a long flight, I was on my seat and my headphones felt, so from sitting position I tried to grab them and I forced and overextended a lot, so somehow I got in an awkward position that brought a very strong Sharp pain on the left side of the stomach between the rib cage and the middle stomach, it was so strong that I passed out. Doctor in plane check my vitals and all was in order, no high / low pressure no hearth issues or so, he mentioned most likely I pushed some internal organ causing the pain and knocking me out. 

Since then  I started to feel bloated, and feeling small pains mostly on the left side, not strong just small pains that come and go. 

I have not passed one day without going to the toilet, no fever, no vomiting, not stomach burn or whatsoever, I have been eating different things and there is nothing coming out besides this bloating and I can feel some movements inside my belly. 

Appetite is a bit less mostly on dinner time and I don't breakfast by default, also I feel a bit more tired these days but also can be because I have cut coffee entirely. 
Am 39 years old, 95 kilos and my latest general check was less then 6 months ago where everything came back good, I exercise regularly (cardio and kettlebells mostly) and I have no other diseases besides light asthma ( not meds needed) and have some disk issue on my lower back.

We have known of each other for well over 8 years but we have never met, just followed each other on social media. 

Back story: We had chatted a bit on social media back when we first added each other but we never met. This past September, I walked by him at a restaurant. I was with friends and so was he so we just glanced at each other but neither of us approached the other since we weren't sure if it was the right person. About a month later, he messaged me and asked if it was me at the restaurant. We got to talking and he ended up asking me out for dinner on Saturday to catch up.  

At dinner, he told me that he ended his engagement about 5 months ago, my last relationship was a year and a half ago. He was with her for 5 years and he mentioned how most women on the apps immediately unmatch him knowing how recent his break up was. I told him that I likely would not have gone out with him either had I known because I don't think someone can be ready to start something new after such a short period of time. He said that normally he would agree but because he was the one to end the relationship, he was already mentally/emotionally checked out months prior so it feels like longer to him and he is ready to move on. The date went great. We had a lot of chemistry and it went on for about 7 hours (dinner followed by drinks) and it ended with a kiss, granted we were both a bit tipsy. He was a complete gentleman and he messaged me as soon as he got home. We continued to talk almost everyday via text with the exception of a day or two in between. After this is where things got confusing for me... 

It was almost a week since our date and he made no mention of a second date even though we were talking everyday. In conversation one day, I made a joke that was something along the lines of ""I guess it's a one and done for the effort in planning dates"" (our conversation style is lots of dry humor and banter). Immediately after I said that, he said he'd plan a second date and we could go out for ""casual burgers"" because that was easy enough to plan (which is okay - I don't expect lavish dates, even a walk or coffee is fine by me as long as effort has been made to plan it) . So we did that the following day on a Saturday and again, great chemistry, lots of talking. It was a shorter date, only about an hour and a half because we both worked the next day. It ended a bit awkwardly, with him dropping me off and giving me a hug but no kiss. I thought maybe he was no longer interested so I was planning to just leave it at that but he immediately texted me after leaving again and said he had a great time and continued the conversation. Again, we texted almost everyday but he didn't ask me out again. I was planning to go visit my friend in another city for the weekend and after I mentioned that, he casually said maybe we could do something on the day I got back if I wasn't too tired but he didn't make any concrete plans. The day came and I got back and he still hadn't said anything. It was almost 6pm at this point so I asked him if he still wanted to meet and he asked if I would want to come out to his area (he came out my way the first two times). I live downtown and he lives far out in the suburbs where there isn't as much to do. I had already been driving all day for 8+ hours and going to him would be another hour drive each way and I worked early the next morning whereas he was off the next day. It just felt very lazy to me and like he already got lazy with the effort after just one date. 

I feel like he put all his effort into the first date to make it special and the second date only happened because I made a joke and brought it up and there wasn't even a thought put into the third date. I ended up declining and said I didn't want to drive again after being on the road all day and he said he understood and we would raincheck. Since then, our communication has fallen off. We've been texting here and there but not very often and there are 1-2 days in between texts. He always ends the conversation saying he'll message me the next day and then he doesn't and will message 2 days later instead. Maybe I'm being too critical but this is putting me off because I like when someone keeps their word. 

So I turn to reddit - what do all of you think about this? Am I wasting my time here or am I being too impatient? It has been about 6 weeks since we reconnected and have been texting and we have only seen each other twice. He seems really into me when we are together in person but the communication seems inconsistent when we're not. Also - to be completely transparent because I will acknowledge my part in it too, I rarely text him first or reach out first. But I did mention this to him during our first date. I told him that maybe I'm traditional in that way but I believe that a man should court a woman and initiate dates/communication for the first few dates anyway and then once something is somewhat established, I have no problem also putting in the effort to plan dates etc. I also told him that I prefer phone calls and in person over texting and he has still never once called me even though he said he also prefers that. 

TLDR: known each other for years but never met, reconnected 6 weeks ago. First date was great and he planned it, second date was a week after and only happened because I brought it up, third date was also supposed to be a week after but had no concrete plans and never ended up happening. Communication in between dates flip flops between being consistent and non existent. Confused about whether to continue.

My name's Jeff I'm 26 and I currently live in Utah but I'm originally from and plan to move back to Arizona in the future hopefully within a year or less.

At the expense of potentially having one of those TMI moments 😅 the reason I'm looking for some friends is because a few months back I left my Mormon Fundamentalist Polygamist Cult. So fun fact, I have 3 moms 💁🏼‍♀️ and tons of siblings. One of the consequences I knew for leaving was that I was going to lose all my friends. It was gradual but even close friends eventually stopped associating with me. My girlfriend at the time, who was not in the cult, gave me the courage to stand up to my parents and the cult. She was a big cornerstone in my life. However, very recently we mutually agreed to break up but that's a different story. 

So, I'm hoping to find some "" normal"" friends and start exploring the real world a little more. Like trying coffee lol. But hey I do like it when people are a little weird, I'm loads of weird myself. For example I like putting ice in my milk and call it ""chunky milk"". I'll sleep in jeans sometimes and I'll add that I sleep really good, like a highschool boy with no care for his future. I'd say baby but babies wake up all the time. And I might get murdered for this one but I like my steak well done, it just tastes significantly better to me 🤷🏼‍♀️.

Some other facts and interest about me 

- I like running and working out 
- I like learning about Military history 
- Recently started getting into F1 racing
- I like singing! I'd rate myself a 5.4/10. 
- Minecraft and B03 zombies only 2 games I really play
- I am a Christian and Conservative 
- I'm working to go to nursing school 
- my humor tends to be on the crude/dark and goofy side
- I have 2 bunnies!? Still surprises me everyday
- my name's not actually Jeff but 99% of people call me Jeff and maybe 50% of those people don't know my real name. 
- I speak English , Spanish, French and I am Latino.

And of course there's a lot more but hopefully we can get to know each other better together! 

 As for what I'm looking for in a friend ideally I'd want you to be close to my time (MST) or the USA. If you're in Utah or Arizona that would be great, but not required, cuz I'd love to meet you! Texting is great but if youre open to Voice and video call that's a plus! I don't bite hard! I am more interested  in longterm friends. I'd like to surround myself with people I can grow and learn from. Other than that just be a kind, understanding person with integrity :) and be your genuine self!  I'm really open to everyone!

So we did that the following day on a Saturday and again, great chemistry, lots of talking. It was a shorter date, only about an hour and a half because we both worked the next day. It ended a bit awkwardly, with him dropping me off and giving me a hug but no kiss. I thought maybe he was no longer interested so I was planning to just leave it at that but he immediately texted me after leaving again and said he had a great time and continued the conversation. Again, we texted almost everyday but he didn't ask me out again. I was planning to go visit my friend in another city for the weekend and after I mentioned that, he casually said maybe we could do something on the day I got back if I wasn't too tired but he didn't make any concrete plans. The day came and I got back and he still hadn't said anything. It was almost 6pm at this point so I asked him if he still wanted to meet and he asked if I would want to come out to his area (he came out my way the first two times). I live downtown and he lives far out in the suburbs where there isn't as much to do. I had already been driving all day for 8+ hours and going to him would be another hour drive each way and I worked early the next morning whereas he was off the next day. It just felt very lazy to me and like he already got lazy with the effort after just one date. 

I feel like he put all his effort into the first date to make it special and the second date only happened because I made a joke and brought it up and there wasn't even a thought put into the third date. I ended up declining and said I didn't want to drive again after being on the road all day and he said he understood and we would raincheck. Since then, our communication has fallen off. We've been texting here and there but not very often and there are 1-2 days in between texts. He always ends the conversation saying he'll message me the next day and then he doesn't and will message 2 days later instead. Maybe I'm being too critical but this is putting me off because I like when someone keeps their word. 

So I turn to reddit - what do all of you think about this? Am I wasting my time here or am I being too impatient? It has been about 6 weeks since we reconnected and have been texting and we have only seen each other twice. He seems really into me when we are together in person but the communication seems inconsistent when we're not. Also - to be completely transparent because I will acknowledge my part in it too, I rarely text him first or reach out first. But I did mention this to him during our first date. I told him that maybe I'm traditional in that way but I believe that a man should court a woman and initiate dates/communication for the first few dates anyway and then once something is somewhat established, I have no problem also putting in the effort to plan dates etc. I also told him that I prefer phone calls and in person over texting and he has still never once called me even though he said he also prefers that. 

TLDR: known each other for years but never met, reconnected 6 weeks ago. First date was great and he planned it, second date was a week after and only happened because I brought it up, third date was also supposed to be a week after but had no concrete plans and never ended up happening. Communication in between dates flip flops between being consistent and non existent. Confused about whether to continue.

We have known of each other for well over 8 years but we have never met, just followed each other on social media. 

Back story: We had chatted a bit on social media back when we first added each other but we never met. This past September, I walked by him at a restaurant. I was with friends and so was he so we just glanced at each other but neither of us approached the other since we weren't sure if it was the right person. About a month later, he messaged me and asked if it was me at the restaurant. We got to talking and he ended up asking me out for dinner on Saturday to catch up.  

At dinner, he told me that he ended his engagement about 5 months ago, my last relationship was a year and a half ago. He was with her for 5 years and he mentioned how most women on the apps immediately unmatch him knowing how recent his break up was. I told him that I likely would not have gone out with him either had I known because I don't think someone can be ready to start something new after such a short period of time. He said that normally he would agree but because he was the one to end the relationship, he was already mentally/emotionally checked out months prior so it feels like longer to him and he is ready to move on. The date went great. We had a lot of chemistry and it went on for about 7 hours (dinner followed by drinks) and it ended with a kiss, granted we were both a bit tipsy. He was a complete gentleman and he messaged me as soon as he got home. We continued to talk almost everyday via text with the exception of a day or two in between. After this is where things got confusing for me... 

It was almost a week since our date and he made no mention of a second date even though we were talking everyday. In conversation one day, I made a joke that was something along the lines of ""I guess it's a one and done for the effort in planning dates"" (our conversation style is lots of dry humor and banter).

Many people said it's important to either have a window on the door or keep it cracked or open so they could see if someone was busy before approaching them. 

I can't get that off my mind because I don't understand it.  There's no part of my day when I take a break to make paper airplanes or take a nap on the floor.  You will *always* be interrupting *something* if you come talk to me, which is absolutely fine, but I see that as an inherent element of talking to someone at work, except in the break room.  

I.e., there's no time to come talk to me where you wouldn't be interrupting.  Again, not an issue because that's part of my job, too.  I just don't understand the concept of trying not to do so.

I never felt truly hungry or weird (probably because I put a bit of milk into the coffee so that took care of the minerals) so I'm going to break-fast around 5pm EST.

I read a bit online and looks like there is a recommendation about 2x (for me that's 6 days) period before going back to normal. For me ""normal"" is going to be 18-6 fasting. I don't want to do 6 days but will probably do 4 days.

My first dinner is going to be chicken broth + some vegies. **My first question is: is it fine as long as I don't touch the ""heavy"" food (a lot of meat, cake, non-whole grain bread, etc.) during the 4-day break-fast period?**

**Second question**: I don't want to go full keto. I want to go 72h water fast every month + post-fast-reconvery + 18-6 ordinary food for the rest and see how my weight goes. Is it OK to dial the body back to glucose during the ""ordinary food"" period (around 3 weeks per month)? For the 6 hours of eating, I'll pretty much remove refined sugar (think cake, muffins, whatever) from the menu, EXCEPT maybe once/twice a week as a treat, but it's still going to be carbon heavy for breakfast, and NO-carbon for lunch.

Do you think it's fine for the objective? My objective is to gradually lower BMI from 30 to around 25/26 so I think I don't need crazy fasting plan or go keto.

My name's Jeff I'm 26 and I currently live in Utah but I'm originally from and plan to move back to Arizona in the future hopefully within a year or less.

At the expense of potentially having one of those TMI moments 😅 the reason I'm looking for some friends is because a few months back I left my Mormon Fundamentalist Polygamist Cult. So fun fact, I have 3 moms 💁🏼‍♀️ and tons of siblings. One of the consequences I knew for leaving was that I was going to lose all my friends. It was gradual but even close friends eventually stopped associating with me. My girlfriend at the time, who was not in the cult, gave me the courage to stand up to my parents and the cult. She was a big cornerstone in my life. However, very recently we mutually agreed to break up but that's a different story. 

So, I'm hoping to find some "" normal"" friends and start exploring the real world a little more. Like trying coffee lol. But hey I do like it when people are a little weird, I'm loads of weird myself. For example I like putting ice in my milk and call it ""chunky milk"". I'll sleep in jeans sometimes and I'll add that I sleep really good, like a highschool boy with no care for his future. I'd say baby but babies wake up all the time. And I might get murdered for this one but I like my steak well done, it just tastes significantly better to me 🤷🏼‍♀️.

Some other facts and interest about me 

- I like running and working out 
- I like learning about Military history 
- Recently started getting into F1 racing
- I like singing! I'd rate myself a 5.4/10. 
- Minecraft and B03 zombies only 2 games I really play
- I am a Christian and Conservative 
- I'm working to go to nursing school 
- my humor tends to be on the crude/dark and goofy side
- I have 2 bunnies!? Still surprises me everyday
- my name's not actually Jeff but 99% of people call me Jeff and maybe 50% of those people don't know my real name. 
- I speak English , Spanish, French and I am Latino.

And of course there's a lot more but hopefully we can get to know each other better together! 

 As for what I'm looking for in a friends ideally I'd want you to be close to my time (MST) or the USA. If you're in Utah or Arizona that would be great, but not required, cuz I'd love to meet you! Texting is great but if youre open to Voice and video call that's a plus! I don't bite hard! I am more interested  in longterm friends. I'd like to surround myself with people I can grow and learn from. Other than that just be a kind, understanding person with integrity :) and be your genuine self!  I'm really open to everyone!

I’m loosing my mind.,"Yesterday was a normal day. I (29m) woke up, did my normal morning routine, and laid down on the couch for a little nap before my partner (25m) got up. When he woke up I got up and had this gut feeling not to go to work. (I wasn’t scheduled anyways I was just coming in as extra) So, I called work to let them know I wouldn’t be making it in. After that, my partner started his morning routine and I decided to check my emails. Lo and behold I got my official acceptance letter from ASU. I also got an email from the physics department welcoming me with open arms. I was super excited!!! Anyways, I fixed my partners coffee, and had his things ready for him to grab and go (as he was running a little late). 

After he leaves, I get a call from my advisor and she walked me through some little things I needed to do. After I got off the phone with her I tried to call my mom. (she had been in the hospital for a couple of days for some stomach pain) well she didn’t answer. So I figured maybe she was resting so I texted a few of my friends celebrating my acceptance…

Then, my stepdad calls. (My parents live in South Carolina and I live across the country in Oregon). He tells me she’s going in for surgery on her bowels. I said okay, I have some good news for her when she gets out! When we get off the phone I say a little prayer to the universe and go back to texting friends. About an hour later my stepdad calls again… I answer and without pause he immediately tells me she’s not going to make it…. It didn’t register.. so I ask if I can talk to her, and he informed me she was heavily sedated to keep her from being in pain. Then he also tells me that if they bring her back she’s extremely likely to have a heart attack. So he doesn’t want her to suffer. So I ask if he can at least hold the phone up to her so I can say goodbye. I’m absolutely loosing my shit at this point. 

So, I say what I need to say and tell her I made it into college and then just absolutely ball my eyes out. He asked me if I was done and I said yes, then he said I have to call uncle Billy and everyone and says I’m so sorry she was a great mother and a wonderful woman. Hangs up. I’m stuck in this gutter shock and awe. My emotions have been coming in waves… after crying all day yesterday I’m feeling numb at this point. I don’t know what to do, what to say, how to feel…. I’m completely lost. My mom was my everything…. When I came out of the closet at 18 I lost 95% of my family and friends. But I’ve always had my mom… I don’t know what I’m going to do without her.. we talked every single day, and now I just feel like I have nothing…. No purpose… and I don’t know if it’s the grief or my emotions being high but I have such a weird feeling from my stepdads reaction…. He’s just been…. Cold… maybe that’s how he grieves,  but I just cannot wrap my head around it. My mom had kidney problems and a kidney transplant 5 years ago, but this was so sudden and had nothing to do with her kidneys. I just cannot for the life of me understand. 

If anyone has advice it would be so greatly appreciated. I have my partner here to hold me while I cry but I just need help.. so since I don’t have any family I came here. I just need help with this lost feeling that I have… like I just feel so lost without a purpose in life now. And everything makes me feel selfish… eating, watching tv to get my mind away from everything, doing anything feels selfish. Please help Reddit. 🥺

My (42M) gf (33F) and I have been together for just over a year.  during the last year, we have shared a lot of good times and memories, i love her very much.  one thing that has been a constant wrench for me is her lack of time management skills which causes her to be late to everything (1-2 hours late) and wastes my time. in addition, her driving is very unsafe (i almost got broadsided when she turned onto a street with a car coming, she's ran red lights, will creep out into the intersection when she doesn't have the  right of way, will backup into traffic, drives directly into potholes and never tries to avoid them, ran over a milk crate and didn't stop until i said something).  she insists on driving most of the time which gives me anxiety. on vacation she wants to drive the rental when it's under my insurance, I just don't have the heart to tell her she's a bad driver and it gives me concern when she drives a vehicle that i'm liable for.

when we're home and dating it's not a big deal since we don't live together, i can tolerate her tardiness to a degree.  everything came to a head a week ago when we were on vacay.  we've had many vacays over the last year and one thing that always happens is i end up doing 90% of the work (planning, paying for everything, packing, itinerary, etc) and the little responsibility she has, she has a hard time completing on time.  the original agreement was I pay for vacations, she plans the trip (flights, hotels, etc).  that never worked, i tried to depend on her to do that on our first vacay, she never did and I ended up having to plan and pay for everything at a higher cost since it was a shorter time to the flight date.

on vacay over thanksgiving, my patience started to wear thin. it's little things like losing a tent stake for our beach mat when I let her be responsible for it, putting sandy/dirty things in my backpack when she knows i'm meticulous about organization and keeping my pack clean.  i feel like i cant' depend on her.

the last night of vacay we agreed to stay up late to pack up everything so we could leave early in the morning to go to the national park we were staying next to.  it gets crowded super fast so we wanted to get there right at open.  the plan was, I clean up the car, pack up everything while she takes a shower so all she had to do was pack her clothing while i took a shower after i cleaned the car/packed.  after an hour of cleaning the rental car, I come back to the room to find she hadn't showered or packed and was on the phone.  so i hop in the shower while she's on the phone.  after i'm done showering she still hasn't packed and was still on the phone.  she ended up having to stay up till 2 am to finish packing, i was done with everything by midnight.

we agreed to leave at 7:30a to get to the park right at open.  well.. that didn't happen.  i was packed and ready to go at 7:30a.  she just starts making her morning coffee at 7:30a.  i dont say anything but i'm starting to get irritated.  at 8a she says she wants to go to the beach attached to our airbnb to have her coffee.  i say whatever, she goes to the beach.  she gets back at 8:15 and we finally leave for the park at 8:30a.

during our time at the park we went on a hike.  she was not in a good mood. complaining about being tired, seemingly unaware that it was her fault she got to bed so late.  the hike, she is walking incredibly slow, to the point where the hike is not enjoyable for me, constantly waiting for her.  the whole time she has a attitude.  on the hike back, i decided i was tired of waiting and dealing with her bad mood and hiked at a pace that I enjoy (it wasn't a fast pace or anything, other hikers still were passing me) and that i would wait for her at the next fork in the trail.  i was about 2 mins ahead of her.  while waiting for her at the fork she comes following a few minutes later, upset I didn't wait for her.  apparently she slipped and fell and was mad I wasn't there to help her.  suddenly her hiking pace was at a breakneck speed, one I had a hard time keeping up with.  it made me question why she couldnt keep a normal pace prior to this.

My (42M) gf (33F) and I have been together for just over a year.  during the last year, we have shared a lot of good times and memories, i love her very much.  one thing that has been a constant wrench for me is her lack of time management skills which causes her to be late to everything (1-2 hours late) and wastes my time. in addition, her driving is very unsafe (i almost got broadsided when she turned onto a street with a car coming, she's ran red lights, will creep out into the intersection when she doesn't have the  right of way, will backup into traffic, drives directly into potholes and never tries to avoid them, ran over a milk crate and didn't stop until i said something).  she insists on driving most of the time which gives me anxiety. on vacation she wants to drive the rental when it's under my insurance, I just don't have the heart to tell her she's a bad driver and it gives me concern when she drives a vehicle that i'm liable for.

when we're home and dating it's not a big deal since we don't live together, i can tolerate her tardiness to a degree.  everything came to a head a week ago when we were on vacay.  we've had many vacays over the last year and one thing that always happens is i end up doing 90% of the work (planning, paying for everything, packing, itinerary, etc) and the little responsibility she has, she has a hard time completing on time.  the original agreement was I pay for vacations, she plans the trip (flights, hotels, etc).  that never worked, i tried to depend on her to do that on our first vacay, she never did and I ended up having to plan and pay for everything at a higher cost since it was a shorter time to the flight date.

on vacay over thanksgiving, my patience started to wear thin. it's little things like losing a tent stake for our beach mat when I let her be responsible for it, putting sandy/dirty things in my backpack when she knows i'm meticulous about organization and keeping my pack clean.  i feel like i cant' depend on her.

the last night of vacay we agreed to stay up late to pack up everything so we could leave early in the morning to go to the national park we were staying next to.  it gets crowded super fast so we wanted to get there right at open.  the plan was, I clean up the car, pack up everything while she takes a shower so all she had to do was pack her clothing while i took a shower after i cleaned the car/packed.  after an hour of cleaning the rental car, I come back to the room to find she hadn't showered or packed and was on the phone.  so i hop in the shower while she's on the phone.  after i'm done showering she still hasn't packed and was still on the phone.  she ended up having to stay up till 2 am to finish packing, i was done with everything by midnight.

we agreed to leave at 7:30a to get to the park right at open.  well.. that didn't happen.  i was packed and ready to go at 7:30a.  she just starts making her morning coffee at 7:30a.  i dont say anything but i'm starting to get irritated.  at 8a she says she wants to go to the beach attached to our airbnb to have her coffee.  i say whatever, she goes to the beach.  she gets back at 8:15 and we finally leave for the park at 8:30a.

during our time at the park we went on a hike.  she was not in a good mood. complaining about being tired, seemingly unaware that it was her fault she got to bed so late.  the hike, she is walking incredibly slow, to the point where the hike is not enjoyable for me, constantly waiting for her.  the whole time she has a attitude.  on the hike back, i decided i was tired of waiting and dealing with her bad mood and hiked at a pace that I enjoy (it wasn't a fast pace or anything, other hikers still were passing me) and that i would wait for her at the next fork in the trail.  i was about 2 mins ahead of her.  while waiting for her at the fork she comes following a few minutes later, upset I didn't wait for her.  apparently she slipped and fell and was mad I wasn't there to help her.  suddenly her hiking pace was at a breakneck speed, one I had a hard time keeping up with.  it made me question why she couldnt keep a normal pace prior to this.

the night prior, she had left the bathroom window open, which doesn't have a screen and dozens of mosquitos were biting my all night while I slept.  I woke up with dozens of bites on my back and legs.  I am very allergic to insect bites, I swell up.  she didn't seem to care at all.  this is on top of everything else that happened in the latter paragraph.

1h7ekun,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h7ekun/spongeman_part_1/,Sponge-Man (Part 1),"I used to live in a place of anarchy.

It is wealthy and well-developed now, but it was not always like this. It was filled to the brim with crimes and lawlessness. Over time, though, things have gotten better. The crime rate dropped as more people found jobs, and the community started to stabilize.

Anarchy has become rare nowadays. But it still exists, even after all these years. I, myself, have seen my fair share of torts and crimes, from accidents to murders. You name it.

But there exists one incident which still haunts me. It happened fifteen years ago. I’ll try to provide the most detailed account of that day and the circumstances surrounding it. However, since it was so long ago, and I was pretty young at the time, there’s a chance I might misremember or unintentionally exaggerate some aspects of this incident. So please proceed with that in mind.

It happened when I was eight, a few weeks before my ninth birthday. I vividly remember dreaming about my birthday party before waking up on my own. It was a bizarre dream. I don’t remember much, but I do remember my mother being there. It had been six months since her death, and it was hard for me to process a birthday without her.

I got out of bed and walked towards the balcony. My father was surprised to see me awake and sensed something was off.

“What happened? Is something wrong?” Father asked as he kept the newspaper on the coffee table and walked towards me.

“Yeah, just the sunlight,” I said as he stroked my hair.

“Oh, I’ll make sure to close the blinds next time...” he took an uncomfortable pause. He was better at being a single parent but still wasn’t used to it.

“Now go get ready. The driver said that he will come early today.”

“Why? Is Ava not coming?” I asked in a desperate tone. I had a crush on her even before I knew what a crush was. She and I had a lot in common; for example, her father was a cop, while my father was a cop and turned private investigator. Plus, she was a tomboy, a quality which I admire.

“Don’t worry. Ava and Timothy are coming. The driver just needs to bring the van in for servicing.”

“Servicing?” I asked, rubbing my eyes.

“When a vehicle gets old, they don’t work properly or stop working entirely. When this happens, they are given for servicing, where they are fixed.”

“Oh, is our car serviced, dad?”  
“Don’t worry about our car, champ. It’s all taken care of. Now go get ready for school.”

I don’t remember much about going to school that day or what happened in class—I was really sleepy. But I do remember an announcement the principal made just before the school got over. She addressed a rumor that was spreading in our primary school. The rumour said that some treasure was found on the school premises during the construction of the football field.

I remember her speech vividly because it was the first time I’d seen her that angry. I was also really confused at the time and couldn’t help but giggle during her speech, thinking she had said “Hogwarts” while addressing the rumors. It didn’t last long, though, as Timothy stomped on my foot and explained that she had actually said “Hogwash,” meaning nonsense.

Timothy was like Hermione in our group. He knew a lot and wasn’t shy about sharing his knowledge with others. Even if they were uninterested. Unlike Hermione, he was timid and kind of a pussy. It was impossible to convince him to do anything even remotely fun.

A total buzzkill.

Coming back to the day, “Hogwash” wasn’t the only term I learned from her monologue. Mass Hysteria was another one. She began her speech by explaining what it meant. “Mass Hysteria brings nothing but confusion. It’s an illness,” she said. And it stuck with me. I’d heard stories about people collectively losing their minds, but now I finally had a name for it.

Her monologue lasted for ten minutes, after which we were dismissed. I ran to grab the seat next to the driver while Ava, Timothy, and the other kids went back. Once all the kids were in the van, the driver activated the child locks on the doors and shut them.

There were nine children in the van that day. We three had the last stops. Timothy’s stop was right before mine, and Ava’s was the very last. At each stop, the driver would park the van, get out, and open the door for the kids. He always stayed outside until he saw the kids safely reach their homes.

He and I used to get along. We would talk about all sorts of things like TV shows or the news, but mostly, he liked sharing stories and local legends.

I remember him once telling the story of a war veteran who had lost both of his arms in the war. Later in his life as an old man, he began to believe that each morning, someone would sneak into his home and sever his arms. The old man also claimed that another person would visit late at night to reattach them, only for the cycle to repeat the next day. Not even his devoted daughter believed him. As time passed, the old man grew increasingly paranoid.  
One night, in complete darkness, he leaped from his balcony to his death. His daughter discovered what had happened the next morning. But the eeriest part of the story was her claim that the balcony door had been latched—and the latch was at least two feet above the man’s reach.

I used to enjoy stories like that. I’d always try to sit next to the driver and wouldn’t leave the van until he finished his stories. But that day, it was different.

The driver’s mood seemed off. When I asked him, he said that he could not get the servicing done. When I pressed further, he said, “It’s a long story.” He looked very upset, so I decided not to bother him the entire way home.

Soon, it was just the three of us and the driver in the van.

The middle row of the van, where Ava and Timothy were sitting, had seats that faced each other, something like [this](https://assets.tractorjunction.com/truck-junction/assets/images/truck/mahindra-suprovan-other1.webp?format=webp). (Please note that this isn’t a photo of the van model I was in; it is just a photo of a random van with a similar design.)

In the moving van, Ava and Timothy decided to jump from one seat to the seat in front of them for fun. The driver slowed down the van and yelled, “Stop jumping in the moving van! You’re going to get hurt. If you don’t stop, I’ll tell your parents!” But they didn’t stop.  
Seeing them having fun made me very jealous. I wished that I was there instead of the front.

As the driver was slowing down the van and yelling at them, Ava started to fall in the gap between the two seats. She grabbed Timothy for support and pulled him down with her. The driver quickly pulled over the van and ran outside to help them as both were screaming in pain. He helped both of them and inquired about their injuries, and then he started.

“What did I tell both of you? DON’T JUMP. But you didn’t listen,” he yelled at them while they were still weeping.

“If you guys keep ignoring my instructions from now on, I won’t pick you up!” he warned them.

Uninterested, I started to look outside. ‘I'm going to be so late,’ I thought to myself as I remembered the last time the driver was scolding another child. He got so caught up in it that he only stopped when my mother called, worried about where we were.

The view outside was not exactly picturesque. It was a semi-busy road. I remember seeing cars passing by the van and staring at the van before driving past us. The stares made me feel very uncomfortable as if I was part of some crime scene. Thus, I began looking at the pavement.

It was even more uncomfortable. The pedestrians and bystanders gave weirder and longer stares. But I got used to it. One, in particular, caught my eye: a fancy grocery store. It was unusually large and well-maintained, a rarity in those days.

Then, things took a strange turn. I started to feel a weird commotion as if something was approaching. When I glanced at the bystanders who had been staring at us for all this duration, they were now staring in front. Their reactions were alarming. I could hear some faint screams and fast footsteps. All the people I laid my eyes on were looking in the same direction. I was really confused. I knew something was wrong, and I shouldn’t have been looking in that direction, but I was fascinated.

And then it happened... This is your content warning. If you don’t want to read graphic content, then you can skip the following chunk, which is written in *italics*. I will provide a less graphic description after it.

≥≠=======≠≤

*I saw a strong-looking young man limping towards us. His back was very stiff, and his arms were flopping. He was almost naked, with just a white towel wrapped around his waist. When our eyes met, I realized he was oddly shrinking in size as if something was squeezing him.*

*The towel around his waist began turning red, and tiny bubbles of blood appeared on his skin. He was entirely covered in a froth of blood in a matter of seconds. I remember him collapsing on his knees as I screamed to call the driver. The driver glanced at me and almost instantly noticed the man. He quickly closed the middle door, rushed towards his seat, and tried to start the van. The van did not start. “The servicing,” I thought.*

*So, I was stuck in the front-row seat to witness a gruesome and agonizing death.*

*I just could not look away. He had no visible cuts or bruises on his body. Yet, the blood sort of phased out of his skin, bubbling to the surface. The bubbles merged into larger ones before bursting, creating pools of blood that spread across the pavement and spilled onto the road.*

*He lost all of his bodily fluids, and his muscles shrunk to his bones. Except his mouth, his face was nearly indistinguishable, completely covered by a thick layer of blood froth. I recall his lips moving as if he was trying to speak, and I tried to make out the words. I couldn't decipher anything he said except the very last thing before he collapsed face-first onto the sidewalk: ""Help me.""*

*Tried to convince the driver to help him, at least call an ambulance, but he ignored my plea. I even tried to get out of the car to help, but my side of the door was child-locked.*

*For the entire time for which we were stuck there, no one rushed to help the man.*

≥≠=======≠≤

For those who skipped, here is the crux:- A man died a very horrifying borderline paranormal death, but no one intervened. Even the van driver. I was trapped in the van, helplessly watching as it unfolded.

Soon, the van started, and the last image I recall of the man was him lying on the sidewalk, lifeless and unattended, as the tires of the van rolled over his remains on the road.

The van was painfully quiet. I remember my eyes locked on the driver for almost the entire way home. Waiting for him to speak, to say anything. But he stayed silent, his gaze fixed on the road.

Instead of Timothy, the driver decided to drop me off first. When we reached my stop, the sound of his door slamming broke the unbearable silence. He rushed towards my door and opened it.

I got out of the van without making any eye contact with him. I hurried towards my home, overwhelmed with emotions. Then he said something.

“There was no saving him.”

I stopped. Part of me wanted to turn around, to argue, to tell him he was wrong. But a deeper part of me knew he was right. After a few moments of contemplation, I resumed walking and reached the door.

“I’m working on a case, Ray. The food on the table. I’ll join you soon,” my father said, turning back just as I stepped through the doorway.

I threw my bag on my bed and headed to take a bath. I turned on the shower and started to sob. I didn’t want my father to know what had happened. I thought that he already had a lot of things to take care of and I should not bother him with this incident.

Looking back, I regret not opening up properly. I had started to suppress my emotions and tried to act like an adult. It all started with my mother’s death. I was overwhelmed with grief when she died, but I never had anyone to share my grief with. No siblings. No close relatives. No friends. No one. So, I tried my best to act like an “adult” all my childhood. To keep my feelings and emotions locked behind an unassuming face.

Anyway, after crying my lungs out in the shower, I came out looking for my father and saw that he had locked his room’s door. So, I ate lunch alone, left him a note on the fridge in case he came out, and decided to go ride my bike.

I met Timothy and Ava at a park in our neighborhood. Some things happened at the park which I can’t recall. I guess I have a faint memory of Ava beating the shit out of Timothy. Maybe, but it used to happen quite often, so I might be misremembering.

But I am sure both of them were pissed off at each other. I was really confused seeing them fight and asked.

“Why are you two fighting?”  
They responded and said it was because of the van incident.

“If you guys were so bothered, then why didn’t you guys help me convince the driver to stop the van and help the man?”

Both of them gave me a confused look. Turns out they were in so much pain that they didn’t notice anything off. It was incomprehensible to me that something like this was even possible. And Timothy agreed.

“Stop lying, Ray,” Timothy said.  
“Why will I lie? What will I get by lying?”

“I don’t know, you tell us,” Timothy said.  
“I’m not lying! We can go back to the spot where it happened and ask the people there about it. ”

Surprisingly, Timothy agreed to the idea almost immediately, while Ava was against it. It was strange—it’s usually the other way around. Ava explained the ways of reaching the location and pointed out potential issues.

There were two routes to the location. The fastest way from the park was to head east toward the Community Hall, to the roundabout, and to the road where the incident occurred. But taking that route meant cycling past my house. If my dad saw me riding my bike on the main road, he’d likely ban me from cycling altogether. It was unlikely that he would see us but he had caught us the last time we tried. I was banned for a week.

So, we had to take the other way. Not only was this path longer, but to reach the location, we would have had to ride along the trolley line.

Ages ago, a trolley system was installed in our area. However, with the advent of buses and other transportation mediums, this system became defunct. The only remnants of this system are the trolley lines. The majority of these lines have disappeared or are withered beyond recognition, except for the line we had to cycle along to reach the location.

This particular line begins a few blocks from the park and ends just before the site of the incident. It’s about a mile long and shows no signs of age. No rust. No cracks. Nothing. Naturally, it’s become a local legend.

Some say that it doesn’t age because it ‘repairs’ itself by killing babies in the womb; thus, pregnant women are ‘strongly’ advised not to come even close to this trolley line. Many people disagree with this legend and state that it kills dogs or cats instead of babies; thus, their version of the legend states that no one should come near the trolley with a pet. Some even say both are wrong, and the trolley line is on top of a temple or a burial ground. Thus, it doesn’t age as it is cursed.

But everyone, including me, agrees that there is something off about this line. In all the houses in the neighborhood, there is at least one unpleasant tale that features the trolley line. And unfortunately, these ‘legends’ have some level of authenticity to them.

So, when Ava pointed out that we would have to cycle alongside the trolley line, we were not as enthusiastic as before.

Ava straight-up said no. She said that we could certainly find out whether I was lying by just asking the driver the day after. Timothy, on the other hand, really wanted to go but was hesitant about biking near the trolley line. He tried convincing us to stick to the usual route, speeding past my house so my dad wouldn’t see us.

I was really conflicted. I wanted to go to the location but didn’t want my father to see where I was going, nor did I want to cycle next to the trolley line. So, I agreed with Ava and decided just to ask the driver to tell them about the incident. That would prove to them that I was not lying. But things didn’t go the way I expected them to go.

I don’t remember much after I left the park. The rest of the day was fine, I guess.

The next day, I woke up early again and left for school. I also don’t remember anything about going to school or anything that happened at school. But after school got over, I remember sitting in the middle section of the van and waiting till it was just the three and the driver. I asked him to tell them about the incident, and his reply was, “What incident?”. I tried to remind him and shared all the details, but he just stared at me with a blank face.

I was genuinely stunned. I began to contemplate my existence as Timothy started to call me a liar and was laughing at me hysterically. Oddly, Ava was actively trying to change the topic and divert our attention. I remember staring at the driver for a very long time and him again not trying to make any eye contact with me.

After that, things get a bit foggy. I have faint memories of getting out of the van and having lunch with my father. He could feel something was wrong, but he didn’t pressure me to tell me what had happened.

But I vividly remember that he got a call from the van driver. On the call, the driver informed him that he could no longer pick me up or drop me off at my home. When my father asked him why, the driver said that his van had broken down and he had replaced it with a new one that could only accommodate a maximum of six kids. Before hanging up, the driver gave my father contact info for the new driver who would from tomorrow come and pick me up. The driver also shared that Timothy is also getting shifted with me.

This sudden call slightly weirded out my father, but he didn’t think much about it. I, on the other hand, was freaking out with everything which was happening. I remember that after my father had gone inside his office/room, I left the home without even leaving a note on the fridge.

The next thing I recall is riding my bike next to the trolley line. Alone. The thoughts of the dead man consumed me. I had to prove to myself that I was not hallucinating him. I cycled at an alarmingly high speed towards the location of the incident.

When I reached the location, there was no blood on the road or on the pavement where I last remembered the man. Then, I rushed inside the fancy grocery store and asked the cashier if he had heard about a man who had recently died next to the store. I gave him all the details but didn’t tell him I was there. Instead, I told him that I had overheard about it on the street.

“Well, let me tell you, kid, nothing like that happened here. I wish it had; honestly, ‘cause at least the mass hysterical created by this... ‘Sponge-Man’ would’ve brought more customers like you to the shop. And kid, word of advice: don’t believe what randos say in public. Most of them have no idea or control over what they say. Now that we’re clear on that, how ‘bout you pick something up from the shop?”

The shopkeeper was very persuasive and made me buy a Yoohoo with my allowance. After I left the shop, I was convinced that somehow I had dreamt about the entire man and the incident. I got back on my bike to head home. The trolley tracks were empty, but out of nowhere, a black car came speeding up behind me and slammed into my bike, throwing me several feet forward.

I was heavily bruised, and my eyes were teary. My body was overall fine, but I had a little concussion. When my mind started to work properly, I remember the black car standing next to me with its window down. The car driver looked at me from top to bottom and asked me, “Are you okay?”

I don’t know why, but I nodded.

“You should be more careful, kid; navigating this world of adults ain’t easy.” the driver said in a very passive-aggressive tone before driving away. I don’t recall any physical features of the man.

There was no one in the surroundings to help me, so I had to help myself. It took me more than ten minutes to process what had happened and resume riding back home. When I got back, my father was not in his office; he was in the living room waiting for me.

I remember him washing my wounds with an antiseptic while scolding me for leaving without a note and ‘crashing my bike in a pole.’ He didn’t take any disciplinary action, but he still restricted my cycle time.

And after that, nothing really interesting happened. I started to go to school in a new van with Timothy, where we made new friends. We slowly started to get much closer to them, and our friendship with Ava just sort of broke. The last time I remember having fun with her was at my ninth birthday party. She didn’t even call when Timothy died last year... And this is the reason why I have started to investigate this case.

For a very long time, I tried my best to convince myself that my mind was just playing tricks on me. But as I grew older, I started to notice suspicious things that happened that my younger self didn’t realize.

●  Ava acting strange(not wanting to go to the location of the incident, not making fun of me when I was proven ’wrong’, and actively trying to change the topic).

●  The driver acting strange(saying, “What incident?” and then kicking me and Timothy out of the van but not Ava).

●  the shopkeeper(I don’t recall anything suspicious, but he was really good with words).

●  And the black car driver(crashing into my cycle on an empty road, the passive-aggressive statement).

I have lost countless hours thinking about this case ever since Timothy died, and the more that I think about it, the more convinced I am that something really happened.

I am currently trying to get in contact with Ava and the driver. I will make subsequent posts updating you guys on this case.

I don’t know who the dead man was. I don’t know if he was good or bad. Heck, I am not even 100% sure that he is real.

But I do know that he is not the only person to suffer that horrid fate... Timothy suffered that same fate, too.

I'm trying to narrow down which espresso machine and grinder to choose for our small cafe. We are currently looking at two group machines. Budget is listed at $35k but above or below is okay. We have a service company just down the road for us and we will likely be purchasing or ordering a machine from them.

A few options listed by them are:

\-Simonelli Life 2 Group Full Size or Compact  
\-La Marzocco Linea, GB5 and Strada  
\-Victoria Arduino White Eagle (currently in their showroom)

Grinder options are: Simonelli MDX-S, Mahlkonig E65 and Mahlkonig E80

Can anyone give some recommendations of machines they like? Maybe top 3 choices. Price point is probably not that important if the machine is worth it.

I know the coffee world quite well but not so much the espresso side, but I want to do it right and have a great setup.

1h7eidp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h7eidp,My parents almost set my newborn baby on fire and my mom wants me to apologize for being upset about it,"Days before Thanksgiving, my husband asked my mom if she could watch the kids on Thanksgiving so we could host. She said no and that she would host. We wanted to host for good reasons - as you’ll see in these texts.

My parents have a 10 month old, untrained, aggressive half German shepherd half pit mix. I didn’t want to have my 2 year old and 3 month old over for that alone. That said, we were so overwhelmed that we wouldn’t have been able to host Thanksgiving without someone watching the kids, so going to my parents house was the next best option. I’ve told my mom repeatedly I am not comfortable with her dog around my kids.

On the day of Thanksgiving, my dad greets us at the door, which is at the bottom of the stairwell. My parents have a split level/raised ranch. The dog instantly jumps out at me and my kids. My dad offers to take the baby, who I’m holding in his Nuna carseat.

My dad had been drinking since the morning, as he does on holidays, and brings my baby up. I walk upstairs and get settled in with my husband and toddler. Suddenly, everyone smells burning and my baby starts crying. **His fucking car seat with him in it caught on fire**. How? My dad placed him on a **coffee table** next to a **lit candle**.

Why did my mom have lit candles within reach of a toddler to begin with? I can’t answer that.

We left pretty immediately after that, didn’t get to talk to my sister or anything. No apology from my parents, just my mom putting out the fire hurriedly and making sure my baby was okay.

We didn’t talk for a few days, then she sent me a message about the dog chewing up the furniture like I give a fuck after they almost burnt my newborn baby. I tried to call her to tell her how I felt. The following texts ensued.

I really don’t care if you think I come across as an asshole here. This has been a long time coming. I was willing to overlook all the childhood stuff for the sake of my kids. Now that they’ve endangered one of them this is no longer feasible.",41,1733419559.0,EstrangedAdultChild,21,0.96,False

My husband recently got me a Breville Barista Express for our anniversary. So far the machine has been great- but definitely a learning process.

The big issue we are having lately is that in the morning, I make my husbands coffee first and his turns out just fine- but when I try to make mine a couple minutes later I will get a few drops of water in a shotglass and nothing else- the only thing that seems to help is doing a lot less grinds in my portafilter but I don't understand why it works fine with 18g when I make my husbands, but immediately after needs to be adjusted for my coffee.

So far we have tried manually changing the grind size to courser (the part inside the machine itself, under where the beans are stored) which helped for a while but ultimately led to the same issue. I have tried both finer and courser on the dial itself which does not seem to help. I have cleaned every piece of the machine several times in case of blockage, and vacuumed out the bean hopper several times. Like I said, the only thing that helps is if I do less than 18g in my portafilter but then the shot has a different flavor/is more watered down than I want. I know that my tamping technique is definitely not the best but adjusting that hasn't seemed to help either.

This is most definitely user error, but I'm just not advanced enough and I don't have any more ideas. Any advice?",1,1733419383.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

My mother (73) is horrible with finances and as a result, has a trash credit score. Due to her credit score being so low, her home insurance premium was raised as she is ""a risk"". Recently, she asked me if I could add her to a few of my credit cards to help increase her score. I was hesitant but she made it clear she didn't want the physical cards (not that I would have given them to her), she didn't want anything to do with them other than being listed and hoping it would raise her credit. I agreed and told her I would add her to 2 separate cards with one having a 6.5k limit and the other a 10.5k limit, I told her they get used but always well below the 30% utilization each month. The smaller limit one is used for 2 or 3 autocharges and never has more than a $50 balance and the other is my personal ""fun use"" card for purchases that are solely mine and don't get put on the cards I share with my husband (think nail polish or pedicures). On that card it it rarely goes over $300 but I try to pay the balance as soon as it posts and before the cycle closes. Recently I made a lot of personal expenses on my card for Christmas presents and splurged and bought a coffee machine I've been eyeing for $500. With all the expenses there was a balance of 1k and the charges posted the day after my statement closed. My mother got an alert on her credit that a balance increased on one of her cards and when she looked she realized it was mine. I think her score may have dropped by a point if anything at all and she called me up asking what I bought to have such a balance. I politely told her don't worry about it, I already paid it off and when the statement closes again her score will reflect that but it will take a month. She again asked what I bought and I told her just some gifts but she was persistent. I kept refusing to tell her because quite frankly, it's none of her business and told her as much. She did not like that answer. Once I was off the phone with her I went ahead and removed her from my cards. I'm a private person, I don't like to be questioned over my choices and didn't really want to add her on in the first place. A few weeks later she called me up yelling and screaming because her credit dropped about 20 points after I took her off. Both cards were long standing over 10 years old and again, low utilization, the high limits also helped her credit score.

It seems that I have become the fault for every each and every little problem that appears in his life. He blames me for every little thing. Most of his anger seems to be centralized around me not doing things the way he would do things and his dog being naughty.

For example, we went to see a movie the other night and had a fantastic date night, but the second we got home, he noticed the dog had pushed past a gate that we keep up around the cat food to keep the dog from eating it, and the dog had eaten the cat food. He blamed me and screamed at me for 15 mins about how it was my fault because ""the dog never does stuff like this when I'm here"" but we were both at the movie together. Today, I popped out of the house to get a coffee and came back to him blaming me for the dog jumping on the couch while I wasn't home. Again, I don't see how I can control the dog's actions while I'm not home. ITS NOT EVEN MY DOG. I DIDN'T WANT A DOG. HE IS THE ONE WHO GOT THE DOG WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. Yet, anything the dog does wrong is my fault. A few days before thanksgiving we were hanging out with his family when he yelled at the dog so harshly that his family all felt super uncomfortable with his brunt and fear inducing outbursts. 

Besides the dog, he also screams at me for not ""upholding my end of the chores in the house."" He gets made at me for working all day (9-6 remote) and not doing chores with him during the day (he does not have a job rn as he was laid off), however, I still do all the grocery shopping, cooking, and cleaning the kitchen, while he does the yard work, laundry, and pet care. 

On Thanksgiving, I made my first turkey ever. I was injecting the turkey with butter when he screamed at me for making a mess because the butter squirted a little onto the counter. I immediately cleaned it up, but the thought of anything being slightly messy seems to put him into a rage. 

All to say, I don't know what to do anymore. I try to talk to him about it but just get cold-shouldered for days straight. We don't have health insurance so he can't even seek help if he wanted to (not that he would.) I feel as though he is sick and tired of me for things beyond my control. Please advise anything other than divorce, because I don't feel as though we are past the tipping point yet.

This results in me hardly ever feeling comfortable(do u guys feel this way too bc it sucks) i’m always sweaty and cold with swollen hands which i think are so ugly btw. Makes me feel insecure af.

The Cautionary Tale of Casey Coward

Casey Coward lived a life of unshakable certainty. The kind of person who bought extended warranties for socks and refused to jaywalk even when the street was empty. Risk? Casey didn’t even spell the word out loud.

One crisp morning, Casey’s best friend, Alex, burst into the coffee shop they always frequented. “Casey! I’ve got it. The opportunity of a lifetime.”

Casey squinted over their triple-checked latte (extra foam, but not too much). “Does this involve heights? Or spicy food? Or crowds? You know I don’t do—”

“None of that!” Alex waved a hand. “It’s a business idea. Simple. Clean. Genius.”

Alex explained the plan: a subscription service for custom pet portraits made by AI. “It’s niche, but people are obsessed with their pets. We’ll start small. I just need a little cash to help with marketing. I’m putting in $5,000. I’m asking you to match it.”

Casey’s heart skipped a beat. “$5,000?!” They clutched their latte as if Alex might snatch it to fund this wild endeavor. “What if it doesn’t work? What if people don’t like it? What if AI art gets banned? What if—”

“Casey.” Alex leaned in, locking eyes. “It’s a calculated risk. Low buy-in, high potential. And you know I’ve thought it through. When have I ever let you down?”

Casey fidgeted with a napkin. “It just… sounds risky.”

“Yeah,” Alex said, “but it’s also the chance to do something big. To be part of something. You always say you want that, right?”

Casey nodded vaguely but couldn’t shake the fear. After a long pause, they sighed. “I’m sorry. I can’t.”

Six months later, Alex came back to the coffee shop, grinning from ear to ear.

“Guess who just made half a million dollars?” Alex slid their phone across the table, a photo of their shiny new sports car glowing on the screen. “The pet portrait thing took off. People are nuts about it. We’ve got celebrity endorsements, a deal with a national pet store chain, and—get this—we just signed with Shark Tank for a second round of funding!”

Casey stared at the phone. “Half a million?”

“Yup. And that’s just phase one. We’re expanding into custom videos and merch.”

Casey’s stomach sank. “I… I could’ve been part of this.”

“Yeah, you could’ve,” Alex said, not unkindly. “But hey, you’ll get the friends-and-family discount on a pet portrait. That’s something, right?”

Casey tried to laugh, but it came out as a croak. They thought of the $5,000 sitting safely in their savings account, untouched. It had earned maybe $17 in interest over the past six months.

Over the next few years, Alex’s success story grew into a legend. Interviews. Podcasts. A viral TikTok with Oprah holding a watercolor portrait of her golden retriever. Meanwhile, Casey stayed in their comfort zone, a place lined with safety nets and regrets.

Every now and then, they’d open Alex’s Instagram—photos of yachts, exotic vacations, and Alex’s grinning face holding a champagne glass—and wonder: What if I’d just taken that one tiny risk?

But it was too late. The only thing Casey ever invested in again was an extended warranty for a blender they barely used.

And if you ask Casey about that business idea, they’ll shrug and say, “It was probably too risky anyway.” But late at night, as they scroll through Alex’s latest post, they whisper to themselves, “I could’ve been somebody. All this because of one bull shit ass day. ”

Moral of the story is. Don’t be a coward. Buy BSAD today. ",2,1733417931.0,BSADay,0,1.0,False

I love these tips he sent in his newsletter today and wanted to share:

* **(1) TV Hung Too High.** This never looks good and hurts to look at, so unless putting a TV above the fireplace is your ONLY option, don’t.
* **(2) Rug Too Small.** Your rug should not be a tiny post-it note in the middle of the room. The front two legs of all furniture items, if not all four, should be on the rug.
* **(3) No Surfaces For Drinks.** Not having a place to put drinks, food, or your phone will annoy you and any guests you have over. Ensure that every seat has access to either the coffee table or some sort of console or side table.
* **(4) TV Is Bigger Than Media Console.** My pet peeve is when a TV is comically larger than the media it sits on. Your TV should be about 2/3 the width of the media console.
* **(5) Your Furniture Is Pushed Up Against The Wall OR Not Facing Other.** Although we might not always think about it, the living room’s primary function is for conversation. So when your furniture is awkwardly placed, or there’s a large amount of space between everyone, your living room will look wrong and probably feel “off.""
* **(6) Mismatched Lighting Temperatures.** This is a hard and fast rule for any room in your home. The lighting temperatures should always match; if you want to go cool-toned, make sure all of your lighting is cool-toned. But I recommend sticking to the 4000K-2000K range.
* **(7) You Lack Personal Touches.** Your home should feel like you, not an IKEA showroom. Make sure to add photos of friends and family, little momentos and knickknacks from adventures, and special pieces you really love.
* **(8) Missing Wall Texture.** If you’ve got plain, bland walls, try adding texture through wallpaper, mouldings, art, or curtains. There’s a wide array of options at different price points, so there’s really no excuse.
* **(9) You’re Forgetting About Smell: Good And Bad.** Don’t let things get stinky; ensure you’re cleaning regularly (especially if you have pets or an open-concept kitchen-living room). But also make sure you add in pleasant smells with fresh flowers, candles, and diffusers.
* **(10) You Don’t Like Your Furniture, Or It’s Uncomfortable.** You might think your living room looks fine but can't figure out why you hate it. Maybe you’ve got a stiff couch, or maybe that armchair reminds you of your ex. Either way, think about replacing pieces that aren’t serving you anymore.",3,1733417924.0,interiordecorating,2,1.0,False

I got this aforementioned machine last week and have since been trying to make some nice shots at home with it, but I am coming up against a consistent issue. The first being that I keep getting the 3 flashing beans error which supposedly means that I dont have enough beans in the hopper. This is obviously false as I've added enough beans for a few shots, so the hopper is full, though I'm wondering if maybe I should only put in as many beans as I need per shot? Secondly, and I'm assuming this could be a direct result of the error or whatever is causing it, my shots are coming out very watery. It basically just tastes like coffee. There's no thickness and no foam. I know that these types of machines need a ""breaking in"" period, but I've made probably 13 or 14 shots by now so I'm just wondering when that period might be over?

I matched with a Thai girl on Tinder in Bangkok and then within few messages she asked for my LINE and then within 5 minutes she asked if I could order Grab Taxi for her so she can come to my hotel for sex. Do you think it's a scam? Maybe someone would come with her and try to rob me? It just sounds too good and too easy to be true.
Or maybe she would ask me for money after sex? 
I offered to meet in a busy coffee shop first and she agreed but then I got a bit afraid it might be a scam and said I can't meet up. 


It was even more suspicious because she told me she has boyfriend living in the US, and he didn't see her for 5 months so she didn't have sex for 5 months and then she also asked me if I could take a video while she gives me a blowjob so that she can rewatch that video when she feels horny. 

That's another reason why I couldn't do that but do you think it's a scam? ",0,1733417811.0,ThailandTourism,21,0.4,False

The Cautionary Tale of Casey Coward

Casey Coward lived a life of unshakable certainty. The kind of person who bought extended warranties for socks and refused to jaywalk even when the street was empty. Risk? Casey didn’t even spell the word out loud.

One crisp morning, Casey’s best friend, Alex, burst into the coffee shop they always frequented. “Casey! I’ve got it. The opportunity of a lifetime.”

Casey squinted over their triple-checked latte (extra foam, but not too much). “Does this involve heights? Or spicy food? Or crowds? You know I don’t do—”

“None of that!” Alex waved a hand. “It’s a business idea. Simple. Clean. Genius.”

Alex explained the plan: a subscription service for custom pet portraits made by AI. “It’s niche, but people are obsessed with their pets. We’ll start small. I just need a little cash to help with marketing. I’m putting in $5,000. I’m asking you to match it.”

Casey’s heart skipped a beat. “$5,000?!” They clutched their latte as if Alex might snatch it to fund this wild endeavor. “What if it doesn’t work? What if people don’t like it? What if AI art gets banned? What if—”

“Casey.” Alex leaned in, locking eyes. “It’s a calculated risk. Low buy-in, high potential. And you know I’ve thought it through. When have I ever let you down?”

Casey fidgeted with a napkin. “It just… sounds risky.”

“Yeah,” Alex said, “but it’s also the chance to do something big. To be part of something. You always say you want that, right?”

Casey nodded vaguely but couldn’t shake the fear. After a long pause, they sighed. “I’m sorry. I can’t.”

Six months later, Alex came back to the coffee shop, grinning from ear to ear.

“Guess who just made half a million dollars?” Alex slid their phone across the table, a photo of their shiny new sports car glowing on the screen. “The pet portrait thing took off. People are nuts about it. We’ve got celebrity endorsements, a deal with a national pet store chain, and—get this—we just signed with Shark Tank for a second round of funding!”

Casey stared at the phone. “Half a million?”

“Yup. And that’s just phase one. We’re expanding into custom videos and merch.”

Casey’s stomach sank. “I… I could’ve been part of this.”

“Yeah, you could’ve,” Alex said, not unkindly. “But hey, you’ll get the friends-and-family discount on a pet portrait. That’s something, right?”

Casey tried to laugh, but it came out as a croak. They thought of the $5,000 sitting safely in their savings account, untouched. It had earned maybe $17 in interest over the past six months.

Over the next few years, Alex’s success story grew into a legend. Interviews. Podcasts. A viral TikTok with Oprah holding a watercolor portrait of her golden retriever. Meanwhile, Casey stayed in their comfort zone, a place lined with safety nets and regrets.

Every now and then, they’d open Alex’s Instagram—photos of yachts, exotic vacations, and Alex’s grinning face holding a champagne glass—and wonder: What if I’d just taken that one tiny risk?

But it was too late. The only thing Casey ever invested in again was an extended warranty for a blender they barely used.

And if you ask Casey about that business idea, they’ll shrug and say, “It was probably too risky anyway.” But late at night, as they scroll through Alex’s latest post, they whisper to themselves, “I could’ve been somebody. All this because of one bull shit ass day. ”

Moral of the story is. Don’t be a coward. Buy BSAD today. ",1,1733417719.0,SolanaMemeCoins,0,1.0,False

","Hey all, a few weeks ago I messaged someone about a room for rent at a shared house. Before viewing the place I suggested we meet elsewhere first so we met for coffee. It turns out that she's not only beautiful but really cool and we get along very well. We have many of the same experiences, insights, hobbies and interests. We talked about life, relationships, faith, and many other things. I understood her and her me. She mentioned how she was going on a few dates (unprompted) but doesn't think it's working for her. After an hour of getting to know each-other we went over to the house and I was really into it so I said I'd move in! (I wasn't crushing at this point.. just excited). Then I went home and didn't talk for a day or two.

Well, because I enjoyed her company so much and I was also hungry, I suggested we meet to sign the documents over dinner. She enthusiastically agreed and when she showed up she gave me a hug. Again our conversations flowed smoothly and we had a lot of fun. I signed the documents and, paid for my entre and appetizer, gave her a hug back then left.

Fast forward a few days, I showed up on the 1st to drop some of my stuff off, and we ended up talking for another hour at the table. She shared an incredible amount of information about herself and I just listened and asked questions. I find myself really enjoying listening to her speak, the conversations flow and feel really natural, not forced at all. However she brought up the fact that she skipped out on one of her dates because she wasn't feeling up to it, and that she's going on a 4th date with someone else soon. But then followed that up with the fact that she doesn't like forcing a relationship, that she'd prefer it evolve naturally.

Anyways.. I asked her to breakfast the next morning and again she enthusiastically agreed. We both had to leave so I gave her a hug but this time a big tighter and longer and when we let go I noticed she brushed my arm instead of just releasing. We went for breakfast and she insisted on paying - alright. Then we went to the park to walk her dog and parted ways with another hug.

So, my issue is... I'm moving in this month, I have 2 leases so I'm still staying at my old place. But now I don't know what to do!!! I have developed a killer crush on this woman and I'm moving in. I want to tell her that I want to take her on a date because I can see some serious potential with this person, but then I also don't want to make the living situation weird. Alternatively, living together might give us an opportunity to develop a really good relationship based on trust and rapport. But part of me wants to back out of the whole thing which will also be an expensive move.

There's clearly chemistry and I doubt I'm going to be able to help myself from flirting with her. I have serious interest in her as a person and could see myself dating her especially since we've done a bunch of stuff together. I'm seriously conflicted and would like other people's thoughts on this.

Thank-you so much ;\_;

My husband recently got me a Breville Barista Express for our anniversary. So far the machine has been great- but definitely a learning process.

The big issue we are having lately is that in the morning, I make my husbands coffee first and his turns out just fine- but when I try to make mine a couple minutes later I will get a few drops of water in a shotglass and nothing else- the only thing that seems to help is doing a lot less grinds in my portafilter but I don't understand why it works fine with 18g when I make my husbands, but immediately after needs to be adjusted for my coffee.

So far we have tried manually changing the grind size to courser (the part inside the machine itself, under where the beans are stored) which helped for a while but ultimately led to the same issue. I have tried both finer and courser on the dial itself which does not seem to help. I have cleaned every piece of the machine several times in case of blockage, and vacuumed out the bean hopper several times. Like I said, the only thing that helps is if I do less than 18g in my portafilter but then the shot has a different flavor/is more watered down than I want.  I know that my tamping technique is definitely not the best but adjusting that hasn't seemed to help either.

This is most definitely user error, but I'm just not advanced enough and I don't have any more ideas. Any advice?",1,1733417550.0,espresso,7,1.0,False

• I spend most of my early mornings drinking coffee outside to brace for my day. 

• My career is a pretty hectic one that takes a lot of critical thinking and understanding complex situations. 

• Because of my career, I’m a pretty simple man on my days off. I enjoy my own company, the ability to appreciate quiet and the outdoors. 

• Most days if I’m not at work, you can find me in the gym or close to a pond fishing. 

• I have some pretty hot takes, the first being that socks absolutely do not belong in bed. Argue your point with me if you will. 

• Craft beer is delicious and I try to find a cool little brewery in every small town I go in. 

• Because of my love for craft beer, see my previous statement about the gym. 

• My love language is 100% making fun of you. If you can’t take it or are gonna take it personal, I’m not the guy for you.

I'll start by saying, I'm not sure if I'm happy...I really do not know lol

Started talking January 2016. Started Dating March 2016, stupidly moved in together May 2016.
Ending 2024 together.


2016-September 2017 as a fresh couple. We ""lived"" on his deceased Grandparents farm. 
Which had a very dark energy roaming.

His father is a cruel moronic narcissistic tard'. Literally, he's probably one of the dumbest old guys with the worst narcissistic personality.
Everything we've done, was never good enough.
Even if our fence line was straighter than what he could do, it would get ripped out and redone.

We've spent our own money on ""fixing/upgrading"" anything on this property because nothing was done right and horses were getting ripped up by the poorly managed property.

I spent early mornings listening to this man slamming the trailer door to be demanded to get up and make coffee and get the day going. Just to sit there and listen to him insult his son and myself because we "" are stupid and can't comprehend f*ck all or do f*ck all peoperly"" 

Daily basis of being insulted.
Yet everything we've done was done better than he's done after destroying what we've created.
----

April 2017, I became pregnant with my first. 
After being told ""It ain't gonna stick anyways""
I started to write a long letter of WHY I do not want this man near or around any child that is in my presence. Which got ripped up and myself being tore down by his wife. 
During the 6 months of being pregnant, suddenly the Randoms in the town would speak their concerns to my mother that she ""needs to get me away from The *Insert Last Name*'s. Which is when the story of elder ass being a Pedo was brought up more than once by different strangers.
And because we started to believe it, that's when elder ass needed to destroy me in any way.

He went around telling the town (whoever believed him) that my family were drug dealers. (Wish that was true, wouldn't of had to live off grid if we did have that money)
Then when no one believed him, he turned the pedophile shit around onto my father...Who isn't!

Come September, his son made it possible for him and I to move the fuck out of there. Which we then got fucked over by a Frenchman on a rent-to-own agreement.

The end of September, my pregnancy abruptly and traumatically ended. Which gave his family a reason to tell anyone who'd believe then that I killed my fetus on purpose to get back at them.....

--------
From 2017-2021 I have absolutely no memories in this time frame. Except for being belittled and insulted by my ""boyfriend"". I don't recall good days of love and affection. 

2022 I became pregnant with my rainbow baby who is alive, well and super healthy. She's about to be 2.

5 months post partum, he told me he fell out of love with me. As I was packing my possessions he tells me he doesn't want me to leave.
6 months post partum, I wanted to be risked.
..He screams at me that he never wants to fuck me.
That I'm disgusting.
7 months post partum he was caught following and liking and full on searching names of naked instagram wheres. 
8 months post partum we took my daughter to a pool for the first time, and he was caught looking at a naked woman in a towel. He eyed her up and down and smirked. I said really, right in front of your family.
Which in reply I get ""I don't give a fuck what you think.""
Left with my daughter after 20 minutes because I felt disgusting.
Which then led me to pack my shit and leave for 4 days before he busted into my parents house just to rage at me that he has all rights to see his daughter.
I agree, but not when you act like that.

Stupid me believed stupid him for saying he wants to make it work, he misses me blah blah blah.
To which I made him go to couples councelling. Which didn't last long because I was being made to look fucking crazy over the naked bitches bullshit.

And now, he's telling me it's in his nature to look.

I'm insecure because I'm mad at him for constantly looking at fake tits telling me i need a boob job.

He's 300 pounds and telling me to work out because he deserves a hot girlfriend.

Tells me on the way to my child's dr. App, that he ""doesn't want a fat girlfriend"" i am not fat...

Last night decided to flip shit out on me because I said I will never compare to a fake bitch on Instagram, and that if that's what he wants to look at then leave my body alone ""don't touch me, don't look at me, don't even talk to me."" 
And because of that i was told that all I do is control his life (he's on his phone from the time he wakes up till bedtime. If it's not his phone, it's the Playstation.
He pays no attention to his child or me. 

The constant ""I'm sorry, I shouldn't of said that last night"" is getting supremely fucking old.
Sorry doesn't even mean the same shit anymore.


I say act right or ill leave, he says there's the door. 
I go to leave and then it's a sob story that he loved me and just says stupid shit. 9 years of the same shit different story.

No money, no job experience for years because I've been at home taking care of his house, our child, and his fucking parents shit.


Now that his mom is in a wheelchair, somehow some reason this woman says to me that he wants to move back to the farm and then I can help.
So I would have to take care of my daughter, an old woman, two homes, all while being degraded by shit men whose priorities are not family.

But now I'm the bitch because I said not happening. 


Not looking for attention. I know what I have, I am happy for what God has given me. 
I've lost myself. You should hear the shit he says when I tell him I don't feel like a person anymore.

F24, 5'3, 64kg
Chronic fatigue syndrome
Fibromyalgia
Recently lost 53lbs 

I have just started my new job at the hospital (occupational therapist) it is quite intense and I feel thrown into the deep end. However I've been enjoying and managing it. 

My mental health has been quite stable for around a year thankfully but today out of nowhere, I've had the worst anxiety. 

I had to keep soothing myself and deep breathing, I managed to eat lunch and had a coffee. I went to treat a patient and had to excuse myself. I walked out and dropped to the floor. I just remember people talking to me and I couldn't respond but my eyes were open. I was hearing things in slow motion.

I have no clue why this happened. I felt nauseous, then dizzy and everything went black. I couldn't get any words out. The nurse said my blood pressure was low when she checked it and gave me a sugary drink. 

I eventually got up but was very shaky. I came home, it's been several hours since then and the anxiety just has not left. Do I need to see a doctor? Or shall I just see how I am.

They were wheeling me to emergency room but I told them I'm fine and want to go home. I didn't fancy spending 10 hours in A&E for fainting.

So that's the first time I've been tempted to poke my tongue out and taste the soap.  Really love the scent, mostly coffee, good coffee at that but definitely the hint of whiskey you'd expect too.  If I thought it was safe I'd put that shit in my coffee fr.  Lathers really thick, needed a bit more water and work than my RR or Prorasos but the scent is so good.  The shave itself was fine.  Dorco in the GC is comfortable enough, I still think Derby Premium has been the best combo so far.  The Royal was the exact opposite of the Irish Coffee in that it didn't at all smell like what the name implied, at least to me.  But that's not a bad thing.  I guess I'm not sure what I expected it to smell like, but it smells like shop class.  Memories of using the band saw, welding, sweeping up sawdust.  Strong and pleasant.  I can still feel it on my face a couple hours post shave, but I was probably a little heavy handed with it.  Overall a lovely experience start to finish.",7,1733417221.0,wicked_edge,4,0.9,False

I bought my first home about 8 years ago and absolutely love it. I also have the ability to work from home quite a bit which makes it even more enjoyable but that’s starting to get sour with the amount of times my father will randomly drop in. He’s retired and may be bored but he’ll at least pop by unannounced once a week, sometimes even 3-4 times a week. I love my dad and overall we have a decent relationship but all these random drop ins are starting to build anger towards him. 

I’ve had a chat multiple times with him about calling ahead or texting, he says he understands, follows it for a bit then reverts back to just popping by. There’s even times I would come home from work and he’ll have my garage open or he’ll be trying to store something in my shed. It’s at the point where even if he texts first for a coffee, I’m so drained and infuriated from the weekly ins that I say no to coffee, but he’ll still pop by 3-4 hours later. 

This has happened A LOT to say the least. It will happen during work meetings, if me and the gal are hanging out or even if I’m just high out of my mind trying to watch a movie. There’s been times I’ve even shown anger towards this and gave him some attitude, then he’ll kind of get pouty so I feel bad about it. Again, I love my father and he’s done a lot for me but he continues to ignore the boundary I try to set. Has anyone dealt with this before? There’s been times I don’t even answer the door and just say I was showering or whatever, but it feels like it’s not even my house with the amount of pop ins I get.

A friend of mine has had the De’Longhi TrueBrew for almost a year. I'm a coffee snob, but with fresh beans, l've been pleasantly surprised! It's been a reliable unit for pulling multiple cups a day, and he could not be happier with his purchase.

Back to the office, a co-worker said she looked at a commercial bean to cup unit a few years ago that cost over $10k, and that was shot down. There are better options to consider now from from $1k to $5k like the Bunn 44300, KitchenAid KF8, Dr. Coffee F11…

However, jumping from the K-Cups to a TrueBrew seems like a huge upgrade in coffee quality, sustainability and incredible bang for buck. It’s currently $355 on Amazon.

You found an old trade-thread by me? The ""Have"" and ""Want"" lists over there, are probably not up-to-date anymore then. Make sure you check the newest version. The old ones should be tagged as ""closed"" by now.

I consider the cheapest current available prices from keyshops (or running Steam Sales, if Steam should be the cheapest for once) for games, to determine their value. I don't consider the overpriced keyshop prices for games from bundles, when the cheaper bundle is **still running**. For those games, we have to agree on something between us. Also have in mind, I am from EU, thus, I won't consider your (potentially cheaper) regional Steam Shop prices - I can only consider EU or US prices to determine value. Sometimes (but this is not the norm) I will even do trades in your favour, if the price/value gap is not too big in my eyes, based on the kind of games we trade. I use traded games for myself.

---------------------------------------------------------

Water fasting, especially for five days, is a process that has gained attention for its potential health benefits. Many people are curious about its effects on the body and mind. If you're considering this journey, here are some vital benefits you might experience.

### Detoxification

One of the most touted benefits of a 5 day water fast is detoxification. When you stop consuming solid foods, your body gets a chance to focus on eliminating toxins. This is because the digestive system is given a rest, allowing other organs, particularly the liver and kidneys, to flush out accumulated waste products. During a water fast, you may notice changes in your skin and energy levels, which can be signs of effective detox.

### Weight Loss

A 5 day water fast can lead to significant weight loss. When you consume only water, your body begins to use stored fat for energy. This can result in rapid weight loss, making it an attractive option for those looking to shed pounds. However, it’s essential to remember that this weight loss may not be sustainable long-term and should be part of a larger health plan.

### Enhanced Mental Clarity

Many who undergo a water fast report improved focus and mental clarity. Without the distractions of processed foods and sugars, your brain can perform better. This effect may result from ketogenesis, where your body uses fat as its primary energy source, producing ketones that are beneficial for brain function.

### Improved Insulin Sensitivity

One significant benefit of fasting is improved insulin sensitivity. When you regularly consume food, especially carbohydrates, your insulin levels can spike. By fasting, you lower your insulin levels, giving your body a chance to reset. This could be particularly beneficial for people with insulin resistance or diabetes.

### Cellular Regeneration

Fasting supports a process called autophagy, which helps your body regenerate cells. This natural process allows cells to remove damaged components. A five-day water fast can kickstart this regenerative process, leading to better overall health. Enhanced cell function improves vitality and longevity.

### Reduced Inflammation

Chronic inflammation is linked to many health issues, including heart disease and autoimmune disorders. During a water fast, markers of inflammation in the body can decrease significantly. This reduction helps relieve symptoms of chronic conditions and promotes overall health and well-being.

### Improved Digestive Health

Since a five-day water fast gives your digestive system a break, many people experience improvements in digestive health. After resuming food intake, the gut can often function more efficiently. You might find that issues such as bloating and indigestion lessen after a fasting period.

### Spiritual and Emotional Benefits

The benefits of a five-day water fast aren't just physical. Many participants find that it provides emotional and spiritual benefits, too. The act of fasting can foster a sense of discipline and bring clarity to personal goals. Additionally, it can serve as a reset for your relationship with food, making you more mindful of what you eat once the fast is over.

### Important Considerations

Before starting a five-day water fast, it’s essential to consult a healthcare professional. While many people can safely complete a short water fast, it’s not suitable for everyone, particularly those with certain health conditions. It’s also crucial to prepare your body and mind for the fast and to ease back into eating after the fasting period ends.

- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water throughout the fast.
- **Listen to Your Body:** If you feel unwell, consider breaking the fast.
- **Plan Your Refeed:** After fasting, start slow with light foods.

The benefits of a 5 day water fast can be impressive, ranging from detoxification and weight loss to improved mental clarity and overall health. However, as with any significant dietary change, it's essential to approach this journey with proper guidance and care.

How a 5 Day Water Fast Can Boost Mental Clarity
-----------------------------------------------

Many people are exploring methods to enhance their mental clarity, and one intriguing approach is a 5-day water fast. This practice involves consuming only water for five consecutive days, leading to various potential benefits for both body and mind. If you're curious about how this fasting method can boost your mental clarity, read on to discover the key advantages.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Improved Focus and Concentration

One of the first benefits you might notice during a 5-day water fast is improved focus and concentration. When you stop consuming solid food, your body shifts into a different metabolic state. This adaptation can lead to increased levels of ketones, which are known to fuel brain activity efficiently. As your mind becomes less distracted by the digestive process, you may find it easier to concentrate on tasks.

### Elevated Mood and Reduced Anxiety

Another surprising effect of a water fast is the potential lift in your mood. Studies have shown that fasting can trigger the release of endorphins, the body's natural feel-good chemicals. Additionally, since your body is not busy processing food, you may experience less bloating and discomfort, contributing to an overall sense of well-being. The reduction in anxiety can create an environment where you feel clear-headed and positive.

### Heightened Cognitive Function

Interestingly, a 5-day water fast may stimulate neurogenesis, the ability of your brain to create new neurons. This process is vital for cognitive function and long-term brain health. Fasting promotes a protein called Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which plays a crucial role in learning and memory. As levels of BDNF rise, so does your capacity to think critically and make decisions.

### Enhanced Clarity of Thought

Many participants report a profound increase in clarity of thought during and after a water fast. This is often attributed to the absence of external distractions and the simplicity of solely drinking water. With fewer decisions to make and no food cravings to manage, mental fog can dissipate. You may find that ideas flow more freely, helping you tackle complex problems with ease.

### Detoxification Benefits

Fasting allows your body a chance to reset and detoxify. When you are not consuming food, your body can focus on eliminating toxins that have accumulated over time. This detoxification can lead to sharper mental faculties, as the brain becomes less burdened by internal impurities. Here are a few ways your mind can benefit from detoxification:

- **Reduced Brain Fog:** Clearance of toxins can lead to clearer thinking.
- **Better Memory:** A cleaner bloodstream can improve neural connections.
- **Enhanced Resilience:** Remove physical stressors for improved mental resilience.

### Mindfulness and Self-Awareness

A 5-day water fast also provides a unique opportunity for mindfulness and self-reflection. As you pause your regular eating patterns, you have time to focus on your thoughts, feelings, and motivations. This practice of mindfulness can heighten self-awareness, allowing you to understand more about your habits and triggers. Increased self-awareness is essential for making better decisions in life.

### Greater Creativity

Besides clarity, fasting can also unlock new levels of creativity. Many people report feeling an influx of imaginative ideas during their fasting period. This surge in creativity could stem from the brain's heightened connectivity, which allows for more spontaneous ideas and solutions to emerge. With the absence of standard distractions in your routine, you may unleash creative potential that has been dormant.

### Considerations Before Fasting

Before diving into a 5-day water fast, it's essential to be mindful of certain considerations:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Consult a Healthcare Provider:** Speak with a professional to ensure fasting aligns with your health needs.
- **Listen to Your Body:** If you experience severe discomfort, it may be best to halt the fast.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Adequate water intake is crucial during the fast to avoid dehydration.

A 5-day water fast can offer several benefits that contribute to enhanced mental clarity. From improved focus and elevated moods to heightened cognitive function and creativity, the advantages of this practice may have you considering it as a means to sharpen your mental acuity. Just be sure to approach it with care and attention to your personal well-being.

- **Day 1-2:** Focus on consuming lighter meals such as salads, fruits, and vegetables.
- **Day 3:** Cut out solid foods, transitioning to broths and juices.
- **Day 4:** Only consume clear liquids; herbal teas and coconut water are great options.

### Stay Hydrated

Leading up to your fast, hydration is crucial. Ensure you drink plenty of water in the days before you start. Aim for at least 8-10 glasses daily. Proper hydration helps your body function optimally and prepares it for the water-only intake during the fast.

- **Stock Up on Supplies:** Make sure you have enough clean water and any herbal teas you plan to use during the fast.

### Listen to Your Body

Once you start your 5-day water fast, it’s essential to pay attention to your body’s signals. If you feel dizzy, excessively tired, or experience any concerning symptoms, it’s important to stop the fast and consult with a medical professional. Remember, you are the best judge of your health.

### Post-Fasting Considerations

After completing your water fast, it's vital to break it properly. Start with small portions of easily digestible foods like broth or smoothies. Gradually introduce solid foods to help your body readjust and avoid gastrointestinal distress.

The Science Behind Water Fasting and Its Health Benefits
--------------------------------------------------------

Water fasting is gaining traction as a method used by many to enhance health and boost well-being. By abstaining from food and only consuming water, individuals claim to unlock a range of health benefits. Understanding the science behind water fasting can help you make an informed decision about whether it's right for you.

### What Happens to Your Body During a Water Fast?

When you engage in a five-day water fast, your body undergoes several significant metabolic changes. Here’s a basic overview:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Glycogen Depletion:** Within the first 24 hours, your body uses up its glycogen stores. Glycogen is the stored form of glucose, which serves as your body’s initial source of energy.
- **Keto Adaptation:** After glycogen stores are depleted, your body transitions into a state called ketosis. In ketosis, your body begins to burn stored fat for fuel, which can lead to weight loss.
- **Cellular Repair:** Fasting triggers autophagy, a process where your cells clear out damaged components, potentially reducing aging and improving cellular function.
- **Hormonal Changes:** Insulin levels drop significantly during fasting, enhancing fat burning. Hormones like norepinephrine and growth hormone are also elevated, promoting fat loss and muscle preservation.

### Potential Health Benefits of a Five-Day Water Fast

A five-day water fast can be daunting, but it may offer several health benefits worth considering:

#### 1. Weight Loss

This is perhaps the most recognized benefit. Water fasting can lead to a reduction in calorie intake and increased fat oxidation. Many who have undertaken a five-day fast report noticeable weight loss, primarily from fat rather than muscle.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
#### 2. Improved Insulin Sensitivity

Fasting can enhance your body’s ability to respond to insulin, leading to better blood sugar control. This is particularly beneficial for those at risk of diabetes as it can help lower blood glucose levels.

#### 3. Enhanced Mental Clarity

Many individuals report improved focus and cognitive function during fasting periods. Research suggests that the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which supports brain health, may increase when fasting.

#### 4. Reduced Inflammation

Chronic inflammation could lead to various health issues, including heart disease and certain cancers. Some studies indicate that water fasting can lead to decreased levels of inflammation markers in the body.

### Detoxification Process

Another fascinating aspect of a five-day water fast is the detoxification process. When you stop consuming food, your body uses this time to flush out toxins and unwanted substances. Here are some potential benefits related to detoxification:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
##### 1. Liver Support

Your liver plays a vital role in detoxifying your body. Fasting allows it to catch up on its work by focusing energy on breaking down toxins instead of processing food.

##### 2. Kidney Function

While fasting, the kidneys may also benefit from a break. They can concentrate on filtering out waste without the added workload of digesting food.

### Precautions and Considerations

Before embarking on a five-day water fast, consider the following:

- **Consult a Healthcare Professional:** It's crucial to speak with a doctor or nutritionist beforehand, especially if you have underlying health conditions.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Be attentive to how you feel. If fasting feels overwhelmingly taxing, it’s okay to stop.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Ensure you're consuming enough water throughout the fast to avoid dehydration.

Water fasting can be a powerful tool for improving health. While many people may choose to pursue a five-day plan, it is essential to approach it thoughtfully and with proper guidance. The benefits range from weight loss to detoxification, and with a solid understanding of the science behind it, you can make informed decisions for yourself.

Common Myths and Misconceptions About Water Fasting
---------------------------------------------------

Water fasting involves abstaining from all food and consuming only water for a certain period. While many people turn to this practice for various health benefits, several common myths and misconceptions surround it. Understanding these myths can help clarify what water fasting truly entails and how it can affect your body.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 1: Water Fasting Is Dangerous

One of the most widespread misconceptions is that water fasting is inherently unsafe. While it's true that medical supervision is crucial for those with underlying health conditions, a short-term water fast—typically lasting between 24 to 72 hours—can be safe for healthy individuals. In fact, many people report feeling revitalized and energized after a short fast. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting a fast to ensure it's appropriate for you.

### Myth 2: You Will Lose Muscle Mass

Another common myth is that water fasting leads to significant muscle loss. While it's natural to worry about losing muscle, research shows that short-term fasting tends to preserve muscle mass more effectively than long-term calorie restriction. Your body adapts to fasting by utilizing stored fat for energy instead of muscle tissue. To bolster muscle retention during a fast, incorporating light physical activities, such as walking or yoga, can be beneficial.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 3: You Should Drink Only Water

While water is the star of a water fast, many believe they cannot consume anything else. Interestingly, herbal teas or black coffee without additives are often allowed during fasting periods. These beverages can help suppress appetite and provide additional hydration without breaking the fast. However, you should avoid sugary drinks, fruit juices, or anything containing calories that can hinder the fasting process.

### Myth 4: Water Fasting Is a Quick Fix for Weight Loss

Many people approach water fasting with the hope of shedding pounds quickly. However, weight loss during a water fast primarily comes from water weight and glycogen depletion, not fat loss. Once you resume eating, you may regain that weight quickly. It's important to view water fasting as part of a larger approach to health and wellness rather than a shortcut for weight loss.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Myth 5: Fasting Leads to Nutritional Deficiencies

Some think that fasting inevitably causes nutritional deficiencies. While you won't consume vitamins and minerals during a water fast, the body has a remarkable ability to store nutrients. For brief fasting periods, your body can draw on these reserves. After the fast, replenishing your diet with nutrient-rich foods is crucial to ensure you receive all necessary vitamins and minerals.

### Myth 6: Anyone Can Water Fast Without Issues

While many can safely engage in water fasting, it is not suitable for everyone. People with specific medical conditions, such as diabetes or eating disorders, as well as pregnant or breastfeeding women, should avoid water fasting unless supervised by a healthcare professional. It's vital to listen to your body and consult with a doctor if you have any health concerns.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss – Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Additional Considerations

- **Hydration is Key:** Adequate hydration is critical during water fasting. Aim to drink enough water to stay hydrated, as dehydration can lead to headaches, fatigue, and dizziness.
- **Post-Fasting Care:** How you break your fast can significantly affect how you feel. Gradually reintroduce solid foods, starting with easily digestible options like broths or fruits.
- **Mindset Matters:** Water fasting is as much a mental journey as it is a physical one. Prepare yourself mentally for the experience to stay committed and focused.

Understanding the myths and misconceptions about water fasting can help clarify its benefits and limitations. By approaching fasting with accurate information, you can make informed choices that align with your health goals. Always remember to prioritize your well-being and consult with healthcare professionals when considering changes to your dietary habits.

### Conclusion

Engaging in a 5 day water fast can be a transformative experience for both body and mind. By understanding the various benefits, such as enhanced mental clarity and physical health, you empower yourself to make informed choices. This fasting approach not only encourages weight loss and detoxification, but also allows you to engage in deep introspection, ultimately improving your overall well-being.

Preparing your body before the fast is vital to ensure a smooth experience. Starting with a balanced diet and proper hydration sets the stage for your success. Additionally, dispelling common myths around water fasting helps to clarify any concerns and positions fasting as a safe practice when done correctly.

Choosing the right espresso machine requires balancing your budget with your business needs. Here are some tips to help you make the best decision:

[Breville Bambino],"Hi all, I'm a new coffee enthusiast and I just bought my first espresso machine, the Breville Bambino. After watching countless YouTube videos and reading the manual, I'm still stumped at what's going on.

I'm trying to pull a single shot for my wife, but every time the brewing stops after a few seconds (3-5). I reset the machine, and I've gone finer and coarser with my grind but the machine just stops. It just shoots water for only a few seconds.

The puck is wet when I take it out, and I'm using whole beans that I grind just before making the shot. I tamp it down as instructed but the same thing keeps happening.

1h7d799,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypotheticalsituation/comments/1h7d799/paid_to_do_nothing/,Paid to do nothing?,"The job is sitting in a plain, undecorated college classroom all day to make sure students' belongings are not stolen. You just have to be a body in the room, basically. What is the lowest pay you would accept for this job?

The students come and go, in and out of a lab room where they can't take their stuff and there are no lockers. The classroom you're in, where they leave their stuff, is monitored by video, but that hasn't discouraged masked thieves in the past from raiding backpacks and stealing wallets, computers etc. 

So the University wants to pay you to just hang out in the room all day. Free wifi, but it's a low speed public network. You can bring anything you can reasonably fit in a backpack, even a sleeping mat or bag if you want a nap (though the students going in and out could make that challenging). 

The hours are 8-5. You bring your own food, but some basic snacks (bagged popcorn, chips etc.) and decent coffee (Starbucks) are available in the room for the students and you are encouraged to also partake, but not be greedy. Sometimes there are bagels or a boxed lunch -- at least once a week. There is no kitchen access. 

If you need a bathroom break, you have to call to request it and wait for another staff person to take your place so you can go to the public facility down the hall. You're asked to keep it to under 3 breaks a day of 5 minutes each, but they understand if you have a difficulty. 

The building and classroom meet ADA standards and they will accommodate any physical disability you may have.

If the University calls off classes for weather or any other reason, you are off with pay. You get unpaid time off during scheduled breaks in the academic calendar, such as holidays, but they do still need you to work during summer sessions. You are paid every 2 weeks, and the benefits are pretty good. You can request unpaid vacation or call in sick without pay; any time they have to pay someone else to do the job, you don't get paid.

But, during your shifts, you could sit at a desk with a laptop and play video games or watch movies all day. Or read books, or learn a language. Do Yoga. Whatever you want as long as your body is in the room, as this is enough to deter thieves. 

If you try to steal from the students yourself, you will be caught on camera. So don't do that. But it's not as though anyone is watching you with rapt attention through the camera, and nobody cares what you do within reason. Obviously, exposing yourself or other profane actions will get you fired. But you could watch porn with headphones if you want.

1h7d5ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/rs_x/comments/1h7d5ge/diary_posting_about_jimmy_buffet/,Diary Posting about Jimmy Buffet,"This morning I went to the kitchen to make coffee and saw my mom had taken out her old guitar again, she’s been doing this more lately. She’s 67 and looking for creative outlets. She was playing “Come Monday” by Jimmy Buffet and before I knew it I was hurrying away with my coffee because I was about to burst into tears.

My dad, the love of her life, died in the late 90s from an OD. Everybody thinks it was a heart attack because he was of high esteem in the community but it was an OD. I was only five and didn’t find that out until my high school therapist told me, she was my mom’s therapist before, during, and after my dad’s death as well. That’s another story. 

My dad was a veterinarian, visionary, avid fisherman and Jimmy Buffet enthusiast, a real parrot head. Life of the party, beloved by all. He was also a Hunter S Thompson wannabe and recreational drug user. I remember at his funeral, which was attended by hundreds of people, looking at him in the open casket, he was wearing a Hawaiian shirt and a hat that had a fish coming out of the front of it and I remember thinking he looked blue. I remember hearing his brother’s voice coming from another room and thinking it was him and a sudden realization in my child mind that I didn’t really get what was happening. It was like a third person moment. I dunno. 

I don’t think I ever really had the opportunity to grieve the loss of my Dad and I feel like I have new things to grieve about him thrown at me over the years, like finding out it was an OD. I’d later find out I was donor conceived and that he wasn’t my biological dad. I’d later be contacted by his brother’s wife, my mom cut off all contact with his side of the family and his friends after his death, and she told me that he is still an active part of their household as a ghost. That’s why she reached out. What am I supposed to say to that? I just felt sad. I have never been able to talk about any of this stuff with my mom, the only other person in my life who knew him and knew the truth, because she immediately becomes so heart broken that she just loses it. It’s been like that since he died when I was five. Any mention of him is taboo in my family simply because my mom’s heart was so broken and she lashes out at my siblings and I if anything is brought up. It sucks. 

My mom and dad had a romantic life together before the kids came along. They never wanted to have kids and my mom always tells me I shouldn’t have kids. I guess she changed her mind in her 30s enough to go the IVF route but she regrets that. They were big into windsurfing and they windsurfed their way across the world. She tells me funny stories about backpacking through Europe with him and fond memories about how they met in vet school in NYC. Any story I tell about him makes her burst into tears and inevitably she will start verbally attacking me, it’s def some sort of projection. My siblings don’t remember him, they were only two when he passed, and they’re so angry about the whole donor conceived secret that it’s equally as impossible to talk to them about any of this. Nobody in my family knows my perspective on any of this. 

Then there’s Jimmy Buffet. I have a lot of very early memories with my Dad, I think the trauma of his death set those early memories in stone in my mind, and a lot of them involve Jimmy Buffet. Mostly just different times we were driving and he’d put on Cheeseburger in Paradise and we’d sing along to it together. Singing Cheeseburger in Paradise down the dirt road to our camp, singing Cheeseburger in Paradise on the way to the ski slopes, singing Cheeseburger in Paradise while we took an extra lap around the neighborhood just because. Whenever I hear a Jimmy Buffet song come on I feel like I have about two and a half minutes to fit in some grief. 

Hearing my mom playing and singing Come Monday might be too much though. Hearing her sing “and I just want you back by my siiide” kills me. I feel so sorry for her and for what she lost. She sleeps a lot and says that he still visits her in her dreams and they go on adventures together like they used to. I wish he’d visit me like he allegedly visits his brother and my mom but maybe he never even wanted me to begin with. I was once struck by a vision, it was from her point of view back in my childhood home, she was shutting the door to my childhood room and saying goodnight, turning and holding in tears and running out onto the deck and breaking down and looking at the starry sky in the middle of the lonely woods. I think this vision was a real thing she did but I would never ask, but the feeling that came with that vision was just such gut wrenching heart break and fear, I feel for her so much. 

The last time I talked to my Mom about Dad and Jimmy Buffet was last year when Jimmy Buffet died. It was a big moment for us because amazingly, he died on my Dad’s birthday. I told her I hoped they were eating cheeseburgers in paradise together and she cried and told me how much that meant to her. It meant a lot to me too and I really do hope they are putting back margaritas and eating cheeseburgers in paradise together.

Just to preface I was ADDICTED to vaping I hadn’t gone a day without it for 5 years straight and I tried quitting cold turkey a handful of times and it never worked. 

1. ZYNS- I had gotten zyns at first to substitute the vape, but only 3mg. I never got a buzz I just used it to get rid of any intense craving. I honestly went through a whole tin in 2 days at first. I also only got the worst flavor (coffee) to regret putting one in, and it made me taper off it. This process took me about a month to where I only put one in the whole day. I also hated the way it made my throat burn and I had to drink so much water when I had one in to help the burning so that helped me taper off them too. 

2. GUM- I also tried gum for a week, but I HATED how it burned my throat so that was short lived. 

3. PATCHES- didn’t give me the most relief of what zyns did but it was ok. 

Overall-  if you can’t quit cold turkey try other options other than vapes, but it’s honestly all about mindset. I wanted to quit so bad bc I already had asthma and I loved to run but vaping made me short of breath. I also am graduating college in a week with a nursing degree (ik lol). But do I still crave a hit of a new vape? Of course. But it’s not bad anymore. I promise you can do it bc I never thought I could have 😊 ",7,1733415376.0,QuitVaping,1,1.0,False

1h7cs9e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h7cs9e,Day 5 ,"Thursday is a lazy do nothing day.   I decided to check with a pee strip for comparison when I woke up to pee.  The strips are very old so I don't know how good they are.  


Back in 2012 I was tracking EVERYTHING for 3 or 4 months.  One of the things I discovered about myself was I lost weight in the sleeping time after 7 ish hours.  I would get up and make my husband breakfast and weigh myself.  Go back to sleep and next time I woke up to stay up I weighed myself again and lost weight if I did everything correctly the day before.  


These 2 readings kind of show that.  Even while in deep ketosis your body is busy doing various things and doesn't dig into the fat until near the end of your sleep time.  Someone else on Reddit wrote the name of this but I don't remember what it's called.  Your body burns some fat at the end of sleep time to help get you moving for the day.  So if you are super tired in the morning and NEED coffee to function you probably aren't getting enough sleep to hit that fat burn for start-up energy point.  That means go to bed earlier.  


I'm not sure if fat burning ketosis levels are unlimited and safe for intentional fasting / dieting.  Most things are geared towards T1D and the danger of things going wrong with their bodies.  Each time I long-term fast I up my safety limit by 1 so this time my limit is 9.  But if I was only using a pee test or nothing I have no idea how high my levels would be.   So I'm currently undecided.  Put the breaks on if over 9 (small meals), up my limit to 10 (as long as I feel fine), or totally ignore safety concerns and see how high I can get it. 


We went for a Pokemon walk and used the daily incense and fought a monster.   You can see the dip in HR (blue) where we were fighting a Pokemon.  


Also today I dug this dish tower out of storage.  I bought it at Target when we lived in the USA.  We are getting close enough to New Years Day that osechi (the food for that day) ads are arriving in the mail and being shown on TV.   Last year MIL ordered osechi that costs about $200.  🤦🏼‍♀️  So today I dug this out and talked about making it and not buying it to head her off from ordering something expensive.  She's all ""I want sushi from Hamasushi"".  But hubby has said ""you can make ribs that day"".   


MIL says it's too much work to make.  I said it's 70% things to buy and only a little cooking.  More like a snack tray.  Green and black olives, egg roll 卵焼き, honey walnuts, sweet black beans, sliced chicken breast, ham...  things that can sit out all day and taste good cold / room temperature.  This is usually a munch all day thing for other families I know but MIL treats it more like dinner.  Maybe I can throw some cheese and crackers in there.  Grapes, and another type of nut like cashew or macadamia?  And cook ribs with carrot and potato for dinner.  Hey, maybe hubby can cook us pancakes for breakfast. 


After our Pokemon walk ...  Hubby ""how long fasting?  Let's eat pizza tomorrow night.""  Pointing towards the pizza pasta restaurant.  Me ""It's only been 1 week, my goal is 3.  No"" 

Later ... Me ""If you want pizza you can go.  I don't think we have a coupon.""  Hubby ""maybe we will go get sushi this weekend instead.""  Me ""OK, then pick up the osechi flyer if you also want sushi on New Years Day.""  


Notes :  Electric pressure cooker, ribs in the freezer that we recently bought, ate half froze half.  The sushi place is local and we eat there frequently.   I really want the mushroom pizza at Jolly Pasta more than the pizza at Happy Valley.",5,1733415244.0,fasting,3,0.86,False
