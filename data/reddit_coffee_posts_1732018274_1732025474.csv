[Remember that in early November of 2020 GME's Price Action looked like this with smaller and larger periods of consolidation before things went totally critical after Q3 earnings of that year.](https://preview.redd.it/71bv5aad8v1e1.png?width=3520&format=png&auto=webp&s=3edc5b4c8a7fad40bf4d174cd2ee659130e84cbf)

Consolidation? Really? But we were a stone's throw from $30 last week! I know, I know, just up and green every day would be nice. However, we still have to remember that, like it or not, until we have some truly disruptive, bullish news on the stock, Market Makers are in control of our price action to a major degree. If they stand to lose big, they will intervene in our price action to prevent such occurrences from happening. Remember, **\*they believe the options market exists to serve them.\***

So then, WTF, we dump?

Not exactly. Our options market currently looks to be shaping up in such a way that GME can sit at elevated price levels AND MMs can close some upcoming weeks very close to their optimal profit points. I'll explain. Let's go! 

**Price Movement Recap**

[GME 11\/19 Trading Day 1min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/v9g6il8pgu1e1.png?width=1222&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a12eb8cd8c4fd5928de329b739f48333eb0a200)

The name of the game yesterday was IV crush. The stock indeed had essentially no reaction to the news of Nat Turner joining the board. Trading start out in a tight window, perhaps probing to see if some major reaction would express itself in our price action. After negotiating a narrow VWAP range centered on the 200min SMA, the stock probed downward to test price sentiment with respect to our notable, but comparatively mild $26 gamma position and whether a downward test would trigger a bear dogpile down to $25 proper. Instead, the price hit $25.85 as a daily low and, unable to trigger serious continued bearishness, reversed to the upside where we got an early test of our sizable gamma position at $27. Thus did we map out and establish rough correspondence to the 'path of least resistance' scenario I laid out yesterday, namely trading within the $25-$27 bracket with $26 as a midrange inflection point (I specifically used the term 'speedbump' yesterday). 

With us totaling only our yearly average volume of shares traded on the day (8.5mil) and only half of our average volume versus last week, the remainder of the day saw a listing trend down to $26.44 at the close and an IV loss of over 20 percentage points. This move absolutely bled OTM options - Calls and Puts alike - to what I can only assume was the absolute delight of all dealers and IV sellers. $30 Calls for 1/22 lost 70% of their value on the day while calls farther out like the 1/17 $125s lost around 60% of their value versus open last Friday (you can see more clearly how drastic this looked down in our **IV Trends** section with the 10-Day Mean IV chart).

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

For this week's OI we have some notable changes. New Put OI is discernibly flowing in at a higher rate (though not a critically higher rate) compared to last week. Even though much of this volume is from short Put sales aiming to take advantage of IV loss, it will still have the effect of 'negatizing' our gamma hedge environment, as we'll see below, though not the extent that it will compromise the stability of our trading structure. 

[11\/22 OI Changes 11\/18-11\/18](https://preview.redd.it/i5bf07holu1e1.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=db0b69f4f5ef6652cbbbccc8844af99051b033a2)

As we can see above, our most notable changes in OI were centered around $25 for new Put Oi and at $27, $28, and $30 which, like Puts, was biased toward short volume, though only slightly. I will be keeping an eye on $25 going forward, to see how traders continue to open positions around this mark and whether we might aim to slip back under the $25 mark. The chance of this occurring for now is not critical, but that can change in a couple days depending on options market activity.

As we look into the following week, we can see some similarly concentrated shifts:  


[11\/29 OI Changes 11\/\/18-11\/19](https://preview.redd.it/yjjj4purlu1e1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9d64b0d4833a26e68b49e349f4a97cf0bda77d3)

$25 Puts for 11/29 were another popular contract to sell short yesterday, even more than for 11/22. This indicates that several traders at least echo my thoughts yesterday that $25 likely represents a near-term floor on any downside price action.

These modifications of our OI have had some interesting effects on our Max Pain strikes for the next few weeks, elevating the 11/22 Max Pain to $24 and 11/29 to $22.

https://preview.redd.it/qxh556dexu1e1.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca38620ee34de0eb729162bac60b373464d37f07

**Gamma Exposure**

Daily GEX has responded in some predictable ways to these OI Changes. Our Put/Call GEX ratio is trending up, but only slightly in response to the new Put OI on the board:

https://preview.redd.it/y6dr0vxjxu1e1.png?width=413&format=png&auto=webp&s=090c6e9fddd30e0d95f8769be3ad013eaacee43b

Intraday, however, with OI Changes overall somewhat light throughout our primary trading range, we are not looking at much consequential modification of our intraday hedging landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/dagz09rlyu1e1.png?width=481&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcddf1ad588492eeb46fd899d09733948c847e4e

Again, our path of least resistance for the near-term with no news or external reasons for why Call-Buying volume should pick up, we are most likely looking at stable trading inside the $25-$27 range. These two strikes - $25 and $27 - serve as hedging 'bookends' that sizably suppress volatility as they are approach through the natural course of options-induced Market Maker hedging. The light net Call Gamma accumulations at $26.50, $26, and $25.50 make it much easier for traders and institutions to move the price around this range. By 'easier' I mean that it is less expensive to move the price up or down this range via capital commitments in the options market. It is significantly less expensive to stimulate a $1 move from $25.50-$26.50, for example, than it is to stimulate a move from $27-$28. 

With that being said, if for some reason there should be significant news that projects bullishly for the stock (outside of whatever else is already anticipated) and buy volume should pick back up, the $27-$28 is in shape to resume is 'sticky' properties for our price as a platform in spitting distance of $30. With what we know right now, however, such as scenario does not seem likely for this week. 

**Technicals**

[7\/12-11\/18 1-Day Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/8bkwvai41v1e1.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=a435be235f43e7f2ac80f6c2eb4b80ed07d0d9cc)

While our 1-Day aggregation chart does look like it could project a deeper retracement over the next few weeks into the $23 area, our 4-hour and 1-hour periods suggest that the stock price will test support slightly North of $25 this week as it aligns with their 50SMA and 200SMA levels respectively:

[10\/2-11\/19 4-hour Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/q8s8kizn3v1e1.png?width=1491&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bce3078335cfd78c17df146a746f132cc4e2f1f)

[10\/25-11\/19 1-Hour Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/wy8q1xgu2v1e1.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=fba90a141e61748f1050440704ba769453ae79f8)

While we never know \*for sure\* how the market will respond to technical supports, the confluence of the 50-4hr, 200-hour, 1-hour RSI, 4-hour RSI, $25 Gamma Position, and $25 as a 'round number' and historic ceiling on the price through our Aug-Sept period does suggest that when the $25 area is approached there is a high likelihood that it will serve as a signal for decently sized upside reversal, though how far that reversal would go at this point I cannot say - at least to the $27 area in the short term. 

A deeper bearish argument \*could\* be made for the 1-Day aggregation as a significant determinant on our price action is strengthened only by our behavior from late July to late October when we used the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages as a trading channel. However, since our National Cat Day exit of this channel, traders have ceased to consider its indicators as meaningful. This contrasts with our behavior on the 1-hour and 4-hour charts, where price action has respected technical patterns on these charts with close scrutiny for several weeks now, as I have often pointed out. We also currently have so little Open Interest and MM Gamma Exposure across the $22-$25 range at this point, that it is at least evident that the Options Market is not betting currently on a reversal that cuts \*that\* deeply to the downside. 

**IV Trends**

[10-Day Mean Implied Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/gvtvnmdnju1e1.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4c2db0424c86ca226f4e29c8e5bfe592c217896)

[Schwab IV](https://preview.redd.it/pxskefxxju1e1.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e4a9ddd08c32494266b14eaf03a111473e4345)

However, Market Makers can still rake in the cash from their Options Dealership role \*without\* major price collapse. Indeed, as I mentioned and as you can see especially in the Mean IV chart, simply trading sideways on reduced volume even in the $26-$27 range causes tremendous extrinsic value loss up and down both sides of the options chain. Indeed, the fact that our Options Max Pain points are creeping up quite close to that floor of $25 indicates that options activity is structuring our open interest landscape in such a way as to make the Market Maker optimum profitability point much closer to that historic, GEX, and technical support point at $25. IV can still bleed heavily on sideways trading in our $25-$27 - especially if Dealers can lock in that trading for two full weeks - in such a way as to enable an ideal 're-up and reload' period in expectation of the anticipated 2-Week Q3 IV appreciation ramp-up pattern we've seen return to GME these past two years.

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

We still look to maintain stable trading within the $25-$27 range I spoke about yesterday. We have many technical, historic, and options indicators converging on $25 as a strong point of support for the stock price, while OI data continues to show Max Pain values that indicate Market Maker optimal profitability is likely and increasingly not at odds with the respect of a $25 support point. It is likely that, barring any major news, the options market will witness a continued IV bleed, with heavy depreciative consequences for the extrinsic value of OTM contracts on both sides of the options chain - at least until we come face to face with the two-week Q3 Earnings report IV ramp up to begin sometime around the very end of November.

Cheers and good luck out there, everyone!

I've had a lot of generous coffee donors over the past few days and weeks to whom I have had the pleasure of giving shoutouts - I'll be sure to revisit everyone who was generous enough to donate as I drink your coffees! Thank you friends :)

For those of you who are on X, I have, at the encouragement of several users, decided to start crossposting there. These posts will be identical to those found here on Superstonk, so no need to leave the party here. However, just in case there are any 'issues' with my posts in the future, you'll be able to find each and every Open Interest Newsletter in the Articles tab of my profile. Open Interest will remain aimed toward the Superstonk - and GME shareholder - community first and foremost. So, rest assured, this will in no way affect my attention here.

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I rarely hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

When she follows the clues in her purse she ends up in the hotel she spent the night before.
Then a lady who works there approached her while speaking German, to which Kory replied back in German as well. That means she already kissed someone who speaks German.

Then the lady asks if she could send something to Kory’s room, to which Kory turns around and asks back what did she have in mind. The lady then goes “The same as before?” and Kory gets confused, not knowing what she meant by “the same”.
The lady eyes Kory up and down and says “oh madam, you make me blush.” with a knowing expression as if there was some underlying meaning. They both chuckle, Kory  awkwardly because she didn’t know what was going on and after a while she says “maybe just some coffee.” And walks away smiling.

It might not be that deep but this interaction just got me really confused. Besides some people believe Starfire to be pansexual, which kinda makes sense.

1guxv1g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1guxv1g,Current Collection After Trial and Error,"I wanted to share my current collection after being in the game for almost 2 years! After countless blind buys, samples, and trades, I’ve reached a point where I can confidently say everything I own is a 10/10 for me. In the slides after, you can see all the colognes I used to own but have since let go. To give back to the community, I’m going to review each one quickly and why I kept/let it go: 

Fragrances I own: 

CC Blonde Amber - Super nice amber vanilla with some dried fruit and spiciness too. Use this as my special occasion fragrance.

LV Imagination - Fresh and clean scent with a hint of sophistication as well. Use this as my school/work fragrance, but is super versatile and can be used whenever.  

Sospiro Vibrato - Another fresh scent with a blast of ginger and some florals in the back. Really easy to dress up or down. Use this as my summer/club going out scent. 

Mind Games Queening - The newest pick up, a beautiful coconut vanilla rum scent that is so cozy and smells amazing. Use this as my cold weather day scent. 

MFK Oud Satin Mood - Definitely one of my more interesting scents, a rosey oud vanilla fragrance that smells so unique. Use this as my cold weather going out scent. 

LV Afternoon Swim - A super realistic citrus fragrance that smells almost like fruit candy. Use this as my warm weather day scent. 

On the way - Bond no. 9 Lafayette Street. Smelled this in store and fell in love. In seach of a bottle. 

Fragrances I no longer own and why: 

YSL Y EDP - A great beginner fragrance that smells great, just became a bit cloying almost to me and reminded me of a teenager. If thats you, by all means get it. 

YSL La Nuit De L’Homme EDP - Was my second fragrance I ever got. It’s nice, but you can definitely find better for the price. La Nuit De L’Homme is much better. 

Bleu de Chanel EDT - My first fragrance. Will always be a favorite of mine, but eventually you have to move on. Also, I like the EDP a bit more! The macy’s worker really pressured me into this one looking back. 

PDM Carlisle - Got this in a trade. Definitely a dark scent but was definitely too powerful and mature for me. Kind of smelled like oil and tires in a way, not really sure.

Killian Angels’ Share - This is a nice fragrance, but honestly felt a little feminine to me because of the praline note (also my sister owns kismet angel so it reminded me of her).

BDK Gris Charnel Extrait - This is another dark fragrance that felt a bit too mature for me. I just couldnt think of a time I would use it, and it smelled a bit lactonic to me in the opening. 

MFK Grand Soir - This gets a lot of hype so I might get some hate for this, but I feel as though it may be too mature for younger audiences. Definitely a refined and sophisticated vanilla scent. Also, not a big fan of the balsamic-ish opening. The dry down is heavenly though. 

PDM Oajan- A much bigger fan of this than angels’ share. An addictive cinnamon apple pie scent that I couldnt stop putting on. It felt a bit powdery to me and for the price point I feel like there are other sweet fragrances that could be a better option, but one of my favorites! 

Initio Side Effect - Another hyped up fragrance. It was nice but gave me a headache for some reason again, maybe it was the boozy cinamon tobacco combination. 

The blazing mr. sam - Smelled great in store, ordered it online. Comes in - eh. It’s nice, but another mature scent thats harder to pull off. Also doesn’t last that long. Favorite bottle design! 

Dior Homme Intense - I still love this fragrance. Smelled it completely randomly in a duty free store in switzerland. Cannot recommend enough for a nice date night/ special occasion fragrance! A pretty saturated category which is why I don’t own it, but great.

Aventus Cologne- Smells great. Performance and longevity? Horrible. Had to let it go because of it, but maybe an older batch might be better.

PDM Percival - A nice everyday scent, but for the price you pay I just have to say it’s not worth it. To a random person it just smells like deodorant or body spray. 

Xerjoff Torino 21 - Another favorite of mine! Minty mojito vibes and a great summer fragrance. Let it go because I enjoyed afternoon swim a bit more. 

Oud satin mood extrait - Yes I had the extrait before the EDP due to the hype. Honestly, any time I wore this the powdery effect was way too strong and people told me I smelled like an old lady. I like the EDP more! 

Xerjoff Uden - I still like this, a nice coffee vanilla fragrance and something people should look for! Let it go because vibrato is more suited to my taste. 

Creed Aventus - The all-time great but same problem with aventus cologne; performance and longevity are horrible. Wish that this was fixed in the future!

Prada L’homme - Another favorite of mine, super clean soapy iris. If imagination didnt exist, I would still own this. 

Intio musk therapy—It was just fine. The musk was definitely prominent, but it made me smell… wet? I’m unsure how to describe it.

PDM Layton—Another nice scent, but a bit overrated, in my opinion. Althair and Oajan are better, but it's still a classic scent that everyone should get their nose on. 

Initio Paragon - This reminded me of cough syrup and gave me an intense headache—hard pass. 

That’s all! I’ve smelled a lot more than these so hmu if you have any questions. If you made it to the end I appreciate you.",2,1732025041.0,Colognes,0,1.0,False

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

It's an ingenious thriller about a hack writer who goes to a remote, sleepy town to cure his writer's block, but ends up on the run from the law and darker cosmic forces when his wife goes missing. 

Here's the craziest part - MY WIFE LEFT ME. I'm not entirely sure how long she's been gone or when she left, (I've been too busy thinking about writing) but next thing I know, the police are asking me questions. 

Questions like ""Where's your wife? ""Did you murder your wife?"" ""What is this creepy book on the coffee table?""  

Naturally, when I explain my best-selling premise to them, they all want to read it. I've tried burning it, burying it, I even ripped it into tiny pieces and ate them one by one but it just keeps coming back!

She had to run inside for a sec the other day and had me hold her smoke; so I weird to hold one again especially lit but I maintained and did not put my lips to it.

I’m so glad I quit but I do miss it and think about it all the time.

My routine always was getting a nice hot espresso in the morning and then standing out in the middle of a big empty parking lot and have a smoke and play Pokemon go with my espresso. I get iced espressos now and have even stopped going for coffee everyday; I been making it at home.

1guxquh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1guxquh,App Update: Multibrew on iOS ,"Howdy everyone!

A while back, I made a web app called Multibrew and shared it with the community. Something that became clear within a few weeks of that post is that it’s very inconvenient to open up a web browser in order to brew coffee: thus, I made a mobile version!

iOS link [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/multibrew/id6499178775)

The app is essentially a glorified calculator with the goal of getting you into your brew session as quickly as possible. While it includes brew info on some other brewing methods, the app is most tailored for pour over since that’s my favorite brewing method :)

On the topic of coffee apps, I do want to acknowledge the this app isn’t better than the others available (Filtru, FourSix which is the GOAT, Beanconqueror, etc). I just wanted to try making my own tool because why not? If you’ve read up to this point, many thanks and happy brewing!

Centralized large coffee vs smaller individual foggers. Which one is recommended?,"I work in apparel industry and we do screen printing as part of our offerings.

To prevent inks from drying way too fast on screens on the presses, a fogger system has been deemed necessary, using fog to moisturize ink on screen continuously.

We have 20 presses, of which at any given moment, at least 16 are operational.

So for the fogger system.

Would it make more sense to have a huge industrial fogger in a central area with piping and water traps delivering fog to screens or smaller individual foggers delivering fog to one or two presses?

Our presses have 14, 16, 18, and 32 pallets/heads.

Screen->flasher->cool down is how we operate.


For the central system, I think it'll be more reliable and can deliver huge amounts of fog, but I have no previous experience delivering fog as long as 60 feet from its source.

I'll need at least 500ml of yeild. I don't want to go through the process of pulling 12-15 shots and instead use an aeropress to simplify and speed up the process. 

My current plan is to use Hoffman's aeropresso recipe and scale up the recipe to increase the yield. I'm thinking 50g of finely ground medium dark - dark roasted coffee and 200ml of water (should just about max out the aeropresso capacity). 

Does anyone have experience trying to do a recipe like this? Is it not as simple and just scaling up the ingredients to get a similar style of output? Anything I should know for making a larger batch of espresso style coffee? 

Current planned recipe:
1. Place a paper filter in the cap and rinse with hot water. 
2. Add ~~18 g~~ 50g of ground coffee to the brew chamber. It should be ground fairly fine (a bit coarser than an espresso grind). 
3. Pour ~~90 g~~ 200g of hot water over the grounds. 
4. Stir to remove any clumps, a little bit aggressively. 
5. Fasten the filter cap and let sit 1'30"". 6. Flip the AeroPress and press gently into a cup. Keep pressing all the way through the hissing.

He can hear very clearly when I shift dishes in the dish pan or even if I am unscrewing the lid off a jar, but he cannot hear conversation.

by c.w. cobblestone

&#x200B;

It was a long, cold, lonely walk to the Greyhound station, and the bumpy bus ride home sucked even worse, with two syllables taunting me the entire trip:

*Moo-Moo. Moo-Moo. MOO-MOO! Moooo-Mooooo. Mooooooooooooooo-Moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!*

As the scenery zoomed by outside my window, I struggled to breathe through the COVID mask, feeling like the whole universe was dipped in shit. I was on the fast track to Bizarro Land, and felt powerless to stop the runaway train. Worse, I wasn’t sure I even wanted to stop it, since deviating from the humiliating future my master had mapped out for me meant not having Elena in my life.

My life.

I wasn’t even sure what that meant anymore. The idea of getting castrated had been radical enough, and I still was trying to process that twisted reality when, out of the blue, my future became even bleaker, thanks to my mother-in-law’s ridiculous suggestion that I not only get my balls cut off, but undergo gender reassignment surgery as well.

However, as the miles flew by and I thought about it more deeply, I eventually had to admit her idea wasn’t so ridiculous, after all. In fact, the plan was downright ingenious, and it worked for everyone.

Everyone, that is, except me.

*Moo-Moo. Moo-Moo. MOO-MOO! Moooo-Mooooo. Mooooooooooooooo-Moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!*

As Linda had pointed out, forcing me to become trans would give Elena the moral high road, since she could act like she was magnanimously accepting my conversion while allowing me to continue living with her and her “new boyfriend.” In this paradigm, Linda wouldn’t have to tell her friends that her daughter was a cheating, gold-digging slut; Elena would be seen as a compassionate, understanding wife who was helping hubby navigate an identity crisis.

My wife was so ridiculously in love with Kurt, she didn’t care what people thought, which is why she’d decided to start openly dating him after dragging him home that fateful first night, when he kicked my ass and showed me who was boss. But Linda had always been a worrywart when it came to what was being said in gossip circles, so Elena was happy to go along with whatever her mom wanted, as long as it was okay with Kurt.

In a diatribe that’ll haunt me to the grave, my beloved wife had also told me she was looking forward to my sex change because it would help her forget she’d ever made the mistake of marrying a fat loser like me. Elena, the woman of my dreams, wanted me to disappear.

As far as my bully of a master was concerned, he was delighted at the prospect of turning me into a transgendered sissy. It would cement his power over me and erase my manhood far more effectively than a simple castration would have achieved, while allowing him to openly pursue his relationship with my wife without looking like some slug who’d broken up a marriage. As a bonus, he’d be making Elena’s mom happy. The idea seemed perfect to Kurt.

*Moo-Moo. Moo-Moo. MOO-MOO! Moooo-Mooooo. Mooooooooooooooo-Moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!*

The twins? They thought the whole thing was hilarious. So did Tom.

I was the only loser in this shitty deal. But there was nothing I could do about it, so, as my master had decreed, I vowed to start thinking of myself in a whole new light. I knew that for all intents and purposes, Roger Chalmers would soon be gone — erased like a piece of trash that’s buried in a landfill, never to be seen again. That’s what my mother had wanted. Elena, too.

A whole new person would arise from the ashes: A chubby, transgendered stockbroker named Elsie “Moo-Moo” Chalmers. I thought about the two other trans women at the firm; nobody seemed fazed by them, and their sexual identities didn’t appear to affect their jobs, so I figured it wouldn’t be too difficult from a logistics standpoint to make the transition at work.

Still, I knew it was going to be mortifying to show up at the office in drag, and have to tell everyone I’d always felt like a woman inside. The more I envisioned it, the sadder I became.

I tried to chase away my depression by blocking out thoughts about the scary future — but the past was just as shitty. The previous few days had been completely demoralizing; I’d hardly said two words to my beloved wife the whole time I was at the cabin, and I certainly didn’t get to spend any time alone with her. On the few occasions when she did speak to me, she spat insults that cut me to ribbons in front of her lover and family.

Aside from my mental distress, I was physically exhausted from having dug a 15-foot hole in a ridiculously short period of time, and from tossing and turning each night while trying to sleep on hard, lumpy logs. On top of that, whenever I’d been summoned to the cabin after hours of waiting in the woodshed like a sad, pathetic loser, I’d been subjected to nonstop verbal abuse. Finally, after I’d finished cleaning up the Thanksgiving dinner mess, my masters sent me on my way, making me walk 25 fucking miles to the fucking bus stop, rather than allowing me to use MY OWN FUCKING MONEY to get an Uber.

I shuddered with the realization that Kurt had turned Elena and her family into bullies like him. He seemed to be persuasive that way, and I imagined when he was in school, he’d probably been the ringleader who’d recruited others to help him terrorize the class nerds.

I hadn’t had time to ask for permission to eat, and while I was dying to use the debit card to grab a bite when the bus stopped at stations along the route, I knew better. By the time we rolled into Kansas, I was damn near starving, and was ready to start begging people for money.

During a stop in the Topeka station, which had a McDonald’s, I saw a man leave a tray with a half-eaten Quarter Pounder and almost an entire order of fries atop a trash bin, since the basket was overflowing and there was nowhere else to put the food. I glanced around to ensure nobody was looking before scooping up the tray. Too hungry to be ashamed, I plopped down in a booth and devoured the hand-me-down burger and fries, leaning back and enjoying a long, satisfied burp afterward.

I remained hungry for the rest of the journey, but it wasn’t as terrible as it would’ve been had I not pilfered some stranger’s combo meal, plus a couple jelly packets someone had left on a nearby table.

As soon as I got home, I wolfed down two ham sandwiches and a bowl of pork and beans, and then went online to research gender reassignment surgery options. I decided to go with a nearby clinic that had top-notch ratings, where I’d have to wait about three months after completing counseling sessions and classes. That seemed to be the waiting time for all the facilities, and I wasn’t sure how that was going to sit with Kurt, since he’d ordered me to give him my balls as a Christmas present, and there wasn’t enough time to get the surgery done before the holiday.

During my lunch hour Monday, I ducked outside and phoned the clinic to make an appointment for the initial consultation. I couldn’t believe the words that spilled from my mouth as I lied and told the receptionist that I’d always felt like I was trapped in a woman’s body. The lady was patient and kind, and helped me get through the ordeal to set up an appointment for 2 p.m. that Friday. She was obviously practiced in dealing with people in distress, although she had no idea why I was so wigged out. Unlike most of those who called her, I was being forced to have this operation. The receptionist did make a tough phone call easier, though, and I felt confident I’d chosen the right clinic.

When I got home from work, Elena’s truck was in the driveway next to Kurt’s. With a defeated sigh, I parked in the street and trudged up the front steps.

The second I walked through the door, Kurt barked: “Hey, fat boy, how’s about fetching me another beeeeuuurrrr?” He burped the last word.

“Yes, Sir, right away, Sir,” I said as I shut the door behind me and scuttled toward the kitchen. There were three empty beer cans on the coffee table, while another two lay on the carpet, although my master’s slurred speech alone would’ve been a dead giveaway that he’d been drinking heavily. From the looks of the half-empty Chardonay bottle on the table, I surmised Elena was also feeling no pain.

Kurt snorted as I set his fresh beer in front of him and began collecting the empties. “You’re gonna be one ugly bitch, you know that?”

I adjusted my mask and whispered, “yes, Sir.”

“Did you make the appointment?”

“Yes, Sir, the first consultation is Friday at 2.”

Kurt glared at me. “Consultation? Fuck all that — when’s the appointment to get turned into a woman? To get your nuts cut off?”

“Um, Sir, it takes at least three months, Sir; they make you go to counseling, and take a class.”

My master scoffed. “You mean you need to take a class on how to be a fag?”

“Well, that’s one he’ll pass with straight A’s!” Elena giggled.

My wife and her lover enjoyed a good laugh, before she looked at me with her familiar expression of disgust. “Why the hell are you still wearing men’s clothes, anyway … Moo-Moo?”

Elena had come up with the humiliating name that amused her boyfriend so much, and she seemed to relish using it like a sword.

I blinked and fiddled with the empty beer cans I was holding. “Um … I … Ma’am, I didn’t know I was supposed to … um, make the change right away.”

“Yes, do it right away, idiot.” Elena’s eyes flashed. “Didn’t I tell you I wanted the old you gone? Because I’m sick of looking at you? I want there to be a new you — Moo-Moo!”

That cracked Kurt up, but Elena kept at me.

“Did you think I was joking, moron?”

“I … n-no, Ma’am, I … I’m sorry … I just didn’t know I had to do it now; I thought you wanted me to wait … you know, for the operation.”

“Well, there you go thinking again, when you don’t have the equipment — upstairs or downstairs,” my drunken wife slurred for probably the 10,000th time.

And for the 10,000th time, I hung my head in shame and stood there like a fat slug.

Elena snapped her fingers. “Hello? Earth to Fuck-face?” She pointed to her wine glass. “Refill that, and then go the store and buy yourself a new wardrobe. You’ll probably have to go to Lane Bryant to find anything that fits you; there’s one on 56th Street. Get business dresses for the office, and some housedresses you can wear when you’re cleaning up around here.”

Kurt snickered. “Let’s make him dress like a maid.”

“Perfect, since that’s pretty much all he is anyway,” my wife concurred before sneering up at me. “Moo-Moo the maid. Sound good to you, Moo-Moo?”

“Um, yes, Ma’am.”

“You can order some maid’s dresses online later,” Elena instructed. “Get the kind the maids wear in the hotels; I’m sure they make them for fat women, because I’ve seen some of those heifers.”

“Um, yes, Ma’am.”

“Good. More wine. And then get going. Moo-Moo.""

After setting the empties on the table, I refilled my wife’s glass before tossing the beer cans in the kitchen recycling bin. Then, I plodded back outside like a braindead zombie.

I was too overwhelmed with fear and self-pity to formulate cogent thoughts, other than those damn two syllables:

*Moo-Moo. Moo-Moo. MOO-MOO! Moooo-Mooooo. Mooooooooooooooo-Moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!*

1guxp99,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1guxp99/intense_dream_of_meeting_my_first_love_what/,Intense dream of meeting my first love. What ,"Last night I had a pretty intense and emotional dream when I met my first love from high school. We haven't spoken for 10 years. I moved to a different country. We broke up because we just grew apart over time after high school. 
I broke up recently with my partner (1.5 month ago) and it has been very traumatic - I was betrayed pretty badly. I am still recovering.

In the dream me and my first love we were attending some kind of high school gathering. He noticed me when I was buying some coffee and stood behind me I the queue. He said hi and started crying but not saying anything else. Then we went to sit at a table alone and all of our peers were looking at us, they knew what's up and they knew our story. Then we sat at the table. He was crying. He touched my knee and we just sat there in silence for a bit. Then I asked him how is he doing, and he answered he is managing somehow and he is alright. 

I never had a dream like this, it was very emotional. What can it mean? (Especially today around 19th when Pluto leaves Capricorn) Does it signify any type of closure? Has anyone had similar dream? What can it mean? Thank you for help.",1,1732024606.0,Dreams,1,1.0,False

I had a terrible relationship with food. Eating late at night, absolutely loved sugar, and loved nothing more than a big glass of juice in the morning. I love to cook, so meals were rarely processed foods, but the snacks… ooooh how I loved to snack.

Usually sticking to 1-2 larger meals per day now, sticking to meat (of all varieties), butter, eggs, water and coffee and mostly salt for seasoning. I mix sugar free seasonings from time to time to keep things interesting.  

Heart burn is considerably better (except for when I use too much cayenne), I almost never  have flatulence (which is wild lol), and BMs happen usually every other day (no discomfort though in between). 

It’s been a crazy lifestyle shift, but I feel great. I started this diet for a few reasons, but ultimately my goal was to improve both my physical and mental health. Outside of being cheerfully chubby and heavy like a Chevy, I didn’t have any serious health issues (that I’m aware of) that needed correcting. 

I keep up with carnivore content to keep me motivated, and every day I feel more and more committed to keeping the diet clean. I will say I do look forward to a cheat meal… and I’ll know when it’s the right time to have one. 

Carnivore on y’all 🤙🏻

I am sorry if this does not belong here, as it is largely about a non-relationship (more like a situationship?).

I (40f) have been 'casually dating' for a few years. None of the people I date and I ever become serious. This is on purpose, and everybody involved is aware and consenting. I have never had issues with this dynamic.

Onto the issue at hand; I'm currently seeing Mathias (42M) who is happy with this situation. It's been a few months and all was well until he threw me on a loop this weekend and I am still unsure how to deal with it.

So, Mathias is from a country in the Americas, whereas I am from a country in Europe, and we both reside in a country in Europe which is not my homecountry. I know that where he is from, the following things are common: asking your partner not to have friends of the opposite gender, not hanging out with the opposite gender alone, and sharing your location. However, where I am from, as well as in many nearby countries (don't want to speak for everyone, so I am only speaking for countries in which I have lived/know lots of locals), any of these things would be considered very, very unhinged. Of course, not counting special circumstances, such as “don't have dinner with this person who keeps hitting on you”, or “share your location at all times because we live in the woods” or whatever. I must insist that I am not judging anyone here, but here culturally this is not viewed the same at all.

This weekend, Mathias mentioned that he was uncomfortable with me hanging out with one of our mutual friends (a man). After I confirmed he meant that in a “this hurts me because I am insecure about him at a romantic/sexual level”, I asked him if he was serious, since we both sleep with other people and are generally the opposite of committed to each other. He was. I said that's not happening. He was sad, and offered a “compromise”. The compromise: I share my location with him at all times. Not happening either. That's when he started acting as if I am completely unreasonable. I told him it would already be a lot coming from a proper partner, but from a FWB, even with an emphasis on the F? Nope.

So he decided to show me his map of FWBs. Apparently “most” of his friends allow him to see their locations.

Where I need advice: I know a lot of these people (small-ish city, shared industries/hobbies) and I cannot imagine most of them ever agreeing to this. I am not looking for validation as to whether or not I am right to refuse to do the same. Even if this was a thing where we are, I am perfectly comfortable with doing whatever I please to protect my privacy, and my personal relationships. But I really want to reach out to these people to check if they ever agreed to this.

I am hesitating because different reasons: some of them I know and am in good terms with, but I don't know them so well. Some of them are very private people, so I don't want to be breaching their privacy if this turns out to be consensual, etc.

I want to do it anyways because different reasons: One of them is a former coworker who had stalkers in the past. One of them is a neighbour mum I met for coffee a while ago who told me ”Why did you send me your live location on whatsapp? That's creepy af” (I was cycling to her and wasnt able to text so I sent that so she'd know I'm on my way). She then said she wouldnt even track her own children. Etc.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I realised he uses that to accidentally meet people so he can insert himself in events/meetups he is not invited to, and hang out. Which is ... creepy, but well, not criminal. But then in which other ways does he use people's locations to engineer the desired social hangouts?

The Previous Homeowners Journals

Hello everyone, I recently purchased a new home. It's newly renovated and in a prime location. However, the previous homeowners left the house a mess; apparently, they were in a rush and left a lot of their crap behind. While tossing out their stuff, some notebooks, scraps of paper, and other junk fell out of a box, and you can say curiosity got the best of me. I decided to read through some of it. The first couple of notepads were filled with notes and electrical stuff—I guess the previous owner was an electrician or something. However, right before I was ready to call it quits and toss it all out, I came across a notebook with a short story in it. I noticed that throughout all the notebooks and pads, there were random jots and blurbs. Some of the writing is rushed and hard to read, but as I piece this story together, I decided I'd share it here! It’s all a mess though; a lot of writing was probably done in the spur of the moment. Sadly, we never got to meet the sellers at closing, so we won't be able to give this back; they apparently had already left the state before we closed.

Anyway, I'll be releasing the story as I compile it. Let me know what you think, and if you think you know the authors, please let me know! I’d love to return their work. Anyway, here it is!

Chapter 1: The Dream

My cheeks twitched slightly as the black haze of sleep started to lift. A soft groan left my throat as I stretched my neck to a more comfortable position. I heard my wife moving as well—the comfortable shuffling sound that bed sheets make. She just couldn't seem to get comfortable though, as the grogginess cleared up and sleep was leaving me entirely. “Are you okay?” I mumbled, putting my arm around her, annoyed that my sleep was ruined. My waking ears kept twitching as they focused in on the sound. It was a soft shuffling sound—swish-pull-step-swish-pull-step. Maybe my wife Selene was going to the bathroom, I thought, as I gently tightened my arms around her warm, tender frame.

My eyes jutted open, and my body tensed; I felt my skin crawl as my brain shocked itself awake. My mind began spinning with realization—even if she was shuffling to the bathroom, our master bathroom is right here. Right in front of the bed. That isn't much of a walk. And she's lying right next to me. In my arms. Gently snoring. Not moving a single inch. My ears zoned in. Was this a mouse? An animal? No... No, this wasn't a mouse—it wasn't any kind of small animal! I don't have to be an audio expert with perfect hearing to know that this noise is not animalistic at all.

After a few seconds, I realized we were being burglarized. Someone was in my home right now at this very moment. My home is a ranch—everything is one floor. Selene and I are first-time homeowners and have been living here in perfect suburbia for five months—a stark contrast to our chaotic environment in the city. The house is practically open-concept, with a hallway from the living room leading straight to our master bedroom. Admittedly, most sounds breaking the silence tend to scare us in our newfound environment. Our refrigerator loves popping out random ice cubes like mini gunshots, and Selene's been having it the hardest with random noises. This wouldn't be the first time something crazy has happened to us.

And now I heard what sounded like shuffling in the living room.

The creak and groan of our wood floors matched with the constant slow footsteps. It sounded like someone was searching around for something in short distances—an item that kept eluding them. I heard the pillows on the couch bump around and the coffee table move as my ears continued to zone in. My heart started to pound heavily, and I felt a tightness around my chest.

Slowly, and as quietly as possible, I leaned over to my nightstand and opened it to grab my handgun. As panic continued to swell in my chest, my wife started shifting and waking up, whether due to me or the intruder I don't know, and I quickly shushed her with my hand over her mouth. She's feisty and immediately gave me an angry look, probably more upset to be jarred awake. Selene tends to jump to conclusions without thinking— a headstrong woman with a strong personality, but she's also an amazing partner and knows exactly what to do when I'm serious. She motions to speak, but stays quiet once she notices the gun in my hand.

""There's someone in our living room, or at least I think,"" I whisper as lowly as I can, slowly and quietly heading over to unlock the bedroom door. I carefully opened the door, leaving it slightly ajar to avoid making noise, and made my way down the hallway. My wife was sitting on the bed with her phone in hand, probably calling the police.

In hindsight, I should have stayed in the bedroom and let the police handle this situation; however, I can be quite a brave idiot.

My heart was pounding hard as the warm sensation of blood rushed to my face. Growing up in the city, I found myself in many dangerous situations, but I never could have realized how much more terrifying it was to have an intruder in your home in the early morning. As I crept closer, I saw the hunched back of a figure wearing a black tank top and baggy black shorts. My coffee table blocked the view from his calves down. The figure had pale white skin—seemingly Caucasian, maybe even albino—and its bent-over frame had its hands in the crevices of my couch. It wore either a tight black beanie or maybe it had a thick buzzcut; the distance was too far to be certain. I wondered what it expected to find in my couch; certainly it wasn't looking for dust bunnies or loose change.

Slowly walking closer, I aimed my firearm at the intruder; the floor creaked under me. He stood up quickly, startled, his head whipping in my direction to look directly at me as the rest of him slowly turned around. As he turned, everything about him seemed to shift, almost shimmering in the light streaming through the bay window blinds, as if he was made out of fine silver-colored sand. His pale skin tone shimmered to a tan tone, and a tattoo morphed on his chest and arms, mimicking the same tattoos on my upper body. I froze, staring at my doppelganger. His body was no longer albino in a black outfit but instead was shirtless, wearing sweatpants, with my messy bed head and hairline—and holding something...

I faced myself. I was holding a firearm, and he was holding what I perceived to be a firearm, but something about it looked off. I took a step. He—I?—took a step. I walked toward him. He did the same. I stopped a short distance away, and he mimicked me. My chest pounded as my reflection's face grew slightly red. I can only imagine that was how I looked. My breathing was calm yet heavy. So was his, but without the sound of breaths being taken. I took a step backward, aimed at him, and he mimicked each movement until he backed into the coffee table and fell.

I took this opportunity and fired off six bullets into him, five making their mark. I almost feared I might feel the pain myself.

My wife ran down the hall to see the scene unfolding. “Please tell me you're seeing what I'm seeing,” I pleaded. My wife confirmed my sanity. “Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, what the hell is that? What the hell is this? What is going on?”

“CALM DOWN,” my mirror image screamed, and I fired two more rounds into him.

The silence stood heavy in the air.

“That was not your voice,” my wife stated as we watched blood pour out of him—more like sand flowing out of a vial than liquid. My body lurched forward as my name, “CASSIAN!” screamed out. My neck was punctured by two rows of teeth, and my doppelganger was standing back up.

Fear immediately struck my heart as I went to grab the being behind me and—BEEP BEEP BEEP—my morning alarm was going off. My heart was pounding, my body soaked in sweat. My wife groaned, “Turn off the alarm, Cassian.” I turned off the alarm and stood up—the pounding in my chest dissipating as I realized that all I went through was a vivid dream. I checked the magazine to my firearm and counted fifteen bullets. All was well… Just a horrible dream. I went to the bathroom, washed my face, and wrote every detail I remembered down as my wife woke up. I began telling Selene about the dream as I jotted it down in my brown notepad. Reliving it through speech actually helped with jotting everything down.

“That's got to mean something; maybe we should play the lottery?” Selene joked as she went to shower.

Ahh, Selene. She believes in astrology, mythical things, and that rocks and essential oils can influence a person or put them to sleep, but she won’t believe me.

We got prepared for work. I normally work remotely, but today I was heading down to Philadelphia for a survey. As I put my coat on and made my way toward the kitchen to make my morning coffee before heading to my car, I decided to take a moment and stare into the living room. Everything looked utterly normal. Nothing changed. No evidence of an attack.

Nothing.

And that, my friends, is what he has written down on the first page of this notebook. The next pages seem to be notes jotted down for an office in 16th and Market Street; no idea where that’s at though. If you'd like to hear more of this story, let me know; I think it's kind of creepy because I can personally visualize it a bit since, ya know, I live here and obviously this house was his inspiration.

Edit: Hey, I decided to peek around the living room, and I noticed a hole in the floor—it looks to be patched by some wood putty and revarnished.. refinished? I don't know. Maybe I’m being paranoid, but could bullet holes be that easy to fix? I never owned a gun before, I only know about them from movies. Maybe it’s actually just a knot in the wood, and I’m being paranoid. I think I’ll be reading a bit more of these journals in case this is something else. I don't know; let me know what you think. I'll put a picture in the comments or something when I get a chance! 

The Rivera Journals PT2

Hello everybody! So I pieced together more of the story and man is it compelling! It felt a bit like an auto-horror-biography at first, but this is getting pretty deep! 

I’m still looking around the house for bullet holes and crap from the first few pages and I found a few interesting things, could be nothing though I have no idea.

Otherwise, stay awhile, and listen!

Or well, read…

Anyways, let me know what you think!!

Chapter 2: The Site visit 

Until something shiny caught my eye…

I groaned, a tightness building in my chest as I tried to focus. The surreal feelings from the nightmare flooded back—was that really just a dream? My eyes darted to the source of the glint, something pulling at my attention like a magnet. My thoughts scattered like marbles, racing off in different directions, none of them making any sense.

Should I go to work? Will it find me at work? Should I see what this sparkle is? Was it a dream? Is this still a dream? Could it be… one of the brass casings?

Slowly, I turned my head toward the shine, my feet moving before I could stop them, drawn closer one step at a time. The air thickened, each breath heavier than the last. Something told me that whatever lay ahead could change everything... No, it would change everything.

Except it didn’t.

The world tilted just for a moment, the mental fog lifting enough for me to recognize the object for what it was.

My wife’s necklace.

A heart-shaped pendant, delicate and familiar, dangled from a thin silver chain. I’d seen it countless times—practically a souvenir from a cruise long ago—but finding it on the living room floor felt wrong. A chill crept over me, made worse by my phone’s sudden alarm. I looked down. “6:45 AM / GonnaBL8GetGoin,” reminding me I should follow Selene’s lead and head to work for the day.

My hour and a half drive down to the site was a blur, my mind snagging on fragments of the nightmare—the creature wearing my face. I could still feel the phantom pain of its teeth in my neck. At every red light, my hand instinctively reached for Selene’s pendant. Something about it felt off—too pristine. Too shiny, as if untouched. Selene always kept her jewelry neatly organized and tucked away, yet here I was clutching it like a relic found on the floor.

A blaring horn yanked me from my daze.

“Move it, asshole! Green light!” a man’s voice shouted, angry, as a chorus of honking followed. My hands gripped the wheel too tightly, the pendant cold in my grasp as I hit the gas, sending the car lurching toward my destination.

 I parked in a dingy garage on the same block of 18th and Market St. I grabbed my survey bag, my iPad, and took a good look at my neck before staring at the pendant. Everything just feels so off, but it’ll have to wait.

""Better leave that here,"" I mumbled to myself, setting it in the center console and away from prying eyes.

I made my way out of the lot toward my destination—an empty apartment building they were converting into an office complex.

The security guard at the building entrance barely acknowledged me as I signed in. The fluorescent lights buzzed faintly overhead, casting a dim, flickering glow across the deserted lobby. The empty space had a strange, uneasy stillness. Time to be an engineer.

""Where are Matt and Klara? I'm usually the one who's tardy to the party,"" I muttered, noting items for demolition and marking fixtures to be removed.

Half an hour passed, and I was still alone. The silence weighed on me, pressing into my chest. My mind wandered back to the pendant in the car.

""I should call Tommy..."" I thought, though I hated the idea of tattling on my coworkers to my boss.

Cassian: ""Hey, Tommy… So um, Matt and Klara didn’t show up yet,” his voice shakier than he expected it to be, “are they still coming down?""

Thomas (laughing): ""Told you to ride with them! Should've kept the miles on the company car.""

Cassian: ""Ha. Ha. Yeah, hindsight’s 20/20,"" Tommy’s joke eased the foreboding feeling building in the pit of Cassian’s stomach.

Thomas: “Let me give them a call, give me a few”, the line goes silent as Thomas puts him on a brief hold.

Thomas: “They didn’t pick up, tell you what, give them both a call in a few minutes and let me know what happens”.

Cassian: “Yeah… Sounds good”

Thomas: ""Hey uhh, you don’t sound so well Cass, everything alright?”

Cassian: “Heh, didn’t sleep well you can say”, Cassian said truthfully.

Thomas: “Well anyway, keep me in the loop an—""

Suddenly, a scratchy, chilling scream echoed down the hall.

Thomas: ""What the hell was that, Cassian?""

Cassian: ""I... I don't know. I think it came from the hallway toward the main entrance...""

Thomas: ""Is everything okay?""

Thomas can hear Cassian’s shuffling and some non-understandable speech.

Thomas: “Cassian?”

There’s a loud clack as the phone is dropped on the ground, and a few more thudding sounds.

Thomas: “Uhhh… Cassian?”

An explosion of noise erupted from the line, and then silence. Thomas doesn’t understand what happened. An explosion? Or maybe a lot of movement?

Thomas tried calling back several times, but each attempt went straight to voicemail.

""Uhh, shit,"" he whispered to himself, his hands trembling as he dialed 9-1-1.

Operator: ""9-1-1, how may I help you?""

Thomas: ""Yes, hello, my name is Thomas Hertz. I’m calling about my employee, Cassian, who’s at 1818 Market St in Philadelphia. We were on the phone, and there was a scream, then the line went dead. I can't reach him.""

Operator: ""Okay, 1818 Market St, Philadelphia… dispatching someone to check up—""

A sharp click cut through the line.

A new voice, calm yet unsettling, spoke:

""Hello, Mr. Hertz. I wasn’t expecting you.""

Thomas froze, his heart pounding as every hair on the back of his neck rose.

Voice: ""Consider this your only warning.""

The line went dead.

Thomas looked at his phone and slowly put it down. He opened his laptop, pulling up the news, zoning into anything recent in Center City, but finding nothing except traffic updates and minor incidents.

A thought came to Thomas's mind. “Maybe I should call his wife…”

After a few rings.

Selene: ""Hello, Selene Estrada speaking.""

Thomas: ""Hello, Selene, this is your husband’s boss, Tommy Hertz. Nice to make your acquaintance.""

Selene: ""Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Hertz. What can I do for you?"" Confusion was apparent in her voice.

Thomas: ""Could you give your husband a call?"" He hesitated, deciding to keep the specifics vague. ""We were on the phone earlier, but the connection suddenly cut out, and I haven’t been able to reach him. Just want to check in and make sure everything’s okay.""

Selene: ""Uh, sure. I'll call him and get back to you if I hear anything.""

They hung up, and Selene dialed Cassian’s number, but it didn’t even ring—it sent her straight to voicemail.

She tried three more times, then sent him a text.

Selene text: ""Hey, pick up. Your boss called for you.""

Selene text: ""He's worried about you."" She bit her lip. Admittedly, she was worried about him too.

She called once more.

Selene text: ""Is everything okay?""

Cassian text: ""Stop calling me.""

Selene text: ""Then just pick up.""

Cassian text: ""Stop.""

Selene text: ""What do you mean, 'Stop'?""

Cassian text: ""You know exactly what I mean, bitch.""

Selene froze, staring at her phone. This struck her as extremely odd. But it didn’t stop the surge of anger that rose in her.

Selene text: ""You never call me a bitch. What the hell is wrong with you?""

Cassian text: ""Drop it now, or you’ll regret it.""

Her fingers hovered over her phone screen as she typed, ""Cassian, if you don’t stop talking to me this way, I swear I’ll—"" but her message was interrupted by a response before she could hit send.

Cassian text: ""I’ll talk to you however I damn well please.""

A moment passes and her phone lights up again.

Cassian text: “Stop calling. It’s for your own good.”

Selene’s fingers tremble over the screen, as she typed out, “what do you mean”, but never hit send.

Cassian text: “Don’t worry about what I mean.”

The response stopped her cold.
Her anger melted into a dull, uneasy fear.
She deleted her message and immediately dialed Thomas.

Selene: ""Hello, Mr. Hertz,"" she said quickly.

Thomas: ""Hey, Selene. Did you manage to get through to him?""

Selene: ""I did... sort of.""

Thomas: ""That's goo—""

Selene: ""It's not him texting me."" She said cutting him off before he could finish.

 

The line went silent.

Selene: ""He called me a bitch, he’s texting really out of character, and… Well, it’s like he’s psychic. I'm really worried. Is everything okay?"" she said that last part, even though she knew nothing was okay.

Thomas: ""To be honest, Selene, I have no idea."" He paused, the weight of what he’d heard earlier settling in.

Selene: ""What do you mean?""

Thomas: ""When he called me, he asked about two other coworkers who hadn’t shown up yet. Then suddenly, I heard screaming from his end, followed by something that sounded like..."" Thomas hesitated, wondering if he should even say it.

Selene: ""Sounded like?""

Thomas: ""It sounds crazy, but... it was an explosion? Or explosive noise at least. I called him back, but no answer. I called 9-1-1 after that. The operator took down my report, but then…"" He swallowed, trying to make sense of it himself. “Well, the line went dead, and a voice—a creepy, metallic voice—came through, threatening me.”

There was another pause. Selene’s silence mirrored his own confusion and fear.

Thomas: ""Actually... I just had an idea, and... Selene, I’m sorry.""

Selene: ""Sorry? For what?""

Thomas: ""I don’t know yet.""

Thomas hung up, unable to say goodbye or continue the conversation. He felt a cold unease settle over him as he stared at his phone. His hands trembled slightly as he dialed both Matt and Klara, but neither picked up.

Then he called the Project Manager.

Tony: ""Anthony Maggiliccio speaking.""

Thomas: ""Hey Tony, how are things going?""

Tony: ""Just about any other day, ya know.""

Thomas: ""Haha, gotcha. Hey, quick question—did any of my guys show up today at 1818 Market?""

Tony: ""Let me call the guard shack and see.""

Thomas was put on a brief hold.

Tony: ""Only Cassian Rivera, your EE, showed up.""

Thomas shuddered. ""No one else?""

Tony: ""Nahhh.""

Thomas: ""So, I was on the phone with Cassian when there was a scream, and then the line went dead. Did the guards mention anything? Think you can have one of them check up on him?""

Tony: ""Yeah, sure, bub. I'll get Desean on it.""

Thomas: ""Thanks, man. Oh, and could you tell the guards to let me know if Matt or Klara show up? Thank you.""

Tony: ""You got it, Tom.""

They hung up.

""Yo, Tams, Tony wants one of us to go check on the short guy,"" Desean yelled over to his coworker.

""The construction dude from earlier? Why, what's up?"" Tammy asked, walking over after just finishing in the porta-john.

""Yeah, just go check up on him and keep the walkie-talkie on. Tony also said to let him know if any other surveyors come by this jawn.""

Tammy reluctantly walked toward the darkened entrance, “that’s wild, the lights are off, how he gonna see,” she muttered, flicking on her flashlight as she entered the eerie silence. She looked at the dirty light switch, flipping it up and down with no result, “that motherfucker really got me up in here in the dark, I should get him to do this,” Tammy complained. ""Guess they turned off the power. Ain’t my business, I think it’s a waste of money anyway.” Tammy grumbled as she continued on, “I wonder what this place is gonna be—lawyer's office or something?” Tammy kept mumbling, her voice filling the quiet space as she made her way down the corridor.

She sniffed the air, ""Nah this place smells clinical, what he do spray lysol on everything? Preppin' it to be a doctors or some shit?"" she murmured on while walking down the halls, ""Hey, Cass-see-ann? You 'round here?"" She stumbled over his name. ""Cash-shennnnnnnnnn... come on, man, it’s dark in here. Watchu doin' in the dark?"" The silence hung thickly, and Tammy felt a prickle of unease run down her spine. Her keys jingled as she nervously adjusted her belt. She reached for her walkie-talkie. ""Hey, Desean, ain't nobody in—"", a soft scraping noise reverberated from further down the hallway, hidden in shadow. She aimed her flashlight and squinted, trying to make out a shape moving in the darkness.

 “You were sayin’ Tams?”, Desean chimed in, “One sec it’s dark as shit in here,” Tammy replied.

As Tammy turned the corner, she froze, her flashlight beam catching a pale face with an eerie, unsettling smile. Staring back at her were eyes like glacial ice – an intense and unnatural shade of blue glowed in the darkness. Tammy froze, recognizing those eyes from earlier, but the expression he held was just all wrong: unblinking, fixed, and far too still. Standing only a few feet away, his disturbing glare was vacant and all-consuming. Those were the engineers eyes, socketed in the face of a shade playing pretend.

Tammy’s heart pounded as she instinctively edged backward, her flashlight revealing more of the scene. “You ain’t the…” she clears her throat,” You ain’t the short white guy I’d seen earlier, who are you”, Tammy said, gaining her confidence back. He was clean-shaven, unmoving, and his expression… why was he just standing there, smiling like that? Just a few steps away lay a survey bag, tools scattered around it, and the iPad Cassian had been using was halfway across the room, its screen dark. ""Sir?"" Her voice was barely a whisper, trembling. The silence that answered was broken only by the faint hum of the air vent above, which seemed to grow louder in the stillness, mocking her.

“Watchu mean dark? The lights should be on Tams,” Desean’s voice broke through the walk-talkie. Tammy’s fingers fumbled for her walkie-talkie as she kept her eyes locked on the figure, slowly backing away, his piercing perfectly blue eyes staring at her, his pupils swelling, but never blinking. ""Desean, call the police and get Tony. Now."" But as she ended the message, she blinked—and the man was gone.

And the lights were on.

And it smelled old and musty, like an old cleared out office space should smell.

“Watchu say Tams? I didn’t catch that.” Her breath caught in her throat as she took in the suddenly bright, musty corridor. The empty hallway stretched out ahead, completely silent, as if nothing had been there at all.

No strange man.
No survey tools or iPad.
No Cassian Rivera.

Tammy’s hands shook, and she clutched her walkie-talkie tighter, feeling her pulse thudding in her ears.

“Tams!” Desean almost yelled.
Tammy felt the color return to her face, as her body tingled all over from a strong endorphin release.

“Call the police man, I don’t like this shit. You ain’t gonna believe what I just saw.”

So, I’m taking matters into my own hands. People NEED to know about this travesty.

While I was in the breakfast area, mad chillin’, excited for a peaceful morning, I encountered a tragedy in buffet form. The eggs were screaming for help—dry, rubbery, and lifeless—and the bacon was running away from the concept of crispness altogether. The coffee? Tasted like muddy water.

But here’s where things truly went off the rails.

I asked a staff member if they had any fresh croissants because the ones on display were basically croutons. Her response? “What’s out is what we have.” EXCUSE ME? What kind of dystopian nonsense is that? I didn’t pay for this room to eat rejected airplane snacks. I have never been more shaken up.

AND IT GOT WORSE.

When I politely asked for a second packet of vegimite for my toast, this SAME staff member gave me a death glare and said, “We’re out. You should’ve gotten here earlier.” OUT OF VEGEMITE. At a BREAKFAST BUFFET. I nearly lost my mind fuzz.

What if someone else was depending on that vegimite? What if this lack of vegimite ruined my entire toast experience, which it DID? I’ve never felt so disrespected, so abandoned in my time of need.

a friend of mine i used to see a lot has been ghosting me for 6 months + now but would always justify that by the fact that they are depressed and I would just leave it at that, because I already knew. whenever I was downtown, I would offer her to hangout, grab coffee or just visit her at her apartment because I knew that going on a walk or just talking to a friend would make her feel better and sometimes she would accept, sometimes she would decline ; I would always respect her space.

however, she's just stopped responding in the last few months, not call me back or anything. as it happened to me sometimes, I didn't think anything of it but it turns out that she was actually going out quite a lot with some of her new friends and even SOME OF MINE that I introduced her to (because she was pretty isolated and shy so I would invite her to a lot of parties, picnics and such, even introduce her to some new friends I would make).

I gradually got upset by it and asked her a few times if anything was wrong and she would always say everything was fine, but would never follow through. I even lived in the *same street* as her for a while because I was keeping a friend's dog and no news. I would always hear about her going out, some friends of mine running into her at parties and such. she used to not drink/smoke and now she does and I always hear stories about her being worryingly fucked up at events. being depressed is one thing but you having time to go out with everyone but me is something else (I would hear about a friend of mine seeing her out every week-end).

I had a very very hard year as well but still tried to show up for her and I ended up feeling fucking stupid for doing so, when in hindsight she didn't seem to worry that much about me. I went through a breakup, had to move out of my apartment, deal with very heavy family stuff but she wasn't really there for me. I sent her voice notes in which I was clearly upset and explained how everything was perceived on my end and even though I said I knew she wasn't doing well multiple times, now she's upset that I'd doubt her mental health struggles, saying I implied that she was faking it (which I never did) and that my tone was mean.

I apologized for my tone, stating that indeed I could've worded my concerns in a calmer way but it didn't really change that I felt she neglected out friendship and that I was worried about her well being. it's been a month and she hasn't answered and since then, she hung out with a friend of mine and she told her that my tone really hurt her and that now that she's not a people pleaser anymore she wasn't going to apologize. am i fucking crazy?

I feel used, really stupid and hurt. what the fuck did I do wrong?

Now I watched Northerlion's playthrough and he immediately compared Kaysen to John Goodman in Barton Fink (a wandering salesman and the main character's nice hotel room neighbour >!who's implied to be the devil!<) so this influenced my opinion a bit, but still.

Do you think Kaysen was meant to be an obvious villain to take the attention off George?

I have a cat (very orange behavior). I start every day with black coffee. I leave dim lights on when I go to bed. I’m better at starting new things than continuing old ones. I’ve probably walked around all the streets in my area, which is upsetting. Sometimes, I try to imagine the taste of blood in my mouth. YT video essays are pretentious (like so many other things today), but I love them. I cut my own hair. More than anything, I love the sensation of buying or using a new detergent or soap, or doing laundry. I prefer memorizing new words by writing them on paper hundreds of times rather than swiping through digital flashcards. I never talk to my neighbors. I avoid looking in mirrors in the dark. I only buy Irish whiskey. I don’t pick up the phone unless my best friend is calling. I read better on long train rides. I leave unopened envelopes on my desk for days before dealing with them.

Nov 11, 8 AM - First flight was Delhi to Kochi, Vistara - priority checkin, extra baggage, priority luggage was all followed. The crew was discussing a party for 11th evening considering the last day of work before merger. 

Used Centurion for the first time, wonderful experience, great service and variety. 

The flight took off on time, food and service was great and landed on time as well. 

Nov 11, 9 PM - Kochi to Bengaluru, One of the last flights of Vistara. All silver benefits received but flight was late by a hour. 

Kochi lounge was a surprise to say the least, the place was huge with a view of the runway. The spread was superb and they had a live dosa counter, absolutely amazing!

Nov 13, 6:30 AM - Bengaluru to Mumbai, a new dawn arises, woke up to a message from Air India that Maharaja benefits are in place and Bengaluru airport did not disappoint. Got priority checkin, extra baggage, free seat in front row or economy and priority boarding as well with Silver Status. 

Bengaluru T2 is beautiful, the lounge is really well made and has a very smooth checkin process, multiple coffee options and a dosa live counter again for the win! 

Flight on time, landed on time in Mumbai. 

Nov 15, 11 PM - Mumbai to Delhi, to my utter surprise Mumbai airport was really bad. No check in counters for Maharaja Status nor for priority checkin. Trainees managing counters and everyone taking at least 4-5 minutes to checkin. 

Unfortunately due to time constraints couldn’t visit Centurion as that was on the other end so ended up visiting Adani Lounge (Tip - Head for the one farther from the entrance area, lesser crowd) 

Had a nice cup of coffee and headed for boarding only to be told flight is late by 45min to an hour. 

All in all a good experience and was able to see the merger first hand, pilots mostly kept saying Vistara so I think that’ll take time 😂 

Some hiccups here and there but hoping the new dawn of AI lives up to the hype!

1gux0a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1gux0a8/barista_blues_vent/,Barista Blues (vent) ,"Hi guys, this is probably going to be an annoying pity party, but I just really want to function better!!!!! 

So, some background,
I’ve been working for about a month so far and you’d think I’d have my shit together but I don’t. I’d also like to state that this is my 2nd job ever and I only started working in July of this year. I wasn’t able to work for a plethora of reasons, including letting my severe depressive disorder eat at my brain without any real external stimuli (ie. school, work, club) since I graduated high school (last June) and my OCD —which makes my anxiety feel mentally and physically pulverizing at points— has gotten increasingly worse since I haven’t been able to be treated. 

I just moved back to my home state this past summer. I was in a different country on a visitors visa for almost 4 years because of a work decision my mother made while I was still a minor. I graduated secondary school there but was unable to work for about a year. Which sucked. We ended up getting evicted from our townhouse because our landlord was a dick (shocker!) so my whole immediate family and I moved back to the states. I was really excited because I’d finally be making my own money and I’d be able to afford to do stuff I really want (see my long distance partner, go out to eat, make more art) but I’ve never handled my own money before this due to my parents having to helicopter a very mentally unstable and ill child/teen/young adult their entire parenthoods. 

So there I am; moved back, finally working my first job and it’s great! It’s just a crew position at a burger restaurant but I made way more than min wage and I felt good actually having something to do. Unfortunately my manager and 2 shift managers were verbally abusive and talked about me behind my back due to me being trans. I put in my two weeks after 2 and a half months. I luckily was talking to a very close friend of mine that was already a sb partner. I ask them if there are still any openings at their job and they tell me yes and they get their manager to essentially hire me. 

So now it’s October, I picked up my aprons and I start working on my modules before actual training. My trainer was/is just completely useless. She was extremely rude about me being trans and even tried to proselytize during our conversations and brought up Israel and I felt extremely uncomfortable. She didn’t show me standard at all, and we didn’t even USE THE MODULES!!!! LIKE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO! She would just show me “her way” of doing things. I remember wasting two whole whips on my 3rd day just because I wasn’t “doing whipped cream right” (I was mainly on shake station at my first job— I know what I’m doing girl) she was mad about the way I held my wrists. She was mad about the way I wiggled my wrist around when I was trying to read the very vast POS system for the first times. She called me a “spaz” several times for shit like this (I have autism and low tone was a very difficult issue I had growing up, I don’t exactly physically function normally) and it genuinely pissed me off. I never said anything bad about her to anyone directly, but we don’t have any shifts together ever for a reason I guess! (She can’t fucking train people!!!) I still feel scared around her when I do happen to see her in lobby or something.

So now it’s been a month and I’m still asking so many useless questions like “how do I make cold brew again?” and “how many pumps of ___ goes into a _____?” When I should already know them. I can’t even memorize the way our mats are layed out behind bar when I put them back after mopping. I feel really stupid and angry that I didn’t have the chance to have better jobs before this and also have a better training experience, because now I feel like I’m just dragging my fellow baristas down, yknow? I am almost always disheartened each time I’m at work. I constantly look towards my SSVs for help and it’s lowkey embarrassing for me. Everyone knows my trainer sucked ass so I’m getting a liiiiittle leeway for that, but… It’s still really embarrassing for me. 

There’s a supervisor who shit talked me to my friend (the one who got me this job in the first place) outside of work and she said “he’s just making my job harder and he’s really slow” and I definitely do understand her saying that. She’s also a coffee master and has been working for over 7 years. She said that the night after we worked my first Saturday peak together and I thought I did a good job, but she apparently felt like I didn’t do good. She even high-fived me when I clocked out. The thing is I know I shouldn’t care deep down, but I’m so chronically anxious and upset with myself that I’ve become paranoid about ruining my coworkers’ lives. (Or at least making their jobs harder than they should be.)

I’ve cried only once during my shift so far which is SURPRISING!!! And I sucked it back up really quickly and I survived but man, I feel like a moron. Everything I do at this job feels half-assed and bad even though I’m putting my all into it. As corny as it sounds I really try to prioritize SB’s values and I try to be the best partner I can. Customers hate me probably because I’m autistic and have a hard time with tone and volume and memory and I could go on and on and on…. You get my point. I’ve been in a haze for the past few weeks.. I just turned 20 about a week ago and I was pretty sick for about 10 days. I managed to go in one day (my birthday) but the morning after I literally could not breathe normally and I was throwing up and I JUST got better. I was gone about a week. Today was my first day back and I felt like an idiot. I did several things incorrectly as per usual but it felt so bad. I don’t want to sound self-deprecating, I’m just a little defeated. Maybe in April/May I can ask for a transfer to a location with slower traffic and less customers? Our store is the highest rated location in our area —maybe I might be better off at a slower location. I feel like I’m fast paced enough because I haven’t been fired or warned by my SM yet!!!! 

Anyways I just wanted to see if anyone could sympathize or give any advice whatsoever or even give me guff for my bullshit. Thank you if you read this far, I hope you’re having a better week than I am 💚

One of them, I think it was from the 70s or 80s, was about this elderly husband and wife in Ancient Arabia. They are portrayed as bumbling and forgetful. While they're cooking some sort of meat or stew, they learn that their daughter got married to a rich man, so they go to visit her. They encounter some kind of criminal, and foolishly tell him that they keep their key under the welcome mat. The criminal goes to their house and eats all the meat. The couple arrive at their daughter's place, and instantly start shenanigans, getting themselves covered in tar that they mistake for lotion, annoy everyone at dinner by complaining about the coffee, and accidentally kill all of the livestock with steam. Eventually, the daughter has enough of their antics and sends them away, giving them scarves as a gift; however, the duo end up giving the scarves to either some birds or the trees because ""they were cold"". When they get home, they find all the food is gone and assume that a nearby fly is somehow responsible. The husband grabs a broom to kill the fly, but ends up hitting his wife on the head.

1guwx0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1guwx0y/my_ultimate_pcos_guide/,My ultimate PCOS guide,"I have been following this polish dietitian on ig for a few months (I'm from Poland), I applied a few changes here and there and I've seen major results! My periods got regular, I'm less bloated, I even became quite regular in the bathroom 😅 and there's a lot more! I don't think I've seen such an informative account in English so I wanted to share some tips with you bc I feel like I know stuff that all pcos girlies should know.

There's actually a lot so I'll just start from describing some alterations in my daily life.

I try to sleep for at least 8h but 9h would be even better. I measure my temperature (I'll get back to it later) and then I start from a warm water with collagen and ginger ice cube that I make once every few weeks by just blending ginger, lemon, turmeric and black pepper with a bit of water. Then I make my breakfast, what's important is that it needs to be high in protein. Usually it's 2 eggs wrap with avocado/ oats with cinnamon, chia seeds and protein powder/ 3 spoons of flax seeds blended and then cooked with almond milk, cinnamon and protein powder. -> ginger, lemon, cinnamon are good antioxidants - we need to get rid of the inflammation in our body.

After 3-4h I have lunch. I'll eat anything as long as its high in fiber and protein.

And then after 5-6h I have dinner. I still try to keep it high in protein but here I allow myself for more carbs as they allow you to get a better sleep.

If I feel like I had too much carbs or I had sth with sugar then I'd go for a walk or even walk around the house (I work from home so I really need to try hard to get my steps 😂) to lower down the glucose/insulin.

Supplements:

This is personal and it should be adjusted individually but I'll say what works well for me and what's my absolute minimum:

\- **Vit d3** after breakfast

\- **omega 3** after breakfast

\- **B complex** in the morning bc it can make you more energized

\- **Magnesium** 2h before sleep bc it has a 'calming' effect. Good for periods cramps and helps with absorption of other vitamins.

\- **zinc**

\- **myo-inositol** 30min before sleep bc it can extend the REM sleep (should be myo:d-chiro in proporsion 40:1)

On top of that I also take sodium **sodium butyrate** and I'm starting **lactoferrin** for guts but that's personal. Sometimes if I feel like I'm lacking iron (my hair tends to fall out more before and during period) then I'd take **vitamin c** (1g) before eating sth that's high in iron like beef for example. If I feel like I'm getting sick I'd take 1g of vit c 3 times a day and a lof of vit d.

Other dietary tips:

\- the more protein & healthy fats you eat the less sugar you crave. Healthy fats will not make you fat!

\- in luteal phase and during period cut out on caffeine completely (or if you drink a few coffees cut it to 1) bc we our cortisol tends to be higher

\- you can do seed cycling - eat pumpkin seeds in your folicular phase and sesame.  seeds & sunflower seeds during ovulation and luteal phase.

\- alcohol - personally i dont drink but it causes a huge stress and inflammation to the body so try to cut it out as much as possible

\-  eat more beef just before and during period, you can also have some dark chocolate

\- **during period**: beetroots, berries, red beans, green tea, spearmint tea, dark chocolate, chicken broth, ginger

\- **after period until ovulations**: cabbage, pickled stuff, citrus fruits, oats, kefir

\- **ovulation**: red pepper, coconut, bananas,  red lentils, tuna, chia, matcha, cacao, coconut water

\- **luteal phase**: cauliflower, potatoes, sweet potatoes, apples, dates, dries plums, chickpeas, beef, peppermint, ginger

MEASURING TEMPERATURE:

Honestly earlier I never knew when to expect my period and if you asked me I never knew which phase of the cycle I was in bc of how irregular my cycles were.

I thought that this is the oldest contraception method but turns out i's a lot more than that! I was sick of guessing when my period can come and so I thought I'd give it a try. It took me around 2-3 months to learn the pattern and I'm so glad I tried bc now I always know when my period is about to come and I can be prepared. And it must be super useful when trying to get pregnant.

So basically I measure my temperature under my tongue everyday after waking up max. +/- 30 min of difference and after sleeping at least 5h. So let's say I go to sleep at midnight and I wake up at 8am, I measure it right away as soon as I open my eyes. On weekends if I want to sleep longer it can be 8.30 or if I'm awake to pee at 7.30 then that's also fine. I use digital thermometer from microlife.

So what we are looking for is a 'jump' of temperature of at least 0.2-0.6 degree Celsius , its usually within 3 days. And then the temperature will keep up until your period. With pcos it could be that you are still ovulating if your cycles are long. Even if it's a day 30 - it can still be an ovulation and you can still get pregnant!

If your temperature changes by 0.2 Celsius degree or more everyday that could be a sign high cortisol.

If your temperature is below 36.2 then it could be a sign of lack of nutrients or problems with thyroid.

The temperature will drop down to the one from before ovulation around 1 day before period. - this one is nice bc you know when to expect your period!

At least 18 days of temperature not dropping is the first sign of pregnancy.

To learn to see the pattern I'm sure you can find examples online.

WORKING OUT:

The more is not the better! It's important to keep moving and do weighlifting but it can be hard on our cortisol. So we can do high intensity from follicular phase after period until 1 week after ovulation. In luteal phase stick to yoga or smaller weight with more breaks in between. Don't work out on the first 2-3 days of your period. Also try to hit 5-10k of steps everyday. Like I said earlier it's good to walk for 10-15min after each meal - it helps with lowering the glucose/insulin

OTHER TIPS:  
\- tampons/pads - try to buy 100% cotton ones. Nowadays most of them are full of bleaches and it can really affect our hormones, pms etc.

\- try to eat a lot of different veggies. Maybe every time you go groceries try to buy a veggie that you haven't eaten in a long time. This helped me with being regular with my 💩 thanks to fiber.

\- a carrot in the morning helps with hormonal imbalances

\- try to stay away from screens for 1h before sleep

\- for me dairy and sugar makes my acne a lot worse so i cut on it too. some ppl also cut on gluten, especially if they have endometriosis

\- bone broth is a superfood, cook it if you can and have a cup!

\- if you want to go on a diet then do it in your follicular phase but still make sure you are getting enough of nutrients. eat 300-500 calories more in your luteal phase.

That's all I could think of now but there's a lot more. Let me know if you do any of those things and if they help!",9,1732022315.0,PCOS,2,1.0,False

My boyfriend and I are heading to Japan Jan 4-19 and feeling overwhelmed with choice about where to spend our time! We’re experienced travelers but unsure how much we can fit in; hearing lots of different opinions here & from friends. **We're interested in**:

* Winter-friendly spots with natural beauty
* Cozy onsen towns/ryokans (I have a specific vision of an outdoor bath by a river...)
* Charming places that shine in winter over “must-sees” (although probably not the north on this trip)
* Good vegetarian food (know this might be tricky)
* Seeing Mt Fuji
* Exploring Tokyo beyond touristy stuff, e.g., cute shops, good coffee, charming bars. We might do a TeamLab experience but that's probably it for specific ""attractions"".

**Draft itinerary**:

*Jan 4: Arrive Narita 4pm, head to Tokyo and have dinner.*

*Jan 5: Tokyo for one day to help us adjust & avoid a long evening of travel on the day we fly in. Explore, find good coffee, get our bearings.*

*Jan 6: Shibu Onsen. Visit snow monkey park, stay in a ryokan.*

*Jan 7: Kanazawa. Visit Kenrokuen Garden.*

*Jan 8: Osaka. Visit cat railway cafe! Explore, maybe shop a bit.* 

*Jan 9-11: Kyoto. Explore the city, visit temples, visit Fushimi Inari Shrine, the sake district, parks.*

*Jan 12: Mt. Koya/Nara. Stay in a ryokan, visit the deer park.*

*Jan 13-15: Fly Osaka (Jan 13 morning) to Seoul, Jeju, or Busan; return to Tokyo Jan 15 evening*

*Jan 16-18: Tokyo. Explore a few neighborhoods, shop, go to cafes and bars. Maybe a day trip to Hakone or Kawaguchiko… unless we should stay one night there!?)*

*Jan 19: Depart Tokyo*

I know some spend weeks in one city, so this feels hectic but...is it \*that\* insane? 

Are Shibu Onsen, Kanazawa, Kyoto, and Hakone/Kawaguchiko too similar for us to stay one night in potentially all four? 

The Korea side trip is important to us, as we won't likely have the opportunity again for a long time. We're flexible on it but hoping to make it work.

I had an Aiden from one of the original shipments that came with the 3 extra coffees. (I preorder in April 2024)

After the last iOS update, I would always get a 'connection error' and I tried everything I can possibly think of to get the app to connect - but no luck (per my router - the device is actually on the network)

Also, 2 or 3 times I did receive a brew basket no in error - even though the basket was in.

I contacted Fellow Customer Service, and after going through their troubleshooting steps - they decided to send me out a new Aiden.

It arrived last night. It updated to 1.2.4 - however, the network connectivity behavior is the same. The iOS app always says 'connection failed' but it is showing up on my router's list of connected devices and it received a firmware update to 1.2.4 (not what was pre-installed) and the clock is set .... so it is getting to the Internet even though that app doesn't agree.

But what is different now then my last one is I currently can't add the custom profiles from the original batch of coffees. I tried scanning the QR code from the card that came with my original - it still takes me to a fellows landing page. But on my old Aiden - this was enough to re-add those profiles - I can not get them to add on my new one.

I don't really want Fellows to send another Aiden, as I am somewhat certain that this is a combination of firmware/iOS app issues....but not sure if anyone else has experienced this behavior.

Also - I forgot to mention - prior to the most recent iOS app update (v 1.0.3 - I believe) the app was able to connect to the prior Aiden. - it was only after that last iOS update that I started to experience the 'connection error' on the app on both my old and new Aiden.

1guwvs4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1guwvs4,First marathon this weekend! ,"Hi everyone! I am a 30f and running my first marathon this weekend. I trained my ass of w average mileage of 55mpw, peaking at 65. I mixed in one speed workout and most of my runs were done at an easy pace with the exception to my last three LR and felt pretty great after all three (meaning I fully went about my day afterward and felt like they were a success). I originally was training for a 3:40, but now I feel like I have the ability to go a bit faster... I feel great about my fueling technique.. I just can’t stop overthinking how to execute. I have been tapering the past two weeks. 

My question is, how would you execute this run with the information ? I know I shouldn’t go out
At 8min/mile but I assume it’ll be tempting. Should I stick with the 3:40 pacer and ramp it up at the final 10k (pending I have gas left lol) am I aiming too high ? 

Side note: I naturally have a high HR.. and doesn’t help I drink coffee prior to my runs. ",6,1732022210.0,Marathon_Training,1,0.88,False

(CBDL) Closes on LOI for Potential $8 Million Revenue Cannabis Dispensary,"News Link: [https://www.accesswire.com/944122/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-closes-on-loi-for-potential-8-million-revenue-cannabis-dispensary](https://www.accesswire.com/944122/cbd-life-sciences-inc-cbdl-closes-on-loi-for-potential-8-million-revenue-cannabis-dispensary)

***With the New York cannabis market projected to surpass $5 billion by 2027, this acquisition positions CBDL for exponential revenue growth and expanded market dominance.***

**SCOTTSDALE, AZ / ACCESSWIRE / November 19, 2024 / CBD Life Sciences Inc.** (OTC PINK:CBDL), a pioneering force in the CBD and cannabis industries, is proud to announce the signing of a pivotal Letter of Intent (LOI) to acquire an interest in a cannabis dispensary located in New York. The dispensary, purchased from Market Wave Capital, LLC, is expected to generate $8 million in annual revenue once operational and marks a transformative moment in CBDL's journey toward industry dominance. Pending financing and state regulatory approvals, the dispensary is slated to open its doors within six months, ushering in a new chapter of accelerated growth and profitability.

**A Game-Changing Move in a Booming Industry**

The global marijuana dispensary market is on a meteoric rise, projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.5%, with revenues anticipated to surpass $73.6 billion by 2030. New York, a burgeoning hub for cannabis consumption and sales, presents unparalleled opportunities for growth, thanks to progressive legislation and a rapidly expanding consumer base.

""This acquisition is a monumental milestone for CBD Life Sciences and a testament to our aggressive growth strategy,"" said **Lisa Nelson, President and CEO of CBDL.** ""The dispensary's location in New York positions us at the epicenter of one of the fastest-growing cannabis markets in the world. With projected revenues of $8 million annually, this venture is set to deliver significant value to our shareholders while opening new doors for expansion into adjacent markets.""

**Why This Matters for CBDL and Its Investors**

The dispensary's strategic location in New York provides immediate access to a cannabis market projected to exceed $5 billion in annual sales by 2027. CBDL is seizing this opportunity at a critical juncture in the industry's evolution, aligning itself with the broader movement toward cannabis legalization and normalization.

For investors, this development underscores the company's ability to execute high-impact initiatives while navigating a highly competitive and regulated market. The acquisition not only bolsters CBDL's revenue potential but also establishes a foundation for future ventures in high-demand sectors, including recreational, medical, and hybrid cannabis markets.

Furthermore, the dispensary is expected to serve as a gateway for CBDL to introduce its own product lines into a retail setting, creating cross-promotional opportunities and fostering brand loyalty among a rapidly growing customer base.

**Revenue, Growth, and a Vision for the Future**

With potential revenues of $8 million annually, this acquisition is a significant leap forward for CBDL's financial profile. Beyond the immediate economic impact, this strategic move sets the stage for:

* **Market Diversification:** The dispensary adds a robust revenue stream, complementing CBDL's existing portfolio of CBD products.
* **Future Expansion:** Establishing a foothold in New York lays the groundwork for scaling operations to other states as cannabis legalization continues to gain momentum.
* **Enhanced Shareholder Value:** The dispensary's profitability will drive returns for current shareholders while making CBDL an attractive investment for new stakeholders.

**Strategic Significance**

The acquisition reflects CBDL's forward-thinking approach to growth, as the company positions itself at the intersection of opportunity and innovation. By tapping into the New York cannabis market, CBDL is not just diversifying its portfolio but also creating synergies between its dispensary operations and its existing product lines, including pain creams, nano CBD coffee creamers, and more.

Additionally, the dispensary aligns with CBDL's mission to provide high-quality cannabis solutions while embracing consumer trends and regulatory changes. This move reinforces CBDL's standing as a company that is not only thriving in the present but also building for the future.

**A Call to Shareholders and Future Investors**

""This is only the beginning,"" added Nelson. ""CBDL's strategic direction is clear: growth, innovation, and value creation. The dispensary will act as a springboard for broader ventures, and we are just getting started in leveraging the opportunities this industry offers.""

CBDL invites shareholders and prospective investors to join us on this journey as we solidify our position as a leader in the cannabis and CBD industries. This acquisition underscores our commitment to seizing high-value opportunities and delivering long-term value to our shareholders. More updates to come!",2,1732022185.0,Pennystock,0,1.0,False

Work drained me, gym sessions were half-hearted, and by the time I got home, I just wanted to sit down with a show on while scrolling through my phone. A friend of mine who works as a pharmacist suggested I try this supplement called EndoPump that he uses. It's a natural aphrodisiac that's supposed to improve your overall energy as well. I looked into it and was a bit skeptical at first but saw all the supporting studies they had along with the money back guarantee so thought it was worth a shot.

A couple of weeks in, my wife started commenting on how I seemed “different.” At first, I thought she was talking about my mood or how I was doing things around the house. But she meant everything. Her words, I was more present, more engaged, and let’s just say, more confident in ways I hadn’t been for a while if you know what I mean.

That’s when it hit me, I really did feel different. My energy wasn’t just better; it was consistent. I wasn’t crashing mid-afternoon, and I wasn't getting my coffee cravings. My workouts improved, too, heavier lifts and longer sessions where I wasn't quitting on my self during sets. But the biggest win? Feeling like myself again, the version of me I thought was long gone due to age or the stresses of life.

The best part? It wasn’t just me noticing. My wife’s appreciation was proof enough that this stuff was working. Posting this for anyone else who's in the same position that I was, I don't know if it's a placebo effect or what but it works for me.

A bit of background: the house is a brick home in the Chicago area 100 years old, was renovated in 2009 and then partially remodeled kitchen / living room in 2015. There is a crawl space that is dirt that we are encapsulating to get rid of a musty smell / improve air quality. There was known water / mold in two window sills that we remediated and we sealed up the windows (new ones coming in a month or so). Finally, there are three fire places linked up to a brick chimney stack which didn’t have caps / the chimney wasn’t sealed— we fixed and water proofed, fixed cracks up top and added caps to each. 

The floors were redone / varnished with duraseal 123 coffee stain but I’m not sure whether they were sealed properly. I read online that this particular stain can be used to finish floors / not necessary to use poly or wax with them. We felt with moisture on multiple fronts and I’ve read online some people describe mold as having a woody smell, but it’s very much more shop/ saw dust like vs a moisture smell at this point. Would the partially finished floors be causing a saw dust smell or is that not usually an issue? Wondering if we use water poly to seal them it will fix the issue.

My main wishes for a new grinder is to decrease steps in my flow and improve flavor and consistency. Minimal noise is also a big consideration as we are moving to an older apartment and don't want to wake our neighbors when I make a 5 am coffee.

I must admit that I have caught the flu called ""analysis paralysis"" and feel stuck in my decision making.
I have read that there are issues with the Libra and a 54 mm portafilter as well as with the ""FH error"", but there is also a big price difference between the Libra and Atom.

Therefore I am looking for people with experience with either/both grinders and preferably together with a 54 mm portafilter. Do you think that the Atom w65 is worth the splurge? Or will the Libra be the right choice for a beginner looking to improve their setup?

I'm quitting only because it's my last stop at trying to fix insomnia. My insomnia is really vicious and I can only sleep for 3 hours at a time before I wake up. Totalling about 5-6 hours per night of fragmented sleep and it's been like this for about a decade.

About a few months after I started drinking coffee, I developed IBS-C and could only (maybe) have a bowel movement if I had coffee first. This is manageable today even when I drink coffee, and even helps with bowel movements. I've been drinking on average 4 cups of decently strong coffee per day.

Quitting coffee (or at least try to) as a last ditch effort to fix my insomnia has been one of the most difficult decisions I've ever had to make.

Now roughly 7 days in, none of my sleeping issues have resolved, nothing has improved whatsoever. I'm only feeling the devastating fatigue that I would otherwise always feel because of my poor sleep.

Obviously I can't work for shit, go on my daily walks, get my ass to the gym, practice guitar, or anything useful that my caffeinated self would happily do.

I'm frantic about how long it will take for me to know for sure whether coffee was the root cause of my sleeping issues. I don't want to wait a day longer than necessary to establish this fact so I can get back onto drinking the most precious of beverages that makes life worth living.

At this point I am feeling oh so keen to get back onto coffee once I realize this wasn't the root problem.

I hear people say it gets better but at this point I don't even know if I want it to get better. It's as if I'm just as content sleeping like shit and strip a good 10 years off my life expectancy because of it, rather than quitting coffee and maybe feel ok after 6 months.

As you probably hear from my words, I sound pretty damn depressed. It's because I am. I can't get through a workday without feeling like I just want to be left alone and sleep til the end of times.

I am truly, deeply addicted to this crap and if I don't get a good nights sleep soon I don't think this experiment of quitting coffee will work.",2,1732021373.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

Ordered a Philos, which arrived super quickly but a bit bent out of shape on arrival. Slight tilt off vertical and the base warped a bit. The thing is built like a tank, so I’m not sure how it happened - either it left the factory with damage, or it must have taken a massive beating during shipping (but the packaging looked ok). It’s built too sturdy to “pop it back” as well.

I’ve been trying to get hold of mazzer but they’re unresponsive to emails and I can’t find a phone line. Anyone have a number/contact that works?

Here’s a pic of the warp. I only realised once I’d set it up and was like “wait, shouldn’t this be vertical? “ 😂

\- Sunshine and/or bright light in the morning 

\- I have two cups of coffee a day, 1 before my early morning workout which is usually around 530/6am and another before I start my workday around 9am. No caffeine after 10am

\- Stop eating 2 hours before bed 

\- Dim the lights and put on blue light blocking glasses about an hour before bed 

\- Keep the room temperature cool 

\- Get Plenty of exercise during the day and take 1-2 walks (I have a dog so this helps) to get light mid day 

\- Consistent sleep schedule, I am in bed by 9:30 every night yet don't fall asleep for an hour most nights

\- I stick to mainly whole food diet, staying hydrated as well 

\- I do not smoke or smoke weed and if I do drink, it is only occasionally. I know I can expect worse sleep and that is a consequence I am willing to pay every once in a while, maybe twice a month. 

I hate to rely on supplements but I feel like it might be the only option I have left. 

I do not take melatonin and do not want to, I’ve done my own research on it and personally would prefer to stay away.

 I have dabbled with other supplements such as magnesium, magnesium theonate, “Calm” Magnesium powder, apigenin. Haven’t tried with L-theanin but I have heard it is something to consider. I did not see any noticeable difference with any of these, but it could’ve been a low quality version. If there are other brands people would recommend or have had good experiences with I would be willing to try, please include when and how you take it and what has worked best for you. Any other supplements ideas would be appreciated. 

I feel like I have the lifestyle aspect down but if there is anything else to add or remove feel free to leave any thoughts below. For context I am a 25 year old male. The reason I post here is because my sleep score is consistently around 50-60 in garmin, about 6-6.5 hours- 1 hour deep, 5 light, 20min rem (roughly). which always gives me a training rediness of 1 lol although for better or for worse that has not stopped me.

I noticed the same tactics at my friend's shop. I imagine if I feel the way I do about feeling obligated to pay tips, that other consumers also may feel this way and this might be reasons why Starbucks, his coffee shops, and others are suffering to have repeat business. I thought about bringing it up to him that he should  take tips off his payment app and also advertise that ""no tips"" required or needed and market that ""we get it!"".

Tried both WDT and 'blind shaking' puck prep. 

Sour shot still. Preheated everything in the picopresso in a bowl of boiling hot water (including inside the chamber). 

I started at 17.5g in, 36g out. 10s preinfuse, no puck screen, double preheat of chamber. Changing 1, at most 2 variables at a time until I got down to the recipe I currently have. (About 30/40 espressos in the last week) What am I doing wrong? There must be something I've completely went over? 

I have got great espresso out of this thing before(with different beans (only preinfusing for 10s or so with basic prep) I don't want to blame the beans as ""there's no such thing as sour beans"" and its not exactly a light roast so I shouldn't be having too many problems. If I grind any finer I think it would choke the machine (it already basically is, slowly pressing once every 4 seconds during shot)

I feel like the over-extracted monster of a recipe I'm at now should be giving me horrible bitterness, but it's still sour and acidic with only a tiny tiny bit of sweetness. 

The only variable left is the ambient temperature/humidity, as we don't have the heating on in the kitchen. But this seems way too excessive measure for getting a medium roast to 'not sour' level?

I have got 2 more bean roasts arriving so will hopefully be able to 100% rule out the 'beans' as the problem.

Throwaway as I have RL friends active here. Noticed a changed of behavior from my wife starting around last May. It coincided with her co-worker losing his wife to cancer. There was a work achievement celebration thing following the end of fiscal year. She was supposed to be home around 10 pm but she stayed til 1 am. I trust her so I just brush it off. She even apologized in the morning and told me she and a co-worker stayed  in the bar a couple of hours after. Apparently he was just venting about how difficult it was being a single dad, depressed, missing his wife, kid asking where mommy, yaddy yadda. 

I thought it was nice of her to be emphatic. But then the frequent phone calls, text messages soon started to flood her phone. Tried to establish boundaries, saying if the guy needs support/ advice, don't it during our chill time at home. Then the phone calls and texts suddenly stopped. I ask her how's he doing, and she said he is coping fine. Never heard his name again.

However, she started coming home late, constantly having errands after work, not home to cook or eat what I prepared. We started eating mostly deliveries. We'll reddit has taught me that these are signs of something not good. We don't have open phone policy but I knew her and that she is lazy in making pins. I know here bank pin number as it was her home town zip code. Tried it and it worked. 

Well the messages started innocently,    asking advice, help w/ grief, which I get as my wife's mom died of cancer before we even met. Then it evolved into coordinating their breaks at work, getting coffee after work (she's not even a coffee person) then it culminated with my wife meeting his daughter at the daycare ( weird  I know but my wife loves kids, she adores her nieces and nephews, we are trying ourselves). Nothing sexual in the messages but there were a lot of phone calls. Only message that caught my attention was them taking a sick day together.

I was not aware of this. My wife never calls in sick without me knowing. And if she does take a sick day, it is usually a Friday. With this information, I plan to contact a PI but then, my neighbor who is into EVs out of the blue told me ""you finally give in and got an EV eh? I said nope, no new car here. He said then who's car was it I saw last Wednesday on your driveway?
It is apparently a small blue SUV VW EV.  I knew right there and then that they crossed the line.

But instead of hiring a PI, I installed  hidden cameras in our house, in the living room, in the bedroom and office.  I did not confront her, acted  as normal as possible.  In the next 2 weeks, she never initiated sex which is unusual as we are trying to have a baby. 

When I reviewed the 2 weeks cameras' worth of recording, my heart sunk. They fuck like bunnies in every corner of our fuckin house. This woman that I love, gentle quiet, slow to anger was like a cat in heat, she is the aggressive one. My heart was about to explode, I can feel it through my throat. 

But something changed after watching every second of it. I felt alive. I don't know but I wanted more. 
I recorded them for 2 months, they've done it 1-2 times a week. And then it stopped. 

I knew they're still doing it but not in our house anymore. So I gathered all the evidence, found a divorce lawyer and ask for advice. Her advice was to open new account separate my pay checks and leave the investments atm. She was about to start D draft agreement. But I stopped her with the pretense of maybe we could work it out. 

Well last Saturday, I confronted my wife. She was surprised but was not remorseful. They're apparently in love. They're soulmates. Fated to be together. (Felt the ick thinking fate has his wife die of cancer for them to be together? Fuck them). She wants to give me a favorable and quick divorce. 

But I said no. I told her I want us to stay and live together but she can continue to fuck him as long as I can record them. He called me a sicko but at least I'm not a cheater. She made me who I am. 

She was about to call her AP but I stopped her. I told her she can continue with the affair but AP must not be aware that I know and to keep  the recording hidden. She said or what? Or I would expose their affair to their HR, her family and friends. 

I felt the pain on her face upon hearing my theats. AP needs money as he is in shitload of debts from his wife's treatment. They can't afford to be jobless in this economy and they have good jobs. She agreed.  But I feel like she is planning something to get out of this situation.

Last Sunday I demanded and got a new recording. How long will this last? I don't know but I'm enjoying it. I maybe the AH but this is my way of avenging the death of our marriage. Don't tell me about therapy, I will get one once this is over.",0,1732020661.0,AITAH,61,0.44,False

You ever been on one of those underways where it felt like the boat was trying to kill you? Drills stacked on drills, systems failing faster than you could fix them, and the COB stomping around bitching about terroristic dirt. Morale? Lower than a whale’s nutsack. Fresh out of refit, we were barely holding it together. And that’s when two well-meaning but green sailors—nubs, as we call them, decided to liven things up.

For the uninitiated, a nub is a sailor who hasn’t earned their dolphins yet. They’re trained, sharp, and eager to prove themselves, but they lack real operational experience, which often leads to moments like this one.

It all started in the torpedo room. The AEF, short for Auxiliary Electrician Forward, was one of those nubs still figuring out how to balance enthusiasm with competence. His job was keeping the forward compartments powered and running, critical, but not exactly glamorous. 

Then there was the LL Watch, short for Lower Level Watch, who spent his time babysitting systems deep in the boat’s guts. His job? Make sure nothing broke, caught fire, or exploded. It was the kind of job that gave him plenty of time to fuck around and find out.

Two nubs, barely out of their final checkouts and practically on their first big-boy watch, decided they had something to prove. They were unsupervised, unafraid, and most importantly, unaware of how badly this was about to go.

“One! One! One! One!”

That was the LL Watch, his voice carrying all the way down to my rack in 21-man like a bad sonar echo. I rolled out of my coffin, annoyed as hell. I figured I’d head down and tell them to shut the fuck up before the COB showed up.

By the time I made it to the torpedo room, I paused just outside the p way. I didn’t want to storm in blind, so I leaned against the frame and observed. The scene was already a train wreck.

The AEF, red-faced and committed, was trying to crank out push-ups on the torpedo room deck. He wasn’t doing great. 

“One! One! One! One!” the LL Watch kept shouting, doubling as both coach and troll.

“What the fuck are you even doing?” one of the SEALs asked, arms crossed as he leaned against the upper torpedo rack, watching the chaos unfold like a bad reality show.

“I’m counting!” the LL Watch snapped back, like that was obvious.

“No, you’re just saying ‘one,’” the SEAL shot back, smirking.

The AEF wheezed out, “See, fucker, I’m going all the way down,” adjusting his poopie suit for what he thought would be a solid redemption arc. Spoiler: it wasn’t.

Then the LL Watch had a brilliant idea. “Use the cup! If the cup hits your chest, then you’ll know you went down far enough!”

Now, this wasn’t just any cup. This was a boat mug. Thick as a the hull, stained with coffee, chow juice, and 10-15 years of questionable fluids. It was the kind of mug that would survive a meltdown.

The LL Watch slid the mug under the AEF’s chest like he was setting up a science experiment. “Can’t fuck it up now, shitbag!”

The AEF dropped down again, dog tags clicking. His chest barely tapped the cup with a faint clink, and the LL Watch lost it.

“One! One! One! One!” he shouted, laughing so hard he had to lean against the bulkhead.

The AEF froze, embarrassment flashing across his face before he lunged, arms wide. But the LL Watch was ready, sliding out of the way like it was choreographed. In one motion, he snatched the cup off the deck and threw a goddamn haymaker, smashing it straight into the AEF's face hole.

CRACK.

The sound was brutal. Blood sprayed as the mug connected with the AEF’s face, sending him staggering back. His teeth jutted out at odd angles, like a broken picket fence, and blood dripped from his mouth onto the deck. I still remember the scream he let out after contact. It was loud enough to wake the dead, or at least the COB.

The SEALs quickly reacted, like they’d been expecting it. Laughing their asses off, they separated the LL Watch from the dazed AEF, pulling them apart quick, fast, and in a hurry. One SEAL followed the AEF, who was staggering toward the head, blood dripping from his face, leaving dime sized red drops marking his path. 

Just as the chaos reached its peak the COB stormed in, his boots pounding the deck like a hammer to an anvil.. 

“WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?” he bellowed, stomping into the torpedo room like the wrath of Neptune himself. “WHO DID THIS? I WILL SKULL-FUCK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU IDIOTS!”

The room went dead silent. Even the SEALs straightened up, though I swear one of them had to bite his lip to keep from laughing.

In the end, the LL Watch got patched up, the AEF got an ass-chewing that probably still haunts him, and the SEALs walked away with a whammy of sea story they’ll probably tell at every bar from here to eternity.

As for me? I shook my head and headed back to 21-man, laughing so hard I almost pissed myself. Some underways you forget. Others, like this one, stick with you forever and never let you forget the importance of dental.

Fresh out of refit, we were barely holding it together. And that’s when two well-meaning but green sailors—nubs, as we call them, decided to liven things up.

For the uninitiated, a nub is a sailor who hasn’t earned their dolphins yet. They’re trained, sharp, and eager to prove themselves, but they lack real operational experience, which often leads to moments like this one.

It all started in the torpedo room. The AEF, short for Auxiliary Electrician Forward, was one of those nubs still figuring out how to balance enthusiasm with competence. His job was keeping the forward compartments powered and running, critical, but not exactly glamorous. 

Then there was the LL Watch, short for Lower Level Watch, who spent his time babysitting systems deep in the boat’s guts. His job? Make sure nothing broke, caught fire, or exploded. It was the kind of job that gave him plenty of time to fuck around and find out.

Two nubs, barely out of their final checkouts and practically on their first big-boy watch, decided they had something to prove. They were unsupervised, unafraid, and most importantly, unaware of how badly this was about to go.

“One! One! One! One!”

That was the LL Watch, his voice carrying all the way down to my rack in 21-man like a bad sonar echo. I rolled out of my coffin, annoyed as hell. I figured I’d head down and tell them to shut the fuck up before the COB showed up.

By the time I made it to the torpedo room, I paused just outside the p way. I didn’t want to storm in blind, so I leaned against the frame and observed. The scene was already a train wreck.

The AEF, red-faced and committed, was trying to crank out push-ups on the torpedo room deck. He wasn’t doing great. 

“One! One! One! One!” the LL Watch kept shouting, doubling as both coach and troll.

“What the fuck are you even doing?” one of the SEALs asked, arms crossed as he leaned against the upper torpedo rack, watching the chaos unfold like a bad reality show.

“I’m counting!” the LL Watch snapped back, like that was obvious.

“No, you’re just saying ‘one,’” the SEAL shot back, smirking.

The AEF wheezed out, “See, fucker, I’m going all the way down,” adjusting his poopie suit for what he thought would be a solid redemption arc. Spoiler: it wasn’t.

Then the LL Watch had a brilliant idea. “Use the cup! If the cup hits your chest, then you’ll know you went down far enough!”

Now, this wasn’t just any cup. This was a boat mug. Thick as a the hull, stained with coffee, chow juice, and 10-15 years of questionable fluids. It was the kind of mug that would survive a meltdown.

The LL Watch slid the mug under the AEF’s chest like he was setting up a science experiment. “Can’t fuck it up now, shitbag!”

The AEF dropped down again, dog tags clicking. His chest barely tapped the cup with a faint clink, and the LL Watch lost it.

“One! One! One! One!” he shouted, laughing so hard he had to lean against the bulkhead.

The AEF froze, embarrassment flashing across his face before he lunged, arms wide. But the LL Watch was ready, sliding out of the way like it was choreographed. In one motion, he snatched the cup off the deck and threw a goddamn haymaker, smashing it straight into the AEF's face hole.

CRACK.

The sound was brutal. Blood sprayed as the mug connected with the AEF’s face, sending him staggering back. His teeth jutted out at odd angles, like a broken picket fence, and blood dripped from his mouth onto the deck. I still remember the scream he let out after contact. It was loud enough to wake the dead, or at least the COB.

The SEALs quickly reacted, like they’d been expecting it. Laughing their asses off, they separated the LL Watch from the dazed AEF, pulling them apart quick, fast, and in a hurry. One SEAL followed the AEF, who was staggering toward the head, blood dripping from his face, leaving dime sized red drops marking his path. 

Just as the chaos reached its peak the COB stormed in, his boots pounding the deck like a hammer to an anvil.. 

“WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?” he bellowed, stomping into the torpedo room like the wrath of Neptune himself. “WHO DID THIS? I WILL SKULL-FUCK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU IDIOTS!”

The room went dead silent. Even the SEALs straightened up, though I swear one of them had to bite his lip to keep from laughing.

In the end, the LL Watch got patched up, the AEF got an ass-chewing that probably still haunts him, and the SEALs walked away with a whammy of sea story they’ll probably tell at every bar from here to eternity.

As for me? I shook my head and headed back to 21-man, laughing so hard I almost pissed myself. Some underways you forget. Others, like this one, stick with you forever and never let you forget the importance of dental.

Background lang po about me. I did some horrible things when I was young.

Recently got into an argument with my partner because I caught him posting sa hookups sub looking for kausap and coffee date. I confronted him and nagtalo kamo. I think naman I didn’t say something offensive to him. He brought up my past mistakes saying na mas malala pa daw nagawa ko. He said na nanglalalaki daw ako (when we were starting kasi di ko sure if seryoso ba talaga yung samin), nagbenta ng nudes (I did for extra income kasi may kid), naminanipulate ko sya to thinking that sya ang tatay ng anak namin, and may scandal daw ako sa internet (dahil nga nagbenta ako ng nudes, ayun may nagreupload). Somehow true naman yun. But when he found out (years ago pa), di ko na ginawa yun. Sya naman, continue sa ginagawa nyang makipagdate at makipagchat sa iba. Ang reason nya eh, wala daw ako right maglecture sa kanya coz mas malala nga nagawa ko and not because I stopped from doing those, eh pwede ko na syang manduhan na magstop na din.

Okay lang naman if di kami magkaayos. I just feel bad about myself. Feeling ko kasi nagmature na ako kahit papano and nag-improve to be a better person. I have 2 works and can provide for my family. Bahay na nga lang ako because subsob sa work. Thinking about the things he said, feeling ko my kid will never be proud of me as a mom. And forever na ako nakakulong sa past ko.

# Scene 1: Arkham Asylum - 1994

The film opens in the grim confines of Arkham Asylum. *Ne me quitte pas by Jacques Brel* plays softly in the background as Arthur Hillson, once known as the infamous Joker, slowly wakes up from heavy sedation. His eyes flutter open, disoriented, and his lips begin to move as he mumbles softly, repeating a phrase.

**Arthur (mumbling):** ""Folie à deux... folie à deux...""

A nurse enters the room, looking at him with a mix of pity and indifference.

He tried to sit up, his body shaky from the drugs still in his system. The nurse said, ""You've been in the ICU for ten days. You're lucky to be alive.""

Arthur lies there, looking dazed and confused.

**Nurse:** ""You were found naked, covered in feces, face down in vomit, with a bedsheet tied around your neck. We honestly thought you were a goner.""

The nurse whispered, ""Between you and me, Arthur, not everyone wanted to see you survive. You should've seen the disappointment on their faces when you pulled through.""

Arthur laughs nervously, but pain shoots through his stomach, making him look down at the white bandage wrapped around it, a result of the operation after his overdose. (He had noticed the code to the medicine cabinet scribbled on a piece of paper during a routine medical examination, which led him to steal and consume a mixture of pills.) Then he closes his eyes, and turns onto his side. 

The nurse changes his saline bag for his IV and leaves the room. His eyes open and he stares at his reflection in the cracked mirror, his hollow eyes empty yet glinting with a strange sense of amusement. Arthur smiles faintly, and slowly a dark, twisted laugh begins—a laugh that grows louder, echoing through the cold, narrow corridor of Arkham.

His laughter reverberates with the madness that has defined his life, and the phrase he murmured—""folie à deux""—hangs in the air, hinting at a shared madness that connects Arthur to his followers.

# Scene 2: Arthur's Past - The Seeds of Madness

Flashback to 1973, when Arthur was just 10 years old. The young Arthur Hillson lies in his small Batmobile bed, staring at the ceiling. Nights In White Satin by The Moody Blues plays quietly in the background. He thinks about his father, Thomas Hillson, a Wall Street trader. One night, Thomas was in a hurry to get home, excited after learning he had made a fortune on the stock market. He never made it—his car veered off the road, and he disappeared into the Hudson River. Thomas had dropped a lit cigar, causing him to lose control of the vehicle.

Penny, Arthur's mother, was left alone, consumed by grief and confusion. Penny and Thomas had moved to New York from California in 1964 when Arthur was a baby.  After Thomas's disappearance, she convinced herself that Thomas had abandoned her and 7 year old Arthur, returning to California without them. To protect Arthur from the harsh reality, she lied, telling him that his father was the mayor of New York—a powerful and important figure.

About a year after Thomas's disappearance, the banks seized his estate, leaving Penny and Arthur with nothing. Penny struggled, and soon she became homeless. Unable to provide for her son, she was eventually forced to give Arthur up for adoption. Before Tommy Heys was mayor of New York, he and his wife adopted Arthur, believing they couldn't have children. However, shortly after, she became pregnant with Bruce. Arthur spent a year in the care system, shuffled between homes, feeling abandoned and alone.

Penny worked tirelessly to get back on her feet. She found a low paying job at a massage parlour and saved enough to rent a small apartment on Hilltop Crescent NY. She kept her empty Moët et Chandon bottle in her cabinet, which only served as a reminder of the luxury she had lost. At the parlour, she met her boyfriend, whom Arthur always disliked. Arthur would often say, ""You're not my dad,"" whenever they clashed. Despite her struggles, Penny managed to rebuild her life and bring Arthur back. But the experience left deep scars on both of them—Arthur had lost the stability of his former home, and Penny’s pride had been shattered.

When she finally got Arthur back, she tried to resume a normal life, but the damage had been done. Penny became overprotective and controlling, her bitterness towards life affecting her relationship with Arthur. The once-bright dreams of a happy family had withered, replaced with resentment and struggle.

**Penny:** ""Your father was someone special, Arthur. The mayor of New York. He had to leave because he had responsibilities—a bigger purpose.""

In Arthur's young, impressionable mind, his father became like Thomas Wayne—a wealthy, respected protector of the city. He imagined New York as a place like Gotham, filled with heroes and villains. Lying in his Batmobile bed, Arthur fantasized that he, too, could become a hero—someone his father would be proud of. But Penny’s health soon began to decline, and those dreams began to twist and darken.

Diagnosed with a degenerative disease, Penny turned to alcohol to cope, her once-loving demeanor giving way to bitterness and anger. The vibrant mother Arthur once knew became a shadow of herself, and her love for humor and joy faded along with her health.

**Penny (bitterly):** ""Arthur, jokes don’t put food on the table. You need to grow up. Dreams are for people who can afford to fail.""

**Arthur (whispering to his reflection):** ""Why did the chicken cross the road...? To get away from here.""

Arthur, now a young teen, tried to hold on to his dreams of becoming a comedian, practicing jokes in front of the mirror, hoping to make his mother laugh again. *Yesterday* by The Beatles plays quietly as Arthur struggles to find humor in his difficult life. But her scorn and growing indifference crushed his spirit, pushing him further into isolation. Arthur began to create a fantasy world, where he was beloved and respected—a stark contrast to his grim reality.

# Scene 3: False Accusations and Police Harassment

By the time Arthur was 19, he found himself at the center of a local controversy. One night, Arthur saw a school on fire from a distance and called the fire department, trying to do the right thing.

Despite his efforts, the police had the actual culprit who lit the fire, but let him go when they saw Arthur appear at the scene, choosing instead to point fingers at him.

Suddenly, police officers approach him—Officer Greg Waldron leading the charge, a man who had tormented Arthur since childhood.

**Officer Waldron (smirking):** ""Well, well, if it isn't Hillson. Fancy seeing you here.""

**Arthur:** ""I... I called it in. I was trying to help.""

**Officer Waldron:** ""Sure you were. Funny how you're always around when trouble starts.""

He was an easy scapegoat—a socially awkward young man from a broken household. *Paint It Black* by The Rolling Stones plays in the background, emphasizing the bleakness of Arthur's situation.

The false accusations marked the beginning of Arthur’s troubled relationship with the Gotham Police Department. Officers began harassing him regularly, showing up at all hours, questioning him about various crimes, and mocking his aspirations of being a comedian.

**Officer 2 (mocking):** ""You, a comedian? The only joke around here is your miserable life, Hillson.""

The harassment deeply affected Arthur, isolating him even further. His few neighbors who once spoke to him began to avoid him. Arthur became entirely withdrawn, focusing only on caring for his ailing mother, who continued her downward spiral.

# Scene 4: Penny’s Decline and Arthur’s Breaking Point

Penny’s health continued to decline, and she eventually became bedridden. Arthur did his best to care for her, feeding her and managing her medication. Sometimes, Penny showed glimpses of the mother she once was.

**Penny (softly):** ""Arthur, you deserved so much more. I wish things had been different.""

But those moments of tenderness were rare. More often, Penny lashed out at Arthur, her frustration over her condition manifesting as bitterness. One night, overwhelmed by exhaustion and hopelessness, Arthur experienced a delusion. He imagined himself placing a pillow over Penny's face, ending her suffering and his own. In his mind, she smiled at him, whispering her thanks before slipping away.

Arthur snapped out of it, horrified by his thoughts. He realized he was still sitting beside her, the pillow untouched. Shortly after, Penny passed away. Arthur came home one day to find her lifeless, her face finally free of pain.

Arthur stood in the doorway, numb. The grief hit him like a wave—not just for her death but for the years of suffering, the love that had turned into resentment, and the dreams that had twisted into nightmares. Arthur was now utterly alone, spending his days watching old comedy specials, with Penny’s empty chair beside him.

# Scene 5: Penny's Grave

Arthur visits his mother's grave on a gloomy, overcast day. The cemetery is filled with rows of gravestones. Arthur walks to Penny's plot, where instead of a proper headstone, her grave is marked by a small wooden stake with her name crudely etched onto it. It looks forgotten, out of place among the others.

Arthur kneels, staring at the marker, his eyes welling with tears. He touches her name, his lips curling into a bitter smile.

**Arthur (whispering):** ""No headstone for you, Mom. Just a piece of wood. I guess they figured you weren't worth it... Just like me.""

He places a wilted flower by the wooden stake. His laughter starts soft, but it grows louder—tinged with grief, anger, and hopelessness.

**Act 2: Escape from Arkham and Gotham’s Underworld**

# Scene 6: The Hurricane and the Escape

It is now 1994, and Gotham City is being hit by a fierce hurricane. *Riders on the Storm* by The Doors plays as Arkham Asylum shakes under the force of the storm. The power fails, and parts of the building collapse, allowing inmates to escape. Arthur, among them, steps into the stormy night, convinced this is his chance at freedom—believing his followers have come to liberate him. **Arthur (thinking):** ""They came for me. This is my moment.""

Arthur walks through the shattered halls of Arkham, his laughter echoing amidst the chaos as he disappears into the darkness.

# Scene 7: Returning to Crime - Meeting Eddie

Arthur finds himself in the Gotham underworld, reconnecting with an old acquaintance, Eddie, a small-time gang leader whom he met the night of the school fire at 'Hehe's' comedy club house. Eddie and his gang are wary of Arthur, but they are intrigued by his reputation and erratic energy. They see potential in his unpredictability, despite their wariness.

**Eddie:** ""Arthur, didn’t think we'd see you again. Thought Arkham had swallowed you for good.""

**Arthur (grinning):** ""Arkham tried, but it couldn't handle the punchline.""

Arthur becomes involved in the gang's operations, indulging in drugs and violence. At first, Arthur hesitates, unsure if he wants to go down this path, but the thought of belonging somewhere and escaping his grim reality outweighs his doubts. *Gimme Shelter* by The Rolling Stones plays as Arthur descends deeper into the criminal world. One night, Eddie offers Arthur a line of cocaine.

**Eddie (smirking):** ""This stuff will knock your clock off, Arthur. Trust me, it's just what you need.""

Arthur hesitates, then snorts the cocaine. His pupils dilate, and his grin widens as the rush hits him.

**Arthur (laughing maniacally):** ""Feels like I’m finally in on the joke.""

The cocaine fuels Arthur’s delusions, and he feels invincible.

# Scene 8: Planning the Heist

*Sympathy for the Devil* by The Rolling Stones plays as the gang parties and decides to pull off an ambitious heist—stealing gold bars from one of Gotham’s most secure banks. Eddie and Arthur play chess while discussing the details of the robbery, wired on cocaine, strategizing every move like pieces on the board.

**Arthur (casually moving a bishop):** ""You know, Eddie, planning this heist is a lot like this game. Every piece has its purpose, every move has consequences.""

**Eddie (studying the board):** ""True, but unlike chess, we don't get to see all of our opponent's moves.""

**Arthur (smirking):** ""That's where intuition comes in. We anticipate, adapt. The police think they're the kings of the board, but we'll show them otherwise.""

**Eddie (pausing before moving a knight):** ""So, your idea to jam the police station doors and chain the compound gates—that's your opening gambit?""

**Arthur (nodding confidently):** ""Precisely. It buys us the time we need. While they're fumbling to get out, we'll be making our escape.""

**Eddie (raising an eyebrow):** ""Bold move. But if they catch on too quickly, we could be cornered.""

**Arthur (leaning back):** ""Every plan has its risks. But fortune favors the bold, right?""

*Several gang members drift closer, intrigued by the conversation.*

**Gang Member 1:** ""What's all this about chaining up the cops?""

**Arthur (addressing the group):** ""We'll split into two teams. One team hits the bank; the other secures the police station. Synchronize watches, stick to the schedule, and we’ll be ghosts before they even know what happened.""

**Gang Member 2**: ""And if something goes sideways?""

**Arthur (meeting his gaze):** ""We have contingency plans. Routes mapped out, safe houses ready. But stick to the plan, and it won't come to that.""

**Eddie (after a moment of contemplation):** ""You've thought of everything, haven't you?""

**Arthur (smiling):** ""I prefer to leave nothing to chance.""

*The gang exchanges nods, a sense of excitement building.*

**Gang Member 3**: ""Alright, we're in. Let's make history.""

**Arthur (raising his glass):** ""To us—the ones rewriting the rules.""

The gang, inspired by Arthur's audacity, agrees to the plan. They prepare for the heist, with Arthur leading the way.

# Scene 9: The Diversion

Late at night, team 2 sneaks to the main police compound. They carry heavy chains and locks, working quickly to chain the gates shut. Inside the station, officers are oblivious, engrossed in their late-night routines—paperwork, coffee, and idle chatter.

Gang Member 4, tightening the last chain, smiles as he looks at the sealed gate.

**Gang Member 4 (radios through):** ""All good to go!""

**Arthur (whispering to himself):** ""Who's laughing now?""

# Scene 10: The Heist

Team 1 hits the bank, masked and armed. They storm inside, overpowering the guards and quickly reaching the vault. The gold bars are loaded into an armored truck as Arthur keeps watch, his manic grin never fading.

**Eddie:** ""Let’s go, Arthur! We’ve got to move!""

Arthur lingers, holding a gold bar, admiring its shine.

**Arthur (to himself):** ""All that glitters… It’s mine now.""

He tosses the gold bar into the truck and jumps into the driver’s seat. The gang makes their escape, speeding into the dark streets of Gotham. Eddie and the gang escape in a separate van as planned, heading to the abandoned warehouse where they had originally planned the robbery. The warehouse is the combination of a chop shop and a man cave, filled with stolen classic cars, including a black 1955 Ford Lincoln Futura, along with a pool table, couches, tables, and chairs.

**Act 3: The Chase and Arthur's End**

# Scene 11: The Getaway and Bruce’s Pursuit

As the gang speeds away from the bank, things quickly go wrong. The police manage to break free from the compound sooner than expected—a vigilant officer notices the chained gates and raises the alarm. The police already equipped with large bolt croppers, laugh as they cut away the chains. Sirens blare across the city as patrol cars flood the streets.

Among them is Bruce, an ex-cop whose father—the former mayor—was killed by one of Arthur’s supporters in the early 80's. Bruce, driven by vengeance, is relentless in his pursuit of Arthur.

Arthur drives the armored truck with a twisted grin, swerving through Gotham’s streets, the weight of the gold making the truck lurch from side to side.

**Arthur (yelling to himself):** ""Catch me if you can, Brucey boy!""

# Scene 12: The High-Speed Chase

The police, led by Bruce, chase Arthur through the dark streets of Gotham. The rain pours down, making the roads slick and dangerous. Arthur drives recklessly, the truck skidding and swerving wildly. Bruce, in close pursuit, radios for more units, determined to put an end to Arthur’s madness.

# Scene 13: The Crash at the Bridge

The chase leads them to an old, crumbling bridge on the outskirts of the city. Arthur, pushing the truck beyond its limits, loses control. The vehicle swerves violently, flips onto its side, and skids across the bridge before coming to a stop, upside down.

Gold bars spill out of the truck, scattering across the wet surface of the bridge. Arthur, dazed but alive, crawls out of the wreckage. He sees the gold and begins to stuff the bars into his clothes—his jacket, his pants, and his sleeves.

**Arthur (gasping, laughing):** ""All mine... It’s all mine...""

# Scene 14: Crossing the River

Hearing the approaching sirens, Arthur stumbles to the edge of the bridge, where a dark, fast-flowing river rushes below. Desperate to escape, Arthur climbs over the side of the bridge and carefully makes his way down a steep embankment to reach the riverbank. Once there, he wades into the water, the weight of the gold making each step a struggle.

He laughs as he tries to cross, muttering to himself.

**Arthur (mumbling):** ""I’m rich... richer than all of them...""

But the deeper he goes, the more the weight pulls him under. The water reaches his chest, and the gold begins to drag him down. Arthur fights to keep his head above water, but it’s no use. He slips into a deeper part of the river, panic flashing across his face as he struggles for breath.

# Scene 15: The Final Confrontation

Bruce arrives just in time to see Arthur struggling in the river. He runs to the riverbank, watching as Arthur attempts to crawl out, weighed down by the gold. Arthur, gasping for air, manages to reach a shallower area.

Bruce steps into the water, approaching Arthur. He looks down at the man who has caused him so much suffering.

**Arthur (weakly, grinning):** ""Well, Brucey... here we are again.""

Bruce, his face hardened, presses his boot onto Arthur’s head, shoving him back underwater.

**Bruce (coldly):** ""This ends now.""

Arthur’s hands flail for a moment, his laughter bubbling up and fading as the river swallows him whole. The water calms, leaving only ripples behind.

# Scene 16: The Division of the Spoils

With Arthur presumed dead, Bruce and the remaining corrupt cops secure the gold. They divide $200 million worth of gold among themselves, planning their escape from Gotham.

**Corrupt Cop:** ""We need to lay low until the heat dies down.""

**Bruce:** ""Stick to the plan. We disappear, and no one traces this back to us.""

They drive off into the night, each heading in different directions.

Epilogue: The Morgue

The scene transitions to New York State Hospital. The hospital’s morgue is cold and sterile, fluorescent lights flickering overhead. Arthur’s lifeless body is wheeled into the morgue, a white sheet covering his face. The attendant pulls back the sheet, revealing Arthur's still, pale face, his expression frozen somewhere between agony and laughter.

The attendant takes notes and tags Arthur’s toe with his name—Arthur Hillson—before closing the drawer. The sound of the metal door sliding shut echoes through the silent morgue.

Closing Montage

Scenes of Gotham flash by:

* Graffiti of the Joker’s face appears on brick walls, with the words ""The Joke’s Not Over"" written beneath.
* A group of youths don clown masks, raising their fists in defiance.
* In a dimly lit room, a radio crackles to life. A distorted, chilling laugh echoes, unmistakably Arthur's.

The camera pans over Gotham as dawn breaks, the sky painted in a dim, gray haze.

Sooo I’m Dutch and ever since got into other languages I also became more aware about my own lmao. Here are some thing I noticed:(nobody asked, sry. Might be fun if you want to learn Dutch though)

We can make words as long as we want. You just stick them together (I know this is not unique to this language but I still think it’s cool): ‘Meervoudigepersoonlijkheidsstoornis’ (multiple personality disorder) or ‘Arbeidsongeschiktheidsverzekeringsmaatschappij’ (disability insurance company) 

We also have a quite literal vocabulary. Just a few examples of their translations :

Pubes = Shame hair (schaamhaar)

Fridge = Cool closet (koelkast)

Gloves = Hand shoes (handschoenen)

Ladybug  =  Dear lord’s tiny beast (lieveheersbeestje)

Slug = Nude snail (naaktslak)

Parents =  Olders (aardappel)

Vacuum = Dustsucker (stofzuiger)

Garden hose = Garden snake (tuinslang)

Mayor = Citizen master (burgemeester)

Reindeer - Run animal (rendier)

Cotton candy = Sugar spin (suikerspin)

Sandwich = Buttered ham (boterham)

Goosebumps - Chickenskin (kippenvel)

Hospital = Sick house (ziekenhuis)

Bouncer = Outthrower (uitsmijter)

Fart = Little wind (scheetje)

Highway = Fast road (snelweg)

Potatoe = Ground appel (aardappel)

Victim = Slaughter sacrifice (slachtoffer)

Enjoyed = Nutted (genoten)

Binoculars = Farawaylooker (verrekijker)

The fire brigade - The burnagain (brandweer)

Steak = Broken beef (biefstuk)

Nitrogen = Chokedust (stikstof)

Dustbuster = Crumb thief (kruimeldief)

Racoon = Washing bear (wasbeer)

The weather =  The again (het weer)

Sunscreen = Sunburn (zonnebrand)

Dentist = Teeth doctor (tandarts)

Cafè latte = Coffee wrong (probably bc it’s more milk than coffee) (koffie verkeerd)

Peanut butter = Peanut cheese (pindakaas)

So a normal Dutch text translated= When I’m with my olders we like to drink a coffee wrong and eat a buttered ham with peanut cheese. It was really nice, we all nutted. The again was really cold, so we put on our hand shoes.

We can also put -je after every noun. By that you mean the smaller version. 

For example: 

jas = jacket | jasje = little jacket

shirt = shirt | shirtje = little shirt

boek = book | boekje = little book

It applies to every word. It’s quite useful, but some parents EXCLUSIVELY use these ‘little words’  when talking to kids. 
For example: put on your little shirt and little jacket. Than you can read your little book.

Thanksgiving on the beach was always special. 🏖️🦞 and her elves were planning a feast that would make even the seagulls jealous—stuffed coconuts, kelp pies, and pumpkin sandcakes. But as busy as they were, they never forgot the true meaning of the holiday: gratitude and giving.

One morning, 🏖️🦞 noticed a few elves looking frazzled. “What’s wrong?” she asked. “Some people on Temu keep begging for clicks but never give back,” one elf replied. 🏖️🦞 chuckled. “Ah, but that’s their loss,” she said. “When you give freely, you hold the real magic. Let’s show them how it’s done.”

That day, the elves worked harder than ever, sharing 🌞💋’s with random players. The joy they felt from giving lifted their spirits, and soon they were humming holiday tunes while preparing their feast. And when the elves saw their own codes 🌞💋’d in return, they realized that kindness often has a way of circling back.

My fiancé (F33) and I (M32) have lived together for five years. We’re happy, expecting a child, careers going reasonably well etc etc. The one problem we have is that how untidy she is. We/she have generally got better at downstairs shared space and we try to clean up dishes put away straight away, hoover frequently etc. The main problem is upstairs. We have a 3 bed house. We share one bedroom that we sleep in (my wardrobes are in here) she has a double bedroom to herself for her clothes, a small box sized bedroom for her dressing room. 

All of her aspects of these are beyond a joke. Her side of the bed, clothes; her double bedroom - I literally can’t move in there and some of my clothes are in there; her dressing room - anything and everything is in here and the floor is barely visible. 

She is pregnant so I don’t want to be too blunt or brutal but I also want to ensure that we can manage space better before the introduction of child to even further add to the space. I am trying to do more around the house than I normally would. I.e 70/30 or 80/20 rather than 50/50 as she obviously has a lot on her plate but her own areas need to be looked after as it’s not my things to sort out and impacts me as I still need to use the rooms. 

Every time we discuss these situations in the last, she gets upset/reactive. At the minute she’s saying sorry she’ll sort it when I can but I’m trying to suggest that we’ve been here a million times and I’m more bothered about her changing her habits than apologising. I’m met with “my sorry isn’t good enough then”. 


She also says things like she was always going to tidy it, has been busy, has been ill, has had a lot on. My point is that it shouldn’t have got to the point where an entire weekend is needed to tidy a bedroom. Instead, she should have habits which ensure the build up doesn’t get to an unmanageable amount. Last night I came in from a 14 ish hour shift to a house that stunk. I went digging to find a travel coffee mug that smelt so bad it had pretty much turned solid. The smell was still there this morning after candles and cleaning. I was tidying the bathroom and went to use a plastic bag from her dressing room to throw the rubbish in and there was an old McDonald’s. The bedroom is full of cups, clothes, bags etc because of how she doesn’t take one second tidy decisions which build up to hours. E.g. can’t decide what to wear? Put five outfits on the bed, wear one and leave the rest there. Where are my socks? Somewhere in this bag, tip the bag upside down and leave them there. Need some clean clothes from the washing basket? Tip the basket upside down and find the rest from there. In a few of these decisions a once tidy room is a tip to look at and takes an age to tidy. I suggested how I put my clothes away as soon as I take them upstairs most of the time. If I don’t, when I run a bath I use that as tidy bedroom time. My partner baths daily. That’s 6 x15 minute tidy sessions which will keep on top of everything 

What advice would you give to her to make her change her habits? How do I deal with this?",1,1732019360.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

I(29M) met this girl(28F) online a couple of weeks ago, and we had some really good conversations. I asked her if she wanted to shift the chat to Telegram, but she said she preferred WhatsApp. However, I hesitated because I wasn’t sure if she was real or a catfish (regretting that badly now).

The next day, we happened to be in the same area, and I had a short break from work so we decided to meet up for a quick coffee. We only had about two hours since I had to get back to work. Everything went well during the meetup, we held hands and even shared a kiss. I have to add that she made the first move to hold hands and kiss.

I get that we may have moved a bit fast, but I really felt a connection and I believe she felt it too. 

After I had to leave, I dropped her off at the bus stop she usually goes to catch the bus back home. I texted her after saying I’d like to see her again and she responded positively even suggesting where we could go next time.

But here’s where I’m confused, I haven’t heard from her since then. I’ve sent three follow up messages (spaced about a week apart), but I haven’t received any response. She also hasn’t logged into the platform since her last message. (Can see last seen)

I’m honestly worried about her and don’t know what to do. I’ve been thinking about her constantly since we met and it’s affecting my ability to focus on other things. I don’t think she’s ghosting me. Otherwise, why wouldn’t she have logged into the platform? But I’m not sure what’s going on.

I even considered waiting at the bus stop where I dropped her off, but I don’t know her schedule and I’m afraid it might come across as stalker-ish.

Any advice on what I should do? 
I know I should be patient, but I’m really afraid something bad has happened to her.

Resolvi dar um passo a mais no espresso caseiro.,"Após várias leituras aqui na comunidade, recomendações valiosas e vídeos no YouTube, resolvi dar um passo adiante na minha jornada pelo café espresso. Fiz algumas aquisições, que mostrarei mais adiante, mas confesso que também surgiu um grande receio.

Atualmente, uso minha humilde Mondial Dolce Crema, com a qual tive boas experiências com café em cápsulas. Minha régua de qualidade está, até então, ajustada ao que elas me entregam, e eu estou satisfeito com isso.

Porém, quando o assunto é preparar o café com o filtro pressurizado, as experiências quase sempre deixaram a desejar. Raramente consegui uma bebida que eu realmente considerasse aceitável. Sem dominar os termos técnicos, acredito que as extrações eram frequentemente subextraídas.

Os cafés que usei foram principalmente o **3 Corações Gourmet** (exceto o Dark) e, mais recentemente, o **L’OR Gourmet Intenso**, que, na minha opinião, foi o pior de todos. Em algumas ocasiões, o café extraído não me proporcionava a sensação de realmente estar bebendo um café.

Li aqui que café de cápsula não é o parâmetro ideal de qualidade, mas, com base nas minhas experiências humildes, ficaria muito feliz em conseguir extrair manualmente algo com a mesma qualidade que obtenho usando as cápsulas.

Por isso, resolvi investir em novos equipamentos. Vou detalhar minhas aquisições e gostaria que vocês, com a experiência que têm e considerando os materiais que terei à disposição, compartilhassem comigo:  
Será que conseguirei finalmente extrair uma boa bebida, mesmo com equipamentos e máquina limitados.

Hey, fellow wanderlusters! 🌍 If you've ever found yourself knee-deep in travel plans, you know that choosing the right travel insurance is just as crucial as picking the perfect pair of walking shoes. With the rise of digital nomads, the insurance landscape is evolving, and we now have two main contenders: Nomad-Focused Insurance and Traditional Travel Insurance. Let’s dive into what sets these apart and help you decide which might be your travel companion. 🚀

**🔍 Understanding the Basics**

Before we choose sides, let’s break it down. Traditional travel insurance is like a trusty travel buddy that covers your back for occasional trips, emergencies, and those infamous baggage mishaps. It’s great for the typical two-week vacation or short business trips. 

On the flip side, Nomad-Focused Insurance is the new kid on the block, designed with digital nomads and long-term travelers in mind. These policies often come with extended coverage periods and specific perks that cater to a more flexible, on-the-go lifestyle. Ideal if your ""office"" is a beach in Thailand one month and a co-working space in Berlin the next! 🌴✈️

**🛡️ Coverage Needs: What's Different?**

1. **Duration & Flexibility**:
   - *Traditional Insurance*: Usually caps coverage for 30 to 90 days per trip.
   - *Nomad-Focused*: Offers coverage for months, even years, adapting to your ever-changing itinerary.

2. **Medical & Emergency Support**:
   - *Traditional*: Covers standard medical emergencies and trip cancellations.
   - *Nomad-Focused*: Often includes comprehensive health insurance, telemedicine services, and evacuation from remote locations. Perfect for those daring adventures off the beaten path.

3. **Tech and Equipment Protection**:
   - Many nomad policies offer extras like protection for your gadgets. Say goodbye to anxiety about your laptop during those long train journeys or coffee shop mishaps. 📱💻

**💡 Practical Tips for Choosing Your Fit**

- **Assess Your Travel Style**: If you're parked in one place with short getaways, traditional might suffice. But, if you're hopping continents with no fixed return date, look at nomad options.
  
- **Dig Into the Details**: Compare not just the cost but the fine print. Looking past the sticker price can save you a lot more in unexpected situations.
  
- **Check Online Reviews**: Other travelers’ experiences can shed light on the reliability and claims process of the provider.

Watch her whole mood and voice change every time poor L comes near her! 
She sat with baby A doing her hair, calling her pretty and kissing her while L was alone in his room the whole time. Finally they went to the kitchen and she asked baby A to choose something to eat. This is when L came out and was barely acknowledged, and also wasn’t asked what he wanted. He said he wanted a bowl too so he wasn’t left out then got yelled at that he didn’t actually want the same thing that baby A had picked out. He was given some hot fries and told to find some business to keep himself busy in his room(again) and she went to go eat Rotel with baby A. 🥰🥰🥰 
Giving toddlers chips and sips of her old coffee for lunch is diabolical in itself but this level of favoritism is heartbreaking. 
L came back out and her whole mood changed once again, annoyed, angry and grossed out! She also told him he „stinks bro“. She kept rolling her eyes at him, telling him to back off and get away from her. She doesn’t bathe him, she doesn’t do his hair, she doesn’t even WANT to feed him or spend any time with him. He is neglected and needs to be saved or he will have a lot of mental trauma from being treated this way! And this is what she’s willing to do on camera imagine behind closed doors. She does not deserve children!! 
She kisses baby A‘s hands and constantly calls her pretty and cute, and would not even help L wash his hands when he said they’re dirty. She told him to lick them.

This is proof of how fake her TikTok videos are because in her Walmart hauls with him for views & money she treats him like she would baby A. As the sister said she puts on a show for TikTok it’s all fake. If her sister was right about that she’s also right about other things 💊💊
STOP ENABLING HER!! He‘s constantly trying to hug her and saying she’s the best mother, this is a trauma response! This is not normal behaviour of a 3 year old! He is desperately trying to get any love and affection out of her 💔😞😔",5,1732019042.0,justanotherbabymama,14,1.0,False

Took 2 strong coffees.. it got maybe little better... But it still was very horible. Now, in the afternoon,  my mood seems to be finally more stable and not as low as in the morning. But it is still bad.

Here are 4 ideas (but I'm open to completely different ones):

**1. AGI Timeline Prediction Market** (🎯 no real money, just bragging rights)

* Finally settle those ""AGI by 2030?"" debates with some skin in the game
* Watch your prediction accuracy score climb (or hilariously tank)
* Monthly milestone tracking to see who really knows their stuff
* Like fantasy football, but for the robot apocalypse

**2. AI Model Release Calendar**

* Never miss another GPT launch again
* Compare models without diving into 50 different Discord servers
* Clear ""what can it actually do?"" benchmarks
* Get pinged when something wild drops

**3. Research Paper Difficulty Rater**

* Browser extension that saves you from opening papers way above your pay grade
* Community ratings from ""ELI5"" to ""PhD Required""
* Shows what you need to know before diving in
* ""Time to comprehend"" estimates (coffee breaks vs weekend projects)

**4. AI Progress Newsletter + Extension**

* Track what you've actually read vs. saved for ""later"" (we all know how that goes)
* Weekly TL;DR of the important stuff
* Focus on real breakthroughs, not just PR
* Impact ratings from ""neat trick"" to ""call Elon""

Before I dive in and build one of these - has anyone seen something similar already?

I wanted to share my recent experience applying for a Spain visa in London with the premium lounge service, and hopefully hear from others about their timelines.

My appointment was scheduled for 12:15 PM on 12/11/2024. However, when I arrived, there was a long queue outside the building. Despite it being a premium service, I didn’t get inside until 1:15 PM. The whole process was done by around 1:45 PM.

A few things I noticed:
	•	Walk-ins seem to be an option, even though there’s no sign or clear communication about it.
	•	The premium lounge wasn’t exactly premium—there were empty cans and coffee cups everywhere, making it feel quite messy.

I received an SMS the following morning, but I haven’t gotten any updates about my passport yet. Has anyone applied around the same time and received their passport already? How long did it take for you?

Whether you’re browsing the web, streaming your favorite shows, or shopping online, a VPN (Virtual Private Network) can provide an added layer of protection for your personal data. However, VPN services, especially the most popular ones like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and CyberGhost, can sometimes be on the pricier side. The good news is that there are plenty of **VPN discount codes** available to help you save money while still enjoying top-tier online security.

This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about finding the best **VPN discounts**, what to look for, and how to apply these deals so you can get the most out of your subscription. Whether you’re a first-time buyer or a long-time VPN user, this article will help you save big without compromising on quality.

# Why You Need a VPN in 2024

Before we dive into the details of how to find VPN discounts, let’s quickly review why having a VPN is crucial in today’s internet environment.

# 1. Protect Your Privacy

A VPN hides your real IP address and encrypts your internet traffic, ensuring that no one can track your online activities. This is especially important in a world where hackers, advertisers, and even governments are increasingly watching what you do online.

# 2. Secure Public Wi-Fi

When you connect to public Wi-Fi, such as at coffee shops or airports, you’re vulnerable to hackers. A VPN secures your connection, making it much harder for anyone to intercept your data.

# 3. Bypass Geo-Restrictions

A VPN allows you to mask your location, which is helpful if you want to access content that is restricted in your region. Whether it’s streaming services like Netflix or accessing websites that are blocked in certain countries, a VPN opens up a world of content.

# 4. Prevent Throttling

Some internet service providers (ISPs) slow down your connection when they detect heavy usage (like streaming or gaming). With a VPN, you can bypass these throttling measures and enjoy faster speeds.

# Types of VPN Discounts

When searching for **VPN discount codes**, it’s important to know what kinds of deals are available. Here are some common types of VPN discounts you’ll come across:

# 1. Percentage Off Deals

Many VPN providers offer percentage-based discounts, where you can get anywhere from **10% to 70% off** the regular price. These discounts are typically offered during special promotions like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or the provider’s anniversary.

# Example:

* **ExpressVPN** might offer **50% off** for a **1-year subscription**.
* **NordVPN** might provide a **68% discount** on their **2-year plan**.

# 2. Free Trial or Money-Back Guarantee

Some VPN services provide a **free trial** period (usually ranging from **7 to 30 days**) so you can test out their features without committing. If you decide that the VPN isn’t for you, many providers offer a **money-back guarantee** that allows you to get a full refund.

# Example:

* **CyberGhost VPN** offers a **45-day money-back guarantee**.
* **NordVPN** has a **30-day money-back policy** for all plans.

# 3. Referral Programs

Referral discounts allow you to save money by referring a friend or family member to the VPN service. Typically, both you and the person you refer will get a discount or free months of service.

# Example:

* **Surfshark** gives **1 month free** for both the referrer and the referred.

# 4. Seasonal Promotions

During major sales events like **Black Friday**, **Cyber Monday**, or **Christmas**, VPN providers often drop their prices significantly. These are some of the best times to buy a VPN subscription, as the discounts are typically huge.

# How to Find VPN Discount Codes

Now that you know what kinds of discounts are available, let’s talk about the best ways to find these **VPN discount codes**.

# 1. Official Websites

Many VPN providers offer discounts directly on their official websites. If you're looking for a seasonal deal or a special promotion, checking the VPN provider’s homepage or **pricing page** is a good place to start.

# 2. Deal Websites and Forums

Websites like **RetailMeNot**, **Groupon**, and **Honey** aggregate discount codes for various services, including VPNs. You can also check out **Reddit**, where users often post the latest VPN deals in forums like r/VPN or r/Deals.

# 3. Social Media and Newsletters

Follow VPN providers on **Twitter**, **Facebook**, and **Instagram** for special promotions and announcements. Many companies share exclusive discounts with their social media followers. Additionally, subscribing to the **VPN provider’s newsletter** will give you early access to promotions and discounts.

# 4. Coupon Aggregators

Some websites specialize in listing verified discount codes. Examples include [**Coupons.com**](http://Coupons.com) and **CouponBirds**. These sites can save you time by providing a list of all available codes.

# How to Use VPN Discount Codes

Using a VPN discount code is simple. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you apply your coupon:

# 1. Choose Your VPN Plan

Go to the VPN provider’s website and select the plan that suits your needs. Most providers offer **monthly**, **yearly**, or **2-year** plans, with the long-term options offering the best value.

# 2. Apply the Discount Code

Once you’ve chosen your plan, proceed to the checkout page. Look for a box that says **“Enter Promo Code”** or **“Discount Code”**. Paste your code into the box and click **“Apply”**. You should see the discount reflected in the final price.

# 3. Complete the Purchase

Fill in your payment information and complete the purchase. Some VPN providers accept various payment methods, including **credit cards**, **PayPal**, and even **cryptocurrency**.

# Tips for Maximizing Your VPN Discount

Here are a few tips to make sure you’re getting the best deal possible:

# 1. Combine Deals

Look for ways to stack deals. For example, some VPN providers may offer seasonal discounts on top of the discount codes shared on websites or forums. If you can combine multiple discounts, you can save even more.

# 2. Use the Money-Back Guarantee

If you’re unsure about a VPN, take advantage of the **money-back guarantee**. Try out the service and, if it’s not what you expected, get your money back and try another VPN service.

# 3. Opt for Long-Term Plans

Generally, longer subscription plans offer more significant discounts. If you’re sure you want to use a VPN long-term, choose a **2-year or 3-year plan** to get the best price.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Here are 4 ideas (but I'm open to completely different ones):

**1. AGI Timeline Prediction Market** (🎯 no real money, just bragging rights)

* Finally settle those ""AGI by 2030?"" debates with some skin in the game
* Watch your prediction accuracy score climb (or hilariously tank)
* Monthly milestone tracking to see who really knows their stuff
* Like fantasy football, but for the robot apocalypse

**2. AI Model Release Calendar**

* Never miss another GPT launch again
* Compare models without diving into 50 different Discord servers
* Clear ""what can it actually do?"" benchmarks
* Get pinged when something wild drops

**3. Research Paper Difficulty Rater**

* Browser extension that saves you from opening papers way above your pay grade
* Community ratings from ""ELI5"" to ""PhD Required""
* Shows what you need to know before diving in
* ""Time to comprehend"" estimates (coffee breaks vs weekend projects)

**4. AI Progress Newsletter + Extension**

* Track what you've actually read vs. saved for ""later"" (we all know how that goes)
* Weekly TL;DR of the important stuff
* Focus on real breakthroughs, not just PR
* Impact ratings from ""neat trick"" to ""call Elon""

Before I dive in and build one of these - has anyone seen something similar already? 

What would make these actually useful vs just another tool that collects dust?

P.S. Open to wildly different ideas or improvements too. Maybe we need something completely different to track our march towards AGI?",0,1732018694.0,learnmachinelearning,1,0.5,False

But this year, I really disassociated and after my last date failed miserably, I've come peace to the fact that I'll never date again. Or so I thought.

I installed Bumble a while back, and I have to say got pretty surprised since I realized that I don't have it in me anymore. Not playing the age card, I'm just 28, but I can't keep up. In fact, the moment they open up the conversation, I would just then ask the most boring questions in the world. I used to open up with witty remarks, ask their music taste, and tell me a random fact but like I said I just don't have it in me. I managed to meet someone.

Even after meeting someone, I used to keep my options open unless there's a clear indicator that we're exclusive. It has always been like this, but I'm not sure why I decided to actually stop swiping after we transferred to Instagram. I still did, but it's more like an act of boredom and I left the new messages unread.

Everything felt like actual peace, totally no worry if one responds late since we're busy with our own lives. We talk about our day, or send reels (she sends from TikTok, I send from Instagram), or basically just talk about the most random shit. I never had to worry that she wouldn't respond anymore, while previously I was always anxious since I mostly respond late.

Fast forward, we agreed to meet. It's been a month+ of talking, and we just watched a movie. Had coffee, ate ramen, and walked her home afterward. For the first time in years, I walked someone home. While walking, she said ""ang saya nito, lakad lang"". I'm trying so hard to hide my smile because it's a personal favorite, walk dates. In the era of dates having to be expensive, she specifically found joy in walking, and in this instance, with me.

No mention of sex or whatsoever, we never even hugged or held hands. But everything was enough, she was. It's also a plus since I've been trying to abstain after being sexually active for a very long while. And again, I don't have it in me anymore.

Bihira ako kiliigin, pero kinilig ulit ako. Umabot sa point na pati yung date naikwento ko sa client ko nung tinanong niya ako kung anong ginawa ko last weekend. Sinabi niya pa na ""you were smiling for like 2 minutes before telling me what it was, now I know why"". Hindi ako naniniwala sa mga jinx, pero bigla akong napahiling kay Lord na balato niya na sa akin to. Wala rin akong balak makipagrelasyon ngayon, at medyo matagal na rin akong single, pero kung sakali. Siya na lang please.
