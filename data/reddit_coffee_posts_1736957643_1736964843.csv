Total funk for a few years and just started sleeping most of the time. 

So I tried a bunch of psych meds and therapy, didn’t do shit.  Finally decided to consider TRT, got hooked up with Alpha MD and tested at 175 which I think is probably lower than my baseline, I was at 450 a couple years ago.

So what I wanna do is use TRT to get my health and ability to focus back and establish some good patterns, I used to be regular gym guy and a mountain bike racer, if I can get back into that zone, I’m hoping I could come off TRT. 

I don’t know if there’s any experiences on here with people who tried to consider a similar strategy?  I just worry about the long-term effects and possible side effects. And frankly, I don’t wanna be a daily user of anything but coffee and my athletic greens.",1,1736964699.0,trt,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone! I slept in today (oops), but I still wanted to stick to a cozy, productive routine. Here’s how I adjusted my day starting from noon:

🌞 Late Morning/Afternoon (12:00 PM – 1:30 PM)
	•	12:00 PM: Wake up, sip on lemon water, and do a quick self-care routine (brush teeth, wash face, moisturizer).
	•	12:15 PM: Gentle stretch or yoga (5-10 mins) to wake up.
	•	12:30 PM: Brunch: Oatmeal w/ almond butter, banana, chia seeds, & cinnamon + herbal tea or decaf coffee.
	•	1:00 PM: Tidy a small space (desk, bedside table) or create a playlist for the day.

✨ Afternoon (1:30 PM – 3:00 PM)
	•	1:30 PM: Work on something creative or practical: journaling, drawing, or planning your week.
	•	I use the Pomodoro method: 25 mins work, 5 mins break.
	•	2:30 PM: Movement break: Take a short walk or follow a gentle YouTube workout. I focus on sensory grounding (pay attention to sounds, textures, and surroundings).

💡 Mid-Afternoon (3:00 PM – 4:00 PM)
	•	Snack time: Apple slices + sunflower seed butter or nuts/dried fruit.
	•	Dive into a brainy activity:
	•	Learn something new (Duolingo, podcasts, or research).
	•	Organize a to-do list or brainstorm for a project.

🍴 Early Evening (4:00 PM – 5:30 PM)
	•	4:00 PM: Get hands-on: Cook or bake something fun (muffins are my fave!) or tidy up while listening to music.
	•	5:00 PM: Early dinner: Grilled chicken/tofu wrap w/ spinach, avocado, & hummus + steamed broccoli.

🌸 Evening Recharge (5:30 PM – 7:00 PM)
	•	Play with something sensory-friendly (kinetic sand, ASMR, or coloring).
	•	Take 10-15 minutes to rest if needed.

🛁 Cozy Evening (7:00 PM – 8:00 PM)
	•	Warm bath or skincare routine to wind down.
	•	Cozy clothes, dim lighting, and a comfort show or movie.
	•	End the day by journaling: Write 3 good things about today or set plans for tomorrow.

1i23kjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ourtownreno/comments/1i23kjt/putting_the_real_choices_womens_center_a_crisis/,"Putting the Real Choices Women's Center, a ""Crisis Pregnancy Center,"" under the microscope","In a bedroom in the upstairs of a home on Haskell Street, at the Real Choices Women’s Center, which advertises itself as an “abortion clinic alternative,” visitors come to consult with staff members about their pregnancy.  
  
The room contains three chairs and a coffee table. No medical equipment or examination tables are present. A white noise machine hangs from the door knob of the consultation room.   
  
The aim here is to discourage pregnant women from seeking abortions.   
  
A crisis pregnancy center is defined as a non-profit organization established by anti-abortion and often religious groups with the goal of dissuading pregnant people from getting abortions. In the United States, crisis pregnancy centers now outnumber abortion clinics roughly four to one. There are an estimated 2500-4000 crisis pregnancy centers in the U.S., and only 807 abortion clinics.   
  
Maureen Scott, co-founder of Wild West Access Fund of Nevada, an abortion fund based in Nevada, describes crisis pregnancy centers as a serious problem in Northern Nevada that needs to be dealt with.   
  
“Crisis Pregnancy Centers, AKA fake clinics, aim to misinform patients about abortion care in an effort to propagate their anti-choice agenda, disrespecting patient bodily autonomy in the process,” Scott said. “These fake clinics do not have medical staff, and often classify themselves as religious or non-profit organizations to skirt regulations placed on healthcare facilities.”   
  
According to non-profit tax forms, Real Choices Women's Center is owned and operated by the husband and wife team of Corey and Nicku Bruce, with two locations: the one pictured in Midtown and one in Fernley. The center offers a variety of different services including pregnancy testing, “options” consultations, and abortion recovery. The majority of the staff working inside these centers providing consultations are not medical professionals or professionally trained in any women’s health fields. In a response to a google review, the center stated their staff were “certified crisis coaches.”  
  
  
Google Reviews concerning Real Choices Women’s Center with the executive director of Real Choices Women’s Center, Nicku Bruce, in center.   
  
In google reviews dating back seven years, former visitors to the center describe the uncomfortable pressure they faced from Real Choices Women's Center staff members during consultations.  
  
Google Reviewer Monique Ida wrote, “If you feel like being trapped in a room & bombarded with weird propaganda by a pack of rabid evangelicals cosplaying as nurses, this is the place for you.”   
  
The center responded to this review, claiming to have never seen Ida as a patient.   
  
  
Real Choices Women’s Center operates out of a typical Reno home. Visitors are brought to the upstairs of the home before sitting down with a consultant to engage in an intake process involving two forms and a 40 minute discussion prior to their pregnancy test.  
  
Required forms for an appointment with Real Choices Women’s Center include a demographics portion before a medical history portion. Demographics questions ask patients about their marital status and their yearly income. There are also questions asking about their relationship with God, if they are a Christian, and what their religion is. After the completion of the forms, visitors will make a urine sample that they will keep with them throughout the entirety of their consultation.   
  
Before the consultation can begin, staff members reiterate that they do not perform abortions at Real Choices Women’s Center and will not refer visitors to get an abortion. Despite this, their website says it offers information on abortion pills, procedures and abortions as an option.   
  
During the consultation, visitors are given a paper and pamphlets detailing their options: Adoption, Parenting, and Abortion with pros and cons for each. They are asked to share with their consultant what stands out to them for each. Then, they are asked to engage in a spiritual discussion with their consultant, in which they are asked again what their relationship to God is, their history with religion, how they believe babies come to Earth, and if this impacts their decision on how to proceed with the pregnancy.   
  
Following the consultation, patients are instructed to perform their pregnancy test with their urine sample in front of the consultant and then read their own results.   
  
Following our reporter’s negative pregnancy test result, a nurse talked with her about the possibility of a miscarriage.  
  
Then a consultant, Sarah Beth, returned to the room to encourage her to pursue a relationship with God and assured her she was loved by her creator. Before leaving, our reporter was given a brochure to help her process her negative pregnancy test with portions encouraging abstinence before marriage.   
  
Anti-abortion rhetoric provided at the center in the form of consultations, pamphlets, and flyers included claims that an abortion will impact the ability to have a healthy baby in the future, while portraying an abortion as a “secret” the patient must keep.   
  
The center has recently changed names and goes by many alternative titles online, including: Pregnancy Counseling Center INC., Crisis Pregnancy Centers Midtown and Fernley, and Real Choices Pregnancy Center as evidenced by their flyers and tax forms associated with their organization.  
  
The executive director Nicku Bruce, did not respond to requests for an interview.   
  
On her now inactive X account, Bruce reposted a tweet from Lifeway Women, a Christian blog aimed towards women, saying “Expectancy is the perfect swap for anxiety. We are here expecting Jesus.”   
  
  
Although Nevada’s Question 6 may have passed to protect abortion rights in the state constitution this November, pro-choice Assemblywoman Erica Roth, who won a District 24 state assembly seat, explained to one of our reporters that legal grey areas still allow crisis pregnancy centers to mislead vulnerable patients under the guise of providing reproductive healthcare.   
  
“These centers shouldn’t be able to put themselves out as healthcare providers,” Roth explained. “They don’t have doctors on staff, and yet they provide what essentially amounts to legalized misinformation to people who are scared and unsure about their options.”  
  
Real Choices Women’s Center refers to themselves as a women’s healthcare clinic. Crisis pregnancy centers are not required to have actual doctors or nurse practitioners on staff, and are mainly composed of medical assistants who only need to know how to provide ultrasounds to be employed.   
  
“These centers target people who are vulnerable—those without a regular OB-GYN or primary care provider who are simply Googling for help,” Roth said.  
  
To combat misinformation, Nevada residents can report crisis pregnancy centers for deceptive practices through the Bureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance. Reports can be filed as consumer protection complaints, triggering an investigation that could result in fines, requiring a plan of correction, or other penalties.   
  
Stressing the importance of educating the public about crisis pregnancy centers, Roth highlights the red flags for patients to watch out for including: a lack of qualified medical professionals, such as doctors or nurse practitioners, strong religious undertones in counseling or materials, and advertisements implying abortion services, which are not actually offered.  
  
In Reno, there is only one abortion clinic currently operating: Planned Parenthood located on South Virginia Street, although many OB-GYNs also perform abortions in their own practices.    
  
In terms of abortion rights and access here in Nevada, following the election of Republican Donald Trump to the presidency, Roth noted concerns about possible looming federal actions, such as using the Comstock Act—a law passed in 1873 banning the mailing of ""obscene"" materials, including information about contraception and abortion—to restrict abortion medications sent by mail.  
  
“I think the most likely attack that we will see in the beginning of Trump's term is attacks on the ability to access abortion medication through the mail. There's definitely going to be a tax from the federal level that we need to be prepared to address at the state level,” Roth said. “That includes protecting access, because the right by law to access an abortion is rendered obsolete if we don't have access to that life saving care.”  
  
However, Roth pointed out that Nevada’s Republican Governor Joe Lombardo removed mentions of crisis pregnancy centers from the Department of Health and Human Services website after taking office, making it harder for the public to find information on how to report these centers. The four-paragraph section had been part of an “Abortion Information for Nevadans” page launched in 2022 under then-Governor Steve Sisolak.   
  
According to reporting by the Nevada Current, the section remained online until May 2023, as confirmed by the Wayback Machine, but was removed by early June. Lombardo, who is publicly “pro-life,” justified the decision by calling the section’s characterization of CPCs a “mischaracterization and politicization.”  
  
“Governor Lombardo believes that crisis pregnancy centers offer critical resources, support, and care for pregnant women in Nevada,” his spokesperson Elizabeth Ray was quoted as saying.  
  
  
On the other side of the political aisle, Democratic Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto has been outspoken on her condemnation of crisis pregnancy centers. In 2022, Senator Cortez Masto cosigned legislation to combat misinformation spread by crisis pregnancy centers called the Stop Anti-Abortion Disinformation Act.   
  
“When women need critical care, it's vital that they know all the options available to them so they can make informed decisions. Too often, women visit crisis pregnancy centers expecting comprehensive reproductive healthcare, only to encounter a different experience. This legislation aims to address misleading advertisements by these crisis pregnancy centers,” a representative for Senator Cortez Masto wrote in a statement to our reporting team.  
  
Other crisis pregnancy centers operating in Northern Nevada are Care Net Pregnancy Center in Fallon, and Life Choices Community Pregnancy Clinic in Carson City.   
  
  
At Real Choices Women’s Center, visitors are welcomed to the center with candy bowls, cookies, and promises of compassionate care. Inside its consultation rooms, non-medically trained personnel utilize religious rhetoric and shame surrounding premarital sex as tactics to persuade young women to pursue abstinence and dissuade pregnant women from receiving abortions.

1i23hy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/1i23hy1/barking_dogs_in_public/,Barking Dogs In Public ,"Hello all! I'm very wordy so forgive the wall of text, but all insight will be appreciated here! I (23 y/o) moved across the country last year, and since then have had to work with my dog (5 y/o) on her reactivity now that I have to walk her. For her, reactivity is mainly vocal. She's very friendly with both humans and dogs, just a bit shy off the bat. Since we moved, I've worked very hard to minimize her barking when passing triggers (any dog or human that isn't in sniffing distance), and she's made great strides! She no longer barks at people unless startled, and she listens to me a *bit* more when barking at dogs.

Here's my problem that I'd like insight into from fellow dog owners: she's generally very well behaved and therefore I enjoy occasionally taking her out to public spaces near my apartment. She loves going to the coffee shop down a block and meeting new people! I'm always diligent to not approach dogs on the sidewalk and to make sure dogs are not in the shop before entering. However, I cannot avoid dogs all the time. Plenty of people in the area enjoy doing the same as me. Is it appropriate for me to continue walking her ""in public"" (around businesses and streets as opposed to my residential neighborhood) if she still struggles with barking at a dog she sees across the street? I'm finding it's harder to train her in winter since walks are shorter, and the cold gets her a little more energetic. This is on my mind since I was stuck at a crosswalk, coffee in hand, while she barked at another well behaved dog diagonal of us. It's obvious that other dog owners would not know her history and that she is not aggressive outside of the barking, and I don't want to come across as a self-centered owner nor make other owners uncomfortable. Like I said, I always avoid passing dogs directly and will take the long route if necessary to do so, but I'm not sure that excuses my dogs behavior at a distance. On the other hand, how else is she supposed to get used to seeing other dogs in public? Note: She's not a fan of dog parks. She doesn't play in them, only freezes while other dogs sniff her.

I have read the typical advice from hobby espresso nerds about different machines and grinders, but I'm just a girl trying to level up from my Nespresso machine. Options I am considering right now and price points (in the most simple terms):

1. Breville barista pro - for the upgraded grinder and auto milk frothing options as well as the quicker warm up time $850 retail (or continue the hunt for this machine from tj maxx/home goods/marshalls $499) I have checked all local stores and they seem to be out

2. Breville barista express impress - on sale right now for $650 (crate and barrel loyalty points & gift card), beautiful on the counter, all in one system (beginner friendly)

3. Breville Bambino plus and baraza grinder bundle from Seattle coffee co $650, most ""upgradable"" system, but also potentially more mess and 2 separate appliances on counter, would possible need a tamping setup to make this worthwhile

1i23d29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Turnip28/comments/1i23d29/the_cult_of_the_roasting_chalice/,The Cult of the Roasting Chalice,"A colleague of mine sold me the benefits of chicory as a substitute for coffee with enough arguments to make me think of a cult, and the following concept came to me.

*Origin of the Cult*

 *The cult traces its origins to the ramblings of a mad alchemist-priest, Father Cichor. Legend has it that he stumbled upon the secret during a desperate winter, where roots were plentiful but teeth were brittle. Through fire and steam, Father Cichor claimed to have heard the whispers of the Root’s soul, revealing its yearning to be ""unburdened"" through a process of transformation. He crafted the First Roasting Chalice, a charred brass goblet with a straining mesh and an elongated spout, to perfect his communion with the Root. His initial disciples, drawn by his fervor and the enticing aroma of roasted roots, gathered around this relic, spreading his doctrine throughout the mirelands.* 

*The Sacred Doctrine: ""The Boil, The Blessing""*

 *The Cult of the Roasting Chalice believes that the Root is a cursed gift, its raw form a punishment for humanity’s hubris. Through roasting and infusion, they claim to ""boil away"" its malignity, leaving only its divine essence. This essence, when consumed, bestows fortitude, clarity, and a fleeting reprieve from the crushing despair of existence.* 

*Central to their teachings is the mantra:*

 *""Burn the flesh, cleanse the blight, sip the marrow of life.""* 

*The cult considers eating unroasted roots a heresy punishable by exile, or worse, forced immersion into a vat of boiling root-water—a grim fate they call ""the Final Infusion.""*",2,1736963824.0,Turnip28,0,1.0,False

The machine churns out 18g of beans almost every single time, but dumps out anywhere between 25-67g of espresso. This is on various beans, with and without being at the machines recommended grind setting. 

It seems wildly inconsistent to the point that it makes it very hard to dial in. Anyone else having this issues?

* It is always advisable to keep a notebook and a pen with you when the teacher is teaching. (so that you can immediately write what you think you won't be able to remember later)
* Make your notes by yourself, don't rely on others for this thing. (keep them precise and to the point) - mind maps and flowcharts.
* Try to understand things rather than mugging them up.
* Use mnemonics wherever needed as it makes the content interesting and easier to learn.
* Instead of studying for 3–4 hrs at a stretch, study for let's say 45 –50 minutes then take a 10–15 minute break, this way you will be able to retain and focus more as your brain gets proper rest and prevents you from frequent burnout. (it's called the Pomodoro method).
* Use a highlighter (so when it's your final revision, you are reading only what is needed), sticky notes (if you miss out on any point you can use them) or write anywhere on the book, possibly nearest to the topic you are reading.

* The place that you have chosen for yourself to study should be distraction-free.
* The Feynman technique. It's something we usually do.

>

* Avoid having coffee if you study at night and want to study longer. It’s better to switch to tea or water. (although both coffee and tea aren't good, coffee is more harmful and has long-term effects on your body.)
* Don’t forget to take proper sleep. ( you won't be too productive if you are tired or sleep-deprived)
* Having food at proper times. ( study needs energy too.)
* Last:- train yourself and your brain for all the above-mentioned study tips☺️ also keep revising your notes. (Multiple revision is the key.)

1i23978,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1i23978/new_70_year_old_supervisor_doesnt_seem_to_know/,New 70 year old supervisor doesn't seem to know what personal space is and when I tell her to back up I think she became vindictive. ,"This may be long so bear with me. I (51f) work in a warehouse as a quality specialist. I've been at the company for 5 years, working quality for about 2 and a half years. We work 12 hour shifts so there are four different shifts. There are three quality specialists one for each shift and then one supervisor who is supposed to work that fourth shift maybe not doing all that we do but at least checking case weights (that is the biggest problem we seem to deal with) plus keep our SOPs up to date and oversee things etc. We recently got a new supervisor (70f). Since I had been in this department the longest, they had me train her. She seems very nice, very personable. But she stands very close to me that I can feel her breath on my face. And she follows every single step that I take, right behind me. Every - Single - Step.  At first I thought okay I'm only going to train her for a couple of weeks and then she is going to go on her shift and I'll only see her occasionally, I can do this. I didn't want to be rude because she is my supervisor and she's a 70 year old lady so I felt kind of bad. I was told to make sure that she is trained with everything we do on our job. So while I tried to train her she's told me no she's the supervisor she will watch and I will do. Um okay, I thought. She said this in a very nice way but I was told to make sure that she knows how to do this stuff herself. But I didn't push, after all she made sure she let me know that she is my supervisor 🤷‍♀️. After 3 weeks, our warehouse production manager, who she reports directly to, asked her if she was ready to go to her shift. She waved him off and told him not yet will figure that out later. (Like what the heck is that supposed to mean?) He is a very nice man in his mid 30s and looked a little taken aback and uncomfortable when she said that. He just answered uh, okay.  Well it's been almost 2 months and she's still with me. She has her laptop set up right beside my computer, sitting right next to me to where her arm is smushed against mine and I can't move, her breath in my face.  Still following every single step that I take. At first she tried to follow me every time I went into the bathroom too, her not even using it, just standing in there outside the stalls. But I guess I must have involuntarily given her a WTF look because she actually looked at me, eyes wide, said ohh, walked out and never did that again. I'm on the Safety committee and when I said I was going to a meeting she followed me there. I told her no, it's okay she can wait for me in the office she said no no I'll go too, if you're on the Safety committee so am I. Like I cannot get away from her to  just breathe. If I think out loud she says what did you say. And I'll say nothing I'm talking to myself and she'll insist to know what I said. Like I can't even have my own thoughts to myself. I have never made a mistake in my job. I'm not saying I'm perfect but I have never made a mistake. I have also never forgot to clock in. Because this woman is invading my space so much and makes me feel so icky and claustrophobic at my job I have now made a mistake and have forgotten to clock in twice. When I made the mistake the very nice Warehouse production manager came to let me know. He said it was okay but just try not to do that again. Right after that happened I go into the QC office to input the case weights that I just collected, supervisor once again sitting right next to me, her arm smushed against mine, her breath in my face. Talking non-stop while I'm trying to work. When she does this I cannot think at all, and now I'm upset because I was told I made a mistake. So I very firmly and very strongly said to her ""back up, you need to back up. This is my personal space and you are in my personal space. I cannot work with you basically sitting in my lap. It is making me not be able to think and now I am making mistakes. I have had to go to HR because I have forgotten to clock in twice now because I don't even want to come to work because you follow me everywhere and you need to stop. You are supposed to go on the other shift so why are you not going? You only worry about this shit there are three other shifts you should be worrying about too. I am sorry, I do not mean to be rude but it is going on 2 months now."" She looked strickened, and immediately started apologizing. I actually felt a little bad. She said she is sorry but she felt that we made a great team together. Like WTF. I said we're not supposed to be a team together that there are two other people that do the same job as me and we're all supposed to be a team together. They actually work night work and I don't think she wants to go on nights to work with them. Her shift is the other day shift. I tell that her supposedly shift has nobody there because she's here on this shift. I've seen many pallets pulled from that shift because there is no quality person on that shift checking anything. And she just kept saying but we make such a great team. It was weird. I just went on with my job she actually listened backed up and did not hover on top of me for the rest of the day. We had two days off and when we returned, I came in like any other day. I always have a cup tray with two coffees in it and I set my car keys in one of the other cup holding places on the tray. This is something I do everyday and everyone knows this. We share the quality office with a gentleman who has worked at the company about 4 years.  He only uses the office to input his data. He comes in quickly puts in the computer whatever he's done and then he leaves. He is in and out of the office throughout the day.  We have work together in this office for over 2 years. On a whole, we get along. I have really had no problems with him other than this past summer when we had a difference of opinions and another time I believe he took my pens but that was nothing really. So back to my coffees. I come to work, the supervisor is there and she greets me like nothing had happened the other day. I put my bag, my coffee tray with my coffee and keys in it on the table like I do everyday, grab my clipboard and go out on the floor to gather my case weights. Of course the supervisor follows right behind me like nothing was ever said to her about this before. She left me for a little bit. I didn't think anything about it, I thought maybe she went to the bathroom. I looked towards the offices and saw that she was in the QC office. Again I thought nothing of it. She then reappeared right beside me as I was finishing up my case weights. I go back into the office go to get a drink of coffee before I start inputting my case weights into the computer and notice that my coffee tray is gone. I start to panic. The coffee's piss me off but my car keys that were on it scare the crap out of me thinking someone took them. I actually ran to look out the window thinking someone took my car. Thank goodness my car was still there. The supervisor actually started panicking saying oh my goodness your keys were in it. She starts helping me to look. The gentleman that uses the office for his computer came in and I told him what happened and he started helping too. I should mention that the pen incident was someone took my pens and when I asked him if anyone came in the office he stuttered and was weird and said ""I didn't take your pens"". Which was funny because I didn't ask him if he took my pens I asked him if he saw anybody come in the office. But that was all that happened with that. And this is my car keys so this is a lot worse than pens. He was not weird like he was over the pens. He didn't stutter and act scared. Which I feel that he would if he did something with them. If you're going to stutter and act scared over a couple of ink pens, you're going to definitely act like that over someones car keys if you are guilty. But like I said he was calm and helpful. The lady supervisor right away said the cleaning lady was in here she probably threw them away. I said the cleaning lady comes in every day and never touches anything on the tables and she knows that these are my coffees and would never touch them. I went and asked the cleaning lady and she said no she did not. I asked her if she noticed if my tray with my coffee was in the trash when she emptied it. She said she did not notice she just throws the bags out she doesn't look in them. Then the supervisor said that the gentleman did it. I said I honestly don't believe that he did. Because of the way he acted over my pens and how he's acting now. He is very calm and helpful and I don't think that he would do that. She said yes but you said he took your pens that time (I had told her jokingly when she first started keep a hold of her pens because he'll take them). I said he took pens because he needed a pen to write and is too lazy to go get his own. Why would he take my keys? This is different, this is personal. We told the shift supervisor and he let HR know so that they could look at the cameras. Now at first the supervisor said ""well the only people that were in the office was the cleaning lady and the gentleman"" but I know she was in the office because I saw her. but I didn't say anything. She asked can the camera see in the office. No the cameras cannot see in the office but they can see who went in the office. Then she said well I was in there for just a minute. It was all so fishy, she was fishy. So I started thinking I bet she did it. Of course they look on the camera and they see just the cleaning lady, the gentleman and her going in and out. So it was one of those three people. She said so you don't think it's the cleaning lady? No. So you must think it's the gentleman then? Nope. So then who do you think it is?, she's asks. 🤷‍♀️. I'm not going to accuse her outright because you can't see in the office and she is my new supervisor. But I do believe it's her. HR wanted to speak to me and they asked me what I thought. I told them that I believe it's her. When I explained everything that happened, HR actually believes it is too. That she was angry at me for telling her to get out of my personal space and that she supposed to be on the other shift. HR asked why she is not on the other shift because that is where she's supposed to go. I told her what happened when the warehouse production manager asked her that and how she basically waved him off saying we'll worry about that later and how he just looked uncomfortable like he didn't want to tell her no you have to go there now. She said she's going to talk to him. I found my keys in the trash by the compactor, covered in coffee. I was able to clean them off and hopefully they don't stick once the coffee inside dries. I told HR that I found my keys and even though I believe it is her we can't prove it. I don't wish to make it a big deal. But I know how she is now and I will keep my eyes wide open but she does need to go to the other shift. I don't mind working with her occasionally but she cannot be in my personal space and follow me every step I take every day it is taking a toll on my mental health. HR agreed because I am doing things that I have never done in the five years that I have been there, like forgetting to clock in. She is going to handle it. I hope she does because I cannot take this much longer. HR also told me to be mindful around her now that it looks like she can be vindictive. Oh I will.  I went back to work not wanting to speak but of course the supervisor wants to talk Non-Stop and she keeps talking about my keys. She said ""do you want to know what I think, I think that whoever did it just wanted to throw your coffee out because maybe they were mad at you for something and they didn't see your keys. They thought it was just your coffee they were throwing out, they probably saw the cleaning lady coming and hurried up to through your coffee in the trash thinking she'll take it out and haha your coffee is gone. I don't think they meant to throw your your keys out too, I don't think they even knew they were there"". And I just think to myself, keep telling on yourself lady. And HR please hurry up and put her on that other shift because I cannot do this much longer. ",6,1736963540.0,coworkerstories,0,0.88,False

“When you enter the shop, it has the uncanny smell of freshly-baked bread, sweet cakes, meat pies, pumpkin spice, and warm sweaters.  You have never in your life thought of ‘warm sweaters’ having a smell – that’s odd thing to think about...  A set of brass bells ring when you enter – their tiny sonorous tinkling seems to last longer than it should.  The bakery also is much larger on the interior than it appears on its exterior.  When you enter – there are several moments where you are given the freedom to look around because nobody seems to be present.  There are perfectly clear glass cases showing of delectable baked goods.  Every single one looks absolutely perfect.  Small round breads glisten with some kind of tasty coating – piping hot meat pies sit steaming, slightly fogging the glass, large loaves of bread sit, ready to devour.  There are also a couple shelves across from the baked goods with various novelties.  One shelf has about 10 small silver-gilded cages with tiny animals inside – no more than 2” tall – one has a small animated bear, one of them has a tiny badger and an wooly elephant.  There is even a strange lizard and even smaller ducks float in a ½” deep pond. 

""The next shelf has a series of various colored jars – with some swirly vapors contained within, stoppered with corks and with tiny bows.  Other bottles are filled with clear shimmering liquid"" (DM Note -these are collected 'memories' as the Encode Thoughts Wizard cantrip.  These memories can be used to further the plot of the campaign... ""I'd like to see the day that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_... or ""show me this person or this event"")

If you do voices - the Madame talks like 'Professor Umbridge' from Harry Potter - sickly sweet and grandmotherly.  

‘Welcome to the Sweet shop!  What are you interested in?’  A short, corpululent ‘woman’ appears, barely peeks over the glass cases and waves a fat, stubby hand in the air.  She stops, walks back into some storage room, produces a small 3 step ladder, steps upon it and you can see her in all her 4’ tall glory.  This woman is as wide as she is tall and has no neck.  She is wearing a copious amount of cosmetics – in fact, her face is so powdered that she looks like pixie dust is falling from her when she moves.  She gives you a large, toothless smile which extends out much farther than it should, squeezing her cheeks to completely cover her tiny black eyes. Her rosy cheeks and dark red lipstick do not actually enhance her appearance and appear to be haphazardly applied - as if by an amateur.  She notices you staring...  “Ahem – what can I do for you today?”

*  Delectable donuts –  “A sweet, honey-coated bread - for a more discerning pallet” Give advantage on Intelligence checks and saves for 24 hours. (DM Info - Strangely specific, but this is for a 'Mindflayer' campaign where failing INT checks have nearly destroyed the party)
* Too-Hot Spice Crumble Cookies – “Sometimes, you just need to speak your mind for self care – violently”.  When eaten, a barbarian is immediately sent into rage.  If any other class does it – you don’t really know what would happen…
* Tiny animals – “Make sure to feed it every day – I can’t guarantee results if you don’t keep it fed or make it angry!”  These have had the 'reduce' spell placed upon them.  If you fail to feed them, the spell breaks, and they return to their normal size - wreaking havoc at the most inopportune time... They can also be intentionally released, but have no affection for whoever owns them.  
* Candle of Joy – “Exposing those who travel unseen – a light in the darkness”. When lit, this candle will sail into the air and explode, sending beautiful glitter and sparkles everywhere in a 10’ radius.  I also casts the spell as ‘Faerie fire’ in the area.  Make an atk roll to choose the target region within 60ft – on a miss, the candle will move 1D4 ‘5-foot squares’ in a random direction and still explodes.  On a critical miss, it explodes in your hand. (No boutique shop is without candles, afterall)
* Decorative Crockery – “Never want for your favorite beverage – ever again.” This mug, when filled for the first time will become an ‘Endless’ version of whatever non-magical liquid that is poured into it.  Afterward, they will produce up to 5 gallons of that liquid per day.  Some of them look like stone coffee cups, some of them look like Beer steins.  All of them have a bit of silver filagree and a definitive ‘elvish’ look to them. 
* Nutmeg & Saffron coated Cheese Curds – each on of these cheddar-looking morsels act as the druid spell ‘Goodberry’.
* Fudge – White or Brown – “A decadent treat to make you more effective”. The white fudge restores 1D4 Ki points.  The Brown fudge restores 1D4 Sorcerer points. Or if you are neither of those classes, you gain 5HP and obtain a ‘Bardic Inspiration’
* Sasparilla – “A caramel-flavored fizzy drink for improving health and restoring life – with a twist!”. This is a beautiful rendition of a ‘Greater Healing Potion’ – but with a delicious foamy finish.  Also produces a roll on the ‘Wild Magic Table’. 
* Fresh-baked bread – “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day – for everyone”. More like a fruit-cake consistency, this bread casts the spell ‘Conjure Food and Drink’.  Eating the food is glamourous, giving you advantage on intimidation or persuasion checks for 1 hour – and makes your hair glow.
* Baked Candied Apples – “Not for eating – but for removing those you dislike from your life”. When eaten, these will cast the ‘sleep’ spell on whoever eats it – and it lasts until ‘True Loves Kiss’ is administered.  The person is also ‘stabilized’ if dead and their body becomes invulnerable and immune to aging effects.  Alternatively, if sliced, the juice of this apple can be applied to up to 5 pieces of ammunition, causing it to ‘Stun’ the target on Hit (lasting until their next turn) unless they pass a DC13 Constitution check.  Don’t get the juice on your hands… (DC 15 or fall asleep for 1D8 hours.) This preparation takes 3D6 seconds for application.  Comes in a beautiful decorative ivory box shaped like a coffin
* Pineapple Gumballs – “For the friends of spell slingers, tree huggers, and deific hogwashers”. Firearm or slingshot ammunition +2 that removes 1D6 levels of spell slot from the target (on hit) and instills it in the gumball.  Eating the gumball will then restore than many levels of spell slot.  (Tastes strangely like ‘pine sap and apples’)
* Hot Cinnamon Cider – “Use on those that you want to love you”. A permanent love potion, working on the first person seen (of appropriate desire by the individual -blah blah blah)
* Give a Penny, Take a Penny – Give me a secret, or tell me a story, and I’ll answer a question.  (Whatever you ‘give’ is extracted from your head and bottled.  You no longer remember the secret, or the story)  The PC can then ask a question about anything... and Madame will answer to the best of her ability... she does seem to know qhite a bit of esoteric lore and happily provides info about fey. 
* “Give me a laugh” – if the PCs are unwilling to part with any of their magic items, they can tell her a joke, and the PC loses the ability to laugh (WIS Save of 20) – but she does gives you a warm baked good, and a 'leg hug' to make you feel better, booping your nose.... which, upon reflection, seems impossible since the woman is only 4' tall... weird... 

**Background** \- Madame PomFree is actually a hag, and 'lives off' the misery of the slum that surrounds her.  The shop is under a particular illusion where only customers looking for magical items to buy/sell can see it.  She is actually attempting to 'turn a corner' in her life by opening the shop and genuinely desires to help the party.  She doesn't want to hurt people, but also realizes that her visceral nature does require sadness and sorrow (without it, hags are like fish out of water, they die slowly...)   

**NPC Utility for DMs** \- I am a DM that often gives away 'too many magical items'.  When I realize this, and the group needs specific equipment, a DM can use Madame PomFree to trade some items for information or in exchange for her 'single use' magic baked goods.  Her prices are highly variable, so custom requests for equipment can require several other magical items.  If not otherwise noted, all baked goods 'go bad' after 1D4 days and cease to function.  Food doesn't last forever... Also, I provide cards for magic items to my players and write 'on the back' what the unknown effects might be.  Then place a post-it-note over the text to hide it until consumed.  For example, the bread upon identification will note the spell cast - but might not mention the fact that your hair glows until consumed.  This makes these discoveries sortof like 'Christmas morning', the PC 'needs to know' what happens - but the intended effects are mostly unharmful.  ",1,1736963495.0,dndnext,0,1.0,False

1i236kr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i236kr,Help with layout/design of living and dining room,"I am struggling with the layout and interior decorating of my living room space. I’m including the dining room in this as well since it’s all open concept with (half of) the living room.

The living room in general is long and narrow and broken up by an open wall on one side (that leads to the dining room) and the front door in the other side. 

I know tv above the fireplace is bad and I really don’t like it, but there’s just no where else to put it. It could go in front of the windows (on the left of the door) and move the couch to the long wall, but I don’t love that either. 

I am open to getting a different couch, maybe an L shape would be better? We had this couch in our old place and it worked a lot better because it floated (rather than being anchored). I can’t have it float in its current position because then it’s too close to the front door and I can’t move it forward (to clear the door) because then it’s too close to the tv. 

I also don’t know what to do with the other half of the living room. It’s sort of like a parlor area but I’ve tried a million configurations of it (table in the middle in front of window, record player where cat tree is, etc.) and nothing seems to work. 

Any decorating ideas are also welcome - I hate the big painting on the wall above the couch, but I don’t know what else to put there (the wall is sooo long). Which is why I got the arching lamp to help break it up. I also don’t like the rug in the living room and I think the round wood coffee table might not work, but I can’t tell.

1i232dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1i232dg/update_my_38m_fiancee_31f_has_let_an_ex_sexual/,Update: My (38m) fiancee (31f) has let an ex sexual partner back in her life and its causing a lot of friction since she got pregnant ,"**UPDATE:**

We took the paternity test, that was an awkward request to make in a hospital consultation room during a ultrasound scan. The child belongs to me. I don't really know how to describe how I feel, it's not really relief, I didn't truly believe my fiancee would get pregnant to another man and hide it from me. If anything I feel like an insecure fool.

Me and my wife had another long talk after the letter came through. She understands my feelings better, I understand her feelings better. A lot of people brought up how this has nothing to do with our sexual pasts and I couldn't agree with that, I think I've always had some pent up insecurity from my sexual inexperience which influences my thought process. I don't understand my wife's past as much as I try too and openly want too almost as coping method.

Sex is just a special thing to me that I can't fathom 2 people not being forever emotionally changed by it. My wife suggested that as a teen sleeping with 2 guys at the same time and knocking back offers from a 3rd makes it not as crucial a life experience. The 3rd party in question I know is't exactly short of sexual experience. I know him well enough to name at least 10 women he'd slept with, amusingly 2 of them turned into lesbians. I know the timeline well enough that roughly the time they started sleeping together he had just broken up with an ex of his. It makes sense to me. In a way I'm almost a bit jealous I didn't have that experience as a young man. I hope thats not horrible to admit. Something about the thought of a raw sexual fulfillment without commitment is so alien to someone who dated their wife for 5 months before having sex with them.

Certain things didn't add up, if she had got pregnant to him in August, why was she only deceitful about visiting his place in December. Why did she want to visit his anyway even though I asked her not too, well I work from home so she never really gets time to herself so visiting a friends for a coffee while picking up groceries was a chance for her to get some time out the house and seeing friends before: oh yeah -we have an infant to take care of. Heck, one of the times she was visiting, she was picking up a separate female friend who needed a lift back home and she thought she'd introduce them to see if she could hook them up. Its not like she didn't know I couldn't look at her timeline as we both use that stuff regularly to reminisce about old trips etc. She wasn't outright lying, she just didn't want to be open because she didn't realize how much my thoughts affected me.

So yeah, I feel positive about how open its forced me and my wife to be, even through some really uncomfortable but open conversations. She said she's not going to make any efforts to see him socially but if she's asked will meet for a coffee at starbucks etc. In fact its his birthday at the end of the month and that will mark the 14th year anniversary of me meeting my wife as I said in my earlier post - I met my wife through this guy at his birthday party.

I never disliked the guy in question, that's the thing that makes me feel like such a fool. We have similar interests (clearly, lol), I didn't mention that the last time I saw him was at a pub in September. I'll be honest, in retrospect I didn't get the vibe he was fucking my woman behind my back, i even recall him saying ""good to see you, thanks for coming out, don't see you often these days"".

Look there are ways I probably wrote my initial post that tried to make me look like the protagonist, I didn't mention that I barely leave the house so my wife really doesn't get any ""away"" time. I didn't mention that I smoke a chronic amount of marijuana which might influence the patterns I see. I didn't mention that her biggest annoyance with me is I don't really like going out and would say in the house 7 days a week whereas she loves going out and socializing etc.

Whats most important in all of this stupid human made drama is that we now have a beautiful baby boy to look forward to. Hey guess what guys, turns out if your wife loses 4 stone/25kg/55lbs and you rawdog her twice a day for 4 months, there is a good chance nature will get its way. :)

**TL;DR** \- my pregnant partner has been seeing an ex and not being honest about it

I'll start with the basic big facts - I was a virgin till i met my current partner, we were 25 and 18 when we met, we've been together for 13 years, our first child is due next spring, we've never had any real friction in our relationship till now.

About 3 months ago my partner reconciled with an ex fuck buddy of hers, they met at a local festival, they've been friends throughout our relationship and we actually met directly through him but we had moved away to a nearby city so we don't see him often. I know the details of their relationship because I inquired early on. Before I was in her life they were seemingly sexually quite close, sleeping over, sex in the kitchen during a party, etc. They broke it up because well, I don't really know, like I say I can only describe it as a fuck buddy situation, something I've never been part of.

When I say fuck buddy I want to be clear my wife was 16 or 17 at the time, had just moved out of her mums house and was having a fun time of it. She was sleeping with another guy at the time and she maintains to this day she was ""never in a relationship"" with him.

My wife and I have struggled with intimacy throughout her pregnancy, she had one big scare with a blood clot and otherwise feels uninterested. We've had sex 3 times since finding out in September, I've struggled with the lack of sex. It starts making your mind wonder.

About 2 months ago I found out she'd been round at his having a coffee while she was in the city doing grocery shopping, that in combination with seeing a text message on her phone to him saying ""have a nice day at work, xx"" kinda set me off. I told her I was really uncomfortable with her continuing a relationship with him. We had a big argument, I said to her I'm not going to hold her hostage, if she sees him out at the pub you don't have to flat out ignore him but just please don't meet him 1 on 1 in private as that feels very disrespectful.

About 2 weeks ago, my fiancee said she was going out to the shops, I could tell by her body language and her manner of speaking that something didn't seem quite right so I let it sit for 2 days, when she was out at work 2 days later, I checked her google timelines and saw she'd been at his address the week before and also that day she was out shopping.

I confronted her, I explained that this was a huge violation of respect, and that if it wasn't for the baby on the way that I would flat out end the relationship. She said she was sorry and it'll be a burden for the rest of her life and she won't see him again in any context if it affects me this much. I said I feel horrible restricting her like that but she can't fathom how different our sexual experiences are and the thought of even talking to someone you slept with, much less maintaining a civil platonic friendship is baffling to me.

Oh yeah the kicker, she got pregnant around about the same time she bumped into her fuck buddy. My wife and I have been trying for a baby for around 3 years with no success, and to be fair she has lost 4 stone this year. I want to believe that's what caused the fertility to kick in.

Obviously I want to take a paternity test as much as I trust my wife didn't have sex with me to get pregnant to another man, it's going to play on my mind. The whole thing has for the past 2 weeks. She's admitted that what she was doing was something of an emotional affair and has brought up my lack of attention towards her in recent months as part of her lack of fulfillment. My wife and I feel closer through this, its forced us to talk about some uncomfortable subjects but overall I feel deflated and empty.

Am I going to be able to live with this lack of trust and get over it, how reasonable am I being in my response to my partners actions? This has consumed my thoughts for the past 2 weeks so I just need something to relate too. Thank you",5,1736963072.0,amiwrong,21,0.67,False

I mean, I know it's all part of the process, but come on - how many ways can you describe a character walking into a room? 

I've got notes and scraps of paper everywhere, and my coffee mug is still sitting on my desk from this morning. I think I've single-handedly kept the coffee industry afloat for the past week. My family is starting to think I've abandoned them for the world of fictional characters, and honestly, they're not wrong.

But despite all the frustration and caffeine-fueled madness, I had this one moment where everything just clicked. The dialogue flowed, the pacing felt right, and I actually felt like I was getting somewhere. It was like the writing gods decided to smile down on me and say, ""Hey, you're not completely terrible at this.""

Has anyone else ever had one of those moments where it all comes together, and you're like, ""Yes, this is why I'm doing this""?

I am on 60mg of Vyvanse once a day and have been on this dose for about two years. I notice that after about 1 hour of having taken my dose I start yawning like crazy. This occurs throughout the day and I feel so tired. I have to drink a cup of coffee daily in the late morning or late afternoon to feel awake. I also take it on an empty stomach or sometimes with food and I feel it does not make a difference. My psychiatrist says that it could be because it is wearing off or that it is doing its job by calming me down. Is anyone else experiencing yawning and tiredness?

Alright - so let's connect. I'm open to talking to girls or guys 25 years old +

Please leave at least 2-3 sentences about yourself or something thoughtful in your response.

I'll try to keep mine engaging.

So, I'm a Math Tutor and would love to be like my Uni Calc Professor. She's a Goddess. Her notes were so structured and she made class fun and friendly.

I'm learning to play the guitar these days using the app Yousician. I finished Stage 1. There are a total of 10 stages.

I love driving downtown and going on road trips with friends. I love it when streets are extremely narrow and traffic is packed because I thrive when it comes to driving skills.

Coffee addict lol. The Office. Modern Family. Trailer Park Boys. Friends. Big Bang Theory. Superstore, Parks and Rec, Brooklyn-99.

Been COD since MW2 with the sexy UMP45. I love dead ops arcade (zombie survival game). But me and my friends are so good the game would last 4+ days so it's hard to find time to get with the squad.

I'm trying to learn programming (Python, Java, HTML, Swift). But it seems like the Software Era is on steroids.

I love to help people. That's just who I am. I especially want to help 1st year and Grade 12 students with uni advice etc.

So, not sure how to put a ribbon on all this introduction. But people would describe me as quiet, kind, patient, soft spoken, gentle, supportive..... I spend a lot of time reflecting and also looking into Psychology.

I believe I'm a good writer (if I am writing using my strengths)

I try making YouTube content here and there. Like a timelapse of me cleaning stuff.

I've grown to dislike this word. I don't believe or ''feel'' disciplined. Discipline is not what Youtubers might tell you.

You'd imagine that ''just doing things when they need to be done'' is discipline. But that's not true at all. It's actually the opposite. It's not about getting ''tougher''. It's about feeling less strain per activity.

So for example, in 2010 I was dealing with depression and it took me more effort to get out of bed than for me to do a 90 minute work out session in 2025. So it's not that I am better at ''sucking up the pain of discomfort''. It is that it now requires little to no strain for me to do the things I need to do because I've grown into it.

**How did I solve it?**

This answer is luckily the same and I can't stress enough how true this is. It's two-fold. 1: Don't compare yourself to others, but only to who you were yesterday.

Halfway between wild and urban. Opulent and shabby. Mansions and crack dens. Beachfront and deep swamp. You don't realize how rich some people are until you drive through some of these subdivisions in Naples. All that money, and unless you're a talented bartender, it doesn't quite trickle down, especially in September. In Florida, our only two seasons are hurricane and tourist. So, a few months ago, when the market decided to take a shit, I decided it was time to find a second job. 

""Isaiah Combs 8-10 Live"" An A-frame blackboard sign read outside the only barren bar on the bustled street. I lugged in my PA, eyes darting from the marble bar top, bleach-white walls, and in stark contrast to the more fashionable nature of the rest of the bar; metal signs, with messages printed reading ""If you ain't fallen over yet you need another beer!"" and ""If beer isn't the answer you're asking the wrong question!"" that would be more at home in your boomer uncle's man cave that he fully furnished with Temu and Hobby Lobby. 4 or 5 years ago someone cared about this place. Had an elegant vision of a locale with all the class of a 5-star hotel lobby bar. That was until a new owner or manager, what have you, said to themself ""This is not what bar look like! Bar have pool table and dart board!""

My eyes met the bartender's and I saw the look in his eye before I saw him. He didn't want to be here as much as I did. He couldn't be much older than me, late-20s black button-down with a black tie. I wasn't sure if my polo was out of place yet.

""Can I help you with something, man?"" He had an accent to his voice I couldn't place outside of being European. 

""Yeah, I'm Isaiah, I'm playing here tonight. Liza didn't tell me where she wanted me to set up over the phone."" 

The bartender gestured to the vacant floor space in front of the touchtune, next to an ornate vintage wine cabinet. I bent my knees and carried my speakers to their destination. I could see a line on the floor where the linoleum was faded. Separated only by the black gunk from where a runner rug used to be duct tapped down and no one thought it would be a good idea to spray some goo gone before the tracks of months to years worth of patrons made it a permanent fixture of this hodgepodge. 

I'm starting to not quite care for this place. The bar or the city you take your pick. I finished setting up in record time as there were no drunks giving me the ""I'm gonna shout free bird as loud as I fucking can in about 10 to 15 minutes"" stare. No drunks or anyone for that matter. Just me and Bartender, he told me his name but for the life of me, I couldn't piece together the noise he made in a way that made sense phonetically. 

I jammed there by myself for an hour, an old man shuffled in looking for the bathroom. My tip jar remained as dry as a flood-controlled swamp. The calloused skin on my fingers flaked off with each successful chord change. The clock drudged forward getting closer to 10 pm. By this time a regular was seated at the far end of the bar away from me. I rigged up my harp rack with a G Harmonica to play Seminole Wind. 


When I was a little kid my dad used to take me on expeditions out in the Everglades. He had this story he told me about the skunk ape, basically South Florida's version of Bigfoot. I ate that shit up. We would pack a sack with bologna and cheese sandwiches, deep woods Off with 40% DEET, flashlights, binoculars, fishing gear, and the whole nine yards to go spend the day cavorting out in the swamp searching for signs of the elusive creature. The 2001 Saturn Vue hit Alligator Alley like Magellan on the high sea. Uncharted paved territory as waves of yellow, orange, and pink strobed between the trees in the early hours of daylight. The summer heat cascaded over our skin as we sat, getting eaten alive by mosquitoes, under a Cyprus tree enjoying our lunch that day. We never had any luck, I'm still hopeful there's stuff like that out there though. I've always had a fascination with the strange but I'm rational. I know there's likely no Bigfoot, skinwalkers, or most cryptids. And if there are any out there then it's just a part of nature we haven't found yet. Nothing really supernatural about it. 

That doesn't stop me from being cautious when going out on trails though.


My phone rang. It was Harvey. He was the one who got me this shit gig, hey at least I would walk home with two hundred and fifty bucks. Harvey had recently been promoted to good friend after spending quite some time in the acquaintance-zone. Everyone has quirks and flaws but sometimes, Harvey was a bit to stomach.

""Yooo big dog!"" Harvey called out from my phone, ""How's the Hideout? Makin' stacks?""

""Not particularly, there's one dude here and he hasn't taken an eye off his beer since he sat down like 10 minutes ago."" I leaned against the wall separating the out-of-order men's room and ladies' room as my iPad ran the show.

""Mannn, that sucksss dude. If I'm gonna be honest I do not like Liza. Bitch vibes.""

""Yeah, I don't know dude,"" I remembered the old guy from earlier and wondered if he used the women's restroom.

""Oh bro bro, before I forget. You're still looking for something steady right?""

Harvey was about to save my ass again. ""Dude, I'm always looking, what do ya got?""

""Okay, so my uncle's friend or something right, he was chilling and told me he needed some extra help at some wildlife sanctuary or nature trail type shit.""

""What type of work?""

""Bro bro bro, it's nothing. It's a big animal research center in the middle of fucking nowhere and they just need a guy.""

""A guy to do what?""

""Men shit. Watch the place, pick up heavy things when they got em. Like security and stuff mostly.""

""This place is just in the middle of woods somewhere?""

""Yeah bro, security on that place is easy money dog. Deep out in Fakahatchee or Picayune I think. There's no one for miles, you just gonna be on the radio like 'uuhh there's a bear, and nothing else' and that's a band.""

The man on the other end of the bar began a coughing fit. The bartender didn't so much as look up from his phone. I squinted through the dimly lit bipolarly decorated room to see he was wearing AirPods.

""Harvey, text me your uncle's cousin's roommate's number please.""

""Type shit. Let me know if Liza gives you shit tonight, she stiffed me last week.""


Monday afternoon I drove out to the Gore Research Center. This place was in the boonies. There's a funny thing about Florida. It's similar to how the rest of the country is, just shrunk down and set the dial from low to high. Most of the people are on the coast and that's where all the money is. But you drive like 25 minutes and might as well be in Louisiana. I live about 10 minutes from one of the Bidens and another 20 minutes from there my dad found an upturned skiff housing a bale of marijuana. I didn't know they came in bales. Word of the wise, never try to stab one of those thinking you might just take a little bit. Those things are super compact. They had prison crews cleaning up for a couple of days.

I had been driving to meet the woman in charge of the facility for about 30 minutes now. Sedan was not the vehicle for the job. It hadn't rained in about four days which was uncommon that time of year, that was in my favor. I turned right off Golden Gate Parkway to head deep into the Picayune Strand State Forest. Traffic slowly waned as the roads fell into disrepair. Homes that scattered the county road became less and less common. Less and less kept. American flags turn to Trump flags. Trump flags turn to rebel flags. Rebel flags turn to trees. 

After a few miles passed, I came upon a road sign. 

""End County Maintenance.""  

Thud. The car lurched from the asphalt to the cruel limestone sand and dirt, throwing a cloud behind me as I vibrated down the landscape.

A majority of the journey had become unpaved. I had never been out that way. There's an almost unending maze of lefts and rights out there. RV's parked out in the middle of clearings, doing God knows what, strange wooden encampment suspended between the trees. I passed a dead deer around 130th Ave. 


I pulled up to the gate about two hours before sunset. My battle-weary Hyundai splattered with mud, dirt, and grime idled waiting for the gate to open.

I checked my messages with the contact I was given. Not delivered. I had one bar of LTE this far out which honestly surprised me. I sent a new message informing her I was outside. In wait, I took stock of my surroundings. 3 Signs on a post reading:

""No Trespassers KEEP OUT""

""Naithloriendum Wildlife Sanctuary""

And the third, ""Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time? Ecclesiastes 7:17""


It was only a few moments before the front gate roared into life. 
The house was something out of Swiss Family Robinson. Towering on all sides were live oaks, Cyprus, and ficus trees. The unkempt driveway led to a winding staircase encroached on by a strangler fig. Jasmine vines climbed the banister on the front porch up to the second floor, its wilted white flowers speckled on the duff. Spanish moss covered the trees and shrouded the home drawing the eye to an observation deck on what looked to be the third floor. It was as if nature was reclaiming what was once hers.

She must've been in her early 60's. The gray roots just creeping up from her tightly packed jet-black hair. ""Isaiah, so good to see you!"" She called out from the front door. Her voice was much louder than you'd expect for the distance between us. I had to match the energy, ""Deb! Nice to finally meet in person!""

Feeling some sort of need to take control of this altogether new setting I found myself in, I quickly closed the distance between her and I. Scaling the derelict staircase with a hand outstretched. My enthusiasm, to me, felt outside the bounds of societal convention. The gentle breeze against my palm, as I swung it ahead, made it all too clear that clammy beads of sweat had formed. 

""Come in son, I'll let you get your bearings."" Deb showed me inside an immaculately clean house. House is the wrong word. It was unlived in. No utilitarian furnishings like TVs or kitchen appliances outside of a coffee maker seated on the welcome desk. Above the desk, there was a portrait of a smiling white-haired, bearded old man, with a golden retriever, seated on the front step of the old staircase. Before the strangler fig made its debut.

Deb tossed her jean jacket onto a coat rack by the front door and turned towards me clasping her hands together and teetering from heel to toe. ""Well! Welcome to the education center. This is, of course, Dr.Bob's former home. We do tours, and craft days, and uh the occasional field trip. Well. Unoccasional. It's a bit- just a bit far and obscure and too much of a negative connotation for the schools you know. Anyway! That doesn't stop any of the great work we do!"" Deb's eyes lit up at this. 

""So this is a uh conservation collier restoration site. Basically we are working to uh return this area to its natural habitat. This is a Cyprus hardwood, damn no it's a uh, hardwood, Cyprus, swamp, forest. Hardwood Cyprus swamp forest. While being both in the Picayune Strand we are also smack dab in the middle of uh Big Cyprus's Critical Area of State Concern."" Deb made her way to the rear of the house, passing photographs and newspapers strewn along the wall captioned like it would be at a museum.

""We work to create awareness and of course have boots on the ground here"" She spun to look at me. ""During the day."" She spun back. ""We document tree growth, panther population, water quality, you name it. The further people are from these uh vital environments the more they tend to do well. Flourish.""

We crossed a corridor, sealed by a red velvet rope and two greening, once golden stations. I peered inside seeing one of those wheeled stepladders you see in old libraries. I adjusted my gaze back toward her, ""Keep Florida wild!"" I chimed in.

""Exactly! Yes, that's so good. I like that.""

I felt bad that I was just repeating some Instagram caption I had seen. We both stood there for a moment. I just smiled and nodded through the silence.

""OH,"" she exclaimed, clapping her hands together once more. ""W-9 and stuff I'll drop by when I um come to meet you in the morning. Let me show you a little bit around here now."" An about-face towards the front door.

""This was Robert's entertaining area. It was used only by him though. Little to no visitors, those who knew him described him as a bit of a curmudgeon."" She led me to the front reception, and again I saw posted above the door the word ""Naithlorendum""

I grabbed my phone from my pocket to google it. Just as we're rounding the desk to  climb up a second-story staircase Deb interrupts.""Most of what you will need you can find in or under here. Including a charger."" She grabbed the lightning cable and handed it to me. ""Thanks""

""Ab-so-lutly! Now follow me up here and I'll show you some of the exhibits."" As Deb grabbed the guard rail to the staircase she knocked on it three times. We ascended and the age of this building began to show, the air got more still and I could smell the faint nostalgic aroma of mildew. The musty air swirled in vapors as Deb reached for a brittle yellowed light switch at the top of the stairs. ""Click"" 

Nothing.

""This damn-"" She flicked it on and off three times and the overhead fluorescents buzzed, spattered, and awoke with all the vigor of a model T. A taxidermied bear, a few wild boar, a buck and a doe, a bald eagle, gopher tortoises, and a few otters in a menagerie of nature frozen in death. The wall to the left had a nearly 6-foot-long tarpon. 

Deb pointed to the bald eagle ""Don't worry, that's incredibly old."" She must've misinterpreted the bewildered look on my face for concern. Deb went on to explain some of the origins of the animals, or fun facts, or something while I took steps to mentally document my surroundings. Further on into the upstairs, there was a door. Plain wooden door with a black painted profile of a wild hog. I made my approach.

""That's the Pig Room.""

Instinctively I almost blurted out ""The fuck?"" But I caught myself when I turned and faced this short kind-eyed woman who just so happened to be my new boss.

""Pardon""

""The Pig Room""

""Is that-""

""Exactly what you think it is? Yes""

Well, fucking thank you, Deb. I have not a clue in the world what the hell that means. She misread my expression again. She charged forward and opened the door. 

Frankly, there isn't anything I would have called it outside of the Pig Room. Speckled shadows crept through the doorway. A curtained window obscured by the mess of jasmine outside was the only light source. Deb trodded to the center of the room and pulled a cord. Illuminated now was a man's life's work. Glass cases and dioramas. Jars and diagrams. Sketches, notes, photographs, and all dedicated to the pigs. 

There was an old padauk wood bookcase brimmed with a dozen or more jars of fetal pigs suspended in formaldehyde. On another shelf, there were books like ""The Merck Veterinary Manual Eleventh Edition"" bound in navy canvas with silver foil lettering. Another read “The Embryology of  The Pig Second Edition,” with a maroon cover and gold foil emboss. The other shelves were dotted with body parts, trinkets and journals; including a crate filled with 30 to 40 boar tusks. Tacked to the wall was a photocopy of a textbook that read ""Chapter 7 The Structure of Embryos from Nine to Twelve Millimeters in Length,"" on the second page was a diagram of a curled and squashed mass. Little slits for eyes, its shape that of a manatee more than a pig. The center of the room was a stainless steel table. It slanted off slightly towards the opposite wall into a drain. A small trough lined the table, inside were medical instruments like scalpels a bone saw, and other things I didn't recognize. On the other end of the room was a meticulously constructed display, a paper-thin slice of a pig under glass. There were 6 in all,  the same size but different areas of the body. White cartilage encased in meat around the thing's snout, and a cavity with a perfectly round white mass. Organs and bones were perfectly preserved in place and time like some 4th-dimensional creature had trapped the hog there then and now.

I ran my hand along the trough of the operation table, its cool surface had seen years of scratches and wearing. 

I turned my head and caught a glimpse of the cages. Eight separate cages empty of tenants, but exuded an energy of melancholy. Old dusty stained hay and straw lie on the ground of each cell which were only about 2 and a half feet in width and 5 feet deep. The room had no distinct scent.

""Bob took his research very seriously,"" Yeah no shit Deb, I don't think they sell pig slices on Amazon. ""The advancements made in veterinary medicine by Bob are astounding really.""

I took stock of the shelves, textbooks, and general macabre set. ""Well, I can say this is not exactly what I was expecting.""

Deb huffed and shrugged. Knocking on the door three times as she exited and turned towards the next floor up. 


Once completing our tour I followed my boss out to the driveway. 

""I'll be back in the morning around 8 to get the report of the night. There's usually as you'd likely expect not too much activity. If you get bored I have filing in Bob's downstairs study that has to be done. There's a cru de ta platter in the uh break room fridge I think.""

""Thank you, Deb, I really appreciate this opportunity.""

""Ab-so-lutly Isaiah. Don't let the isolation get to you now.""

With that she twirled her keys, clicking the unlock thrice. She clambered up into her dark green Jeep Wrangler and kicked a dust cloud behind her as she left. I strolled out after her seeing her car grow smaller until turning off Desoto back towards civilization. The machines roar waning and waning until… silence.

I took a right turn down 40th Avenue and spotted a sign not too far off. ""Dr.Robert H. Gore III Preserve""

""Hell yeah,"" I instinctively muttered. My sneakers made the satisfying gravel on-sole crunch as I lightly jogged to the trailhead. Twilight had just begun to set in when I rounded the 2-mile loop sign. The forest greets me with an ospreys coo overhead, no other sounds but the gentle breeze swaying between leaves needles, and palmetto branches. The occasional snap and crack; sounds of the wilderness my brain was once so accustomed to. I started a hike on my Apple Watch. My legs needed a stretch after that tumultuous ride, and my mind needed a stretch after the interview, if you could call it that, with Deb. What did she mean by ""don't let the isolation get to you?"" 

I realized after an indeterminate amount of time walking I hadn't been paying close attention to my surroundings. A mossy oak entwined with a sable palm to my right engrossed by vegetation. To my left numerous old Florida pines. Some were full of life, others rotting and brimming with woodpecker burrows. To my front, a narrowing path of toppled palms. To my back, rapidly dwindling daylight.

I had to pick up my pace. 

The more obscured view had made the more treacherous terrain more treacherous. The once smoothly mowed path was now dotted with rocks, branches, and root systems climbing into the overworld. The taller grass made little foot-sized holes vague and unclear. As I made my attempt to bound as quickly and safely as I could through the forest, every squeak, every bird call, every flutter of wings got louder. A branch caught my arm, breaking skin and spilling first blood.  As the evening's light drew closer to the Earth it made the bird's shadows above appear like Thunderbirds in a cat 5. Branches made to be the arms and claws of Mother Nature herself, snatching me back to dust. I reached into my pocket for my phone. I had left it on the front desk. 

I didn't have a flashlight.

I stopped dead in my tracks. The pit that had formed in the back of my throat from breathing in the cold Florida air dropped down into my chest. Decision-making hindered. I picked up the pace. 

I've hiked at night before, technically speaking, but that trail is 714 feet long. You can map it with your eyes closed. In all new territory, while technically on the clock, I've gotten myself much deeper than I had hoped. I'm not lost. The trail is just a loop; there's only one way in and the same way out. Or so I thought. I rounded the corner and there was a dead end. Surrounded by nothing but a thicket of vegetation and densely packed palmettos. I still wasn't lost. I could just turn around and go the same way I came. The orange-colored sky had fully desaturated and turned to an inky black. I bounded down the trail through the night with wanton disregard for the stones and roots that lay in my path. I had to get out of here as soon as possible. Palmetto branches brushed my shoulders. The deep sounds of my footfalls were only drowned out by my huffing and puffing. 

My left foot wedged itself underneath a root. As soon as I realized what was happening, I had already hit the ground. The little panicked breaths that had filled my lungs all rushed out in a single moment as my chest became well acquainted with the forest floor. My left hand scuffed against dirt and leaves, and my right palm grazed the surface of a moss-covered stone. If there was any air left in my lungs, I would have laughed at myself. That is until I realized my footsteps continued after I fell.

Call it delirium, call it adrenaline, but I could've sworn that as I was falling I could hear footsteps continuing in my pace. My cheek lying on the ground and eyesight serving me no good, I became intensely aware of the sounds and smells in my immediate vicinity. 

I heard nothing. No birds. No rodents. No twigs snapping. No rustling critters in the brush. Just the gentle breeze, whistling through the Palmetto branches and leaves. If only for a second the area reeked of ammonia and urine. A subtle presence of rotting fruit and eggs filled the air. Through the aches, and the pains I all of a sudden had the feeling like I was being watched. Like all at once, a colony of eyes transfixed on my crumpled heap. 

Fear froze me there in time. ""If it's black: fight back, if it's brown: lie down."" There aren't any brown bears in Florida as far as I know, so this is gonna have to be a fighting-back scenario. Unless the rules change if you're already lying down. There's only one way out of here and it's forward and if there is something in here it's behind me so I've got that going.

""Plink"" 

""What the hell was that,"" I thought to myself. 

""Plink""

It was closer this time. It sounded like something had fallen about three or 4 feet from my head.

""Plink""

""Shit,"" I instinctively muttered, breaking the unspoken rule of silence the forest had set upon me. I could see it now, a rock. A tiny little rock must have just landed right in front of my face.

""Plink""

I think something just lobbed a rock past my head.

The pain in my body all at once became the lowest priority I had. I pushed against the limestone and dirt, jolting my body upright. I spun to look for what lay in wait just behind my back.

Nothing.

No way in hell I was about to wait for whatever it was to show itself. Heart and mind racing at breakneck speed, my feet matched their tempo. I expertly dashed through the remaining trail. Rocks, holes, and branches were becoming more and more sparse. The back lip of my shoes ripped and tore at my Achilles tendon. My heart pounded and pounded until it felt like it was about to wriggle its way through my ribs and fall out. My lungs heaved air rapidly, the speed exasperated by the tremendous effort engaged by both my legs and amygdala. I could hear more footsteps than mine. I was being pursued. Instinct took over. Adrenaline guided my path and my conscious mind fell into complete blindness. I was no longer human. I was prey. I emerged at the trailhead moments later and it all flooded back. I peeked over my shoulder as I hit the road and ran back towards Naithlorendum. My pursuers had remained on the trail.

I scaled the strangled staircase and slammed the door behind me. The silence of the space was absolutely deafening. I leaned against the door and followed it down to the floor. I lay there for a short time. 

My mind flickered and adjusted back to reality. Fear had gripped each muscle fiber and tendon in my body. Reason began to administer its soothing medicine of denial.

The air was still, and frigid. I started to recognize some things not made all too clear by Deb. There's no air conditioning in this house. How does a house in the middle of Florida not have central heating and air? I went to the downstairs restroom to survey the damage. 
My palms were red and sore but altogether fine. I was covered in dirt and leaves, and there were a few deep scratches on my left cheek. I looked like hell but otherwise all right. I started running the sink so I could clean the cuts. I shook the dirt off my clothes into the bathtub. I winced taking off my left sneaker. I've never broken a toe before, but I know they're not supposed to be purple. 

I met my gaze in the mirror. "" What the hell was that?"" I folded up a sheet of toilet paper and dabbed cold water around the cuts that would distract from the dark circles under my eyes. I was tired, maybe even overtired.

""Was there anything there at all?"" A voice rose from the back of my head.

""No, no! I know what I saw.""

""What did you see?""

I couldn't answer that part of myself. I didn't actually see anything. But I knew what I heard.

""But what did you hear?""

Footsteps, the rock. I could—

""Rationally explain everything?""

The forest was dark, my adrenaline was pumping, and my mind could've been playing tricks on me. A coyote or less agreeably a panther could be a logical explanation. Any explanation though required too much mental gymnastics to make sense. My brain was already stiff and rigid and exercise was the last thing it needed. 

I would have gone out to my car to get my guitar to get my mind on something else, but there's a better chance of finding the winning lottery ticket in a haystack while being struck by lightning in a frozen-over Hell than me going back out there any time soon. I plopped onto the couch in front of the massive limestone fireplace. I needed to rest my eyes for a moment. Every blink fell heavier and heavier. The day's troubles exchanged the weight held by my heart to the eyelids.

I was out for 5 minutes. 

For the next hour, I explored the interior of my new job site. If the Pig Room was anything to go off of, there had to be more than what meets the eye. Dr.Gore was an established author and I found a few of his books in his study. Nothing on pigs. Aside from the swine's carnival of terrors placed directly over my head nothing seemed out of the ordinary. This tiny museum, a display of a man's life and passion, deep out in the sticks about 20 miles east of nowhere. What was the point of it all? Why keep it standing and open for visitors? These questions swirled in my psyche until one thought elbowed its way through the crowd and made itself a front-row seat in my mind.

""Why am I here?""

Tonight's wages would be the tipping point for me to afford health insurance this month, tomorrow's would pay for a week of meal kits. 
Not why I, personally, am here. Why would they have anyone here? What am I protecting and what am I protecting from? 

I'm just here to ""keep an eye on things"" right? This revelation bothered me as I mounted up to the very crest of the stairs and entered the cupola. As I paced circles around the observation deck another question had dispersed the crowd and made itself the only voice crying out in the wasteland of thought.

""Don't let the isolation get to you.""

Deb's final words to me were a harbinger of sorts. I limped up the stairs, purple-toed with an abrasion-littered face because I let it get to me. I was going mad. Paranoid. If I didn't have an immediate personality switch I wouldn't make it through the night.

""Plink.""

My blood ran cold. My temples pounded like a pair of timpani in a ritardando as my peripheral vision tightened down to a single point. Frozen in space and time, I waited for more noise. Five agonizingly slow minutes pass. I was surrounded on all sides by glass and on the other side of the glass nothing but the Spanish moss and darkness. A steady overcast of cumulonimbus had drowned the stars and dim crescent moonlight. Wind howled through the trees in a mighty crescendo until: ""plink.""
There is no way I imagined it because I saw it this time. I saw a pebble hit the window. I staggered back and became instantly aware of the fishbowl I had myself in. I decided the windowless room of the downstairs study would be safe, so I carefully climbed down the stairs. The soulless visage of the taxidermy bear shot me daggers as I made it to the second floor. I avoided the animals not wanting to get close. 

It had gotten even colder downstairs, a draft that sent goosebumps across my body. Rounding the welcome desk I snatched my phone from the charger. It hadn't charged, in fact, it was down to 20%. 

The wind was getting louder as I put my hand on the golden stanchion. A yellow-aged newspaper clipping on the desk caught my eye.

""December 19, 2000

Homeowner Shoots at Alleged Trespasser's Vehicle, One Teen Dead.""

I heard a rattling noise from the back of the house. It sounded like a branch on hurricane shutters. I ignored the study and crept towards the back of Naithlorendum. The window was open.

As the wind swept through the house I knew I wasn't alone. I was waiting for that little part of me, that thought my pursuer in the forest was a hallucination, to apologize. 

I heard a clattering noise upstairs. Like something had just tripped on one of the taxidermy projects. 

Eggs, fruit, ammonia, and urine. The scent had filled the air like a noxious perfume. It had found me.

""I don't care how much I'm getting paid, I'm not staying here another minute,"" I muttered as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned onto Desoto to make the hour-long trek back to civilization and out of this God-forsaken wood. I pulled out my phone and sent a message to Deb. 

""shit went down tonight. I don't know WTF is going on up here but I want no part of it. front gate closed and door if locked, key under the mat. If you knew what I was getting into im very disappointed"" 

Not delivered. I had no service at all now. While it was on my mind I attempted to send a message to Harvey: 
""hey bro, who the hell told you about this gig at the nature center? there is some crazy shit up here""

The Hyundai's brights illuminated the street, a bright white tunnel through the towering Pines. Mud, dust, and dirt kicked up and splattered against my car's already abused frame. Even with no one on the road I maintained 35 miles an hour. The scarlet beacon of my tail light illuminated a solitary figure dart across the street behind me. It was a child.

At two in the morning, on a back county road, deep in an old Florida state forest, a four-foot-tall child just ran behind my car, narrowly avoiding death.

Normally I would stop, but the woods couldn't pull one over me like that. It had gotten me out here but nothing was going to stop me. Something could slow me down. You see, most January's in Florida get one total day of rainfall. Well, apparently tonight was day two.
The sky's levee had overflowed and a free fall of rain engulfed my vehicle. My vehicle, the trees, and more importantly the dirt road. The rough and rocky terrain ahead began to mold and shift. My tires cut grooves into the earth as water began to break up the loam.

With full focus and attention on my surroundings, the corner of my vision caught something in the rearview.

The child was chasing my car.

At an inhuman speed, the silhouette steadily sprinted through the slurry kicking up behind my back tires. My fingers fumbled to switch that puppy into sport mode. I slammed my foot to the gas pedal and lurched forward. Anything not tied down had slipped and fell towards the back seat as I pumped the accelerator and gripped the steering wheel. The bumps in the road amplified, I had consecutive but sporadic airtime. The wipers spit rain and mud to either side. I glanced in the rearview. 

The child was galloping on all fours. Unbothered by the speed, by the mud, by the rain. The thing persisted. Its appendages moving with such fervor, its head pointed to the ground, it followed. It was gaining on me. 

I passed the skeletal remains of a deer on 130th.

I gripped the steering wheel as tightly as I could when I felt it start to get away from me. I was too late. I hydroplaned and spun out of control. I careened off the muddied road and narrowly missed a pine as I sailed off into a field. As I involuntarily did donuts in the clearing my brakes had finally pushed my car to a complete stop.

The pitter-patter drone of rainfall atop the car was the only thing I heard as my wrist vibrated informing me I had just been in an accident. I couldn't find my phone anywhere in the car. Fire ran down my neck, following my spine and distributing itself through my body and out my digits. In my rattled state I struggled to get my bearings, to focus on anything other than the contents of my stomach. I cut the engine, ""I'm gonna stay here a short while."" 

I sat there and worked the tension out of my hands. Breathe in, breathe out. I leaned back my head, placing my crown squarely on the headrest. Warm iron-tasting liquid had begun to seep from my tongue forming a small pool situated along my bottom row of teeth. 

""Plink""

""Plink, plink.""

""Plink, plink, plink.""

I jammed my thumb into the steering wheel as I sloppily and frantically reached for the ignition.

""Click-click-click.""

I pumped the stiff brake pedal and forced the key clockwise.

""Click-click-click""

Again.

""Click-click-click""

""Plink""

That one landed in the direct center of my windshield. As I shot my eyes up it darted out of my periphery. The rain had slowed to a drizzle, and now I could hear footsteps scampering about the car.

""Wham!"" It charged my passenger door. A deafening cacophony of thuds as it scaled my sunroof. The child leaped to the hood and stared directly at me.

""What the fuck is that-"" The words jumbled and twisted out of my mouth.

The child's grizzled brown fur was made slick by the rain and light of the moon. Its beady black eyes darted from me to the contents of my car and back to me. His little chest rising and falling as its cleft 4 fingered hands explored my windshield. It pressed its snout against the glass, grey and green plasma bubbling from its two gaping nostrils. 

I laid on my horn. Furiously beating the steering wheel and beeping in rapid protest.

It squealed. Frightened and angered by the noise it hopped and dug its tusk into my windshield before flailing and launching itself back into the dark. Scampering on all fours into the inky blackness of night. My windshield fractured, and I attempted to start the car again. My headlights flickered revealing the feral thing just ahead. The engine sputtered, struggling to start.

Guttural grunts and high-pitched whines filled the treeline. Every direction was engrossed by the war cry of wild hogs. 

Their squeals pierced my eardrums as a veritable tribe of bipedal swine emerged from the thicket. Of all sizes, some hairy, some nude, brown and black fur, tusks of varying lengths. Soulless eyes peered at my solitary island of machinery. They stumbled ahead, snorting and squealing as they closed the distance.

The hog people made their approach and I flooded my engine. 

""C'mon c'mon. Work damn it!"" I violently shook the steering wheel and beat a fist on my dashboard. ""Please! For the love of God!"" I shouted as one of the pigs snarled and charged the driver's side door.

The car lazily chugged to life and my dash illuminated. I pumped the accelerator and failed to budge as the first two hogs made contact with my car. 

One of the feral things hit my car with such force it left a bloodied snout print on my window. It stammered back and reached its 4 fingered hoof hand to the wound. It began to hungrily lap at its own blood.

At this sight, another larger beast stopped inches from the injured hog's face. Its snout twitched, examining the damage. The pig dashed its mighty tusk across the throat of the other and began biting at the hole.

At this, the pigs swarmed the dying creature. They voraciously ripped with their cleft appendages. Gnashing their teeth, and gnawing its sinewy flesh. Blood soaked the faces of the feasters. Squealing with delight as they dined upon one of their own. A dog pile of 15 or more three to four-foot-tall pig people were tearing the carcass clean at my door. Still, my car wouldn't budge.

The grizzly scene before me made it clear there was only one way out. I shot a hand to my glove box gripping a clump of McDonald's napkins. Drawing them close to my face I spat the small amount of blood that had pooled after the accident.  I carefully cracked the window and stuffed the bloody napkins in the crevice. I quickly rolled the window up, suspending my blood there above the frenzy. 

One particularly famished pig, that had been left on the outskirts of the feed, was kept through the crowd. Its snout twitched and it let out a deep and terrifying scream. 

One by one the feral hog men took notice of me. They turned their attention from the bones at their hooves and all pushed to sink their gaping maws onto my own warm flesh. All of their attention and focus, now dedicated to pushing and rocking my car from the driver's side. 

The car teetered and I braced as I was cut free from the mud. The Hyundai's engine roared as we charged from the field back to the main road.

I sailed down the loam and gravel with the hogs in hot pursuit. They galloped on all fours through the mud and blood.

I inched the window down. The blood-soaked napkins fluttered out of my vehicle and floated back behind the hogs. The things all stopped and twirled chasing the napkins. The pack of mutant pig people faded out of view, trading the dim red flood for darkness.

A final bump in the road was my sign I was nearing civilization. I had returned to the county-maintained road. At breakneck speeds I made record time getting back to Golden Gate Parkway. The black asphalt glistened on the freshly watered roadway. A few minutes later I pulled into the Waffle House on exit 101.

Ignoring the dents, the scratches, the fractures, the mud, and the blood; I grabbed my iPad from my guitar case. I scarfed down my eggs and sausage and began to write.

The sun's coming up now and the lady behind the counter has been giving me weird glances ever since I sat down. I don't know if anyone out there will believe what I saw out in the Picayune, but I know I have no reason to return to the blocks in the Golden Gate Estates anytime soon.

Just as I'm about to pay, I swear I see a rock plink against the restaurant window.

Imagine being friends or colleagues or mutual friends with someone and they ask you out because they believed you had good rapport, and you have mutual friends that can vouch for the guy. And then the girl goes silent because she isn't interested but doesn't know what to say. The whole time, the guy is (reasonably) expecting a response because the two of you are in the same circles and know each other well enough. Isn't it more awkward for everyone involved if the girl just goes ghost? Isn't she essentially implying that she is fine with cutting off all communication going forward?

One night, my roommate and me got physical (a mild hook-up) and I came to know that he has been in an on-off relationship with a girl for around 7 years. And the girl has also moved to another city in the States to be closer to him. He said that he wants only a physical relationship and doesn’t want anyone in his life seriously for the next few years as he builds his career. I lied to myself and said, I can definitely do a hook-up. But my feelings started increasing because he would do things for me.! He makes me food, takes care of me during my periods, makes me breakfast and coffee, worries if I don’t reply to his messages etc. Last night, as we got more intimate (haven’t had sex yet!), he finally said that he thinks I want something more than physical. So, he wants us to stop. He still has a lot of things to shift through with his on-off GF. He also said he will never want me emotionally. I know I should believe what he is saying.

1i22nh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1i22nh1/confusion_over_machinescapsules/,Confusion over machines/capsules ,"Hi all,

I buy a coffee almost every day, but I am looking to purchase my first Nespresso machine and I am really confused.  I drink only espresso based drinks. I primarily want to make a large latte every morning with 4 shots of espresso. My typical Starbucks order is a venti brown sugar shaken espresso (with cold foam sometimes). 

From reading on this sub, it seems like if you only want espresso, you should go with an original machine. But then it also appears that original machines only take single shot espresso capsules. I think this would mean I would need to use four pods to make a four shot drink. It seems odd to me than a machine designed for lattes would only sell capsules with one espresso shot. Plus it seems it would end up being about the same cost as my Starbucks drink, which of course it is still nice to have espresso at home and not have to run out, but still notable and unexpected to me. 

The Verturo machines have double shot capsules, so with that machine I would need only two capsules to make my drink. This seems to be a better concept, but then most people on the sub say the VL is more watered down, which I definitely do not want. 

Maybe I am confused. Thank you for any help or explanations you can provide! ",1,1736962028.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

1i22n69,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1i22n69/my_neighbor_perched_himself_on_top_of_a_pine_tree/,"My neighbor perched himself on top of a pine tree in my backyard and never came down. Only a day later, the sheriff of our small town did the same. ","
When Henry perched himself atop that pine tree, I thought he’d just lost his damn mind. No amount of convincing from Jim or the sheriff could coax him down. He ascended into the canopy and never returned.

Never returned alive, at least.

He’d always been an eccentric. It wasn’t easy living next-door to Henry, but it certainly wasn’t dull, either. Between the small city of birdhouses he maintained around the perimeter of his two-story house, the free homebrewed mead that appeared on our doorstep the first of every month, and the early morning French Horn recitals, he was a handful.

I rather liked the ongoing spectacle, all things considered. Jim never really saw the humor in Henry’s mania. That said, crippling agoraphobia has prevented me from leaving the house for almost a year now, so my threshold for what qualifies as entertainment is quite a low bar to clear.

My husband was on his way to confront Henry about his newest hobby, metal detecting, when he first scaled that twenty-foot tall pine in our backyard. It wasn’t the act of metal detecting that bothered Jim - it was the many untended holes that vexed him. The sixty-something year old found himself too lost in paroxysms of archeological fervor to bother filling the quarries back up with soil after he made them. After days of steady excavation, it looked like Henry had been sweeping his property for landmines.

That morning, Jim saw the man creeping towards the edge of the forest thirty yards from our kitchen window, and he sprung into action. If I’m recalling correctly, he shouted something like, “*I’m going to nip this in the bud*” as he jogged out the front door, which now carries a cruel cosmic irony when examined in retrospect.

The scene unfolded before me through the dusty lens of our den’s cheap telescope, which has a lovely panoramic view of the backyard and the thicket beyond from where we keep it.

As much as it pains me to admit it, fear of the space outside my house has turned me into a bit of a snoop.

Jim sauntered up to our neighbor, but Henry didn’t turn around to greet him. Nor did he stop lurching forward. He didn't even react to Jim, as far as I could tell. It was like he was moving in slow-motion autopilot. Although irritated, it wasn’t like my husband’s molten rage drove Henry to the top of that pine out of a concern for his safety.

No matter what Jim did or said, Henry remained locked in an impenetrable trance. A man on a mission.

He gave up on catching Henry’s attention by the time he had made it three quarters of the way up. As Jim started to walk back, I kept watching. Henry, the sleepwalker, never changed his pace. Each identical movement was eerily slow and deliberate. After reaching the apex, he positioned himself to face our home, extended both arms palms up in front of his chest, and became impossibly still. An unblinking gargoyle baking in the early morning summer sun.

At least, I thought he was stationary.

When I checked on him an hour later through the telescope, however, he had spun his torso about thirty degrees west. Arms still extended, eyes still open, but his body had turned. Concerned and captivated in equal measure, I began observing him continuously.

While I watched, nothing seemed to change, and I was becoming progressively unnerved by his uncanny stillness. But when I paused my vigil after about twenty minutes, something occurred to me - he *was* moving. I could tell when I brought my eye away from the telescope. Looking through the den window, his torso had clearly pivoted another fifteen degrees clockwise. The motion was just so slow that I found it hard to perceive in real time.

I put my eye back to the lens of the telescope.

Henry’s skin was developing a red sheen. His unblinking eyes were dry and tinged with brown specks, like overcooked egg whites.

That’s when I called the sheriff.

The grizzled southerner and his doe-eyed deputy arrived quickly, seeing as they were only a three-minute drive down the road. They stood at the base of that pine for an hour, but couldn’t find the language to persuade Henry down either. Flustered and out of patience, the sheriff told us he would involve the fire department tomorrow if Henry remained in the tree.

When night fell, I couldn’t visualize Henry through the telescope anymore. But I could *hear* him. From our bedroom window, faintly sobbing somewhere in the blackness.

I found myself posted up in the den before the sun even rose, my mind burning with curiosity. Black coffee trickled down my throat, warming my marrow. For a moment, I felt ashamed of the excitement rumbling around in my chest.

The more I reflected on the sensation, however, the more I understood it. Journalism used to be my life before the cumulative horrors I documented manifested as a crippling fear of the world. In the grand scheme of things, this stakeout was pathetic. It didn't hold a candle to what I had done before, in a past life. But fascination, not dread, drove me to do it, and that held value.

Henry had not moved from his steeple, and by the time the sun appeared over the horizon, he had stifled his tears. His biceps were red and swollen, likely muscle breakdown from keeping them outstretched in the same position for over twenty-four hours.

A little after eight, Jim made his way downstairs. He was unusually quiet. Initially, I attributed his silence to low-level distress, secondary to Henry’s unexplained behavior. When I finally noticed him, he was standing by the front door, away from the view of our neighbor’s macabre display.

I asked him if he was doing alright, and he replied with an affirmative grunt, so I left him be.

Around noon, I felt a theory crystallize in my skull. Henry was twisting around the tree’s axis with a pace and direction identical to yesterday's. He must be watching something, I thought. That’s when it hit me.

Henry was angling his eyes and his body to constantly face the sun.

My mind scrambled to process this observation, but Jim’s heavy breathing behind me broke my concentration. It scared the shit out of me because I didn’t hear him approach. Startled, I urged him to explain what the hell he was doing.

*“Oh…fixing clock,”* he replied.

Except there was no clock. In actuality, he had his face pressed to the window that was to the right of me. He was staring at something.

I didn’t want to believe it at first. But by the afternoon, I was forced to confront the realization. From where I sat in the den, I could see Henry’s back through the telescope, and when I moved my eye away, I could see Jim’s back, silently gazing forward.

Early that morning, he had been watching the sun rise from our front door, just the same as Henry had from atop the pine tree.

My husband was following the trajectory as well.

Before I could dial 9-1-1, the sheriff and his deputy appeared in my peripheral vision. My burst of relief was short-lived when I observed how they were walking. Their footfalls were languid and protracted, the same as Henry’s had been yesterday.

As their hands contacted two different pine trees in unison, I refocused the telescope on Henry. To my horror, they were not climbing the tree where my neighbor sat to rescue him.

The possessed men were scaling their own trees, each equidistant from Henry’s.

In a state of detached shock, I moved a shaky hand to my notebook to jot down one last detail I had noticed about Henry.

Tiny mushrooms had sprouted from his eye sockets, palms and his open mouth. A robin rested on his forehead, nibbling at the growing fungus.

A wave of primal terror washed over me, and I sprinted from the chair to my front door, pausing as my hand twisted the knob.

I tried to force myself through the threshold. My head pivoted back to Jim for motivation, who hadn’t moved an inch, in spite of the noise of the chair and the telescope crashing to the floor when I sprang up.

Unable to overcome my agoraphobia, I instead sat down on the doormat and placed my head in my hands.

Whatever Henry succumbed to, it had spread to the sheriff, the deputy, and my husband. I contemplated calling 9-1-1, but what if it just spread to emergency medical services as well?

I’m not sure how long I lingered there, catatonic. The blood-chilling wails of my husband returned my consciousness to my body.

It had become night.

The absence of natural light had made Jim into a messy human puddle on the kitchen floor.

I tiptoed over to my husband, doing my best to ignore the pangs of terror vibrating in my spine. He had simply crumbled where he stood when the sun set, kneeling unnaturally with his chest and torso leaning against the wall below our kitchen window.

Despite knowing he wasn’t, I asked if he was okay a handful of times, receiving no reply.

Standing over him, I tilted his shoulder, trying to see his face. Jim limply fell over in response. He was still crying softly, eyes open but producing no tears.

That’s when I noticed his chest wasn’t moving.

He wasn’t breathing.

When I found the courage to check, he had no pulse, and I lost consciousness.

I woke up a few hours later.

Through the telescope, I could see my husband perched on a pine tree of his own, arms outstretched and eyes still open. Hellish choreography modeled by Henry, mimicked by the sheriff, the deputy, and Jim.

My current theory is as follows: Henry must have accidentally unearthed something old and terrible digging holes in his backyard. A parasitic fungus lying dormant under the soil, infecting everyone who went near with inhaled spores once it was exposed.

I’m going to make it outside today. I'll grab a shovel from the garage, and I'll fill every single hole Henry made with layers of soil. Maybe I’ll survive uninfected, but I suspect I will succumb to whatever this thing is as well.

It’s the least I can do to honor Jim’s memory.

I’m taking the time to document and post this for two reasons.

First and foremost, don’t end up like me. I hid from the world because it felt safer. But it wasn’t safer, it was just easier, and I wasted precious time.

Secondly, if you see anyone perched on a tree, eyes following the trajectory of the sun, burn the tree down or run. Whatever you do, cover your mouth, because that robin ate some of the fungus that grew from Henry, and may disseminate the spores as far as it can fly.

The start of its life cycle? It’s unclear, and I think that, unfortunately, the world may have an answer to that question in a few days.

Would you feel offended if someone you were hooking up with was telling you every single time they hooked up with someone else?,"I (37f) met a guy (40m) on Tinder in September. It was my first situationship. I'm emotional so I apologize in advance if this post seems like a wall of nonsensical text.

When we first met, we went on a date and continued to see where it goes, we had a really good connection and I was having fun and enjoyed his company so I was fine with that. We were hanging out once or twice a week for a month and texting each other throughout the day when we could. I was developing a crush on him but I didn't want to say anything because he told me in passing he wasn't looking for anything serious. I was aware it was in situationship territory but I enjoyed the company so I was okay with it, as I was still on dating sites talking to people.

One day he asked me if I would be offended if he hooked up with a guy. I was taken aback by it and I was really silent. he asked me why I was silent, I was honest and reluctantly told him I liked him. We discussed our relationship being casual and I told him just not to tell me details about his hooking up with other people. I never brought up liking him again or anything to do with progressing our relationship.

He ended the ""seeing where it goes"" a couple of months in because he said he wanted to take a step back from dating, felt like it was getting too ""relationshippey"", told me it seemed like we weren't on the same page, and told me I was texting him too much throughout the day (I'd send 5 at most like usual, about the same as he'd send to me without an issue). I send my friends memes and random funny things throughout the day, including him at that point. I felt treated unfairly because in my mind, I was treating him as I'd treat another friend. He hadn't objected before about it, so I thought it was okay. It felt like he was moving the goalposts and like I had to walk on eggshells when sending him a message. It felt like because he brought it up, he was making it relationshippey, not me. I didn't want anything more than what we were doing.

Then the next day he asked me to go for coffee. We hooked up again then agreed to a casual relationship. We didn't talk as often as before, just hooked up sometimes, but ""relationship possibilities"", as he put it, were definitely there. He'd have chances to hook up, and I repeatedly told him he didn't have to tell me about him hooking up with other people, as we're casual so he's not obligated to share that stuff with me. He told me he wanted to be honest about it. While we agreed to honesty about hooking up with other people, I didn't agree to being told about every. single. hookup and the details of how it went. Myself, I'm a private person and I'm unaccustomed to telling people about my hookups so from my perspective, it just seems like a weird thing to do in general, especially toward someone you're already hooking up with. Myself, I just don't feel like those conversations are necessary in a casual relationship.

On Saturday night he told me he needed to tell me something. I'm like okay shoot. He told me he was waiting on a hookup. I told him thanks for telling me. Later that night, he told me he was invited over the next night and he acted really giddy and nervous about it while talking to me about it.

I felt disrespected that he'd let me on his feeling excited and nervous to hook up with another person. I felt rejected and insecure. I'm not proud to admit that but yeah.

I told him his things would be in his mailbox and said something nasty to him out of anger and the feeling of being done with it. That kind of thing is out of character for me and I regret how I reacted. It felt cathartic, it just feels like three months of what was supposed to be fun turned into an emotional minefield for no reason and I was tired of the relationship not feeling easy.",4,1736961906.0,AskWomenOver30,36,0.7,False

Within my squadron we have 45 people 6 six of which who are officers. Two of the officers are female including myself ( I was promoted a few months back). A role of the officers is to make teas and coffees for Staff of a higher rank. Within my rank (the lowest of officers) there are 3 boys plus myself. 

When it comes to the time of making tea and coffee the majority of the time I am the one told to do it whilst the boys do the counting for the money books. Also I am left to do more cleaning jobs that everyone is told to do.

I have had enough of constantly being chosen. What would be a smart way to be able to get myself to do an equal amount of work with breaks because when I am making tea I do not have a break. I also cannot give these people in trouble as they are an equal rank and I’d like to avoid going to a high up person.

I have a male coworker and we both work on the same project so we got closer naturally, we first started getting coffee together at work, then it was on a coffeeshop in front of where we work, then it became a daily thing where he'd text me where are you I'm waiting for you to get coffee then we talk about random things, movies/ work/ celebrity gossip... so no intimate or personal stuff.

we also leave work and take public transportation together since we live in the same part of the city.

now he randomly calls me during the day sometimes even when not working to tell me about random stuff that reminded him of something we talked about.

the conversation is purely platonic, never flirted or anything but I feel like I'm doing something wrong and at the same time don't want to lose my only friends at work.

I'm a very paranoid person and I have a chronic feeling of shame so I can't tell if I should really feel guilty or if it's just my mind playing games again.

I was recently diagnosed and I’m looking for a little wisdom from those of you who have been around longer. My cystitis is mild— The worst it’s ever gotten has been moderate to severely uncomfortable, but doesn’t really get painful (at least so far). It comes and goes, and I think I eventually will be able to eat and drink relatively normally when I’m not having a flare and cut out my acid/caffeine/etc intake during a flareup (having a decaf coffee now for the first time in weeks and it feels like a huge victory for me lol). There’s a lot of conflicting advice online about what works and what doesn’t to help treat or prevent a flareup, so I’d like to hear what anyone thinks! I know a lot will vary person-to-person, but I’d like to know other people’s experiences :)

Can probiotics actually help? If so, what kind do you use?
What do you find helps for pain management? 
Is Prelief legit? 
Any low-acid recipes/hacks for getting some flavour back when avoiding acid/high spice? (I’ve been cooking everything with fresh garlic and herbs— it’s been a lifesaver)
Do any of you still drink coffee regularly with minimal/no negative effects? 
If you eat a trigger food/drink, how long does it take you to get a flareup? How long does it take your flareup to go away?

1i22ftm,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1i22ftm/narc_mom_memories/,Narc mom memories,"I have some of the things that had happened to me written down since the trauma makes me forget the facts so I can read it to my therapist (I hope sooner than later). For some context, I'm 17 and my bf is living with me and he has a house where he ""lives"" with her sister (he spends much more time in my house and he likes to sleep w me, we've been together for almost 2 years). 


Here are some memories of my dearest mom

- “I had a smaller waist than you at your age”


- When I was 11, I started feeling bad, self harming and feeling anxious. At that time, I trusted her and told her everything, but she invalidated it and I lost trust in her because I felt abandoned. She told me that I had to be happy with the simple things in life, like the smell of toast or coffee, and from that moment on, she always tells me that I have to take charge of my anxiety, that it happened to her too and that she learned the hard way and that I should do it too, that it's just willpower.


- When she threw a tantrum because I explicitly told my gynecologist that I DID NOT want pills and my mom insisted on giving her the prescription for the pills and the doctor said no because I had explicitly said that I didn't want them. After that, my mom abandoned me and I hsd to go out to look for her, she was blaming me the whole way home, telling me that she knew better, that she wanted me to take pills for birth control and that I shouldn't have talked or asked things (DURING THE CONSULTATION) and we ended up arguing more at home. As usual, we argued in such a way that the issue got worse, causing me to have brain fog and lose focus of the discussion (something that is repeated when I argue with her, she always ends up turning the tables, making me feel bad, saying that I criticize her, that I want to compete with her, that I disobey her and that I should blindly believe in her because she is my mother).


- She complained that I spent her stuff (because I used personal hygiene products but they were all hers, I had to use HER creams and HER makeup and HER brushes, etc.) and when I started being in a relationship and he bought me things, my mom complained that he was pampering me too much, that I disobeyed her and that after I spent everything, he would buy me things and she would be left with nothing. I have never had anything of my own because everything belongs to her, nor my own space because she is a compulsive hoarder and my entire room is full of her things, not even 80% of my room is mine, she never let me decorate it the way I wanted and only when I was like 11 years old and after many fights I was able to organize it the way I wanted. She would get mad because we didn't bring her food when we went out on dates and she would force us to bring food for her or for my brother (when we could, we always brought food for my brother, but it wasn't always possible). She complained that we lived like adults because she thought we were intimate and she sexualized everything.


- My bf and I were celebrating our first aniverssary together and we bought chocolates. One day we were choosing which ones to eat and she came and pulled one out aggressively, to which I told her it was disrespectful and she got defensive and told me I was selfish, how could I deny my own mother a chocolate, when in reality if she hadn't forcefully pulled it out, I would have given it to her. She always thought she had the right to touch me or handle things as she wanted, she thinks she owns everything so she can do whatever she wants with you as well as other things.


- Before I was with my bf, we always had arguments that didn't have any achievement, it was just her complaints, whether it was about cleaning, my dad, her shitty life, etc. She made me feel guilty and held me responsible for things. I tried to improve but I never understood exactly what was wrong, she used to tell me it was common sense. She made me feel confused and I came to hate myself a lot for being the way I was. I thought I was enslaving her because she said we were vile and bloodthirsty with her. Then I realized it was the other way around.


- As for cleaning, it's done only when she wants and feels like it. She always complains about cleaning and that I and the rest of the family are dirty, but we always have to adapt to what she wants, including how and when to clean. It has to be how SHE likes it and if we don't do it that way she gets angry, and it has to be WHEN she wants, because otherwise she says we are putting her under pressure. Turns out I'm more hygenic than her and she's just projecting her dirtiness.


- My mom always uses the excuse that she feels bad to not do things, whether it's her period, headaches, tiredness, etc. But when it happens to me it's a different story, because suddenly, I have to keep going even if I feel bad, and just because she feels bad doesn't mean that life stops. When she has her period, I has to take care of her and worry about her, but if I have my period, I have to work just the same.


- One day I went to an appointment with my gynecologist, I don't really know if it was the same day I mentioned before or another, but I went to the gynecologist and after going to the appointment I went with her and my partner to a cafeteria that is in front of the clinic, the fact is that we were talking about reproductive health and the methods that were available and which one I was going to choose. There I confessed to her that I was no longer a virgin and that my partner and I had already had sex, we talked about trust and related issues, etc. I confessed to her that I didn't trust her and I found it hard to open up, to which she reacted defensively, saying that she had given a lot for the life she gave us, I was shocked by the conversation because she couldn't understand me and was defensive all the time, there was a point where I told her that she wasn't my mother, she wasn't the one I knew as a child, that she has changed, and I fainted from the stress. She was telling me all the time to control myself, that she was the bad mother now, that I made her feel guilty and that maybe she was the one who was wrong and that I was ambarrasing her, I was dissociated the rest of the week.


- Being with her is like walking on eggs, the whole mood of the house depends on her, if she is even slightly irritable, the whole house is tense and alert. When I ask her to go out or take me to the doctor, she always leaves me hanging, she never says yes or no (when I have told her that if she really doesn't agree, she should just say no), when I ask her to give me an answer, she tells me that I am pressuring her, that I am only talking to her to ask her for things, that I should do what is right, that deciding is just common sense (she always says that I need it). She will never answer a question that overwhelms her or doesn't suit her, directly.


- When I turned 11, I began to question her, I began to develop my own thoughts and that bothered her, since it was not what she wanted me to think. In an argument in which I wanted to know the reason for her answer, she simply throws me out, ignores me, changes the subject or insults me, that time (and it was very obvious to me) she told me that I would always be the thorn in her side.


- In many discussions I was overwhelmed by confusion, talking to her drained me and many times she changed the story to benefit her and made me believe that something else had happened.


- She stole money from me.


- When I started dating, she insisted on making me look bad to my partner, she told him embarrassing things about me or my personal flaws, until now she takes advantage of every moment to talk badly about me. She has even cried to him to make me feel bad. One day I told her that it was not right and that I preferred that he knew my flaws by himself, I asked her not to say those things that embarrassed me and she answered with a ""you shouldn't be ashamed"", ""I'm your mother"", ""at some point he will know that you are like that anyway"", in a certain way she expected my boyfriend to sympathize more with her than with me and defend her, but when she saw the opposite, she complained to my partner about how he was obviously going to be by my side and was not going to be impartial. - Many times I have taken the initiative to her how I feel about how she treats me, the things that make me feel bad, the conflicts that I want to solve, but it's not possible, she will always get defensive and say that I'm lying, that I'm sensitive, etc. And she will end up complaining that I always criticize her, and I will surely end up apologizing.


- She has called me insensitive, unempathetic, stupid, she told me that I was an ice eardrum, that she doesn't understand why I ""hate"" her or  why I don't show her affection if she is super loving and has never lacked anything and that it is my boyfriend's fault for spoiling me too much and that I do not deserve it.


- She makes me look bad with people outside the family and with my own family, she changes the story and humiliates me but when they talk about her, she has never done anything wrong.


- I have an eating disorder, generalized anxiety and OCD, I have begged to go to the psychologist since I was 11 years old and she has never wanted to take me because she knows that I would make her look bad.


- She complains that I do not talk to her or tell her things about myself but when I talk to her about something I like, she ignores me, especially if it is about something that she does not like or does not suit her. She has told me that it's a lot of money, that my body is not made for it, that it'd be a waste of time, that I'm not thin enough or that I don't dance well, but she loves to talk (monologue) about what she likes and she loves to talk badly about other people, she loves to be right, she says that she doesn't care about ehat other people think but she lives based on looks.


- She says that she is human, that she is sensitive, empathetic, strong, she admits she's wrong but, she is never wrong, she never apologizes.


- She is interested in me only when it suits her and she likes it or to look good, but when she does not like something, she ignores me and tells me that I am old enough to take care of myself on my own (she says that I pretend to be an adult, that I do not behave like someone my age) and that I should not involve her, but when I do, she gets angry with me because she is my mother and I must obey her in everything.


- She spends all day on the phone, but she complains that I live in my room.

As the snow fell down on North Campus’ quad on a dark January afternoon, Victor Stone felt a bit melancholy. Perhaps some part of him was already thinking about the end, knowing this would be one of the last times he saw campus with its soft white blanket of snow cover. And as he walked gently across it, he couldn’t help but feel like his little time remaining as a student would be just as fleeting as the snowflakes that drifted by him: there one moment, then gone into a pile of memories like all of the others.

But, as he walked into the building that housed Dr. Morah’s lab, the wave of heat melted away those feelings for now. He was far more interested in what would be happening here today than he was worried about the future. It wasn’t unusual for him to be here on a Saturday, but Dr. Tomek Morah had reached out to Donna Morris and him, now the most senior members of his lab, saying he had a big update to the lab for them. Neither of them were sure what to expect. Maybe it was a new project they’d won through a grant or maybe Dr. Morah was going on another sabbatical and would be gone the rest of the semester and wanted to say goodbye. 

Vic stood in front of the door to the lab and scanned his student ID. The door didn’t unlock. He tried it again without any luck. 
 
“ID not working?” Donna walked up and scanned hers but the door still didn't open.

“Nope. Guess we’re stuck waiting for him.”

Vic sat on the carpet next to the door and she sat next to him. 

“So, any idea of what you’re doing after graduation yet?”

Vic shook his head. “Not really. I want to go back to Detroit but haven’t really had any luck finding something at any of the big names. So I’m probably going to start looking outside the state. You?”

“I’ve got a job lined up at my dad’s consulting company. I know they’re looking for a couple more people so I could put your name out there if you want.”

“Yeah, that’d be great. I -”

Dr. Morah slammed open the door and looked down at Donna and Vic. 

“Apologies that I am late. Please, come in.” Dr. Morah looked like he hadn’t slept for days and had the smell to match. His clothes were disheveled and his hair was a mess, but neither of those were as bad as the lab itself which looked like a tornado had torn its way through it.

Donna and Vic followed Dr. Morah into the disaster of a lab, in awe at the devastation they were witnessing. Papers and whiteboards were thrown about at random and all of the wall mounted whiteboards were full of unintelligible drawings and words, some of which spilled over onto the walls themselves. The lab was never completely organized, but this was a new low.

He led them back to his office which he clearly hadn’t been using as it was more or less in its normal state. Not clean or organized, but far less of a mess than the rest of the lab. He sat across his desk and gestured for Donna and Vic to sit across from him.

“So, I assume you are both wondering what I have asked you here for.”

They nodded.

“Do you remember my machine that allowed me to see the future? ([See Cyborg 40!](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/comments/y4x6au/cyborg_40_seeing_red/)) I have been working on it as a side project these past few years, trying to improve the device to allow me to see more than that one moment in time to answer the ultimate question. What causes the end of the world?”

Dr. Morah grabbed a coffee mug from the middle of a stack of papers and took a sniff before drinking it. He wrinkled his nose and set it back on the table. 

“Unfortunately, that question specifically still does not have an answer. Whatever led to that ruined, burned out world devoid of life, I cannot say. Instead, I have created perhaps the ultimate tool for preventing it. As a result of a process that I can barely explain, I upgraded my device to allow me to look at any point in time. 

“At first, I did not trust it, but over the past week I have confirmed it. Everything I have seen from then to now has been completely correct. I know that you both will doubt me, so please, look at this envelope.” 

He opened up his desk and pulled out a stamped letter addressed from Dr. Morah to the lab, postmarked from five days ago. He handed Donna the letter.

“Please read the letter to Vic, Donna. Note the date on the envelope.”

She opened it up and read. “‘Donna and Vic followed Dr. Morah into the disaster of a lab, in awe at the devastation they were witnessing. Papers and whiteboards were thrown about at random and all of the wall mounted whiteboards were full of unintelligible drawings and words, some of which spilled over onto the walls themselves. The lab was never completely organized, but this was a new low.

'He led them back to his office which he clearly hadn’t been using as it was more or less in its normal state. Not clean or organized, but far less of a mess than the rest of the lab. He sat across his desk and gestured for Donna and Vic to sit across from him.’

“Oh, there’s a little more on the back. ‘Donna was wearing a red and purple striped sweater with dark jeans and brown boots while Vic wore a blue quarter zip over a black shirt, jeans and sneakers.’”

They looked at eachother, confirming that the letter was completely accurate.

“Do you see? The machine works flawlessly and with absolute accuracy. And what it has shown me is the complete devastation of the planet and all of its inhabitants. So you see the problem: how can I save the world when I know it is doomed with perfect certainty?”

Vic and Donna thought in silence for a few moments before he spoke up. 

“Why not just change something? Like if I had gone to the gym like I wanted to this morning, I’d be wearing different clothes. But I forgot to set an alarm, so I just threw this on.”

Dr. Morah nodded. “Excellent, yes. That was the path I came up with too. However, let’s say instead of your clothes, I had told you the winning lottery numbers for today. You would not be able to change that, no? And that is the crux of the problem. I need to create a chain of events to stop that future from occurring but the amount of steps from now to that future are difficult to predict.”

“And so, you want us to come up with things we can change to cause a big enough change to the future to divert the crisis?” Donna said.

“Correct. I have come up with many solutions to the problem and tested them, but all have ended the same way. I believed it was time to expand my search. I will still continue to come up with ideas on my own, but I feel that you two are more… in touch and will be better able to find the solutions we are looking for.”

“Can we use the machine to te - ”

“No. Now that it can be used for short term things, I cannot let knowledge of it fall into the wrong hands. It’s not that I do not trust you both in general, but on this matter I barely trust myself. Once you have a plan, tell me about it and I will check the machine and see what changed.”

Vic reluctantly nodded. 

“Now then, I am in dire need of a shower and a break will do my mind good. Please feel free to use the lab in my absence but lock up afterwards. I do not want even the janitors to enter until we have this matter resolved.”

With that, Dr. Morah grabbed his jacket from the coat rack and left the lab to Vic and Donna. 

They left his office and started to pour over all the things that Dr. Morah had concocted.  Taking a better look at the notes he left on the whiteboards, they could make out that each of them contained all sorts of plans from orbital defense lasers, to curing cancer, to creating a telepathic android, but none of them had succeeded in preventing the future that he saw.

Vic and Donna tried to come up with their own solutions and ideas but with so many variables, it was a beyond daunting task with no clear starting point. Finally, they grew exasperated after several hours without success.

“Probably should have asked earlier but you’ve actually seen that future right? When Dr. Morah was talking about it, it sorta seemed like you were thinking back on it.  Did anything stick out to you?” 

“Yeah, but it’s not helpful. The world that he showed me looked a lot like Apokolips, a world ruled by Darkseid, pretty much the most evil, awful guy ever. My guess at the time was that he somehow took over the Earth. But stopping evil space beings is a big ask.”

“Well sure, but we could make a plan to be more prepared or at least delay him.” 

“I guess that’s true. But if we delay things, it doesn’t mean we get a better future.”

“One problem at a time. Besides, there’s nothing that says we have to have only one plan. They could work in parallel.”

Vic nodded. “Yeah, yeah that could work. I just don’t really have anything in mind to fix, well, everything.”

“I think that’s missing the point. It’s not about fixing everything in some grand show of brilliance that fixes everything in one swoop as dramatic and heroic as that’d be. We need to take this one step at a time and fix what we know.”

“Maybe that’s why Morah’s been failing too. He wants a cure all instead of just accepting imperfection as a step towards a better tomorrow.”

“So… you want to be the one to tell him that our idea is to use his ideas?”

They laughed for a little bit and then got back to work. Vic was still struggling to make any ideas that seemed like they could possibly stop Darkseid’s invasion. What confused him was that there would have to be some trigger for him to invade and some reason that the Justice League and all of the other heroes would lose but what? He couldn’t think of anything.

He looked over at Donna to see if she was having any better luck and noticed that she looked like she was looking at him, constantly on the verge of saying something but couldn’t find the words. He considered asking her about it and they locked eyes for just a second. He was about to speak up, but before he could, she mustered the courage.

“Vic… you know I do have another plan. Well… it’s a part of that one… No! No, it’s not a part of this, it’s its own thing. I *promise* you, this has nothing to do with Dr. Morah. It’s just… ”

She took a deep breath. “It’s just that I… When Dr. Morah told us about the world, how it was doomed to be a hellscape, I wasn’t concerned about that. No, the first thing on my mind was what happened to you. I don’t know when the admiration became something more, I suppose that’s how it always goes. Some people believe in love at first sight but I don’t. For me, love is something that sneaks up on you, like a spark that slowly grows into something more. Everything you do only makes that inferno grow brighter and stronger.

“I don’t know or even care if you feel the same. I couldn’t let another week go by with me regretting having not told you how I feel for my entire college life.”

Donna finally relaxed, her shoulders having lost a great weight for a brief moment, then suddenly gaining it all back and more as she waited for what felt like millennia for Vic’s response. 

“I… I… Let me try again. Of all the words that I know, none of them could ever come close to describing your beauty or how I feel about you. So, I’m not even going to try; there’ll be plenty of time for that. Instead, how about a kiss?”

She laughed. “Kiss me you dork.”

Sometime later…

Eventually, the two of them began to pay attention to the greater world again. They started trying to brainstorm solutions again, but neither of them was in the state of mind to do so. Each of them was distracted by the weightless joy of unrealized love suddenly materializing. 

Then, he got a call, the vibrations of his phone lightly shaking the table startling them both as they were dragged back into reality.  Vic stumbled back into focus and answered it just before it went to his voicemail.

“Hello?”

“Hey Vic, I’m going to need you to get down to Central Campus as soon as you can.” Keiji said.

“Why? What’s up?”

“It’s Ratattack. He’s back and doing another rally.  I don’t know much more than that, I just got a text from someone at the Michigan Daily who figured I could pass that along to you.”

“Thanks, I’ll be there as soon as I can. Can you head over there now if you’re in the area? I’m on North Campus and I probably won’t be able to make it down there for at least 15 minutes, maybe more.”

“Yeah, I’m already on my way.”

“Thanks, Keiji. I owe you.”

“It’s on your tab. Listen, it’s a big one and it’s already getting hard to hear you. I’ll be on the east side of the plaza, otherwise let’s meet up at the apartment afterwards if you can’t find me.”

Keiji hung up and Vic set his phone back on the table. He put his hands behind his head and let out a deep exhale. 

“What’s up, Vic? What did Keiji tell you?”

“Ratattack’s back.”

Donna’s mood soured. “Vic… I know what you feel about this. Last time was… a lot for you. [(See Cyborg 31-33 for that story!)](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCFU/comments/s5ftld/cyborg_issue_31_school_days/) Maybe take some time to clear your head first?”

“Thanks but… No. He and I need to have a word with each other after what he did. I’ve grown since then and I can handle him better now without him getting in my head, I promise.”

“I’m sure you can. But… if you have to go, I’m coming with you. Everyone needs backup sometimes.”

Vic smiled, the stress leaving his eyes. “Thanks. Together, then?”

She took his hand. “Together.”

Was married in 2015, had child dec 2015. Ex husband and I were happy, until I decided to be a surrogate for a couple I met through a surrogacy service (this was 2018).  After giving birth in March, after having a c-section, and recovering, ex husband decided he didn't love me anymore. Shortly after I had to put my cat down, which was also devastating. He showed no remorse and didn't even attempt to console me. Unfortunately, due to me not being able to work for various different reasons I won't get into right now, he is the only one bringing in money which means I am dependant on him and can't leave due to it and not having anywhere else to go. 

After so many years I obviously got lonely and decided to check out dating sites and apps because why the hell not at least for conversation or meetups for coffee. This is when I met who I'll call Doug. We met up for a movie and it went well. He drove an hour to meet up and I really didn't believe anyone would bother going that far for a date with me. Low self esteem, obviously and being treated like a roommate by ex husband and ignored mostly broke me down to feel like I don't deserve anything.

Doug and I started texting each other every other day or so, depending on what he's doing (work, taking care of his kid that he also has, same age as my kid) and we hit it off. So it's maybe been a year since we've been talking and I'd rather not have him over to my place as it would be very awkward with the ex around, instead we hang out overnight once a month on a weekend at his place. 

Problem is now it's starting to get serious, not move in together serious or meet kids serious but every time we meet now we both feel the spark, miss each other, we're both trying a diet right now (intermittent fasting) and keeping each other accountable. 

Question is, do I just have a boyfriend even if separated? I'm not sure what ex will think or if he'll lose his shit. He shouldn't, seeing as he clearly tossed me aside, but I don't know if I should keep seeing Doug (who I refer to as just a friend to ex) or do I break it off and stay single until I'm finally divorced? I don't know when that'll be, btw as ex doesn't want to do the hassle right now and our taxes are much better with me and the kiddo in the house. What do I do?",0,1736961299.0,whatdoIdo,18,0.43,False

1i22cga,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1i22cga/grandparents_visit_how_often/,Grandparents visit : how often?,"
We have an 2.5 year old and a 4 month old. My husband’s parents live a 3 hour flight away and mine a 6 hour flight away.

All grandparents visited and met the baby within the first month.

Since then, both sets of grandparents are pressuring us to visit them. We travelled to both grandparents in the first year with our firstborn, so they seem to expect the same, but life is so much more hectic with two.

My husbands parents visit every 2 months for 4-5 days at a time. They aren’t staying with us because we don’t have the space, but I find it really overwhelming as I am on maternity leave and my husband is at work so i have to entertain them all day. They expect to spend every waking minute at our home. They are great at picking up/playing with our toddler after he’s back from daycare and holding the baby. However they expect us to make them coffee, meals and drink wine through the day, so then we have to constantly hand wash wine glasses. They’re not helpful with cooking or cleaning. My husband and I do the chores together.

They asked to visit again in a few weeks and we declined saying my husband is busy at work, and they are already pressuring us to then provide the next available date.

How often do you have visits from overseas family? I feel super guilty declining also as my son gets less time with grandparents, but I’m honestly so tired from being up all night breastfeeding that having 5  straight days of socialising is super draining.

Keep in mind we have to manage visits from other outstation family members in between their visits, but those are singular visits from people who want to meet the baby.

How do you deal with the guilt and balance family visits when living abroad? How often do your outstation grandparents visit?

1i22c8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/NootropicsDepot/comments/1i22c8x/why_lcitrulline_larginine_is_better_than_just/,Why L-Citrulline + L-Arginine is better than just L-Citrulline,"All right, guys, I'll try to make this a quick one. A brilliant guy on Discord—who, by the way, should definitely do his own writing—asked me to write a post about the synergy between L-citrulline and L-arginine.

As you may know, there are multiple studies showing that equal parts L-citrulline and L-arginine actually provide a better effect in terms of sports performance and nitric oxide increase when compared to using just L-arginine or just L-citrulline alone. u/Hinkle\_McKringlebry has talked about it many times. 

Now, we already know that L-citrulline is superior to L-arginine because it bypasses the first-pass metabolism. But if L-citrulline is better than L-arginine, how come combining one part L-arginine with one part L-citrulline is better than just using two parts L-citrulline?

Think about it: you have two parts of a superior compound (L-citrulline) compared to a mix of one part superior (L-citrulline) and one part inferior (L-arginine). Yet somehow, the superior plus inferior combination works better.

This is what we're going to explore today—this unique 1+1=3 synergy and how it actually works.

# Why is L-citrulline superior in the first place

L-arginine is converted into L-citrulline during the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and L-citrulline serves as a precursor for the regeneration of L-arginine via separate metabolic pathway we won't need to focus on for this post. While L-arginine supplementation has been thought to improve endothelial function, studies have shown that most orally administered L-arginine is metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract and liver by arginases 1 and 2 before it can reach the kidneys. **L-citrulline is more effective at increasing plasma L-arginine concentrations than L-arginine supplementation because it is not metabolized by arginase and can reach the kidneys where it is converted into L-arginine**

# Combination of L-citrulline and L-arginine is superior

[https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006291X14018178](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006291X14018178)

**Oral supplementation with a combination of l-citrulline and l-arginine rapidly increases plasma l-arginine concentration and enhances NO bioavailability**

“l-Citrulline plus l-arginine supplementation caused a more rapid increase in plasma l-arginine levels and marked enhancement of NO bioavailability, including plasma cGMP concentrations, than with dosage with the single amino acids”

**The effects on plasma L-arginine levels of combined oral L-citrulline and L-arginine supplementation in healthy males**

“Oral l-citrulline plus l-arginine supplementation more efficiently increased plasma l-arginine levels than 2 g of l-citrulline or l-arginine, suggesting that oral l-citrulline and l-arginine increase plasma l-arginine levels more effectively in humans when combined.”

**The Effects of Consuming Amino Acids L-Arginine, L-Citrulline (and Their Combination) as a Beverage or Powder, on Athletic and Physical Performance: A Systematic Review**

“Four electronic databases (PubMed, Ebscohost, Science Direct, and Google scholar) were used. An acute dose of 0.075 g/kg of L-Arg or 6 g L-Arg had no significant increase in NO biomarkers and physical performance markers (p > 0.05). Consumption of 2.4 to 6 g/day of L-Cit over 7 to 16 days significantly increased NO level and physical performance markers (p < 0.05). Combined L-Arg and L-Cit supplementation significantly increased circulating NO, improved performance, and reduced feelings of exertion (p < 0.05).”

**The effects on plasma L-arginine levels of combined oral L-citrulline and L-arginine supplementation in healthy males** 

“We investigated the effects of combining 1 g of l-citrulline and 1 g of l-arginine as oral supplementation on plasma l-arginine levels in healthy males. Oral l-citrulline plus l-arginine supplementation more efficiently increased plasma l-arginine levels than 2 g of l-citrulline or l-arginine, suggesting that oral l-citrulline and l-arginine increase plasma l-arginine levels more effectively in humans when combined.”

OK, but what is the reason for that? Why would the combination beat plain old L-citrulline? In the beginning I mentioned arginine’s rate limiting enzymes - arginase 1 and 2, which are responsible for its rapid breakdown. Well **L-citrulline suppresses the activity of arginase.** This allows more of the administered L-arginine to bypass first-pass metabolism and reach circulation. It is actually a strong allosteric inhibitor of arginase. 

“L-Cit acts as a strong allosteric inhibitor, as it has an inhibiting effect on arginase, which metabolises L-Arg to urea and L-ornithine”

“L-citrulline, were shown to inhibit MPEC arginase activity under maximal assay conditions.”

So there you go. L-citrulline inhibits arginase, effectively sparing the L-arginine and you get a nitric oxide increase from both L-cit and L-arg, which is bigger than that from the same quantity L-Cit.

L-arginine is not useless at all as long as you inhibit arginase. 

# Other arginase inhibitors 

There are actually better arginase inhibitors than L-cit.

* L-Norvaline - the most practical one. 250-500mg gets the job done as tested and proven by yours truly with a saliva strip test
* Cocoa Extract - flavonoids in cocoa inhibit arginase. You just have to get a decent high polyphenol extract, not munch on chocolate  
* Berberine - yes, the good old Berberine..what is it that it does not do. Well don’t use it for that, it is a moderate one, just wanted to mention it
* Resveratrol, Cinnamon extract, Agmatine -  probably on the weaker side. The data is not sufficient 
* Piceatannol - the most potent one, but not practical to use, hard to source high Piceatannol supplements
* Chlorogenic acid  - found in coffee. If you source a high % green coffee extract you can have the desired effect.

**Or just take Nitrosigine…**

Nitrosigine stabilizes arginine in its inositol-silicate form, making it less susceptible to arginase activity. This means more arginine is preserved and made available for NO production.

So that is it. Have your L-arginine. It is an awesome nitric oxide booster…just have to inhibit its breakdown. Almost everyone takes L-Cit and L-cit + L-Arg beats just L-cit so no reason to ignore L-arg in sport exercise or general health endeavors. 

EDIT: They tested 1:1 ratio for comparison purposes in these studies. In other studies they actually found 2:1 L-Cit:L-Arg to be the optimal ratio

I've actually been afraid she was going to be severely nutrient deficient because she had such an unbalanced diet. She refused to eat anything except yogurt, bananas, apples and peanut butter & jelly sandwiches. When she was 3, we started paying my MIL to babysit her so I could work. But my MIL always brought her so much junk food, chips... Ice cream... Candy. And she always made her jello and pudding from the packets. This was a daily problem. I had so many talks with her and both my husband and I, as a team, asked her to stop several times. But both my husband and I work a lot and we didn't have another option so we kept getting pushed around.

Finally, I caught her hiding instant coffee in my daughter's hot chocolate. (She's Brazilian and another argument in my home has been for her to not give my daughter coffee... As insane as that sounds) After that, my husband and I talked about everything at length and on new years eve, we let her go and hired a babysitter off a local job website. 

My god... I honestly think it was the best decision we ever made. Now just over 2 weeks later, my daughter just ate my food for the first time and I am actually crying. (She is also sleeping better which I'm trying not to think too hard about) It has been such a battle. I feel so guilty and kicking myself for letting this go so far but I am also feeling hope for the first time in forever. I know that's probably a silly thing to say about picky eating 😅

I just wanted to share a major win in my family and a reminder not to keep making excuses for problems and problem-people. It's a new year and a great time to do some housecleaning.

For anyone wondering how I turned things around, I bought a big bag of mini M&Ms (the cheap off-brand for baking) and I kept them in the freezer. Every meal I gave her just a super small amount of each part of the meal sectioned on her plate and then a few M&Ms in another section. At first she only ate the M&Ms but today she ate 2 chicken wings, almost all of her spaghetti and all of the M&Ms. Then she asked for more chicken wings. She was going to get up after eating the noodles but I showed her there were secret surprise bones inside the chicken wings, let's find them together! And we collected them in a bowl like treasure. I know it sounds silly but it worked. I follow a ton of Instagram accounts of pediatricians that talk about picky eating and how to help your child so that's where I learned this method from.

I looked up and saw flight after flight of Canada geese heading ... north east, after a quick calculation.  It was an odd time of year for them to move in groups like this (not to mention the wrong direction entirely for southern Alberta in January) and I watched as more and more appeared from the crest of my house and smiled.  Being a bird nerd, I took a moment to enjoy the sounds of their conversations as I imagined what they were talking about - who's turn it is in front, why is Frank going with the wrong group, someone tell Gertrude to get her tail in gear.  

*They used to flock in thousands, you know.  Millions.  More birds than sky.*

I felt her presence behind me as a tingle on my scalp and a twitch in my neck muscles.  It felt as always like a comforting hand on the shoulder, a bodyguard of the soul.  Her voice came into my mind unbidden, as it often did when I was distracted.  

""I wish I could have seen that"" I said to her in my mind.  

*You would have lost your damn mind* floated in my my head, with a hint of amusement.

""Will birds ever flock like that again?  In millions, like in the stories I heard?""

A pregnant silence hung between us for a few moments.

*Yes, but not in your time, or your child's.*  

""Damn.  That would have been something else.""

*You see things every day that are magic to your ancestors.*  

I take a deep breath and watch as the last flight honks and flaps its way overhead.  ""True.""

The Morrigan is about to leave my side as I get into my car, but I hear her one last time while settling into my seat.  

*Keep doing the work.  Keep getting prepared.  You've made good progress so far.  You need to be ready for what is coming.*  ",7,1736960998.0,druidism,2,1.0,False

1i226m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/1i226m4/tips_i_wish_i_knew/,Tips I Wish I Knew ,"Last year, I got invited to Coachella super last minute. I literally planned everything the weekend before W1. Almost every Coachella tips post online says the same stuff: stay hydrated, wear comfortable shoes, sunscreen. And while I agree those are important, I needed some real, small hacks for my first time at this iconic festival. So here are some things I learned from my first Coachella experience:

* **The bathrooms closer to Do LaB are actual bathrooms.** Not porta-potties.
* **They were letting GA into one of the Quasar stage platforms until capacity.**
* **Uber at Coachella is a nightmare.**
* **Don’t use the balloons as a location point.** Rookie mistake. They move throughout the day. (Pro tip: follow the end of the trail for a surprise.)
* **The Sahara hill... that's it. That’s the tip.**
* **The iced coffee inside the festival is actually fire.**
* **If you're into house and techno like me, Yuma will grab the fck out of you, and she will NOT let you go.** Be careful with this one—Yuma is amazing, but you’ll lose hours in there and forget the entire festival exists outside that tent. ( I personally felt that you will find the real Coachella magic in Mojave and Gobi)
* **Going up the tower is not worth it.** Save yourself the disappointment.
* **Coachella does not fck with fake IDs.** I saw at least three people get busted trying to snag a 21+ wristband. One day, the guy checking IDs spent almost 10min analyzing mine with a magnifying glass and showing it to others. (My ID’s from Florida, and I have a baby face—even though I was 22.)
* **All the way in the end of the porta-potties you might find bathrooms with a/c.** Gold-star discovery.
* **They don’t let you bring drinks into Yuma—just water.** There’s a easy way around this, but I’ll let you figure it out.
* **If you're driving with a group of friends, make the car your meeting spot at the end of the night.** Trust me, this is WAY better than trying to find your friends inside the festival when you’re all exhausted. (Pro tip: the parking lot gets confusing at night. Tie a balloon to your car, and you’ll spot it from far away.)
* **You will find the best people in Do LaB; the worst in Sahara.** (This has nothing to do with the artists. Just vibes.)
* **Sit the fck down.** Seriously. Take a break. Chill in the grass for an hour while watching a set from the back. You can hear and see the main stage from almost anywhere.
* **If you’re planning to use the bicycles (or as I like to call it ""Tuk Tuks”), bring cash.** It makes things smoother. But honestly, they can only take you so far, so I wouldn’t call them essential.
* **Go to a sunset set in Quasar**
* **Coachella from the left; Outdoor from the right.** You’re welcome.
* **Explore the brand activations and random structures.** You never know what you’ll find. Last year, I got free stuff AND stumbled into an apartment kitchen party in the middle of the fest.
* **My vibe prediction for this year is that you will find a very shItty crowd on keinemusik and Travis Scott**. (again this has nothing to do with the artist, they are great)
* **The Sahara, Outdoor, Coachella, and entrance-adjacent bathrooms are full with undercovers.** Do with that information what you will.
* **Most important tip: enjoy the festival with your eyes and body, not through your phone.** You can always ask your friends for videos later.

Hope this helps! \*\* **Feel free to add more real small hacks \*\*** and see you in 4 months...

Here’s the backstory:

We met through his brother, who’s a good friend of mine, and hit it off. He slid into my DMs last February after moving to London post-breakup and years of traveling. He was dealing with anxiety and adjusting to life here, and I tried to be understanding.

We went on a coffee date, and it was lovely, but soon after, he told me his life was “too busy” to take things further. I appreciated his honesty, even though it hurt. Later, he randomly bought me some food from an Arabic shop (we’re from the same niche country), invited me to his birthday (which I couldn’t attend), and told a friend of mine that I was beautiful but that he couldn’t give 100% to anything due to his anxiety. I thought okay, he’s clearly not in a place for a relationship, so I left him alone.

Then, in November, he slid back into my DMs, and I thought maybe he was in a better headspace. We went on another date, but he had a panic attack after an hour and had to leave. I completely understood because I have bad anxiety myself. He apologized and asked me out for drinks, which turned out to be a really lovely time. We talked about our long-term goals—he wants to move to the countryside, and so do I—and we seemed to really click. We kissed, kept messaging, and I honestly thought this could go somewhere.

The following week, he asked to see me twice, but things started to unravel. He canceled the first date last minute, sending a voice note at 6:30 PM saying he was ill. I had this gut feeling he wasn’t being entirely truthful, and I didn’t want to get my hopes up again, so I preemptively canceled the second date. I told him we should “rain check” because I didn’t want to risk getting sick before my trip, but really, I was just trying to protect myself from being let down again.

We agreed to see each other after the holidays, and during that month apart, he’d message me every few days—not constantly, but enough to keep me engaged. At first, it made me anxious, but I convinced myself I was overthinking since we weren’t even in the same place.

When we got back, he sent me a voice note saying he has feelings for me and thinks I’m beautiful (classic line), but he can’t stop thinking about how our long-term goals don’t align—he wants to live up north, and I want to stay down south. He also admitted he’d been distant, avoiding me like a coward, and knew this would upset me. That part hurt because it felt like he’d been stringing me along while I was questioning everything.

Then, he has the audacity to say he wants to meet for a coffee “to clear the air” because we have good banter and he doesn’t want to lose that.

WTF? Is he just stringing me along, or does he genuinely not know what he wants? It’s also frustrating because everyone keeps saying I’m way out of his league (which I hate because I really did like him), but I’m at the point where I don’t think I can bounce back from this.

I’ve told him I don’t think meeting up would help either of us, but I’m second-guessing myself. Is that the right move? What do you think his intentions are?",0,1736960503.0,AskMenAdvice,14,0.5,False

We went on a coffee date, and it was lovely, but soon after, he told me his life was “too busy” to take things further. I appreciated his honesty, even though it hurt.

We agreed to see each other after the holidays, and during that month apart, he’d message me every few days—not constantly, but enough to keep me engaged. At first, it made me anxious, but I convinced myself I was overthinking since we weren’t even in the same place.

When we got back, he sent me a voice note saying he has feelings for me and thinks I’m beautiful (classic line), but he can’t stop thinking about how our long-term goals don’t align—he wants to live up north, and I want to stay down south. He also admitted he’d been distant, avoiding me like a coward, and knew this would upset me. That part hurt because it felt like he’d been stringing me along while I was questioning everything.

Then, he has the audacity to say he wants to meet for a coffee “to clear the air” because we have good banter and he doesn’t want to lose that.

WTF? Is he just stringing me along, or does he genuinely not know what he wants? It’s also frustrating because everyone keeps saying I’m way out of his league (which I hate because I really did like him), but I’m at the point where I don’t think I can bounce back from this.

I’ve told him I don’t think meeting up would help either of us, but I’m second-guessing myself. Is that the right move? What do you think his intentions are?",1,1736960302.0,AmIOverreacting,2,0.67,False

Scenario 1. It's breakfast time, a person is at home, alone. They crave a glass of apple juice, and drink one. Standard.

Scenario 2. It's breakfast time, a person is at home, alone. They crave a glass of rum, and drink one. This could suggest alcolosim, based on the fact that they are craving and consuming spirits at say 9am.

Scenario 3. It's breakfast time, a person is at home, alone. Let's assume that they do not have a history of drinking rum at breakfastime. They crave a glass of non-alcoholic rum, and drink one. Does this suggest alcolosim like scenario 2, or not, like scenario 1?

Would you view the person in Scenario 3 more similarly to Scenario 2 with the alcoholic rum or Scenario 1 with the apple juice? If Scenario 2, why, if there is no alcohol in the beverage?

ETA: okay same idea but different place. This time the person is on a train and has bought a takeaway coffee. They're adding to it from a bottle they've brought with them and gotten out of their bag. It's a busy commuter train and everyone can see.

Scenario 4: They're adding caramel syrup.

Scenario 5: They're adding alcoholic rum.

Scenario 6: They're adding non-alcoholic rum.

1i21xca,https://www.reddit.com/r/sunlesssea/comments/1i21xca/2024_ultimate_sunless_sea_money_and_progress_guide/,2024 ULTIMATE Sunless Sea Money and Progress guide,"Hey you. Yeah you. Are you tired of spending an hour jumping islands, only to barely break even resupplying and repairing your ship? You fell for the trade meme and sold your soul shipping alcohol, gems and Nescafé Gold across the Zee?

Then you found the right post!

First things first, you need to get into the right mindset. This is a game about a fantasy 1800s Britain so you need three things: SELLING FOREIGN ARTIFACTS, RUTHLESS WILDLIFE EXPLOITATION and NAVAL SUPREMACY.

Starting the game

\-Pick pages bonus if you plan to do a long playthrough. It leads to more stat growth long term by both getting secrets faster and unlocking options in events to gain fragments. It is also generally the hardest stat to raise.

\-If you want to cheese the game, Sell everything except 1 fuel, exchange steamer for the shitty 1 hull boat, buy a fancy gun and crash the ship into the nearest obstacle. Pick the rival option for your new captain, give him the fancy gun and wa-la. Huge firepower upgrade. You may have to repeat this by selling the new expensive gun and upgrading further until you get the fancy gold gun.

\-Pour your secrets into mirrors, then veils. Or vice versa. Depending on preference.

Early game: Exploring and amassing wealth

These places are your early game moneymakers:

\-London: Ask the admiralty for a special assignment and get them the strategic info for 150€. Some are tricky and require additional skills, resources. Once you have enough money to go on two subsequent missions, combine two strategic Infos to a better version before turning them in. This can be done in the cargo hold. Cargo space needed: 0. Unlimited use.

\-London: Work with the blind bruiser and you get a repeating job of smuggling a crate of souls for 200€ profit and fuel/supplies. Dont return without the crate once you got the money, he will fuck you up and disappear. Avoid DEA inspection by returning to London WITHOUT a SAY. Cargo space needed: 1.

\-Visage: Have a SAY(Story awaits you). Go ashore, pick locust mask. Switch with mothman. Go to the temple of apis. Take the bulls blood two times and make notes the third time. Finish the visit. Selling in London gives 250€ for Artifact and Snippet and you get -10 Terror. Cargo space needed: 0. Unlimited use.

\-Polythreme: Free mission to transport 6 stoned guys to London. Have a small crew surplus over 50% in case one has a meltdown. Free 120€. Cargo space needed: 6. Unlimited use.

\-Khans Shadow - Polythreme: Take 1 Hunting trophy and have 1 SAY ready. Exchange Trophy in Khans Shadow for 4 Idols. Exchange Idols in Polythreme into better idols for free. Sell them in London for 100€ a pop. Cargo space needed: 4 per 1 hunting trophy exchanged. Unlimited use.

\-Salt Lions - London: Buy 20 units of eldritch demon stone for 200€, sell them in London for 500€. 200€ investment needed, cargo space needed: 20. Limited use.

\-Mangrove College/Melting Islands: Grab a free passenger there to drop off for 100-120€ depending on destination. Cargo space needed: 1. Unlimited use.

These places are useful to drop by, if near your intended route

\-Alcaeus-Class Corvette: Not a place, but an enemy. You see it, you kill it. Stick to its tail and it can't shoot you, shoot it from behind until its dead. Rescue the captain EVERY TIME personally. After a few rescues, meet the captain in Gaiders Mourn for free stats, have a tattoo already by this point. Continue sinking the ship always afterwards. Pirate based economy. Gain: 100-600€, Fuel, Supplies, random loot. Unlimited use.

\-Frostfound: Free 1 fuel 1 supply -10 terror with 1 SAY and alright port report.

\-Aestival: Chance to get massive free supplies with a SAY, good port report.

\-Khans Shadow: Great port report, cheap(ish) fuel at 15€.

\-Mangrove College: Alright free supply amount with SAY.

\-Mount Palmerston: Alright port report and cheap fuel, cheaper than in London at 9€.

If you plan your trip with that info in mind, you can easily make 1000€ profit early game per trip, including port reports. The next logical question is...

Midgame: Upgrades and what ship to buy.

Focus on unlocking the submarine. Its worth it.

Upgrades: Get the best gun from the London vendor. Once you have a front gun slot, buy the gold gun shooting torpedos with the 8 second stun on hit. Get the Clay Men Upgrade from Polythreme. Get the avid suppressor once you have an aft slot. Dont upgrade the engine, buy a ship with an aft slot and just go full power with base engine and avid supressor until you follow the tireless mechanic questline to its end. Dont buy a light, follow the irrepressible canoneers storyline and place the half finished product in the bridge slot. Dont finish the questline until you have fuck you money, the bridge slot upgrade is unironically better than the final reward.

What ship to get: Lets pour a glass for all Zailors who fell for the trade meme and bought the freighter.

Fact: Steamer<Freighter<Corvette<Frigate=Dreadnought. I WILL FIGHT YOU.

THE TRADE MEME: You need 7000 to exchange the steamer for the freighter. Much better than the 14000 needed for the frigate right? WRONG. You see, im an economics expert. And the 120 Cargo slots the freighter comes with start out EMPTY. So you also need cash to buy trade goods. Lets look at a good trade route:

Buy Sapphire Crates in Port Carnelian for 86€ and sell them in the Chelonate for 99€ for a 13€ profit per crate. Wow, at 100 crates its like 1300 Profit! WRONG. First, you most likely can only carry around 80-90 per trip depending on your fuel/supply management and what islands are between the both points.

Second, you gain a massive amount of terror during the long trip since the freighter cant fight for shit. And fighting reduces terror! So subtract money for terror reduction.

Third, you get bored running the same route over and over. And since the freighter guzzles massive amounts of fuel and supplies, making detours kinda makes the trade thing pointless.

Fourth and the most important point: To buy 90 crates of sapphires you need an additional 7400€!

""B-But muh coffee run to vienna..."" Shut up! Also around 4000€ additional investment and it is a limited opportunity.

So in addition to the 7000€ needed to buy the freighter, you also need 5000-8000€ to buy trade goods, fuel, supplies, crew and the avid suppressor. So around 14000. The price of getting the frigate outright.

WHY IS THE FRIGATE/CORVETTE BETTER? Combat. Combat is the moneymaker that separates earlygame from mid/endgame. It can even be argued that the natural progression of ships is Steamer-Corvette-Frigate because the second gun slot is just SOOO good.

\-Second gun slot is like the moment the first human decided to sharpen a stick. Congratulations, you have won the arms race of the Zee. The second gun slot, combined with the stunning torpedo gun and a mirror skill of around 50-60 allows you to 1v1 everything in the game. You go from screaming ""WHAT IS THIS"" and running away, to seeing a giant underwater deathspider and wondering what awesome loot it will drop (The loot is great, kill it).

\-Killing enemies reduces terror. Nothing to add here.

\-Killing enemies between islands helps you reach the next port with a SAY since they are time based.

\-Killing enemies rewards you with high value loot and stats, most of which dont even take up a cargo hold. Hear that? Who cares that the Corvette only has 30 Cargo slots, when the artifacts or hunting trophies you get take up no space? Or just 1 space like the flukecore you sell for 500.

Choosing the freighter over even the corvette makes you miss out on all the enemies you pass by wthout being able to fight them. This is why it is a trap choice.  Enemies are resources to harvest on the way and a freighter cant do that.

Mid-/Endgame: Mass depletion of marine life

In addition to the earlygame moneymakers and the money you earn by learning the game and completing quests, once you have your ship with a second gun slot you hunt down high value prey. You should look out for these.

\-Lifeberg: Pick the treasure option for high chance of hunting trophies and artifacts. Possible gain of 100-400 per kill

\-Flukes (Sea urchins). Killing a giant fluke gives you 3 (THREE) Secrets and a fluke core you sell for 500 bucks. Imagine being a Freightercel and missing out on that one. Undersea flukes give 1 secret afaik, so the giant ones on the surface are better.

\-Undersea spider that appears once you have high enough terror. You'll hear it once you do. Kill it. Do it.

\-Tree of life: Pick the second option that gives you a thing you can sell for 1000€

\-Almost all other marine life is worth killing if spotted, the top ones are worth actively seeking out. Enemy surface ships are less worth it, besides the aforementioned Alcaeus class Corvette and a particular ship around the Chelonate (You will know when you see it). Underzee ships are different, they drop some good stuff, but often require a stat check.

So thats basically it. Once you reached this point, you are a seasoned ecplorer and probanly can take on any task given to you. A switch to a Dreadnought is not needed, but can make certain material hauling objectives easier. But keep in mind that it will guzzle fuel and supplies because of the higher weight and crew.

Also, if you want to do a trade playthrough, dont be discouraged. Its not optimal play, yes, but if you like the idea of a trader trying to make profit in cursed waters - feel free! Here are some routes.

\-Coffee to vienna

\-Wine to Godfall

\-Wine-Sapphires route that I mentioned earlier.

\-Coffee to Silk exchange in Irem then back to London.

\-Bying supplies on surface and selling it to the nuns on the church island

TLDR: I'd really appreciate some thoughts on which of the 2 rigs below would be a better pick? If you own either of these, please share your thoughts!! I know both of these are pricey, so I am trying to be thoughtful about value/price.

Context:

This will be my first sim racing setup. I'll be using the Logitech Pro Wheel + Pedals. I was hoping to maybe use Simagic but I heard the cortex converter doesn't work well for GT7.

Initially, I was leaning towards the trophy, but I then found out about the F1 instinct and it peaked my interest. Both are 599 USD / 799 CAD.

A full out 80/20 is not possible, I have kids and I use a living room to play GT7. I need to be able to move the rig around as I wish, not too far, but it needs to be movable. I added a pic of where the sim rig will be (coffee table has to go!) The TV is around 30 inches off the floor.

Some thoughts / concerns:

* I heard the trophy is solid but some people complained about the seat ripping, minimal flex
* The instinct F1 looks like ""more rig for the money"" as the seat is made of metal and it seems like the rig has more adjustability in general - however it looks less ""movable"" of course and given how it is built, I believe there will be more flex in general, specially on the wheelbase
* For both of these, I am concerned about the wheel + wheelbase being in my POV and blocking the screen

F1 dimensions (LxWxH) 150 x 60 x 87 cm | 59,06 x 23,62 x 34,25

Trophy dimensions (LxWxH) 140 x 58 x 100 cm | 55,12 x 22,83 x 39,37

What do you guys think is the best seat out of these 2? Do you have experience with them? If yes, is there too much flex? any other concerns you may have? Any info is welcome!

Thank you

I know that they might be busy with their own families now, but I don't want to embarrass myself being as  pushy or look like the needy or the one who has nothing to do so I will be the one calling them to meet.

With the last experience of ingratitude for the gifts I brought them, and also how one of them was trying to get me into deceiving one of his own friends (both stories I wrote about in two different posts) I started to think that I should review my friendship with these close friends. I believe a lot in family and friends relationships, but I think I should review this belief I have. I don't mean cutting ties with them friends altogether, but keep it minimum to occasions only maybe. I think that's how they might be looking at our friendship at the end.

What do you guys think? Should I stop acting as if our friendship should be as strong as it used to be? Should I review my beliefs? Should I maybe get over my friends altogether? I started thinking seriously about getting married, so maybe I should be just like them, get married and forget about them? What are your suggestions?",1,1736959356.0,Tunisia,1,1.0,False

I’ve tried almost every hotel and restaurant in Kannur, Thalassery, Thaliparamba, etc., and I used to hype up Kannur’s food scene to my friends from other states and abroad. But now, I feel like the charm is fading.

Everywhere I go, the food tastes bland or generic, and even the tea spots don’t seem to hit the mark. Most places are either overhyped or just average, and I miss finding a proper “Naadan Hotel” that serves authentic snacks (kadi), good biriyani, quality meat dishes, and a satisfying cup of tea.

Here are my current go-to spots:

Onakkan Bharathi - for chops and puttu, though the tea and coffee quality has dropped lately.

Soft - biriyani is decent.

Bakerboys - puffs and tea.

Some hotels in Palayad - Kadambur - Muzhapilangad: A few good places for tea and ennakkadis.

Beyond this, everything feels repetitive—especially Arabian food, where everything tastes the same.

Does anyone know of hidden gems or “Naadan” spots in Kannur that offer authentic snacks, flavorful biriyani, quality meat dishes, or even just a great cup of tea? I’m open to exploring anything that captures the real essence of our cuisine.

They were individual little coffee cakes.  I've bought the same product in the past, so I had faith that this was something i wanted again.

When they arrived, they seemed harder than what I'd had in the past.  Borderline stale.

Checking the package, I saw that they had sold these cakes right around the sell-by date.  So I checked the negative reviews, and this is apparently their regular practice -- selling online to keep from tossing the product in the dumpster.

I tried to get a refund, but Amazon says this product is ineligible for returns and refunds, but didn't say why.  All I could do was leave reviews.  Amazon's support was worthless.  I even contacted the manufacturer, since they might have some control over who sells their products, and all they did was recommend that I buy directly from them in the future.  I posted on r/amazon, and mods immediately removed my post.

This isn't a big financial hit for me, but they're scamming people who don't have the opportunity to check the freshness date at the point of purchase.  They shouldn't be allowed to do this.

1i21g26,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1i21g26/reassurance_that_no_contact_is_the_right_approach/,"Reassurance that ""no contact"" is the right approach for me. ","Hi everyone! I (27M) have been reading here for a few months (10/27 DDay) since the break-up with my ex (28F). I have appreciated all the advice and support I have seen in these forums. This period has been the hardest in my life, for sure, so hear I am writing out my thoughts. In truth, I actually don't need/expect you to read this. This is therapeutic for me to write it out.

**Right now, I am having a** ***very*** **hard time not reaching out to my ex, K, and would love your thoughts/advice or reassurances if I am handling this right.**

**Background:**

K and I have been friends for seven years, were a couple for five years, and lived together for about 4.5 (COVID sped the timeline up!). From the moment I met K, I knew she was special and wanted to be with her. I fell in love with her early on and when she fell in love with me (it took a bit longer), she fell hard. Our spark was so intense and we connected on every. single. level.

Over the first three 3-4 years of our relationship, we remained strong and committed to each other. Not only were we each other's romantic partners, but we were each other's best friends. Our personalities jived, our strengths complimented each other, and our future hopes and dreams were aligned. Our families became intertwined and in Summer 2023 (around 3.5 years dating), after many conversations, we committed to each other to get married. We picked a ring, I bought the ring. But the mutual agreement was that we would hide away the ring, save it, until we both finished Graduate School about a year later when we would go public. This secret engagement was just for us.

Unfortunately, it was soon after this things started to go down hill. I broke my foot pretty badly, had to get surgery and was unable to walk/stand without a fair amount of discomfort, let alone exercise. It has gotten better, but still limits my activity today. On top of that, in December of 2023, I got a bad bout of COVID and ended up dealing with a chronic migraine more more than six months.  As a result, throughout our last 1.5 years together, I gained a decent amount of weight and started experiencing heightened episodes of depression and anxiety. I was/am unhappy with the state of myself.

My depression and anxiety came home with me, compounded by the stress of work. We both work in demanding jobs in Government/politics and the landscape is an anxiety inducing hellscape. This stress weighed heavily on us and we both talked a lot about it. Both K and I resolved to get out of this field soon, but kept kicking it down the road due constant promotions and more money (should be a good thing, right!?). We kept telling ourselves that we could do it a *little* longer. At least until she finished graduate school.

Throughout all of 2024, I was badly depressed and very anxious every day. K unfortunately bore the brunt of my struggles. I was sad, distant, and despite her best efforts, was not getting better. I learned throughout this process that depression and anxiety is contagious. K started facing her own struggles. (Since the breakup, I have finally started going to weekly therapy...wish I had started sooner). She unfortunately, has not. I have seen her spiraling worse than me recently.

In the final months of our relationship, we had open conversations about how we couldn't live this way forever, but I never felt like our relationship was on the chopping block. Our jobs and where we lived certainly were, though. I always had hope we would get through this hard time. I mean, it was an election year, we were finishing grad school.

K graduated in August '24. We again talked about our intentions to get married, and I start preparing for a proposal in the winter. I did notice at the time there wasn't as much enthusiasm as when we had talked in the past.

About this time, K starts talking more about this guy at work. He was relatively new and she would tell me some of the stories of how he handled their boss and some of the crazy shit going on in his own family. It was interesting and all seemed harmless. Honestly, I was happy to hear she had a friend in the office. At one point they hung out at a pub on a Saturday night from 8-midnight. In the busy pre-election season, I didn't think too much of it...I've had my own fair share of late night sessions and he's significantly older and married with kids. But I did express my mild discomfort in how late it went. She reassured me I had nothing to worry about. I trusted her.

**D-Day,** 10/27. K comes home from a family visit and immediately says that we are breaking up. Using language like ""I can't be together right now"" or ""I can't imagine any future for myself and need to discover what I want and need."" I asked to go to counseling. Essentially begged to even a single time to help me understand her decision. I ask her if I should move out ASAP. She says no ""I want you to stay here, at least through the election (11/5), about 10 days away.

Throughout these 10 days in purgatory I felt like K and I reconnected more than we had recently. We were open, loving, and supportive (but I stayed in the guest bedroom the whole time). But the entire, time, she remained firm that she needed to break up. Finally, the election and I decide I have to leave. If she doesn't want to reconcile, I needed to take care of myself. She breaks down tells me I can stay, but again, we need to break up. As I go, tells me she loves me.

For the rest of November and early December, K and I keep in good touch. Things feel like we're still a couple... We went out to dinner a couple times, grabbed coffee, went to a movie, a Christmas concert, and had a lot of intimate conversations. She also does weird things like clean my parents' car while we're out of town and set-up a mini Christmas tree with our couples ornaments in the room I am staying at my parents' (she had/has a key to my parents' house). Throughout this entire time, she tells me she's going through a crisis, admitting how much she hates herself and how sad she is every single day. I do my best to support her, holding her closely in her most vulnerable moments. I talk with her mom and best friend(s) to make sure she gets the support she needs as I start pulling away.

At this point, I learned that whenever I was not with K, she was spending most of her time with her one coworker (she never stopped sharing her location with me. On his second marriage with one kid each, I learn through friends that he is going through his own divorce. After nearly two months in limbo, I decide to get my stuff out of the apartment, despite K telling my I didn't have to. I ask again if we can try reconcile, she says no and no to counseling. While cleaning my stuff out, I find a love note written by her coworker to K dated **one day after K and my breakup.** Acknowledging the ""loss they are both going through"" but how grateful he was for her. This emotionally wrecks me.

When I told her I knew about her and her coworker, she broke down and apologized. Saying that she ""just needed support"" after the break up and that ""she did right by me"" because nothing happened before we broke up. It still feels like I have been cheated on. She tells me ""I love you unconditionally, but I can't be with you."" She also admitted that she struggled in our relationship because it felt so platonic lately and that she ""lost feeling."" I mean, that makes sense...I've been depressed. But I wish we could have talked about this sooner. I didn't want to lose our physical intimacy...I've just been struggling. I should have sought help sooner. But also, throughout the last year, she admitted that her new hormonal birth control pill was killing her libido....So, I don't think this is all on me. I thought we were both having our own issues we were working through. Instead, this new fling with her coworker seems to be enough to overcome her birth control side affects that used to rationalize our lower intimacy throughout the last year...  
At this meeting, I tell her this is the last time I will ask her to get back together and the ball is in her court. She says she still can't get back together. I have not asked her to reconcile or do anything for me since. We then go about week without talking/messaging.

On December 19th, K calls me and says she wants to see me and asks to go on a drive. I agree. Not much new here, but she ends the night by kissing me and saying that she loves me. She still doesn't mention anything reconciliation. I ask for no contact the next day day. She agrees, but continues to send me heartfelt messages every. single. day. Saying things like ""you were the most important person in my life in 2024"" and ""even if we don't talk for 60 years, you would still be one of the most important people in my life."" There are plenty more where that came from...

Finally, on New Year's Eve I tell her I will stop responding because it's too hard for me. I have heard from her only a handful of times since then. Each message seems less and less loving. More sterile. It hurts every time I get something. I have only responded when it is a logistical question....

Most recently, she said ""it would be helpful to talk some time"" and that she has a Christmas gift from her heart she would like to give me. I don't know what to do. If there is a chance we even explore reconciliation, I would. I love her and miss her. Hell, I don't even know if it's what I want anymore after everything! But more than anything, I would love more closure. I can't help but think that this largely a result of outside circumstances and each of our own mental health crises. But at the same time, she has never wavered from her ""we need to break up"" stance.

All said, I have been proud of myself in these past 2.5 months. I have reconnected with several old friends, spent time with my mom, dad, and sister, and have gotten into the best shape I have been in years! Wild. Despite all this, my heart hurts and I miss K more than anything. My friends and family say do not see her as in their mind, she dumped me to be with this new guy (they are still seeing each other in secret, btw...I think only the three of us know since it would be a bit of a political scandal for the guy in particular). But I am conflicted...I feel like K is also a victim here. I can't help but think this guy is preying on her vulnerability.

'He might need to go on his own this morning. It's cold out, and I'm nice and warm in this sleeping bag. And I'm in no hurry.'

I'll wake up an hour or more early when I have a job just to ease into my morning with a calmly drunk cup of coffee and a cigarette or two.

He gets his stuff together and moved. Waits on me for a few. Gear on. We bail out. Coffee. Library.

Around noon he takes off for the feed. I had some money come in. I think... you guessed it, 'Pizza' Find a cheap place nearby on maps. Walk three miles round trip to pull a $20 out of my account. He's broke and mentioned he might have to figure out bus fare to do what he's gotta do. I'm happy to hook him up with that if he needs it. Back past library to pizza place.

Look at sign. ""Closed Tuesday"" 'Fuck! I really wanted a slice and a soda.' Off to store near library to rustle up lunch. Three lunchable type things, two bananas, orange soda. Back to library. Eat outside on some steps.

""I thought you might've hopped a train out of here."" ""Nah. I was after pizza. Place was closed when I got there."" ""Oh that sucks!"" ""Yeah. I got bus fare if you need it."" ""Cool! Thanks!"" ""No worries."" Relay my adventure. We both laugh at my misfortune.

""The church with the cold weather shelter is serving dinner at five. There's another at seven at the YMCA that is not to be missed."" ""Nice!"" 

At a quarter to five we hit the park. Delicious homemade chilli over rice with saltines. They have chairs setup. They bring the food to us. A little bit of a mild sermon first. Mainly, ""If you want Jesus in your life come talk to us."" Much quieter this time. Several of their people handing us Twinkies or chocolate cupcakes. It was so good I got seconds.

Back to library to warm up and miss sermon at the Y. Out to the Y, which happens to be close to camp. 'Nice!' Chicken pot pie, banquet style in large pans. Sweet tea, Kool aid, and water. Three homemade desserts, and other desserts being passed out. They bring it to us, but we're a few minutes late.

Find a couple seats. Gear down times two. Over to get food.

Get entree first. Get told, ""We usually bring it to you and don't have people coming up here to get it."" We apologize and explain we're late and didn't want to miss it. Over to desserts.

My time in South Carolina living with my friend who is a descendant of one of the first European families to be dropped off south of Charleston kicks in. ""Is that nanner puddin'?"" The woman smiles. ""I love nanner puddin'!"" I can tell from a distance this isn't just the usual cheap version of vanilla pudding 'Nilla Wafers and sliced bananas. 'Oh this is gonna be good!' She scoops some onto a small plate for me, adds a little extra. I grab a slice of chocolate cake and take my second dinner back to the table. Back for sweet tea and Kool aid.

I love sweet tea. I typically drink about 98% water with the occasional soda, juice, or Powerade thrown in for flavor. I wasn't feeling the sweet tea when I drank it. Finished it anyway. The Kool aid hit the spot for some reason. Had another when they brought it around.

At this point I'm already full. I dig the chicken and crust out and eat that. The nanner puddin' has a real crust similar to 'Nilla Wafers, but better. I barely got the chocolate cake down. Too full.

Around here, at least on Tuesday night, they feed you and start breaking down first chance they get. They're not pushy about it, but they're not looking to let you hang out for very long. I completely understand. It's cold. It's dark. I'm sure there's some other reason I don't realize. 

Most of the homebums aren't out.

 The salvation army, which here is the shittiest shelter I've ever heard about, doing some fucked up things, has them in by 3:30pm. No going back out or you lose your bed. No smoking. If you're diabetic you get one peanut butter sandwich at 10:30pm. Back out at five in the morning. Rain or shine. Freezing or not. Nothing's open in Mobile at that hour except a Hardy's, and they're not having bums hanging out. I've heard a lot of other bad things about the place from guys who've been there, including my new friend.

We head back towards camp. Him, ""I'm probably gonna have to have you hold a flashlight for me when we get back. This one's about dead."" ""No problem."" 

We walk into the woods in the dark, dodging puddles and bushwacking as we go. Back into our camp.

Flashlight in hand lighting up his area, ""Man, do what you gotta do, but I can't remember the last time I was this full. I've been setting up my tent at sunset and climbing in. It's past my bed time."" ""I'm on it."" And he was. He's pretty high IQ too. We're exactly one month apart in age. He's efficient like I am. ""I'm good."" He's still putting the last few things he's got in bags in a tiny tent he found out in the woods. I'm finishing a cigarette anyway, and I'm not an asshole, so I hang until he's got everything squared away. ""Alright man, see you in the morning.""

I think you forgot about me. I think you found someone else. And I think I'm happy for you. Yet there's this bitter sting in my chest when I say that, that tells me that I still wanted it to be me.

Sure, I feel stupid. I know l'm naive. I keep telling myself that it was just the impossibility of us, that I just romanticized us. Knowing that our time is short.
Knowing what you've done, what we did to hurt each other. Beneath the sensibilities of hindsight, of being older and wiser, I still wanted you just as much as I did. I guess I haven't changed that much.

I still miss us, sometimes - mental replays of romanticized memories of when we were together.
Wishing I knew the last time was the last, that I kissed you harder than I did and that I said all the things I felt were too early to say.

I thought about when we meet nowadays, if we ever do, what l'd tell you about my life and what you'd say. But then I realize that I don't remember your voice as well as I did. It'd probably fade from my memory completely, eventually.

I know you don't believe in fate or miracles, but if you're gonna be the one that got away, then at least give me this — let's run into each other again someday. I'd love to get a coffee with you. Just to hear you talk again ❤️",2,1736958910.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

I (27M) married my (28F) wife last year after being together for around 3 years.  
  
For context, i have studied abroad, where i met her, then came back home, i had the choice of either finishing higher education, or get a job and get married.  
But after some circumstances, i ended up great job, and started up my life.   
Our plan was to get married then get a spouse visa to move to her country (different than where i studied).  
  
I have been in her country for around 8 months, and mind you there is a Law basically prohibiting me from working the first 6 months here, and i had to learn the hard way because i did land a decent job after being here for like 2 months, but got laid off a week later since they couldn't get a background check on me, because i basically did not exist in the records.  
I have been applying everywhere ever since, even to low entry level jobs in hope to hear back from something, anything.

Don't get me wrong, we're not struggling, we currently have our own place in her mother's house (great lady, i love her) and are taken very well care of.  
Our plan is to save up for a house deposit and move out ASAP.

It was great at first, my wife is loving and caring, and i try my absolute best to reciprocate and always be there for her as i should.  
  
But we fight a lot for absolutely no reason, like it would be about some random BS like a cup of coffee staying overnight on my desk or something, which somehow leads to talks about the big issues, namely trust and respect.  
She had had some issues and traumas that i THOUGHT i helped her working through, but they always keep coming back even with all the reassurance that i give her.  
And what ticks me off the most, is that there is never any kind of support from her side, like i could tell her my deepest desires and where i would want to be in the future, and what i want to accomplish, and she would just find something to critique in those hopes and dreams.  
  
I never insult her, but this woman has such a foul mouth that i was not aware of, and she CANNOT have a civilized conversation without directly insulting me, and when i bring it up she says ""You were being condescending to me"".  
Since when did expressing oneself become being condescending? even so, since when does it give anybody the right to be agressive and insult the only person that's gonna be there for you in your future?

I love her and treat her well, i ordered 2 months prior multiple presents for her birthday that's coming, and I swear to you, i have never been the one to initiate any arguments with her ever since i got here, i'm just trying to get by and embetter our lives, along with the crushing weight of all my responsabilities, shortcomings, and the fleeting thought of rushing and having commited a grave mistake.  
I'm getting more depressed day by day, that i started waking up at 3 in the afternoon and spending my whole day online.

As i have mentionned before, i am very new in this country, i have no close friends of family that i can go to and talk about my situation, and i don't want to bring anybody of her family into this issue, because deep down both me and her know how irrational she is, and that nobody will be on her side, so i don't want to bring any shame towards her or anything.

So here i am, coming to you for advice  
i'm honestly tired of being treated like a lap dog.  
  
What can i do to save this and make it better? ",1,1736958905.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False

I'm searching for a passionate and creative **female writing partner** to embark on a long-term, immersive roleplay about everyone's favorite cinnamon roll hero, Izuku Midoriya, and the radiant Ochaco Uraraka. If you’re a fan of heartfelt romances, detailed storytelling, and exploring the day-to-day life of heroes in a post-war world, this might be just the roleplay for us!

# The Plot:

Our story begins after Izuku Midoriya, now Japan’s Number One Hero and the new Symbol of Peace, has defeated All For One, Tomura Shigaraki, and the Paranormal Liberation Front. With the world saved and his heroic legacy cemented, Izuku now faces a new, daunting challenge: love.

The roleplay will follow:

1. **Their first date**—a sweet and awkward outing where both struggle to balance their blossoming feelings and heroic responsibilities.
2. **The proposal and wedding**—filled with emotional moments, funny mishaps, and a heartwarming union of two heroes who’ve been through thick and thin together.
3. **Married life**—from balancing hero duties to navigating everyday challenges, including having and raising a big family. Think slice-of-life, with a touch of humor, drama, and lots of tender moments.

I’m open to expanding the story with ideas you’d like to explore, whether it’s introducing new villains, diving into hero politics, or incorporating fluff-filled family adventures. Let’s brainstorm together to make this story truly ours!

* **Novella-style writing:** I love diving into detailed, descriptive posts that bring our world to life. My typical reply length ranges from 500-1,500 words, depending on the scene.
* **Third-person perspective:** This format helps maintain a cinematic, story-driven feel.
* **Romance and slice-of-life vibes:** I want to create a cozy yet dynamic story where we explore the joys and challenges of being heroes and lovers.
* **Collaboration:** Your input is vital! I want us both to have fun and shape the plot together.

# About Me:

* **12 years of roleplaying experience:** I’ve explored many genres, but slice-of-life and romance are my bread and butter.
* **Flexible and open-minded:** I’m happy to tweak or add elements to the story—your creativity is welcome here!
* **Fun fact:** I’m a sucker for writing heartfelt confessions, tear-jerking moments, and characters who wear their hearts on their sleeves.
* **Timezone:** I’m in Sydney (AEST) but can adapt to your schedule for regular replies.

# Writing Sample:

Here’s a snippet of my portrayal of Izuku Midoriya to give you an idea of my writing style:

>Izuku Midoriya sat at a small table near the corner of the café, his leg bouncing nervously under the table as he adjusted his tie for the third time in ten minutes. The tie was forest green, a deliberate choice to match his hero costume’s colors, though now he worried it might seem too obvious. ""Maybe I should’ve gone with blue instead,"" he muttered under his breath, rubbing the back of his neck as his gaze darted to the door for the tenth time.

>The aroma of fresh coffee and pastries hung in the air, blending with the soft hum of conversation around him. It should have been comforting, but Izuku couldn’t quiet the whirlwind in his mind. His notebook, tucked neatly in his bag, felt heavier than usual. He’d considered taking it out to jot down strategies for hero work—anything to calm his nerves—but dismissed the idea immediately. This wasn’t a mission briefing or a training session. This was a *date.*

>A date with Ochaco.

>His face flushed at the thought, his freckled cheeks burning like they were in direct sunlight. “Get it together, Midoriya,” he whispered, gripping the edge of the table. “You’ve faced villains, life-or-death situations, even All For One. You can handle one date without—”

>The soft chime of the doorbell interrupted his self-coaching, and his heart skipped a beat. His emerald eyes shot up as the door swung open, and there she was. Ochaco Uraraka. Her brown hair seemed to glow in the afternoon light, her warm smile instantly cutting through the storm of his overthinking.

>Izuku froze for a split second before jumping to his feet, nearly knocking over his chair in the process. His hands flailed slightly as he tried to steady it, but his focus was entirely on her. “O-Ochaco! Hi!” His voice cracked just enough to make him wince internally, but he forced a smile, his palms already sweaty.

>She stepped closer, and for a moment, it felt like the world blurred around her. Her casual outfit suited her so perfectly that Izuku forgot how to breathe. “You look... amazing,” he blurted, the words tumbling out before he could think to stop them. His face turned crimson immediately, his hands now gripping the back of his chair like it was his only lifeline.

>Somewhere in the back of his mind, a little voice scolded him. *Too much, too fast, calm down!* But another part of him—a braver, quieter part—was just happy she was there.

1i21dnl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i21dnl,Introducing Bird & Bear Coffee Company ☕️ Coffee meetup on MLK Monday at their roastery?,"My friend and I are visiting SF from OC. We found this adorable garage cafe in SF! It’s Bird & Bear Coffee Company, named after the founder’s twin kids.

When I’m in town, I occasionally host small coffee gatherings. After having a wonderful chat with the owner, we thought it would be fun to try it here in SF Bay Area as well.

On MLK Monday 1/20, we are going to meet Bird & Bear’s coffee roastery in Oakland. Since they operate their store based off of their home garage, we decided to move to their roasting facility where they have more space available.

* When: MLK Monday 1/20, 11:00 am - 12:30 pm
* Where: Bird & Bear Coffee Company Roastery in Oakland

75-minutes coffee gathering that includes —

* Private coffee roastery tour
* Guided coffee cupping experience
* Led by Dan, co-founder of Bird & Bear Coffee Company

For those who are new to coffee cupping, it is a method for evaluating and tasting coffee that involves —

* 👀 Observing: Looking at the green beans for defects and the roasted beans
* 👃 Smelling: Noticing the coffee’s aroma
* 👅 Tasting: Sampling the coffee to experience its flavors and notes

Coffee cupping is a professional practice, but anyone can do it. It’s a great way to: develop your sense of taste, learn what coffees you like best, and share your thoughts with others.

When enjoying coffee, we often try one full cup at a time and rarely get a chance to compare different types of beans. It will be a fun and unique opportunity to step into coffee roasting facility’s behind the scene and learn how coffee professionals enjoy their coffee.

Participation: $50 per person

If anyone who wants to purchase beans to repeat quality coffee experience at home, Dan will offer 10% discount on your onsite purchase.

Most days I’d say I’m a 5, if I put in the effort and wear one of my better fits I’d say 6 pushing 7. I’ve got a few extra pounds round my gut, 175 and 5’10”, but you can tell I go to the gym sometimes. Face isn’t carved from marble, but friends say I’m handsome. People say I’m charming and approachable, even if I’m a bit awkward. 

What I’m getting at is I’m just a normal ass guy. 

This is a huge reason I tend to err on the side of caution when it comes to flirting. Plenty of times I’ve thought that someone might be, but I usually assume they’re just being nice. 

I.e; 

new friend stole a sip of my drink and pulled me on to the dance floor away from the group. I moved some hair out of her face, and she just smiled and laughed.  Met her boyfriend I was unaware of a week later.

Girl I’d met like once before picked me out of a crowd at a bar and came over to say hi, completely ignoring my friend next to me. Also had a boyfriend.

Friend I’ve known since college always playfully teases me at parties and we have fake beef. Never hang out outside of group events though.

Got fitted for a tux, lady taking measurements was very friendly and giggly. Messed my name up, made an odd joke about “maybe needing (how she messed my name up) in her life”. Kept stumbling over her words.

These are just the ones that stick out. Plenty of small interactions other than those. Catching someone’s eyes at a concert, “I like your shirt” at a coffee shop, asking me to make them a drink at parties, little things that I usually take at face value. 

All this to say I’m fairly certain that I’m hardly ever hit on, as I find myself average and have never had a clear “I’m into you”. I know people ARE theoretically into me after being in a LTR and using dating apps, in practice though I’m clueless.

The rest of the weekend was a haze—texts from my friends, my mom reminding me to finish my chores, even Kareem sending memes in our group chat. But none of it broke through the wall of emotions that had been building since Friday night.

By Monday, I was no closer to figuring out how I felt. Excited? Nervous? Terrified? Probably all of the above.
Walking into school that morning, I felt the familiar weight of eyes on me. It wasn’t just the usual stares from underclassmen or teachers giving me their “student-athlete” nods. No, this was different. People were whispering.
“Yo, Ahmed!” Sam called from the front steps.
I plastered on a neutral expression and walked over. He was leaning against the railing, a coffee in one hand and his phone in the other.

“Sup,” I muttered, shoving my hands into my pockets.

“Man, where were you this weekend? Group chat’s been blowing up about you and Diego.”

My stomach tightened. “What about it?”

Sam smirked. “Word is you went full UFC on him in the bathroom. Teachers won’t say why, but Diego’s got a black eye, and you’re walking around like you just won the heavyweight title.”

I shrugged. “He deserved it.”

Sam raised an eyebrow. “So it’s true? Damn. What’d he do?”

I didn’t answer. My jaw clenched, and I could feel the heat rising in my chest again, the memory of Malik’s terrified expression flashing in my mind.

Sam whistled. “Yo, you’re serious. Whatever it was, it must’ve been bad. Diego’s been running his mouth about you all weekend. You might want to—”

He trailed off, his eyes flicking past me. I turned and saw Malik walking toward us, his pink sweater replaced by a soft cream-colored hoodie. He looked calm, but I caught the briefest flicker of hesitation in his eyes when he saw me.

“Hey,” Malik said, his voice light but cautious.

“Hey,” I replied, my chest tightening.
Sam glanced between us, his smirk fading as he pieced something together. “Alright, I’ll catch you later, Ahmed.” He gave me a pointed look before strolling off.
Malik shifted on his feet, his hands tucked into the front pocket of his hoodie. “Can we talk?”
I nodded, motioning toward the quieter side of the courtyard. We walked in silence until we were out of earshot from the other students.
“I’m sorry,” Malik said, his voice barely above a whisper.

“For what?” I asked, genuinely confused.

“For dragging you into my mess,” he said, looking down at his shoes. “You didn’t have to fight Diego. You could’ve just walked away.”
“Walk away?” My voice rose, and Malik flinched slightly. I took a deep breath, forcing myself to calm down. “I couldn’t just stand there and do nothing. You think I’d let him treat you like that?”
Malik looked up, his eyes shimmering with unshed tears. “Most people would’ve.”
“Well, I’m not most people,” I said firmly. “You don’t deserve to be treated like that, Malik. Nobody does.”
He blinked, and for a moment, I thought he was going to cry. But then he smiled—a small, genuine smile that made my chest ache.
“Thank you,” he said softly.

We stood there for a moment, the tension between us thick but not uncomfortable.

“Are you okay?” I asked finally.
Malik nodded. “Better now.” He hesitated before adding, “But… people are talking, Ahmed. About Friday. About us.”
I frowned. “Let them talk. I don’t care.”
“You should,” he said, his voice tinged with worry. “This isn’t just gossip. Diego’s been telling everyone you’re… you know.”
“That I’m what?”
Malik hesitated, then said quietly, “That you’re into me.”
The words hit like a freight train. My stomach flipped, and for a moment, I couldn’t breathe.
“And if I am?” I said before I could stop myself.
Malik’s eyes widened, his cheeks flushing pink. “You… you mean that?”
I swallowed hard, the weight of the moment pressing down on me. “I don’t know what I mean,” I admitted. “I just know that I care about you, Malik. More than I probably should.”
The silence that followed was deafening. Malik stared at me, his expression unreadable. Then, slowly, he reached out and took my hand.
“You don’t have to figure it all out right now,” he said, his voice gentle. “But… I’m here. If you want to talk. Or anything.”

I nodded, my throat too tight to speak.
The bell rang, breaking the moment. Malik let go of my hand, but his gaze lingered.
“See you in class,” he said, turning and walking away.
I stood there, watching him go, my heart pounding in my chest.

 Monday hit hard.

Diego was back.
He strolled into school like nothing had happened, his busted lip and black eye doing nothing to wipe the smug look off his face. Word spread fast that his parents had bailed him out, pulling enough strings to keep him out of trouble.
And Diego wasn’t backing down.
By lunch, the rumors had grown louder. Everyone seemed to know about the fight in the bathroom, and Diego was milking it for all it was worth, telling anyone who’d listen that I had a thing for Malik.

“Yo, Ahmed!” Diego called as I passed him in the hallway. He leaned against a locker, his arms crossed and that infuriating smirk plastered across his face. “Still playing hero for your little boyfriend? How cute.”

I ignored him, my fists clenched at my sides.
“That’s right. Walk away,” he sneered. “Can’t finish what you started, huh?”
It took everything in me not to turn around and wipe that look off his face, but I kept walking. Malik didn’t need me starting another fight.
By the time the school-wide assembly rolled around, I was wound so tight I could barely focus.

“All students, please report to the auditorium for the special presentation on our school’s history,” the announcement echoed over the speakers. “Attendance is mandatory.”

The auditorium was buzzing when I arrived, every student packed into the rows of folding chairs. The stage was set with a large projector screen, and the principal stood at the podium, ready to introduce a guest speaker—a retired teacher who’d apparently been at the school for decades.

I found a seat near the back, away from Diego and his crew, but I couldn’t stop glancing around for Malik. He walked in just as the lights dimmed, his cream-colored hoodie standing out against the sea of uniforms. He spotted me and gave a small nod before taking a seat near the middle.

The presentation started off normal enough—a boring slideshow about the school’s founding, old photos of classrooms, and a speech from the former teacher about “how much has changed over the years.”

But then something unexpected happened.

The screen flickered, the slideshow freezing. For a moment, everyone thought it was a technical glitch, but then a voice recording played through the speakers.

“Shut up, princess. You think you can just walk around looking like that and not expect attention?”

The entire auditorium went silent.

The voice was Diego’s.

Gasps rippled through the crowd as more audio played—a chilling conversation from the bathroom. Diego’s threats, his mocking tone, Malik’s trembling voice as he tried to push him away. It was all there.

On the screen, text messages appeared, projected for everyone to see. They were vile—messages Diego had sent Malik, taunting him, harassing him, making threats.

“Is this part of the presentation?” someone whispered.

The principal scrambled toward the tech booth, shouting at the student operating the projector. But Malik stood up before anyone could stop him.

“This is the truth,” Malik said, his voice clear and steady despite the tremor in his hands. He turned to face the crowd, his eyes scanning the room. “You all want to know what happened on Friday? This is it. Diego cornered me in the bathroom. He’s been harassing me for weeks, and when Ahmed tried to stop him, Diego turned it into a fight to protect himself.”

The auditorium erupted in whispers.

Malik’s voice rose, cutting through the noise. “You think this is just some stupid drama? It’s not. He tried to hurt me. And if Ahmed hadn’t stepped in, I don’t know what would’ve happened.”

All eyes turned to Diego, who sat frozen in his seat, his face pale.

“This is bullshit!” Diego shouted, standing up. “He’s lying! That recording is fake!”

“It’s not fake,” Malik shot back. “And you know it.”

The principal finally managed to cut the projector feed, but the damage was done. Every student in the room had seen and heard enough.

“You’re a coward, Diego,” Malik said, his voice cracking but still strong. “You think you can do whatever you want because your parents can cover for you. But not this time.”

The room erupted into chaos. Some students were yelling, others whispering furiously. Diego’s face twisted in anger and humiliation.

“You’re gonna regret this,” he spat at Malik before storming out of the auditorium.

By the end of the day, Diego’s fate was sealed. He was thrown off the football team for his behavior, and his parents were called in for a meeting with the principal. The school didn’t expel him outright, but the fallout was enough to make him transfer within the week.

After the assembly, I found Malik sitting alone outside the gym, his knees pulled up to his chest.

“You okay?” I asked, sitting down beside him.

He nodded, but his eyes were red. “It was the right thing to do. But it still sucks.”

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “But you were brave. Everyone knows the truth now.”

He gave me a small smile, leaning his head against my shoulder. “Thanks for being there, Ahmed. I couldn’t have done this without you.”

I didn’t say anything, just wrapped an arm around him and held him close. For the first time in days, the storm inside me felt calm.

The rest of the weekend was a haze—texts from my friends, my mom reminding me to finish my chores, even Kareem sending memes in our group chat. But none of it broke through the wall of emotions that had been building since Friday night.

By Monday, I was no closer to figuring out how I felt. Excited? Nervous? Terrified? Probably all of the above.
Walking into school that morning, I felt the familiar weight of eyes on me. It wasn’t just the usual stares from underclassmen or teachers giving me their “student-athlete” nods. No, this was different. People were whispering.
“Yo, Ahmed!” Sam called from the front steps.
I plastered on a neutral expression and walked over. He was leaning against the railing, a coffee in one hand and his phone in the other.

“Sup,” I muttered, shoving my hands into my pockets.

“Man, where were you this weekend? Group chat’s been blowing up about you and Diego.”

My stomach tightened. “What about it?”

Sam smirked. “Word is you went full UFC on him in the bathroom. Teachers won’t say why, but Diego’s got a black eye, and you’re walking around like you just won the heavyweight title.”

I shrugged. “He deserved it.”

Sam raised an eyebrow. “So it’s true? Damn. What’d he do?”

I didn’t answer. My jaw clenched, and I could feel the heat rising in my chest again, the memory of Malik’s terrified expression flashing in my mind.

Sam whistled. “Yo, you’re serious. Whatever it was, it must’ve been bad. Diego’s been running his mouth about you all weekend. You might want to—”

He trailed off, his eyes flicking past me. I turned and saw Malik walking toward us, his pink sweater replaced by a soft cream-colored hoodie. He looked calm, but I caught the briefest flicker of hesitation in his eyes when he saw me.

“Hey,” Malik said, his voice light but cautious.

“Hey,” I replied, my chest tightening.
Sam glanced between us, his smirk fading as he pieced something together. “Alright, I’ll catch you later, Ahmed.” He gave me a pointed look before strolling off.
Malik shifted on his feet, his hands tucked into the front pocket of his hoodie. “Can we talk?”
I nodded, motioning toward the quieter side of the courtyard. We walked in silence until we were out of earshot from the other students.
“I’m sorry,” Malik said, his voice barely above a whisper.

“For what?” I asked, genuinely confused.

“For dragging you into my mess,” he said, looking down at his shoes. “You didn’t have to fight Diego. You could’ve just walked away.”
“Walk away?” My voice rose, and Malik flinched slightly. I took a deep breath, forcing myself to calm down. “I couldn’t just stand there and do nothing. You think I’d let him treat you like that?”
Malik looked up, his eyes shimmering with unshed tears. “Most people would’ve.”
“Well, I’m not most people,” I said firmly. “You don’t deserve to be treated like that, Malik. Nobody does.”
He blinked, and for a moment, I thought he was going to cry. But then he smiled—a small, genuine smile that made my chest ache.
“Thank you,” he said softly.

We stood there for a moment, the tension between us thick but not uncomfortable.

“Are you okay?” I asked finally.
Malik nodded. “Better now.” He hesitated before adding, “But… people are talking, Ahmed. About Friday. About us.”
I frowned. “Let them talk. I don’t care.”
“You should,” he said, his voice tinged with worry. “This isn’t just gossip. Diego’s been telling everyone you’re… you know.”
“That I’m what?”
Malik hesitated, then said quietly, “That you’re into me.”
The words hit like a freight train. My stomach flipped, and for a moment, I couldn’t breathe.
“And if I am?” I said before I could stop myself.
Malik’s eyes widened, his cheeks flushing pink. “You… you mean that?”
I swallowed hard, the weight of the moment pressing down on me. “I don’t know what I mean,” I admitted. “I just know that I care about you, Malik. More than I probably should.”
The silence that followed was deafening. Malik stared at me, his expression unreadable. Then, slowly, he reached out and took my hand.
“You don’t have to figure it all out right now,” he said, his voice gentle. “But… I’m here. If you want to talk. Or anything.”

I nodded, my throat too tight to speak.
The bell rang, breaking the moment. Malik let go of my hand, but his gaze lingered.
“See you in class,” he said, turning and walking away.
I stood there, watching him go, my heart pounding in my chest.

 Monday hit hard.

Diego was back.
He strolled into school like nothing had happened, his busted lip and black eye doing nothing to wipe the smug look off his face. Word spread fast that his parents had bailed him out, pulling enough strings to keep him out of trouble.
And Diego wasn’t backing down.
By lunch, the rumors had grown louder. Everyone seemed to know about the fight in the bathroom, and Diego was milking it for all it was worth, telling anyone who’d listen that I had a thing for Malik.

“Yo, Ahmed!” Diego called as I passed him in the hallway. He leaned against a locker, his arms crossed and that infuriating smirk plastered across his face. “Still playing hero for your little boyfriend? How cute.”

I ignored him, my fists clenched at my sides.
“That’s right. Walk away,” he sneered. “Can’t finish what you started, huh?”
It took everything in me not to turn around and wipe that look off his face, but I kept walking. Malik didn’t need me starting another fight.
By the time the school-wide assembly rolled around, I was wound so tight I could barely focus.

“All students, please report to the auditorium for the special presentation on our school’s history,” the announcement echoed over the speakers. “Attendance is mandatory.”

The auditorium was buzzing when I arrived, every student packed into the rows of folding chairs. The stage was set with a large projector screen, and the principal stood at the podium, ready to introduce a guest speaker—a retired teacher who’d apparently been at the school for decades.

I found a seat near the back, away from Diego and his crew, but I couldn’t stop glancing around for Malik. He walked in just as the lights dimmed, his cream-colored hoodie standing out against the sea of uniforms. He spotted me and gave a small nod before taking a seat near the middle.

The presentation started off normal enough—a boring slideshow about the school’s founding, old photos of classrooms, and a speech from the former teacher about “how much has changed over the years.”

But then something unexpected happened.

The screen flickered, the slideshow freezing. For a moment, everyone thought it was a technical glitch, but then a voice recording played through the speakers.

“Shut up, princess. You think you can just walk around looking like that and not expect attention?”

The entire auditorium went silent.

The voice was Diego’s.

Gasps rippled through the crowd as more audio played—a chilling conversation from the bathroom. Diego’s threats, his mocking tone, Malik’s trembling voice as he tried to push him away. It was all there.

On the screen, text messages appeared, projected for everyone to see. They were vile—messages Diego had sent Malik, taunting him, harassing him, making threats.

“Is this part of the presentation?” someone whispered.

The principal scrambled toward the tech booth, shouting at the student operating the projector. But Malik stood up before anyone could stop him.

“This is the truth,” Malik said, his voice clear and steady despite the tremor in his hands. He turned to face the crowd, his eyes scanning the room. “You all want to know what happened on Friday? This is it. Diego cornered me in the bathroom. He’s been harassing me for weeks, and when Ahmed tried to stop him, Diego turned it into a fight to protect himself.”

The auditorium erupted in whispers.

Malik’s voice rose, cutting through the noise. “You think this is just some stupid drama? It’s not. He tried to hurt me. And if Ahmed hadn’t stepped in, I don’t know what would’ve happened.”

All eyes turned to Diego, who sat frozen in his seat, his face pale.

“This is bullshit!” Diego shouted, standing up. “He’s lying! That recording is fake!”

“It’s not fake,” Malik shot back. “And you know it.”

The principal finally managed to cut the projector feed, but the damage was done. Every student in the room had seen and heard enough.

“You’re a coward, Diego,” Malik said, his voice cracking but still strong. “You think you can do whatever you want because your parents can cover for you. But not this time.”

The room erupted into chaos. Some students were yelling, others whispering furiously. Diego’s face twisted in anger and humiliation.

“You’re gonna regret this,” he spat at Malik before storming out of the auditorium.

By the end of the day, Diego’s fate was sealed. He was thrown off the football team for his behavior, and his parents were called in for a meeting with the principal. The school didn’t expel him outright, but the fallout was enough to make him transfer within the week.

After the assembly, I found Malik sitting alone outside the gym, his knees pulled up to his chest.

“You okay?” I asked, sitting down beside him.

He nodded, but his eyes were red. “It was the right thing to do. But it still sucks.”

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “But you were brave. Everyone knows the truth now.”

He gave me a small smile, leaning his head against my shoulder. “Thanks for being there, Ahmed. I couldn’t have done this without you.”

I didn’t say anything, just wrapped an arm around him and held him close. For the first time in days, the storm inside me felt calm.

This has happened several times to me, and I'm trying to figure out if it's totally related to GERD.

Last night, I ate chips and queso, wings, and drank beer for dinner.  Obviously not great for GERD, but I've eaten that exact meal plenty of times without things being too bad.  Another thing that I will mention is that I had a 1-shot latte at about 5 PM in addition to the 2-shot latte that I had at 9 AM.  I don't typically drink a second coffee during the day.

When I went to bed, I was pretty much nonstop burping for 1.5-2 hours.  I felt pressure in my chest that the burps would temporarily relieve.  I elevated my head and started to go to sleep on my left side, and when I fell asleep, I woke up immediately feeling like I was starved for air, and I felt lightheaded, as if I was about to pass back out from it (although I didn't).  

This ended up triggering the first panic attack that I've had in a while, which was not a fun time, but eventually I calmed down enough and tried to go back to sleep, but I kept immediately waking back up feeling lightheaded and starved for air, until 4 Tums later, everything finally calmed down and I was able to go to sleep.

However, after a day of usage, does anyone feel like it is \*unusually\* glossy compared to Apple glossy displays? It's perfect but my needs, but it feels super glossy, like old super glossy displays from decades ago before they started handling reflections better.

I'm used to working on iMacs, Macbook Airs, Macbook Pros, etc, but a black background on the P16 is like staring at myself in a mirror.

I did a comparison with my Macbook Air 2023 and it handled window reflections much better. Comparing the two, the Air seems almost ""semi-matte"" - a little less vibrant than the P16, but much better at handling window reflections. The P16 seems really sensitive to light sources.

Since I'm new to the device, just wondering if I'm being nitpicky, or does anyone agree? And if so, has anyone found any fixes, or recommendations for similar models to the P16? I work in coffee shops where I can't control light sources.

TLDR printing some stuff to make coffee (some sort of clip to attach to a machine so the filter stays) and im struggling to find a material.

The clip would act as a separator between the coffee maker (Chemex) and filter, and thus, it’d touch glass, paper filter and hot water which will be poured to the coffee that’s inside the filter. This means it’ll be touching hot water while it goes through the grind coffee.

Flexibility is needed so I can actually clamp (so a small degree)  
Piece is 10cm long and 3mm thick. Flex im looking is rather small, although I can accep softer flex
  
Was thinking of TPU but not sure whether contact with hot water will leave to residues.

I happen to also have PPA-CF but I believe its a very stiff material (would it accept some degree of flex?)

The rest of the weekend was a haze—texts from my friends, my mom reminding me to finish my chores, even Kareem sending memes in our group chat. But none of it broke through the wall of emotions that had been building since Friday night.

By Monday, I was no closer to figuring out how I felt. Excited? Nervous? Terrified? Probably all of the above.
Walking into school that morning, I felt the familiar weight of eyes on me. It wasn’t just the usual stares from underclassmen or teachers giving me their “student-athlete” nods. No, this was different. People were whispering.
“Yo, Ahmed!” Sam called from the front steps.
I plastered on a neutral expression and walked over. He was leaning against the railing, a coffee in one hand and his phone in the other.

“Sup,” I muttered, shoving my hands into my pockets.

“Man, where were you this weekend? Group chat’s been blowing up about you and Diego.”

My stomach tightened. “What about it?”

Sam smirked. “Word is you went full UFC on him in the bathroom. Teachers won’t say why, but Diego’s got a black eye, and you’re walking around like you just won the heavyweight title.”

I shrugged. “He deserved it.”

Sam raised an eyebrow. “So it’s true? Damn. What’d he do?”

I didn’t answer. My jaw clenched, and I could feel the heat rising in my chest again, the memory of Malik’s terrified expression flashing in my mind.

Sam whistled. “Yo, you’re serious. Whatever it was, it must’ve been bad. Diego’s been running his mouth about you all weekend. You might want to—”

He trailed off, his eyes flicking past me. I turned and saw Malik walking toward us, his pink sweater replaced by a soft cream-colored hoodie. He looked calm, but I caught the briefest flicker of hesitation in his eyes when he saw me.

“Hey,” Malik said, his voice light but cautious.

“Hey,” I replied, my chest tightening.
Sam glanced between us, his smirk fading as he pieced something together. “Alright, I’ll catch you later, Ahmed.” He gave me a pointed look before strolling off.
Malik shifted on his feet, his hands tucked into the front pocket of his hoodie. “Can we talk?”
I nodded, motioning toward the quieter side of the courtyard. We walked in silence until we were out of earshot from the other students.
“I’m sorry,” Malik said, his voice barely above a whisper.

“For what?” I asked, genuinely confused.

“For dragging you into my mess,” he said, looking down at his shoes. “You didn’t have to fight Diego. You could’ve just walked away.”
“Walk away?” My voice rose, and Malik flinched slightly. I took a deep breath, forcing myself to calm down. “I couldn’t just stand there and do nothing. You think I’d let him treat you like that?”
Malik looked up, his eyes shimmering with unshed tears. “Most people would’ve.”
“Well, I’m not most people,” I said firmly. “You don’t deserve to be treated like that, Malik. Nobody does.”
He blinked, and for a moment, I thought he was going to cry. But then he smiled—a small, genuine smile that made my chest ache.
“Thank you,” he said softly.

We stood there for a moment, the tension between us thick but not uncomfortable.

“Are you okay?” I asked finally.
Malik nodded. “Better now.” He hesitated before adding, “But… people are talking, Ahmed. About Friday. About us.”
I frowned. “Let them talk. I don’t care.”
“You should,” he said, his voice tinged with worry. “This isn’t just gossip. Diego’s been telling everyone you’re… you know.”
“That I’m what?”
Malik hesitated, then said quietly, “That you’re into me.”
The words hit like a freight train. My stomach flipped, and for a moment, I couldn’t breathe.
“And if I am?” I said before I could stop myself.
Malik’s eyes widened, his cheeks flushing pink. “You… you mean that?”
I swallowed hard, the weight of the moment pressing down on me. “I don’t know what I mean,” I admitted. “I just know that I care about you, Malik. More than I probably should.”
The silence that followed was deafening. Malik stared at me, his expression unreadable. Then, slowly, he reached out and took my hand.
“You don’t have to figure it all out right now,” he said, his voice gentle. “But… I’m here. If you want to talk. Or anything.”

I nodded, my throat too tight to speak.
The bell rang, breaking the moment. Malik let go of my hand, but his gaze lingered.
“See you in class,” he said, turning and walking away.
I stood there, watching him go, my heart pounding in my chest.

 Monday hit hard.

Diego was back.
He strolled into school like nothing had happened, his busted lip and black eye doing nothing to wipe the smug look off his face. Word spread fast that his parents had bailed him out, pulling enough strings to keep him out of trouble.
And Diego wasn’t backing down.
By lunch, the rumors had grown louder. Everyone seemed to know about the fight in the bathroom, and Diego was milking it for all it was worth, telling anyone who’d listen that I had a thing for Malik.

“Yo, Ahmed!” Diego called as I passed him in the hallway. He leaned against a locker, his arms crossed and that infuriating smirk plastered across his face. “Still playing hero for your little boyfriend? How cute.”

I ignored him, my fists clenched at my sides.
“That’s right. Walk away,” he sneered. “Can’t finish what you started, huh?”
It took everything in me not to turn around and wipe that look off his face, but I kept walking. Malik didn’t need me starting another fight.
By the time the school-wide assembly rolled around, I was wound so tight I could barely focus.

“All students, please report to the auditorium for the special presentation on our school’s history,” the announcement echoed over the speakers. “Attendance is mandatory.”

The auditorium was buzzing when I arrived, every student packed into the rows of folding chairs. The stage was set with a large projector screen, and the principal stood at the podium, ready to introduce a guest speaker—a retired teacher who’d apparently been at the school for decades.

I found a seat near the back, away from Diego and his crew, but I couldn’t stop glancing around for Malik. He walked in just as the lights dimmed, his cream-colored hoodie standing out against the sea of uniforms. He spotted me and gave a small nod before taking a seat near the middle.

The presentation started off normal enough—a boring slideshow about the school’s founding, old photos of classrooms, and a speech from the former teacher about “how much has changed over the years.”

But then something unexpected happened.

The screen flickered, the slideshow freezing. For a moment, everyone thought it was a technical glitch, but then a voice recording played through the speakers.

“Shut up, princess. You think you can just walk around looking like that and not expect attention?”

The entire auditorium went silent.

The voice was Diego’s.

Gasps rippled through the crowd as more audio played—a chilling conversation from the bathroom. Diego’s threats, his mocking tone, Malik’s trembling voice as he tried to push him away. It was all there.

On the screen, text messages appeared, projected for everyone to see. They were vile—messages Diego had sent Malik, taunting him, harassing him, making threats.

“Is this part of the presentation?” someone whispered.

The principal scrambled toward the tech booth, shouting at the student operating the projector. But Malik stood up before anyone could stop him.

“This is the truth,” Malik said, his voice clear and steady despite the tremor in his hands. He turned to face the crowd, his eyes scanning the room. “You all want to know what happened on Friday? This is it. Diego cornered me in the bathroom. He’s been harassing me for weeks, and when Ahmed tried to stop him, Diego turned it into a fight to protect himself.”

The auditorium erupted in whispers.

Malik’s voice rose, cutting through the noise. “You think this is just some stupid drama? It’s not. He tried to hurt me. And if Ahmed hadn’t stepped in, I don’t know what would’ve happened.”

All eyes turned to Diego, who sat frozen in his seat, his face pale.

“This is bullshit!” Diego shouted, standing up. “He’s lying! That recording is fake!”

“It’s not fake,” Malik shot back. “And you know it.”

The principal finally managed to cut the projector feed, but the damage was done. Every student in the room had seen and heard enough.

“You’re a coward, Diego,” Malik said, his voice cracking but still strong. “You think you can do whatever you want because your parents can cover for you. But not this time.”

The room erupted into chaos. Some students were yelling, others whispering furiously. Diego’s face twisted in anger and humiliation.

“You’re gonna regret this,” he spat at Malik before storming out of the auditorium.

By the end of the day, Diego’s fate was sealed. He was thrown off the football team for his behavior, and his parents were called in for a meeting with the principal. The school didn’t expel him outright, but the fallout was enough to make him transfer within the week.

After the assembly, I found Malik sitting alone outside the gym, his knees pulled up to his chest.

“You okay?” I asked, sitting down beside him.

He nodded, but his eyes were red. “It was the right thing to do. But it still sucks.”

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “But you were brave. Everyone knows the truth now.”

He gave me a small smile, leaning his head against my shoulder. “Thanks for being there, Ahmed. I couldn’t have done this without you.”

I didn’t say anything, just wrapped an arm around him and held him close. For the first time in days, the storm inside me felt calm.",1,1736957694.0,stories,1,0.67,False
1i20y84,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1i20y84/differences_between_zwift_and_training_peaks/,Differences between Zwift and Training Peaks Virtual,"I’m wondering what everyone else’s experience is with Zwift vs Training Peaks Virtual.

I’ve been using both for about 4 months now and there are some big differences.

  
For me the biggest difference is just the amount of riders.  It can feel very lonely at times riding in Training Peaks Virtual compared to the always crowded Zwift.  In Zwift, if I get dropped by the pace group, there’s always people behind I can ride with.  Likewise if I break away.

But the second most obvious difference is just the physics of riding in a pack.  Training Peaks Virtual feels more like real life than Zwift.  Zwift just feels more nebulous, even arbitrary at times when sitting in a pack or breaking away, or even trying to catch a pack.  Training Peaks reminds me of when I raced competitively and realized that drafting was a real thing, that let me sit in a pack with riders with a higher aerobic threshold, and still win races.  Although Zwift has some draft effect, its not nearly as close to reality as Training Peaks Virtual.

And finally, I’m noticing that, Training Peaks Virtual doesn’t have those suspicious ultra high Watts/Kg sustaining a constant power output, mile after mile.  They’re ubiquitous in Zwift.  I call them CPE’s, “Constant Power Entities” because it seems to me that they are either bots or someone just set the throttle on their ebike for 350 watts and left to get some coffee and donuts.  They just don’t seem to exist in Training Peaks Virtual (yet).",6,1736957688.0,cycling,7,1.0,False
