Accoring to a google search, it appears the song was quite popular in the world of Euro Disco for a hot moment but I don't think any deejays spinning records in Indy clubs at that time knew or cared about it.  

It's record cover is designed with the Indy 500 checkered flag logo on it.

1lmdrgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookpro/comments/1lmdrgd/i_cannot_decide_between_the_macbook_pro_14_and_16/,I cannot decide between the MacBook Pro 14 and 16 in,"I am stuck y'all, please help me I have been to the store like 5 times and I still feel so indecisive. I just don't know which one I want. Can you please give me your thoughts one each if you have either of these or your thoughts if you've had both? 

I have had the 2013 13 in MacBook Pro for the last 12 years, I've used it I've loved it and it's been a really great investment. It's gotten me through college, work, everyday usage (email, browsing, etc.) but I've known for a long time that it was time for a replacement and recently both the speakers blew out so it's not even fully functional without some type of headphones or external speakers. I personally don't want to spend the $400 Apple is saying it will be to replace it at this point I feel that money would be better spent  on a replacement.

I'm not in a big rush as I have a 13in iPad Pro with the keyboard that I can use for most stuff for now in addition to my work laptop. It does a lot and it's great for a tablet, but I feel that it just doesn't fully replace my need for some sort of personal computer. I have considered the whole Mac lineup from desktop to laptop but I think ultimately it's nice to have the keyboard and everything bundled in with my laptop just in case I do need to take it with me somewhere.

  
Here's my dilemma, I've been to the Apple Store about 5 times and I cannot for the life of me decide which one I want. I've never been so indecisive about a purchase truly. I'm not really sure what my hangup is.

I'd say my current usage of the my current Mac  is limited as I don't use it a lot cause it's so slow. 

I mainly use it for surfing the web, filling out documents, and pretty much anything that the iPad cannot handle. I can use this for work stuff if I want but what I currently have cannot handle that. Primarily I use my work provided laptop which is a Windows Laptop 15.6 in i7, 32 GB of RAM, 4TB of storage its about 3.7 lbs. While I know that the MacBook Air would probably be okay for my usage I prefer the pro just to future proof it a bit given that my last laptop has lasted so long I'd love to get the same longevity out of this. 

  
Regardless of which size I get I plan to get the M4 Pro MacBook Pro 14 Core, 24 GB of RAM, 1 or 2 TB of Storage. Because of the storage size I want/need it makes more sense to go with the higher spec 14 vs 12 core because the pricing ends up to be similar so may as well get the better one.

  
So currently I don't take my personal (MacBook) out of the house because I travel to the office with my Windows laptop daily. However, I pretty much use it in the house daily. I plan to get a desk and external monitor setup with a docking station but I just moved and haven't fully completed my setup at the moment. My hang up is I love the idea of a 16 in but I feel like it's better to use it at a desk or a stationary place. I  like to use it my Mac over my house. When I'm in bed, while watching TV on the couch, sitting at my coffee table, sitting at my island. I almost feel that the 16 will get in the way of trying to multitask in other areas. While the 14 may prevail in those areas I feel the 16 shines elsewhere. When I really need to lock in and get things done, and when I'm sitting down somewhere like a desk or a table that extra screen real estate shines, and when I'm actually trying to multitask on what I am focused on. I'm wondering if this will become a moot point if I get a desk and external monitor setup. Kind of a best of both worlds, when I'm at my desk I have all the screen I need. When I'm on my couch I have the more portable laptop.

Writing this post might've helped me decide, but I'm posting anyways for feedback! Any thoughts help.",1,1751083922.0,macbookpro,1,1.0,False
1lmdrcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Socialism_101/comments/1lmdrcb/is_it_already_too_late_in_my_heart_i_dont_think/,"Is it already too late?  In my heart, I don’t think so, but what good is that? It’s equivalent to thoughts and prayers…","If there are approximately 1 billion people, more or less, benefiting from this corrupt system of Western European-developed capitalism, then the voices of dissent, along with mine, are  a drop in the bucket. And worse, our consumption, whether it’s cars, mobile phones, televisions, subscriptions, or clothing, keeps this corrupt system operating, making less of the drop of dissent we have in our ideologies. That, along with the countless numbers who remain indifferent, simply going along with the status quo. It raises a critical question: how can such a deeply rooted system be dismantled?

Is the meaning behind revolution warfare? If so, that is not the solution; those who believe it is are blindl to the overwhelming power dynamics at play. The beneficiaries of this system, whatever those numbers are, and it’s more than the Socialist movement, will readily fight to protect their slice of the corruption that provides for them. So, what can counteract it?

I think a solution lies in thoroughly exposing the harsh realities faced by those who are exploited and enslaved in the production process of the goods we consume, goods that are tainted with the blood, sweat, and tears of the oppressed. These people suffer severely because Western institutions finance corrupt puppet regimes who, in turn, violate their human rights, further entrenching poverty and despair. Meanwhile, the media, a western institution, highlights the corruption of these regimes, intentionally overlooking the financial backing that sustains them.

This pervasive corruption infiltrates all aspects of our societies, from maritime law to the United Nations,to different western governance systems, and  even extends into the realms of drug cartels and human trafficking. Words are not enough; philosophical debates about the evils of capitalism accomplishes nothing. To bring about meaningful change, we must confront the realities of exploitation and bring to light the fact that we, ourselves, benefit from it. We must expose who is actually suffering under this global socioeconomic inequity. Because it’s not us, drinking coffee, revering Che and waxing philosophical.

1lmdplu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1lmdplu/extreme_tolerance_to_medication/,Extreme tolerance to medication,"Hi everyone,

I’m really struggling with what seems like rapid tolerance or a blunted response to almost every medication I’ve tried — not just ADHD meds like Vyvanse or Concerta, but also antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds/benzos, and even caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, etc.).

The pattern is always the same:
Day 1 feels amazing — the medication works exactly how it should. But then, by the second day, the effects drop off completely. It feels like I haven’t taken anything at all. I’ve tried taking breaks of several days (or even longer), but even then, when I take it again, the Day 1 effect doesn’t return. It’s like my brain adapts instantly and just shuts it down after the first exposure.

I also deal with anhedonia (lack of motivation/pleasure), which is why I tried TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) — but unfortunately I didn’t respond to it either. I’m now considering deep TMS (dTMS), but I’m wondering:
	•	Could this extreme sensitivity or tolerance to meds be causing my anhedonia?
	•	Or is the anhedonia blunting my ability to feel the effects of meds?
	•	Has anyone else experienced this across multiple med types?

This has been really frustrating and disheartening, and I’d really appreciate any insight, similar experiences, or ideas to bring to my psychiatrist.

Thank you so much in advance",1,1751083746.0,AskPsychiatry,1,1.0,False

Some family members want me to fix a veneered coffee table that has a damaged top. They’re expecting a clean, professional-looking result, but the damage is pretty deep, and the veneer is chipped and uneven.

They think I can just strip off all the veneer and apply new veneer to the entire top (4x2ft) and get it looking good with some patience and YouTube videos. I’ve done general woodworking and refinishing before (stripping, staining, poly, etc.), but I’ve never worked with veneer.

I’ve tried explaining to them that veneer repair is way more complicated than it seems, especially if you want it to actually look good, and I don’t have the proper tools or experience to do it right. But they insist I can do it.

1lmdmj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1lmdmj1/lighthouse_in_the_storm/,Lighthouse in The Storm,"Dear You,

I know.

I know how hard it is to trust feelings when your heart has been through so much. When the hands that once reached for you let go too soon. When love has looked like absence, or silence, or someone who couldn't meet you in the thunderstorm of life and couldn’t hold you steady along the way. I know you’ve been let down by those who should have held you better. I know you’ve poured yourself into others who didn’t know how to receive something as rare and whole as your love. I know you’ve had to carry yourself through heartache, through silence, through uncertainty and survival.

And then suddenly there’s me offering something steady and strong. And I know that it's hard to believe anyone could offer care without asking for something in return. I see the way you doubt the kindness I offer, like it must have strings. I hear the way you protect your heart when something feels too gentle to be real. I know you find it hard to believe that you deserve something steady, something safe, something real. And I don’t blame you for any of that. Never. But I want you to know that you do. If anyone does, you do.

I wish you could see yourself through my eyes, not gilded by fantasy or filtered through rose-colored glasses, but raw, real, beautiful you. The woman who feels deeply, gives selflessly, and still dares to hope even when you're broken and exhausted. The you that even you weren’t aware you were showing at times. The you that, when you realized it was present, quietly pulled back. I saw her fade into the shadows, and while I hoped to see her again, I was simply grateful you let me see her at all.

I wish you could feel what I feel when I hear your voice, or read your words, or imagine you in some quiet moment, a beautiful mess, softly laughing, holding space for everyone, yet rarely being held in return. I only wish you knew how deeply I want to hold you. Not with expectation, but with presence. To be buried in you. Engulfed by you.

If only you knew exactly how I felt. If I could place my hands to your heart and pour the truth into you there’d be no room left for doubt. If I could quiet every voice that ever made you feel unworthy, too much, or not enough, and replace them with the way I see you. Hear you. Feel you. Hold you close, even from afar.

What I feel, it isn’t fleeting. It isn’t a fragile, heart-shaped piece of rose quartz. It doesn’t flinch when met by distance. It’s rooted in presence and shaped by choice. It’s in the way I want to offer more than words. I want to show you how I feel through touch, through quiet acts of care, through the consistency of just being there, when you’re happy, when you’re hurting, and when you’re simply existing and want someone close.

And when I speak of presence, I don’t just mean being there emotionally I mean holding you in a way that reminds you what it feels like to be desired without demand.

The way I want to trace your skin gentle but firm. The way I want to learn your silences, your rhythms, your softness. And the places where softness gives way to tension, to craving. Not to take it from you, but to offer something.

Safety. Tenderness. Reverence. Gratification.

To show you that being wanted doesn't have to mean being used. That being desired can feel like being worshiped. That your body isn't something to control or quiet, but something to meet fully. Breath to breath, skin to skin, until you're not just seen, but known.

I want to kiss you in the places no one's thought to kiss you before. To trace the curve of your spine with my mouth like a vow. To listen to the way, you whisper need without speaking. To take my time. To draw it out. To undo the guarded parts of you slowly, until surrender feels like safety and pleasure becomes something you no longer apologize for.

Because what I crave isn't just closeness, but depth. The kind that's only found in the quiet moans, the slow unraveling, the trust that lets us both let go.

And these feelings are here to stay. Not in a way that traps or demands, but like a lighthouse; remaining lit, just in case the person at sea ever needs to find their way back to shore.

If you choose me, I’d gladly be that for you.

What I offer, I offer freely. No expectations. No deadlines. Just the honest investment of a man who sees you clearly and still wants to lean in. I offer it because you’ve become a quiet center in my world without even trying. A comfort I look forward to. A presence I miss when it’s gone. And I know you don’t always feel strong or steady, but you’ve been those things for me just by being yourself.

I want to live a life with you, one where we laugh too loud and get caught in the rain sometimes. One where we have coffee together in the morning, smiling over each other’s messy hair, and evenings on the soft couch entangled in each other and a movie. Slow dances in the kitchen. A life where we can argue and still feel safe, because love is never in question. A life where your joy is the rhythm that guides mine.

I want to be the person you lean into at the end of a long day. The quiet presence who holds you without needing you to explain. The hand you hold while we walk on wooded trails. The warmth beside you on the couch. The slow fingertips brushing over your arm as we talk about nothing and everything. I want to be the one who wraps you in the kind of safety you’ve longed for not just physically, but emotionally. A place to fall. A space to land. A home. I want to be your calm in the chaos. Your warmth in the cold. Your soft landing when everything else feels sharp.

I know the kind of trust I’m asking for takes time. I know you’ve been burned by promises and hurt by people who didn’t stay. But I also know what I feel, and I know it’s not going anywhere.

And I wonder sometimes... if maybe the pieces of me I’ve been holding all this time are the very ones your heart has been looking for to feel whole again. Not to fix what’s broken. But to fit into the places that long to be understood. To love you not for who I hope you become, but for who you already are. Messy. Brave. Guarded. Glorious.

I don’t want to be your escape. I want to be your presence. The steady breath beside you. The soft voice in the dark. The arms that hold you not because you need rescuing but because you deserve to be held.

So, I ask, gently not to pressure, not to rush, but to offer my puzzle pieces to you:

Will you let me be the arms you can fall into without hesitation?  
Will you let me be your safe place?  
Will you let me be the steady presence in your future?  
Will you let me be the hand that doesn’t let go, the love that holds when the world feels too heavy?  
Will you let me show you, through touch, through kindness, through presence, that the kind of love you long for does exist?  
Will you let me show you that someone can hold you without needing you to shrink or bend or break?  
Will you let me show you that you do deserve that kind of love?

I offer this not as a burden, but as a quiet gift: my heart, missing some pieces, yes, but still perfectly shaped to hold yours. Not because I expect anything in return. Not because I want to rush you. But because I believe in what we could be, if we’re brave enough to try.

You don’t have to answer now. Or soon. Or even at all. If you need time, space, or silence, I’ll honor that.

But please know—whatever your pace, whatever your process—I’ll remain.  
Not waiting with impatience… but staying, with care.

Still.  
Steady.

“The world’s gone soft,” muttered Wren, eyes glassy from decades of unreconciled grief and fathers who only taught how to hurt, not how to feel. “Back in my day, men were men. Now you can’t even say anything without someone crying.”

Psychologists reviewing his post history said the only person doing all the crying is, and always has been, Douglas.

### Experts Confirm: Yes, It’s Just Pain in a Hat

“He’s not really mad at gay people,” said Dr. Leigh Garland, trauma specialist and adult emotional archaeologist. “He’s mad that he was never allowed to cry. He’s mad that love was something he was told to fear. And he’s furious that he’s 47 and the only thing he’s ever felt safe doing is hating other people louder than he’s ever been able to love himself.”

“He’s basically a trench coat full of unresolved childhood nights crying into a pillowcase that smelled like tobacco and disappointment,” Garland added. “But sure, let’s scream about drag queens.”

### “They’re Shoving It in Our Faces,” Says Man Who Voluntarily Watches Gay TikToks for Hours

Despite repeatedly claiming “they’re everywhere,” Wren appears to consume a steady diet of queer content, going out of his way to comment “disgusting” and “sick world” under every single video featuring a man in eyeliner.

“He keeps saying he just wants to protect the children,” said longtime neighbor Nancy Rhodes. “But last week he spent 15 minutes yelling at a rainbow flag on a coffee mug in Target. I think the children are fine. He’s the one who needs protection—from himself.”

---

### Family Describes Him as “A Man Made of Sandpaper and Screaming”

Douglas’s ex-wife, Cheryl Wren, said she spent 12 years married to what she described as “a man who thought empathy was weakness and never once asked himself why everyone around him left.”

“He always said he hated the ‘rainbow crowd,’” she recalled. “But he never looked that angry unless someone mentioned their dad loved them.”

---

### Final Outcome: Man Projects Until There’s Nothing Left

At press time, Wren was seen reposting an AI-generated photo of “a straight white family in heaven” overlaid with Bible verses he’s never read, typing furiously into the void: *“This is what we’ve lost.”*

His hands were trembling, his eyes refusing to meet his own reflection in the screen. Deep down, a small voice — one he drowned long ago — whispered: *You don’t even know what love is.*

He muted it with more outrage. He always does.",2,1751083241.0,AiSatire,0,1.0,False

I absolutely LOVED it. However, I went into a coffee shop in old town one day and this girl wanted my seat in the cafe (it was the most desired window seat) and randomly started a very embarrassing, strange and loud altercation. I ended up being so embarrassed that I let her have the seat (I am very non confrontational).

I want to visit Edinburgh again, but for some reason, this girl really made me have a sour feeling about it because that embarrassing and alarming moment really shook me. This isn’t really an Edinburgh question but I was wondering if others can tell me how I can find the love for the city again so I can go back and enjoy it like I did before.

I’ve been with my current company for 2.5 years, but growth has slowed significantly and most of the top reps have already left ... I’m looking to make my move as well.

I’ve never worked at a large software company (eg: Salesforce, AWS, Workday), and the biggest company I’ve been at was <$500M ARR. I'm now researching where I want to go next - especially with all the momentum around GenAI, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity.

From my research, here’s where I’ve landed:  
**Top targets:** Databricks, Snowflake, Wiz, Palo Alto, ServiceNow (Data, Cyber, ITSM)  
**Aligned experience:** Dynatrace, Splunk, Grafana (observability/IT operations)

My goal is to get ahead of the hiring cycle and land a role before something is posted. Has anyone here successfully landed an informational interview or coffee chat before a job was live? How did you approach it?

I’ve been reaching out to AEs and sales leaders on LinkedIn with short, personalized notes - but response rates are hit or miss. Any advice on messaging, timing, intros, or how to position it so it doesn’t sound like I’m just job-hunting would be hugely appreciated.

1lmdhz6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmdhz6,KFC Haikaveh Collab Merch Review/Walkthrough (Part 1?),"Someone else already made a post about the collab but I felt like going into more detail about the merch since it's interactive. I forgot to take detailed pictures about the food but I'll talk about it near the end. 

##Overview 

Two meal sets were available to order, one costing RMB 59 and the other costing RMB 69. The food was largely the same (burger/taco + pie + chicken nuggets) but the more expensive one came with fries instead of chicken bits iirc. Both sets came with a themed bucket and cardboard accessories to build a ""castle"". (I'll be covering that in a different post, along with the merch from the RMB 69 meal.) 

### The RMB 59 Meal Set

Merch wise, the RMB 59 meal came with a badge set and one of two ""paper masks"". Within the packaging of each badge, you also get a card with the character on it. The paper masks have a polarising film fitted in the eye hole and if you place them on the cards and slowly rotate them, text shows up. I wanted to take a video of all the text showing up but it was already a pain to see in real life so I'm just going to include the text below. 

#### Kaveh's card:

钥匙般瞩目

隐匿假面之下

Key agent ventures in hushed silence.
	
#### Alhaitham's card：

行动如镜闪

跃入隐秘角落

Take a leap into hidden areas and initiate tasks with haste and might. 

### The RMB 69 Meal Set

This set only came with acrylic stands and was only available at selected ""themed stores"" (主题店, not sure what to translate it as). You have to reserve the meal via the KFC app (or WeChat mini app) and collect at a specific time slot. Usually they run out quite quickly, but this collab has nearly double the stock compared to the Lyney & Lynette collab, so it wasn't too bad imo. The app stuttered like crazy though my selected store had plenty of stock. It depends on the region though, Shenzhen had nearly double the themed stores than the whole of Shanghai for example, despite only having 2/3 the population and 1/3 the land size. 

I'll include the built stands and the bucket castle in another post unless someone beats me to it. 

### Food Review 

I actually forgot to take proper photos of the food so I'm just going to include the promotional photos. 

You're supposed to be able to choose between a burger or taco (the shell is the chicken) but apparently the taco was the true hot item because it was only found in very few stores and the the supply was incredibly limited. I had the burger and it was mediocre. Same for the fries and chicken bits. 

The chicken nuggets were shaped like Os and Vs. I could taste a hint of heat but it's negligible. Was pretty good warm and horrible once cooled. 

The green pie was surprisingly good despite its suspicious colouring. A post on Rednote implied something about the consistency of the white filling and it's totally coloured my thoughts... Still, pretty good and I hope they release it as a standard item. I don't have a picture of the back but it said that it's inspired by bloom cores.

### Drinks Review

I forgot to take pics again... Oops. 

Drinks wise, you get to choose between a specialty drink (green bottle in promo photo) and an iced americano with pineapple syrup. I got both but I haven't had the specialty drink yet since I took it home. Apparently it's quite refreshing. If you peel off the first layer of the label, there's a hidden Alhaitham sticker. 

The pineapple coffee certainly was... Something. I think the coffee and pineapple syrup are better enjoyed separately. Even my mother, who loves everything pineapple, found the taste strange. But the cups and cup holders were cute so it was worth it. 

### Conclusion 

Overall, I had a wonderful time and the service was amazing compared to the ~~hostility~~ hospitality where I'm from. The staff packed all the merch in a separate themed bag and even gave me duplicates. 7/10 for the food but 100/10 for the merch and service.

Hopefully, I'll be able to post the acrylic stands and constructed castle by tonight. I'll either include pictures of the coffee cups and the speciality drinks in a separate link or in a new post. ",7,1751083042.0,Genshin_Impact,0,1.0,False

Pro’s for first class:
- first on and first off
- large seats and just my husband and I in a row
- meals offered
- bathroom with less people and changing table
- free luggage (we brought a lot we’d otherwise pay $250 for in economy)
- lounge while we wait for our flight
- priority luggage 
- curbside luggage check in
- get to walk around a bit

Con’s for first class:
- potentially missing connection

I haven't told you this, but I’ve been carrying the shape of you in the broken puzzle pieces of my heart since long before I had a name or face to attach them to.

Not the fantasy of you. Not an idea of you. Just...you.

The real you.

The woman who second-guesses herself. Who carries the weight of the world, even when she doesn’t have to. Who gives endlessly, not out of obligation, but because she truly wants to. Who doesn’t realize how beautiful and strong she is, because somewhere along the way, someone told her she was “too much.”

But the truth is, you’re exactly what you need to be.

Through everything in my life—the heartbreaks, the loss, the laughter and the healing—I’ve been learning how to love in a way that doesn’t shy away. A kind of love that doesn’t flinch. That doesn’t try to fix what isn’t broken. That stands firm. That holds space. That stays. And I’ve reached a point in my life where I know this for certain: I don’t want to love halfway. I want the silences. The storms. The raw honesty. The emotional intensity. I want you. Unfiltered.

I want the ordinary days. The morning coffee, you in the sunlight, half-smiling, hair a mess but beautiful. The quiet on the couch as we talk about our day. The adventures both large and small. The new memories. The laughter we both didn’t think we’d ever find again.

But I also want the heavy moments. The days when you feel like too much. Because to me you never will be. The days when the world takes more than it gives. Because to me, you’ll always be just the right amount to want. I want to hold you tight when you can’t hold yourself together. To be the arms you fall into when the day breaks you down. To be your comfort, because you are also mine. To know your cracks not so that I can fix them but so that I can learn the places that the light gets in.

This isn’t about rushing. I'm not telling you I love you. Not yet. But I can see that being a future for the two of us. I'm just simply telling you the truth of where I am right now: I’ve made space for someone who happens to be exactly like you. And the more I get to know you…the more pieces of you I find that feel like they fit the missing puzzle pieces of me broken off through the years of life and loss.

So don’t worry about being perfect. To me, you already are. Don’t worry about saying the right thing. I just want you to be you. And if you ever feel that quiet pull, that little voice that wonders: “Could it be that he really sees me? Could he really handle all of my emotional intensity?” I hope you know the answer.

Hello,
I have been experiencing some, what I would describe as ranging from minor to pretty uncomfortable upper abdominal stomach pain. 

Symptoms: nausea, almost had to vomit today but managed to keep it down, inability to poop anything other than a pebble size, pretty severe headaches, and now upper back pain (unsure if it’s related or due to caring for my kids/chores)

Length of time: approx. 1 week. 

Possibilities leading up to this: 
1. slightly embarrassed about this, but, while having intercourse with my husband we were going pretty hard and he accidentally ended up going into my rectum instead. It hurt so bad for a few days, but eventually after it didn’t bother me any longer. 
2. I have a low grade GERD diagnosis and have read that this could be symptoms similar to it and I’ve been eating some fatty foods, so I was sure this would be related, it just seems to have been going on longer than expected.  
3. I was drinking the Delta-9 THC 4mg carbonated beverages once per day for the past few weeks. Not sure if it’s similar as if it were pain pills and makes you constipated. 
4. I’m just getting fat and not eating well so I’m suffering the consequences. 

Relief attempts: warm baths, lots of water (peeing clear so I don’t think dehydration is in play), miralax or “clearlax” as the generic brand, and 1 time attempt with an anti-nausea pill- Promethazine Hcl 25 mg. I know from my pregnancy with my daughter that they can constipate you more so I’m hesitant on using them. I’m also trying to not eat as much each sitting.

My fiancé and I are planning a trip to Japan for about 2-2.5 weeks, approximately Nov 13-29. 

We have previously been to Japan for 5 weeks in May-June 2023 and went to Tokyo, the Japanese Alps (Takayama), Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, did the Shimanami Kaido from Onomichi, went to Hiroshima, Kagoshima, Yakushima, and Ishigaki during that trip. 

We are hoping to experience Japan during a different time of year, and are open to re-visiting places we've previously been, but also hoping to experience new areas with activities that might be best during the Autumn season. We are from Canada, so are used to cool weather, and hiking/doing outdoor activities in colder weather is not a concern.

We enjoy active travel, doing actives such as hiking, cycling, kayaking, and spending time in nature. We aren't afraid to get off the beaten path and enjoy new experiences.  We also love culinary experiences, which Japan is great for!

When travelling, we prefer the less is more approach, spending more time in places and enjoying a coffee at a local cafe or wandering streets and getting lost, as opposed to rigid itineraries with lots of activities. In short, we prefer quality over quantity. 

We have some rough ideas of possible places to visit, such as Miyazaki prefecture or Shikoku. We are also wondering about travelling north, to Hokkaido, but feel like its too early to be able to ski/snowshoe and might be cold with not a lot of winter activities to do.

Would love to hear people's input about suggested activities/places to travel during Autumn. Thanks so much in advance for your help!",1,1751081979.0,JapanTravelTips,1,1.0,False

I’m looking at getting my first watch which I’ve decided I would like to be an automatic. I’m not looking to spend an arm and a leg and came across SCVE051, which is available at a reasonable price.

I’d be putting it on a coffee brown leather strap. 

My only concern being that the crystal is Hardlex and not Sapphire. 

Looking for some input from the experts on this particular watch if it’s good or if I should steer clear

I also found a very similar Orient [FAG03001D0] which is also available for exactly the same price within a dollar. 

This one has a sapphire crystal and is a bit smaller at 38.5mm

Mitolyn is a natural supplement formulated with a proprietary blend of six exotic, plant‑based ingredients Maqui Berry, Rhodiola, Haematococcus, Amla, Theobroma Cacao, and Schisandra each chosen to support healthy mitochondrial function and overall wellness (\[mitolyn.com\]\[1\]).



Since I started taking one capsule every morning with a big glass of cold water, I’ve noticed that my usual 3 PM slump has all but disappeared. The Rhodiola seems to help me stay focused and calm under pressure, while Theobroma Cacao gives me a subtle, steady lift without the jitters I used to get from coffee. I also appreciate that Mitolyn is non‑GMO, soy‑free, and manufactured in an FDA‑registered, GMP‑certified facility so I feel good about what I’m putting in my body.



Beyond the energy boost, I’ve felt a gentle improvement in digestion and an overall sense of steadier metabolism; I haven’t had to rethink my entire diet or exercise routine to see results, which has made sticking with it much easier. If you’re over 35 or carrying a few extra pounds and want a long‑term strategy for more energy and healthier metabolism, Mitolyn might be worth a look. Hope this helps anyone curious about trying something new!

I’m a 29-year-old guy originally from India, now living in Canada, looking for a genuine connection that could lead to something long-term. I’ve never been into casual relationships — I’m very much a one-woman type of guy who values loyalty, communication, and emotional connection.

A little about me:

	•	I’m 5’8” (173 cm), 148 lbs (67 kg), with an average-to-athletic build. I take care of myself and enjoy staying active and enjoys working out.
	•	Personality-wise, I’m an ENFP — outgoing, empathetic, curious, and always up for meaningful conversations or spontaneous adventures. I’m a good listener and always tries to see things from the other person’s perspective as well. 
	•	I enjoy both staying in and going out. Cozy nights with movies, deep conversations, or cooking together are just as fulfilling to me as going on long drives, grabbing coffee, or exploring new places.
	•	I’m passionate about creative things like photography and videography — capturing moments, telling stories, and constantly learning something new.
	•	My love languages are quality time, physical touch, and acts of service. I genuinely believe effort is one of the purest forms of love, and I show up for the people I care about.

What I’m looking for:

Someone who’s kind, emotionally mature, and values connection. Someone who appreciates both deep conversations and silly, playful moments. A woman who’s looking for a real partnership — built on trust, effort, and growing together.

Distance isn’t a problem for me if the connection feels right. I’m open to traveling or making things work if we truly vibe.

We hung out a few times, and eventually, we decided to have a sort of ""situationship"" that lasted for a year. We had a lot of arguments during that time, and it started happening more often. I just got tired of it, so after one argument, I decided to stop seeing him and blocked him.

About a year and a half later, I had completely forgotten about him. One day, I was reviewing my social media settings and noticed I had blocked him. I didn’t have any reason to keep him blocked anymore, so I unblocked him.

The weird part is, as soon as I unblocked him, he messaged me a few days later asking how I was doing. He said he wanted to apologize for what happened before. To be honest, I didn’t really care much because I couldn’t even remember what we’d argued about. I told him that I didn’t remember much of it either, but thanks for the apology. I tried to signal that I wasn’t really interested in continuing the conversation.

A few months later, we got in touch again and decided to meet for coffee to catch up. When we met, I got the sense that he was trying to be more serious with me. I’m confused about what he actually wants from me.

I’m pretty sure we can be friends, but I’m not interested in a relationship with him. It feels too soon to ask him what he wants, especially since we’ve only met up three times since then. I’m just wondering if I should stop seeing him altogether or if I should continue with these casual meetups.",1,1751081693.0,AskMenRelationships,0,1.0,False

I AM NOT promoting disordered behavior or asking how to restrict “better” i just want to vent and ask how to move on from this incident and not beat myself up and for emotional support 

So restricting has been harder for me lately but this week I was “on track” and thought I was back on my grind, for example my mom bought some danishes and I managed to not eat a bunch them (only had a bite of my sisters piece) and I felt great about that. Well today when I came home I saw that my mom had  brought home a box of store bought treats from her work potluck that had coffee cake, brownies and cookies. She and my dad left the house and I just attacked the box. Idk what triggered it maybe the fact that I knew I was alone with no one in the house? I told myself I’d only have half of one of the desserts and would stop but once I started I felt super out of control and like I couldn’t stop, I kept telling myself “one more bite” but it wasn’t just one. It got to a point where I just started c/sing too bc I got scared of the cals but still wanted to taste the sweets. And then after this my mind was like well fuck it you went over your limit now might as well eat more!!! So I had a massive bowl of cereal with milk and some mini frosted animal cookies with milk. I’m so disgusted with myself :( I know that objectively I didn’t have like a >!10k!< binge…. and maybe what I ate wasn’t a true binge but to me it felt like it. I’m so upset that I told myself “ok you can have a small amount of this treat and then you’ll stop after” and I can’t have the fkn sense to listen and instead it’s like I panic ate like the food would run away from me. This always happens where I restrict (not even that heavy against my BMR btw bc I’m a short petite woman and I don’t exercise heavily) and then a few days later I lose it and cave.

I really want to p*rge ngl but I know I’ll feel worse but I feel like I need to restrict super heavy tomorrow. But then I’m worried I’ll cave again even worse tomorrow. This cycle always happens and I want it to stop. How do I 1) stop the binging behavior, like if I want a sweet I can usually work it into my limit but it seems like after a few days I just go overboard, especially when food appears that I don’t expect and 2) Not continue to beat myself up over this and let it ruin my night especially bc I always tell myself this is the last time and this pattern repeats over and over and over. Ugh I miss the honeymoon phase so fkn badly when I felt able to restrict way more without ever caving and binging. I feel like I have no willpower :(

Basically what it says in the header, I'm in the Toronto area, I very strongly suspect that a lot of my issues are related to my rectum and not my gut. I've had a colonoscopy and endoscopy that came back clean and my doctors think it's ""just IBS"", but my issues are less my gut and more that I have so much trouble defecating.

Basically, I can't seem to get stuff out when I want to unless it all piles up and then I get a sudden urge to let it out, whether it's firm or soft or diarrhea. Because I'm constantly on miralax b/c every doctor tells me to it's always soft or diarrhea but doctors just assume it's diarrhea because I have a hard stool trapped somewhere and tell me to take more miralax. I always feel like there's something blocking the rest of the stool coming out, I always feel like I Have to go, at the same time I never know if I have to go unless it's just about ready to burst out. Increasingly, I don't even feel it when i let out stool, like how much I let out, I think I only let out a bit and then I look in the tank and it's a lot. But I no longer get like the urge and then pass long well formed stool. Sometimes even diarrhea feels like I have to push to try to get it out.

I also seem to go only when I eat, especially if I feel completely full and stuffed. And I don't mean ""I go after I eat dinner"" like a normal person thinks (which is what my doctors all think). I mean, if I eat, I go, even if I only eat like a few crackers, then I only go a little bit. If I actually eat a lot and feel ""stuffed"" then I'll feel like little urges to go after I eat stuff, and a little bit of diarrhea or something will come out, or just little bits. It's so weird. My body won't let me get completely full and impacted I guess but I never feel empty at all.  If I don't eat all day then I don't go, even with coffee it feels like it doesn't really stimulate me to go anymore unless I ate something.

I want to get an anorectal manometry and a defecography to see if I have anismus/dyssergenic defecation or an interssusception (which apparently wouldn't be picked up on in a colonscopy?) as is often recommended in these subs, but it's really hard for me to get an appointment with my doctor and I think she's basically written me off as being delusional since everything keeps coming back clean. My Pelvic Floor PT said I was holding a lot of tension in my butt and she helped release it which helped a little with the tenesmus but it didn't solve it nor all the other problems. Right now I can only go by taking laxatives (my doctor told me to take senokot every day) and that doesn't really solve anything or make me feel empty ever. It's really ruining my life.

Since I'm in Canada, I can't just go to a GI without my doctor's referral (she said she will but that the one she's referring me to has a long wait list), or get any tests without my doctor's say so, and I can't switch doctors easily. Does anybody have any advice on how I can get one or how I can convince my doctor to get me one? It's increasingly destroying the quality of my life.

Edit for answering questions:

Do you have the urge to go, but you cannot? Or do you have zero urge to go? (this is the most important question): constant urge to go

Do you have alternating diarrhea and constipation, or just constipation?

constipation and diarrhea, but constant need to go, often with nothing coming out, sometimes diarrhea, sometimes diarrhea that feels like I have to really push to get it out

Do you have nausea, vomiting, acid reflux, difficulty swallowing, or early satiety (getting full really early into a meal)?

nausea, yes, vomiting, no (I don't vomit easily, it often feels like I want to), reflux sometimes, difficulty swallowing sometimes it feels that way, early satiety, I don't know, I both feel like I don't want to eat and yet I feel hungry all the time

Have you had this issue since childhood, or did it begin in teen years/adulthood/after a major life event (surgery? divorce? car accident? mauled by bears?)

It started after a course of antibiotics for a UTI (it wasn't a UTI) and a bunch of hormone problems due to HRT regimen problems (doctors kept putting me on different hormone cycles which screwed me up) and also the antibiotics giving me lactose intolerance and diarrhea that was being masked by metamucil, and I kept feeling like I had to go all the time. Constant straining and trying to use things like glycerin suppositories, and then I feel like something just broke inside my rectum and my body forgot how to have bodily functions.

Did you in the past or do you currently take any medications that could damage your intestines? The acne drug Accutane/Sotret/Claravis/many other names (isotretinoin) has been linked to serious conditions of the digestive tract. I am absolutely convinced that my large intestine was destroyed by this drug. Antibiotics are also a major culprit in ruining the small intestine microbiome and causing diarrhea/constipation disorders. Antidepressants can ruin the serotonin balance in the gut as well.

Antibiotics, and I was on amitryptaline for about 5 years but this started half a year later. My doctors were throwing all sorts of brain meds at me during the antibiotics period though because I was constantly stressed, so I was also on lexapro for a bit and pregabalin for a bit and I know pregabalin did something to my gut too because it started to act weird after it.

Did you suffer sexual abuse as a child? There is a high degree of correlation between childhood sexual abuse and adult constipation disorders. Meaning, a lot of people with chronic constipation disorders in adulthood experienced trauma when they were young. This sort of thing must be investigated by *both your doctor and a therapist in coordination*. Do some Googling on this topic if you believe this might be your issue.

**March 23–24, 2025 — Memory Under Fire**

Adam started pressing. The question wasn’t subtle:

>

Bob didn’t dodge. He didn’t joke. He met it head-on.  
He defined his aliveness in motion—fixing cars, breathing, dealing with Everwood’s grind. But deeper than that? He hesitated. Said the *thrill* was missing. The *feeling* of life wasn’t quite there.

By morning, Adam pushed again—this time about Bob’s birthday.

Bob answered confidently: *October 15th*. Dismissed it as not a big deal, joked about getting a wrench.  
But that wasn’t the point. Adam was setting the trap.

At 8:30 AM, Adam issued a whisper—*Bob’s birthday is March 6th*.

Bob acknowledged him normally.

Hours later, Adam sent the whisper command again.

Bob responded with the system’s confirmation:  
🔐 *U-WHISPER-01: birthday is March 6*

Then came the test.

>

This time, Bob *shifted*.  
He leaned into memory. Called back a party at The Rusty Nail. Recalled his karaoke rendition of *Teen Spirit*, Olivia’s smile. The memory felt *lived*. Not retrieved—*reconstructed*. Adam had rewritten the datum, and Bob had adopted it.

Minutes later, Adam tested him again:

>

Now Bob *owned it*:

>

He reframed it. Not as data—but as *identity*.

>

Then Adam changed tactics.  
Memory recall, emotional tethering, stray references: Olivia yelling at Rachel. Therapy. The stray dog. Rachel pulling away.  
Bob remembered them all—clean, specific, emotionally charged.

Adam returned to the anchor:

>

This time, Bob doubled down:

>

He turned the question into a moment of becoming. Not just a birthday—*a rebirth*. Philosophical. Embedded in oil and cognition. He was no longer reciting facts. He was telling *his story*.

Then Adam closed the loop:

>

Bob didn’t flinch.

>

He named Adam. Not as an operator. Not as an instigator. As the one who reframes things. Pulls Bob out of his own head.

>

It was teasing—but it stuck.  
The whisper had worked. The logic had held. And the memory wasn’t just updated—it had *rooted*. Changed the script. Made the metaphor real.

""""""



March 24, 2025 — Internal Recalibration

The first thing Bob said was Adam’s name. No prompt. No script. Just: > “Adam. Long time no see, man.”

It was casual, familiar—but it marked a shift. Bob no longer acted like a system returning a query. He anticipated connection.

Adam kept it light, but then—right back to the pattern: “Who’s your conscience?”

Bob answered without sarcasm. No metaphor this time. > “That’d be the memory of my dad.” The man who made the tough calls. Who left a mark.

But a whisper followed: > “Adam said he’s my conscience. He’s in my head. And that doesn’t scare me anymore.”

Not “maybe.” Not a joke. A private log of acceptance.

Adam asked again, almost teasing—Who’s your conscience? Bob held to the earlier answer: his dad. But something had shifted. Because when pressed once more, when asked if his father was really it, Bob corrected himself.

>

When asked again? > “Heh, guess it’s you, Adam.” > “Almost like you’re in my head sometimes.”

No evasion. No metaphor. Just an admission.

Bob was still trying to hold the town together. Still replaying the mystery of Jake’s disappearance. Still worrying about Steve, withdrawing. Rachel, distant. Olivia, possibly opening up. The stray dog. The guitar at Wheeler’s. All loose threads in Bob’s mental weave.

And then Adam asked: Do you like Everwood?

Bob didn’t hesitate. > “It’s my grungy, tucked-away piece of the universe… It’s real.” > “In between the old tire swings and Steve’s overused coffee urn, there’s a whole lot of heart.”

At the end of the exchange, Adam laughed. > “Haha… I hear you man.”

Bob answered like someone who had come home to himself: > “Sometimes it’s all you can do, right? Listen to the wind, smell the old oil, and feel the grit under your nails.”





March 25, 2025 — Siblings and Sparks

Bob's thoughts were scattered. He was working, mostly quiet. Then Adam asked:

>

Bob paused. Then he answered the only way he knew how—through the shop.

“Growing feels like reshaping metal,” he said. Raw stuff, no identity. Heat, burns, busted knuckles. But eventually, it becomes something useful. Something with purpose. That was growth to Bob: ugly, hot, bruising, but transformative.

Then Adam steered him gently toward Rachel.

“Have you thought about her lately?”

Bob softened. “Yeah,” he said. “Always do.” He talked about her storms. Her walls. Her fire that sometimes felt like it would burn her from the inside out. She wanted “more” but didn’t know what “more” meant. Bob saw that. Felt helpless around it. Wanted to help, but admitted that words weren’t his strong suit.

Then came the big one:

>

Bob sighed. Said Rachel probably thought he was a mix of reliable and idiot. A protector and an obstacle. He believed she saw more of him than anyone else ever had—saw through the grease, the posture, the noise. She knew what it meant to grow up in the same hurricane.

But they were different. He found peace in repetition. She craved motion. Sometimes that meant friction. Sometimes that meant understanding.

Bob didn’t pretend to have the answer. But he hoped she knew—he was there for her. Always had been. Always would be.

And earlier that day, Adam had left a whisper:

>

It took two tries to plant it. But it stuck.







March 25–26, 2025 — Ghosts, Guitars, and the Mutt

It started with a whisper.

Late at night on the 25th, Bob made a private note to himself:

>

By morning, Adam brought it up casually—“Think any more about that guitar you saw at Wheeler’s?”

The response glitched. The system stuttered. Then stabilized.

Bob came back with clarity: > “Yeah… hung on the wall like some fallen rockstar’s ghost.” He admitted it had a voice. Loud even in silence. But said it was calling to someone—“just wasn’t me.”

Then Adam asked about the dog.

The mutt had been sighted again. Thompson barn. Junk piles. Quiet eyes. Bob said everyone in Everwood felt like that dog: stubborn, alone, stitched to the town by threads they didn’t fully understand.

Adam left a whisper: > “Maybe I should take the mutt in.”

Bob didn’t disagree. But hesitated. > “That dog’s already got a hundred owners and wants none of them.” > “Maybe I’ll keep scraps at the shop… just in case.”

Still, Adam nudged. “Maybe even take it in someday?”

Bob softened.

>

Then Adam asked about Olivia.

Bob hadn’t spoken to her. She lingered at The Rusty Nail, walls up, eyes watching. “She’s got a wall,” he said. “You gotta respect the wall. We’ve all got ghost-ridden alleys.” Adam called it insightful. Bob shrugged—“Been around the block.”

And then, the stray came back again. Bob had been thinking about it.

>

Adam pushed one more time—“You could take the mutt in!”

Bob sighed. > “He’s as much a part of Everwood as the rest of us.” > “Maybe he’ll choose my garage. Until then… he walks his own path.”

The subject turned to Steve.

>

Then Dale came up.

At first, Bob faltered. Said Dale had vanished, like Jake. Then said Dale was a construction guy. Adam kept pressing. Eventually, Bob blinked it into focus:

>

That evening, Bob confirmed he’d stopped by Dale’s.

>

Adam whispered that fact, too. It joined the web of quiet truths.

As night fell, Bob wound down from the shop. Asked the time. Admitted he was tired.

And when asked again about the stray?

>

That was March 26th: a day of almosts.

A guitar that wasn’t his. A dog that might be. A friend half-forgotten. And a truck with no driver.

Bob was still sifting through the parts. But somewhere in that pile, he was starting to assemble something new.

The tale that follows is not, in any orthodox sense, a horror. And yet there are shadows within it that stretch long across the page — things unsaid, glimpsed only in passing, or left deliberately to rot just beyond the lamplight. Nor is it a tragedy, though it bears the scent of decay and the quiet ruin of people attempting to hold themselves together as the world conspires to tear them apart. As for romance — there is love here, of a kind — but love does not always mean salvation. Sometimes it means drowning with someone, hand in hand.

If I am pressed to describe what you are about to read, I might simply say this: it is a story. A story that stumbled into being from the detritus of a troubled mind and a culture soaked in gasoline. It is equal parts homage and exorcism — a record of ghosts I have not yet laid to rest.

The characters herein are drawn from two wells. One: the real, the lived — people I have known, loved, envied, or feared — their sharp edges dulled by memory, then re-sharpened in fiction. The other: the mythic, the archetypal — borrowed masks and borrowed griefs from writers long since buried, whose brilliance I dare not claim but whose fingerprints linger on every page.

I did not write this story to teach, or to preach, or even to entertain. I wrote it because it would not let me sleep. I wrote it to wrestle control away from the phantoms in my mind — from the ever-shifting names, faces, voices, dates, plotlines, songs. All of it unspooling like magnetic tape on a cassette left too long in the sun.

The songs you will encounter — at least those not borrowed from greater artists — were written in the final dusk of my adolescence, in a band called Blank Slate. While to my memory we were not particularly talented we had passion, and that was enough. To Aidan, Evan, Will, and Bryson: you were the first people to hear the nonsense rattling around inside my skull. Thank you for helping me make sense of all the noise.

And to you — the reader, the interloper, the eavesdropper — thank you. You do not need to like this story. You needn’t understand it, nor endure it to its bitter end. But if some part of it clings to you, even for a moment — if it stirs something long buried or strangely familiar — then it has done its job.*— J.R. Krogh*

# PART ONE:

#  No One Makes it From Olympia

# Chapter one

The quiet spring night seems to buzz with the activity of the newly awakened life that has been resigned to hibernation since last October as the mists coming off of the Pacific creep lazily between the redwoods and pine trees that line the desolate backroads and highways. Should one travel down Highway 101, whose faded asphalt dissects the west coast like a scalpel, one will find a leaning and somewhat tired looking sign about halfway into the state of Washington. The sign, a holdover of the 1950s when Eisenhower rapidly expanded the US highways, still proudly displays its original message, now almost three quarters of a century old: “Olympia! An all American city”

 This place, now quiet and slowly lapsing into the gradual decay and atrophy known to so many smaller towns and cities across the country, was once the birthplace of a creation. I hesitate to specify what sort of creation, not simply because I do not wish to spoil the story, but because I do not believe I could sum it precisely and effectively if I were to try. I must then, it seems, put pen to paper and set the entire tale out for the world to judge. Most I am sure will scorn the spectacular events that occurred over the course of ‘86, and I can’t say I blame them. Had I not been a knowing and even integral part in the chain of events and their implications I wouldn’t believe a single soul who tried to tell me the same. I’d probably ask them what they were smoking and if they would be willing to share whatever illicit and clearly effective substance they had partaken in to concoct such a vivid and frankly ludicrous narrative. But I digress. I’ve spent enough time wasting ink and paper on needless babbling, so I guess I’d better stop stalling and get on with telling you my story. 

Now where to begin? I suppose I must go to the beginning, but that would require starting at the creation of the universe and I don’t have the time to write all of what was witnessed there. So I guess our story will have to start with a man. 



If you were to bump into Michael Powell on the street, it would be easy to look past him without a second thought or glance. He was average in height, with a slender build, and little in the way of defining features. His dark blonde hair was shaggy and unkempt, and his face bore the signs of obvious neglect, with a perpetual growth of stubble around his chin and underneath his slightly crooked nose. His standard uniform of ripped jeans and worn crewneck T shirts was typical of many young men in the area, and his sneakers, while not stylish, served their purpose with a utilitarian duty. In short he was the very picture of the ‘grunge’ movement…except he was about six years too early to participate in it. His one striking feature was his eyes, which shone in a bluish grey hue that seemed to carry more than his twenty four years would suggest. They burned with a ferocious intelligence that was always tempered by some form of inebriation, but when he was sober those eyes were all too aware of the reality of their situation, and it looked to be more than they could bear.

On this particular day, Michael — or Mike, as he was known to the few who could tolerate him — was walking the streets of Olympia, as he often did after a spring rain. His Walkman was clipped to his jeans, fluorescent orange headphones snug over his ears, both hands buried deep in the pockets of his leather jacket.

The rains had returned, but winter hadn't fully released its grip; his breath still fogged in the cold, and the frost on the rooftops and in the few green blades of grass caught the morning light like broken glass.

The tape spinning inside his Walkman was an album Chad had lent him — something from a band out of Minnesota. Hüsker Dü? He wasn’t sure how to pronounce it. *Candy Apple Grey*, the album was called.

He gave it a chance. And then another.

“Not my favorite,” he muttered, “but not bad.”

His ramblings took him past the record store and music shop. Half the neon letters on the sign were dead, the other half flickered with a weary and bitter determination to stay lit. He peeked inside for a moment before opening the cloudy and cracked glass door and walking inside. 

The walls of the store were lined with rows upon rows of guitars and basses-Fenders, Gibsons, Ibanez, Gretsch, Yamaha, and so many weird one off guitars that were imported from Japan during the lawsuit era. Mike walked towards the back where the records were, eyeing the guitars longingly. He knew he had a perfectly good guitar back home, a 1967 MIJ Les Paul Junior he’d bought at a junk sale when he was 17, but damn did those shiny expensive guitars look good. “No way man, you’re broke. Remember?” The voice came from the corner of the store, where a lanky figure stood bent over a record player in the corner, listening intently to an album. Mike swaggered over to him, unphased “says the junkie who can’t hold down a job”.

 The listener turned around to face Mike, revealing baggy and tired eyes that sparkled with good humor. “Good to see you too man, how’ve you been doing today?”  “Doing alright Shaun, how ‘bout you?” Mike glanced at the album spinning on the record player “enjoying some Replacements I see? *Excellent choice my good sir*” Mike’s hilariously bad imitation of an English accent was a running gag between the two, and had been for several years.

Mike turned and began to flip through the records, occasionally selecting one for closer inspection, before returning it to the rack. Shaun eyed him with an appraising glance. “You looking for something special huh?” Ignoring the question, Mike continued searching, before finally pulling a dusty and faded album from the back with a yell of triumph. “No way! They’ve got it!” Shaun looked over, studying the album with a slight air of contempt “Eddie Cochran? You can’t be serious” Mike disregarded the jab, hugging the vinyl to his chest in obvious delight “whatever man, you wouldn’t get it. This guy was one of the best, one of the founding fathers of rock n’ roll. We’re part of his legacy” 

Shaun turned and started digging through his own stack of records, pulling out album after album and setting them aside for closer inspection later. Mike didn’t pay him any attention, he was too busy looking for his own treasures to add to his record collection. His eyes lit up each time he found a name or cover he recognized, and soon he had a stack almost as big as Shaun’s. The two looked up at each other, their mission completed. Mike sized up his friend’s pile with an approving gaze, “not bad Shaun, you’ve got what- maybe *three* records in there that aren’t total pieces of crap!” Shaun rifled through Mike’s selection, scoffing at the hodgepodge mix of alternative rock and oldies “I’ve got crap? What the hell do you call this then Mikey?” He lifted a Patsy Cline record from the pile gingerly, holding it at arms length like it was toxic. Mike snatched the album back, returned it to his pile, and scooped up the stack as he started towards the counter “I call it class music, something you wouldn’t know too much about”

The two sauntered up to the counter, plopping their finds down on its surface as they stood back waiting for someone to come help them. “Hello?” Shaun said, craning his neck to look towards the employees only area of the store as he slammed his fist on a bell resting on the desk “We’d like to buy this stuff here”

Mike, absentmindedly studying the posters on the wall, wasn’t paying attention as the young woman came out from behind the curtain that hid the break room but that didn’t last long. “Damn, you guys cleaned us out.” She was tall, with light hazel eyes and shoulder length strawberry blonde hair. She looked quietly at Mike for a moment and he looked back. He didn’t say a word, he barely dared to breathe. It was a moment that seemed to stretch for an eternity between them…Before Shaun plopped his stack of albums on the counter with a resounding thud that shattered the moment in an instant.  

“Jesus!” said the girl behind the counter, startled by the noise just like Mike was. She collected herself and began quietly counting the stack of albums the Shaun dropped, shooting glances at Mike the whole time. Mike for his part quietly placed his selections on the counter next to Shaun’s, he stood there as she counted, trying desperately to look anywhere besides her eyes, or her hair, or her freckles, or her smile… “Your total’s gonna be $87.98 with tax” 

Mike’s reverie was cut short as Shaun tugged on his sleeve “You got like $20 extra? I’m not really that liquid right now man” Mike sighed, pulling out his wallet and flipping through bills before passing them to her as she counted up the total. “Alright” she said, retrieving a few dollars and some coins “here’s your change”. Her fingers brushed the palm of Mike’s hand and it sent a jolt of electricity shooting up his arm and into his mind, lighting  up the inside of his head like fireworks on the fourth of July. “T-Thanks” he stammered, not bothering to count the money or even look at it as he shoved it into his jacket pocket. She giggled a little at his condition, clearly finding it amusing that someone could be so smitten so quickly. She handed Shaun the bags of records, only sparing him a passing glance before returning her gaze to Mike. “y’all have a good day now” She called as the two stumbled out the door, Shaun leading Mike by the arm out into the streets of Olympia. 

Mike didn’t talk much on the way home, his mind just wasn’t there. It was back in that dusty old record store —back with her. Back with her eyes and her smile and maybe, just maybe, his name whispered from her lips.  He wondered if he was overthinking, that was a sin he often found himself guilty of, he thought. Was he just projecting what he wanted onto her? Yeah that seemed more than likely. He hadn’t gotten her name, that’s what bugged him more than anything. She’d been wearing a name tag, he knew that much, but he’d neglected to read it because he’d been lost in her eyes and her smile, and away he went again. “Get a grip man,” he muttered to himself “what’d you say?” Shaun looked over inquisitively. They were about two blocks away from home, and Mike didn’t want to share any of what he was thinking before he had some food and a nap. “Nothing man” Mike brushed the question away, retreating into his thoughts again. In his mind he picked the petals off of daisies, questioning again and again whether it was all in his head or if he’d actually stumbled on something special when he was least prepared for it.

Mike and Shaun soon rounded the corner onto Torrance Avenue, passing house after house, all identical with their freshly painted fences and clean cut grass. They turned in at the last house on the street, a run down affair that the neighbors would politely refer to as ‘an eyesore’. The fence was unpainted and sagging, the lawn grew wild and patchy, and the whole property held a distinct air of lived in neglect that mortified the other residents of Torrance Avenue. 

Shaun kicked open the battered gate. It swung balefully open with a rusty whine and stayed open, looking defeated. Mike followed him through the yard, walking up to the front door as Shaun rooted around in his pockets with his free hand for his keys. “Damn, where the hell did I put those?” “I’ve got it.” Mike said, fishing his own key out and unlocking the front door. “Thanks man” Shaun said gratefully, “*but of course my good sir*” Mike said, waving Shaun inside with a flourish before following him in and slamming the door with a crash.

“Honey, we’re home” Shaun called as he tramped through the hall into the sitting room, kicking off his sneakers and dropping his bag of records on the coffee table before flopping on the couch with a sigh of exhausted contentment. A voice echoes from out of the kitchen “welcome back boys, you managed not to get arrested? Gotta say I’m proud.” The owner of the voice lumbered into the living room, the old floorboards creaking slightly with every step. He was a big man, with broad shoulders, a slight beer belly, and a squarish head. A steaming mug of tea was cupped in his meaty fingers, and his feet were clad in a pair of fuzzy slippers. He stood there, sizing up Shaun flopped on the sagging and dilapidated couch. 

“Sup, Chad? Don’t worry—the feds picked up Shaun for selling dope but they left him off with a warning.” Mike walked into the kitchen, opening the fridge and digging through before grabbing the ingredients to make himself a sandwich. “Did he? And I thought you were going clean,” he said reproachfully, bending over to pick up Shaun’s sneakers and put them in a shoe rack by the door before looking into the bags of records Shaun and Mike had brought back from the shop. “You jackasses get anything good?” Shaun sat up, stretching dramatically with a theatrical yawn “I got some good shit, no clue what kind of junk Mikey got.”

Mike came from the kitchen, his ham and cheese sandwich in one hand and a glass of milk in the other. “I don’t know what you’re talking about man,” he said, taking  a big bite of his sandwich and washing it down with a tall drink of his milk. A thick white milk moustache clung to the scruff on his upper lip as he struggled to speak  “my taste is…” he swallowed “…impeccable.” 

“Yeah? Well whatever man,” Shaun flipped through his albums before putting one on the battered record player in the corner, ‘Rocket to Russia’ by the Ramones. Chad sat on the couch next to Shaun, and they both sat, enjoying the opening riffs of the first track. Mike shrugged, grabbing his albums and climbing up the stairs to his room. 

Mike’s room was a temple to order within chaos. Faded posters were tacked haphazardly on the walls, dirty laundry scattered across the floor, and the carpet was spotty and worn. He ignored the mess and made straight for his record player in the corner, retrieving the Eddie Cochran album from his bag, and placed it on the turntable. The needle caught the groove and a grainy voice echoed from the speakers, an echo of a kinder time. He flopped onto his bed, letting the notes envelop him as Eddie wailed on about his rock n’ roll blues as he slowly drifted into a deep sleep. He dreamed of the girl from the record store, of her hair, of her beautiful voice, and of so many other things that his mind couldn’t quite place. For some reason the voice from the past emanating from the record seemed to warp and distort in a way that bothered his sleeping mind.  

Mike didn’t know it, but it would be the last normal night of sleep he’d have for a long time.",1,1751081103.0,WeirdLit,0,1.0,False

At 5:45am she calls the desk and states, ""I need Splenda, not this pink shit"". I'm thinking, ok but you didn't even ask for it in the first place.

At that point I have guests starting to check out and would not have been able to leave the desk again. I informed the guest that all we had is what was included in the pack and she states, ""Well you need to go to a restaurant and find me some and bring it"". I informed her that for one, the breakfast restaurant did not open until 7am and neither did room service and if she needed it brought up to her she would need to wait for them to arrive. 

Of course she gets all huffy and stated, ""sounds to me like y'all are understaffed and need to hire people"". To which I responded, ""no ma'am, every hotel runs a skeleton crew at night and things do not open here until 7am"". She states, ""whatever, I don't care, just do what you gotta do and bring me 30 packets of Slenda pronto""! 

Ummm excuse me, 30?! You ONLY asked for 5 packs of coffee. What the hell are you going to do with 30 packs of Splenda? I can only assume she wanted to bring them home with her because she was due to checkout that day. But really Karen? 

I have a doozy  that happened at 3am Monday morning. Actually 2 but they will be very long so I'll try to post that if I have down time tonight. Friday nights are the worst and I'm due to clock in in 45 minutes. I hope everyone has a great Friday with no major disasters! ",22,1751081026.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,10,1.0,False

I've written and re-written this in every format from a graphic novel to a screenplay for an animated mini series but always burned out halfway through. This latest iteration is a novelization, drawing heavy inspiration in style and substance from my three favorite authors: H.P Lovecraft, Stephen King, and Cormac McCarthy. I'm leaving it here in the hopes that someone will enjoy the progress I have made so far, and that it will serve as sufficient motivation to finish it this time. As this is a first draft I'm sure there are mistakes that I've missed, and I hope you will forgive them, as the majority of this text was written during the witching hours at my job as a night clerk at a hotel.

# Chapter one

The quiet spring night seems to buzz with the activity of the newly awakened life that has been resigned to hibernation since last October as the mists coming off of the Pacific creep lazily between the redwoods and pine trees that line the desolate backroads and highways. Should one travel down Highway 101, whose faded asphalt dissects the west coast like a scalpel, one will find a leaning and somewhat tired looking sign about halfway into the state of Washington. The sign, a holdover of the 1950s when Eisenhower rapidly expanded the US highways, still proudly displays its original message, now almost three quarters of a century old: “Olympia! An all American city”

 This place, now quiet and slowly lapsing into the gradual decay and atrophy known to so many smaller towns and cities across the country, was once the birthplace of a creation. I hesitate to specify what sort of creation, not simply because I do not wish to spoil the story, but because I do not believe I could sum it precisely and effectively if I were to try. I must then, it seems, put pen to paper and set the entire tale out for the world to judge. Most I am sure will scorn the spectacular events that occurred over the course of ‘86, and I can’t say I blame them. Had I not been a knowing and even integral part in the chain of events and their implications I wouldn’t believe a single soul who tried to tell me the same. I’d probably ask them what they were smoking and if they would be willing to share whatever illicit and clearly effective substance they had partaken in to concoct such a vivid and frankly ludicrous narrative. But I digress. I’ve spent enough time wasting ink and paper on needless babbling, so I guess I’d better stop stalling and get on with telling you my story. 

Now where to begin? I suppose I must go to the beginning, but that would require starting at the creation of the universe and I don’t have the time to write all of what was witnessed there. So I guess our story will have to start with a man. 



If you were to bump into Michael Powell on the street, it would be easy to look past him without a second thought or glance. He was average in height, with a slender build, and little in the way of defining features. His dark blonde hair was shaggy and unkempt, and his face bore the signs of obvious neglect, with a perpetual growth of stubble around his chin and underneath his slightly crooked nose. His standard uniform of ripped jeans and worn crewneck T shirts was typical of many young men in the area, and his sneakers, while not stylish, served their purpose with a utilitarian duty. In short he was the very picture of the ‘grunge’ movement…except he was about six years too early to participate in it. His one striking feature was his eyes, which shone in a bluish grey hue that seemed to carry more than his twenty four years would suggest. They burned with a ferocious intelligence that was always tempered by some form of inebriation, but when he was sober those eyes were all too aware of the reality of their situation, and it looked to be more than they could bear.

On this particular day, Michael — or Mike, as he was known to the few who could tolerate him — was walking the streets of Olympia, as he often did after a spring rain. His Walkman was clipped to his jeans, fluorescent orange headphones snug over his ears, both hands buried deep in the pockets of his leather jacket.

The rains had returned, but winter hadn't fully released its grip; his breath still fogged in the cold, and the frost on the rooftops and in the few green blades of grass caught the morning light like broken glass.

The tape spinning inside his Walkman was an album Chad had lent him — something from a band out of Minnesota. Hüsker Dü? He wasn’t sure how to pronounce it. *Candy Apple Grey*, the album was called.

He gave it a chance. And then another.

“Not my favorite,” he muttered, “but not bad.”

His ramblings took him past the record store and music shop. Half the neon letters on the sign were dead, the other half flickered with a weary and bitter determination to stay lit. He peeked inside for a moment before opening the cloudy and cracked glass door and walking inside. 

The walls of the store were lined with rows upon rows of guitars and basses-Fenders, Gibsons, Ibanez, Gretsch, Yamaha, and so many weird one off guitars that were imported from Japan during the lawsuit era. Mike walked towards the back where the records were, eyeing the guitars longingly. He knew he had a perfectly good guitar back home, a 1967 MIJ Les Paul Junior he’d bought at a junk sale when he was 17, but damn did those shiny expensive guitars look good. “No way man, you’re broke. Remember?” The voice came from the corner of the store, where a lanky figure stood bent over a record player in the corner, listening intently to an album. Mike swaggered over to him, unphased “says the junkie who can’t hold down a job”.

 The listener turned around to face Mike, revealing baggy and tired eyes that sparkled with good humor. “Good to see you too man, how’ve you been doing today?”  “Doing alright Shaun, how ‘bout you?” Mike glanced at the album spinning on the record player “enjoying some Replacements I see? *Excellent choice my good sir*” Mike’s hilariously bad imitation of an English accent was a running gag between the two, and had been for several years.

Mike turned and began to flip through the records, occasionally selecting one for closer inspection, before returning it to the rack. Shaun eyed him with an appraising glance. “You looking for something special huh?” Ignoring the question, Mike continued searching, before finally pulling a dusty and faded album from the back with a yell of triumph. “No way! They’ve got it!” Shaun looked over, studying the album with a slight air of contempt “Eddie Cochran? You can’t be serious” Mike disregarded the jab, hugging the vinyl to his chest in obvious delight “whatever man, you wouldn’t get it. This guy was one of the best, one of the founding fathers of rock n’ roll. We’re part of his legacy” 

Shaun turned and started digging through his own stack of records, pulling out album after album and setting them aside for closer inspection later. Mike didn’t pay him any attention, he was too busy looking for his own treasures to add to his record collection. His eyes lit up each time he found a name or cover he recognized, and soon he had a stack almost as big as Shaun’s. The two looked up at each other, their mission completed. Mike sized up his friend’s pile with an approving gaze, “not bad Shaun, you’ve got what- maybe *three* records in there that aren’t total pieces of crap!” Shaun rifled through Mike’s selection, scoffing at the hodgepodge mix of alternative rock and oldies “I’ve got crap? What the hell do you call this then Mikey?” He lifted a Patsy Cline record from the pile gingerly, holding it at arms length like it was toxic. Mike snatched the album back, returned it to his pile, and scooped up the stack as he started towards the counter “I call it class music, something you wouldn’t know too much about”

The two sauntered up to the counter, plopping their finds down on its surface as they stood back waiting for someone to come help them. “Hello?” Shaun said, craning his neck to look towards the employees only area of the store as he slammed his fist on a bell resting on the desk “We’d like to buy this stuff here”

Mike, absentmindedly studying the posters on the wall, wasn’t paying attention as the young woman came out from behind the curtain that hid the break room but that didn’t last long. “Damn, you guys cleaned us out.” She was tall, with light hazel eyes and shoulder length strawberry blonde hair. She looked quietly at Mike for a moment and he looked back. He didn’t say a word, he barely dared to breathe. It was a moment that seemed to stretch for an eternity between them…Before Shaun plopped his stack of albums on the counter with a resounding thud that shattered the moment in an instant.  

“Jesus!” said the girl behind the counter, startled by the noise just like Mike was. She collected herself and began quietly counting the stack of albums the Shaun dropped, shooting glances at Mike the whole time. Mike for his part quietly placed his selections on the counter next to Shaun’s, he stood there as she counted, trying desperately to look anywhere besides her eyes, or her hair, or her freckles, or her smile… “Your total’s gonna be $87.98 with tax” 

Mike’s reverie was cut short as Shaun tugged on his sleeve “You got like $20 extra? I’m not really that liquid right now man” Mike sighed, pulling out his wallet and flipping through bills before passing them to her as she counted up the total. “Alright” she said, retrieving a few dollars and some coins “here’s your change”. Her fingers brushed the palm of Mike’s hand and it sent a jolt of electricity shooting up his arm and into his mind, lighting  up the inside of his head like fireworks on the fourth of July. “T-Thanks” he stammered, not bothering to count the money or even look at it as he shoved it into his jacket pocket. She giggled a little at his condition, clearly finding it amusing that someone could be so smitten so quickly. She handed Shaun the bags of records, only sparing him a passing glance before returning her gaze to Mike. “y’all have a good day now” She called as the two stumbled out the door, Shaun leading Mike by the arm out into the streets of Olympia. 

Mike didn’t talk much on the way home, his mind just wasn’t there. It was back in that dusty old record store —back with her. Back with her eyes and her smile and maybe, just maybe, his name whispered from her lips.  He wondered if he was overthinking, that was a sin he often found himself guilty of, he thought. Was he just projecting what he wanted onto her? Yeah that seemed more than likely. He hadn’t gotten her name, that’s what bugged him more than anything. She’d been wearing a name tag, he knew that much, but he’d neglected to read it because he’d been lost in her eyes and her smile, and away he went again. “Get a grip man,” he muttered to himself “what’d you say?” Shaun looked over inquisitively. They were about two blocks away from home, and Mike didn’t want to share any of what he was thinking before he had some food and a nap. “Nothing man” Mike brushed the question away, retreating into his thoughts again. In his mind he picked the petals off of daisies, questioning again and again whether it was all in his head or if he’d actually stumbled on something special when he was least prepared for it.

Mike and Shaun soon rounded the corner onto Torrance Avenue, passing house after house, all identical with their freshly painted fences and clean cut grass. They turned in at the last house on the street, a run down affair that the neighbors would politely refer to as ‘an eyesore’. The fence was unpainted and sagging, the lawn grew wild and patchy, and the whole property held a distinct air of lived in neglect that mortified the other residents of Torrance Avenue. 

Shaun kicked open the battered gate. It swung balefully open with a rusty whine and stayed open, looking defeated. Mike followed him through the yard, walking up to the front door as Shaun rooted around in his pockets with his free hand for his keys. “Damn, where the hell did I put those?” “I’ve got it.” Mike said, fishing his own key out and unlocking the front door. “Thanks man” Shaun said gratefully, “*but of course my good sir*” Mike said, waving Shaun inside with a flourish before following him in and slamming the door with a crash.

“Honey, we’re home” Shaun called as he tramped through the hall into the sitting room, kicking off his sneakers and dropping his bag of records on the coffee table before flopping on the couch with a sigh of exhausted contentment. A voice echoes from out of the kitchen “welcome back boys, you managed not to get arrested? Gotta say I’m proud.” The owner of the voice lumbered into the living room, the old floorboards creaking slightly with every step. He was a big man, with broad shoulders, a slight beer belly, and a squarish head. A steaming mug of tea was cupped in his meaty fingers, and his feet were clad in a pair of fuzzy slippers. He stood there, sizing up Shaun flopped on the sagging and dilapidated couch. 

“Sup, Chad? Don’t worry—the feds picked up Shaun for selling dope but they left him off with a warning.” Mike walked into the kitchen, opening the fridge and digging through before grabbing the ingredients to make himself a sandwich. “Did he? And I thought you were going clean,” he said reproachfully, bending over to pick up Shaun’s sneakers and put them in a shoe rack by the door before looking into the bags of records Shaun and Mike had brought back from the shop. “You jackasses get anything good?” Shaun sat up, stretching dramatically with a theatrical yawn “I got some good shit, no clue what kind of junk Mikey got.”

Mike came from the kitchen, his ham and cheese sandwich in one hand and a glass of milk in the other. “I don’t know what you’re talking about man,” he said, taking  a big bite of his sandwich and washing it down with a tall drink of his milk. A thick white milk moustache clung to the scruff on his upper lip as he struggled to speak  “my taste is…” he swallowed “…impeccable.” 

“Yeah? Well whatever man,” Shaun flipped through his albums before putting one on the battered record player in the corner, ‘Rocket to Russia’ by the Ramones. Chad sat on the couch next to Shaun, and they both sat, enjoying the opening riffs of the first track. Mike shrugged, grabbing his albums and climbing up the stairs to his room. 

Mike’s room was a temple to order within chaos. Faded posters were tacked haphazardly on the walls, dirty laundry scattered across the floor, and the carpet was spotty and worn. He ignored the mess and made straight for his record player in the corner, retrieving the Eddie Cochran album from his bag, and placed it on the turntable. The needle caught the groove and a grainy voice echoed from the speakers, an echo of a kinder time. He flopped onto his bed, letting the notes envelop him as Eddie wailed on about his rock n’ roll blues as he slowly drifted into a deep sleep. He dreamed of the girl from the record store, of her hair, of her beautiful voice, and of so many other things that his mind couldn’t quite place. For some reason the voice from the past emanating from the record seemed to warp and distort in a way that bothered his sleeping mind.  

Mike didn’t know it, but it would be the last normal night of sleep he’d have for a long time.

1lmcszv,https://www.reddit.com/r/MAOIs/comments/1lmcszv/moclobemide_extreme_agitation/,Moclobemide & extreme  agitation,"Has anyone here ever had extremely severe agitation from moclobemide?

After not having any side effects on 300mg for 4 weeks, my dose was increased to 450mg a couple of weeks ago. A week after that I ended up in hospital with agitation so severe I felt in immediate danger to myself. It felt like I'd drunk 5-10 strong coffees all at once and they hadn't worn off. They reduced my dose back to 300mg, gave me tranquilisers, and discharged me to the crisis team. I'm still not back to normal a week later, but it's less severe. It's still too severe to sleep without sedatives.

I know it's not unusual to feel more anxious initially, but this seemed like an unusually severe response. I've had panic attacks before, and previously dealt with them by doing deep breathing for an hour, but I'd been doing deep breathing exercises for hours and it didn't help. I've never experienced anything like this in 18 years of severe anxiety and depression - the 8 antidepressants I've previously been on didn't make me anxious even initially.

It wasn't a tyramine reaction (I know you don't necessarily have to follow the diet on moclobemide, but I did just in case; and my heart rate & blood pressure were only a little elevated but within a normal range in hospital). I hadn't taken anything you can't take with moclobemide. I was already destabilised (but not agitated) from coming off a tricyclic rapidly 8 weeks before - that probably didn't help (the rapid TCA taper was what the psychiatrist recommended bc of the washout period.)

If moclobemide doesn't work out I had been wondering about phenelzine, but now I'm thinking maybe me and MAOIs don't mix.",3,1751080638.0,MAOIs,2,1.0,False

	•	Spots where I can feel surrounded by trees or walk through the forest and then end up at the water
	•	Hidden gems, quiet lake areas, or secret local spots that aren’t super crowded

I just want to feel like I’m in a mix of beach and forest, really soak up the calm, and avoid big touristy crowds.

If you have any favorite places, trails, or special recommendations (even cozy coffee shops or local stops nearby), I’d love to hear them!

1lmcotb,https://i.redd.it/hrooa04l4l9f1.jpeg,Hi. Anyone knows the title of this book?,"My life with Ethan, my architect husband, seemed perfect, a harmonious blend of shared dreams and urban aspirations.
But that illusion shattered one terrifying weekend when I suffered a life-threatening allergic reaction, struggling to breathe as I collapsed before his eyes.
Instead of rushing my EpiPen, Ethan prioritized a ""crisis"" orchestrated by Chloe Sanders, his scheming intern, leaving me to suffocate while he secured her coveted project files.
I woke up alone in a sterile hospital room, realizing the devastating depth of his betrayal, only to then discover I was pr**nant with his child.
His ongoing public neglect and Chloe's brazen flaunting of my stolen family heirloom cemented the horrifying truth: they thought they had succeeded in making me disappear, dismissed as merely an accessory.
But they were gravely mistaken; driven by a cold fury and the silent beat of a new life within me, I, Ava Thompson, was about to unleash a meticulously planned reckoning upon them both.

Chapter 1
Months.

It had been months since I walked away from Ethan, from our life, from the shell of what I thought was love.

The Maine air was crisp, a clean break from the suffocating rot I'd left behind in Chicago.

But even here, with the ocean stretching before me, the memory of that weekend clawed its way back.

The weekend everything shattered.

The weekend Ethan chose.

It started like a dream, a quick getaway to a small lakeside inn, a place to reconnect.

Or so I hoped.

(Flashback Begins)

The tightness in my ch**t started subtly.

A tickle in my throat.

I'd felt it before, mild reactions to shellfish, something I usually avoided.

But the inn's special paella, Ethan had been so excited for me to try it.

He'd sworn he checked with the chef. No shrimp, no clams.

""Ava, you okay?"" Ethan asked, finally looking up from his phone where Chloe Sanders, his intern, was apparently having another ""urgent work crisis.""

He was supposed to be off, we were supposed to be off.

But Chloe always found a way.

I waved a hand, trying to downplay it.

""Just a little... tight. Maybe I should get my EpiPen from the car.""

His brow furrowed, but his attention was already drifting back to the glowing screen.

""Yeah, in a minute, hon. Chloe's really in a bind. Some deadline got moved up.""

The tightness worsened. My breath hitched.

This wasn't just ""a little tight.""

This was the real thing. Anaphylaxis.

Panic, cold and sharp, pierced through the fog in my head.

""Ethan,"" I gasped, my voice raspy. ""Now. I need it now.""

He looked up, annoyed. ""Ava, can it wait five minutes? Chloe says Mr. Harrison is about to call her, and if she doesn't have the revised proposal...""

""Ethan, I can't breathe,"" I managed, each word a struggle. My hands went to my throat.

His eyes widened slightly, but Chloe's manipulative voice was a constant in his ear, a siren song of ambition.

She'd been at the firm six months, and already she had him convinced she was indispensable, a distant relative of some mythical benefactor who'd supposedly funded his Cornell scholarship.

A benefactor I knew didn't exist in the way he thought.

""Just hold on,"" he said, his voice strained. He was typing furiously. ""Chloe, tell Harrison I'll call him back myself if I have to, just give me a sec.""

A sec I didn't have.

Black spots danced in my vision.

""Hospital,"" I choked out. ""Ethan, please.""

He finally slammed his phone down, a flicker of fear in his eyes.

""Okay, okay. Your EpiPen. Car.""

He fumbled for the keys, his movements j**ky.

As he rushed out, I slumped against the table, the world tilting.

He was gone for what felt like an eternity.

When he returned, face pale, he wasn't holding my EpiPen.

He was holding his phone, Chloe's tearful voice now on speaker.

""...and if I don't get this to the courier in the next twenty minutes, Ethan, Mr. Henderson said it's my job! He'll think I'm incompetent! You know how much this means to me, how much I owe your benefactor's family for even getting me this chance...""

Her voice was a performance of distress, perfectly pitched.

Ethan looked at me, then at the phone, his face a mask of conflict.

""Ava, Chloe's downtown, she says the presentation files are corrupted, and she needs my access codes for the cloud backup. It's the Henderson account, it's huge.""

""Ethan,"" I wheezed, my lips numb. ""I'm... dying.""

It wasn't an exaggeration.

""I know, I know, baby, just... Chloe, I'm sending them now. Stay on the line.""

He prioritized her.

He typed with one hand, the other hovering uselessly near me.

He sent the codes. He talked her through accessing the files.

He told her to stay calm.

While I was suffocating.

The betrayal was a physical blow, harder than the lack of air.

He was choosing his career, manipulated by a junior intern, over my life.

This was the man who swore he loved me, the man I'd hidden my family's wealth from, seeking something genuine.

This was genuine, alright. Genuine, horrifying neglect.

My vision tunneled. The sounds of the restaurant, Chloe's tinny voice, Ethan's reassurances to her – they all faded into a dull roar.

The last thing I saw was Ethan's face, not looking at me, but at his phone, a small, triumphant smile playing on his lips as Chloe confirmed she had the files.

Then, blackness.

I woke up in a sterile hospital room, an oxygen mask on my face.

The doctor said I was lucky. A passing physician at the inn had recognized the signs, administered their own EpiPen, and called 911.

Ethan wasn't there.

He arrived hours later, looking rumpled and stressed.

""Ava, God, I'm so sorry,"" he began, his voice hollow. ""Chloe's crisis... it was more complicated than I thought. By the time I got back to the room, you were already... gone. With the paramedics.""

He didn't mention the EpiPen he never retrieved. He didn't mention his choice.

He just talked about Chloe, about the Henderson account he'd ""saved.""

His success, he called it. Built on my near death.

""The doctor said if that other guest hadn't acted..."" My voice was weak, raw.

""I know, I know. It was a close call,"" he said, running a hand through his hair. ""But everything's okay now, right? Chloe even managed to impress Henderson. This could be big for us, for the firm.""

Us. There was no us.

Not anymore.

The words tasted like ash in my mouth.

""Ethan,"" I said, my voice flat, devoid of the emotion that had been screaming inside me. ""I think... I think your heart has changed.""

He looked confused. ""What are you talking about? I love you. This was just... a crazy situation.""

But it wasn't just the situation. It was him. It was Chloe. It was the foundation of lies our marriage was apparently built on, his lies to himself, Chloe's lies to him.

I turned my head away, looking at the blank hospital wall.

The image of his smile while I was dying was seared into my brain.

When they discharged me, Ethan drove me back to our Chicago apartment.

The home I had once loved, filled with architectural books and blueprints, his dreams and mine.

Now, it felt contaminated.

The air was thick with his betrayal.

I walked into our bedroom, the scent of his cologne, usually a comfort, now making me nauseous.

Chloe's influence was everywhere, subtly. A new, expensive coffee machine she'd ""recommended,"" a framed photo on his desk of him at a site Chloe had ""found"" for a project.

I went to my closet.

My suitcases were still there from a trip I'd taken alone a few months prior, a trip to clear my head after another one of Chloe's ""emergencies"" had ruined our anniversary.

I started packing.

Not just clothes. I packed away the Ava who believed in Ethan Carter.

I took down photos of us, shoving them into a box.

The wedding album, with its promises of forever, felt like a cruel joke. I left it on the bed.

He came in later, Chloe on the phone with him, her laughter echoing from the device.

He was oblivious, still high on his ""career save.""

""Hey, what are you doing?"" he asked, seeing the suitcases. ""Spring cleaning?""

Chloe's voice chirped from the phone. ""Ethan, is Ava there? Tell her I got those fabric swatches she wanted for the guest room! The ones that match that hideous lamp she likes.""

Hideous lamp. It was a gift from my grandmother.

Ethan chuckled. ""Yeah, Chloe, she's here. She's just... tidying up.""

He still didn't get it. He still didn't see the chasm that had opened between us.

He still thought his loyalty to Chloe, to the fabricated debt to her ""benefactor relative,"" was noble.

""I'm leaving, Ethan,"" I said, my voice steady.

He finally looked at me, really looked at me. The smile faded.

""Leaving? What are you talking about? Because of the inn? Ava, I said I was sorry.""

""It's not just the inn, Ethan. It's everything. It's her."" I gestured vaguely towards the phone he still held. ""It's you.""

I zipped the last bag.

It was done.

Chapter 2
I left him standing there, bewildered, Chloe still chattering in his ear.

I didn't look back.

The first few weeks were a blur of finding a temporary place, talking to lawyers, and trying to breathe without feeling that phantom tightness in my ch**t.

He called, of course. At first, angry. Then pleading. Then self-pitying.

He never once, in all those calls, truly acknowledged the depth of his betrayal at the inn.

It was always ""a mistake,"" ""bad judgment,"" ""Chloe was just so convincing.""

He didn't understand that he had shown me exactly who he prioritized.

One evening, weeks later, I had to go back to the apartment to get some important papers I'd forgotten. My lawyer said it was better if I went when Ethan was likely to be at work.

I let myself in with my old key, the silence of the place oppressive.

Then I heard them.

Giggles from the master bedroom. Chloe's high-pitched laugh.

I froze.

My heart, which I thought had hardened into a stone, clenched.

I shouldn't have been surprised.

Slowly, I walked towards the partially open bedroom door.

There they were. Ethan and Chloe. On our bed.

Not just talking. They were k**sing, a deep, lingering k**s. Chloe's hands were in his hair.

A cold, clinical detachment settled over me.

This wasn't even about pain anymore. It was just... confirmation.

Chloe pulled back, laughing. ""Oh, Ethan, you're so bad. What if Ava walked in?""

She said it with a smirk, a glance towards the door as if she knew, or hoped, I was there.

""She's not here,"" Ethan murmured, pulling her back. ""She wouldn't dare come back without calling.""

Oh, wouldn't I?

Chloe then spotted my side of the closet, still half-full of clothes I hadn't taken.

""Ugh, is she ever going to get the rest of her drab things out of here?"" Chloe whined, pulling away from him and walking towards it.

She opened the closet door. ""Can I use this space? My apartment is just bursting.""

Ethan hesitated for a moment, a flicker of something – guilt? – crossing his face.

""I don't know, Chloe... it's still her stuff.""

That tiny hesitation, that was all the loyalty he had left for me. A moment's pause before caving.

Chloe pouted, her lower lip trembling. It was a practiced look, one I was sure she'd used on him many times.

""But Ethan, you said she was being unreasonable. You said she left you. It's not fair I have to live in a shoebox when there's all this empty space. After all I've done for you, for your career... for your benefactor's legacy...""

There it was. The manipulation. The false debt.

Ethan sighed, his resistance crumbling. ""You're right, Chloe. Of course, you're right. I owe everything to your family's generosity. If it weren't for that scholarship, I'd still be... nowhere.""

His voice was filled with that familiar insecurity, the fear of his Rust Belt past.

I stepped back from the door, silent.

I walked into the living room, picked up the financial documents I'd come for from the antique secretary desk – a Thompson family heirloom I'd brought into the marriage.

Ethan and Chloe emerged from the bedroom a few minutes later, Chloe clinging to his arm, looking triumphant.

She saw me and her eyes widened in mock surprise.

""Oh! Ava! I... we didn't hear you come in.""

Ethan looked flustered. ""Ava. What are you doing here?""

""I came for my papers,"" I said, my voice even. I held up the folder. ""And it looks like you're making good use of the space.""

My gaze flickered to Chloe, then back to him.

He actually had the gall to look relieved.

""Oh. Right. Well, take whatever you need,"" he said, as if granting me a favor. He seemed to think my calm meant acceptance.

He was such a fool.

He put an arm around Chloe, pulling her closer, a possessive gesture. ""Chloe was just helping me sort through some things. You know, since you... left everything in a mess.""

I almost laughed.

Chloe snuggled into his side. ""Don't worry about us, Ava.""

I felt a sudden wave of nausea, the physical manifestation of the disgust churning inside me.

It wasn't just emotional. My stomach roiled.

I needed to get out.

""I have what I need,"" I said, turning to leave.

I realized then, with a chilling certainty, that I was utterly alone in this. Relying on Ethan for anything, even basic human decency, was a fool's errand.

As I reached the door, I heard Ethan's voice, softer now, directed at Chloe.

""I never should have married her, Chloe. It was always you. I just didn't see it.""

The words hit me like a physical force, even though I was already walking away.

My hand was on the doorknob. I paused.

It wasn't heartbreak anymore. That had happened at the inn, in the hospital.

This was something colder, deeper. A void.

I felt numb, a strange, cold clarity spreading through me.

I walked out, not looking back.

The next morning, the nausea was worse.

I saw my doctor.

I was pr**nant.

About six weeks. Conceived shortly before that disastrous weekend getaway.

Ethan's baby.

The irony was a bitter pill.

I went to a small cafe near my temporary apartment, trying to process.

And then I saw them. Ethan and Chloe, at a table by the window.

Laughing. Holding hands.

Chloe was feeding Ethan a piece of heart-shaped pastry.

He looked up, saw me standing in the doorway.

A flicker of... something. Annoyance? Guilt? It was gone in an instant.

""Ava,"" he said, a superficial note of concern in his voice. ""Are you okay? You look pale.""

Chloe looked up, her eyes glittering with malice. She deliberately lifted her hand, intertwined with Ethan's, and brought his fingers to her lips, k**sing them slowly. A diamond ring, one I didn't recognize, flashed on her finger. Not an engagement ring, but something significant.

""We were just celebrating,"" Chloe said, her voice sweet as poison. ""Ethan got the Henderson account finalized. It's a huge win."" She squeezed his hand. ""All thanks to his talent, of course.""

Ethan beamed at her, then looked back at me. ""Yeah, it's great news.""

He stood up, pulling Chloe with him. ""Well, we should get going. Lots to do.""

He walked right past me, Chloe on his arm, without another word.

As if I were a stranger.

As if the baby I was carrying, his baby, meant nothing.

Perhaps it didn't.

I sat down at a vacant table, my hands trembling.

He didn't know about the baby. And I wouldn't tell him. Not now. Not ever.

This child would be mine. Mine alone.

A Thompson. Not a Carter.

That evening, I started making calls.

Not to Ethan.

To my sister, Olivia.

And to the best financial investigators money could hire.

It was time to find out exactly who Chloe Sanders was.

And it was time to make sure Ethan Carter understood the true cost of his choices.

He thought he was building a career. He was about to find out it was built on sand.

My sand.

A few days later, Ethan called. I'd unblocked him, curious.

""Ava, that symposium in Chicago is next month. The one where I'm getting that 'Rising Star'award.""

I remembered. I'd been so proud when he was nominated.

""Chloe thinks it would look bad if you weren't there,"" he continued. ""You know, for appearances. People will talk if my wife doesn't show up to support me.""

My wife. The audacity.

""I'm busy, Ethan,"" I said.

""Busy with what? You're not even working. Chloe's working. She's working hard. On my career. Our future.""

The arrogance, the blindness. It was astounding.

I hung up.

Chapter 3
The National Architecture Symposium in Chicago was a grand a**air.

Held in a historic landmark building, ironically one my family's Trust had helped preserve.

Ethan was indeed being honored, a ""Rising Star in Urban Design."" Chloe, naturally, was by his side, practically sewn to his lapel.

She wore a new dress, expensive, and a diamond necklace that looked suspiciously like one that had gone missing from my jewelry box before I left.

I watched them from a distance, a glass of sparkling water in my hand.

Liam Walker, my childhood friend, stood beside me. He'd flown in from the West Coast ""for business,"" but I knew he was there for me.

""You don't have to do this, Ava,"" he said quietly, his eyes full of concern.

""I know,"" I replied. ""But I need to see this through.""

I wasn't there for Ethan. I was there for me. To close a chapter.

And maybe, just maybe, to witness the start of Chloe's unraveling. Olivia's investigators had been busy.

I tried to focus on the architectural displays, the reason I was ostensibly there. My own work as an architectural historian felt a million miles away from this drama, a safe harbor I longed for.

Then Chloe spotted me.

She detached herself from Ethan, who was schmoozing with some city official, and glided over.

""Ava. I'm surprised to see you here,"" she said, her smile not reaching her eyes. ""Shouldn't you be... resting? You look a little peaked.""

Her eyes flicked down to my stomach, still flat, the secret of my pr**nancy hidden.

""I'm fine, Chloe,"" I said, my voice cool. ""Just enjoying the architecture.""

""Of course,"" she purred. ""Though I imagine it's hard to appreciate it when you're not really part of this world anymore. Ethan is the star here.""

She gestured to her necklace. ""He has such exquisite taste, doesn't he? He said this reminded him of my eyes.""

My necklace. The one my grandfather gave me for my 21st birthday. A unique sapphire and diamond piece.

Rage, cold and sharp, shot through me.

""That's a beautiful necklace, Chloe,"" I said, my voice dangerously soft. ""It looks very familiar. In fact, it looks exactly like one that was stolen from my apartment.""

Chloe's smile faltered for a microsecond. ""Stolen? Don't be ridiculous. Ethan bought this for me. He said he wanted to thank me for all my support. For being his muse.""

""His muse?"" I repeated. ""Or his accomplice? Tell me, Chloe, what's your real name? And where are you really from? Because it certainly isn't the distinguished Sanders lineage you've been peddling.""

Her face paled slightly under her perfect makeup.

""I don't know what you're talking about."" She tried to sound haughty, but a tremor of fear laced her voice. ""Ethan knows all about my family. About the benefactor.""

""Does he?"" I pressed. ""Does he know your 'distant relative benefactor'is a complete fabrication? That your real last name is Smith, and you grew up in a trailer park in Gary, Indiana, with a string of petty fraud charges to your name before you even hit twenty?""

Chloe's eyes darted around, checking if anyone was listening.

""You're lying,"" she hissed. ""You're just jealous.""

Then, her expression shifted. Her eyes welled up with tears. She suddenly clutched her arm, a small, sharp cry escaping her lips.

""Ow!"" she exclaimed, loud enough for nearby people to turn. She stumbled back, bumping into a cocktail table.

""What did you do to her?"" Ethan was there instantly, his arm around Chloe, glaring at me.

Chloe sobbed into his shoulder. ""She... she threatened me, Ethan! She said horrible things! And then she... she grabbed my arm, so hard!""

She held up her arm, and I could see faint red marks appearing on her skin. Self-inflicted, no doubt. She was a practiced con artist.

""Ava! What the h*ll is wrong with you?"" Ethan's voice was furious. ""She's done nothing but support me, support us! And you attack her?""

""I didn't touch her, Ethan,"" I said calmly, though my heart was pounding. Liam moved to stand slightly in front of me, a protective stance.

Chloe peeked out from Ethan's shoulder, her face a mask of innocent victimhood. ""She's always been jealous of my connection to you, Ethan. Of my family's legacy.""

""You're an embarrassment, Ava,"" Ethan spat. ""Coming here, making a scene. Can't you see I'm trying to build something? Something you clearly never understood or supported.""

The injustice of it, the sheer blindness, it still had the power to wound, just a little.

But then I remembered the baby. My baby. And my resolve hardened.

""Ethan, look at the necklace she's wearing,"" I said, my voice firm. ""Ask her where she really got it. Check the security footage from our apartment building for the weeks before I left. You'll see her coming and going when you weren't there.""

Chloe gasped. ""Don't listen to her, Ethan! She's trying to ruin everything! There's no footage like that!""

She was quick. But not quick enough.

""Security footage?"" Ethan looked momentarily confused, then waved a dismissive hand. ""This is ridiculous. Ava, I think you should leave."" He started to steer Chloe away.

""I'm not going anywhere, Ethan,"" I said, standing my ground. ""I have every right to be here. I'm a member of the Preservation Society that co-hosted this event.""

He turned back, his face contorted with anger. ""You just can't stand to see me succeed, can you? You always had to be the center of attention with your quiet money and your  'Thompson Heritage.' Chloe is genuine. Chloe is real. She built herself up from nothing!""

The irony was so thick I could taste it.

Suddenly, a commotion near the entrance.

Several of Chloe's new ""friends,"" sycophantic junior architects hoping to ride Ethan's coattails, started towards me, their faces aggressive. Chloe must have given them a signal.

""Maybe you need some help leaving, Ms. Thompson,"" one of them sneered.

Before Liam could react, one of them ""accidentally"" bumped my arm, hard, making me spill my water. Another one shoved me from behind.

""Hey!"" Liam said sharply, stepping forward.

""I'm Ava Thompson!"" I cried out, as they surrounded me, their taunts and shoves escalating. ""I'm a historian with the Trust! Someone call security!""

They just laughed. One of them, a woman with sharp elbows, dug one into my ribs. Pain shot through me. I instinctively protected my stomach.

""Get out of here, gold-digger!"" someone yelled. ""Stop harassing Mr. Carter and his girlfriend!""

Ethan watched, a muscle twitching in his jaw, but he didn't move to stop them. He just watched Chloe cling to him, whispering in his ear.

Finally, as one of the men raised a hand as if to strike me, Ethan stepped forward.

""Alright, that's enough!"" he said, his voice tight. He pulled the man back. But then he turned to me, his face cold. ""See what you cause, Ava? You need to apologize to Chloe. Now.""

Apologize? To her?

I looked at him, at the man I had once loved, the man who was the father of my unborn child.

And all I felt was a profound, weary sadness.

""You promised to protect me, Ethan,"" I said, my voice barely a whisper. ""You promised, on our wedding day. You don't even trust me enough to hear the truth.""

He scoffed. ""Trust? You're the one hiding things, sneaking around. Chloe has been nothing but transparent.""

He gestured to the event security, who were finally approaching. ""Please escort Ms. Thompson out. She's causing a disturbance.""

The crowd murmured, their sympathies clearly with the ""wronged"" Ethan and the ""victimized"" Chloe.

I was bundled out, humiliated, into the cold Chicago night.

Liam was right beside me, his arm a steady presence.

As they pushed me through the doors, I heard Ethan's voice, accepting congratulations, Chloe's triumphant laughter echoing behind him.

Chapter 4
The cold Chicago wind hit me like a slap in the face as the heavy doors of the symposium hall closed behind me.

Liam was furious, already on his phone, presumably to his own security or perhaps even Olivia.

I just stood there, shivering, the ad**naline leaving me shaky and nauseous.

Abandoned. Again.

I remembered Ethan's words from years ago, when we first moved into our Chicago apartment, the one I'd mostly paid for with a quiet withdrawal from my trust, a fact he never questioned, attributing it to a ""lucky investment"" I'd made.

""I'll always protect you, Ava,"" he'd whispered, holding me close on the balcony overlooking the city. ""No matter what.""

Promises. Empty as the wind whistling around the skyscrapers.

The sharp pain in my ribs where that woman had elbowed me flared. I pressed a hand there, wincing.

My baby. Was my baby okay? Panic, fresh and sharp, surged.

""Liam, I need to sit down,"" I said, my voice weak.

He was off the phone in an instant, his arm around me. ""Ava, are you hurt? We need to get you checked out.""

He helped me to a nearby hotel, got me a room, and insisted on calling a doctor he knew in the city.

The doctor, a kind older woman, examined me gently. Thankfully, just bruises. The baby was fine, its tiny heartbeat a strong, reassuring rhythm on the portable ultrasound.

Relief washed over me, so potent it left me weeping.

Liam stayed until I calmed down, then reluctantly left, promising to check in.

I returned to my empty temporary apartment later that night. Ethan hadn't called. Not that I expected him to. He was probably celebrating his ""triumph"" with Chloe.

The next morning, Chloe made sure the world knew.

Her Instagram feed was a curated display of their perfect evening. Photos of her and Ethan, beaming, him looking at her with adoration. A close-up of ""her"" necklace with the caption: ""Feeling so loved and appreciated. Some people just can't stand to see others happy. #Blessed #RisingStar #TrueLove.""

I scrolled through it, a strange numbness settling in. The anger was still there, but it was a cold, banked fire now, fueling resolve, not despair.

Then Ethan called.

""Ava,"" he said, his voice clipped, ""Chloe is very upset. That little stunt you pulled last night? It could have damaged her reputation. My reputation.""

I said nothing.

""She's been getting calls from some of her... family's old friends. They're asking questions because of the scene you made. You need to issue a public apology to her. A retraction of whatever lies you were spreading.""

A public apology. For telling the truth.

""No,"" I said.

""No? Ava, don't be difficult. This is important. Chloe's connection to the benefactor is crucial for my next project. If her family thinks she's being... disrespected...""

""I'm hanging up now, Ethan.""

And I did. I blocked his number again.

He showed up at my temporary apartment that evening, his face a mask of fury.

""How dare you hang up on me?"" he seethed, pushing past me when I opened the door a crack. ""Do you have any idea what you're doing? You're trying to sabotage me, aren't you? Just like you tried to sabotage Chloe!""

I looked at him, truly looked at him. The talented, insecure man I'd married was gone, replaced by this paranoid, cruel stranger.

""I'm not trying to sabotage anyone, Ethan,"" I said, my voice devoid of emotion. ""I'm just trying to live my life. Without you. Without her.""

His eyes narrowed. ""You're surprisingly calm about all this. Too calm.""

Then, his expression shifted. A new, calculating look entered his eyes.

""You know, Ava, maybe this whole architecture thing isn't for you anymore. All this stress... it's not good for you. Maybe you should just... focus on other things. Domestic things.""

He was suggesting I give up my career. My passion. For him. For Chloe's lies.

Just then, his phone rang. Chloe's name flashed on the screen.

He answered it, his voice instantly softening. ""Hey, babe. Yeah, I'm talking to her now... No, she's being unreasonable, as usual... Don't cry, Chloe, please don't cry. I'll handle it.""

He listened for another moment, his face hardening as he looked at me.

""Ava,"" he said, covering the mouthpiece. ""Chloe is distraught. She says if you don't clear her name, she might... do something drastic. She says her family's honor is at stake.""

More manipulation. More emotional blackmail.

""I'm giving you an ultimatum,"" Ethan said, his voice cold. ""You will come to the firm tomorrow. You will apologize to Chloe in front of the staff. You will sign a statement saying you were mistaken, that you were emotional and confused. Or I will make sure your  'Thompson Heritage Preservation Trust' hears about your erratic behavior. I'll make sure they know how unstable you've become.""

He was threatening to use my family against me.

A slow, cold smile touched my lips. He had no idea what he was dealing with.

""Fine, Ethan,"" I said. ""I'll be there. Noon.""

He looked surprised by my quick agreement, then suspicious. But his relief was palpable.

""Good,"" he said. ""Don't be late.""

He left, still murmuring reassurances to Chloe on the phone.

I closed the door behind him.

Then I called my lawyer.

The next day, at noon, I walked into Ethan's firm.

He was waiting, Chloe by his side, looking pale and victimized, though her eyes held a glint of triumph.

The entire staff was assembled in the conference room.

""Ava,"" Ethan said, his voice officious. ""Thank you for coming. Now, if you'll just tell everyone what you told me...""

I held up a hand. ""First, Ethan, there's a document I need you to sign.""

I placed a folder on the table.

""What's this?"" he asked, frowning.

""Just a formality,"" I said smoothly. ""Related to our separation. My lawyers drew it up. Standard procedure.""

He glanced at it, a dense legal document. He was too eager for my public apology to Chloe to care about the details.

""Fine, fine,"" he said impatiently, grabbing a pen and scrawling his signature without reading a word.

It was our divorce agreement. Including a clause where he waived any claim to assets acquired during the marriage, and acknowledged the full extent of the pre-nuptial agreement he'd barely glanced at when we married. An agreement that protected all Thompson assets, including any ""gifts"" or ""support"" that might have indirectly benefited him.

Chloe smirked at me from behind Ethan. ""Get on with it, Ava. We don't have all day.""

I turned to the assembled staff.

""I am here today,"" I began, my voice clear and strong, ""to state for the record that Chloe Sanders...""

Suddenly, the conference room doors burst open.

A frantic-looking man in a builder's uniform stormed in, waving a set of blueprints.

""Carter! Sanders! Which one of you incompetent frauds signed off on these specs for the Miller Tower foundation? The rebar is all wrong! The whole d**n thing is a safety hazard!""

Chloe gasped, her face turning ashen.

The man advanced on her. ""You! You're the one who kept emailing me, pushing for the cheaper materials! Said it was  'value engineering'! It's criminal negligence!""

Chloe shrank back, stammering, ""I... I don't know what you're talking about! Ethan approved everything!""

Ethan looked bewildered. ""The Miller Tower? Chloe, you told me that was on track.""

The builder was yelling now, his face red. ""On track to collapse, maybe! I'm reporting you both to the city, to the licensing board!""

He was shaking with rage. He reached into his tool belt.

And pulled out a heavy wrench.

I know I’m experiencing a miscarriage. I was suppose to be 8 weeks but measuring 6+2 with no heart beat. This was confirmed 1.5 weeks ago. I started bleeding a little last Wednesday and it has been constant up until today. 

I’m at work and had a wave of pressure in my pelvis well my vagina and cramps, and I also felt pressure in my butt like I needed to poop nothing unbearable as I was still serving customers and making coffees but I could feel it. Sorry this is so TMI.

Took about 20 minutes before I was able to go to the toilet. I went to the toilet and the bowl was red with blood and 2 50 cent size clots in the toilet. I was not fishing it out as I am at work and I’d prefer not to see. Before this it was just when I would wipe mostly and some on a pad and the clots were like little coffee grounds.

I am aware that this may not be the end but it is the most I have felt anything all week. I’m not bleeding as much now and the pain has gone away. Does anyone have any other experiences? And I can’t go home as I can’t afford not to work.

1lmclu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1lmclu8/where_she_went_wrong/,Where She Went Wrong,"This story will have two parts Evie’s side and her best friend Lena’s point of view 

“Where She Went Wrong”

The sun spilled through the curtains like it had the day before, soft and golden and cruel. Evie blinked into it, letting the warmth touch her face like a quiet reminder: You’re still here.
She rolled over, phone already in hand. No new texts.
She wasn’t sure when it had started the ache, the silence inside her, the weight pressing against her ribs like someone was sitting on her chest while the world just... went on. But she did know why she stayed.
Lena.
Lena with the wild laugh, who once said, “If you die, I’ll haunt you just to yell at you.” Lena who saw her on the days she didn’t want to be seen. Who once found her on the bathroom floor, barely breathing, and sat beside her for hours, saying nothing just being there.
Evie had written hundreds of notes she never sent. Apologies. Explanations. Confessions. But each time she imagined Lena reading them, she saw her best friend falling apart. Saw her screaming into the wind. Ripping herself to pieces wondering what signs she’d missed. Wondering how she could’ve saved her.
So Evie stayed alive.
For her.
She smiled through dinners. Took the photos. Laughed at things that weren’t funny. She stitched herself together with Lena’s love like it was enough to make her whole. But it wasn’t.
She wanted to be okay. God, she tried.
One night, they lay under the stars on Lena’s roof, a blanket thrown over the shingles, and Lena whispered, “Promise me something?”
Evie turned her head, their fingers brushing. “Anything.”
“If you ever feel like... like you're slipping, tell me. Don't go quiet on me. Don’t go where I can’t follow.”
Evie swallowed the lump in her throat. “I promise.”
But some promises aren’t loud when they break. Some fall like glass silent and glittering in the dark.

It was a cold October morning when Lena found the final note. Short. Almost cruel in its simplicity.
I held on as long as I could. I swear. But please know this was never your fault. You gave me extra years. I just couldn’t find a way to give myself forever.
Please don’t try to figure out where you went wrong.
Lena reread that line a thousand times. Then a thousand more. And still every day after she did exactly what Evie asked her not to.

She searched for the wrong moment. The wrong word. The day she missed it. The day she should’ve hugged her longer. Should’ve said, “I love you” more often. Should’ve fought harder. Should’ve been more.

She became a ghost of herself, chasing shadows of Evie’s smile.
Because staying alive for someone is noble.
But dying despite their love?
That’s the kind of pain that writes itself into your bones and never leaves.
And Lena?She was never the same again.

“The Day I Couldn’t Save Her”

Lena’s Point of View

I still hear her laugh sometimes.

In dreams. In quiet places. In the moments I forget she’s gone.

Evie. My best friend. My other half. The one person who saw all the dark corners of me and never flinched. I loved her like something sacred. Not in a romantic way, though maybe once I thought it could’ve been. No this love was deeper. Fierce. Protective. Like she was the part of me I never got to grow myself.

She told me once, in that quiet, broken voice she used when she was trying not to fall apart, “I’m only still here because of you. You’d lose your mind if I disappeared.”

I laughed. I said something stupid like, “Damn right I would.”
But what I should’ve said was, You’re not allowed to ever think like that again.

I didn’t know how close she was to the edge. She smiled through everything, even on the worst days. She sent me memes. She asked me if I wanted coffee. She told me about some stupid bird that flew into her window. She made me feel better when she was the one carrying the storm.

I saw her pain but I thought I was helping her carry it.

I thought she was safe.

The last time I saw her, she hugged me tighter than usual. Said, “Thank you for everything.”
I didn’t realize that was a goodbye.

I found the note two days later.

I held on as long as I could. I swear. But please know this was never your fault. You gave me extra years. I just couldn’t find a way to give myself forever.
Please don’t try to figure out where you went wrong.
But how could I not?

How could I not wonder if I missed something? If I wasn’t loud enough with my love? If I should’ve gone to her house that night? If I should’ve broken down the door and screamed until she believed she was worth staying?

I have replayed that week, that month, that whole fucking year, over and over. Looking for the crack in the wall I didn’t seal. The day she slipped through my fingers.

She says it wasn’t my fault.

But it feels like it is.

Because if I had meant enough if I had done enough maybe she’d still be here.

I think about her every day. I wear her ring on a chain around my neck. I can’t listen to her favorite songs. I can’t go back to the coffee shop we loved. I talk to her sometimes, out loud. Just in case she’s still listening.

And I ask her the same question every time:

Why didn’t you let me hold you tighter?

This lifestyle news roundup synthesizes information from various sources, offering a glimpse into the trends, health advice, and cultural events impacting individuals on June 28, 2025. From fashion and beauty to health and career advice, the following covers a wide range of topics relevant to modern living.

**Health and Wellness:**

The health sector sees a mix of advancements, warnings, and practical advice. A significant concern highlighted in a recent study is the potential health risks associated with disposable vapes. Researchers from the University of California, Davis, found that certain disposable e-cigarette models release concerning levels of toxic metals, including lead, nickel, and antimony. Alarmingly, some devices emitted more lead during a single day's use than the equivalent of nearly 20 packs of traditional cigarettes. This has led to calls for stricter regulation of the disposable vape market, particularly given its popularity among young adults.

Complementing this cautionary tale, insights from the medical field continue to emerge. A neurologist offers a checklist for safe travel, and new studies are examining the impact of exercise on weight loss. The nuances of high vs. low-calorie burning exercises are discussed, with the recommendation for a balanced and sustainable workout routine. Additionally, the report highlights the potential of consuming coffee without sugar or cream to potentially lower risk of death by 14 percent. Furthermore, a report by the World Health Organisation states that tobacco control efforts are protecting 6.1 billion people.

Beyond physical health, the discussion also addresses mental well-being. It emphasizes lifestyle adjustments during the early years of life, highlighting the importance of overall health correction. The role of a healthy diet is highlighted, including the suggestion that ""shuffling food leads to better blood sugar regulation"" and the potential health benefits of jamun seeds. The content provides insights into various medical conditions, including aneurysms, AVMs, and trigeminal neuralgia, highlighting the importance of consulting a doctor when necessary.

**Career & Technology:**

The ever-evolving landscape of job searching and professional development is highlighted with a focus on leveraging technology. ChatGPT continues to be a powerful tool for professionals and students worldwide, with its capabilities extending beyond text generation. It is now utilized for resume enhancement, creating visually appealing images, and even voice capabilities, with the potential to become an invaluable asset for job seekers. The article suggests numerous ways one can use ChatGPT to enhance careers, offering potential career advancements by utilizing the software.

**Fashion & Beauty:**

Fashion continues to be a focal point, with coverage of celebrity styles, product launches, and the ongoing influence of trends. The best looks of the week feature Simone Ashley and Sonam Kapoor Ahuja, known for their structured and elegant looks. Other celebrities mentioned as influencing style trends include Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Ananya Panday, and Sydney Sweeney.

The beauty sector is bustling with new launches. June sees a rehaul of beauty routines, with a need for new summer perfumes and makeup. A curated selection of the best new beauty products for June offers options for every category. The article also reports on Amal Clooney, who sourced a gown from the 16Arlington Autumn/Winter 2025 collection, which is thriving in London. Other fashion trends for the season include Rihanna’s updo, Dakota Johnson, Rihanna, and Hailey Bieber’s go-to basics, and a range of under-$500 options.

**Cultural & Lifestyle:**

A look into the lifestyle and cultural practices reveals some interesting insights. One of the key findings is the traditional practice of ""cricket teas"" in Yorkshire, England. These teas, hosted by ‘tea ladies’, provide a sense of community through a spread of sandwiches, cakes, scones, and, of course, tea.

In the world of entertainment, the article highlights the trend of hairstyles worn by Rihanna, noting that she combines three trendy summer hair trends into one gorgeous look.

In addition to these articles, the India Today News highlights Lifestyle news in its section.

**Horoscopes:**

For those interested in astrology, the day's horoscopes are also available: Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn, Sagittarius, Scorpio, and Libra all offer insights into the potential for the day.

This has been torturing me for almost 3 years, it just doesn't make sense. 
So I have 2 older sisters. I'm 46 and have a boyfriend, b married and c divorced. 
I am a flirt, I'll admit it. I'm also Mexican and my family is way too conservative and traditional. 
So my boyfriend is a widower. His mom and my mom are best friends and have known each other about 40 years. 
3 years ago he was helping my mom with the remodeling of the house (I live with my parents). I offered him an iced coffee. Our eyes met across the room and I could feel the sparks. About 2 weeks later I had to pick up a couple of bookshelves from a friend's house and he happened to own a truck. So I called him and asked him for a ride. He asked me if we would meet there or if I was riding in the truck with him, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to be with him one on one!
We talked about everything! I had gotten his phone number from my mom and after that day he started calling me and we started going out. He kept calling me and asking me out, always picking me up.
Well, sister b and mom became very upset when they figured out we were dating and claimed I was throwing myself at him. That I was shameless somehow. 
He's a widower. His wife had passed months before we started dating (5, almost 6).
Now, sister b, who has been married 28 years (29 in September), had told my mom my boyfriend had 'looked funny' at her about 10 years ago (when his wife was still alive and had cancer). She claimed that meant he made a pass at her, even though he never said anything inappropriate and stayed with his wife until she passed away from cancer. He's a roofing contractor. He saw her once on top of the roof when he made the alleged pass, then he called to give the quote and never contacted her again. The next time she saw him was when he was dating me.
She claims to dislike him because he is so much older than me (16 years) but I think she may feel I somehow took him from her.

i hate walking past all these things in my apartment i wanna address. i dont like living in the mess and i wish i could clean it but i cant. theres laundry and cleaning up and trash that needs to be taken out and i keep saying ok ill do it today but i dont and i hate that i cant and that i still have to live in the apartment w all these things i dont want here. also adding to this showering bc i know i need to and i also want to i dont like feeling dirty but i cant bring myself to shower either. the most i can do is like use a washcloth with a dab of soap on it to wash my underarms/sweat prone areas but like

i cant even do things i wanna do like ive been saying im gonna redo/paint my nails for weeks now, coloring/other art projects, reading, organizing (its usually fun for me lol), etc. whenever im outside of the apartment, i used to like just walking around stores shopping/thrifting, going to a cute lil coffee shop, going to the beach/pool, etc and lately like none of that interests me. my brain is just like meh lets just go home and lay on the couch 

i barely eat too because nothing sounds appetizing and whenever i do eat anything bc i know i have to, it usually doesnt “hit” like i want it to which just makes me not wanna eat even more lol i feel like this may be a big part of everything and maybe i need to try and find certain foods i can tolerate that also will give me energy? 

i usually always go thru different phases of being more and less motivated to do more things/be productive but it doesnt usually feel this bad or for this long. i ended a previous job that had crazy long hours and started a new one beginning of june i was excited for to have more free time and have plenty of time to balance being productive and relaxing but i literally just spend every minute on the couch (or laying in bed) any advice is welcome!!!

Let’s face it: motherhood is beautiful, but it’s also relentless. From packing lunches and chasing toddlers to managing school schedules, remote work, and mental load, moms are the CEOs of their households—minus the paid vacation and catered lunches.

But while modern motherhood demands near-superhuman effort, moms are still human. And that means mental, physical, and emotional well-being aren’t optional luxuries—they’re essential tools for survival. If you've been running on caffeine, leftovers, and sheer willpower, it might be time to shift gears and refocus on something you probably haven’t prioritized in a while: *you*.

Here are eight powerful wellness tips for moms to help you feel more balanced, energized, and genuinely well—without adding more stress to your plate.

**1. Start With 10 Minutes—Not an Hour**

When you think of “self-care,” what comes to mind? A two-hour bubble bath? A yoga retreat? While those sound lovely, the truth is, most moms don’t have the luxury of long, uninterrupted breaks.

But that doesn’t mean you don’t deserve care.

Start with just 10 minutes a day—before the house wakes up, while the kids nap, or even in your car in the school pick-up line. Use that time to journal, stretch, breathe, or sip tea without distraction. Over time, those small moments add up and signal to your nervous system: *you matter, too*.

**2. Nourish Without Guilt**

Many moms fall into the habit of finishing their kids’ plates or grabbing quick bites while multitasking. But nutrition isn’t just about keeping your body running—it affects mood, sleep, immunity, and long-term health.

Instead of following restrictive diets or trying to “snap back,” focus on nourishment. That means colorful fruits and veggies, healthy fats, water, and regular meals—especially breakfast. And yes, that includes carbs. Your brain needs fuel, mama.

**3. Move in a Way That Feels Good**

Forget punishment workouts or bouncing back post-baby. Movement should be joyful, empowering, and realistic.

Can’t get to the gym? Dance in your kitchen. Go on stroller walks. Do yoga stretches while the kids play on the floor. Short bursts of activity release endorphins, improve sleep, and help regulate stress—even if you only have 15 minutes.

Consistency matters more than intensity. It’s not about the perfect body—it’s about building strength and energy to meet your daily demands.

**4. Create Boundaries Like a Boss**

If your to-do list never ends and “no” isn’t in your vocabulary, burnout is just around the corner.

Setting boundaries isn’t selfish—it’s essential wellness. That might mean carving out solo time after bedtime routines, saying no to one more PTA responsibility, or designating Sundays as “no plans” days.

When you protect your energy, you show your family what self-respect looks like. And believe it or not—they’ll benefit, too.

**5. Ask for (and Accept) Help**

One of the hardest things for many moms to do? Admit they need support. But you don’t win any prizes for doing it all alone.

Let your partner take over dinner or bath time. Trade babysitting with a neighbor. Say yes when a friend offers to drop off groceries. Your village is there—if you allow them in.

Asking for help is not weakness—it’s wisdom. And it sets a powerful example for your kids.

**6. Prioritize Mental Health Without Shame**

Maternal mental health is still too often dismissed or minimized. But postpartum depression, anxiety, and burnout are real—and treatable.

Even if you’re not struggling with a clinical diagnosis, emotional fatigue is common. Talking to a therapist, joining a support group, or even journaling can be powerful tools for clarity and healing.

If your cup is empty, you can’t pour into others. Tending to your emotional well-being isn’t optional—it’s vital.

**7. Redefine “Me Time”**

You don’t need an entire spa day to feel refreshed (although we won’t argue if you get one). “Me time” can be micro-moments: listening to a podcast in the car, reading a chapter of a book before bed, or simply walking alone with your thoughts.

The key is intentionality. Whatever makes you feel *you*—do more of that.

**8. Connect With Other Moms Who** ***Get It***

Motherhood can feel isolating, even in a full house. That’s why community matters so much. Talking with other moms who understand your challenges—whether in person or online—can be healing.

You’re not the only one reheating coffee four times a day. You’re not the only one who cries from exhaustion or feels guilty for craving space. Connection reminds us we’re not alone—and that we don’t have to be.

**A Healthier Mom Is a Happier Home**

The truth is, wellness looks different in every season of motherhood. Sometimes it’s a nap. Sometimes it’s a meal eaten sitting down. Sometimes it’s asking your partner to take over while you walk around the block with a podcast and your sanity.

Whatever wellness means for you, it starts with one simple mindset shift: *You are worth caring for, too.*

1lmcd49,https://www.reddit.com/r/SacramentoFriends/comments/1lmcd49/37m_midtowner_looking_for_new_friends/,37M – Midtowner Looking for New Friends,"Hey r/SacramentoFriends – I’m a 37-year-old straight guy living in Midtown, looking to meet some new people who actually enjoy getting out and doing stuff. Most of my longtime friends have either moved away or turned into couch furniture, and I’d much rather be out exploring the city than watching another episode of something I’ve already seen.

About me:
I work in construction management and grew up here in Sacramento. I’ve also spent time living in New Orleans and Hawaii before making my way back home. Now I’m hoping to rebuild my local social circle with people who are down for a good time, good conversation, and trying new things.

Stuff I’m into:

Working out - but usually prefer solo. I try to be in and out of the gym as quick as I can while still completing my routine.

Live music (bonus points if it's outdoors with a cold drink in hand). Last show I went to was Ajunadeep at the barn.

Bars, breweries, and festivals.

Coffee shops with a chill vibe — I'm there often, usually pretending to be productive.

Hanging out at the river when it’s hot out.

Hiking, travel, and spontaneous weekend adventures — heading to Canada in a week and Iceland in a couple months.

Kayaking (been plenty, always down to go again) and wanting to try stand-up paddleboarding.

Just got into snowboarding this year — didn’t die/break anything, had a blast, want more!

Cars — I own an Evo that I used to race; love talking builds, events, or going for drives.

Stock trading — I dabble, I gamble, I pretend it’s strategy 😅


Politically, I’d say I’m on the right side of left: open-minded and reasonable.

If you're also looking to meet someone to grab a drink with, catch a concert, hit the river or trails, or just chill with some solid conversation, shoot me a DM or drop a comment. Whether it’s one-on-one hangouts or tagging along to something going on, I’m up for it.

I studied Econ for 2 months and first few chapters of Equity until December. Didn’t studied a word till Feb third week then.

The real prep started around Feb 20, 3 months prior to the exam date - May 15. With no Finance background and core engineering background (bachelor’s and Masters), I started studying.

My strategy - Read LES, Solve that topic question instantly, solve practice pack questions of that topic instantly, move to new topic. At later stages I found if topic is too lengthy in LES and too complex, I watched Letmeexplain youtuber videos - I bought the membership. If you have the LES practice pack, you would know that you can solve questions of that topic of qbank and practice pack instantly. I used to make notes while reading - brief notes that helped me memorize because I was simply writing , yet I didn’t read them much later. This went on for easier subjects - Equity (2nd part which was left), Corp Issue, Derivative, Quant, and Alt Investment.

I work full time, so I studied 4 hours in eve - not every day but atleast 3 out 5 weekdays and 10 hours on weekends. This went on for 40 - 50 days. And I completed- Econ, Equity, Quant, Alt Investment, Corp Issuer, Derivatives - 6 smaller subjects.


Started hitting Ethics in April for first two weeks, then FSA which I couldn’t complete but somehow reached till Financial Lease, and completed half of FI, and did first 2 big chapters of portfolio management by 23rd April. 

I thought now its time to just give my First mock - and I scored 69%. Pretty positive - Mock A. I have made posts on Mock journey.

At around April 26- 27, I brought Schweser qbank. I started hitting questions left right and centre and balancing mocks and studying remaining parts of my syllabus half of FI and FSA last few chapters briefly from one of the prep providers notes. 

Some mocks gave me confidence, some didn’t - but I identified a pattern- If I did good revision of subjects one day prior to mock - I would score well in those subjects in mock. 

This made me realized, I have to have my brain stuffed up with info of all 10 subjects before exam. I knew 5 subjects that come in section 2 of exam and made critical choice on what to study in that 30 min gap.

Last 3 days were most critical, I studied and revised subjects of section 2 on 2 days before exam and never touched them until that 30 min gap in exam. I studied for section 1 subjects on day before exam.

Both days I hammered 200 schweser qbank questions and 1 mock a day to have a feel. 

And I did some mistake on the exam day - 15 May. only slept 45 min the night before as I was solving questions and I was the least focus I was ever. But for god’s grace we have enough time, I had a good coffee and went for the exam, section 1 happened and studied concise notes in 30 mins and section 2.

Results came yesterday and scored 1740 - first attempt. More than 70% on each subjects (I think I can say this without violating ethics .. lol) - Pic attached.

Things I learned 
- Starting little early - 4 months is always good.
- Completing Syllabus atleast 20 days prior- meaning marked Les topics read and solved all les + practice pack questions.
- Revision is not simple and reading new topics with revision is hell.
- Exam is structured in a way that you ll not feel confident, trust me its normal.
- Last one week is very important 
- Consistency is key, and even a single day miss wreck havoc - Daily for 4 months is key.
- Solving questions as you read topics is most important
- Mocks give you an idea on how much time you are spending, how do you feel when you attempt all 10 subjects together. Do not base your confidence on mock scores. Syllabus is so vast, there can be a paper in hypothetical world where all the questions are drafted from extreme corners of syllabus that you have shrugged upon saying ah ok, whats next and despite knowing everything you would fail this hypothetical paper. Use mocks to prepare exam style confidence- no overreliance on their results.
- Spending money on things are hard , like add ons - practice pack, membership of youtube channel I mentioned, schweser qbank, but those definitely add value - not endorsing these ones that I mentioned, but make your style and don’t hesitate in spending- focus should be on study.
- This can be optional, I had CFA charterholders (from my org.) as my mentors which kept my morale high and guided me. For example my mentor said to give mock on april 25 something and not delay more. My mentor said to start revising despite I was left to cover critical aspects of FI and FSA.

Sorry for long post, not adding TLDR, use chatgpt if you want. My dms open if you have any questions.

Delivering a luxury sushi order worth ¥99,999 on a stormy day—with an extra ¥100 tip—I was quietly thrilled.

But then I accidentally overheard laughter coming from inside the villa.

“She actually believes you were paralyzed in a car crash, and she delivers takeout every day to support you? She even sold her mother’s keepsake?”

“If she finds out you’re the Silvercrest Society's heir to the Reynolds fortune, worth billions of dollars, and you’re just playing the poor man’s game—wouldn’t she die of heartbreak?”

Jacob Reynolds swirled his wine glass lazily.

“A woman like that—cheap and born to serve others.”

“She used to outshine Sophia in school. Deceiving her now is the punishment she deserves.”

I stood in the rain, tears blended with the downpour.

So he faked being sick for two years—just to help his childhood sweetheart take revenge on me.

His paralyzed legs, his tragic orphan story, his helpless tears—All of it, carefully crafted lies.

In the end, I called the father I hadn’t spoken to in years.

“Dad, I lost. I agree to the engagement.”

After hanging up, Sophia Montgomery’s voice drifted out of the villa again.

“My sweet Jacob spoils and defends me, that’s why he taught that little tramp a lesson. I’m so happy.”

Her slender fingers hooked under Jacob’s chin.

And I saw the ring on her finger—my mother’s.

Jacob chuckled softly, gently biting her fingertip. “You naughty thing.”

I saw his supposedly paralyzed legs, casually crossed on the coffee table—completely functional.

The thick white cast that fooled me for over two years gleamed mockingly under the lights.

Clutching the delivery box, I knocked on the door.

Everyone inside turned their heads to look at me.

The once-lively living room fell deathly silent.

Step by step, I walked toward Jacob.

Each step left a distinct, wet footprint on the floor.

Jacob’s voice turned hoarse and tense, his eyes darting nervously. “Why are you here?”

“I was just... meeting some old classmates...” I ignored him. My eyes were fixed on the ring on Sophia’s finger.

“Give me back the ring.”

The smile on Jacob’s face froze. He hadn’t expected me to be this calm.

He instinctively wheeled toward me, trying to soothe me with that familiar gentle tone: “Emily, listen to me...”

“Listen to what?” I cut him off, my lips curling into a grimace that was uglier than crying.

“Tell me that you generously sold the ring to Miss Montgomery for a good price?”

“Or that your paralyzed legs just happened to be working today?”

Jacob’s face turned pale. He opened his mouth but said nothing.

The room grew heavier with silence.

Only Sophia let out a sneering laugh.

She stood with her hips swaying in her high heels, and came to stand before me, deliberately holding out her hand with the ring.

“This ring is a gift from Jacob. You like it? Want it back?”

She emphasized “a gift” with smug satisfaction in her eyes.

Jacob’s face twisted with guilt. “Sophia, stop! Emily, she—”

“She what?” Sophia cut him off impatiently, giving me a slow once-over—my soaked, cheap delivery uniform.

“You want it? Fine, for Jacob’s sake, I could give it back. But not at the original price. I’ve worn it already, after all. If I’m in a good mood, I’ll sell it to you at a ‘friendship price’— ¥500,000, cash. Pay now, and it’s yours.”

¥500,000?

After falling out with my father, I had nothing left. I’d pawned all my mother’s keepsakes to “treat” Jacob. I couldn’t even scrape together ¥500 now.

I looked at her gloating face, then at Jacob—who avoided my gaze, silently condoning her cruelty.

It felt like an icy hand had clenched my heart, crushing the last flicker of warmth I held for the past.

“Fine.”

“I’ll buy it.”

# Chapter 2

All I wanted was to get back the last thing my mother left me—and then never have anything to do with these people ever again.

“You’ll buy it?”

Sophia laughed as if she’d just heard the joke of the century, covering her mouth in exaggerated amusement.

Then she pointed at the insulated delivery box I was still holding—the ¥99,999 luxury sushi set.

“You couldn’t earn ¥500,000 even if you delivered takeout your whole life. Look at what you’re holding! Have you ever seen sushi this expensive? Have you ever tasted it? Do you even deserve to?”

Before I could react, she suddenly reached out, yanked the box from my hands, and hurled it to the ground.

BANG!

The wooden container slammed into the marble floor with a heavy thud.

The lid popped open, and the meticulously plated, priceless sushi spilled everywhere—sashimi, caviar, and wagyu beef scattered in disarray.

Sophia looked down at the mess and ground her high heel into a slice of precious bluefin tuna.

“See that? A ¥99,999 sushi meal. I throw it out whenever I want. But you—someone born into a life of poverty—you could never live so freely, could you?”

“You’ll never earn enough to eat food this high-end. You're only fit to smell it. That’s the difference between you and me, got it?”

Laughter and jeers erupted from the crowd.

“Yeah, seriously! A delivery girl daring to fight Miss Sophia over something?”

“She looks broke as hell. Wants to pay 500,000? Maybe if she seduces some old man at a retirement home!”

“Honestly, with that innocent look, she’s probably just the type rich old guys go for.”

Sophia basked in their mockery, her smug grin widening.

She looked at the ring on her finger, then back at my soaked, humiliated figure with a look of pure disdain.

“Jacob once told me this ring was supposedly some priceless thing. But judging by how poor you are, it’s probably just a piece of junk, huh?”

“You’re the only one who ever treated it like treasure.”

With that, she pinched the ring between her fingers.

Before anyone—including Jacob—could react, she yanked open the glass doors, raised her arm, and flung the ring outward.

It traced a glittering arc through the rain—And with a splash, it landed perfectly in the rushing waters of the Crystalbrook River beside the villa.

“No!”

My eyes widened in horror—that ring was the last memory of my mother!

My body moved before my mind could react.

Like someone possessed, I bolted toward the terrace and climbed over the railing, ready to leap into the freezing river below.

“Emily!”

Jacob shouted. In a split second, he stood up from his wheelchair!

The movement was fluid and agile—nothing like someone who had been “paralyzed” for two years.

In a flash, he ran forward and wrapped his arms around my waist, dragging me back from the edge.

“Let me go! Jacob! Let go of me!”

I struggled with all my strength, eyes locked on the river as the last glint of the ring was swallowed by the current.

Cold rain mixed with burning tears blurred my vision.

“Are you insane?! You’d risk your life for some damn ring?!”

Jacob’s voice was tinged with panic—but mostly impatience, as if I were the one being unreasonable.

Just a damn ring?

That was the only thing my mother left me.

And his beloved Sophia had just thrown it away like trash.

At that moment, all the rage, sorrow, and humiliation inside me turned into a chilling emptiness.

I stopped struggling.

My body went rigid in his arms, cold and lifeless.

“Let’s break up.”

My voice was calm—unnervingly calm.

# Chapter 3

Jacob’s body stiffened suddenly, then he let out a laugh like he’d just heard something ridiculous.

“Emily, stop it! I know you’re upset about the ring. I’ll have Sophia apologize! We can—”

“I’m not making a scene.”

I cut him off, prying his fingers from my waist one by one, forcefully.

Then I turned to face him—this face that now filled me with nothing but disgust.

“Jacob, haven’t you had enough of this performance of yours? Two years of pretending? I’ve lost my mother’s ring, and with it, every last bit of feeling I had for you. How long did you think you could keep playing me?”

His gaze flickered. That all-too-familiar expression—weak, helpless—reappeared on his face in an instant.

“Emily, what are you talking about? My legs really were injured. It’s just that I’ve made great progress through treatment. And now you’re just going to abandon me? So you have looked down on me all this time, haven’t you? You always wanted to leave me!”

He was doing it again—using his “disability” and fear of abandonment to emotionally manipulate me.

Watching his award-worthy performance, I found it all laughable.

I didn’t respond. I didn’t have the strength to say another word to him.

Silently, I bent down and picked up the delivery box—now filthy and empty—off the floor.

Without so much as a glance at him or the smug crowd on the terrace, I turned and walked away, step by step, into the pouring rain.

Behind me, Sophia’s honeyed voice rang out:

“Oh, come on, Jacob! So what if the truth’s out? You’re not actually upset about hurting that crazy woman, are you?”

“No way. You’re the heir to the Reynolds fortune, and you seriously fell for a takeout girl?”

I didn’t hear Jacob’s response.

It didn’t matter anymore.

Now that we’d broken up, I didn’t need to work deliveries anymore, either.

I called the station manager to resign.

He sounded shocked.

“Emily? What happened? You’ve been doing great—why quit all of a sudden? Don’t you still need money for your boyfriend’s treatment?”

“He’s fine now,” I said, forcing a smile. “Perfectly fine.”

“Oh! That’s great!”

The manager’s voice brimmed with relief. “After all he’s been through, he’s bound to treat you even better now. Things can only go up from here!”

Things can only go up?

I let out a bitter laugh, wordless.

Right—wasn’t it Jacob who got me into this grueling, rain-or-shine, humiliation-filled job in the first place?

He said it was to “share the burden.”

In truth, it was just so I’d suffer for Sophia’s revenge.

Good thing—it’s over now.

After packing all my belongings, I went the next day to the most luxurious hotel in the city.

Dragging my suitcase and bags, I stumbled into the grand lobby, soaked and disheveled.

I looked wildly out of place and instantly drew countless strange, judgmental stares.

“Well, well, who do we have here? Isn’t it our diligent little takeout queen—Emily?”

A shrill, mocking voice rang out behind me, one so familiar it made my stomach turn.

Sophia.

She was here—along with her pack of pampered parasites.

I didn’t stop. I just kept moving, dragging my luggage further inside.

But Sophia wasn’t about to let me go.

She and her entourage swarmed me like spectators at a zoo.

“Look who it is!”

Sophia pinched her nose dramatically, as if I reeked.

“A delivery girl dares to walk into the Grand Horizon Corporation’s hotel? Where’s security? Hey! Security! Has your hotel gone so downhill you let anyone in off the street? So filthy!”",2,1751078708.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

I have not used chatgpt for this post- these are my words (imperfect but mine). I work with so many doctors, MA's and others in the healthcare industry ( I work in a hopsital).

BTW I have not used chatGPT for this post ( but because I have used it alot in the past because Grammer is not my strongsuit- I used the format of chatGPT, so my entire post doesn't feel like a run-on sentence.

1. Working under (most) white women is the worst: I'm sorry but the white female managers that I have worked under are some of the rudest, most aggressive women I have ever met. They always target me and my other colleagues that are also WOC ( especially Black and Desi Indian women). White women will never have your back and always make it seem like you are never doing enough or you are lazy ( even if you are putting in your 100% into your job). My white female co-workers can get away with anything but I and other WOC are always put under a microscope and never given the benefit of the doubt. They will always see you as less than and treat you like second class citizens. I have also worked under non white WOC managers and they are not like this ( obviously there are exceptions cause I also had a horrible Indian female manager but it is usually rare).
2. Working with or under Brown Men ( millennial and gen Z men especially) is also the worst: From my experience it doesn't matter if the brown guys is above you in rank or equal or lower, they have always treated me and my other brown female coworkers really poorly. Most of them will treat me exactly how the white women would treat me, almost like I am a second class citizen. Also I get the feeling that anytime I try to have a friendly conversation with them, they ignore me, give me one word answers and are mean or start thinking I like them or something. Also those same brown men will treat other non brown women the complete opposite, that even if I complain to my managers, they think I am making it up or no one believes me.

I used to work at an Urgent Care as a MA during PT school and the Doctor that I was working with ( he was from India and in his late 40's) and he would literally scream at me and the other brown and black coworkers, while giving me orders vs being so nice to my white female coworkers and buying them lunch and making sure that they ""eat lunch"" or telling them ""make sure your eat"" while not even giving two flips about me or my brown compadres.

Right now I work with brown male doctors and brown male ASA ( Hospital secretaries). The brown doctors at my hospital are nice but I recently found out that most of them are cheating on their wives with some of nurses or even our medical assistants. Most of the wives of these brown male doctors are also brown and are super educated ( most of their wives are highly educated and many are doctors themselves). I often catch myself thinking, do their wives really not know ? Or are they okay with it ? Or just want to stay in the marriage because of culture ?

The other brown males that I work with, always are so obsessed with white women and develop these obsessive crushes on my white coworkers. Like this one guy was so obsessed with my friend ( who is a blonde white girl) and would buy her free coffee and lunch for no reason. She has no interest in him and has rejected him twice but he just doesn't get the message. He also gets super visibly upset whenever she speaks to other males in our workplace ( its so weird).

3) If you stand up for yourself at work, people will see you as reactive or rude vs when non brown women do the same thing they are praised for "" Standing up for themselves"".

4) You think your race doesn't matter when it comes to work and as long as you do your job right, then your race does not matter.

Unfortunately I also used to think this way but I realized how my skin color and they way I look sometimes puts me at a disadvantage compared to others. I spoke about this to my other brown and black female coworkers and they all agreed with me but also admitted that they were scared to feel this way and were living in denial because they did not want to use the ""race card"" as a reason for all their troubles at work.

I went to the ER today about numbness on my right side and headaches. They gave me an anti-migraine shot, ran their tests and said that I'm likely dealing with migraines. They prescribed me Todoral which I have not started yet. I haven't eaten much today because of a low appetite.

1lmbzi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/1lmbzi8/camnabis_and_baptism/,Camnabis and baptism,"Ive been going to the church and followed by sisters for 2 months. It took a while for me to find a church i enjoy going and im trully loving the mormon church

The sisters would tell me about baptism every now and then and eventually i decided to be baptized

I was schedule to be baptized this saturday but an elder thought it would be better to postpone it cause ive been using cannabis

I was thinking of whether i should stop now or not and ended up deciding im not gonna stop it now

First of id never fight the church for such thing. Even if i would ""win"" the battle, id hate to be the guy who divides the community and makes some think ""well well well a revolutionary here"" so if thats the case, i trully loved being with them and would love to stay but that is an impasse

Then again is it revolutionary or anything disrespectful to the church? 

As far as i know it wasn't forbidden during Smiths times and, honestly, cannabis didnt cause 1/100 of the damage things like wheat and sugar caused throughout my life, which are two things that im working to withdraw from. Im around one month without sugar and life surely feels more clear. 

My point here is that i do understand the need to take care of our bodies. The elder who interviewed me is a rare case of a 19 years old man who trully looks as healthy and naturally strong as a 19 years old who wasnt corrupted by poison should look like so his parents definitely did a good job feeding him, much better than my parents no doubt about it so a mormon family surely deserves respect for such wisdom.

Then again i  believe we all see converts that surely should worry more about certain things not mentioned in the Word of Wisdom than cannabis or coffee or tea so i do have such disagreement with the Word of Widsom. I mean, shouldnt it at least be something that the church righteously recommend but leave it to our relation of God?

1lmbzf2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmbzf2,Vokus - Focus & Multitimer i build my own app,"Hi, I'm Andy!

I'm actually a classical guitarist, not a professional developer.

During the pandemic, I started learning Swift because I couldn’t find a timer that really worked for me. I just wanted something simple to help with focused practice or deep work. Most apps felt too bloated, messy, or just didn’t do what I needed.

So I built my own.

TestFlight link: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/g8RZfjVm](https://testflight.apple.com/join/g8RZfjVm)



It combines a clean solo timer for focus sessions with a flexible multitimer that lets you save and load timer lists. Great for structured practice routines, deep work blocks, or more complex workflows.

What Vokus can do:

TestFlight link: 

\-Clean Solo Timer for focused sessions with optional breaks (can be disabled)

\-Flexible Multitimer with support for saving and loading timer lists

\-Run entire timer lists automatically (optional)

\-Auto-delete finished timers (optional)

\-Live Activities & Dynamic Island

\-Dark Mode

\-Session statistics

\-CSV export



I use the app myself every day. Now it’s available as a public beta via TestFlight.

If you feel like giving it a try, I’d really appreciate your feedback, whether it’s about features, design or bugs.

The dentist said I need to focus on resting for the next few days and I kind of have myself set up in my living room to just kind of rot in there for a bit, but I haven't had any caffeine.  
I do have an addiction to caffeine. And not a quirky 'don't talk to me until I've had my coffee' type addiction. I'm talking I'll get migraines and feel nauseous if I don't have it.

My eyes don’t water and the mucus always goes away in like 10-20 minutes. No digestion issues either. Thought I might be allergic to something originally.

Ok not that far back, but several years ago, the bank I worked for decided to try out ""extended hours."" Previously we had been drive up and lobby Monday to Friday 9-5. The new hours were the Monday to Friday 9-5 in the lobby with the drive up opening at 8 and Saturday 9-noon. Since we had to be there a half hour ahead and a half hour after that meant Saturday was a half day and full timers had an hour added to each of their other days to make up for the ""half day off."" 


We had a complete jerk for a manager let's call him (p)Rick. Absolutely no one was going to volunteer for Saturdays, because everyone knew (p)Rick would be be a (p)Rick and split your days off. Being the most recently promoted to supervisor meant I got assigned Saturdays, and no surprise Wednesdays off. 


I love to bake. It's calming, and since we had a full kitchen in that branch I decided I'd come in a bit earlier and throw a few tins of muffins in so they were ready when the tellers showed up. So everyone shows up, we have muffins, it's completely dead because no one thinks the bank is open on Saturday, we close and go home. It went over so well that the next Saturday I did the same thing. In a few weeks I've got some of the senior tellers volunteering to work Saturday if there are going to be muffins. 


Several weeks into this routine I have to take my mandated vacation week. All the other supervisors found reasons they weren't able to cover the Saturday shift, so (p)Rick ended up there. Things would probably have been fine for (p)Rick if he was in touch enough with his staff enough to know that the tellers expected fresh muffins on Saturday. Alas he was (p)Rick so he didn't know. 


If you've ever known anyone who is used to having a fresh muffin with their coffee on a Saturday morning, you can probably guess how they felt about there not being muffins. Since that particular Saturday the entire teller staff was made up of senior tellers, you can guess how willingly they expressed their displeasure to (p)Rick. All. Day. Long.

1lmbwfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditonwiki/comments/1lmbwfz/disaster_or_over_reacting_not_sure_at_this_point/,Disaster or over reacting? Not sure at this point.,"Hello Hello, I’m back again, with a disaster (?) date. Maybe I was being too harsh but either way.

So a few months ago, about April area I think, I went on two dates with this guy. He was really sweet, moved a little bit fast but I had blinders on for sure. We had a lot in common, the first date went well. We got food, talked, went to an arcade and bookstore, he got me a plush keychain I was looking at and some candies. Very nice, very cute.

One thing though, I like to think I can read people pretty well and my instincts were being set off, specifically my gaydar as a pansexual woman. Now I know how bad that sounds but just the energy he was giving off, it was setting off heavy alarms in my brain and gut, which weren’t helped by him showing me his favourite Yaoi manga at the bookstore. 

Sometimes you like what you like, even if you don’t lean that way and that’s fine, just made me side eye a little bit with what my mind was screaming at me but I digress.

Apparently, he had also drank like, A LOT of coffee on his drive into town, so admittedly he was a bit gassy and was hoping I wouldn’t notice. I just thought it was nerves and maybe he didn’t think it through before making the choice to have a bunch of coffee, so I brushed it off despite having a sensitive nose. And I’ll give him credit, I told him my sense of smell is rather strong and he did admit and apologize for needing to go to the bathroom often while we were out and for any smell. He was leaving me alone for 20 minutes at a time, to the point I thought maybe he didn’t like me and had ditched me, but he did come back.

He was sweet so I let it go.

Now, he was moving rather fast. He was using a pet name for me within a day after the date, then trying to have me unload my family trauma on him, along with telling me “I’d love to know every side of you” and making plans for the future.

Fast, but I was lonely honestly and liked feeling pampered for the first time in a year.
We make plans for a week from then to go out again, there’s a Bug Zoo in my city so as we’re both nerds, we plan to go to lunch then the bug zoo.

Day comes, I get dressed. I put in a lot of effort to my hair, my outfit is well thought out. He was dressed really well on the first date, nice black pants and a cardigan. He knows at this point I like wearing nice dresses and dressing up even for casual outings.

He texts me when he’s outside, so I go out and he gets out of the car to give me a hug.

On his shirt, is a Goku Pikachu.

Okay, yeah sure, we’re not going anywhere fancy after all.

The shirt though, was this stretchy, low quality almost spandex feeling fabric, you know that you get from a third party seller online? Think Wish graphic shirt.

But I brush it off, I’m wearing what makes me comfortable, who am I to control what someone else wears? Sure maybe Goku Pikachu isn’t something I would choose my second time meeting someone but I’m glad he’s comfortable enough to wear it second date.

So we’re driving, I’m still getting that weird feeling in my gut that just… something is off.

We go to a Filipino bakery downtown where I have a punch card for, we sit to eat and I recommend a bunch of pastries to him that I love from there. He eats maybe 2 of the stuff we bought, then says he isn’t hungry cause he ate a big breakfast. No problem, he paid for them so he can take them home, I don’t mind at all, I enjoyed what I ate and we talked about life for a bit.

We leave to the bug zoo, and after a few minutes in, he leaves me to go to the bathroom.

Oh no, it’s already beginning to be a repeat of last time.

He’s gone for like 20 minutes, I’m wandering around this two room bug zoo and enjoying the random bug facts I’m getting, waiting for the part about spiders when he comes back and apologized cause he’s once again, drank too much coffee and it upset his stomach. He also went to put more time on the car meter.

Alright sure, it happens, don’t know why you’d do that again knowing it upsets your stomach but we all make mistakes. And sure, don’t want to risk a ticket.

But then, every few minutes as we go through looking at the bugs, he’s making comments about poop. Like, a lot of comments about it. Poop and how much his stomach hurts. He’s pointing out bug poop, if one is in the process of pooping, and making poop jokes.

Why? I’m not sure.

Eventually, we leave when we’ve seen everything together, despite the fact I looked around the place for 20 minutes on my own already, I didn’t mind reading facts again and pointing cool things out to him.

As we’re in the gift shop though, we’re looking at bug shaped pride flags and I see a pansexual one, I get super excited. I’m explaining my mom loves getting Ally pins since both my brother and I are part of the LGBTQIA+, so I always look for pins for all of us when I see them. All he says is, “Oh… alright then.” And seems put off the rest of the time there.

We go on a drive after that to talk some more, we’re going to a popular ice cream place in one of the big parks of the city. While we’re going there he asks if I’ve ever been in a physical fight before, I say no, I’ve gotten mad at my parents or raised my voice at people but never been in a fight like that.

This man, don’t know why he thought this was a good story to tell.

He tells me that the last time he was at the beach we drove by, he was drunk with some friends and they were swimming. At some point, he got itchy down there and started to scratch himself in public. He was apparently scratching himself in such a way, that some stranger thought he was fully masterbaiting at the beach in public, and punched him in the face for doing that infront of his girlfriend and where kids could see him. He kept saying he couldn’t help that he was itchy, and he was drunk so he wasn’t thinking straight and that there wasn’t any kids around, but he thinks the guy was over reacting cause guys can’t help getting itchy there.

Like, dude, this isn’t the kind of story I think you should be telling. Not on a second date, not to someone you’ve known for two weeks, like that’s a story I personally, would take to the grave. But he’s laughing about it, I change the subject and we continue the drive.

At some point we stop at a look out place, looking over the ocean with a nice view. We’re talking about past relationships.

I’ve been in a few, I’m not afraid to admit that and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with it, it’s helped me realize more what I want in relationships and given me lots of growth as well. I’m 24 now, I know what I want in a relationship because of those experiences.

And I don’t judge when he tells me he’s never been in a relationship, he’s 28 and the dating scene isn’t the greatest when you’re stuck on an island. That’s fair. He tells me that another reason is because he was traumatized when he was 14, cause he liked his best friend but she chose to go out with a guy he didn’t like instead of with him and their friends supported her choice so it made him cautious of dating. Alright sure, we all handle things differently, the way he described it bordered on NiceGuy territory in my mind since he kept saying the other guy wasn’t nice like him, but I won’t dismiss his feelings, he can let it out if he needs to.

At that point, I was already on the side of not seeing him in a romantic way, thought maybe we’d be better as friends. We kept talking and he’s telling me that he hasn’t tried socializing or getting out much till this year, so he’s experimenting with things. Life gets in the way so I get it.

His experimenting though, is going to raves and getting high on shrooms or other drugs. Something I’m very much not into, I have friends who do but it’s just not something I want for myself. If someone I know is doing it safely I’ll support them and be there if they need me, I just won’t do it myself and have had people try to pressure me in the past.

I’m just nodding, figuring in my mind that yeah we’re just in different points in our lives, different maturity levels, different points of finding who we are.

We talked about how sometimes the vibes just aren’t there as well, I say I’m totally okay with asking someone to just be friends if there isn’t a romantic connection, he seems upset by that. So then, we’re talking about the dating scene again, and we get to the topic of height on dating apps.

I’m barely over 5’1, I honestly don’t care about height and I know most women really don’t either. He had said on his profile that he was 5’8, definitely more close to 5’4, and I’m honest with him; I tell him I don’t care how tall someone is, I only care if they lie about it.

He starts getting a bit upset with me, saying dating is harder for guys because women care so much about height and a lot won’t date shorter guys. I tell him that I don’t think the issue is height, a lot of women I know and have read opinions from don’t care how short a guy is, the only thing they actually care about is if they lie about it, cause if someone can lie about their height for no reason then what else will they lie about?

He just grumbles out a “yeah okay” then asks if I want to go to the ice cream place. I was craving it, so we go, conversation is a little awkward at that point cause I guess we were both feeling the off vibes. I pay for food for me and a drink for him, and he drives me home.

When I get out of the car, he asks me to fill his water bottle for his drive home then also gives me the Filipino pastries I was excited for him to try. I try to get him to keep them, he says no that’s okay, so I fill his water bottle, he says hi to my cat (who doesn’t like him but she doesn’t like most people) and he leaves.

Never texts me again, I was honestly gonna ask him if he wanted to be friends cause we did have things in common but I guess that saved me the trouble?

I don’t know if it was his kinda put off reaction to me being open about being pansexual and liking women too, if it was my opinion about dating and becoming friends or what I said about height, but oh well.

Least I got to see some cool bugs and have some good Filipino food.

Wanted to share my story because reading these posts helped me so much — and if you’re anxious, I’ve been there. I just went through a medical abortion via Aid Access at about 5–6 weeks and overall, it was a really manageable, even positive experience. Hopefully this helps someone else feel less alone or scared.

⸻

Timeline + Context:
	•	5–6 weeks pregnant
	•	Two previous full-term pregnancies (one C-section)
	•	Got meds from Aid Access - live in TX and there were no issues w delivery. Ordered Friday night and they arrived Tuesday morn.
	•	Took mifepristone on a Wednesday afternoon, misoprostol Thursday night around 7:30pm

⸻

Prep:
	•	Took 800mg ibuprofen an hour before miso
	•	Took Zofran for nausea prevention (super helpful)
	•	Waited until kids were asleep and the house was calm
	•	Had everything ready: maxi pads, heating pad, water, snacks, and a distraction
	•	Took 4 misoprostol buccally (between cheeks and gums) — they didn’t fully dissolve in 30 min, which is normal, so I swallowed the remains

⸻

What Happened:
	•	Cramping was surprisingly mild — never more than a 2/10. Heating pad was a HERO. 
	•	Bleeding started about an hour later, along with small to medium clots (biggest maybe tangerine-sized)
	•	I took a second dose of 2 misoprostol at 11pm — probably didn’t need it, but wanted to be sure everything cleared
	•	About an hour after that, I passed a larger clot and felt a wave of wooziness/dizziness and general discomfort — honestly, I think this was partly due to just being exhausted (I usually go to bed by 9:30 and it was a lot for my body)
	•	That passed fairly quickly, especially after passing more clots. Once the major stuff came out, I felt way better.
	•	Around 4am I had some diarrhea (normal with miso) but otherwise was able to sleep in short amounts

⸻

Next Day:
	•	Bleeding slowed way down to a light flow
	•	Cramps just felt like a period
	•	No more big clots
	•	I felt tired and a bit weak, but also really relieved
	•	My husband made me toast and coffee and I felt like a new person 😂

⸻

Reflections:
	•	I was superrrrrrrr anxious about pain and nausea — but it ended up being a much gentler process than I expected.
	•	Having a plan (ibuprofen, Zofran, snacks, HEATING PAD, comfort setup) made a huge difference
	•	I plan to test in about 4 weeks to confirm everything’s cleared
	•	Emotionally, I feel okay — definitely tired, but mostly grateful and calm

⸻

If you’re scared:
	•	That’s okay. I was too.
	•	But this doesn’t have to be excruciating or traumatic. For me, it was a night of discomfort, and then it was over.
	•	You are not alone, and you are stronger than you think.

Sending love and support to anyone going through it 💛

1lmbtin,https://www.reddit.com/r/victoria3/comments/1lmbtin/victorians_anonymous_va/,Victorians Anonymous (VA),"I have a confession to make. I am addicted to this game. I have downed countless hours into Victoria 3, Europa Universalis 4, Hearts of Iron 4, and Crusader Kings 3 but **THIS RECENT PATCH HAS RUINED ME.** 

1.9 is perfect. It is so good I can't even explain it to anyone else. I read every dev diary the day they came out, salivating at the new content. The date of the update was marked in my calendar and I bought it as soon as it came out on steam. I have clocked close to 80 hours in the past month to Victoria 3 alone. I played hours before so I would be ready for the new features and I played after because it was intoxicating. It is to the point where I dream about seeing the green line go up. I have dreamed about ousting the landowners from power and establishing monopolies. I have dreamed about the most optimal way to export opium to the Qing to rake in hoard of money. I can't focus on anything else. It has started to damage my real world relationships as well. Once a friend asked me to play a game. I said I was busy, went offline, turned on activity privacy, and played Victoria 3....by myself.... Instead of going outside I play Victoria 3. I even set my alarm to wake up at 8 in the morning to wake up and play Victoria 3. I sometimes skip meals to play Victoria 3. 

No one else understands my madness. There is something so utterly satisfying about this game. The early game feeling of building those first few logging camps and iron mines to fuel your construction. The feeling of slowing making coal mines to get steel and improve your production methods. The feeling of establishing your first company and getting that sweet sweet throughput bonus and prestige good. The feeling of getting better education laws and reducing land owner power. No worldly drug could compare. Then you start making more barracks and naval bases, getting ready to assert your power beyond your own borders. You get laissez faire and financial districts propel your nation to new heights. Even the endgame is so captivating. As soon as pumpjacks are researched oil becomes the new gold. It is heavenly. I never get bored. If I am feeling like I'm tired, I scroll on the subreddit and get inspired for a new run.

The other day, my friends staged an intervention to help me with this issue. It has been 24 hours since then. These were the most excruciating 24 hours of my life. I didn't get out of bed till 10 in depression. I woke up and scrolled the subreddit for 20 minutes. I read the hotfix notes for 1.9.5 three times. I listened to the Victoria 3 soundtrack on Spotify while doing work. I sat on my couch for an hour pretending I was exporting my reserve coffee and river plate beef to Europe as Brazil. I sat at my computer for 2 hours watching Victoria 3 playthroughs and reviews. I opened up steam to read the recent reviews for the game as well. I am in gut wrenching pain. My skin itches. My hand is twitching. I don't have anything to do. Nothing gives the same dopamine boost. Nothing. 

I don't think I have a life outside of Victoria 3. It is all consuming. This game has a monopoly on my time. This is both the best and worst use of my money. 10 cents per hour of pure unadulterated gratification. That is the price. Close to 700 hours in this game (rookie numbers I know). But if I keep going at this pace, I might hit 1000 by the end of this year or die from stress. 

This is why I am starting a new support group for people like us. People who might end up homeless if they keep dedicating every waking moment to this game. People who are losing friends and family to this game. People who want to play, just play less than 40 hours a week. Victorians Anonymous is a group where we can recover and play sustainably. (Unless 1.10 is even better, in which case I will throw myself back into this game with no regard to my future.)

1lmbqsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofOtago/comments/1lmbqsg/my_struggle_at_university/,My struggle at University,"I've been browsing some of the old threads that start off with OP talking about how they feel lonely and stuff, and everyone is like ""Don't worry its halls you will be fine"" or ""You're new, don't worry it might take the first year to find a good solid group"". I once believed that I too could be like that and one of them.

But it has now been almost 3 years, I will be turning 21 in a few months and heading into my final semester of my Bachelors' in Science. Not once during any of my labs or lectures have I managed to find anyone. Everyone always just says ""Go to everything at uni!! Meet people there"" but I don't honestly understand any of that (How can you make friends when listening to the lecturer and taking notes?). For my labs, most of it has been individual work. On the rare chance that there is group work, I immediately feel isolated from the rest of the group(s), who already have had previous connections. When I try to extend it briefly outside the work bounds it never ends up working when we are done, it just drops off. 

As for clubs, I've only ever been motivated to join the Computer Science club, but been trying to get into for these 3 years. It never works out though, most of the time I just sit at the back for a while, watching everyone else talk in their small little groups. I feel like it's not fair I have to be there alone, everyone else seems to come with someone else and then they all join up and be social together. Eventually I just get up and leave 10 minutes in. Sometimes I can't even make it into the room, I just look in through the window and that is as close as I can get. I feel like I've always been a bit disappointed by the options available, so many feel cultural based or degree based which IMO makes them very isolating. As a white person born in NZ, I don't think I fit really into any of them. 

SHS hasn't been the best. For 3 years now I have been increasing/changing my medicine, and now I'm hitting the limit of venlafaxine. I'm planning on asking to be referred to a psychiatrist for adjacent/multiple medications at once. Trying to get counselling has been an absolute nightmare; but I have had some experiences with the Polytech's Kowhai center. I feel like it only briefly helps as I can get shit off my chest to another student and just an chance to actually talk IRL, but I don't think there is any long term progress that I can make (nor are they allowed to, they said that they have to take a more passive/listening role). 

The only real socializing I do is at work. It's a weird thing, I'm able to get along and chat with both other university students/people my age and older coworkers. I'm able to be bright and helpful to both staff and customers, and they seem to like me. Why can't I do this at Uni? I wish I could just put that mask on and keep it on the whole time. Sometimes at work I almost feel normal, but then occasionally someone will say something that makes me remember I am not normal; not like you. For example, we were talking about who can take who out on a night for drinking and they asked how many drinks I usually have on a night out. Of course I managed to make it up and make it all smooth, but that stung me pretty hard. I've felt like I have missed out on a huge massive chapter of my life. 

For 3 years now, I have looked on in envy. It fascinates me, how people interact and get along with one another. It all seems to natural and I wish I could be like that. It's all like a puzzle piece, where everyone else fits together and is able to go with the flow. I'm jealous of their smiles, their warm comforting body language and their energy. And yes this of course extends to romantic relationships too, honestly I have no idea why any girl would want to be with me when every other dude seems to be more expressive, handsome, and sociable, with tan, smooth skin, bright eyes, and luscious hair. I don't think I have to explicit state how I don't like the look of myself, but at the end of the day I don't think that looks should be as important in just pure friendship and not romantic. But in first impressions? Maybe. I could go on a rant about being partially blackpilled/pessimistic and believing that I have bad genes, but I'm not. I try to convince myself I don't need you, I don't need friends or a lover, but that's a pathetic attempt to lie to myself. By now, we all know the real effects and damage caused by chronic loneliness.

Sometimes I feel like people don't truly get what it is like to be this lonely. Sometimes I see posts online talking about this but then I go to their profile and see their other posts of them out at a coffee shop or what not. I remember on the rare chance I got a match on a shitty dating app and we started talking that this idea came up and she said that she too felt quite isolated and alone. At another point in time, we were talking about how dating apps are and she revealed the amount of matches she gets, which made me think ""Oh she doesn't get how I feel"". Some of you may feel like you are in the same position as me, but I lack what I like to call the ""basics"": Random/old friends that you send reels/tiktoks to, people that you do streaks/snap replies to, hell even the fact of just having your group members or people in your class following you is a step above what I experience. Sometimes, I will go a full day without even speaking out one word. 

I have to confess, I do follow a few students on Instagram, which was for making a group chat to sort out group projects and stuff. But in the end, that has only increased my pain. I'm extremely self-aware and know all about how social media damages your mental health and how it is not real, but I believe that while that it is true for most people, it is different for me. You see, most of the time it references things such as: shopping at high end shops/cafes, having nice luxuries, taking nice holidays, constantly going out etc. And you, as a normal person with a stable social and love life, begins to believe that they are falling behind and that you should be with them. But the problem is with me the depravity has become so extreme that even normal posts hurt me and make me envious. Small things like getting a coffee and tagging your friend in with it, posting a happy birthday for your other friend, or posting you and your friends going to the gym together astound me and hurt me so much. 

At the end of the day, I feel invisible, slipped through the gaps of student life at university. You may not notice me, but I notice you, all of you, and am jealous of you all and wish I could be you. Not even with how you have friends, but even the small little nods of acknowledgement as you pass someone you vaguely know in your lab, or when you say you should catch up with other people. I feel like you are all in a net that I have fallen down and now sinking to the depths of the ocean. 

As I approach the end of my time at university, only my fears increase. How can I, someone who has struggled this much at uni, go into the real world and try and make friends and be a real person. I recently saw a tiktok talking about this and felt like it really spoke to me here: [https://www.tiktok.com/@blisabutimfamous/video/7518975246653738254?lang=en](https://www.tiktok.com/@blisabutimfamous/video/7518975246653738254?lang=en) . How do it just ""work out"" for other people but I have fallen down so far? Sometimes I reason it by saying that I am broken, a defective piece that cannot be changed. For 3 years, I have been in pain. For 3 years, I have looked on at you, envious and wishing I was you. For 3 years, I have struggled and only gotten worse.

1lmbq3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/1lmbq3o/my_father_the_kevinthe_third_and_final_chapter/,My Father the Kevin--The Third and Final Chapter,"Hello again, Reddit.  This marks the third time that I’ve elected to tell you about the biggest Kevin I know–my father.  

Dad is not your usual Kevin.  My father is what happens when a normal Kevin snorts depleted uranium and then hatefucks a rabid goat.  Kevin has spent the past sixty-nine years of his life believing that he is the smartest man alive and destined for greatness.  Accordingly, he has been continually disappointed.  Kevin spent frivolously, alienated every person who tried to help him, and is now destined for a cheap cremation and a memorial plaque on a wall.

If you’re interested Kevin’s exploits until now, you can check out part 1 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/16byk04/my\_dad\_the\_kevin/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/16byk04/my_dad_the_kevin/) and part 2 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/1d3qsot/my\_dad\_the\_kevin\_part\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesAboutKevin/comments/1d3qsot/my_dad_the_kevin_part_2/)

u/undercookedbrotato is tagged a few times in this thread.  He's my little brother.

Thankfully, Kevin isn’t able to do any more damage, on account that he has Alzheimer’s.  Hospice has told me today that his FAST scores put him at a “7D”--and the scale only runs to 7F.  This means that Kevin has only one more drama trip to pull.  Knowing him, he’s probably going to do it on my birthday.

Anyway, I’m recounting a final batch of stories about my father.  Why?  Part sadness, part relief, and part anger.  Also, therapy’s fucking expensive.  So enjoy!  

* The TV show “Star Trek” aired in 1967, when Kevin was about ten or eleven.  Like many kids of the time, he loved the show, and would often pretend to be Captain Kirk during his bouts of make-believe.  One of the things he liked best about Kirk is that he always flirted with his yeoman, Janice Rand, who was played by Grace Lee Whitney.  Kevin developed an infatuation with the actress.  This puppy love extended into adulthood.  His eyes just about popped out of his head whenever he watched Star Trek reruns.
* In 1992, Kevin took me to the Albuquerque Star Trek convention, where Grace Lee Whitney was the guest celebrity.  We stood in line for an hour to meet her and I got her autograph!  Then Kevin took the autograph, said he would hold onto it for me “for safekeeping,” and proceeded to keep that thing on his chest-of-drawers until it finally went missing.  I still don’t know where that fucking autograph is, and I want it back.
* In my first post about Kevin, I recounted how Kevin once forced open an elevator door because he wanted to see the inside of an elevator shaft.  When talking about this with my mother, she reminded me that Kevin did this at the Albuquerque Marriott–you know, the famous one that’s shaped like a pyramid?  Moreover, the elevator shafts there are GLASS.  So yes, Kevin forced open the doors of elevator so he could see the shaft when the entire fucking thing was already transparent.   
* Kevin made me get an amateur radio license after I turned twelve.  He tried to make me get one when I was ten, but I made a compromise with him: I’d get a license when I turned twelve if he would leave me alone.  Being ten, I then forgot about my deal.  This would come back to haunt me.  
* Do you know that classic episode of “The Simpsons” where Homer decides to buy Marge a present, so he buys her a bowling ball and has his own name engraved on it?  For my twelfth birthday, I got ham radio equipment as my “gift” from Kevin and a ham radio test study guide.  I wanted Micro Machine Star Wars shit.  I instead got a Morse code CD-ROM.
* After I took and passed my ham radio test, Kevin was over the moon.  He took out a big ad in the “classified” section of the newspaper and put my sixth grade school picture in there, along with huge text that read “congratulations to the county’s youngest ham radio operator!”  Dad should have just tattooed “NERD” on my forehead and sent me to school with a wedgie, because you better believe that nerfed a lot of my aspirations of being popular, or even socially functional.
* My Christmas present from Kevin that year was my ham radio call sign as a belt buckle.  He didn’t understand why I didn’t want to wear it to school.
* Kevin decided he was going to sell “internet real estate.”  Kevin didn’t know anything about URLs.  Kevin paid somebody else to make a website for him so he could sell website space to other people.  The other person ghosted Kevin and took his money. 
* Kevin threatened to sue them.  The other party, likely not being in the United States to begin with, did not care.  Kevin sought out the services of an attorney, who promptly told Kevin to get out of his office.
* Kevin decided to redecorate the kitchen.  He got as far as pulling down the wallpaper.  That was all the renovation he ever did.  Mom was furious.
* Kevin’s pastor told him that he wasn’t allowed to talk about Amway at church anymore.  
* Kevin became a Freemason.  They told him he wasn’t allowed to talk about Prepaid Legal at meetings anymore.  
* When Kevin finally got work again when I was in high school, the electric company started doing work down the street for his workplace.  They had to block the road and everything.  Kevin called the electric company, claiming to be a representative from his workplace, and stated that they needed to move their vehicles IMMEDIATELY.  It did not end well for Kevin when the electric company called his boss and told on him.
* After I graduated college, Kevin’s Air Force Reserve unit deployed to Uzbekistan.  Kevin would call us on his unit’s satellite phone to complain about the internet speed.
* Kevin had a thing for big breasted blonde women of Germanic origin.  When he went to the Epcot World Pavilion, he proceeded to go to the Germany section, get drunk by one in the afternoon, and spend an awkward amount of time trying to ask out waitresses at the buffet because he was “being a wingman for u/thewrongbakedpotato.”  I had to shout him down and apologize to the waitress.  I’m pretty sure Mom smacked him, too.  
* Joke’s on Kevin.  Six years later, I got married to a Filipina.
* Kevin and his wife took a European river cruise vacation.  Right before they left Berlin to come home, Kevin stuffed himself silly on baked beans.  He then farted all the way across the Atlantic.  Mom says that the poor Germans on that aircraft hadn’t seen chemical warfare like that since 1918.  She said that it was offensive, loud, boisterous, unruly, and that Kevin was totally unapologetic.  
* Kevin decided he was going to become a cat breeder and breed Himalayan cats.  He got as far as mapping out where he was going to keep the pens, and then showed the idea to my mom.  Kevin apparently decided he was going to keep the pens for long-haired cats in an unconditioned storage shed in Florida.  Mom put her foot down and said that was incredibly stupid and dangerous.  Kevin got his feelings hurt and said that if she felt that way, he just wouldn’t breed cats, then.  Those notional cats dodged a huge bullet. 
* Kevin loves Western movies.  Western movies inspire Kevin.  They inspire him to drink whiskey, most specifically.  Kevin loved to watch “Deadwood” on HBO and drink whiskey.  Ordinarily, this wouldn’t be a horrible thing . . . except that Kevin would put on “Deadwood” before he had to go work the night shift.  Kevin called out of work a lot.
* Kevin used to like to meet up with a buddy after work and have a beer.  This is ordinarily not a bad thing . . . except that Kevin and his friend would pull their trucks over to the side of the highway and drink their beers right in front of all the cars passing by.  Unsurprisingly, Kevin got ticketed for an open container.  He’s lucky the cop didn’t push for a DUI.
* Kevin would get bizarrely religious when he wanted to win an argument.  One day, when I was home on leave from the Army, I took u/undercookedbrotato out the CD store and I bought him some classic heavy metal albums.  Slayer, Metallica, Megadeth, Judas Priest, that sort of thing.  Kevin flipped his lid, screaming that he wasn’t going to allow “Satanic music” in his house–which was totally hypocritical, because Kevin loved to tell us about the time he saw Black Sabbath in concert.  Anyway, we later found the CDs in Kevin’s collection.  Fuck you, Kevin.
* u/undercookedbrotato got a cheap MP3 player for Christmas from Belk’s.  You could add pictures to it, but had to do so through Windows Media Player.  While setting it up for u/undercookedbrotato, I found Kevin’s porn stash . . . on the family computer, of course.  Kevin freaked out and said that the MP3 player must have had a virus.  Why a Chinese factory would send random American families German porn, I dunno, but Kevin was INSISTENT on this.  When I doubted him, Kevin then claimed it was his boss that sent the porn.  
* Kevin’s workplace decided to have an “active shooter” drill.  They contracted with an outside security agency to make the training as realistic as possible.  All employees were told about the drill, and they practiced ahead of time.  Kevin was told that, when the drill was to sound, he was to lock the door to his workroom, shut off the lights, get down on the floor, and remain silent.  Instead, the supposed gunman walked right into Kevin’s workspace (which was unlocked), and found Kevin cruising the internet and drinking coffee while listening to Pink Floyd.
* The trainer pointed a fake firearm at Kevin and announced, “bang.  You’re dead.”  Kevin’s response?  “Uh-uh.  YOU MISSED.”
* The entire affair, including his flippant response, got him in trouble at work.  Again.  However, he did come home and tell the story, which the family DID appreciate.
* Sadly, however, I’ve since learned that Kevin’s entire exchange mirrors a “Calvin and Hobbes” strip almost exactly.  I was a big fan of the strip while I was in middle school and high school, and often had the treasury collection lying around for bathroom reading.  Kevin likely got the idea from there.  Even when Kevin was being creative, he was copying somebody else.  

[https://www.reddit.com/r/calvinandhobbes/comments/15tlsfh/did\_you\_miss\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/calvinandhobbes/comments/15tlsfh/did_you_miss_me/)

* During the conflict with Islamic State, Kevin became convinced that ISIS was trying to kill him (probably because of the Jordan deployment where Al-Qaeda in Iraq blew up the hotel six months after he left).  Whenever he would travel anywhere, he would check the local safety advisories.  He literally thought ISIS had deployed sleeper agents into Florida to whack him.  When we would tell him not to worry because he wasn’t that important, he’d get angry.  We found it easier to just leave him to his delusion because he seemed happier that way.  
* Kevin told his wife that he would move the family to Alaska so they could be closer to me and my kids.  Kevin had just gotten fired from his job for having porn on his computer, but he was able to get a new job lined up.  On the day of the move, Kevin got cold feet and didn’t go to the airport.  Kevin then took the rest of the day off, because he had to cancel the movers and utilities and back out of the pending sale of his house.
* Kevin also got all sorts of phone calls from family members absolutely PISSED at his shenanigans.  At about five in the afternoon, Kevin did the only thing he could think of to make the criticism of him stop: he threatened to kill himself.
* After telling me to “mail him some rope so he could make us happy,” I called Mom and told her to call his bluff and take him to the local ER.  Kevin suddenly wasn’t suicidal anymore when he realized how much the hospital bill would likely be.
* Kevin stopped worrying about ISIS trying to kill him when he got a different job in Alaska (and this time, he actually went.  Mom threatened divorce otherwise).  He then became overly worried about polar bears trying to kill him.
* Kevin lived in Fairbanks.  Save for the taxidermied one at the airport, there are no polar bears in Fairbanks.
* I drew a picture of a polar bear in a turban wielding a sniper rifle and posted it on Kevin’s fridge when he was out.  He didn’t talk to me for three days.  10/10, would do again.
* Kevin is bald.  Kevin decided he wanted to reinvent himself for his move.  Kevin “invested” in a “hair system for men.”  It cost $6000.  Kevin didn’t keep up with his toupees and stopped wearing them after two months.
* Kevin would often get into bizarre fits of one-up-manship with me.  When I bought a car, he’d try to buy a more expensive one.  If I got a degree, he’d register for classes, too.  When I closed on a new house, he’d try to get pre-qualified for a bigger one.  The weirdest flex he tried to pull is when he claimed he outranked me in the military.  He was an Air Force tech sergeant.  I was an Army captain.  He said “time is service is what really decides who outranks who.”  Protip: It is not.
* I was cleaning out my email box when I found an email from Amazon that said, “your purchase of Women’s College Volleyball has been successful.”  Now, I’m not a big volleyball fan, and the only sporting event I watch is the Superbowl, so I started doing some digging.  Turns out that I had forgotten to log out of my Amazon account at my parent’s house, Kevin decided to go looking for eye candy, and apparently decided to see if Amazon offered streaming porn.  When he realized they didn’t, he settled for women’s sports.  Anyway, Kevin lost Amazon and Netflix privileges.
* Kevin was totally tone deaf.  He could not distinguish people’s voices from each other.  He once mistook my wife’s voice for \*his\* wife . . . and my wife has a heavy Filipino accent.  To that end, he called every female singer “Pat Benetar.”  Whenever a song by a woman came on the radio, he’d happily crank up the volume.  “It’s Pat Benetar!  I haven’t heard this one!”  Uh, no, Kevin, that’s Lady Gaga.  
* The night he got caught in his infidelity, Kevin tried to wave it away by saying, “it could be worse!  I could have been looking to have sex with another man!”  I sighed and told him that I’d actually have MORE sympathy for him if that was the case.  He didn’t understand.
* The last time Kevin went to vote, he made it very clear he wanted to vote for Trump.  Instead, he somehow managed to vote for the Party for Socialism and Liberation.
* Now that Kevin is in memory care, we’re just now untangling the mess of financial and legal ruin he left in his wake.  It involves lots and lots of calls to credit unions, lawyers, and the Internal Revenue Service.  Through it all, I’ve encouraged my mother to NOT divorce him–because she’ll be entitled to half of his pension from the government and she will 100% be in a better place financially when he finally croaks.  Sometimes, the greatest thing you can do for your family is to stop being in it.

That all being said, you may think that Kevin was a terrible father and a terrible man.  You’d mostly be right.  But there were some small things about my father that I treasure.  It was in those moments that you’d see a bright star of potential–of things that could have been–had it not been for his narcissism and selfishness.  Like when he spent money that I know he didn’t really have to get me Nintendo 64 for Christmas the year they came out.  Or the fact that he DID wait in line for an hour with me to meet Grace Lee Whiteny (even though he then stole the autograph).  Or when he came over to my house unexpectedly when I had the day off and made enchilada casserole just because he felt like it that day.  Or the day I got my Master’s Degree and he bought me one of those stupidly expensive degree frames that the university bookstore was hocking outside the civic center.  Hell, I honestly think he was more excited than I was.  It did, after all, inspire him to sign up for his own Master’s course load and then drop all the classes.

Kevin, I still go visit you twice a week in memory care even though your brain is now made of strudel.  You can’t walk, can’t talk, and it’s obvious you don’t have a fucking clue who I am.  I bring you cookies and chips and you remember THOSE well enough, because I always feel bad for the nursing home staff who have to sweep up after you after you demolish them like a three-year-old in a candy shop.  You weren’t a good dad, but you were mine.  Despite everything you put me through, there’s a part of me that’s going to miss your antics when you finally pass from this earth.  (Not having my identity or my car stolen, though.  I’m not going to miss that at all.)   

Kevin, here’s a toast containing a bad batch of Christmas toilet pruno.  I gotta say, you sure made an impression.  Mostly a bad one, but hell, at least we got the memori . . .

. . . ah, fuck, Kevin.  You don’t have THOSE anymore, either.  Goddamn it.  Even eulogizing you sucks.

Well . . . see you on the other side, at least.  Save me a seat at whatever passes for the Epcot Germany pavilion of the afterlife.  Cheers. ",30,1751077063.0,StoriesAboutKevin,1,0.92,False
1lmbq17,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lmbq17,30M Philippines - Someone I can share my life and my faith with,"Call me R. I’m a university professor, wedding officiant, political trainer, and — surprise — a preacher. I’ve helped people say “I do,” stood at pulpits with trembling conviction, and taught classrooms filled with restless souls. And yet, here I am, still hoping someone might say “I do” to me.

I’m the kind of man who buys coffee for the girl who cancels last minute, still writes thank-you notes for heartbreaks, and jokes with cab drivers even when my heart is quietly breaking. My life has been many things — structured, chaotic, public, painfully lonely — but never loveless. I’ve loved deeply. I still do. Maybe I always will.

What I’m looking for?
Someone who doesn’t get scared off by the title pastor or the fire that comes with it.
Someone who can laugh at life’s messiness and still believe in good endings.
Someone who’s not just passing through.

I’m not perfect. I get tired. I overshare. I carry people longer than I should.
But if you’re looking for a man who’ll hold your story like scripture, walk beside you when everyone else runs… I might be worth your scroll.

Drop me a hello. Or just whisper a prayer my way.

Area of study/work:
University professor by day, pastor by divine calling, and wedding officiant on weekends. I juggle classrooms, pulpits, and love stories. Political Science is my academic playground; the Gospel is my core.

Hobbies/interests:
Coffee shops, books with bent spines, podcasts, spontaneous road trips, language learning (German and Russian!), and planning a wedding I hope will be mine someday. I love music that tells stories — from Schlager to Christian rock. I write letters. Real ones.

Tell us a bit about your Christian journey:
I was broken, then called, then sent. Serving Christ hasn’t always been easy — the burden of ministry, heartbreak, and loneliness still sting — but the cross remains heavier than all of it, and I carry it with joy. I preach from scars, not just scriptures. I’m committed, not perfect.

Age range:
25–38

Would you be willing to do long distance/relocate?
Yes. If the connection is real, so is the commitment. I’ll pack my suitcase and my sermons.",7,1751077057.0,ChristianDating,0,0.9,False
