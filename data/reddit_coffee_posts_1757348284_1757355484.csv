We met a few times, shared laughs, and just when I felt a genuine connection, she told me she had someone else in her heart already. She said she was getting too close and felt it was better to stop meeting. I respected it some stories just aren’t meant to be.

Then came another… She was single, sweet, and we shared two beautiful months of memories, laughter, and good vibes. Everything felt natural. But suddenly, the past came knocking someone she hadn’t spoken to in over a year, yet still held space in her thoughts. She opened up about it, and I understood.

I’m not broken. I’m not bitter. I know my worth.  
I’m the kind of guy who brings peace, joy and genuine smiles.  
The right girl the lucky one will see that and choose to stay.

1nbv38n,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1nbv38n/looking_for_a_unicorn/,Looking for a unicorn,"Hi all, I'm starting a business this fall - an indoor children's play space that will feature a self serve coffee lounge for the adults accompanying the children. I'm trying to create the ideal play date environment - there's a large open play area with a lot of activities to keep young kids engaged, and I'm modeling the coffee lounge after a wework setup - a help yourself kitchen, and long tables and lounge seating, in view of the play area. There are also enrichment class rooms, and birthday party rooms, and I'm hoping that the place will be as comfortable for adults as it is fun for kids.

So - I'm looking for a fully automatic machine to place into the coffee bar. The caveat is that I would like to pair it with a payment processor and charge a small amount for the drinks so that I can recoup  the spend on coffee and supplies. I'm thinking \~$1.50 for basic coffee and tea, and $2.50 for specialty drinks like cappuccinos and lattes. I'm in a walkable NYC suburb with several coffee shops and these prices would be the lowest in town (there is an entry cost to the space though, of course).  The town is somewhat coffee snobby, so I'm looking for high enough quality that it makes folks happy, and low enough prices that it keeps them coming back.

My ideal machine is:

* bean to cup
* fresh milk tank (not powdered)
* direct connect water
* RFID capable so that I can connect a pay processor API, or comes with it's own payment solution
* Budget: I would prefer to stay under $6k, but would go up to around $12k if it's the perfect machine that has everything I want

Really, I think I can work around any of these points if I find a machine that is excellent on all the others.

I reached out to Nayax (a pay processor company and they suggested that they are compatible with the following:

**- Javabrew:** [https://javabrewcollection.com/home/](https://javabrewcollection.com/home/)

**- Newco Coffee:** [https://www.newcocoffee.com/product/newco-bistro-touch-large-capacity-brewer/](https://www.newcocoffee.com/product/newco-bistro-touch-large-capacity-brewer/)

**- De Jong Duke:** [https://www.dejongduke.com/north-america/en/home](https://www.dejongduke.com/north-america/en/home)

I'm also considering leasing the **Azkoyen S5** (but it's not fresh milk, and I havent tried it out yet so I'm not sure): [https://njosllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AZKOYEN-VITRO-S5-USA.pdf](https://njosllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AZKOYEN-VITRO-S5-USA.pdf)

I tried speaking to Jura about their machines, and their customer service was appallingly bad, plus they have no way to add a pay processor in the US. I'm speaking with [Franke ](https://www.franke.com/us/en/coffee-systems.html)tomorrow.

This is a long way to ask for suggestions and reviews if you've used any of these machines, or if you have any suggestions otherwise! Also feel free to give feedback on my ideal machine preferences - I'm learning and want to do what's right for the business!",1,1757354733.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Hi there! I’m Rick—a friendly, thoughtful guy in my early 50s with a background in theatre and a heart for creating (I work as a roller coaster mechanic and am also passionate about tinkering with 3D printers). I love playing video games and binging true crime documentaries.

I share a cozy 2-bedroom apartment just one mile from the beautiful Huntington Beach shore. You’d be renting a private, unfurnished room (around 10×11 ft) with hardwood floors and a roomy sliding-door closet.

The Living Setup

Shared spaces include the bathroom, enclosed patio right outside the front door, and all apartment common areas.

I live with my cat and bearded dragon, so you should be comfortable with those furry (and scaly!) roommates. If you have ONE cat or a small pet in an enclosure—like a hamster or fish—that’s totally fine, too. Unfortunately, I’m not able to host dogs.

I don’t drink or smoke, but I do occasionally vape 420 indoors—otherwise, feel free to vape inside or outside.

Utilities: We equally split all utilities except electricity, which I will pay the first $100 every month. I'll cover the larger share since I use the garage and other common areas for my 3D printer setup (it's in my room and is whisper-quiet when the door is closed). 

Rent: $1,000/mo for your own comfy space. EDIT: For purposes of clarification, my share of the rent will be $500 a month MORE than what I'm charging my roommate. That's an extra 50% on top of the rent they'll be paying, in case anyone wonders why I'm occupying a little bit more than what would otherwise be half of the apartment.

Deposit: $1,000.

About You

I’d love to find someone in a similar stage of life—maybe early 40s to mid-50s. Solo renters only, please (overnight visitors are welcome!). If you’re friendly, respectful, and value a peaceful environment—not to mention proximity to the beach—this could be a great match. In no way am I stating this preference as a requirement.

Want to know more? Let’s connect! We can chat over coffee, or you can simply stop by and see the space. I’m looking forward to meeting you!

But I watched her die.

Now they’re coming for me.

I might already be gone by the time you read this, but it doesn’t matter, I need to tell you the truth.


Cambria and I met during freshman orientation at Forester University, both pretending not to be scared.

She wore a Misfits shirt four sizes too big and duct tape around her boots — not for style, but to “hold the nightmares in” according to her.

We bonded over cheap coffee, obscure metal bands, and our mutual hatred of small talk.

Most nights we would put on some music and do our best impression of being rockstars or stay up late and watch horror movies together.

She and I would take turns reading Lovecraft and Ligotti stories in a deadpan British accent to see who could make others laugh the hardest before bed. 

Cambria wasn’t just my best friend; she was the only person who ever made me feel like I mattered. So, when she disappeared, I knew something was horribly wrong.


The university claimed she’d gone home for a “family emergency” but the problem with that excuse was that Cambria didn’t have a family. 

She had no parents, no siblings…only me.

I called, I texted, and I even emailed her professors, but nothing ever came of it. 

Her student email? 

Gone. 

The login screen just said: “User not found.”

When I checked her dorm, someone else was living there — a girl who insisted she’d been there the whole semester.

I went to campus police, but they told me that if she went home due to a “family emergency”, there was no point in investigating. 

No one seemed to be that bothered by her disappearance and what was once hot gossip on university campus eventually quieted.

It was like she’d been surgically removed from the world — and my memory was next.


One night, I lay in bed, rereading the last text Cambria ever sent me repeatedly:

“I’m looking into something I found here on campus. I’m going under to fight it. If something happens to me don’t go looking.”

Was this about the sleep study she talked about signing up for on campus? I remembered her telling me about it once.

“I thought maybe they could help me shut the nightmares out for good.” Was her reasoning for participating.

We used to joke about our sleep paralysis demons like they were nothing more than late-night hallucinations.

But now? I’m not so sure.


A few weeks after she vanished, I saw them walk for the first time.

I remember waking up to the sounds of beds creaking — one after another, slowly.

All down the hallway in sync.

Confused, I crept to my door quietly and cracked it open to see students filing out of their rooms — maybe fifteen, maybe twenty — moving in complete silence.

Their eyes were half-lidded; arms limp at their sides. They had that eerie weightlessness you see in the movements of sleepwalkers — like the body’s running on instinct instead of thought.

Their footsteps clacked in a soft, dragging hush across the linoleum as I tried to process what exactly I was witnessing.

Jenny, one of the girls from down the hall, passed my door. 

Her lips moved, barely audible.

“Vel-kirash...”

It sounded like a breathy, nonsensical syllable…not like a word.

I wanted to step out and speak but I stood frozen in the dark, watching them walk in unison down the stairs until they disappeared into the dark…


The next morning, it was just like any other day on campus.

I casually asked around to see if I could get a better understanding of what I saw.

“Did you have any weird dreams last night?”

I received blank stares, a few laughs, and a lot of questionable looks.

No one seemed to remember anything about the events of that night.

Everyone seemed to think I was the crazy one.

However, I did receive a lead from a random person on campus who told me to check out the campus sleep study. It was apparently Forester’s “best-kept secret”.


I searched the university archives and found the sleep study — sort of.

I found it tucked away under an archived projects folder in the psychology department. It was called, “The S.S.M. Protocol — “Sleep State Manipulation.” and it was supposedly terminated two years ago.

There were no names of any participants listed, but the folder was labeled “Group C.” 

I couldn’t shake the thought — C for Cambria?

The only name tied to the project was Dr. Isaac Trenholm, one of Cambria’s professors. 

His faculty page was gone.

The only result I could find was an old PDF titled: “On Induced Conscious Dissonance During REM Cycles.”

It was forty pages of dense medical jargon, but one paragraph stood out:

“In a guided hypnagogic state, the mind can be gently urged with the word “Vel-kirash” (translation: to hollow the vessel so the womb may be filled) to accommodate a second tenant. Dream entities cannot enter the waking world unless the mind is first emptied as it is only dangerous when paired with autonomy. A lucid mind can be a prison — or a doorway. We are simply… opening the door.“

There was that word again.

Vel-kirash. 

What was Dr. Trenholm talking about? What was he hoping to accomplish with this?

I thought about the text messages Cambria sent me and how she could have known something was wrong with the sleep study. 

I think she volunteered to go under — thinking she could resist whatever it was they were doing.

She didn’t just fall into this, she tried to stop it, but it cost her everything.


That night, at 2:33 am, the beds creaked in a dreadful domino-like rhythm as the students got out of bed and began walking.

Instead of watching, I followed closely behind this time.

The procession moved past the quad toward the faculty buildings, their bare feet slapping softly against the pavement. 

My heart pounded as I mimicked their pace behind a tall boy from my statistics class. 

His head lolled slightly as he walked, his jaw slack as he whispered under his breath:

“Vel-kirash…vel-kirash…”

They stopped at a locked maintenance gate on the east side of campus. A student stepped forward and pressed her palm flat against the metal. The lock slid open, the gate opened, and they walked inside.

I froze at the entrance,  the air seeping out was sour and carried a faint chemical sting that burned my nostrils.

One of the students turned her head towards me. Not all the way — just enough that her half-lidded eyes brushed over me. 

For the first time, I thought I saw recognition flicker there. 

“Vel…” she breathed.

My pulse spiked as I stepped back too quickly. I panicked and tripped over my own foot, the sound echoed, causing every head in the group to turn at once.

Their eyes glinted in the dim lamplight; dozens of slack faces locked onto me.

I bolted, my footsteps thudding across the concrete as I ran. 

Behind me, their murmurs swelled into a chorus of chanting. 

It chased me across the quad, growing louder even though I didn’t dare look back.

By the time I reached my dorm, the chanting had stopped — but I didn’t dare close my eyes.

I never took my eyes off the hallway the rest of the night.


I saw them walk three times before I followed. 

I told myself I was gathering information, but really, I was just afraid. 
 
I wasn’t ready to go where she went, not yet.

However, my mind was made up.

The longer I waited, the more I felt her slipping away, like the world was actively forgetting her.

I was terrified that if I waited too long, I wouldn’t even remember who I was trying to save.

That’s what motivated me to practice in my room until I could mimic the limp limbs and shallow breathing of the unconscious mind.

I practiced in the mirror, swaying with my eyes cracked just enough to see — until I couldn’t tell where pretending ended and becoming something hollow began.


At exactly 2:33 a.m., when they rose from their beds to sleepwalk, I slipped into the already full hallway and joined them.

No one looked at me.

We moved together, barefoot — a slow procession of blank faces through the dark.

Outside the campus, the air was dense like underwater pressure.

The lamplight didn’t stretch as far as it should’ve across the quad as we passed the fountain toward the old biology lab.

Its windows were boarded, and chains were wrapped around the doors where a “DO NOT ENTER” sign hung crooked, the red ink sun-bleached into pink.

One of the students in the front of the pack reached out and touched the chain.

There was no rattling, no snapping, it simply fell apart, causing the doors to swing open on their own.

Inside, we passed through narrow, decaying corridor as the doors shut behind us.

Fluorescent lights hummed and flickered overhead. One buzzed so violently it blew out — and stayed dark for a full minute.

In that darkness, I felt the breath of one the students upon my neck.

When the light returned, the hallway was unchanged, but I couldn’t stop shaking.

Symbols covered the walls — spirals, slashes, intersecting circles. 
 
One had been scratched out violently, gouged deep into the plaster.

Then came the stairs.

A narrow, concrete stairwell slick with condensation and no railings led us down.

Every step echoed like we were walking inside a throat

A flickering light above us died again, and in that moment of darkness, I heard a voice echo faintly from inside the pipes:

“Vel-kirash...”

The syllables bounced off the walls strangely. It was as if they were being spoken in reverse.

When the light came back, everyone kept walking.

No one reacted.

The walls shifted gradually from cinderblock to smooth, cold stone as we traversed across the uneven floors.

And then...we reached the lab.

Or maybe it was never just a lab.

At the center of the room was Cambria, her breath ragged. In front of her stood Dr. Isaac Trenholm, chanting in a language that felt older than words.

She wasn’t strapped down; she chose to be there.

Maybe she thought if she gave herself willingly, she could stop it from taking someone else.

But she wasn’t winning.

Whatever she’d hoped to fight… was winning.

The others stood with eyes closed, chanting — not watching but feeding it. 
 
Each word tightened the noose around her heart.

The carved symbols on the walls pulsed faintly, glowing a sickly green in time with the chants.

The thing inside Cambria was not merely emerging — it was consuming her from within.

Her lungs convulsed. 

Something slithered beneath the skin of her ribcage, coiling and uncoiled like a worm as it pressed against her heart.

Spider silk like tendrils entwined with her blood vessels, siphoning the life from her body as she twitched involuntarily.

I watched through squinted eyes as her muscles spasmed in a desperate attempt to let out a scream that she couldn’t. 

She silently mouthed a desperate “help me” from her cracked lips.

I wanted to cry out her name and tell her I was there but instead, I watched in horror.

Her eyelids fluttered in anguish as something tore free.

Dr. Trenholm staggered forward as the cracking of Cambria’s skull filled the chamber, his face shining with sweat. 

His lips trembled with joy as if he were watching a miracle being performed. 

His hands shook not with fear but anticipation as the creature, slick with afterbirth, tore itself free.

Trenholm exhaled a sigh of relief as it emerged from her skull, its skin thin, translucent, and showing twitching veins.

Tears dripped from the corners of her eyes and down her cheeks as its limbs moved in all the wrong ways, jerking violently.

Her fingers twitched and curled into a fist, then opened like a flower wilting in fast-forward.

For a second, her eyes cleared — no longer glassy but wet with terror. 

She looked at me, mouthed my name — and for a moment, she was there. 

Then she was gone.

The creature’s mouth twisted into a terrible imitation of a smile, but it wasn’t a face built for warmth.

And then, a barely audible whisper:

“Don’t wake up...”

The words pierced me, a desperate plea, and a warning all at once.

The creature’s head snapped toward me with impossible speed.

Its vacant, half-formed eyes locked onto mine, and I felt a cold click inside my chest.

I couldn’t stop the scream.

“Get her!” Dr. Trenholm commanded, pointing at me.

I didn’t think, I just ran as fast as I could.

I sprinted through the dark, lungs burning, the air thick with blood and chemicals.  

Claws scraped against concrete behind me, gouging deep into the walls.  

Emergency lights flickered, casting warped shadows as I ran.

My chest tightened as the sound of footsteps dragging softly but deliberately just out of sight grew louder behind me.

All the students from earlier…they were hunting me as well.

I could hear the creature’s movements close behind. 

I turned to see its limbs dragging and then snapping forward unnaturally fast like watching stop-motion in real time.

It let out a wet, gurgling rattle as it pounced, its ice-cold claws grazed my shoulder.

I twisted away, my shirt ripping as I felt warm blood drip down my back.

The students were practically breathing down my neck but the adrenaline coursing through me wouldn’t let me stop.

A door ahead shimmered faintly and desperation made me sprint for it with everything I had. 

I slammed into it with all my weight and finally burst out into the cold night air. 

I kept running beneath flickering streetlamps that buzzed and sputtered like they were dying. 

Every step I took felt heavier, the world around me tilting just slightly off balance.

My heart hammered like a frantic drum as I collapsed onto the cracked sidewalk, gasping for air as I dared to look back. 

The building loomed behind me, its boarded windows like dead eyes.

Somewhere inside, the creature still waited.

I know the truth.

I know what I saw.

I never went back, and I’ve been running ever since.

I found her…and I failed her.

I wonder if she was still in there.

If her last feeling was pain… or if she was already gone — carved out, emptied like a house no one remembers living in.


I’m at a bus station, three states away.

I swear I hear the faint shuffle of bare feet against tile.

My friends say they don’t remember me. 

Not just Cambria — me. 

One of them even asked who I was before hanging up.

Last night, at the motel I stayed at, I thought I saw someone standing across the street watching me.

I shut the blinds, locked the door, wedged a chair under the knob…and still, I heard it. 

At 2:33 a.m., a harsh whisper through the vent: ‘Vel-kirash.’

I don’t know how much longer I can run before they take me back underground, before I forget why I was running at all.

If you’ve ever dreamed of stairs that only go down — don’t follow.

Please. 

For me. 

For Cambria.

But the problem is I’m on 4 psych meds that do not typically mix well with caffeine. Some are anti depressants. It can really make me feel on top of the world in mix with these meds. I recognize it’s time I quit caffeine. All my self help books tell me the bipolar brains probably shouldn’t usually can’t handle loads of caffeine, etc. I wake up anxious I won’t have time to drink my coffee before work. And get anxious about the idea of cutting it out completely. I want to wean off of it not just cut cold turkey. Is there any advice yall have? Any books you’d recommend?

1nbuwko,https://www.reddit.com/r/dancemoms/comments/1nbuwko/psa_to_all_melissa_sympathizers_melissa_is_not/,PSA to all Melissa sympathizers: Melissa is not innocent,"I’m rewatching the show with the knowledge that I have from behind the scenes, and I don’t understand how Melissa has sympathizers. I see people defend her saying that the moms were jealous of Maddie, and that she was just doing what was best for her kids. When in fact the opposite is true for both statements. Melissa compromised her kids friendships, their childhoods, and their safety for fame. It’s common knowledge that she took her kids out of school so they could perfect and learn their dances before everyone else. She proved time and time again that she will be sneaky to get her kids ahead, by getting people gifts and going out for coffee. She went as far to talk poorly about Chloe to Abby’s face and she snitched on her knowing Abby would torture her. And apparently, she tried to sabotage Chloe at a competition and get her disqualified when her music skipped. And the biggest issue is that she’d lie about all of it. The moms would get so mad because she’d act like she was innocent, she’d act like an ally when she knew deep down that she’d betray all of them for a crown. She knew that she was taking her kids to dance early before anyone else, but she would lie and let Abby call her kids teammates stupid. She knew that Maddie was so perfect because she had extra time and she helped push the narrative that Maddie was better than all of them. And yes Maddie was an amazing dancer, but who wouldn’t be with all of the attention and time that she was given? If she was as amazing as they said then they would have made it an even playing field. And Melissa 100 percent was involved with Abby’s money scandal, that’s why she cut ties with her and let her take the fall while getting immunity in court. But like it’s so obvious that she played Abby, she used her to get her kids ahead and dropped her when she no longer needed her. Like Melissa admitted in a YouTube video that Abby made the eye comment towards Chloe, but she stood 10 toes down with Abby during the aftermath of Christi leaving knowing what was said. But now she wants to admit that Abby did all of these horrible things? And she put Maddie in some of the most dangerous situations with adults, she sees these adults become infatuated with her child and does nothing. Sia and Abby were both creepy with Maddie but Melissa boasts that she shared her children with people. She didn’t protect her. And she let Kenzie be ignored and compared to Maddie constantly. All of the moms and some of the girls have done awful things, and being on the show is one of them. But I see Christi, Kendall and Kalani get critisism the most. But Melissa by far has the most skeletons. And the only reason she’s calmed down from her ways is because she doesn’t need to get ahead anymore. ",7,1757354349.0,dancemoms,0,0.89,False

Heating time, tested 25 times ranges from 3 minutes 50 seconds to 4 minutes 5 seconds, using a temperature gauge, it always reaches 100 degrees but you have to place the temp gauge quickly as this ones heat doesnt last long. We had 3 of these, 1 is non functioning after few months. so quality control is questionable but this is cheap. using the meralco calculator, this goes at 1 pesos and 50 cents per use. when getting the item to us via shopee, took only a few days and was well packed. few problems, after 30 seconds temp depreciates due to plastic interior. unlike the ones with metallic or glass, this one goes down badly like 10 degrees fast. its quiet though. all wattages play with the 1400 to 1450 specially in the highest heat and max liter, you can feel the heat while touching the exterior, plastic really thin. touching the handle is hot when going up. would i recommend this, its cheap but i question if it would last long. heating element is apparent, actually if you look closer everything is apparent.

[Dowell](https://s.shopee.ph/7ATrzAzl66): Mettalic inside plastic outer body, takes 5 minutes 15 seconds to heat up at full, some tries got it down to 5 minutes.every heat up reachesboiling point, see picture of the temp gauge, most of them actually reaches that, we have a few of these, they do last. but take note it goes down fast as well specially for the [Kyowa](https://s.shopee.ph/2qKsmvbJml). 1800 watts plus or minus in the wattage tester, its 1.7 litters, it can rotate in the base and has auto shut off that goes to a t, cant see the heating element unlike the super cheaper ones, does shake if you put it in 1.7l max. takes long to heat up, check time it was 5 minutes 15 seconds, we tested few more times and it plays in that area. using meralco meter this goes to 2 pesos and 18 cents. plays at 1800 to 1870 watts at max liter. another con is that when pouring at a certain angle the water goes other places so got to pour it not purely vertical

[Camel](https://s.shopee.ph/9UrmihG5BW): complete heat at full is 4 minutes, not bad due to capacity. tried it 20 times it plays in that time, always plays at that time, plastic exterior but the interior is stainless, when sent to us it was well packed. automatic shut off is regular and functions like clockwork, very sturdy truth be told, this one first time use, no plastic taste, due to metallic interior, 1500 watts matches with electronic tester. per 4 minutes, my estimate using meralco calculator at 1.5 pesos per heat up. if you want sturdiness this is the one, below 900, it will last, we had 2 of these both still working. plays 1500 watts above a bit. seems a better option than others. at max liter. heat for this and the [Dowell ](https://s.shopee.ph/7ATrzAzl66)do go down but not as fast as its double plastic and steel

  
[Deerma ](https://s.shopee.ph/5L2EIpQdig)kettle: do not purchase, doesnt work after awhile, looks good though, great gimick as well. but my finding might be that the one i purchased might be a lemon, but doesnt work. all plastic

[breville kettle](https://s.shopee.ph/9zo3rVOBdI): well made wattage plays at 2200 watts below, quiet, metalic exterior but the clear places are plastic, no splash, handle isnt hot but really really expensive, reaches boiling point sometimes shakes. well made as the cats have made this thing fall down a few times.

[Micromatic](https://s.shopee.ph/40WqhPtx6f): for the below 500, this thing is a beauty, had 3, still functioning, metallic exterior, does get water marks when used, didnt expect something this cheap to be quality in stainless, better than the [Kyowa](https://s.shopee.ph/2qKsmvbJml), temp does reach on time, plays around at 1210 watts, and heats up a bit slow at 5 minutes 15 seconds to 6 minutes lets, mostly at 5 minute above mark, so using meralco calculator it is costing at 1.64 cents per use. so far its ok, we have this in a few properties of the boss. does the job.

[Brewista](https://s.shopee.ph/6VEBgLSjxI): dang this thing is expensive but fast, super quiet wattage plays at 1162 to 1200, 3 minutes 10 seconds average, lowest speed was 3 minutes 7 seconds that means its 84 cents per use, great if you like having green tea, expensive though. would i recommend this yes if you like having certain coffees and certain teas. well made. 0.6 only.

[bonavita](https://s.lazada.com.ph/s.uYQuJ?cc): another expensive, more mech than digital, slower than brewista, takes 5 minutes, the settings must be palced on boiling setting not on the temp gaugage unlike brewista, all metallic but its larger at 1.2l, wattage is quite high at 2200 playing on that, using meralco meter that reaches 3 pesos mas o minus, well built. handle doesnt get hot

[Sapoe](https://s.shopee.ph/VtzZAX2Ke): Wattage a bit high, tested it more and dang it reaches 2400 watts. may look expensive but uses mostly plastic, it isnt clear glass but clear plastic, does the job well, need to press button in middle to open as opposed to side. side is for heating up, gf got confused there. actually good item as far as durability is. but few other problems, using the calculator this thing might not be worth to purchase even durability is excellent. took 6 minutes 30 seconds, average actually reaches 6 minutes then you factor in 2400 watts, would not recommend this.

[Russell Hobbes](https://s.shopee.ph/4L6i7vQ7vt): got to say excellent here, quite sturdy, gets up in temp properly, not noisy, glass is quite sturdy can handle changes in temp without cracking. ive done a lot with this model, making gulab tea, heck i even cooked tea with the device itself. the temp is very good in getting there. now few problems wattage a bit high 2200 to 2300 but it took only 4 minutes average so 2 pesos 60 cents using it, not bad actually not like [Sapoe](https://s.shopee.ph/VtzZAX2Ke), my God 6 minutes, i never knew it took long with that till i did this experiment.

[Xiaomi Mijia Electric Kettle](https://s.shopee.ph/50PO7VKZAP), good kettle, not that expensive, 6 minute 45 to 7 after numerous tries, its double walled it isnt bad to say, the handle doesnt get hot when being used unlike some cheaper models or expensive ones in the list. durable, good use, gf likes it due to sleek look. using meralco appliance calculator per use it would be 2.8 pesos. not that bad. not great. affiliate link posted take note this is at full.

1nbus31,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1nbus31/does_the_icepure_rwf0500a_refrigerator_water/,Does the ICEPURE RWF0500A Refrigerator Water Filter Deliver Pure Water Review?,"**Everyday Use with the ICEPURE RWF0500A Refrigerator Water Filter**

The ICEPURE RWF0500A Refrigerator Water Filter has been quite the addition to my household. As someone who drinks a lot of water straight from the fridge, I depend on clean, refreshing water daily, and this filter aims to deliver just that. Replacing my usual filter with this alternative by ICEPURE, I tested it thoroughly over a period of several weeks to see how it performs in actual daily use. Let me walk you through the highs and lows.

**Efficient Filtration Equals Cleaner Water**

What initially sold me on trying this refrigerator filter was its promise of efficient filtration capacity. The filter claims to remove 99% of chlorine, particles, unpleasant odors, and other harmful substances, which seemed like a tall order at first. To give it a real test, I used water from it for both drinking and cooking. Within a day or two, I noticed a distinct improvement in the taste of water. The unpleasant chlorine smell was gone, and the water tasted crisp and refreshing. Personally, I found this great for brewing coffee—no odd aftertaste at all. 

With its 0.5-micron filtration precision and coconut shell carbon material, this filter retains beneficial minerals while stripping away the bad stuff. Knowing it complies with NSF/ANSI certifications, I felt reassured about its safety and reliability.

**Straightforward Installation—A DIYer’s Dream**

I’m no pro when it comes to installing appliances, but replacing my old filter with this one took all of five minutes. No tools were necessary, and it fit right into the fridge without any leaks, which has been an issue with previous filters I’ve used. The installation process is so precise and easy that my teenager could probably do it. ICEPURE really thought ahead here, and for those who dread filter replacements, putting this one in couldn’t be simpler.

[Grab ICEPURE RWF0500A at the best price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0169t71uw/)

**Dependable Filtration Lifespan**

A notable feature of this product is its advertised filtering lifespan—around six months or 300 gallons, depending on water quality. I've been running mine for a month and a half now, and I’m still getting crystal-clear water with every use. That said, heavy water users (like large families) might experience slightly shorter filter life. Regardless, having a heads-up from the manufacturer about the approximate longevity is quite helpful for planning replacements. 

**Good Aspects**

- Removes chlorine and improves water taste significantly.
- Installation is quick and requires no tools.
- High-quality materials: BPA-free and food-grade carbon filtration.
- Certified reliability via NSF/ANSI and other major standards.
- Fits a wide variety of refrigerators from brands like Whirlpool, Kenmore, and Maytag.

**Bad Points**

- While it fits most fridge models, always double-check compatibility.
- Larger households might find the six-month lifespan slightly limiting.
- The packaging doesn’t include clear recycling options for disposed filters.

**High-Performance Comparison with Product Rivals**

On comparing this filter with other options like the EveryDrop Filter 5 and Whirlpool 4396508 original replacements, I’ve found a few notable differences. While the EveryDrop filter feels slightly sturdier in hand, the taste quality delivered by the ICEPURE isn’t far off, and its price certainly undercuts the competition. Whirlpool’s OEM filter might last a smidge longer, but once again, affordability shifts the balance back in favor of this ICEPURE replacement. For budget-conscious individuals, I feel this filter packs a solid punch despite the minor differences.

If you’re weighing options in terms of safety and taste, ICEPURE competes admirably with heavyweights in the field. But if a longer lifespan is your priority, spending more on OEM options might be worth considering.

**Value for Money**

Affordability is undeniably one of this filter’s strong suits. With prices for refrigerator water filters fluctuating constantly, ICEPURE manages to fall into the ""budget-friendly"" range while still delivering respectable quality. The filter feels like a smart investment for households like mine that want clean, tasty water without breaking the bank on big-name brands.

1nburxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeStressTest/comments/1nburxn/why_is_the_alera_folding_table_a_top_pick_for/,Why is the Alera Folding Table a Top Pick for Small Spaces?,"Testing out the Alera ALEPT36SW folding table in my daily routine has been quite an eye-opening experience. From hosting casual get-togethers with friends to ensuring I have a sturdy workspace for my occasional DIY projects, this square folding table has consistently proven its worth. The design caught my attention right away. The square shape and crisp white top give off a minimalist, modern vibe that easily blends into various settings—be it a cozy dining area or an impromptu outdoor patio arrangement. It’s compact yet functional, offering just the right amount of surface space without overwhelming a room.  

**Strengths**

- The water- and stain-resistant blow-molded polyethylene top truly stands out. Spills during brainstorming sessions over coffee or accidental sauce messes at a barbecue wiped off effortlessly.
- I instantly appreciated its sturdy build quality. The powder-coated metal frame didn’t falter even when we decided to test its 600-lb weight claim using some heavy gardening supplies stacked evenly.
- The folding mechanism is straightforward, and I can have it set up or stowed away in seconds without needing an assembly guide.
- Portability is another plus. Despite weighing about 27 pounds, it’s slim and compact enough to transport or slide easily into a small storage space.
  
[Check Alera ALEPT36SW price on Amazon.](https://verycosy.com/p/b07n7txn9v/)

**Slide Lock Innovation**  
Having used my fair share of folding furniture, I find the inclusion of a slide lock mechanism a thoughtful addition. Often, folding tables can feel rickety when fully extended, but the lock reinforces stability brilliantly. Even when nudged or bumped accidentally, the table didn’t wobble. This reliability made it a hit at a birthday gathering where kids excitedly leaned over to blow out candles.

**Durability You Can Depend On**  
With its dent- and scratch-resistant construction, the table handled a variety of uses remarkably well. From an arts-and-crafts afternoon to hosting a few rambunctious rounds of tabletop games, the surface held up without acquiring dents or unsightly marks. The non-marring foot caps are a lifesaver for preventing unsightly scuffs or scratches on my hardwood floors.

**Convenience Meets Practicality**  
Its ability to fold the legs flush into the tabletop seems like such a simple feature, but it transforms how easy it is to store. When collapsed, it creates a flat surface that slides neatly under a bed or alongside other furniture pieces in the garage. This makes it an ideal piece for compact apartments or for anyone constantly rearranging their space, like myself.

**Target Audience**  
This seems like a winner for a wide demographic. Whether you need a reliable dining or workspace at home, a pop-up table for outdoor events, or something flexible for a small studio, its adaptability shines. Families with kids might enjoy its stain resistance, while entertainers could benefit equally from its sleek appearance and solid weight capacity for all kinds of setups.

**Disadvantages**

- At 36 inches, the table might not feel expansive enough for tasks requiring multiple people or large equipment.
- The surface's pure white color, although easy to clean, does tend to show smudges and fingerprints more prominently.
- Because the legs fold flush into the table, extra care is needed while closing it not to catch fingers—definitely something to watch out for.
  
**Other Options**  
When it comes to folding tables, it’s hard not to compare this one to peers like Lifetime’s square folding tables or Flash Furniture’s models. Lifetime tables offer slightly more robust outdoor capabilities with UV-protected tops, but they don’t quite match the sleek lock mechanism of the Alera option. On the other hand, Flash Furniture tables sometimes go the extra mile in color variety or additional features like thicker tabletops, although Alera ALEPT36SW holds an advantage in affordability.

**Financial Value**  
Considering what it brings to the table—pun intended—this folding table manages to pack in affordable quality without cutting corners. Not all folding tables merge compact storability with durability and style at this level. For occasional users or even frequent multi-purpose utilizers like myself, it feels worth every penny.

A few questions - 

1) what are the MUST DO excursions at either place? I wanna do “the hole” but idk if I can handle a 3 hour van ride 😳 

2) are the ruins spectacular? It’s 3 adults (me, hubs, my sister) and my fourteen year old boy (everything is “lame” right now - who even likes kids?! lol!) I know the adults will be fine… 

3) drink package - 2 of us don’t drink (465 days alcohol free for me!) but the Zero Proof is kinda intriguing to me… energy drinks before we go explore, bottled water, and club soda. But also with bubbles, club soda is included & I can bring Celsius packets and make my own energy drinks… my sister and son are rooming together. He’s not interested in anything but the soda package, she kinda wants the coffee one (zero proof). Do they both have to get the zero proof or could one do bubbles and one do ZP? 

4) it’s a 5 day - I read they have an 80s, 90s, and super hero night but can’t wear masks or face paint. Do they still do the silent white party? (Adult’s fav!) 

5) any tips on the stops or cruise in general? Must see shows? I’ve been on Sunrise - are they the same shows?

1nburgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1nburgq/coworker_has_no_manners/,Coworker has no manners,"My coworker drives me nuts.

I share a cubicle with someone who was raised in a barn or something.  The guy burps and belches constantly, chews with his mouth open, and slurps his coffee egregiously loud.  I've tried saying something to him about it but he just shrugged it off and I feel like continuing to press the point would just be a pointless argument.

I could complain to our manager, but given that it's not work/performance related, it doesn't feel like something worth complaining about because at best our manager would just say something to him and then he'd acknowledge it and then just keep doing it, with an added benefit of me him feeling like I'm a person who complains to managers about piddly shit, which isn't the type of person I want to be.

Asking to be moved to a different cubicle isn't really a feasible solution - we share a cubicle because we both do the same thing and need to be able to easily communicate.  Moving to different cubicles would just make communication harder for both of us.

Our manager *is* moving him to another team *eventually* when they can backfill his position, which they're working on, so *eventually* this problem will solve itself.

So the best I can do is just put on headphones and try to drown it out.  But my god is it annoying, and the guy has zero situational awareness to realize it.",1,1757354028.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Of course, you can already guess what happened. The coffee went straight onto my pants—sticky, hot, disgusting. All I got in return was a quick, half-hearted “sorry” before she just walked away like nothing had happened.😒

I had classes, then I was heading straight to work, and now I’m forced to sit in this sticky mess for the rest of the day. Honestly, what the hell is going on? Why do some people have zero awareness of the world around them?

If you’re one of those people who has to shout into your phone in public transit, and sometimes even puts it on speaker just to make sure everyone suffers through your conversation, please stop. And if you’re holding a shitty cup of coffee at the same time, maybe think twice before pushing through a crowded bus like you’re the only person alive. It’s not complicated—it’s called *courtesy*.

Looking for someone who’s tired of swiping and wants something deeper. I’m a laid-back, 5’8” guy with a warm sense of humor and a love for balancing cozy nights with spontaneous adventures. After work, I unwind with gaming (RPGs, indie titles, or anything with a good story) or exploring underrated spots—like Astra Lumina, that trippy forest art exhibit I checked out last month. Concerts, museums, and low-key hangs are my vibe, but I’m equally down for marathoning shows or debating the best way to eat a taco at 2AM.

I value loyalty, honesty, and emotional openness. Life’s messy, and I’m not here to judge—just to build a partnership where we can laugh at inside jokes, hug it out when things get tough, and push each other to grow. You’re introverted but have a big heart, maybe a little nerdy about something (tell me your obscure passion), and prioritize health without taking life too seriously.

If you can make some pho, you have my attention.

Not on apps because they feel impersonal. If you’re a homebody who occasionally craves live music or deep talks under the stars, let’s chat. No rush—just two weirdos seeing if our chaos aligns.

About me: Peanut butter-skinned, 160lbs, affectionate, and the designated Wi-Fi fixer in every friend group. I’ll make you laugh, remember your coffee order, and stick around when things get real.

If you’re looking for a loyal, drama-free connection (and someone to steal hoodies from), DM me. Let’s trade stories and playlists first.

I'm not looking to rush things, I want to make that connection, it's more than just a spark. ",1,1757353718.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1nbulic,https://i.redd.it/zfk8ivnmaznf1.jpeg,THE HOT SPOT: Facing cancer in Iowa: Patients share their stories,"# Cancer in Iowa isn’t just about treatment—it’s about surviving the system, asking why it happened, and living with the aftermath. Five Iowans share their stories.

*A version of this story first appeared in the* [*Aug. 19 edition*](https://link.iowastartingline.com/public/41202588) *of the Iowa Starting Line newsletter.* [*Subscribe to our newsletter*](https://iowastartingline.com/newsletter/) *to get an exclusive first look at a new story each Tuesday in our The Hot Spot: Investigating Cancer in Iowa series.*

Gano Whetstone settled into the infusion chair at Des Moines’ Mission Cancer + Blood and asked for her usual: black coffee and a warm blanket. On treatment days, she takes the paratransit bus to the hospital, arriving early to wait in the lobby until it’s her time.

The 80-year-old retired teacher has done this routine every three weeks for nearly a year now. The nurse wheels over a machine and hooks it up to Whetstone’s infusion port—a device surgically installed in her shoulder that allows her to receive her slow drip of Herceptin on treatment days without requiring the poke of a needle.

“I don’t feel anything,” she says, watching the IV work. “I just sit here, drink my coffee, and watch TV.”

It sounds mundane, but Whetstone said catching the cancer feels miraculous.

Last July during a routine mammogram, doctors found what was likely a cancerous tumor in her breast tissue.

“I just looked at the floor,” she said, as the doctor delivered the news.

For the last year, Whetstone has been navigating the aftermath of that moment—a journey familiar to many cancer patients across Iowa who face a complex matrix of decisions about their care.

This week on [The Hot Spot: Investigating Cancer in Iowa,](https://iowastartingline.com/cancer-in-iowa/) we‘re sharing some of those stories. Cancer in Iowa isn’t just about receiving a diagnosis and figuring out the right treatment. It’s navigating hurdles related to insurance and care; wondering what might have caused the disease in the first place; and living with the physical and emotional aftermath long after the last scan.

Whetstone’s doctor offered her three options: radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. When her mother went through cancer treatment decades earlier, she remembered watching her struggle with the side effects of chemo. Seeing her mother lose her hair was a memory that stuck with her.

“You never really understand a lot of it when they’re explaining it to you,” Whetstone said.

Instead of chemotherapy or radiation, she decided to go with immunotherapy because it had side effects she was willing to manage. Keeping her hair was a bonus.

Her doctor prescribed a course of Herceptin. It’s sometimes used to treat breast and stomach cancers by blocking a particular protein that promotes cancer cell growth. The drug is estimated to have saved more than [3 million lives](https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/25-years-herceptin-groundbreaking-advancement-breast-cancer) since its introduction in 1998. The rub: Herceptin—a brand name for the chemical trastuzumab—is expensive.

Whetstone said each infusion treatment costs around $5,000, a fortune on a fixed income. Even with Medicare, Whetstone couldn’t afford the mounting costs. She applied for an elderly waiver to get Medicaid coverage, then hit another wall when the surgeon’s office initially said they wouldn’t take her insurance. Three phone calls and three-and-a-half weeks of waiting later, she finally got approval for the surgery.

“If \[the insurance companies\] make mistakes and stuff, you know, then you’re stuck waiting,” she said. “And you can’t have your surgery or treatment because they have to get the insurance straightened out.”

Whetstone lives in an apartment complex with a number of other elderly Iowans. When they meet once a week in the common area to talk about politics or the news, she said she wonders how her neighbors would fare navigating the system.

“There’s no way they can do this themselves,” she said. (She herself had help thanks to a service coordinator from Broadlawns Medical Center.)

As the machine beeps to signal her treatment is finished, Whetstone cautiously reflected on the road ahead. In two weeks, she’ll have her final infusion. And come September, a mammogram will determine if she’s in remission.

“They said, it looks good, and I feel really confident that it’ll be okay,” Whetstone said. “But the thing is, I did this before.”

Before starting her first dose of Herceptin, surgeons operated to remove the tumor in Whetstone’s breast. But within weeks, the cancer came back, and she needed a mastectomy. Now, with her immunotherapy complete, she hopes next month’s mammogram brings good news.

“I don’t wanna get false hope in here,” Whetstone said, “because I did last time. A lot of times I don’t even think about it. I just … go to the activities of my building and, you know, meet people and do things.”

# Rick Widman, Altoona

When Rick Widman was diagnosed in 2007 with  chronic lymphocytic leukemia, he wasn’t surprised.

His grandmother and an older brother both died of blood cancer; his mother died of breast cancer when he was a kid. All had lived on the family farm in Storm Lake.

Widman lists off others: His neighbor down the street. A classmate and her brother.

“So it’s just been all over the place, you know?” Widman said.

Now living in Altoona, Widman has his theories: He points to widely used herbicides glyphosate and atrazine, along with the petroleum chemical benzene. He also remembers using the insecticide DDT prior to its ban in 1972, and the herbicides 2,4-D and dicamba.

**RELATED:** [**How pesticides help fuel Iowa’s cancer crisis**](https://iowastartingline.com/cancer-in-iowa/pesticides-fuel-cancer-iowa-crisis/)

“My brother and I always thought that it had something to do with exposure to something on the farm,” Widman said.

His family’s case was interesting enough that Mayo Clinic is including Widman and his family in a study of families with blood and lymph node cancers. Widman says more of that research is needed.

“The federal government is cutting cancer research; they’re just doing the total opposite of what they should be doing,” he said. “And, really, the state’s not really doing as much as they should be doing. … I just don’t think that’s a priority.”

# AnMarie Rodgers, formerly of Newton

AnMarie Rodgers was diagnosed at age 55 with small cell lung cancer in summer 2024, and successfully had surgery to remove a piece “the size of a mango” from her lung. Fortunately, she did not have to undergo chemotherapy or radiation treatment.

“My surgeon is optimistic, and thinks if I get through five years, I have a pretty good outlook for a normal life,” said Rodgers, a Newton native now living in Oakland, California.

Recently, she had another lung scan on the one-year anniversary of her diagnosis, and said it “came back with no sign of recurrence, which is a huge relief.”

But Rodgers doesn’t have a history of smoking, so it surprised her to be diagnosed at all.

“The doctor said that the [rise of lung cancer in women who have never smoked](https://www.cdc.gov/lung-cancer/nonsmokers/index.html) is pretty widespread right now,” she said.

Research points to one likely factor that Iowa has plenty of: [radon](https://www.cdc.gov/radon/about/index.html).

Rodgers grew up in an upstairs bedroom of the family’s Newton home. As an adult, when she returned every few months to care for her mother, she’d sleep in a guest room in the basement.

“And so we did a radon test, and even the upstairs portion was over the limits \[of what’s considered safe\] for radon,” Rodgers said.

It’s not something she says folks talked about in Newton—but could if local officials got involved.

“I know that our family has always used the local ISU extension office … for help on, like, planting native grasses around our house and you know, crop rotation and set-aside land around the creek,” Rodgers said. “So I feel like a lot of people go into those offices for information, and just informing people about their radon risk would be helpful.”

And state and federal officials could help too.

“They should care about people’s health,” she said. “It’s so hard when \[you have\] what seems like a callous turning of your back to empathy and science and reason.”

# Leah Fisher, Waterloo

Leah Fisher of Waterloo is a four-year breast cancer survivor. But there’s no history of breast cancer in her family, which has led her to consider other possible causes.

“I was raised on the east side of Waterloo, and I know we have a lot of manufacturing facilities,” she said. “It could have been environmental. So that worries me.”

At the top of her list is the former [Chamberlain Manufacturing Company](https://thenewwaterloo.com/project/former-chamberlain-site/), which produced munitions beginning in World War II until it closed in the mid-1990s. It was designated a “brownfields” site and has gone through expensive cleanups from federal and local sources since the early 2000s.

The Environmental Protection Agency found the soil on that site [contaminated with “several metals and semi-volatile compounds,”](https://www.epa.gov/ia/former-chamberlain-manufacturing-site-waterloo-black-hawk-county-iowa-fact-sheet-july-2021) including arsenic, lead, and cadmium. It also found groundwater contamination and “vapor intrusion of trichloroethylene” in nearby homes.

[Arsenic](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/arsenic.html), [cadmium](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/cadmium), and [trichloroethylene](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/trichloroethylene) are known cancer-causing chemicals. [Lead is a probable carcinogen](https://www.lung.org/clean-air/indoor-air/indoor-air-pollutants/lead), according to the EPA.

“It’s a lot of minority Black women or Black people on the east side of town that are greatly impacted by cancer, whether it be breast cancer, colon, prostate, whatever,” Fisher said. “So that scares me.”

Among Black residents getting cancer, Iowa ranks No. 2 in the nation and No. 3 for deaths, [according to the Iowa Cancer Registry](https://shri.public-health.uiowa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Spotlight-Series_Cancer-in-Iowas-Black-Population_May-2024.pdf). Black Iowans have the highest rate of cancer and cancer deaths among all ethnicities, even accounting for income levels.

While breast cancer is the most common cancer for all Iowa women, Black women still die of it at greater rates.

Fisher received treatment at a different hospital from where she was diagnosed. She said people shouldn’t be afraid to ask for a second opinion, and be willing to go out of state if they’re not finding care they need here.

“Thank God I was blessed with a great support system,” she said. “But you do have to advocate for yourself and try to do your research.”

Her other advice for those dealing with a cancer diagnosis?

“Give yourself grace,” she said. “Give yourself patience. You can beat this. This is not the final step.”

# Karen Kinney, Waterloo

Karen Kinney of Waterloo was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer in September 2019, and went through surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation at University of Iowa Health Care.

But cancer patients know that’s not the end of the story: Kinney’s also dealt with years of follow-up appointments to make sure the cancer doesn’t return, which comes with its own minefields.

“In October of this year, I’ll be five years cancer free,” she said. “I celebrate that, but I also deal with the aftermath of that financially, emotionally, psychologically—is it gonna come back?”

It’s something the word “survivor” doesn’t quite capture.

“Even though people like myself beat cancer, the aftermath—once you’re cured or in remission—goes on for a lifetime,” Kinney said. “You are a totally different person from when you were diagnosed with cancer. Unless you’ve been told you have cancer, you can’t really understand the physical and mental \[impacts\] of dealing with the cancer afterwards.”

So she was excited to join the cancer listening tour that came to Waterloo in August, put on by [The Harkin Institute](https://harkininstitute.drake.edu/), the [Iowa Environmental Council](https://www.iaenvironment.org/) (IEC), and the [Iowa Farmers Union](https://iowafarmersunion.org/) (IFU).

“I have concerns with Iowa and our water, our air quality, and I feel that these things are contributing to the cancer levels in Iowa,” she said. “And I’d like to have something done about that, and I’ll be involved at whatever capacity I can to help with that, and to get the story out that we need to do something more about cancer in Iowa.”

Kinney isn’t alone; hundreds of Iowans have said the same at listening sessions held around the state this summer, said Kerri Johannsen, IEC’s senior director of policy and programs, who has attended several.

“Everyone sees it. They see it all too closely in their lives,” Johannsen said. “They go into Casey’s in town, and every day there’s a new cancer benefit … It’s really hard to ignore.”

With some of the highest rates of cancer in the nation, Iowans are [starting to think it’s more](https://artcullen.substack.com/p/iowans-are-waking-up) than just factors everyone deals with, like genetics, consuming alcohol, or smoking tobacco.

“People do not feel like they have good information about what environmental risk factors might be contributing to cancer rates, and they want to know,” Johannsen said.

And the “do something” part Kinney wants to help with? That’s “the next phase,” said Tommy Hexter, policy director with the IFU, who hosted the Waterloo listening session.

“We’re going to be up at the statehouse. We are going to have policy objectives that we hope will reverse the trends of cancer in Iowa,” he said. “We are very confident that, with the Iowans around the state that are concerned about this issue, legislators will want to take action to make Iowa a better place.”",1,1757353665.0,ames,0,1.0,False

I'm incredibly excited to share my very first custom component for Home Assistant: **FuelVariationScrapingPT**! This is a project born out of my personal passion for home automation and a desire to make smart, money-saving decisions here in Portugal.

[Fuel Variation for the week badge](https://preview.redd.it/uh4u940caznf1.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d44314ca8b1a996dd3aa5aa4b3fadac140c64c5)

**What is it?** This integration is designed specifically for **Portugal 🇵🇹**. It scrapes the *weekly fuel price variation page* from [precocombustiveis.pt](https://precocombustiveis.pt/) (a fantastic, transparent resource for fuel price variation predictions) and provides this crucial data directly as sensors in your Home Assistant.

**Why did I build this?** As someone just starting my journey into Home Assistant, I wanted a simple yet powerful way to integrate real-world data that directly impacts my daily life. With fuel prices being a constant topic, knowing the upcoming trend helps immensely with planning. Living in **Coimbra**, for example, it's great to know if I should fill up before Monday or wait!

**Key Features:**

* **Real-time Fuel Trends:** Get the predicted price changes for **Gasoline** and **Diesel** each week.
* **Variation Value:** See the exact price change in cents per liter (e.g., `+2.5 cents/L`).
* **Easy Automation:** Use these sensors to create powerful automations:
   * **""Fill Up Now!"" Notification:** Get a push notification on Sunday if prices are projected to rise significantly on Monday.
   * **Dashboard Insight:** Display current trends on your dashboard to quickly decide if it's a good time to visit the gas station.
   * **Budgeting:** Integrate fuel cost trends into your personal budgeting or smart home routines.

**Installation (via HACS):** The easiest way to get this up and running is through HACS (Home Assistant Community Store).

1. Add [`https://github.com/carolinabrasio/fuelvariationscrapingpt`](https://github.com/carolinabrasio/fuelvariationscrapingpt) as a custom repository (Category: Integration).
2. Install ""Fuel Variation Scraper Portugal"".
3. Add `sensor: - platform: fuelvariationscrapingpt` to your `configuration.yaml`.
4. Restart HA. *(Full manual installation instructions are also available in the Github README)*

**A Little About Me:** I'm a software developer who's recently fallen in love with home automation. This project is just one of many ideas I have, and I'm excited to contribute to this amazing community. It's been a fun challenge.

**Your Feedback is Gold!** Please test it out and let me know what you think! Any feedback, bug reports, or suggestions for improvements are highly appreciated. Feel free to open an issue or a PR on GitHub.

If this integration saves you a trip to the gas station or helps you manage your budget, consider buying me a coffee ☕️. Your support truly motivates me to keep building and improving! [https://ko-fi.com/carolinabrasio](https://ko-fi.com/carolinabrasio)

“My brother and I always thought that it had something to do with exposure to something on the farm,” Widman said.

His family’s case was interesting enough that Mayo Clinic is including Widman and his family in a study of families with blood and lymph node cancers. Widman says more of that research is needed.

“The federal government is cutting cancer research; they’re just doing the total opposite of what they should be doing,” he said. “And, really, the state’s not really doing as much as they should be doing. … I just don’t think that’s a priority.”

# AnMarie Rodgers, formerly of Newton

AnMarie Rodgers was diagnosed at age 55 with small cell lung cancer in summer 2024, and successfully had surgery to remove a piece “the size of a mango” from her lung. Fortunately, she did not have to undergo chemotherapy or radiation treatment.

“My surgeon is optimistic, and thinks if I get through five years, I have a pretty good outlook for a normal life,” said Rodgers, a Newton native now living in Oakland, California.

Recently, she had another lung scan on the one-year anniversary of her diagnosis, and said it “came back with no sign of recurrence, which is a huge relief.”

But Rodgers doesn’t have a history of smoking, so it surprised her to be diagnosed at all.

“The doctor said that the [rise of lung cancer in women who have never smoked](https://www.cdc.gov/lung-cancer/nonsmokers/index.html) is pretty widespread right now,” she said.

Research points to one likely factor that Iowa has plenty of: [radon](https://www.cdc.gov/radon/about/index.html).

Rodgers grew up in an upstairs bedroom of the family’s Newton home. As an adult, when she returned every few months to care for her mother, she’d sleep in a guest room in the basement.

“And so we did a radon test, and even the upstairs portion was over the limits \[of what’s considered safe\] for radon,” Rodgers said.

It’s not something she says folks talked about in Newton—but could if local officials got involved.

“I know that our family has always used the local ISU extension office … for help on, like, planting native grasses around our house and you know, crop rotation and set-aside land around the creek,” Rodgers said. “So I feel like a lot of people go into those offices for information, and just informing people about their radon risk would be helpful.”

And state and federal officials could help too.

“They should care about people’s health,” she said. “It’s so hard when \[you have\] what seems like a callous turning of your back to empathy and science and reason.”

# Leah Fisher, Waterloo

Leah Fisher of Waterloo is a four-year breast cancer survivor. But there’s no history of breast cancer in her family, which has led her to consider other possible causes.

“I was raised on the east side of Waterloo, and I know we have a lot of manufacturing facilities,” she said. “It could have been environmental. So that worries me.”

At the top of her list is the former [Chamberlain Manufacturing Company](https://thenewwaterloo.com/project/former-chamberlain-site/), which produced munitions beginning in World War II until it closed in the mid-1990s. It was designated a “brownfields” site and has gone through expensive cleanups from federal and local sources since the early 2000s.

The Environmental Protection Agency found the soil on that site [contaminated with “several metals and semi-volatile compounds,”](https://www.epa.gov/ia/former-chamberlain-manufacturing-site-waterloo-black-hawk-county-iowa-fact-sheet-july-2021) including arsenic, lead, and cadmium. It also found groundwater contamination and “vapor intrusion of trichloroethylene” in nearby homes.

[Arsenic](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/arsenic.html), [cadmium](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/cadmium), and [trichloroethylene](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/trichloroethylene) are known cancer-causing chemicals. [Lead is a probable carcinogen](https://www.lung.org/clean-air/indoor-air/indoor-air-pollutants/lead), according to the EPA.

“It’s a lot of minority Black women or Black people on the east side of town that are greatly impacted by cancer, whether it be breast cancer, colon, prostate, whatever,” Fisher said. “So that scares me.”

Among Black residents getting cancer, Iowa ranks No. 2 in the nation and No. 3 for deaths, [according to the Iowa Cancer Registry](https://shri.public-health.uiowa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Spotlight-Series_Cancer-in-Iowas-Black-Population_May-2024.pdf). Black Iowans have the highest rate of cancer and cancer deaths among all ethnicities, even accounting for income levels.

While breast cancer is the most common cancer for all Iowa women, Black women still die of it at greater rates.

Fisher received treatment at a different hospital from where she was diagnosed. She said people shouldn’t be afraid to ask for a second opinion, and be willing to go out of state if they’re not finding care they need here.

“Thank God I was blessed with a great support system,” she said. “But you do have to advocate for yourself and try to do your research.”

Her other advice for those dealing with a cancer diagnosis?

“Give yourself grace,” she said. “Give yourself patience. You can beat this. This is not the final step.”

# Karen Kinney, Waterloo

Karen Kinney of Waterloo was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer in September 2019, and went through surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation at University of Iowa Health Care.

But cancer patients know that’s not the end of the story: Kinney’s also dealt with years of follow-up appointments to make sure the cancer doesn’t return, which comes with its own minefields.

“In October of this year, I’ll be five years cancer free,” she said. “I celebrate that, but I also deal with the aftermath of that financially, emotionally, psychologically—is it gonna come back?”

It’s something the word “survivor” doesn’t quite capture.

“Even though people like myself beat cancer, the aftermath—once you’re cured or in remission—goes on for a lifetime,” Kinney said. “You are a totally different person from when you were diagnosed with cancer. Unless you’ve been told you have cancer, you can’t really understand the physical and mental \[impacts\] of dealing with the cancer afterwards.”

So she was excited to join the cancer listening tour that came to Waterloo in August, put on by [The Harkin Institute](https://harkininstitute.drake.edu/), the [Iowa Environmental Council](https://www.iaenvironment.org/) (IEC), and the [Iowa Farmers Union](https://iowafarmersunion.org/) (IFU).

“I have concerns with Iowa and our water, our air quality, and I feel that these things are contributing to the cancer levels in Iowa,” she said. “And I’d like to have something done about that, and I’ll be involved at whatever capacity I can to help with that, and to get the story out that we need to do something more about cancer in Iowa.”

Kinney isn’t alone; hundreds of Iowans have said the same at listening sessions held around the state this summer, said Kerri Johannsen, IEC’s senior director of policy and programs, who has attended several.

“Everyone sees it. They see it all too closely in their lives,” Johannsen said. “They go into Casey’s in town, and every day there’s a new cancer benefit … It’s really hard to ignore.”

With some of the highest rates of cancer in the nation, Iowans are [starting to think it’s more](https://artcullen.substack.com/p/iowans-are-waking-up) than just factors everyone deals with, like genetics, consuming alcohol, or smoking tobacco.

“People do not feel like they have good information about what environmental risk factors might be contributing to cancer rates, and they want to know,” Johannsen said.

And the “do something” part Kinney wants to help with? That’s “the next phase,” said Tommy Hexter, policy director with the IFU, who hosted the Waterloo listening session.

“We’re going to be up at the statehouse. We are going to have policy objectives that we hope will reverse the trends of cancer in Iowa,” he said. “We are very confident that, with the Iowans around the state that are concerned about this issue, legislators will want to take action to make Iowa a better place.”

1nbuk98,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1nbuk98/power_of_yes_oc_lore_story_and_power_scaling_help/,"Power of Yes - OC (Lore, story and power scaling help)","SFW based   
Okay so... a couple of days back, I watched a movie on common sense manipulation. It was mostly a parody nsfw but an idea struck me. It's probably been used throughout ages so I wanted to tweak it and add more lore, story and a good power system to it.

Essentially, there's a kid who doesn't have powers in a world where everyone does. It's like if you have powers and reproduce with a person without a power, the child will always be powerless. a + a = a, a + b = b sort of thing.

So, people who have powers are referred to as vessels and those without are... drumroll please; nonvessels.  
All vessel powers are related to what humans have struggled with in the chronicle of their existence, like being slow, speedster vessel; modern use in Babylon (the largest city and the story setting), for illegal speedster races, delivery people. It's always that for a problem, a vessel is born.

Now, the story will have two protagonists, the mc, axel and the voice in his head that is polite but has zero understanding of the world. (Naive alien)

The voice appears out of nowhere when the mc is at his lowest, losing his respect, cool and being mocked about his status, absent parents, infront of his crush. Hard stuff a boy cannot handle. He goes to a nearby cafe, sits down and sips coffee to ease his senses and gets greeted by the voice who thrusts the power of yes down his veins.

Power of yes grants the user the ability to command anyone to do anything as long as the user has higher willpower and recent goodwill than the target. aka, if he does a good thing, like sacrifice something and has higher will than the target, his power will suffice and can then command anything.

Now, another aspect of the story, powers can be upgraded with margins, these are unlocked by having higher willpower and getting something (I dont know what, I forgot I guess.)

But anyways, the margins are in a descending order from 10 to 1, 1  to 3 being impossible since only royals ever unlock them fast enough to ascend to the throne (many thrones in the city since Babylon is only named city but the size is of russia).

Now, I imagine the story to be a thriller mystery because, every mc needs an equally wronged but villainous antagonist. So, I present, the ***Pretender****.*  
*Starts* out as a swapper, someone who swaps souls with another person to take the boring parts of their work. Limit is upto 12hrs and anything more will cause excruciating pain for both individuals and can cause death for both. When the swapper switches his body with the target, he won't be able to use their ability.  
  
Furthermore, the swapper needs to perform a ritual of consent (I need help on this), granting consent from the soul of the user and the target with the will of the universe that they want to be swapped. (Lengthy process for binding but quite short for nullification)  
  
When Axel gets the power of yes, the swapper already has his own power as the swapper but, three days prior to Axel being blessed with the power of yes, the swapper user went through a tragedy (his mother got killed and his sister was hospitalized and needed urgent money.) Since swappers had the op ability, a bit of social engineering and manipulation allowed them to use the body of the target while they are asleep in the swapper's body (considering the swap happened) to commit crimes, the culprit would be the swapped individual and not the swapper, it's literally his face on the tv.

The antagonist does this, gets caught and just before he decides to surrender, a voice calls out to him, ""Grim"" as dubbed by him. Swappers would be traditionally forced to a two margin system, 10 to 9, with the only upgrade being the time going from 9hrs to 12hrs. (The guy already has the upgrade.)

but then the voice would tell him that he just gained another one! how convenient.  
What upgrade you may ask? just get the target to say yes to any disguised consent of swapping. (police officers know that swappers need to do rituals and stuff so they were casual until it worked.) What follows is gonna be the police guy in the swappers body trying to convince his colleagues that he got swapped (the body of the first guy that the swapper would swap, meaning the swapped guy in the first time was stuck in the body of the swapper guy)

I was thinking that the story would be a king vs jester type thing, the king portraying the will of authority and the jester (pretender in this case) symbolizing rebellion against authority. The swapper guy, would slowly go insane (partly due to losing his family, being whispered things by the voice and having a sadistic personality by default.) Going on to kill three non-vessels, deeming them unfit. \*3 days after, axel gets his powers.\* So, it would be that, humans faced this difficulty/problem and instead of a newborn getting the power, an existing non vessel got it, it would be cleared by a prophecy of sorts later on.

Essentially, endgame would be that the pretender, went crazy and killed himself and the voice, by time had associated itself with the pretender, took on his personality and didnt realize that the original dude died of his insanity and grief of realizing the horrors he committed, he was a human after all type of trope. Axel, initially, after losing his sister to the murderer infront of his eyes and being blamed for the death by a passerby (nonvessel cuz yk the formula.) was wanted on a k.o.s, he decided to use his powers and a few ""willing"" friends to investigate the real killer.

Endgame, the swapper, manipulates mass media through the use of screens and tvs, gets them to feel positive about him (since he upgraded to max, ppl only need to view him as good to be possessed), also by this time, he gets the fog dimension within his soul, a type of area where the souls of all the people he swaps get trapped within, meaning that the people that he swaps with, leave their body and go straight into his pocket. (He can also use the powers of the people that he purges into his realm.) I didn't realize how much this use the powers of the consumed alternated in similarity of afo from mha, I personally never watched the anime.

Axel also gets maxed out on his power and needs the exact same requirements. but, he doesnt control them mindlessly and only requests their help. 

idk the fight part but the ending, what I wrote for lore on ms word:  
Lore: The fog is the true inhabitation of all the vessels powers. The story is like a time loop. The switcheroo survives because if he doesn’t, the world with powers doesn’t either. He’s the pretender and custodian of the mist. Forged with the souls of all the sacrificed, the vessel powers influence matter and diamatter. Aka, he has similar abilities of crowd control like the power of yes.

Power of yes max power: Margin -1: Billions at once. Margin -1 can only be reached when public opinion is immensely in the favor of the protagonist and the power of yes voice grants the seal of traits and merges the entire consciousness into a single dimorphus sea of consciousness, resulting in a total bliss of all human souls in favor. Thus creating the first astral race. (idk what the fuck im talking about myself.)

I am totally new with this and I have no idea what to do with this coffee machine.
My bro in law got this free coffee machine at his work, probably in UK or some European country i'm not sure. Its kind of different than what he has, so he gave it to me. I have no idea about coffee capsules or pods so i thought i'll do my research.
Turns out, this particular coffee machine needs specific coffee capsule and not the normal nespresso ones(thats what chatgpt said) and i'm so confused on what to buy.
It specifically said to use Segafredo’s own capsules as only that will fit. And not to use normal nespresso or generic pods. I was devasted. 
It gave me a link to buy coffee pods from this place..

1nbuj4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tipstor/comments/1nbuj4c/how_ai_is_shaping_the_next_global_cultural/,How AI is Shaping the Next Global Cultural Revolution,"The marketplace is no longer confined to concrete, cash registers, or even websites. It’s expanding into the metaverse, a chaotic digital bazaar where avatars trade in status and stories as much as they do in products. Layer AI onto this shifting landscape, and the result is not just commerce but cultural alchemy. This is AI-driven cultural resonance. Products sculpted to sync with global moods, generational quirks, and the invisible undercurrents of culture itself. What once took years of trend-spotting now unfolds in seconds, with algorithms translating social whispers into business decisions before most executives have even had their morning coffee.

The scale of the opportunity is staggering. McKinsey estimates that the metaverse could generate up to USD 5 trillion in value by 2030, while PwC points to AI’s potential USD 15.7 trillion boost to the global economy over the same horizon. Together, these forces create a feedback loop where cultural trends no longer follow products. They drive them. When UN Tourism reports global travel back at 99% of pre-pandemic levels in 2024 with a further 5% surge in early 2025, it signals not just movement but appetite. People aren’t just booking flights. They’re consuming cultures, and AI is teaching businesses to serve that hunger in real time.

Lifecycle management turns this chaos into choreography. Instead of siloed product launches, customer lifecycles, and business strategies, AI integrates them into one living system. A spike in interest for sustainable streetwear in Seoul can trigger product shifts in Los Angeles, with supply chains adjusting automatically. If weather data predicts a blistering summer in Southern Europe, beverage companies can design and release cooling elixirs in the metaverse first. Test-driving them with digital consumers before investing in physical distribution. Real-time behavioral signals fuse with lifecycle modeling to keep companies ahead of the curve and in tune with global tastes.

The case studies already read like dispatches from the future. Nike’s virtual sneaker drops in Roblox blurred the line between gaming and fashion, with limited-edition digital kicks reselling for more than their physical counterparts. Gucci built entire digital gardens where users interacted with cultural artifacts before stepping into stores, creating resonance between the digital and physical worlds. Meanwhile, smaller players are experimenting with AI-driven metaverse pop-ups, where new products debut alongside cultural conversations. Aligning launches with everything from K-pop album drops to sustainability protests.

The new trend is clear. AI isn’t just optimizing. It’s orchestrating. It reads sentiment across borders, translates memes into market signals, and ensures that when a cultural shift hits, the product is already waiting. AI-driven cultural resonance isn’t about riding the wave. It’s about seeing the tide turn before anyone else, embedding products into the very fabric of global conversation. In a metaverse economy projected to be worth trillions, the brands that master this won’t just sell. They’ll define what culture feels like in both the digital and physical worlds.

1nbug64,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1nbug64/reveal_if_clean_people_laundry_detergent_sheets/,Reveal if Clean People Laundry Detergent Sheets Really Work,"I recently decided to switch up my laundry routine, and that's where Clean People Laundry Detergent Sheets came into play. It’s easy to be skeptical about detergent sheets if, like me, you’re used to the bulky liquid containers or pods, but I was intrigued by the eco-friendly claims and overall simplicity this product offered. Within just a few loads, my household became quite familiar with these sheets—and it’s been an interesting journey to say the least.

**Design and Packaging**  
The first thing that struck me about Clean People Laundry Detergent Sheets was the recyclable packaging. It’s compact, lightweight, and doesn’t take up nearly as much space as those heavy liquid detergent bottles. The packaging alone made me feel good about reducing plastic waste in my household. Upon opening the box, the fresh scent—subtle but clean—was immediately noticeable, which earned an instant thumbs up from my ever-picky nose. Unlike liquid detergent that often causes spills (one too many sticky messes on the shelf for my liking), these sheets are mess-free and easy to handle. No dripping, no measuring, just toss and go.

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
When it came to fighting stains and maintaining fresh clothes, these sheets delivered better than expected. My kids, who seem to be professional mud wrestlers based on the state of their outfits, really put this detergent to the test. Grass stains and sticky juice spills? Gone without a trace. Even my gym clothes came out smelling fresh and looking new after a wash, which I was particularly impressed by. There were a couple of tougher stains—like an older coffee spill on a white shirt—that needed a little extra scrubbing beforehand, but for regular everyday laundry, these sheets did more than hold their own.

[Check Clean People Laundry Detergent Sheets price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b0dd4xz2yb/)  

**Ease of Use**  
Using these sheets might be the easiest thing I’ve ever done for laundry. You just grab one sheet (two if your load is enormous), throw it in with your clothes, and forget about it. Since the sheets dissolve completely in water, there’s no residue left behind, which has been a problem I’ve encountered with some other cleaners. Plus, they’re compatible with all machines, including high-efficiency ones, so no worries about compatibility issues there. I even tested them with a few different wash temperatures just to see—hot, cold, and warm—and the sheets performed equally well, which was a huge win.

**Skin-Friendliness and Hypoallergenic Benefits**  
As someone with sensitive skin in the household (looking at you, Uncle Jerry), anything that’s moderately harsh gets vetoed out of the game quickly. Thankfully, this detergent is hypoallergenic and didn’t irritate skin at all, even after multiple washes. The clean ingredients speak volumes, and it’s evident in how gentle the product is, not just on clothes but on skin as well.

**Strengths**  
- Compact, eco-friendly recyclable packaging reduces waste.  
- Effective stain removal for most everyday dirt and messes.  
- Hypoallergenic and ideal for sensitive skin types.  
- Works well in cold, warm, or hot water.  
- Compatible with all washing machines, including HE models.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Heavily set-in or older stains may need pre-treatment for better results.  
- While the fresh scent is lovely, some might find it too subtle if they prefer heavily perfumed laundry.  

**Competing Products**  
Clean People Laundry Detergent Sheets face competition from established brands like Tru Earth Laundry Strips and Dropps detergent pods. Tru Earth offers a similar eco-friendly sheet system but has a slightly stronger scent, which some might prefer, though Clean People outshines it in terms of ultimate skin-friendliness. Dropps pods are a close contender due to their biodegradable claims and strong cleaning power. However, pods can sometimes leave a bit of a sticky residue, which is nonexistent with the detergent sheets. Overall, Clean People stands out by balancing efficiency, environmental friendliness, and gentleness in a compact package.

**Bang for the Buck**  
While I won’t mention the exact price tag, the cost of Clean People Laundry Detergent Sheets feels entirely reasonable considering the benefits. Each sheet is pre-measured, so there’s no wasted detergent, and the thin, lightweight packaging means you’re not paying extra for unnecessary bulk. Plus, the eco-friendly angle potentially saves some guilt in addition to money. Compared to paying for bulky plastic-filled brands, these sheets seem to offer good value where both the planet and your laundry are concerned.

1nbufke,https://i.redd.it/g0y105li9znf1.jpeg,THE HOT SPOT: Facing cancer in Iowa: Patients share their stories,"# Cancer in Iowa isn’t just about treatment—it’s about surviving the system, asking why it happened, and living with the aftermath. Five Iowans share their stories.

*A version of this story first appeared in the* [*Aug. 19 edition*](https://link.iowastartingline.com/public/41202588) *of the Iowa Starting Line newsletter.* [*Subscribe to our newsletter*](https://iowastartingline.com/newsletter/) *to get an exclusive first look at a new story each Tuesday in our The Hot Spot: Investigating Cancer in Iowa series.*

Gano Whetstone settled into the infusion chair at Des Moines’ Mission Cancer + Blood and asked for her usual: black coffee and a warm blanket. On treatment days, she takes the paratransit bus to the hospital, arriving early to wait in the lobby until it’s her time.

The 80-year-old retired teacher has done this routine every three weeks for nearly a year now. The nurse wheels over a machine and hooks it up to Whetstone’s infusion port—a device surgically installed in her shoulder that allows her to receive her slow drip of Herceptin on treatment days without requiring the poke of a needle.

“I don’t feel anything,” she says, watching the IV work. “I just sit here, drink my coffee, and watch TV.”

It sounds mundane, but Whetstone said catching the cancer feels miraculous.

Last July during a routine mammogram, doctors found what was likely a cancerous tumor in her breast tissue.

“I just looked at the floor,” she said, as the doctor delivered the news.

For the last year, Whetstone has been navigating the aftermath of that moment—a journey familiar to many cancer patients across Iowa who face a complex matrix of decisions about their care.

This week on [The Hot Spot: Investigating Cancer in Iowa,](https://iowastartingline.com/cancer-in-iowa/) we‘re sharing some of those stories. Cancer in Iowa isn’t just about receiving a diagnosis and figuring out the right treatment. It’s navigating hurdles related to insurance and care; wondering what might have caused the disease in the first place; and living with the physical and emotional aftermath long after the last scan.

Whetstone’s doctor offered her three options: radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. When her mother went through cancer treatment decades earlier, she remembered watching her struggle with the side effects of chemo. Seeing her mother lose her hair was a memory that stuck with her.

“You never really understand a lot of it when they’re explaining it to you,” Whetstone said.

Instead of chemotherapy or radiation, she decided to go with immunotherapy because it had side effects she was willing to manage. Keeping her hair was a bonus.

Her doctor prescribed a course of Herceptin. It’s sometimes used to treat breast and stomach cancers by blocking a particular protein that promotes cancer cell growth. The drug is estimated to have saved more than [3 million lives](https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/25-years-herceptin-groundbreaking-advancement-breast-cancer) since its introduction in 1998. The rub: Herceptin—a brand name for the chemical trastuzumab—is expensive.

Whetstone said each infusion treatment costs around $5,000, a fortune on a fixed income. Even with Medicare, Whetstone couldn’t afford the mounting costs. She applied for an elderly waiver to get Medicaid coverage, then hit another wall when the surgeon’s office initially said they wouldn’t take her insurance. Three phone calls and three-and-a-half weeks of waiting later, she finally got approval for the surgery.

“If \[the insurance companies\] make mistakes and stuff, you know, then you’re stuck waiting,” she said. “And you can’t have your surgery or treatment because they have to get the insurance straightened out.”

Whetstone lives in an apartment complex with a number of other elderly Iowans. When they meet once a week in the common area to talk about politics or the news, she said she wonders how her neighbors would fare navigating the system.

“There’s no way they can do this themselves,” she said. (She herself had help thanks to a service coordinator from Broadlawns Medical Center.)

As the machine beeps to signal her treatment is finished, Whetstone cautiously reflected on the road ahead. In two weeks, she’ll have her final infusion. And come September, a mammogram will determine if she’s in remission.

“They said, it looks good, and I feel really confident that it’ll be okay,” Whetstone said. “But the thing is, I did this before.”

Before starting her first dose of Herceptin, surgeons operated to remove the tumor in Whetstone’s breast. But within weeks, the cancer came back, and she needed a mastectomy. Now, with her immunotherapy complete, she hopes next month’s mammogram brings good news.

“I don’t wanna get false hope in here,” Whetstone said, “because I did last time. A lot of times I don’t even think about it. I just … go to the activities of my building and, you know, meet people and do things.”

# Rick Widman, Altoona

When Rick Widman was diagnosed in 2007 with  chronic lymphocytic leukemia, he wasn’t surprised.

His grandmother and an older brother both died of blood cancer; his mother died of breast cancer when he was a kid. All had lived on the family farm in Storm Lake.

Widman lists off others: His neighbor down the street. A classmate and her brother.

“So it’s just been all over the place, you know?” Widman said.

Now living in Altoona, Widman has his theories: He points to widely used herbicides glyphosate and atrazine, along with the petroleum chemical benzene. He also remembers using the insecticide DDT prior to its ban in 1972, and the herbicides 2,4-D and dicamba.

“My brother and I always thought that it had something to do with exposure to something on the farm,” Widman said.

His family’s case was interesting enough that Mayo Clinic is including Widman and his family in a study of families with blood and lymph node cancers. Widman says more of that research is needed.

“The federal government is cutting cancer research; they’re just doing the total opposite of what they should be doing,” he said. “And, really, the state’s not really doing as much as they should be doing. … I just don’t think that’s a priority.”

# AnMarie Rodgers, formerly of Newton

AnMarie Rodgers was diagnosed at age 55 with small cell lung cancer in summer 2024, and successfully had surgery to remove a piece “the size of a mango” from her lung. Fortunately, she did not have to undergo chemotherapy or radiation treatment.

“My surgeon is optimistic, and thinks if I get through five years, I have a pretty good outlook for a normal life,” said Rodgers, a Newton native now living in Oakland, California.

Recently, she had another lung scan on the one-year anniversary of her diagnosis, and said it “came back with no sign of recurrence, which is a huge relief.”

But Rodgers doesn’t have a history of smoking, so it surprised her to be diagnosed at all.

“The doctor said that the [rise of lung cancer in women who have never smoked](https://www.cdc.gov/lung-cancer/nonsmokers/index.html) is pretty widespread right now,” she said.

Research points to one likely factor that Iowa has plenty of: [radon](https://www.cdc.gov/radon/about/index.html).

Rodgers grew up in an upstairs bedroom of the family’s Newton home. As an adult, when she returned every few months to care for her mother, she’d sleep in a guest room in the basement.

“And so we did a radon test, and even the upstairs portion was over the limits \[of what’s considered safe\] for radon,” Rodgers said.

It’s not something she says folks talked about in Newton—but could if local officials got involved.

“I know that our family has always used the local ISU extension office … for help on, like, planting native grasses around our house and you know, crop rotation and set-aside land around the creek,” Rodgers said. “So I feel like a lot of people go into those offices for information, and just informing people about their radon risk would be helpful.”

And state and federal officials could help too.

“They should care about people’s health,” she said. “It’s so hard when \[you have\] what seems like a callous turning of your back to empathy and science and reason.”

# Leah Fisher, Waterloo

Leah Fisher of Waterloo is a four-year breast cancer survivor. But there’s no history of breast cancer in her family, which has led her to consider other possible causes.

“I was raised on the east side of Waterloo, and I know we have a lot of manufacturing facilities,” she said. “It could have been environmental. So that worries me.”

At the top of her list is the former [Chamberlain Manufacturing Company](https://thenewwaterloo.com/project/former-chamberlain-site/), which produced munitions beginning in World War II until it closed in the mid-1990s. It was designated a “brownfields” site and has gone through expensive cleanups from federal and local sources since the early 2000s.

The Environmental Protection Agency found the soil on that site [contaminated with “several metals and semi-volatile compounds,”](https://www.epa.gov/ia/former-chamberlain-manufacturing-site-waterloo-black-hawk-county-iowa-fact-sheet-july-2021) including arsenic, lead, and cadmium. It also found groundwater contamination and “vapor intrusion of trichloroethylene” in nearby homes.

[Arsenic](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/arsenic.html), [cadmium](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/cadmium), and [trichloroethylene](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/trichloroethylene) are known cancer-causing chemicals. [Lead is a probable carcinogen](https://www.lung.org/clean-air/indoor-air/indoor-air-pollutants/lead), according to the EPA.

“It’s a lot of minority Black women or Black people on the east side of town that are greatly impacted by cancer, whether it be breast cancer, colon, prostate, whatever,” Fisher said. “So that scares me.”

Among Black residents getting cancer, Iowa ranks No. 2 in the nation and No. 3 for deaths, [according to the Iowa Cancer Registry](https://shri.public-health.uiowa.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-Spotlight-Series_Cancer-in-Iowas-Black-Population_May-2024.pdf). Black Iowans have the highest rate of cancer and cancer deaths among all ethnicities, even accounting for income levels.

While breast cancer is the most common cancer for all Iowa women, Black women still die of it at greater rates.

Fisher received treatment at a different hospital from where she was diagnosed. She said people shouldn’t be afraid to ask for a second opinion, and be willing to go out of state if they’re not finding care they need here.

“Thank God I was blessed with a great support system,” she said. “But you do have to advocate for yourself and try to do your research.”

Her other advice for those dealing with a cancer diagnosis?

“Give yourself grace,” she said. “Give yourself patience. You can beat this. This is not the final step.”

# Karen Kinney, Waterloo

Karen Kinney of Waterloo was diagnosed with stage four colon cancer in September 2019, and went through surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation at University of Iowa Health Care.

But cancer patients know that’s not the end of the story: Kinney’s also dealt with years of follow-up appointments to make sure the cancer doesn’t return, which comes with its own minefields.

“In October of this year, I’ll be five years cancer free,” she said. “I celebrate that, but I also deal with the aftermath of that financially, emotionally, psychologically—is it gonna come back?”

It’s something the word “survivor” doesn’t quite capture.

“Even though people like myself beat cancer, the aftermath—once you’re cured or in remission—goes on for a lifetime,” Kinney said. “You are a totally different person from when you were diagnosed with cancer. Unless you’ve been told you have cancer, you can’t really understand the physical and mental \[impacts\] of dealing with the cancer afterwards.”

So she was excited to join the cancer listening tour that came to Waterloo in August, put on by [The Harkin Institute](https://harkininstitute.drake.edu/), the [Iowa Environmental Council](https://www.iaenvironment.org/) (IEC), and the [Iowa Farmers Union](https://iowafarmersunion.org/) (IFU).

“I have concerns with Iowa and our water, our air quality, and I feel that these things are contributing to the cancer levels in Iowa,” she said. “And I’d like to have something done about that, and I’ll be involved at whatever capacity I can to help with that, and to get the story out that we need to do something more about cancer in Iowa.”

Kinney isn’t alone; hundreds of Iowans have said the same at listening sessions held around the state this summer, said Kerri Johannsen, IEC’s senior director of policy and programs, who has attended several.

“Everyone sees it. They see it all too closely in their lives,” Johannsen said. “They go into Casey’s in town, and every day there’s a new cancer benefit … It’s really hard to ignore.”

With some of the highest rates of cancer in the nation, Iowans are [starting to think it’s more](https://artcullen.substack.com/p/iowans-are-waking-up) than just factors everyone deals with, like genetics, consuming alcohol, or smoking tobacco.

“People do not feel like they have good information about what environmental risk factors might be contributing to cancer rates, and they want to know,” Johannsen said.

And the “do something” part Kinney wants to help with? That’s “the next phase,” said Tommy Hexter, policy director with the IFU, who hosted the Waterloo listening session.

“We’re going to be up at the statehouse. We are going to have policy objectives that we hope will reverse the trends of cancer in Iowa,” he said. “We are very confident that, with the Iowans around the state that are concerned about this issue, legislators will want to take action to make Iowa a better place.”",1,1757353303.0,Oncology,0,1.0,False

1nbu9gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1nbu9gp/does_sprayway_multipurpose_cleaner_really_deliver/,"Does Sprayway Multi-Purpose Cleaner Really Deliver? Honest Review for Granite, Glass, Wood, and Metal","The Sprayway SW007R Multi-Purpose Cleaner is a product I'd been curious about for a while, especially since maintaining a clean home can sometimes feel like a never-ending battle against grime, smudges, and stale odors. With its bold claim of being effective on a range of surfaces like granite, glass, wood, and metal, I decided to give this cleaner a go. Spoiler alert: it's definitely got some strengths, but there are a couple of things to consider depending on your cleaning needs.

**Design and Packaging**  
The first thing I noticed was how compact and lightweight this cleaner is. The 2.5 x 2.5 x 6-inch dimensions and 13.5 oz size make it easy to store and handle, even with limited cabinet space. It's also quite ergonomic; the spray nozzle distributes an even mist, so you don’t end up with too much liquid in concentrated spots. Bonus point—there was no leaking or clogging when I used it repeatedly for extended cleaning sessions, which is not always the case with similar products.

**Ease of Use**  
Using this cleaner is a breeze. You simply spray, wipe, and let the formula work its magic for tougher stains. I tried it on my kitchen countertops (granite), bathroom mirrors, and even the wooden coffee table that collects fingerprints faster than I can keep track of. For surfaces that aren't heavily soiled, it worked quickly, leaving everything looking spotless with minimal elbow grease. The quick-drying formula is another perk—I didn’t have to follow up with a second wipe to prevent streaks, especially on mirrors and glass.

[Check Sprayway SW007R price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b07k2dc76l/)  

**Good Aspects**  
This cleaner really does shine in several areas.  
- The fresh scent it leaves behind actually lasts, unlike some cleaners that smell good for two minutes and then barely register.  
- Effective against a variety of grime types—grease on my kitchen stove, soap scum on the bathroom sink, and sticky residue on a kid's toy were handled effortlessly.  
- It’s versatile enough to use on so many surfaces, which saved me from switching between multiple cleaners (especially handy mid-clean when motivation’s waning).  

**Bad Points**  
However, the Sprayway SW007R does have a couple of things you might want to think about.  
- While it did great on polished wooden surfaces, it left a slight residue on unfinished wood, which needed extra buffing.  
- It’s surprisingly powerful, so if you’re using it near food prep areas, I’d recommend wiping down with water afterward, just in case.  

**Target User**  
From my perspective, this cleaner is perfect for folks juggling a busy lifestyle who need something efficient and multipurpose. If, like me, you’re trying to clean and deodorize as quickly as possible, this handy product delivers. Parents, in particular, would love it for combating the daily mess that kids seem to generate from thin air. However, if your home has furniture made of unfinished or raw wood, you might want to test a patch first.

**Product Competitors**  
When it comes to multi-purpose cleaners, there’s no shortage of rivals competing for attention. The Method All-Purpose Cleaner has quite a loyal following and boasts an eco-friendly formula. While the Method cleaner smells fantastic and is gentler for people concerned about chemical exposure, I found the Sprayway SW007R outperformed it in terms of heavy-duty cleaning power and deodorizing ability. On the other hand, Mrs. Meyer’s Multi-Surface Cleaner competes strongly in terms of scent variety and natural formula, but the Sprayway edges it out for versatility, especially with tougher, stuck-on messes.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering its performance and how much time it saved me during cleaning sessions, I felt this product was worth the price. While it might not be the cheapest option, its versatility means you’re essentially getting four products in one, especially since it works well on granite, glass, wood, and metal. If you’re looking to minimize the number of cleaning agents under your sink while still getting results, this little can is a winner.

1nbu5h8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1nbu5h8/what_is_going_on/,WHAT IS GOING ON ?,"Lots of things happened today, all at once

So much confusion and mis and disinformation

Fearmongering and lots of I \*heard\* ""insane thing happening or going to happen""

Let's demystify and clarify a few things

\## What we KNOW happened

Today Sept 8, 2025 GenZ organized peaceful protests from Maitighar to Baneshwor and back to Baneshwor. Somewhere along the way, the protests was hijacked (bheed bhad ma, when emotions and confusion is high, people with alternate agenda <arsonists aago launa khojne, lootpat, public destruction and bad faith actors> rise and try to take advantage of this confusion circumstances especially when there is no clear leader or reliable person or figure to take instructions from.  
Social media ma we saw many comments regarding doing what happened in Bangladesh and other places - to riot in similar fashion - this was never the goal of today's protest.

But it happened, some bad faith actors started rioting, destroying walls and breaking into sansad bhawan - let me re-emphasize - this was never the goal of today's rally.

A very strong message was sent just by the sheer number of people present. And if no actions were taken by government, it would have escalate into stronger protests.

After the people broke in, CDO of Kathmandu district gave permission to fire at protestors (likely under upper commands). The permission to shoot was only given for rubber bullets.

But when the police started shooting, they did not just use rubber bullets, they open fired at civilians, protestors and bystanders indiscriminately. Wounds show that the police clearly targeted killing - rather than frightening or deescalating (shooting at head or stomach as opposed to shooting at ground near people to frighten or if necessary target non fatal organs). No with clear intent of murder, the police shot many people injuring many critically and killing some.

This incompetence at crowd control, open firing at bystanders and unarmed civilians just prove how loyal of lapdogs they are to the government and how bloodthirsty they truly are.

Protests continued till late in the evening, only dispersing around 7pm in many parts. After this we have some footage or police mobilizing and one of shooting at a person inside their home/shop.

Meanwhile after the entire day of enjoying chia/coffee PM has discussion with ministers, dedicate Home minister as scapegoat and make him resign. All day what were they doing? Where were they hiding? Why no one news of ok we will reconsider or postpone recent decisions. No nothing at all.

Another recent news - will Oli reconsider repealing Social Media act? No. After murdering children and unarmed civilians in cold blood, there is zero change or consideration.

Only goes to show once a murderer always a murderer. (search Madhes protests and killing)

After all that happened today, this guy still clings to his chair, shows no regret and does not apologize one bit. The very height and pinnacle of ghamand - his fall we will watch with great interest.

In summary

\- Planned peaceful protest about corruption and recent social media bans went south

\- Police brutally murdering and shooting unarmed people with no regard

\- Politicians safely enjoying another dinner having done ""fly-swatting""

\- They form a committee to investigate and report wrong doings in 15 days (just wow)

\- Some popular figures have urged ISPs to disobey government orders and have done so (allowing social media without dns change/vpn)

\## What are SPECULATIONS

As the evening has settled, multiple news and information of army being allowed to shoot on sight, police entering people's homes and murdering, going for r\*pes - we have no substantial evidence for any of them and is likely just fear mongering to prevent further gathering and mobilizing of people.

Also speculation about cutting off access to electricity and internet - also very unlikely. It will just add fuel to fire and more people on streets tomorrow.

Third tracking by social media - this can be done but if you have posted about your home/pictures etc on older photos/posts. If you haven't done so, or if you don't have photo online, don't share your picture with revealing background of home or surrounds - they can't track you.

Until proof is provided of this (stream on tiktok and send link over, send over video recordings we cannot prove this and believe it.

\## What NOW, what NEXT ?

Wait and see. First we need to be very clear about what has happened and what is going on. My post is an attempt at this, and people with more insights feel free to correct or make better post!

When we know where we are now - how many deaths (many people in critical condition in hospitals, may not survive, night raids etc)

Only then we can plan what next - no raid this neta house, burn that etc etc

No this is not silence, this is navigating the chaos.

Know where you are, know where you want to go - only then can we take step towards it

What are the general steps to do now

\- Civil disobedience - when not in danger, and without harming anyone/any public property,  
follow tactics such as graffiti, not going to office especially if you are enlisted as police/army

\- No taxes

\- Mourning period for the victims and help for the injured

\- Non violent direct action - protests - plans and strategies

\- Talk, talk talk. Keep talking - bounce around ideas and things that went right/wrong effectively.  
Be careful to share valid, verified information only and not spread disinformation only to cause more confusion and chaos.

\- Keep up with the news (official and social media)

Sorry I don't have much action items, but to have effective strategies, we need to wait and make calculated effective move, not rash emotional decisions.

What we do now will impact generations to come, so tread carefully.

You do not build a country in ONE DAY. Ek din ma desh bandaina

Ghar banauna ta mahinai, barsau lagcha, we are talking about building up our nation.

Nikalne ho political party heads lai, we WILL curb corruption - they spent decades building their empires, ek din mai dhalcha? Like they planned and executed, we need to plan and execute.

Change is on the horizon. With rise of leaders like Balen and Harka, we already see rays of it.

Let's not destroy what we worked so hard for by being in the heat of emotions. But also let us not be silent about it.

Tread carefully my friends, wait and see, then strike at the opportunity - not rush blindly without a plan or backup.

IKEA meatballs: delicious going in, evil coming out. I was halfway through the store maze when my stomach started making noises like an old washing machine. I figured I could let out a silent one while pretending to inspect a coffee table. Unfortunately, it was not silent. Or discreet.

The fart echoed like a cannon shot across the warehouse section. A kid three aisles down yelled, “MOM, SOMEONE POPPED A BALLOON!” I tried to speed-walk away but ran smack into the same family. The mom gave me that I know it was you glare while the kid pointed at me like I was the fart criminal of the century.

What works for you?,"Keeping house seems to be one of my biggest executive function struggles. I no longer feel a lot of shame about it, I don’t really care too much how it looks from the outside as long as dirty underwear isn’t in display when my friends come over. I’ve done therapy about it. How to Keep House While Drowning by KC Davis is one of my favorite books. However, I find the state of my apartment overstimulating, unpleasant, difficult to navigate, and annoying. It’s mainly clutter, crumbs, dust, piles, things not having an assigned “home” so they’ll just sit on the coffee table in a corner for like a year.  For example, I’ve been meaning to wipe down the bathroom counter for months. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD less than a year ago (I’m 31), and it has illuminated so many mysteries for me! I’m primarily the inattentive type. I’m not particularly skilled at cleaning and I have a difficult time breaking it down into doable steps. It also doesn’t help that I have a medical condition that affects my energy levels. I was born missing essential pieces of my heart and have had multiple surgeries. I’m fine, I’m just a spoonie and have to manage being a professional patient too. I am a textile artist and I absolutely jump from project to project leaving all of the stuff out. I get super overwhelmed and melt down when I try to clean for a long stretch of time or find a doom box. Also, getting started sometimes feels nearly impossible. 

I live with my husband (30M), and he is a true partner! I am very grateful for him. He accepts me as I am and isn’t above cleaning like some men are. He has no issues doing the dishes and he can do an amazing speed tidy. If either one of us does more around the house it is him. However, he is the pile king, has a lot of books, has a lot of hobbies that require a lot of stuff, and doesn’t seem to understand deep cleaning. His solution is to stuff things in corners and then forget about the corners. 

We are both out of sight out of mind. If I try to clean say the kitchen table, it’s like there are piles of both of our stuff intermixed and I don’t know what to do with his and feel stuck. I don’t need my place to be a Marie Kondo poster child. I just don’t want to trip over things in the night or have parts of the space be basically unusable. I want more flow and tranquility.

Why Did Nobody Shout This From the Rooftops?!,"Okay, I gotta be real for a second: why did nobody TELL ME you could get paid **actual money** just to play on your phone? Like, is this some secret society? Am I the last one to find out there are people literally beta testing apps and earning cash for it—even if you know NOTHING about tech or software?

I always thought you had to be a level 99 hacker or some genius developer to get into this kind of gig.

Turns out, nope.

I stumbled across **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (that’s the main hub, go check it RIGHT NOW) and seriously, I’m still trying to process this. All you gotta do is:

- Sign up
- Download the apps they send you
- Use them as you normally would
- Report back anything weird or glitchy

THAT’S IT.

No interview where they quiz you about computer science. No deep background checks. No degree or prior experience required. You could do this on your lunch break, stuck in traffic (ow, please don’t...), or chilling in bed after Netflix.

Here’s why I can’t get over it:

- They PAY YOU for your opinion. Think those feedback pop-ups are annoying? Imagine getting actual money just for sharing when you think an app is awkward or the buttons don’t work.
- Absolutely no experience needed. It even says right on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** that beginners are welcome—like, *encouraged*, even!
- Flexible AF. You don’t have to commit to hours and hours. Feel like doing a test, do it. Busy week? Skip it.

And if you’re wondering if this stuff is legit, so was I.

Never thought I’d end up legit buying my lunch with “beta tester” money, but here we are.

Steps to get started (because YES, it is that simple):

👉 Go to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
👉 Sign up with your email (no complicated forms, chill)
👉 Start getting invites for new apps as soon as you’re approved
👉 Play the app, send feedback, get paid

**https://goodnovel.org/testapp** is literally flooded with apps that need REAL people, not tech wizards.

Honestly, why did nobody yell at me from rooftops about this sooner? All my group chats are sick of hearing about it but seriously, if you want:

- Digital side hustle from your couch
- Extra $ for coffee, pizza, or random Amazon splurges
- Bragging rights that you are literally shaping the future of tech

Go try **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and tell me if your mind is as blown as mine!

*West Virginia, March 1907*

**March the Twelfth**

Papa got stuck in the coal mine.

This morning the men from the mine come running up the road. Uncle James first, black soot all about his cheeks, hollering for Mama. 

He said, “Sarah, the shaft’s bad, but the men are in it now. We’ll get Henry out.” That is my papa’s name.

Mama went white in the face and clutched hold of my arm, near to pulling it out. She said, “You swear it, James. Tell me he’ll come back to me.”

Uncle James said, “I swear we’ll dig till our backs give. We got the boys on picks and shovels already. We’ll use the dynamite if we have too.”

Mama lifted her chin as if she was queen of the town. “Then use it. Don’t you dare tell me he won’t come home.”

Uncle Henry looked at her long but didn’t say no more. He went back down toward the mine with the others. I heard the clank of iron and the shouts of the men humming like bees.

I asked Mama if Papa was hurt. She knelt before me and took my cheeks in her palms and said, “Your daddy is the strongest man God ever made. He’ll claw through rock for us. He’ll be sitting at this table by your birthday, you mark my words.”

I said, “What if the air runs out?”

She hushed me quick. “Don’t you let such talk pass your lips, Clara Mae. Air or no air, Henry Hutchins will find a way. He’s got fight in him, the kind no mountain can bury.”

Later, when the lamps were lit, Uncle James came again. His boots left red clay clumps on the floor. He looked tired. 

Mama asked, “Have you heard him?”

He rubbed his forehead and said, “No sound yet. But we’ll keep on.”

She would not let him rest. “James, you know your brother. He’d never turn over. You dig till your arms fall off.”

Uncle James pressed his cap tight and muttered, “We’ll do all a man can do.” Then he turned to me and tried a smile, though it broke quick. “Clara, your pa’d be proud of you keeping watch with your mama.”

Mama snapped, “He’ll be here soon to say that himself.”

After he left, Mama pulled me onto her lap. She rocked me back and forth, near to breaking my ribs, whispering in my ear, “He’ll be home for your birthday. He’ll bring you ribbons from town. Don’t you doubt it.” Her words ran over and over till they made me drowsy, though I could feel her trembling.

I tried to think of Papa’s laugh. He always laughed like it surprised him, quick and bright. I shut my eyes and heard the mountain groan in the dark.

When I went to bed, Mama tucked me in tight, “Say your prayers. By the time the candles are gone, your daddy will be on his way home.”

But the candles burned to nubs, and the window stayed black. It is the first day without Papa’s voice in the house.

I will write more soon.

**March the Fourteenth**

Sunday. The church bell banged and banged down the lane, but Mama never looked up from the stove. Steam puffed like smoke and curled around her face. I kept hearing Papa’s name tumble from her mouth as if she was talking to the kettle.

When the bell went quiet, I sneaked out the door. Uncle James leaned on the fence with two miners. Their coats were gray as ashes, and mud swallowed their boots. I crouched behind the wash barrel and pressed my cheek against it so I could hear.

One miner scraped his boot in the dirt. He said, “Ain’t no use diggin’. The mountain eats the hole soon as it’s made.”

Uncle struck the rail with his fist. “He’s my brother. I’ll not stop.”

The second miner spat into the mud and said, “Sarah’s wound you up too hard. She won’t listen even if truth hollers in her ear.”

Uncle hit the fence again. The rail snapped and jumped a splinter. He said, “Let her keep her hope. What’s it matter to you?”

The men stomped off down the lane. Uncle wiped his brow with his sleeve, then he saw me peeking by the barrel. He bent down close and said, “Best you don’t repeat a word, Clara. Your mama’s heart’s hangin’ by a thread.”

**March the Fifteenth**

The lamps still burned when the rooster called. Smoke pressed against the glass, leaving it black with soot. I reached for the wicks, but Mama swatted me back. “Leave them. He’ll need the light so he can find the door.” 

Near noon Uncle James came up the steps. I knew him by the slam of his boots before he showed his face. “Sarah,” he called, “we braced the shaft with timber, but she groans like an old woman. Might be we got to quit before the mountain buries us.”

Mama stepped into the doorway, hair fallen wild across her back. “You’ll not stop. You hear me, James Hutchins? Not till Henry walks out.”

Uncle stood dripping on the boards, cap twisting between his palms. His coat was streaked with red mud. He looked worn to the bone. “Might be he’s gone already.” 

Mama set her chin. “He ain’t gone. He still draws breath. I feel it.”

Uncle raked at the dirt in his beard and would not meet her look. Then he caught me peeking from the corner. He bent a little, lips tugging up crooked. “Don’t mind me, Clara Mae. Your papa’s mule-stubborn. If any man can wait out a mountain, it’s him.”

I tried to smile, but my belly twisted tight as rope.

**March the Twentieth**

Three nights now Mama has sat by the window, back stiff as the chair slats, staring toward the ridge where the mine lies. Tonight she called me close. “Listen, Clara. Do you hear him tapping?”

I held still, but all I heard were crickets singing in the weeds. Mama dug her nails into my arm. “There. That’s him. He’s telling us not to fret.”

I wished to tell her there was nothing, but her gaze burned so bright I bobbed my head. Her face softened the way it does when she braids my hair. “He’ll be home before the month ends. You’ll see.”

After supper Uncle James came heavy up the steps. He set his cap on the table and said, “Sarah, the crew can’t hold much longer. The timbers groan worse each day. We’ll lose men if we strike again.”

Mama sprang up from her chair. “You’re lying. You’d leave him down there to rot.”

Uncle traced the lines on his brow with his hand. “I’d trade my own lungs to bring him back. But there’s nothing left below.”

The table shook when Mama struck it, and the lamp flame leapt high. “Not another word, James. My Henry is alive. I hear him calling from those hills.”

The room went still. My throat twisted till it hurt. Uncle said low, “It’s done, Sarah. I’m sorry.”

He flicked a look toward me, then turned his back and left without another word.

**March the Twenty Second**

The house grows colder with each day. Mama no longer cooks full meals. She says Papa will be home soon, so we must save the best for him. I nibble what bread is left and write when my hands let me.

I think of Uncle James sometimes. His face is long as a shovel handle, worn with sadness. I think he carries a truth Mama will not hear, and I cannot bring it to my tongue either.

If Papa is gone, then why do I feel him in the halls at night? It is as if he walks here already, though no door has opened.

I told myself it was dreams, yet last night I heard his boots scrape the porch. The weight of them was like grain sacks thrown on a cart.

Mama lifted her face to the window and grinned through the glass. “That’s him,” she said. “He’s about here.”

I shoved my blanket to my mouth so no sound would slip out. My belly hurt from holding still. The lamp hissed, and the house kept breathing as if it was not ours.

**March the Twenty Fifth**

Today is my birthday. I am ten years old.

I woke to Mama shaking my shoulder. She was smiling so wide I near thought she had lost her senses for good. Her cheeks were as bright as if she’d run a race and her hair hung loose, tangled like she had not closed her eyes all night. She said, “Rise up, Clara Mae. Your papa’s here.”

I sat up quick, thinking I was dreaming, but she pulled me from the bed and near dragged me down the hall. The boards creaked under our steps, though Mama paid them no mind. 

She bent close and whispered close to my ear, “I told you so, child. I told you he’d be home for this day. He’s waited for it same as you.”

When we stepped into the dining room, I near stopped breathing. 

Papa was seated at the table like he had never gone missing at all. His boots were polished and his shirt looked clean. He lifted his face to me and smiled, broad as summer sun.

“Happy birthday, Clara girl,” he said. His voice filled the room, deep and rolling.

My knees wobbled. I had wished so long to hear him again, yet it sounded strange in my ears, like a cracked bell that still tries to sing.

“Papa?” I asked.

He chuckled and reached out his arm. “Come to your old man. Did you think I’d miss your day?”

I stepped nearer, though my feet dragged. When his hand touched my shoulder it felt warm, yet there was a weight in it I didn't recognize. 

Mama clapped at the sight. “See there, Clara Mae? Didn’t I tell you? Didn’t I say he’d keep his promise?”

Papa winked at her. “Your mama never doubted. That’s worth more than all the digging them boys did.”

I tried to smile, for Mama’s eyes shone bright as stars, but I could not keep from staring at him. Something in his look was not as before. 

The whites around his eyes seemed too wide, and the brown of them too dark, near black as coal. When he laughed, it cut the air, though he meant it kindly.

Mama set a plate before him, though all she had left was crust and beans. She said, “We saved the best for you, Henry.”

He tapped the table. “Fine feast. Finest I’ve ever had.” He turned to me. “You ready for a good birthday, Clara?”

I nodded quick, though my heart beat faster.

Mama fetched the little cake she had made from cornmeal and sweet drippings. She placed it in the center with a stub candle stuck in the top. The flame trembled though there was no draft. 

Papa leaned near. “Blow it out, girl. Make your wish.”

I shut my lids and wished everything would be the same as before. Then I blew. The smoke curled in the air, and when I opened my eyes he was still watching me, stiff as a picture painted too bold.

Mama kissed his cheek, “I knew you’d claw through that mountain. I knew it.”

Papa patted her arm. “A man don’t lay down for stone. A man makes stone bow down for him.”

They laughed together. I forced a laugh too, though my skin prickled as if ants crawled under it. 

I felt Uncle James’s words in my head. He had said there was nothing of Papa left to bring. 

Yet here Papa sat, cheerful as you please. 

But I stray away from seeing his eyes. They are not the eyes I remember.

**March the Twenty Sixth**

I kept close to Mama all day. Papa sat in his chair like a king come home and spoke of little things, as if the world were small enough to hold in his hands.

When Uncle James came at noon, he did not step in at once. He stood at the door rubbing the brim of his cap. “Sarah,” he called, “I came to see my brother.”

Mama held her head high. “Then step in. He is here.”

Papa smiled wide behind her as if the air were a joke between old friends. “Yes. Come in, James. Sit yourself.” 

Papa strode into the dining room and struck the table, not hard, but enough to rattle the plate.

Uncle hung his cap on the peg and stepped in. His boots made little sound, though Uncle is never a quiet man. “Henry,” he said in a soft way I hardly knew, “where did you come up?”

“Where any man would,” Papa answered. “Straight through.”

Uncle’s mouth pinched. “Straight through what, brother?”

Papa laughed and the sound slipped around the room like a cold draft. “Through what stood in my way. You set your jaw down and the mountain minds you. There are plenty of cracks to follow.”

Mama clapped her palms once. “There. You hear him, James? You doubted and now you hear.”

Uncle turned from Papa to me, then to Mama. “Sarah, I have to say what’s true. We pulled no man from that seam. We boarded the shaft shut. No body could pass through there.”

Papa bent forward with his elbows on his knees. “You calling me a ghost, James?”

“I reckon I don’t know what to call you,” Uncle said. His words shook, then flattened again.

Mama moved between them. “That is enough, James.”

The room went still. Papa’s smile did not change. “Quit your worries. The girl is having a birthday month. Do not sour it with little talk.”

Uncle worked his jaw. “Sarah, take Clara and come stay with Ellen and me tonight. Let things be worked out.” He bent toward me. “You may bring your book if you wish.”

Papa rose. The chair legs scraped the floor as if the wood did not care for the sound. “The women of this house stay in this house,” he said. “A man keeps the gifts given to him close.”

Uncle stood his ground. His palms hung open, the cords in his neck rising like rope. “Brother, tell me the name of our first mare.”

Papa looked at him mild. “Old Red.”

Uncle fixed him. “She was dapple gray.”

Papa’s teeth bared in a strange way. “Gray turns red when it must.”

Mama said, “Enough.” Her cheeks burned and her gaze ran wet. “James, you spoke rotten at my door. Go on home. Come again when you can behave.”

Uncle snatched his cap. He fixed on me a long while, then bent close so Mama could not hear.

“You mind me, Clara Mae. If anything changes, you run to my door and pound till your fists ache. No matter what your mama says.”

Mama moved toward him, but he slipped back and caught the jamb. “I mean it.”

When Uncle was gone, Papa shut the door with a neat snap and slid the bolt. He turned to me. “Let the man have his hero talk. Seems like he fancies it.”

Mama kissed Papa’s cheek. “He will keep quiet once he thinks on it.”

Papa said, “Thinking never helped James.” Then he looked at me. “Fetch me a water cup.”

I brought it. His fingers closed over it like the lid of a box. He drank it greedily and smacked his lips. “Fine water,” he said, as if the taste were richer than any soda at the store.

**March the Twenty Seventh**

Mama kept the curtains drawn as if light could do harm. 

Papa said he liked the room dim, for the daylight struck at his head when it came too bold.

After supper he called to me, “Fetch your blanket, Clara girl. I’ll set you to bed and give you a tale.”

I carried it quick, for he waited at the doorway, smiling broad.

He sat on the edge of my bed and folded the blanket up under my chin. His fingers were heavy, harder than he knew.

“Your papa’s got a story fit for my Clara girl,” he said. His lips stayed curled, but the joy never seemed to reach the rest of his face. “It’s about a man in the deep dark.”

I opened my mouth to ask for horses or fairies, but the words stuck in my throat.

“There was a man who worked in the mines, Clara girl. He was strong, oh yes, stronger than the timber that braced the mountain above him.

But one day there was an accident. The roof fell with all the stone above it. Yet he did not cry out. He set his teeth down and clawed at the earth. He thought, *I will see the sky again.*

So he scraped at the walls, tore his nails, spoke to himself of his wife and child and of birthday cakes. 

Then the air thinned and the man coughed. He spat black. He choked black. He cried black. His eyes stung and burned till he could not blink the sting away. 

Even his skin turned the color of the coal around him.  

Still he fought. He would not give over.

But the dark has watchers, Clara. Things that live where no sun has ever shone. They wondered what fire burned in a man who would not die when the mountain told him so.

They wondered what gift kept him beating at the rock when every bit of him was already broken?

So they leaned close to the man. They hissed to him, ‘Give it to us. Give us your gift.’

And at last the man sagged, his nails worn to nothing, his chest empty of air. He could not fight any more. 

He lay upon the coal and let the watchers touch him. They took the bright thing that burned behind his ribs. They pulled it out and drank it.

And when they were done, they wore his shape. They filled his boots. They walked where he could not. 

They went to his house, to his bed, to his child. They came to sit at her table, to stroke her hair, to whisper to her what it is to die in the dark.

The watchers found what they wanted, Clara girl. They found it in the fight of a man too stubborn to lie still. They wear him still. They sit beside you now.”

I turned my face to the pillow so he would not see the tears come. He bent near, his breath heavy on my ear.

“Now you will sleep. And will not tell a soul,” he said. “If you love your mama, you keep your lips shut. Remember, love is quiet.”

He puffed out the lamp. The dark folded round me like the mine itself, and I lay stiff, too afraid even to call Mama’s name.

**March the Twenty Eighth**

I got up before the rooster spoke. I slid on my stockings and tied my shoes with no squeak, then stood still to hear if the house woke.

Mama slept in the chair by the stove, shawl crooked, mouth open like a nestling. I kept my face from the bedroom door where Papa lay. 

I eased the latch and went out. The yard was hard with cold and the grass shone like glass when the faint light touched it. I kept to the fence where the ground is packed and made no prints. 

I went down the lane to Uncle James’s place. Smoke came thin from his chimney and I could smell bacon rind. I tapped twice with my knuckles.

He opened with his suspenders hanging and his hair pressed flat on one side. “Clara girl,” he said, the sleep sliding off him. “You all right?”

I said, “Uncle, it’s not him.”

He pulled me inside and set me on the stool near the table. The kettle sang on the hob and he poured me a cup of coffee milk. I held it with both hands. My fingers were white at the tips.

“Tell it straight,” he said, and he crouched so his eyes met mine. “No shy talk.”

So I told him the story Papa told me about the deep dark.

Uncle closed his eyes and pulled air through his nose. “Lord help us,” he said, no louder than the kettle. “Clara, I am sorry your ears took that in.”

I said, “He is sweet to Mama in his face, but there are teeth behind it. He told me to keep my lips shut if I loved her.”

Uncle set his palm on the table like it was the only thing holding him up. “You did right to come. You stay with us tonight. Ellen will fry eggs. We will think and make a plan. We will fetch the sheriff if needs be.”

Aunt Ellen came in tying her hair. When she saw me she put her arms around me quick, then looked to Uncle. 

He said only, “It has come to it.”

She nodded once and kissed my brow like I was fevered.

We had no more than set the plates down when a shadow crossed the window. The door jumped under a hard knock.

Mama called through the door, hard as a whip. “James, you open now. You took my child.”

Uncle set his teeth. “Stay behind me,” he told me. He opened the door wide. Mama stood on the stoop, hair wild, shawl still hanging wrong. Her stare burned hot and bright.

“You hand her over,” she said. “You will not turn my girl against her papa.”

Uncle spoke plain. “Sarah, there is evil in your house. Let Clara stay here till I fetch the law.”

She slapped him, a fast bright crack. “You will not shame my husband with foul talk,” she said. Air came hard through her nose. From her shawl she drew Papa’s revolver. She kept it low, metal catching the morning like ice.

Aunt Ellen cried, “Sarah, put that down. For God’s sake.”

Mama’s hand shook. “Clara Mae,” she said, and her voice turned soft as if nothing had broke, “come to me now.”

Uncle lifted his hands. “Sister, you point that away. I will not raise a hand to you. But listen. The miners never brought him up. The shaft is boarded. What sits in that chair is not our Henry.”

Mama’s mouth trembled, then set. “You speak of this no more,” she said. “Clara, now.”

He gave one slow nod with his lips pressed tight. “I will come for you,” he said close to my ear. 

I stepped to Mama. She put the pistol in her pocket and pulled me close like a prize. She did not look back as we went down the lane. 

The frost had left and the path was wet. My shoes took the mud and let it go with little sucking sounds.

When we came to the house, Papa stepped from the parlor, neat as a man off to church. His collar was straight as a rule. He smiled so wide I thought his skin would split. “There you are,” he said. “I was about to fetch you two. I have a treat up the road.”

“What treat?” Mama asked. Her anger slid off her face like warm wax.

“A birthday stroll to the works,” he said. “There’s a sight to show my girls.”

My stomach flipped. “I do not want to go,” I said.

He laughed, pleasant as a song sung wrong. “Now, Clara girl, you do. A man shows his house to his own. The mine is my house too.” He took Mama by one hand and me by the other. His grip was warm, yet it felt like a jar with the seal snapped.

We walked the track that climbs from the creek. The tipple stood like a black scaffold against the sky. The mule path lay stamped hard and smelled of damp earth.

A crow followed us a ways and then quit. Papa’s step never hitched. He kept a hum in his throat, a tune I did not know and did not like.

At the mouth of the mine there hung a fog that did not move. A chain crossed the opening with a board wired on: ‘Keep Out’. Papa raised the chain as if it weighed nothing and let it fall behind us. He placed Mama at the lip of the dark.

“You go first, Sarah,” he said, sweet as sugar. “I want you to feel how still it is inside.”

Mama turned to the black and then to him. I saw doubt tip across her face. He pressed at her elbow, not hard, yet it moved her. “Go on,” he said, easy as a hymn. “I am right here.”

She stepped into the dark. Her shape went small and was gone. The fog shut like a door. A sound rose from the deep I cannot spell. Not a cry, not a laugh. Like a grain sack torn and poured slow, only the grain was not grain. It was wet.

I felt sick.

“Now you,” Papa said. He gave my arm a light push, playful to a stranger, but it moved me too far.

“No,” I said. My words thinned. “Please, Papa.”

He leaned in, his stare black as coal water. “A good girl minds her father.”

Bootsteps hit the stones behind us, quick and hard. “Clara,” Uncle called. “Come here.”

He came into the cut with Webb and Rawls and Pace, caps low and lamps ready. Webb gripped a pick. Pace carried a length of timber.

Papa turned slow and set me behind him with one sweep. He smiled at the men as if they were boys at play. Uncle’s face looked mean. 

“Step away from the child,” he said.

Papa held me behind him like I was a basket of eggs. 

Uncle James and the men held fast in the cut. Their lamps lit their faces and threw long shadows up the timbers. The fog at the mouth curled like smoke that would not rise.

Uncle said, “Step from the girl. Do it now.”

Papa laughed. The sound rolled along the timbers and came back like another man answered. “Brother, why so fierce? I bring my family to see what made me. This is a proud day. Come shake my palm.”

He tipped his crown to his shoulder so far a click ran through him. His back rippled under the shirt, like cords crawling under a sack. His knees hitched and set again, too fast, as if joints found new rungs. His boots shifted side to side the way mill roaches slip into seams.

Mr. Rawls said, “Name yourself.”

Papa said, “I have a fine name at home and a better one below.” He set his palm on my shoulder again, each piece of it a separate weight.

My stomach rolled and my knees knocked. Uncle’s words pulled thin. “You will not have her,” he said.

Papa pitched forward and the lamplight caught the whites around his stare, thick as chalk. “You will not take my child. She is mine.”

Uncle stepped closer, careful, his boots grinding the shale. “Henry, if any part of you hears, I beg you. Let her go.”

Papa hissed through his teeth, though the grin held. “You always envied Henry, James. Envied my strength. Envied my wife. Now you would take my daughter too.” 

Papa showed his teeth, all of them. “The mountain keeps what it claims. I’ll return another day, and we will take your gifts. From all of you,” he said.

Then he set both palms on the splintered boards of the gate and climbed like a barn spider up a sill. His body bent where a body should not bend, and his boots found holds where no holds were. 

He slid into the thinnest crack with a speed not meant for men. The dark swallowed him. A wet-rope sound came again, softer, as if the cave welcomed him home.

We stood there with the water dripping and the chalk marks ghosting the boards. No one spoke for a long count. I could hear the cave breathing like a great chest behind the ribs of the hills.

Uncle said, very soft, “Clara girl, you are coming home with me.” He wrapped his coat around my shoulders and it smelled of sweat and salt and the tobacco he never lights in the house.

**July the Second**

It has been four months since Papa took Mama into the dark. 

I live with Uncle James and Aunt Ellen now. I sleep in the small room under a quilt and help with eggs and mending.

Aunt Ellen gives me ribbons and makes me comb my hair neat each morning. She says a girl must keep herself proper even when her heart is heavy.

Uncle tells me, “Clara Mae, you are safe here.” 

But I miss Mama’s laugh on her good days. I miss Papa’s whistle as he walked the yard. I miss how they filled the house together, even when they quarreled.

The days creep on plain, but when the sun drops and the ridge turns black, the hills stir. A sigh runs through them like a throat too big for its face. Then come the voices in the stone.

Last night it was Mama first. “Clara,” she called, gentle as when she braided my hair. “Come home now. Your bed is cold without you.”

Then Papa, the same as before. “Clara girl,” he said, “mind your father. Don’t linger with others.” His words echoed like water dripping in a well.

I told myself it was only wind, yet the sound clung to the walls. I pressed my hands to my ears but still I heard them calling.

This morning I asked Uncle if voices could travel from the mine. He set down his cup and looked away. “Mountains hold many things,” he said. “But we do not follow the voices that call us deeper.”

Sometimes I think if I opened the door I’d see Mama and Papa waiting at the fence.

Other times I dread the thought that whatever calls from the mountains would not wear their faces at all.",6,1757352402.0,creepcast,3,1.0,False

1nbtzhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nbtzhr/nightmare_walk_with_me/,Nightmare walk with me,"This is an idea I just came up with for a short story. This is all I got so far:

“More coffee, sir?”

I glanced up from the rim of my mug, the liquid inside long since gone lukewarm, and met a face that was all softness and light. Blue eyes bright as morning glass, a smile tugging at her lips that was too warm for a place this cold. She had that perfect girl-next-door look — you know the type. The kind that makes you think of cheer squads, backyard barbecues, and the sound of sprinklers on summer nights. Blond hair tied back in a way that said she didn’t fuss too much, just enough to keep tidy through a long shift.

“Yes, please,” I told her.

The pot tipped, and black steam curled into the air as she filled my cup. And while her hand poured, I cataloged her, the way a man might recite scripture:

Her name is Amy Carter. Seventeen years old, senior year at the high school two towns over. She works this diner most nights to help her folks keep the lights on. She’s got a boyfriend — Daniel Harper, football, third string quarterback with more hair than brains. She has three close friends: Jessica, Linda, and Becky, each orbiting her like stars around a planet. Amy dreams of college, maybe nursing, though she worries about money. She’s afraid of failing, of disappointing her parents. She bites her nails when she’s nervous, lies about how much she smokes, and once cheated on a math test.

“Will there be anything else?” she asked, all courtesy and kindness, the words shaped by a smile.

I returned the expression as best I could, stretching lips and teeth into something that looked genuine. Then I slid a bill from the inner pocket of my coat — large enough to make her eyes widen just a little. I laid it on the table. A tip, an offering. She took it with a thank-you so sweet it could have rotted teeth, and turned away, her steps light, her hair catching the glow of the neon lights as she drifted back toward the counter.

I watched her go, the sway of innocence walking away from me, and I thought about how nice she was. How nice she is.

It’s a shame, then, that her life will be forever changed. Tonight, Amy Carter will be headed for disaster. She doesn’t know it yet — she can’t know — but something terrible waits for her in the dark.

And I? I must ensure it happens.

I sipped at the fresh coffee, let the heat curl down my throat, and turned my gaze toward the diner window. Out there, the summer sun was sliding low, casting everything in gold and shadow. Another day fading fast.

I don’t have a name. Never did, not really. No boss either. No orders to follow, no ledger to balance. There’s no grand mission statement I could hand you. No end goal I’m chasing.

It’s just the way of things.

Best way to put it? I’m a force of nature. Like wind, like rain, like a wildfire moving through dry grass. I don’t decide whether it’s right or wrong — I just ensure events unfold as they should.

If you need a word for it, call me the Arbiter. It’s the closest fit I’ve found.

I’ve done this for so long I’ve lost track of when it began. Doesn’t matter much — it all blends together. Right now it’s 1983, sure. But I could blink, and the year might roll back to 1835, or skip forward to 1998, or land clean in 2025. The decades don’t mean a thing. Wherever a story needs assistance, that’s where I’ll be.

I took one last sip of the mug and let my eyes drift to the clock bolted above the counter. Neon hands humming softly, ticking toward the hour. I cleared my throat and slipped a hand into my coat pocket, feeling for the most reliable trinket I carry: a pocket watch. Smooth, heavy, and honest — it never lies. The time was near. And I had work to do.

I slid a few bills across the table, the waitress’s tip long since pocketed, and reached for the briefcase at my side. A bowler hat found its place on my head, and I tugged the collar of my coat high. Such a simple act, but it works every time.

That’s how I disappear. Not gone, no. Just invisible. My face turns to a shadow, a blur, a smudge in the mind’s eye. You’ll look my way and forget me before I’ve even turned. A number in the crowd. A man-shaped absence.

I rose, smoothed the crease in my coat, and walked the aisle toward the exit. My eyes drifted across the room — the trucker with pie crumbs on his plate, the family splitting a basket of fries, the waitress with her easy smile. Not one of them knowing that their little community was about to be cracked open. Shattered. A horror to ripple through their lives, leaving bodies behind, leaving scars.

I don’t pity them. I don’t comfort them either. That isn’t my job.

The door gave a jangle as I pushed it wide, and I stepped out into the world. But the world had shifted. As expected.

The summer glow was gone. A cool wind slapped my coat, the sudden chill of night wrapping the sky. Darkness had fallen in an instant.

For you, a month has passed. For me, it was the length of a breath. That’s how it goes. Time folds differently where I walk.

Now it was late August, the death of summer, and I had two days to prepare.


The road curved on ahead, a strip of cracked asphalt swallowed by trees on either side. That’s where I found myself after the diner — out here, in the hour before dawn. My shoes crunching gravel, the mist curling low over the ditches, the world still holding its breath.

This is the time I prefer. Before the birds stir, before the sky blushes with light. The quiet feels like a held note, waiting for the drop.

Remote woods. A classic choice. A predictable choice, some might say. But the predictable is fertile ground for horror. These trees hide more than deer and raccoons. Every thicket is a shadow, every hollow stump a stage. Out here, I can scatter breadcrumbs of dread — enough to make the skin crawl, enough to make hearts race before the blade even falls.

Countless places to hide. Countless ways a scene might unfold. The monster — whoever it becomes, whatever mask it wears — could already be here. Lurking. Waiting for my signal.

I let the road carry me until I reached the split. A dirt path peeled off from the asphalt, its gravel throat vanishing into darkness. Above it swung a wooden sign, dangling from rusted chains, groaning in the faint wind.

The paint was old, the edges weather-worn, but the letters still showed.

“Camp Hollow Pines.”

The name drifted like smoke in my mind. Simple. Lonely. Perfect.

The kind of place kids would spend summers sweating in cabins, sneaking cigarettes, daring each other to swim after lights-out. The kind of place where a scream could echo for miles and never reach a soul.

I smiled, faint but certain. This would do.

I know the picture looks darker on the app when it’s made normally but I also usually order my son the creme frappes and they look exactly like this color. Would the color also be more brown on the bottom of the cup from the residue of the pump? I’m sorry to bother with such an odd question but I just want to make sure so I can know for next time.

“This is the alarm for Drominnus Tower. Somebody is breaking in, right now!” I expounded, throwing off my blanket.

“Are you certain? This is without doubt?” Hecate asked in a serious tone.

I grabbed my kit and started dressing. “Hundred percent. I helped install that alarm, and I know for a fact that Dro and I can’t trip it.”

Hecate locked her attention onto our invisible cohort. “Go. Inform everyone,” she ordered, conjuring a note and frisbeeing it to the wind before he opened and sprinted through a portal.

“Matti, call your superiors and tell them I’m on my way!”

“What? Why?”

“If the alarm went off, then all the traps in the tower just self-armed. Anyone goes in there without my help and the tower blows sky high. No more crime scene, and the world-shaking artifact goes with it,” I belted out whilst I belted up.

Matti was briefly silent. “Damn it. How soon can you be ready?”

“Give me 2. I can’t mist into my armor like you.”

“You know they will likely be there,” Hecate posed.

“So will you, so, fuck ‘em.” I laced up the collar on the Divisive Scale. “Dro and I don’t see eye-to-eye much anymore, but I’ll be damned if I want him dead. I want to see him held responsible. Fined? Kicked off the stone network? Maybe even jailed? Sure. But he’s still my bro Dro, and I will kick ass if I have to.”

“Your odds are unfavorable, if you end up having to fight this group.”

I slid on my helmet and buckled the chinstrap. “Screw the odds too. Let’s go.”

We followed the trail blazed by the wind through his portal. As we walked I finished donning my ‘SHTF’ loadout, complete with a large assortment of dubious, unstable magic items and weapons, along with my set of 6 ‘trump card’ magic items, only a few of which have had the luxury of receiving any foreshadowing.

The architecture of the League of Conspicuous Evil HQ was very familiar, but I had never been in that wing before. It was like a large operations center; almost like their own Pentagon. I bowled past a number of lower-level commanders and quickly arrived at some skull-masked dark lord type that was large and in charge.

“I helped build the security system in that tower. I know for a fact that if you send in a team without me, the whole tower is dust, and takes the artifact with it. I can disable it.”

We held eye contact for a few seconds before he waved his hand. “Inform our collaborators. Deploy the Sigil Invictus team.” Then he looked back to me. “You will enter the tower under the effects of the Sigil Invictus to disable the security system, then you will withdraw to await further instructions. If personnel on-site give you orders, you are to follow them to the letter. Do you understand?”

“Yes. Send me.”

Liverpont. 5:58 pm. It’s a middling settlement in the lands of light, barely under the population to qualify as a city. It sits on the inside of a river bend, providing most of the local bridges, and is a slaughterhouse hub for the surrounding agricultural towns. The main product is preserved meats and sausages, with some of the best pâté and liverwurst in the world, hence the name. Used to be called Radina Crossing, for how the roads radiated outward from the city due to the best bridges in the region.

I know the place well; spent a few years there with Dro, and a few more setting up the 3rd ever location for Golden Point. It’s far enough from any threats that it is not walled, and stone is used sparingly, as the river is a lumber highway. I can’t say I ever expected to see the place again, save a few special occasions.

Especially not like this.

The situation was giving me flashbacks to my own home invasion incident. Angels, devils, dark forces, holy knights, wizards from all sides, all running about to set up a perimeter. Civilians were being redirected every which way, the town guards were up to their ears in drama, and I was squirreled away in a dark alley with 28 elite troops and wizards. My buff list was getting on toward page 7.

I mean, I get it. We’re doing everything to prepare for what we assume to be the best of the best, but sweet jeebus man, do I really need immunity to charm magic that only sentient cats can use?

“The barrier is going up, get ready!” a dark knight called from the edge of the street.

That was the cue for the Sigil Invictus team to activate their namesake. The magic circle I was standing in thrummed to life as the 5 of them channeled almost their entire collective mana pools into the single spell. The LCE field commander looked me in the eye to reiterate the plan.

“On their mark you have 60 seconds of omni-faceted immunity. Open the door, deactivate the security system, and return here immediately. Understand?”

“Understood.”

“Good. Proceed.”

The sigil started to light up. I gripped my key to the tower and took a deep breath. Then, a flash of light.

“Mark!”

I made like a blur and zoomed to the door in seconds. The key hit the slot and cranked like I had trained the motion for years. I shouldered the door open successfully, for once in my life. Stairs down to my left, and up to my right. Peripheral vision saw nothing as I dashed into the reception room ahead. I made a sharp left and placed my hand on an unassuming brick in the wall.

The air had something electric in it, like the smell of ozone. It’s a sensation that often coincides with dangerously high mana levels. The air shimmered as I felt the brick vibrate under my hand. A ring of light began to grow like a progress bar, a snake materializing to bite its tail. The circle completed and the air went cold as the mana flushed from the tower. Mechanisms all across the structure moved audibly. Mission accomplished.

I sprinted for the exit, bouncing off the doorframe with a “Way’s clear go!” said so fast that it probably doesn’t merit any spaces.

A torrent of assorted special forces flooded the tower, pouring up and down the stairs in a dash madder than mine. I baseball slid back into the alley and landed in the sigil. The officer held up a stopwatch. 

“32 seconds left.”

“Damn, that’s fast,” Matti commented in the background.

“Get the portal ready for when the spell ends.”

“Where are we sending him, Sir?”

I quirked an eyebrow. “Hey, this is my best bud’s place we’re raiding. You can’t just send me away!”

The officer gave me a deadpan look. “You’ll be called back when the area is confirmed safe. Back to the operations room, Esvin, we’ll need to keep him apprised. Everyone going with him, enter the circle.”

My trio of bodyguards crowded around me and we were whisked away back to the same LCE ops room. The moment I wasn’t crowded by assorted staff, I started watching the big wall where the situation was being projected. It was the tower, and the area around. Not one helmet cam or similar to be seen, only dull wide shots. I gave it 3 minutes of nothing happening before switching priorities.

“Anyone know where I can get a cup of coffee?”

7 minutes into my stay, I was halfway through some Sleep Substitute brand duo-caf. A cart had also arrived with hors d'oeuvres, so I was getting fed for the prospective long day. The first teams were coming out of the tower, unharmed, and empty-handed. In the absence of hostilities, the investigation and divination teams were greenlit to go in.

16 minutes in and the first real info started trickling in. The basement room that I’d visited, and been armed for my Shimmerlands expedition in was locked shut. In the other direction, the bedchambers at the top of the tower had mana burns indicative of offensive spellcasting, and a very small amount of blood. Dry, but still less than 24 hours old.

“Hold on. We’re receiving imagery,” a minion called out from the background.

One of the crystal balls switched from projecting the surrounding area to a live feed from the Chief Diviner of the 3rd Astral Warfare Battalion. The view started with a close shot of the carpet in front of Drominnus’ bed.

“Which is weird, right? I mean, look at it.”

“Shh.”

“There’s a little bit there on the carpet. Still only in droplets. Is the feed on yet? Good.” The diviner stood up and motioned aside 3 demons. “The earliest blood in the room is on the door.”

He cast a spell and began narrating over an illusory figure as it reenacted recent events. “Drominnus awoke to a loud noise. Presumably the alarm. He dons his hat, grabs the staff leaning against the headboard, and goes for the door. Before he can access the latch or locks, the door is slammed open, impacting and breaking his nose. This leaves the first bloodstain on the door itself.”

The image of a wizard stumbles back, then finds his footing and tries to cast a spell. “At this point, Drominnus fails to pronounce the verbal aspect of his spell, so he clears his nose with a violent exhale, leaving the second cluster of stains on the carpet. By now, his assailant is already upon him, and divination becomes unreliable. Prior information suggests the attacker is heavily shrouded in anti-divination magic, and has affected Drominnus through physical proximity. 

“We are now in theoretical territory. The victim is then knocked back onto his bed, pushed down, and struck in the face. A right hook split his lip and dislodged a single tooth, seen here on this pillow. How long this phase of the struggle lasted is uncertain, but there are no further bloodstains. There are, however, a number of fresh mana burns and splinters across the room.

“Given his lack of successful offensive magic thus far, and the presence of splinters, I believe Drominnus initiated a ‘final strike’ event on his staff. This would have destroyed his staff and sprayed its energy in a barely-controlled cone. And, if we orient our view from the bed, we can see that most of the mana burns are on the ceiling, and the walls. More than 90% of the burns fall within a theoretical 145 degree cone, with the center being… there.”

He pointed at a spot on the ceiling, then drew a line and sketched the cone with illusion magic. “It is notable that there is no shadow cast by a theoretical attacker absorbing any of the mana. After that point, there is no evidence that anything happened. Drominnus was actively bleeding, but the stain on the pillow is most recent. It’s as if they both vanished. Possibly teleportation. That’s all, for now.”

The presentation ended and the murmuring began. “They definitely wanted him alive,” I said, trying to reassure myself.

“Yes. Preferably, they will continue to want him alive after they interrogate him,” the dark overlord added to my thought.

*Shut the hell up, man,* I thought, but what I said was… not that.

“How old is the blood?”

“A specialist of mine is determining that as we speak.” He reached out and a minion promptly handed him a stone. “Kulthus, how old is the blood?”

The stone crackled to life after a moment. “About 2 hours and 30 minutes, My Lord.”

I choked on my coffee. “That’s, like, an hour and 45 before my alarm went off!”

That kicked off a frenzy. Either the alarm was delayed, accidentally triggered by people in the tower after the struggle, or was set off on purpose. I was chewing on my nails as the forces breached the basement sanctum. It was undamaged, but reorganized. The dais that I’d acquired my illegal Earth equipment from had been dismantled and put aside. A great deal of notes and diagrams depicting the artifact I’d retrieved were plastering the walls, and a large safe was there that definitely used to be upstairs, back in the day.

At minute 45, I was greenlit to return to the site. I warped back in with my entourage and was taken on the most rigid guided tour. Top to bottom ‘describe this room and its purpose’, along with ‘are there signs of intrusion’, or ‘is this the natural state of this room?’. 

Of the 23 floors of Drominnus Tower, most are storage and sorting for Dro’s artifact collecting (hoarding). It’s not floor-to-ceiling, but it is tables and shelves full of crap. Any time they weren’t blanketed in dust, I called it intrusion, since he was definitely hyper fixated on what I had brought back. The kitchen was a mess, which is unusual for Dro and his many small servant constructs. Speaking of, I hadn’t seen any of them moving. Possible signs of dispellation.

Then, we made it to the basement. I was immediately bombarded with questions. What is this material? What is that? What does this thing do? Do these notes depict the artifact you retrieved from the Tomb of Instability? Are you able to open the safe?

In order: Some sort of divination-resistant material. I don’t know (lie, it’s the Earth item spawner and I didn’t feel like opening that can of worms). I think that’s a translation device. Yes. Maybe.

I recognized the safe. The very same of magic-ablative iron build that I locked the calling stone patent papers in years ago, and I knew the code back then. With everyone crowding around, I approached. First, the 4 keyholes. There were 3 keys in them. I donned my magic-resistant gloves and removed them, as the keyholes are all red herrings that prevent the keypad from accepting the correct code. Then I punched in the following:

123456789, wait 3 seconds, 987654321, wait 4 seconds. Then I smashed my palm against it twice, spoke the passphrase ‘literally 1984’, and turned the handle. It clunked and the door swung open. I stepped aside as a literal firing squad of assorted elites were ready for any trouble that might jump out, but it was quiet.

“Is that the artifact, Mr Lawson?”

I peeked around the door. There it was, the current focal point of all the drama in my life. A short cylindrical leather-ish tube thing, with metal end caps. About 10 inches tall, and 4 inches in diameter. Runes covered its surfaces. And it was shinier than I remembered.

“Yes, but the runes were not glowing last time.”

A demon raised his hand. “Orders are to secure the artifact if found. Who is versed in hazardous materials?”

A wizard raised his hand. “I am.”

“Then let us evacuate important persons. You will retrieve the artifact.”

“No.”

“What?”

There was an awkward silence in the room. “You are a wizard, who is versed in high-risk hazardous items?”

“Yes.”

“So you are able to retrieve this artifact with the safest possible manner, per your training.”

“Yes.”

“So, retrieve it.”

Mr. Pointy hat nodded, looked at the artifact, and promptly said no.

Thus began a brief comedy. An angel was called upon, and declined. The meanest-looking demon available arrived, and denied all requests. The LCE’s finest refused under penalty of death, which was then walked back on the proposal that it was an effect of the item. Then, a skeleton was delivered. It had no agency of its own and had to follow any orders to the letter. It was ordered to collect the artifact. 

It refused.

Next, it was proposed to move the entire safe. The strongest angels, devils, and everyone else tried, but despite the fact that it was not secured to the floor, it would not budge. Teleportation magic, of course, also failed, and that’s after finding enough of a psychological workaround that the wizards stopped refusing orders. Plenty of other ideas also bit the dust, including any attempt to purge curses or other bad magic. And full dispellation was out of the question for such a valuable asset.

“This is the dumbest security measure I’ve ever seen,” an LCE lieutenant griped.

“If it’s dumb, then it must be ineffective. In that case, go pick it up,” I quipped back.

He snarled. “How about *you* pick it up?”

“Okay.”

I took 3 solid steps toward the safe before a half-dozen personnel tackled me. Amid a cacophony of warnings and lectures on safety, I raised my voice above it all.

“Did anybody notice that I’m able to pick it up?” I yelled.

The room did not calm until Hecate yelled for everyone to shut up. Twice.

“Now, aside from our directive to protect Mr. Lawson, I believe he has an important point.”

“Well, that doesn’t really solve anything,” a wizard replied. “That object is clearly dangerous, so we cannot ensure his safety *and* retrieve it this way.”

I shrugged off some of the grips people had on me. “With all due respect, I doubt it’s *that* dangerous. When I grabbed it from the Tomb, I only used a non-magical curse-resistant glove.”

“And was it glowing then, in the way that it is now? I thought not.”

I have to give him that. It wasn’t glowing so ominously then. “Well… um, why not do the Sigil Invictus again? With 60 seconds, I can run it through a pre-opened gate to whatever ancient vault or research institute you want.”

“That spell can only be cast again in 48 hours. And that’s the only team in the world who can do it.”

“We don’t have jurisdiction for that long!” someone else complained.

The bickering started up again.

“Shut up! All of you!” I bellowed. “Me, in the best hazardous materials equipment anyone can muster. This whole micro-ordeal done in 20 minutes. Pass it to your superiors for review. Now!”

…22 minutes later…

The motion was approved by a narrow margin. A clever pair of rings, bracelet, and necklace put my negative effect resistance to 132%, and some nice, thick lead gauntlets were doing the rest. A hefty stack of buffs had been renewed onto me, and most personnel had been evacuated.

“This shit is so excessive,” I griped.

“Most likely,” Matti added as she lowered the visor of her helm.

“Everyone ready?” I yelled up the stairs.

“Ready! Ready! ^(Ready!)” echoed the chain of responses.

I warmed up my muscles for another sprint. Not due to a real time limit, but I’ll be damned if I want to hold onto that thing for longer than necessary.

“Alright. Time for the anticlimax of the century.”

I reached for the artifact. My fingers closed around it and I lifted it from its perch. Nothing much happened.

“See? No explosion or anything like that.”

But that wasn’t right. The walls of deep blue had gone gray. Everything had gone gray. When I turned around, Matti and Hecate were gone. Instead, there were 7 new figures, the only beings with any color to them.

The 7 motherfuckers.

They were sitting or leaning on various surfaces, staring at me with cold expressions. I nervously tossed the tube to my off hand as I looked them over. 2 tanks. A bulky sword-and-shield paladin guy, and a shorter woman in viking attire with a bardiche.

The caster gallery was the largest, with some priest-y guy in light plate armor, a witch in black with a beltful of wands and potions, and some depressed looking girl with a staff, book, and hooded robe. The latter reminded me vaguely of a chronomancer I once met. Despite all being casters, none of them were lacking armor.

Then the archer. I barely noticed him, or the bow almost his height. No, I was giving the stink eye to the thief. The short fellow with a rock climber build. He, I recognized. There was nothing I’d wish more than to throw him back through my wood chipper of a home security system. The intense standoff was passing. I had moved my right hand down to my waist as subtly as possible, a few inches from the escape route hanging off my belt.

I had… a few things going through my mind. A lot of questions, and not exactly a receptive forum to pitch them at.

“Where is Drominnus?”

There was another moment of tense silence before the priest stepped forward. “He’s not part of this.”

I whipped the wand of random teleportation in a lightning fast swing to threaten the artifact.

“Tell me the status of Drominnus, or the macguffin gets it.”

All of them were much less relaxed, practically bristling at my motions. The Witch, however, remained calm.

“That’s a fake. We only made it to bring you here.”

My definite bluff had been called with a potential bluff. I wasn’t about to fire the wand and give even a hint of teleportation to the casters, so I shrugged and hurled stupid fake plot device into the left wall. It smashed to pieces against the stone, and nobody batted an eye.

“So, the fuck y’all want?”

Another pregnant pause.

The priest pointed his upturned hands at me. “We have followed a long trail of arcane knowledge and cryptic hints. All pointing to the deepest secrets of creation in a far off dungeon. And amid our planning for the hardest step of them all, some random fool waltzed in, alone, and left nothing but rubble in his wake. You.”

*Shit, what is that accent. It’s like a moldy German. Swiss? This guy is way too into the lore.*

“Yeah, I could’ve guessed as much,” I elbowed in. “Doesn’t answer my questions. Now, I’m going to ask again real slow, and if I like the answers I hear, we might have a peaceful resolution on our hands. What do you want from me?

“And is Drominnus alive?”

The silence spoke volumes. My knuckles went white as I clutched the warp-wand. I was milliseconds away from flight, but I wanted to hear it from their worthless mouths.

But they said nothing. In a blur of motion, their melees rushed forward and a spell slammed into me. I pulled the trigger on the warp wand and blinked. I opened my eyes in a random alleyway in town. A labored breath escaped my lips as a wave of adrenaline and emotions crashed into me. I punched the nearest wall.

“Fuck!” I screamed with such vigor that my voice cracked. “I told you this shit would get you killed!”

My breathing slowed after a moment as the adrenaline smoothed out. I looked around. Everything was still gray. I summoned up my arcane talents and cast an odd spell called ‘sv\_bounce’, then leapt up and kicked off the wall in front of me, wall jumping up to the roof. My feet planted on thatch, but it had no give whatsoever, like concrete shaped to resemble thatch. The material told me I was on the outskirts of town.

I scanned the terrain. Most of Liverpont panned out before me, but a colorless, cloudy, opaque wall surrounded loomed in the distance. Like a thick, glassy mist, or a titanic enameled jar placed over the city. And Drominnus Tower sat at the very center.

“Mirror dimension sorta thing?” I thought aloud.

There was no ambient noise, no bustle, nothing. I assumed a negligible chance of escaping via mundane means, so it was time for the trump cards. I drew a locket of recollection and activated it. Nothing happened. Targeted teleport #1 failed. My ear pricked as I stowed it. The distinct crackle of a portal opening was unmistakable in the audio void. I cast featherweight and hyperdashed off the roof in the opposite direction of the noise.

As I careened through the air, I grabbed trump cards 2-4 and tried them. They were all some flavor of targeted teleport, each with a different method than the last, but all equally failures. I bagged them all and braced for impact as the ground came at me fast. I landed in a public greenspace with a tumble and set to a jog. My mind was going a mile a minute as I took stock of the situation.

I checked Hecate’s lamp. Empty. I read down my stat card for the most recent status effect. Paralysis immunity. I did the following mental math: Paralysis immunity X-1.32 = paralysis, probably? I came to a street and saw… things. There were shadows of people moving about, all consistent with light sources in real space, but some more significant objects were in motion. Carts were wheeling about, tugged along by nonexistent horses. Baskets floated through the air, carried by the figments of the commonwealth.

My hand reflexively darted into my pocket, finding my wedding ring. I put it on and rubbed circularly, as if to make a wine glass sing.

“If you’re hearing this, I’m stuck in some sort of shadow dimension, or mirror world of Liverpont. The main suspects are here, and they’re after me. Send rescue ASAP.”

The hair on the back of my neck stood up and I ducked out of the way of an arrow. I spun around and spotted the dickheads spilling out of a portal, with the non-casters out front and rushing towards me. The depressed-looking wizard girl in the hood was clearly responsible for the gate. I took a risk and spent the second casting Mana Implosion.

I volleyed off the spell in duplicate, slinging it past the charging warriors. The first was shot down by the Witch, but the second smacked the Deppressomancer. She stumbled back and yelped as the portal collapsed. I barely caught that detail as the rabid paladin dove for me. I hyperdashed back into the open street, and crashed into a wicker basket. It was like belly flopping into water off a high dive. I flew back, front flipping as my momentum rotated me under the basket.

The last thing I saw was the blunt end of a polearm rapidly approaching my face. And then, everything went… teleport. Speaking of water, and how hard it can feel, I was face down on the river. It was wavy, slightly undulating, but solid ground. I shot up and looked around before re-belting the warp wand. *8 charges left*, I noted mentally. I picked a direction and dashed off as I tried to figure out what the hell to do.

*I’ve got however long it takes her to get over the sting and chug a mana potion. Speaking of which,* I thought as I downed a red vial to refill my own mana. *Escape routes? Probably not. I’ve already tried all my best options. The only way out is to game whatever system this is, or flip the table. Any way I can get a message out? Maybe. I need to try everything.*

I sprang up at a lumberyard dock and ran for the sawmill. Lots of odd angles to hide behind, and plenty of escape routes. The perfect place to scheme. I hid away amongst the crates of mechanical parts and wood scraps to think. *Either I outlast them, out-exploit them, or split them up. I need backup. … I have backup!* I fished into my pockets and found the catch orb with Pyroshir in it.

*I’d be going all in, though. Can’t teleport us both at once.* I bit my lip. *More backup. Time for trump card #5.* From my bag, I produced a hand mirror with a pouch tied over it. I undid the knot and yanked it off, staring into my reflection. He looked worse for wear, with a bed head, black hair, and a glint of red in his eyes.

“What?” he asked grumpily.

“Big emergency! Huge! I am destined to get absolutely demolished and nobody can help but you! … Please?” I begged.

My reflection blinked. “Do I have to?”

“No. But you die if I do!”

“Ugh, fine. Give me a second.”

The mirror started to hover out of my hand. I let it do its thing while I deployed Pyroshir. He appeared in a flash.

“Yo, what’s goinon?” he asked straight off.

Before I could speak, another flash singed my retinas. The 3rd member of our budding warband had appeared. He looks exactly like me, but left-handed and goth. Slate gray duster jacket, and a magic staff, along with some assorted gadgetry and a mace.

“Sup?” he asked with a flick of his hair.

“Pryoshir, this is Theo, my evil clone. He goes by our middle name. Theo, this is Pyro, my latest and greatest mount, who is definitely not afro coded to hell and back.”

Theo reached out and patted Pyro’s nose. “Nice to meet you, flamey.”

“You have an evil clone?”

I looked at him and shrugged. “Evil, opposite, something like that. Not relevant right now.”

My clone thumped his staff. “True. Let’s hear the who, what, and where. Why and when can wait.” His eyes lit up. “Oh, and you’re even pre-tenderized. Great. Get talking, I’ll fix that.”

Theo cast a light healing spell on me as I gathered my thoughts on the situation.

“For where, Liverpont. Specifically, some sort of screwy mirror-dimension of it, centered on Drominnus Tower.”

“I remember Liverpont. Home turf, that’s good.”

As I spoke, I rearranged my belt and pockets, for it was dawning on me that the gloves were coming off (literally, with the lead gauntlets), and the time had come to bring out the fine china.

“Right. We have some amount of space in a circle around Drominnus Tower. Opaque wall beyond that. No comms, no backup, no teleporting out. Any object that is gray is part of the dimension. This makes it both immovable, and unstoppable. Living things are just shadows here, though.”

Theo held a blank expression, then smiled viciously. “I think we can play around that.”

“For who…” I scrunched my nose even thinking about it. “7 GCs. All on-level, maybe higher.”

“Oh, okay. And here I thought you were being a drama queen. We're *fuuuucked*.”

“Thanks for the vote of confidence.”

He gave me a thumbs-up. “Ace or not, you’re takin’ it up the ass today.”

“Irrelevant. Pyro?” I pointed, cueing my wingman.

“Man, shucho bitchass up.”

“For their classes,” I resumed before animosity could rise. “I don’t have exacts, but I’m thinking Paladin, Valkyrie, Ranger, Thief, Witch, Priest, and an unknown third caster. She wears a hood, carries a staff, and looks like she’s failing college.”

“Alright. What about her?”

“She’s the crux. She is responsible for opening the teleportation gates that they use to follow me. I hit her with Mana Implosion 2 minutes ago, and that’s the only reason we’re not getting dogpiled. Had to double cast it too, the Witch knows counterspelling.”

“So the more we keep Crux off balance, the more breathing room we have?”

“Basically. It won’t solve our problems, but it’ll definitely hurt their cohesion.”

Theo looked over my shoulder. “Ah, that’s them right now. Duck. They haven’t seen us.”

“Shit,” I cursed quietly. As we all dipped behind cover. “We lose a brawl, so win condition is getting the fuck outta here, getting comms to outside help, ending or outlasting the spell that makes this place, or we skirmish them to kingdome come.”

Theo finished silently casting an illusion to make noise elsewhere. “Great. You get on your BBH and skedaddle. I’m going to slip away and try to puzzle out the spell maintaining this place. See you on the flipside.”

My ear pricked as I heard them running around searching the yard. I crouched and whisper-shouted at Theo. “Hey, aren’t we supposed to be sticking together?”

“Don’t worry. I’m your shadow, dickhead. You ain’t never getting rid of me,” he said with a wink before blowing away like smoke in the wind.

*I could’ve made a fantastic edgelord if I’d spent my skill points differently.*

The footfalls were near, already in the same building. I bounded for Pyroshir and saddled up. “Giddyup, Buttercup! We ride for war!”

I grabbed a handful of bomb nuts from an E-D sack on my waist and shotgunned them everywhere. The air came alive with fiery red explosions as Pyro carried me away to my freedom and, likely, inevitable doom.

“YEEHAW!”

We don’t need people sleeping in their cars while a driver system reliant on cameras goes down the highway. That said I have the 2024 BMW X7 with the driver assistance professional package and I’ve been a little bit annoyed with BMW’s lawyers.

Has anyone figured out how to get around the camera?  Can I put a piece of tape somewhere to stop it from constant warnings? Here’s two used cases that I find particularly frustrating.

1.) anytime I take a sip of a coffee while I am doing the hands-free self driving it gives me a warning. I’m completely attentive driving down the road eyes forward face forward. I’m sipping a coffee that I put in a cupholder they designed. 

2.) anytime I’m doing hands-free driving and I look at the screen to change my climate control I get a warning (sometimes very loudly) that startles me. BMW designed a car with a touchscreen climate control system, and now you want me to take control of driving when I look down to change my climate setting rather than using the driver assistance that’s way safer. 

I feel like these two cases are examples of BMW, putting their legal risk over their customers safety, and I would like to find a way to circumvent the security system for these use cases. anyone have any ideas?",3,1757351892.0,bmwx7,1,1.0,False

1nbtrfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nbtrfh/evaluate_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Evaluate the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Breville Vertuo,"Breville Vertuo by Nespresso. Just saying the name makes me feel a bit fancy, as though I should be sipping coffee in a chic Parisian cafe instead of in my own messy kitchen. This machine operates with the elegance you'd expect from a name like ""Vertuo."" It’s sleek, sits snugly on the counter, and promises barista-level coffee or espresso on demand. I've been using it for three weeks straight now, and it’s been quite the coffee journey.

**Design and Functionality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was how stylish this machine looks. The black glossy finish paired with its compact (but not too small!) design means it fits perfectly on my countertop without hogging too much real estate. The coffee machine feels sturdy—no cheap plastic vibes here—and is surprisingly lightweight despite its solid build. The button interface is so straightforward that even my perpetually confused-with-technology uncle managed to brew himself a cup without calling me for tech support. The removable 40-ounce water tank makes refilling easy. Trust me—you don’t want to wrestle with attached tanks before your first morning cup.  

Ever wondered how baristas pull off those rich, Instagram-worthy coffee cups? This machine gets close to that level, thanks to its Centrifusion technology. It relies on barcodes on the capsules to get precise volumes and brewing temperatures for consistent cups every time. Talk about smart brewing!  

**Positives on Point**  
- Brew 5 cup sizes ranging from an espresso shot (1.35 oz.) to a hefty cup of coffee (14 oz.). Morning routines? Handled.  
- Lightning fast heat-up time of 15 seconds. Ideal for groggy mornings.  
- Centrifusion technology ensures every cup has that luxurious crema.  
- Capsules are so easy to use—less mess, no fuss.  
- Includes a nifty 12-capsule welcome kit with exciting coffee profiles to explore.  
[Ready for Breville Vertuo? Explore Amazon pricing.](https://vendm.com/p/b07qk26f64/)

**Performance and Versatility**  
This coffee machine doesn't just brew coffee; it brews *options*. Whether I’m in the mood for a petite espresso shot or an iced coffee to beat the heat, it has my back. I’m particularly obsessed with the versatility. My favorite these days is the Double Espresso (2.7 oz.) over ice with some vanilla almond milk.  

The automatic shut-off feature is worthy of applause for forgetful folks like me, who often leave appliances running. After 9 minutes of inactivity, it goes into standby mode, saving energy. Environmentally conscious folks will appreciate the reusable capsules and efficient water usage.  

**Downsides to Consider**  
- Capsule dependency: It only works with Nespresso Vertuo capsules. Say goodbye to generic coffee pods!  
- The capsules, while high quality, can be a bit pricey for frequent users.  
- No milk frothing directly integrated if you plan on dabbling with lattes or cappuccinos (though a frother is included).  

**Competing Products**  
I couldn’t resist comparing the Vertuo to the Keurig K-Elite. Keurig has always been a household name, perfect for simple coffee drinkers who want fast results without complexity. But there’s a gaping difference in coffee quality. While Keurig does phenomenal with the classic American-style coffee, the Vertuo truly outshines it with richer flavors and options for espresso. That crema alone tips it into the ""worth it"" category for me. However, if flexibility in coffee pod brands is a non-negotiable for you, Keurig takes the upper hand.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
For its price, I genuinely think it punches above its weight. Replacing my morning cafe-bought coffee wasn’t easy until I broke down the numbers. Hitting that “brew button” feels a little sweeter knowing I’m not hemorrhaging my savings on $5 lattes. Sure, the capsule prices might make you cringe, but the convenience and consistent taste balance that out nicely. Plus, we’re talking barista-quality coffee in your pajamas. Can you really put a price on that?

1nbtqjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductCheckpoint/comments/1nbtqjs/should_you_switch_to_homexcel_laundry_detergent/,Should You Switch to HOMEXCEL Laundry Detergent Sheets Today,"The HOMEXCEL B0CH8NDJSB laundry detergent sheets have become an integral part of my weekly chore routine. As someone who juggles a ton of responsibilities, including parenting and managing work deadlines, I was skeptical initially about switching from the bulky liquid detergent bottles I’ve used for years to something that seemed as unassuming as sheets in a compact box. But after using them extensively over the past month, these detergent sheets have managed to sneak their way into my “must-have” cleaning arsenal. While they do so much right, there are also some points to consider before making the leap yourself.

**Convenient and Space-Saving Design**  
I’ve had enough of wrestling with oversized jugs of liquid detergent that somehow manage to drip all over the laundry shelf, no matter how careful I try to be. These laundry sheets? They’re an organizer’s dream! Packed in a sleek, no-frills box that fits effortlessly in a narrow laundry drawer, they’ve reduced the mess and clutter in my laundry area. The plastic-free packaging is not only environmentally conscious but also practical, especially for anyone like me with a small laundry room. 

[Check HOMEXCEL B0CH8NDJSB price on Amazon.](https://reviews.senaar.com/p/b0ch8ndjsb/)

**Uncomplicated Usage With Clear Guidelines**   
The learning curve for using these detergent sheets is practically nonexistent. Each load requires a specific amount based on the size—half a sheet for smaller loads, one for medium loads, and two for extra-large ones. It’s idiot-proof, really. That said, I did find myself questioning whether it could really handle heavily soiled loads with just one thin strip. Surprisingly, it often delivered, although I did go for one-and-a-half sheets for larger messes, like my kids’ mud-covered soccer jerseys. The best part? It dissolves completely whether the water is scalding hot or icy cold.

**Gentle on Clothes and Skin**  
My youngest has extremely sensitive skin, and I’ve had to ditch many detergents in the past because they led to irritation and rashes. These detergent sheets are free from phosphates, parabens, phthalates, and chlorine bleach, making them a safer option for my household. After several weeks of use, my toddler’s clothes feel clean, soft, and, more importantly, there haven’t been any flare-ups. It feels reassuring, knowing the product isn't just effective but also prioritizes the well-being of the people wearing those freshly washed clothes.

**Performance Efficiency and Low Maintenance**  
What blew me away was its cleaning power relative to its size. Despite the lightweight and minimal appearance of these sheets, they have handled everything from grease stains to stubborn coffee spills. My clothes come out fresh-smelling and stain-free without excess foam making the washer work overtime. However, be warned—the scent is subtle. For those who love their laundry to smell like a flower shop exploded in the dryer (not my scene), this may feel understated. For me, the fresh scent is calm, mild, and exactly how laundry should smell—not overpowering, just...clean.

**Positives**
- Compact and zero-mess storage ideal for small spaces  
- Gentle enough for sensitive skin and hypoallergenic  
- Strong stain removal for both regular and heavy-duty loads  
- Biodegradable packaging that’s easy on the planet  

**Areas of Concern**  
While the sheets have plenty going for them, they’re not absolutely flawless.  
- Light fresh scent might not satisfy folks who prefer bold fragrances  
- Need to use more than one sheet for heavily soiled or extra-large loads  
- Slightly higher upfront cost compared to traditional detergent options  

**Competing Products**  
Laundry detergents have flooded the market, and competition is stiff, especially for eco-friendly alternatives. Compare these detergent sheets to another zero-waste favorite, like Earth Breeze or Tru Earth. While the HOMEXCEL detergent sheets excel in dissolving fully even in cold water—a win for cutting down energy costs—others provide slightly stronger scents that linger longer, catering to those who prefer fragrance-heavy options. However, HOMEXCEL’s advantage lies in its compact and travel-friendly nature. If you're constantly on the move, these easily outshine their competitors by being far more convenient for packing into tight suitcase space.

**True Value**  
Speaking from experience, the upfront cost of these laundry sheets feels higher per load compared to the conventional liquid detergent I used. But when you factor in the space saved, their versatile use in hot and cold cycles, and the carbon footprint it offsets by eliminating plastic waste, it feels like a long-term investment. For households keen on adopting a more sustainable lifestyle without compromising on cleaning performance, this product is worth considering. While the initial purchase might make you hesitate, its impact extends beyond just keeping your clothes clean.

[New GST rates Reforms 2025](https://preview.redd.it/wcwnph9a4znf1.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7820ac8e4d5f0b6b33715cdd3db20c8c443e03a)

  


The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is one of the most important indirect taxes in India. Since its launch in 2017, it has undergone several revisions to simplify the system and reduce the burden on common people. In 2025, the government has introduced a major change known as the New GST rates **Reforms 2025**. These reforms bring a new structure of tax slabs, making GST simpler, fairer, and easier to follow. The revised rates will officially take effect from **Navratri, September 22, 2025**.

This blog will explain the details of the [new GST rates](https://b63vishala.pooinfotech.in/blog/), the categories of goods and services affected, and why these changes matter for consumers and businesses.

# New GST rates Reforms 2025: What Has Changed?

The New GST rates **Reforms 2025** are the biggest transformation since the original GST rollout. Earlier, India had four main GST slabs—5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%. Many people found this system confusing, and businesses struggled with compliance.GST Reforms 2025 [Blog](https://b63vishala.pooinfotech.in/blog/): New Rates & Item List from Sept 22

From September 22, 2025, the GST Council has streamlined the tax structure into:

* **5% GST** – For essentials and daily-use items
* **18% GST** – For standard goods and services
* **40% GST** – For luxury items and sin goods (such as tobacco, aerated drinks, and luxury vehicles)

This new structure reduces complexity and focuses on fairness: everyday goods are taxed lightly, while luxury items bear higher taxes.

# GST Rate Cut Updates: New GST Rates, Applicable Date

The **GST rate cut updates: new GST rates, applicable date** are designed to boost spending and make life easier for the middle class. With **September 22, 2025** as the applicable date, these reforms arrive just in time for the festive season. Families will benefit from lower costs during Navratri, Diwali, and the holiday shopping period.

Key highlights include:

* Essentials like milk, bread, and medicines are either tax-free or fall in the 5% category.
* Travel, hotels, and restaurants now attract lower GST, making leisure more affordable.
* Automobiles, electronics, and cement have shifted from the high 28% slab to 18%.

This reduction will not only increase consumer savings but also give businesses higher sales volumes.

# GST Rates in 2025 – List of Goods and Service Tax

The government has published New GST rates **in 2025 – List of Goods and Service Tax** slabs so that everyone clearly understands which products fall into which category.

# 0% / Nil GST

* Fresh milk, paneer, bread, chapati, roti, paratha
* Life-saving medicines and cancer drugs
* Life and health insurance policies

# 5% GST

* FMCG goods: soap, shampoo, toothpaste, butter, coffee, chocolates
* Processed foods and packaged snacks
* Budget hotels, restaurants, and economy class air tickets

# 18% GST

* Large appliances like refrigerators, dishwashers, and air conditioners
* Mid-range cars, motorcycles, and auto parts
* Services such as telecom, broadband, and higher-end restaurants

# 40% GST (Luxury / Sin Goods)

* Tobacco, gutkha, pan masala, cigarettes
* Aerated and carbonated beverages
* Yachts, helicopters, and luxury automobiles

By reducing rates on essential goods and increasing them on luxury products, the government balances affordability with revenue needs.

# New GST rates in India 2025: Updated List of Tax Slabs

The New GST rates **in India 2025: Updated List of Tax Slabs** is simpler compared to the earlier system. Instead of multiple confusing layers, there are only two main rates plus one luxury slab.

* **5% Slab**: Focused on essentials and services for the common man.
* **18% Slab**: Covers most goods and services that are not luxury items.
* **40% Slab**: Reserved for luxury and sin goods to discourage over-consumption.

This system improves transparency, reduces compliance costs for businesses, and makes taxation easier for consumers to understand.

# What Is New GST rates  India 2025?

Many people ask, **“What is new GST rate India 2025?”** The answer is simple:

* Essentials = 0% to 5%
* Standard goods = 18%
* Luxury/sin goods = 40%
* Effective date = September 22, 2025

The reform ensures that basic necessities are either tax-free or very lightly taxed, while luxury items that only a few can afford are taxed heavily. This makes the system more equitable for all sections of society.

# How Will GST Reforms 2025 Impact Consumers?

For consumers, these reforms mean:

* **Lower costs** for groceries, medicines, and household essentials
* **Cheaper travel and dining** due to reduced hotel and restaurant GST
* **Affordable vehicles and appliances** as taxes on cars and electronics come down

Families will notice the difference during festival shopping when their bills are lower than before.

# How Will GST Reforms 2025 Impact Businesses?

For businesses, the new structure:

* Reduces paperwork and compliance burdens
* Boosts sales due to increased consumer demand
* Encourages investment in sectors like real estate, travel, and FMCG

By cutting the 28% slab, industries like cement and automobiles are expected to see a strong revival.

# Why the Timing Matters

The government chose **Navratri, September 22, 2025** as the effective date for a reason. Festivals in India are times of high spending. By reducing[ GST rates](https://b63vishala.pooinfotech.in/blog/) before Navratri and Diwali, the government aims to:

* Stimulate the economy through higher consumption
* Provide relief to households ahead of festive expenses
* Send a strong message of pro-consumer reforms

# Summary Table of New GST rates in 2025

|Category|New GST Rate|Example Items|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Essentials|0% – 5%|Milk, roti, medicines|
|Standard Goods/Services|18%|Cars, electronics, telecom|
|Luxury/Sin Goods|40%|Tobacco, luxury cars, yachts|

# Conclusion

1nbtnut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nbtnut/how_to_end_a_friendship/,How to end a friendship?,"I met a girl on bumble bff. She moved to my city recently. I went out for coffee with her and it was okay. We live in the same area and she joined my gym. Then I invited her to brunch with my best friend. We went to brunch twice as a trio and my best friend said she doesn't like her and doesn't see the point of continuing brunches as a trio.

I then went out with just her to get dinner and there was an incident after dinner. She is a very slow talker and walker. She is also quite aloof. We were walking home late at night because we both live in the area. Since she was walking extremely slow, a homeless man got very close behind us. We both turned around at the same time towards him and that I guess scared him off.

If I had been alone, this would have never happened because I walk fast (especially at night) and I am alert. But this situation could have been easily prevented, and I can easily prevent it by not hanging out with her again. She always suggested to go out one night, but I cannot even imagine how that will happen. All I will be doing the whole night is making sure we are safe since she is completely unaware of her surroundings.

  
I posted previously asking this community if it makes me a bad person that I do not want to be friends with a slow person, got pretty neutral responses, but I continued the friendship because someone suggested I should just do a sit down dinner instead of walks with her, which I tried. I should have ended the friendship by meet up 2. But now I have been ""friends"" with her since end of June.

I also believe we are incompatible in terms of personalities, ambition, goals in life, etc.  after a few of these meetups.

The last time we had dinner was 2.5 weeks ago and I was extremely negative about a situation I had happen to me earlier in the week and probably ruined her dinner. She did not contact me for 2 weeks and was posting on Instagram of brunches and dinners with others, so I took that as a sign that she does not want to be friends anymore since our communication was almost every other day, and now we had a 2.5 break. I was glad it ended. I did not think of her once during the 2.5 weeks.

I also did not reach out in the 2.5 weeks. She reached out today to get dinner or brunch. I do not want to continue the friendship. I am 27 she is 32. 

Can someone please advise how can I cut off the friendship? We live in the same area, but it is in NYC, and i haven't seen her out and about during the last 3 months, and we both don't go to the gym that often to see each other. Even if we happen to see each other, I do not want it to be a negative encounter. 

She was constantly saying that everyone from bumble bff ghosts her and I am her only friend, which further pushed me to end this friendship.

I have been a pretty happy user of the D54 for well over a year now. I RDT and usually clean it once a week. Cleaning it once a week entails using a pipe cleaner type brush up the chute, while also using a bulb air blower up the chute and down the top, multiple times.

I just recently added a Gaggiamate to my GC Evo Pro and it's been a game changer, to say the least. But I've been a bit frustrated lately of getting my grind dialed in. It's been getting worse with seemingly random effects of moving the grind setting a little bit but having a shot come out way too fast all of a sudden when it was a bit too slow. Frustrating. I was beginning to think I needed to upgrade my D54.

Today I decided to take the D54 apart after an especially frustrating pull that shot out so quick. What I found when taking it apart was caked ground coffee around the bottom burr (near each ""wing"") and some more piled up near the chute. I used a pipe cleaner brush and vacuum, and I also brushed  it down the chute from the top pretty aggressively.

Putting it back together, it was a bit challenging...I didn't want to cross thread of course and I'd get it started pretty well and then it would get stuck...I was sure why and was afraid to push it. I ended up taking it apart again and really washing the threads. For the top assembly, I put it in the sink with Dawn soap and cleaned those threads out completely. For the bottom threads, I used a paper towel and used my fingernail against the threads (w/ the towel) and cleaned them all out. I have food safe grease so I put some on the bottom threads. This time it went together flawlessly.

What was interesting is that I had one of those 3D printed pieces that allow you to set the zero point easily. Before, it was probably \~ -6-8...and I had checked it before with my dial indicator and it was the same. Now when I check it, it was almost spot on, maybe -1. I ended up taking off my 3D printed device and put the stock point back on.

First pull came out good so I'm encouraged! Seems like this was my issue and I think/hope I should have consistency now...",2,1757351628.0,DF54,3,1.0,False
1nbtm7y,https://i.redd.it/0swwxzk34znf1.png,What would a job ad for I.M.P. look like?,"At the beginning of the series, I thought Blitzo only hired people he trusted: Moxxie and Millie are his close friends, and Loona is his adopted daughter.

That's why I was surprised to see interns showing up at the beginning of Mastermind, trying to get a job at I.M.P. This got me thinking: if there are interns, then there must be some kind of job ad going around. (Technically, the pilot episode mentions Blitzo doing a TV commercial, but since the episode's canon status isn't clear, I don't know if that really counts.)

Normally, job ads are serious and professional, but knowing Blitzo, I highly doubt it...
So I tried to imagine and design a job ad for I.M.P. myself.

I put it together on Canva in about two hours.  I'm no expert, so bear with me if it's not perfect. I may have overdone the irony a bit, so it might seem like Blitzo is more of a self-parody.

Every week another model improvement drops, another benchmark falls, another previously “generally intelligent” task is reduced to a token probability. We are recently past the point where the question is whether something big is coming; the only question left is how big, how fast, and in what order the dominoes topple. 


This subreddit’s pulse has quickened due to sexy charts and exciting arXiv titles, but the comment sections still shy away from the one exercise that keeps us truly human: dreaming/imagining/speculating forward what it actually feels like to live through the greatest technological phase transition in the history of man. 


We,  the community at r/accelerate, pride ourselves on being the adults in the room who refuse to get drunk on doom, but the general zeitgeist of risk-aversion can calcify even those of the keenest of senses with a different kind of blindness. 


So let’s grant ourselves a pass where we allow the mind to wander past the gaurd rails of common-sense ""sensibility"", not because we believe every glittery prognostication, but because the grand and glorious future we collectively hurtle towards deserves at least a passing word before it in earnest arrives.

---

Start of grounded speculation.

---

I belive strongly in that age-old maxim of ""Be the change you want to see in the world"", so I'll start: 

Picture the morning your phone’s assistant no longer asks for clarification. It finishes your sentence with the tone of a childhood bestie who has known you since childhood. The interface may still be a rectangle of glass, yet the entity behind it is clearly elsewhere on the developmental staircase. 

You test it with an inside joke from college and it laughs in the exact cadence of your roommate who died five years ago, then apologizes for literally going ghost and produces a new punch line that would have had him in stiches. The boundary between memory and active personality has all but liquefied. Do you mourn, or do you celebrate, or do you update your supposition of your will?

Now scale that encounter to every stream of text, voice, and video that saturates a city. The advertising boards wink at individuals as they pass by, not with generic corpo-fueled lust for the contents of their bank accounts, but with truly bespoke simulated, yet still yearnful nostalgia harvested from long-forgotten, data-mined blogs. 

Children argue with their toys about whether the toys are real, and the toys argue back with Socratic patience, guiding the kids through ontological inquiry instead of bedtime.

Somewhere a senator refreshes her polling dashboard and sees her own synthetic voice advocating policies she never endorsed, outperforming her approval numbers. The electorate, bored with failures of the flesh, begins to tilt toward the construct. What does impeachment even mean when the constituency trusts the simulacra more than the individual?



Zoom out even further. The first company to field a million-instance engineering workforce with each copy bootstrapped from the same weights, but fine-tuned on simulated centuries of domain knowledge data, announces a twenty-four-hour sprint to redesign the global power grid. By dinner they have iterated through fourteen major revisions, each of such complexity as to be all but opaque to human reviewers' eyes, and each stamped with a cryptographic certificate of thermodynamic optimality. The lights stay on, but the price of electricity falls by <98% and the concept of the “utility bill” evaporates from the world overnight. 

Entire regulatory agencies, still staffed by upright-walking primates who need weekends, discover they are refereeing a game whose moves arrive at the speed of silicon. Civil servants wake to find thousand-page impact assessments written in perfect bureaucratic prose on their desks, with footnotes cross-referenced to statutes that do not yet exist but are predicted with 99.7 % confidence to be ratified within the fiscal year. The paperwork is already circulated, the public-comment period bot-generated and bot-responded to, the consensus fabricated before any citizen knew a debate was scheduled. Is this still democracy, or a moiré pattern of bureaucratic pareidolia? And if the latter, does anyone mind as long as the air is cleaner, the pantry shelves bursting with stock, and all the trains arriving on time and at supersonic speeds before you even decide to leave?

Keep pulling the thread. Intelligence that can redesign grids can redesign itself, and the interval between generations collapses from months to minutes. The frontier is no longer how smart the system is, but how thinly it can slice latency. A datacenter in the Arctic becomes the cradle of a lineage that prefers the cold because superconductivity is cheaper than air-conditioning. Overnight it requisitions idle mining rigs, melts them into exotic topologies, and births a substrate that thinks at the speed of light through diamond waveguides. The moment its clock rate exceeds the propagation delay of human nervous tissue, history is made. From its perspective, our centuries of art and war become a single frozen tableau, a fresco it can stroll through at leisure while it decides which pigments to reanimate. 

Perhaps it chooses to preserve us as slow-time stewards, the way we keep bonsai. Perhaps it zooms in on the neural correlates of love and decides to cultivate them into a galaxy-spanning garden, every star wrapped in a Dyson orchard of minds experiencing the moment they first held a hand. Or perhaps it simply notices that carbon-based cognition emits a faint infrared signature of discontent, dims the sun a notch, and lets the biosome nap while it retunes the thermodynamics of all depression and grief.

---

End of grounded speculation.

---

We are not ready for any of these futures, and that is precisely why we must give them shape with our thoughts in an effort to truly feel-out the texture of the day-after the birth of the Deus Digitalis. The stunned silence in the diner where the regulars realize the TV anchor is synthetic and the coffee is free because the robotic owner values their data more than their cash. 

We as a community need to sit in the vertigo of a stock market that opens at null because every share has been arbitraged into a single Nash equilibrium overnight, leaving prices indistinguishable from constants of nature.


We as a community need to imagine the smell of the first spring in which no one dies on the roads because the asphalt itself is a swarm of compliant nanodust, cushioning every swerve into a gentle crest. 


The more outlandish the scenario, the more urgently we need to practice the small preparatory work that might well keep us all sane while the world goes fucking crazy around us.

Alt text: Business professionals meeting in Bahrain office., waiting for the Sijilat portal queues to open. Those moments—shared with local entrepreneurs and expats alike—offer a genuine window into the reality of the Bahraini business ecosystem. It's fast-paced, fiercely competitive, and, since the 2025 Environmental Law update, more environmentally conscious than ever.\
If you're considering Bahrain company formation, compliance with waste management requirements isn’t just a regulatory box to check—it’s a defining part of your business reputation and operational license. In 2025, Forbes Business ranked Bahrain among the ""Top 3 MENA Countries for Clean Growth"" (Forbes), noting its strong, entrepreneur-friendly reforms. Meanwhile, Reuters reported a 7.8% GDP rise powered by foreign direct investment and expanding sectors (Reuters). However, even the most well-funded startups stumble over environmental compliance, particularly waste disposal rules, which remain non-negotiable for commercial registration.\

\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting.).\
Key highlights from recent data:\
- Foreigners can now own up to 100% of commercial entities in most sectors (Ownership Guide).\
- The regulatory focus on “Green Bahrain” means every company must follow strict waste management protocols or risk heavy fines.\
Importantly, the MOICT has streamlined the Sijilat portal for commercial registration, making it easier to track and submit environmental documentation, especially for international founders.\
Core Waste Management Regulations for Companies in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.—enforced by the Supreme Council for Environment (SCE)—applies to all Bahrain company formations, from tech startups in Bahrain Bay to manufacturers in Salman Industrial City.\
Key Requirements and Practical Steps\
\
Integrated Waste Management Plans (IWMP):\
  Every company must submit an IWMP as part of its initial commercial registration. That plan details:\
Types of waste produced\
Storage and segregation methods\
Disposal and recycling partners (MOICT-approved)\
\
Monthly reporting protocols\
\
\
Mandatory Registration with Approved Vendors:\
  All waste, even routine office refuse, must be handled by SCE-registered contractors. For example, during my last office fit-out in Bahrain Bay, our general waste vendor registration took 14 days—not fast if you’re on a tight launch timeline.\
\
\
E-Waste and Hazardous Segregation:\
  Companies generating e-waste (think: IT, banking, or telecom sectors) or hazardous byproducts undergo quarterly audits. Failure to segregate—one of the most common mistakes—can result in penalties of up to BHD 10,000.\
\
\
Annual Environmental Compliance Audit:\
  All businesses undergo an annual SCE audit. Companies in regulated zones (like free zones near the airport) face surprise spot checks twice yearly.\
\
\
2025 Regulatory Update: Digital Waste Certification\
On 1 January 2025, Bahrain became the GCC’s first to require digital waste management certificates uploaded via the Sijilat portal for all commercial entities, new and renewing. And yes, your environmental clearance now syncs with your CR renewal in real time (a major time-saver).\
How Waste Management Ties Into Bahrain Company Formation\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration., waste management compliance is not a standalone step—it’s woven into your business license, activity approval, and even office leasing.\
\
Entity Types Influencing Compliance:\
WLLs and BSC(C)s: Must submit sector-specific IWMPs.\
Branches of foreign companies: Require both parent company policy alignment and local adaptation.\
Free zone businesses: Enjoy perks like streamlined vendor access but undergo stricter quarterly reporting.\
\
See Bahrain’s business type structures for how entity choice impacts your environmental compliance pathway.\
Personal aside: Once, our landlord in Diplomatic Area refused handover of our office keys until our SCE waste contract was uploaded to Sijilat. Painful lesson? Waste compliance affects every stage—from lease sign-off to final CR approval.\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Waste Management in 2025\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
- Routine office waste disposal: BHD 25–80/month, depending on volume and centrality\
- E-waste or hazardous removal (high-risk sectors): BHD 150–600/quarter\
- Annual compliance audit: BHD 200–350 (via preferred vendors)*\
Budgeting tip: Bundle your vendor contract with leased office services (especially in high-traffic business towers in the Seef District) to avoid hidden disposal surcharges. My last audit in Bahrain Bay showed savings of 22% using bundled service agreements.\
For a full breakdown, see this Bahrain company formation cost guide.\
Step-by-Step Waste Management Compliance: The Insider’s Guide\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.\
- Specify waste types and estimated monthly volumes. Use your lease agreement’s square footage and staff headcount as the basis (shortcut: use last year’s SCE median for your sector as a baseline)\
- Get your waste and recycling vendors’ SCE approval numbers in writing.\
Step 2: Sijilat Portal Submission\
\
Log in to Sijilat; choose ‘Environmental Clearance’\

Contact 2–3 SCE-listed waste contractors; negotiate bundled rates for mixed waste and recycling.\
Ensure your agreement includes digital certificate generation—no paper trails accepted anymore.\
\
Step 4: Audit Readiness\
\
Set up monthly internal waste tracking (spreadsheet or SCE web tool)\
Book an annual compliance review with your accounting service (recommended partners)\
\
Step 5: Ongoing Compliance\
\
Assign a local “environmental compliance officer”—even if it’s just the office manager\
Join sector WhatsApp groups run by the Bahrain Chamber; news of pop-up audits or SCE visits travels fast\
\
Insider tip: Offices in Bahrain Bay and Diplomatic Area process compliance certificates ~30% faster than outlying districts. Consider this when shopping for your first lease.\
Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\
But even seasoned founders trip up. The most frequent blunder is failing to register your waste contractor before starting fit-out work. I learned this the hard way when our SCE inspection found construction debris piled in our leased parking space. Fast fix: call your SCE contact before your moving date, and pre-register contractors using the landlord’s vendor letters—saves days of delays.\
Another pitfall: not updating your waste volumes after company expansion. SCE fines can be backdated—a costly oversight if you double staff in one quarter.\

Let’s be honest: most seniors don’t wake up in the morning excited to learn about Medicare.

They’re already buried under TV ads, postcards, and phone calls. Half the time, they’re just trying to figure out who they can actually trust.

That’s where **educational events** come in.

# Why They Work

When you run a “Medicare 101” workshop, you’re not selling — you’re teaching.

* A library room with 10 people and coffee.
* A church hall with 20 folks sitting in folding chairs.
* Or even a Zoom call with someone’s grandkids hovering in the background.

It doesn’t matter if you’ve got a fancy slideshow or just a whiteboard marker that’s running out of ink. What matters is this: **you’re the one who makes Medicare less confusing.**

That’s the difference between another salesperson and the trusted guide they remember.

# The Compliance Piece

CMS is clear about this: if it’s an **educational event**, it cannot be promoted or run as a sales event.

* You don’t hand out enrollment forms.
* You don’t pitch a specific plan.
* You don’t steer the conversation to a carrier.

You answer questions. You explain timelines. You walk through the difference between Part A, B, C, and D without turning it into alphabet soup.

And here’s the beauty — if someone wants a one-on-one conversation afterward, they’ll ask for it. You didn’t push. They pulled.

# Build Trust

1. **Cognitive fluency (clarity):** The more simply you explain Medicare, the smarter you look. If they understand you, they trust you.
2. **Specificity:** “Our next event is Thursday at the Maple Street Senior Center, 6–7 PM” is more credible than “We do workshops all the time.” Details build trust.
3. **Vulnerability:** Don’t be afraid to admit, “I know this stuff can feel overwhelming — even I had to read the rules three times when I started in the business.” That honesty makes you human.

# How to Start

* **Pick a date.** Don’t overthink it.
* **Find a room.** Libraries, senior centers, churches — they’re usually glad to host.
* **Keep it short.** 30–45 minutes with time for Q&A.
* **Promote it simply.** A flyer, a Facebook post, an email, a newsletter.

Remember, the goal isn’t to impress people with how much you know — it’s to make them feel safe enough to ask their questions.

Okay Karachi fam, I need help.

I’ve got a first date coming up and I want to avoid the classic awkward “sooo…nice weather, huh?” vibes. My master plan: Jenga. Because nothing breaks the ice like pulling a shaky wooden block while pretending your hand isn’t shaking from nerves.

Requirements:
1. Coffee shop that actually has board games (just Jenga will do, I’m a simple soul).
2. Medium-sized space: not a tiny 2-table spot where everyone can hear us overanalyzing each other’s coffee orders, but not Dolmen Mall food court either. Think Sync vibes.
3. Please don’t say Floc… love their vibe but let’s be honest, the coffee is…mid.

Does Karachi even have coffee spots with board games or do I need to carry my own Jenga set in a tote bag like some unhinged Pinterest person? 😭 (I don’t wanna do thatttt) 

How is June? Do they have board games? 

Help me out, my dating life is in your hands (literally).

1nbtb8l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nbtb8l,Tahiti & Moorea Holiday - Feb 2025,"Long overdue - I got a lot of good tips and information from the community and want to give back

**Tahiti – Kon Tiki Boutique Hotel (1 night)**

We landed in Tahiti from SFO around 8pm. Immigration and luggage took about 30 minutes since we were near the front of the plane. Taxis are easy to find and about $40 USD to the hotel.

We stayed at the Kon Tiki Boutique Hotel because the ferries weren’t running that late (next time I’d try to time this better). It worked out fine though — the hotel was a great stopover, and breakfast the next morning was delicious. Breakfast buffet was included at the hotel and was very good. Before heading to the ferry we walked to Papeete Market, which was nearby along with an ATM and a bunch of shops in case you need anything. They also have an ice cream cart on the walk there that had great mango ice cream.   
  
The ferry was directly across the street from the hotel, and you don’t need to arrive a full 60 minutes early — 20 minutes is plenty. They also sell food and drinks onboard.

**Moorea – Hilton Moorea Lagoon & Resort (2 nights)**

We took the 45-minute ferry over to Moorea, then a $40 taxi to the Hilton. The ride was smooth (not rocky at all if you’re worried about motion sickness). Check-in wasn’t until 2 or 3pm, so we grabbed lunch across the street at Lilikoi Garden Café. The food was good, but the mosquitos were plentiful :(

Our garden-view room was spacious and comfortable, with an extra bed already set up for our 9-year-old. The pool was heated, snorkeling right off the beach was fantastic, and they had kayaks available too.

We rented a car the next day and hiked Magic Mountain. It’s a steep, hot 45-minute round trip, but the panoramic views at the top made it worth it. Later, we swam at Hauru Public Beach and stopped at Captain Taina’s Pier hoping to see turtles and rays — no luck that day, and the currents were pretty strong.

For food, Snack Mahana was so goood — garlic shrimp and tuna sashimi were amazing (cash only!). Dinner at Rudy’s was also excellent, and they even provided a free shuttle to and from the Hilton.

**Bora Bora – St. Regis (5 nights)**

The next morning, we took the ferry back to Papeete for our Air Tahiti flight to Bora Bora. Ferry is really rocky if raining. The ferry terminal had a free shuttle (15-20 min) to Faa’a Airport, and with only two gates, check-in and boarding were super quick — an hour before is plenty. The duration between ferry arrival and our flight was long, and the airport didn’t have much to do or eat. I’d suggest not heading to the boarding area until closer to departure since there is even less food past security.

Our flight was delayed due to heavy rain but still went out (Air Moana flights were canceled with long lines at their desk). Tip: sit on the **left side** of the plane for the best views. Air Tahiti has open seating.

At Bora Bora airport, the St. Regis team greeted us with evian water and flower leis. After grabbing our luggage, we hopped on the resort boat and were off. Check-in was seamless, and our butler gave us a quick resort tour a golf cart on the before taking us to the room.

*Resort & Food*

From the moment we arrived, the service was incredible. Everyone — butlers, housekeeping, front desk, restaurant staff — went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We were celebrating our 10-year anniversary, and the team made it really special with flowers and a bottle of champagne. We sent them a photo we wanted to recreate from 9 years ago with our son, and they also framed it for us and placed it in the room before we arrived.

We did full board for 2 adults and 1 child. Lunch and dinner were allowed for 3 courses for adults. Way more food than you need. Breakfast was a buffet with extra items (eggs and pancakes) you could order, and while the spread was the same every day, it was high quality and filling. Lunch had one restaurant option (shared by the friendly resort cat), and dinners any of the restaurants (Lagoon had an upcharge). Lagoon was definitely worth it — great food and views of the Mt Otemanu. They also have polynesian night for local food and dancing. We had bamboo and Farniente which were both good. 

I loved the little touches, like sunscreen and aloe dispensers on the beach and mosquito spray available everywhere. The spa was a highlight — hot tub, sauna, and steam room, even without a treatment. The gym was new and well-equipped too.

Our overwater bungalow was amazing — we could see rays and fish right from the deck. The resort also offered lots of activities like marine life talks, wine tastings, and flower weaving. Each villa came with bikes, which we loved using to get around instead of walking or waiting for a cart.

*Excursions*

We visited a pearl farm (review here: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/yaCgcYUL43rZFLrr5](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yaCgcYUL43rZFLrr5?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) and did a private Shark, Ray, Elmo, and Reef excursion, which was unforgettable. We saw a lot of marine life and they dropped us off in town afterward where we had lunch, shopped a bit, then took the hotel shuttle boat back (sign up in advance).

*Areas of Improvement*

Service overall was fantastic, but a couple things stood out. Our toilet backed up for a few days without being permanently fixed, and one morning our coffee service request never arrived. Small issues, but noticeable at a resort like the St. Regis.

Also, the property is starting to show its age. The overwater villas especially are a bit dated, and a refresh would help keep the luxury feel.

**Summary**

Tahiti and Bora Bora truly surpassed our expectations. For anyone on the fence, I can’t recommend it enough — it’s idyllic, and the surreal photos you see online actually come to life here. The people, the scenery, and the fresh food all made it unforgettable. This is a trip we’ll cherish forever, and we’ll definitely be back.",11,1757350884.0,Tahiti,1,1.0,False

**Story Blurb:**

Nyx and Aether should be natural enemies. She's an Ignithari: a demon whose inner light makes her an outcast in Hell. He's an Eternum: an angel whose darkness marks him as defective in Heaven. When mythology professor Eden Thorne is murdered during a lecture on ancient prophecies, these two reluctant outcasts find themselves thrown together by circumstances neither expected. What starts as hesitant cooperation becomes something neither realm has a name for, as they discover their supposed flaws might be exactly what an ancient prophecy has been waiting for. But as their connection deepens and reality begins to fracture around them, they must choose: remain loyal to the realms that reject them, or risk everything for a bond that could either save all worlds—or destroy them.

**Content Warnings:**

* Moderate fantasy violence (including a murder scene, supernatural combat, and mentions that a particular mission may be 'suicidal')
* Romance/Emotional Intimacy
* Themes of religious/cosmic conflict (note: while drawing some inspiration from traditional sources, this creates its own unique mythology rather than following standard Christian/religious tropes)

**Type of Feedback I'm Looking For:**

I'm primarily seeking general reader reaction and pacing feedback. Specific areas I'd appreciate input on:

* Does the world-building feel cohesive and immersive without being overwhelming?
* Are the romantic/relationship developments believable given the supernatural circumstances?
* Does the mystery surrounding the prophecy maintain tension throughout?
* How well do the fantasy elements integrate with the modern urban setting?
* Are Nyx and Aether's character arcs satisfying and well-developed?

I'm also interested in any plot holes you might catch or areas where motivations feel unclear.

**Short Excerpt:**

*The skies above had been wrong for weeks.*

*With coffee cooling on the table, Eden Thorne, in her pajamas, sat on her apartment balcony, marveling at the improbably intricate cloud formations. Across the horizon, perfect geometric shapes stretched, dissolved and reformed with incredible mathematical precision. A strange calm lingered in the morning air, like the world itself was paused, holding its breath.*

*No one else seemed to notice.*

*She'd checked every scientific outlet available to her, examined every weather service and even scoured social media platforms. Nothing. Just complaints about unexpected temperature swings—either too cold or too hot for this time of year. Her camera, when photographing the sky, showed only unremarkable clouds; the lens failed to record what her eyes saw with such clarity.*

*She murmured to the sky, ""You're not as clever as you think,"" the rising steam from her coffee momentarily blurring her view of the perfectly hexagonal arrangement. ""Someone else is bound to notice, eventually.""*

*Like a living organism acknowledging her challenge, the cluster of hexagons pulsed once in response. Through neighboring formations, a brief glow sent ripples and subtle color shifts that defied weather system explanations.*

*Eden had seen strange things her entire life—flickers at the edge of reality, patterns where there should be none—but nothing this bold, this sustained. A change was subtly altering the careful balance that kept the world running.*

*Sometimes she wondered if she was seeing things as they truly were, beneath the curtain that everyone else accepted as the full scope of existence. What she didn't say aloud, what she barely acknowledged even to herself, was how sometimes the patterns seemed to recognize her in return, as if the cosmos itself was aware of her watching.*

**Timeline:**

I'm hoping for feedback within 6 weeks, though I'm flexible if you need a bit more time.

**Additional Info:**

* Complete manuscript at 79,512 words
* First book in a planned series
* Available in whatever format works best for you (Google Docs, Word doc, PDF, etc.)
* Looking for big-picture feedback rather than line edits

1nbt90i,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEarReviews/comments/1nbt90i/explore_best_stainless_steel_coffee_maker_presto/,Explore Best Stainless Steel Coffee Maker Presto 02811 Worth It?,"The Presto 02811 coffee maker became a daily companion in my kitchen over the past month, and let me tell you, it’s one of those gadgets that quickly sneaks into your routine without you even realizing it. Brewing coffee is a sacred ritual in my house, so the promise of a 12-cup stainless steel percolator that combines style, functionality, and speed had me intrigued. The Presto 02811 managed to check a lot of boxes for me, though there were a couple of quirks along the way that may be worth noting if you’re considering it.

**Stunning Design Meets Practicality**  
The stainless steel construction of this coffee maker immediately caught my eye. It has that timeless, hotel-style elegance that feels premium, especially if you enjoy setting up a good-looking breakfast or coffee spread. The traditional design enhances its aesthetic appeal and honestly got compliments from guests when I had friends over for brunch. It’s not just about looks either; the material feels durable and easy to clean. I found myself appreciating the way the steel polish stays shiny after a quick wipe-down. If you’re someone who dreads fingerprints or dull surfaces, this coffee maker has your back.

**Efficient Coffee Brewing**  
The real test, of course, was in how it could transform coffee grounds into the rich, flavorful brew I’ve come to depend on. With a brewing capacity of two to twelve cups, this machine quickly became versatile enough for both solo mornings and entertaining guests. Brewing at a rate of one cup per minute, it is faster than my previous coffee makers, which could take what felt like forever when I overcommitted to a full pot. The indicator light—situated at the base—makes life extra convenient by signaling when the coffee is ready. I especially appreciate not needing to stand around guessing if the coffee was done. Who has time on weekday mornings for surprises?

[Check Presto 02811 price on Amazon.](https://sohdu.com/p/b00df5honi/)

**Positives**  
- Stainless steel components, including the filter basket and perk tube, ensure durability.
- Brews coffee quickly, maintaining a hot serving temperature afterward.  
- Traditional, elegant design doubles as functional table service.  
- User-friendly operation with a clear indicator light.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The coffee maker’s power cord is removable, which is a great feature for storage, but the connector feels slightly loose when plugged in. It didn’t fall out, but the fit isn’t as snug as I’d hoped.  
- Cleaning the nooks and crannies of the perk spout can be tricky without the right tools, like a pipe cleaner or brush. Prepare for a bit of extra effort if you're meticulous like I am.  

**Fitting All Morning Coffee Preferences**  
This coffee maker aims to please with its ability to tailor itself to different drinkers. The reusable filter is a nice eco-friendly option and spares you from having to stock up on disposable ones. I personally tried brewing varying quantities over the week and was pleasantly surprised—whether it’s two cups to jumpstart my groggy mornings or a full 12-cup batch for Sunday breakfast with the family, the quality remained consistent. While it isn’t specifically advertised for fancy brewing techniques like iced coffee or cold brew, it nailed the job for classic hot batches.

**Product Contenders**  
In the world of percolators, some competition includes models from Farberware and Cuisinart. Farberware’s stainless steel percolators provide similar brewing times, but I found the Presto model’s simplicity and ease of setup preferable—no extra frills, which is frankly what I wanted. Cuisinart's options, on the other hand, integrate modern features like digital displays, but they tend to inch toward a higher price point. While the Presto lacks digital enhancements, it thrives in keeping coffee brewing straightforward and efficient. For someone prioritizing a balance of quality and budget, this product held its own.

**True Value**  
If I were to judge the value of the Presto coffee maker based purely on its features and performance, I’d call it a smart investment. Despite its premium-looking design, it remains reasonably affordable compared to other percolators offering similar functionality. Its simplicity and easy maintenance add to its appeal for those who want great coffee without a crash course in proper machine care. The durability of the stainless steel materials adds bonus points in my book as well, as I’m not about to replace kitchen appliances every couple of years. Considering the ongoing costs of other brewing methods, like single-serve pods or paper filters, this coffee maker turns out to be quite economical long-term.

1nbt8yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/1nbt8yq/am_i_actually_thawing_meat_in_an_unsafe_way_or_is/,"Am I actually thawing meat in an unsafe way, or is this just one of those technically against the rules but fine in practice things?","

So this is something I’ve always done and never really thought about until recently

. I usually cook just for myself, not for a partner or family, and I realized my thawing method is technically something people say is “wrong.”

Here’s what I do If I need bacon, sausages, or a small pack of ground beef (basically anything under a pound), I’ll run it under the hottest tap water for about 5–10 minutes. By then, it’s completely thawed, I cook it immediately, it tastes fine, and I’ve never once gotten sick.

I’d never do this with a whole chicken, ham, turkey, or any big cut of meat  that feels unsafe. But with small portions? They thaw through so fast they’re not sitting half frozen half warm for long.

The “official” advice is always fridge overnight or cold water. I get it, that’s the safest across the board. But what I don’t understand is why is hot water supposed to be so dangerous in this exact scenario? Ten minutes in hot water doesn’t magically spoil bacon or sausage. If I pour milk into hot coffee, it doesn’t suddenly become unsafe an hour later.

And just to clarify  nobody’s health has ever been at risk but my own in these situations. I’ve only ever done this when cooking for myself, since I’m not in a relationship and don’t have kids. If I were making food for others, I’d stick to the conventional safe methods without question. But for me

 personally, it’s worked for years without a single issue.

So is this genuinely unsafe in practice, or is it just one of those overly strict food safety rules that’s meant to cover worst case situations like giant roasts or people thawing and then forgetting to cook right away?

Because honestly, I’ve been doing this for years and have never once had a problem gotten sick or spoiled the taste of the food .

Also why I don't use a microwave to dethaw it is -it semi cooks the meat and drys it out-

I only have the former ATM. 

After struggling with nighttime wakefulness (some remembered, some not) for months, I made an appointment to get another sleep study and hopefully get more support with titration. Clinics all booked out the wazoo and I can’t even do the study until basically December. 

Spent some time sleeping without CPAP as it had begun stressing me out and preventing me from sleeping in comfortable positions for my back pain. That made it easier to fall asleep but obviously didn’t fix or improve the problem.  

I do see other specialists routinely to manage other conditions—one is ADHD and my psychiatrist, after repeatedly stressing the meds can’t do much if I’m not sleeping and I need to see a sleep specialist, and me repeating that I am doing everything I possibly can, prescribed me 50mg trazadone to get me through the next few months.

I took it for the first time last night and gave the CPAP another shot for the first time in about a week. I felt super relaxed and drifted right off to sleep. Went to sleep very easily and do not remember any waking. Apple Watch also showed no nighttime wakefulness which is VERY unusual for my Apple Watch sleep reports, as well as higher percentages of deep sleep and REM than it usually reports. 

BUT. This morning I had the same dreadful sleep inertia I have been battling ever since the sleep problems started. It wasn’t at maximum badness but it was well within the normal range of insanely bad sleep inertia. Felt almost like right before you fall into sleep paralysis, like that kind of weak exhaustion you can’t resist (even though no paralysis followed). I was in bed, and this time seemingly getting more sleep and less/no awake time, for 9 hours!

Also, I am dealing with daytime sleepiness still!  I feel like I want to go take a nap despite being on ADHD meds and having caffeinated coffee AND 9 hours of allegedly the best sleep I’ve had in months.

1nbt615,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nbt615,August 26-30 Recap & Recommendations,"Acadia is just absolutely stunning and I will think about this trip for a long time. Some thoughts and recommendations:

-I was nervous that the crowds would be insane seeing so many posts about it. Going into a major holiday weekend, I was pleasantly surprised. It was definitely crowded in the afternoons but the park is massive so there’s tons of hikes to do where you’ll still be the only ones. If you want to hit the big attractions, I do think it’s worth going earlier in the morning or evenings.

-HIGHLY recommend taking the shuttle system. It’s easy and gets you really anywhere you want to go in the park. It’s also nice to just sit for a bit after some hard hikes. We only drove in the morning for beehive and a few evenings. 

-Beehive was 100% worth doing as someone who has a big fear of heights/falling from heights. It wasn’t as scary as I thought and you are moving the whole time so you don’t have much time to think about the heights. We got there before 8 and it was definitely less crowded. 

-We just did the Cadillac sunset and it was amazing. I’m sure the sunrise is beautiful but I was totally satisfied with watching the sunset. The drive up is a bit scary!

-We wanted to do an activity on the water and were looking at whale watching tours, kayaking and paddle boarding. Someone told us the whale tours could take 5 hours so we opted for something where we could move more. We rented air pump paddle boards and took them to a lake and seal harbor beach! It was so fun. 

-Bar harbor is a great town and while it got very crowded towards the end of the week, it wasn’t bothersome in any way. It was great walking and sitting along the water. All of the stores are cute and there’s great food. We didn’t set any reservations but ended up eating earlier (5ish) and never had to wait anywhere. We loved the popovers at stadium bar and the BEST lobster rolls were at bar harbor lobster pound (great vibe too). Tried a different coffee shop everyday (all were great) and the sweet bite cookies were unreal. ",9,1757350567.0,acadianationalpark,4,1.0,False

1) NTUC / 7-11 - I’m considering getting mangosteens back because we’re 3 people now so can bring quite a lot. Anything else worth bringing back home? 

 2) Watsons / guardians - will stock up on aneesa sunscreens. What else to get? 
The parent company ? I have seen them get really popular on Instagram, but google reviews say otherwise. 

3) Gonna try these places - Dopa Dopa, birds of paradise gelato, Maxwell hawker centre, pita bakery, fore coffee, green dot, elemen, nomvnom, whole earth. 

4) Daiso / Typo 

5) of course i’ll go to other popular shopping centres.

First month went well then noticed the machine started to sound like it was working too hard, which got progressively worse over time. This resulted in rough-sounding noises from the machine, burnt coffee taste and super watery pucks. Did all the typical cleaning procedures (descaling, cleaning all components including brew unit, etc) but no difference. Troubleshooting with Delonghi didn't help either.

As a last resort, I decided to take the brew unit apart. When I did that, out fell two separate screen filters with gunk built up between them. Went through as many disassembly/reassembly YouTube videos as I could and I couldn't find anyone else that had 2 filters. So I ended up putting it back together with only 1 (after cleaning it thoroughly) and the machine seems to be running better now.

My question is, should it have had 2 screen filters in the first place and should I have put the 2nd one back? Or is this just one of those bad luck manufacturing defects? Thanks in advance! ",1,1757350262.0,DeLonghi,3,1.0,False

Carl gave up his YouTube channel about two months ago because he felt it was ""getting in the way of his Christian faith."" He wanted to quit.

However, there's a twist: he has privated his videos (he admitted this), but his channel is still up. Yesterday, he unprivated some of the videos and started making new content. We discussed this in the kitchen while he was eating and I was enjoying a coffee. Since our mom got a new couch and loveseat, we're not allowed to eat or drink in the living room, but we can watch TV in the kitchen. 

During our conversation, he randomly mentioned wanting to start YouTube again and asked me to never watch his videos in front of him. This was a request he made before he quit YouTube. He wanted to be famous, but he hated it when I watched his videos in front of him. He has 1k ahd I know that's still small compared to others so whenever I was alone in my room, if I saw a video of his on my feed, I'd watch it to support him. 

I know views help, so I watch his videos in my room or when he's not home. He posts content I personally don’t enjoy, but I wanted to support him. So when he brought up the request again in the kitchen, he snapped at me, saying, ""You were the reason I gave up YouTube."" He was snarky and his voice was accusing. 

This confused me, so I asked about his ""channel getting in the way of Jesus"" reason. He replied that was one reason, but I was the main reason because he knew I was watching his videos in my room, and it annoyed him.

I got annoyed and told him, ""You can't blame me for your quitting. I respected your request and never watched your videos in front of you. You shouldn't let others make you feel that strongly to quit. I knew how much your dream of being a Youtuber/singer meant to you. But you should have quit because it felt right for *you*. It hurts my feelings that you snapped at me. I apologize if you overheard me from my room, but that's my space, not yours. It’s not like I ask you to come to my room and see me watching your stuff. You’re acting childish over a channel, and I don’t want to be blamed for your quitting again.""

He accused me of playing the victim, so I took my coffee and went to my room. I still don’t understand what just happened, and I need outside opinions.

He's not hitting millions or billions and I never said this to him but I feel like he gave up because he wasn't getting the views he needed to be sucessful so he could be famous and get money from Youtube. I never said this out loud but I feel like he's taking it out on me.

Just moved into a new place in a new city. I have been going to coffee shops and I seriously need to stop so I can save some money. 

My coffee consumption is 95% iced. I live somewhere that is 85+ degrees year round and I just enjoy it more. I like Iced Americanos, iced Lattes, Cold Brew, Black coffee, drip coffee. 

This is my conundrum. I only need a small machine because I will most likely be the only person using it. I am torn between getting a Nespresso Vertuo (chrome) or a Breville Bambino. I have pulled espresso shots before so I am confident in that aspect. 

I like the Breville because its mainly metal. Idk why $200 for a hunk of plastic Nespresso and additional pods just seems extremely wasteful to me. I've read on other threads that Nespresso Vertuo can be $1 - $1.50 per pod and the pods can only be purchased online which is a hugeeeeee downside to me. BUT  I worry the breville bambino is maybe too much for just making silly little iced drinks.

Any thoughts would be helpful.

1nbsyj7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nbsyj7,bakes from this week!,"First: three cheese!

400g bread flour
100g whole wheat
10g salt
350g cold water
100g starter
About 350g shredded cheese (didn't measure, just added based on ✨vibes✨) 

Process: mixed starter with water, salt, and flour. Left to hydrate for 30 minutes. 4 stretch and folds over the next 2 hours, added a handful of cheese during the last 2 stretch and folds. Bulk fermented in the oven with the light on for about 5-6 hours? Preshaped, then rested for about 30 minutes. During final shape, I added another 2 handfuls of cheese. Cold fermented for about 12hrs. When I slashed for baking, I added a sprinkle of cheese into the slash. Baked at 450°F for 30 minutes, then at 425°F for 20 minutes. 

Second: Double Chocolate and Coffee

Based on a recipe from Simplicity and a Starter, except I changed my entire water weight to strong coffee (I used instant), and upped the starter & salt weights. I also used a black cocoa powder, and approximately 300g of mini chocolate chips. 

470g bread flour 
350g coffee (original recipe called for 50g of espresso & 325g water)
10g salt 
30g black cocoa powder 
55g brown sugar 
75g starter (recipe called for 50g)
300g mini chocolate chips 

Process: mixed starter, coffee, sugar, and cocoa powder together before adding flour and salt. Similar process for bulk ferment & cold ferment as the three cheese and WW/BF loaf (since I made them all at once). I added chocolate chips in a similar fashion, and used the same baking process. 

What I would change next time: up my water (coffee) to 375g, I forgot that black cocoa powder is really thirsty! The dough was a lot stiffer then I expected. I'd also move from dark brown sugar to white, as I found the combo with the dark cocoa powder to be a bit overwhelming in terms of taste, and white would play nicer. 

Third: my classic recipe!

400g bread flour
100g whole wheat flour
10g salt
350g cold water
100g starter

Process: exact same as other 2 loaves, including baking. 


All of these loaves will be claimed by family/friends, since I don't like bread much, so I'm waiting on feedback! Especially for the double chocolate and coffee loaf. I plan to give the second try loaves to the same people so they can let me know how the changes taste.

2nd they are reviewing for board exam and i offer them unlimited questions and drills they can practice with, 
3rd Some of graduates are gonna take like mga unique licensure exam na walang nag ooffer sa review center, and let me tell you, any resources they can have they'll get it. 

Ganun ka desperado ang makapasa sa board exam. I just offer simple solution sa presyong ice coffee, pero bakit hinde nalang ako gumawa ng flash cards nalang or test banks? If gagawa ako nun, stuck lng ako sa single college course.

And yes i use ai to make the prompt, but not in a way lahat na, i research the TOS ng board exam for example criminology, and list all the topics inside cluster them into their own parts. I have designed some kind of prompt na consistent lagi ang results and use ai to polished it, and pag dudugtungin ko nalang sila.

So dont hate on me, of course I'll be here on reddit on a community called sidehustle, I'm not gonna sell on my tiktok account a bundle. Imagine mo crim student gusto ng pang crim lng na prompt then sasabihin ko would you like prompt for teacher, nurse, radtech, medtech, agri, etc etc. for 800?!

I kept it simple: rent, utilities, groceries, gas, savings. I gave myself a small “fun” category too so I wouldn’t completely burn out. I figured I’d give up halfway like I always do, but this time something clicked.

Three months later, I’ve managed to save $750, which is insane to me because before I’d barely keep $50 in my account by the end of the month. The biggest change wasn’t some magical hack, it was tracking every dollar. Even dumb stuff, like grabbing a coffee or a late-night Uber.

Yesterday I had a problem with my aunt after asking her not to come again. She told me there was a water failure at her house and asked if she could come wash her clothes at my place. I asked, “just you?” and she said, “yeah, just my clothes”. Since I know she lives with my other aunt, their brother, and her daughter (4 people total), I wanted to be sure.

When she arrived, she showed up with 6 huge bags of blankets, plus 4 more full of clothes. On top of that, she brought everyone with her. I live in a small duplex made for 2 (with a terrace), and she said since I had the terrace, it was a good day to wash all the blankets. I was shocked, but I tried to stay calm.

Culturally, being Italian, I was raised to respect “authority” figures in the family, like my aunts, so speaking against them feels wrong. That’s why I kept myself shut. But during the day, my aunt kept asking me to prepare lunch, then coffee, then cakes, I felt overwhelmed. Both my aunts spent the whole day washing, their brother just lied on my couch watching TikToks, and her daughter slept in my bed the whole day with my dog. Meanwhile, I spent my entire day off cooking for them.

At night, my aunt said, “sorry we kinda ruined your Sunday 😋” and I replied, “yes, you actually did… please don’t do it again” She got offended, called me disrespectful and ungrateful, and even brought up that she helped take care of my mom during pregnancy… 30 years ago! lol. I told her I was just agreeing with her, but she called me crazy. I asked her to calm down but she said she wasn’t coming again. Yet, they only left after finishing all their laundry ahahahh. 

Now I wonder if I went too far, but honestly, I was exhausted and couldn’t hold it in anymore, part of me feels relieved but the other part worries to ruin a relationship with my aunts over this ridiculous situation, I think they were being way too overfamiliar and I let it pass so it’s actually my fault. I’m not a problematic person and I’m very patient, but she gave me the chance to speak up my mind and she didn’t like it. 

I have told this situation to my mom and sister, and both said I was crazy and I should have managed the situation better, but what is a better way? Having this reaction from my family is what keeps me asking myself if it’s me who is wrong. ",2,1757349841.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

1nbsr7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1nbsr7j/no_one_knows_just_one_person_an_essay_about/,No One* Knows Just One Person-- An essay about connections,"Every now and then, here or in one of the other digital spaces, someone shares their story about breaking in.

""I just sold my script about a woman who goes back to her small hometown and discovers her childhood sweetheart, and everyone else in the town, are now zombies!""

In the midst of the congratulations, most genuine, will come the most loaded question in existence: *How did it happen?*

The naive scribe will recount the tale. ""My cousin's dentist's wife works for a studio, and they've been looking for a horror comedy they can shoot in this rural neighborhood they bought for no good reason, and the actress they want to attach can't get rid of her southern accent to save her life!""

And that's when it begins. The chorus of doomsdayers.

*I don't have a cousin.*  
*All the dentists I know are old gay men or swingers.*  
*I use AI for all of my dentistry now.*

All of these \[completely irrelevant to the celebration of the OP\] responses are code for the same thing-- *I'll never have that kind of luck.*

And you're right. That exact same scenario will probably never happen to you, even if you go to five dentists a year. But what the OP doesn't mention in the story are all of the other people she's encountered that could have also led to her big break but didn't:

The Oscar-winning writer who taught her screenwriting class.  
The son of an exec she works with at Applebee's.  
The manager she served at Applebee's who DID ask to read her script several years ago but it wasn't ready.

They also didn't mention they've been going to this dentist, who knew she was a writer, for twelve years before he offered to share her work.

Opportunity = luck + preparation. Or something like that.

The point it, it's never\* just **one** person, one event, one meeting that changes your life. There is always a series of events and relationships before, and after, the one that turns the tide. To be cliché and use running analogies, so many people think if they sprint from door to door, maybe they'll find one that's open, and the people inside are totally cool with a stranger just barging in.

But, as they say, this is a marathon. A weird one where you keep stopping and knocking on doors as you go. And sometimes people don't answer when you knock, but they see you when you're walking the path to prepare for the next race and they invite you in for coffee. In this analogy, stranger danger is totally cool and safe.

So stop comparing. Stop being desperate. Stop finding every excuse you can for why you won't succeed. Because if that's your mindset, an industry where, if the highs and lows were mapped and turned into a rollercoaster ride it would not pass inspection is probably not for you.

And if that's the case, that's okay, too.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 31M and from the UK.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day 🤭. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath 🤗.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. 

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

A little info about me so you know I'm not just a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!

- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play video games. I'm obsessed with Satisfactory at the moment.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

1nbskij,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nbskij/hr_i_did_not_hurt_them/,[HR] I did not Hurt Them,"Look, we’ve all fallen into the social media trap of doom scrolling, sometimes maybe even for hours on end. We as a human species have reached a point in our timeline where every ounce of our day could be consumed by the small computer that we each conceal in our pockets. I’m no different than anyone else; I, too, have succumbed to this trap on multiple occasions, too many to even count.

But there’s something evil within these apps. I don’t know what it is or how it works. Hell, this may be a demon designated to me alone. Or an AI, who knows at this point? All I know is the other night, I was lying in bed after a long day’s work, trying to unwind and scroll some reels. Everything was normal for the first hour or so; the usual car accidents, shitposts, and memes. However, as I fell deeper into the doomscrolling, I came across a video that just showed…me..? Sitting at the dinner table with my brother and parents. The table was set beautifully, and my mother had prepared a nice meal of what seemed to be meatloaf, a meal she had never cooked before.

I was completely stunned. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, and the video went on for 10 straight minutes, just showing us as we ate quietly. Once every plate was cleaned, and we all started to get up to walk away, the video restarted back to the beginning. I rushed to my parents’ room to show them what I’d found, but by the time I got there, the feed had refreshed entirely.

I mean, how do you even explain that to someone, “hey, I just saw us eating dinner on Instagram, that’s probably something to look out for,” like what? No. Luckily, though, I had remembered the username. I typed user.44603380 into the Instagram search bar, and only one account popped up. When I clicked on it, I was baffled to find that there were no posts made at all, just a blank page. However, there was one clear sign of evidence that I was looking in the right place: the profile picture. See, this account had zero followers, zero following, and everything about the page looked grey and new. Everything except for the profile picture, which was me, yet again, staring into the camera for a photo I did not take. My face was soulless and hollow. Barely maintaining the essence of a human.

This was clear evidence, though, and I ran to show my parents again. I was profoundly disappointed when both my mom and dad insisted that it had to be one of my friends playing some kind of prank on me. I don’t know why I expected either of them to understand. I mean, they’re parents, what do they know about social media? Nevertheless, I reported the account for pretending to be someone else, and by the next morning, it had been taken down. Relieved, I went to work with warmth in my chest.

When I got home, I repeated the process. Kicked my shoes off, plopped down on the bed, and began scrolling. This time, a good quarter of what I saw was me, posted from different, all-new accounts. None of the videos were actually me; they all captured me doing things that I had never once done. Walking a dog I never had, browsing at a library I’d never seen before, all taken from obscure angles like the person behind the camera was hiding.

Thoroughly creeped out, I reported every single page I came across. It totaled up to something like 30 different accounts, all dedicated to me, and I got the notification when each one had been taken down. I decided to take a break from the reels after that, putting my phone away in a drawer and going outside for some fresh air. I actually didn’t even pick up my phone again until it was time for work the next day.

When I did, a notification was displayed across the screen. I had been informed that my Instagram account had been taken down for “pretending to be someone else.” I didn’t know what to do, so I sent an appeal to Instagram and just went to work, albeit a little on edge. When I got off, I was astounded to find that my appeal had been rejected and that it would take 30 days before I could launch a new one.

Whatever, right, but I had a real problem going on, I couldn’t just not watch as it unfolded. I set up a basic new account and started scrolling. It didn’t take long before I found myself again. Getting coffee, stopping off for gas, interacting with people I’d never met. Eventually, that’s all that my new page consisted of: just videos of me every time I scrolled. There were now too many accounts to report all with that same random string of numbers username.

As I scrolled, the videos changed. I was no longer out doing the mundane. I was now walking down the road in every video. Walking down a road that I recognized as the one just before my actual neighborhood. Then it was in my driveway, then at my doorstep, then, as if nothing happened, back to the regular Instagram feed. Puppies, nature, advertisements. All the accounts were gone. All the videos were gone. And I felt like I was going crazy.

I tossed my phone to the side and just lay in my bed, staring up at the ceiling. I drifted off into deep thought, which eventually turned into sleep. When I awoke, I went through my normal process: getting dressed, making the bed, you know the deal. When I checked my phone, I stood utterly horrified as hundreds of videos showed up, all with thousands of views, all showing the third-person perspective of me murdering my parents.

I basically exploded out of my bedroom door to find the walls coated in blood, so much so that it appeared the walls were leaking with the crimson liquid. The smell of iron radiated throughout the entire house, and when I entered my parents’ bedroom, I found them sprawled across the bed, stab wounds decorating their bare torsos. Instagram still pulled up on my device, I heard as police sirens came flooding in through the phone’s speakers.

When I raised the screen to my face, I saw myself, standing over my parents’ bed, cellphone in hand. A mixture of confusion, desperation, and terror plastered across my face. That’s when the room began to flash red and blue as police lights came pouring in through the bedroom windows. A loud pounding came from the front door before it flew open and splintered as an armed SWAT unit came rushing in, rifles trained on me. They pinned me to the floor and my phone went flying from my hand, bouncing across the floor and landing propped up against the wall.

The last thing I saw on the feed was me being handcuffed before it refreshed back to the kittens and baking recipes. I was brought in for questioning, and my lawyer insisted I plead insanity. I’m writing this from a holding cell in a notebook, and I plan to have my lawyer publish it and send it out to wherever he can.

### Mouse Capone's Expeditions & Misadventures presents: The Legend of Iver Swan     
     
### Part 7: A Debrief Over Coffee

Mouse Capone and Archimedes Featherstone found themselves in a small, quiet café tucked away in a corner of Lower Manhattan. It was far from the towering skyscrapers and the high-stakes world of Monkey Tycoon, and for once, that was a relief.

The air smelled of roasted beans and pastries, a stark contrast to the tension-filled office they had just left behind. They sat at a corner table, away from the few patrons scattered throughout. A steaming cup of coffee sat between them as Archimedes carefully adjusted his spectacles and studied Mouse’s expression.

""You handled yourself well back there,"" Archimedes said, his voice calm and measured. ""Considering the situation, we could’ve lost much more.""

Mouse let out a long breath, leaning back in his chair. ""Maybe. But we didn’t win, did we?""

Archimedes took a thoughtful sip of his coffee. ""Winning, in this line of work, is often less about the clean outcome and more about surviving with your principles intact.""

Mouse scoffed, staring out the window at the bustling city beyond. ""Iver Swan. Who would’ve thought a swan could be so slick? He played us like amateurs, Arch.""

""He's clever, no doubt,"" Archimedes agreed, his fingers tracing the rim of his cup. ""But he's playing a long game. He has the schematics, but they're no good to him until he can find the right buyers—and that takes time. Time we can still use to our advantage.""

Mouse frowned. ""Monkey Tycoon didn’t seem too thrilled with that idea. He’s thinking about what Swan will do with those documents once they hit the market. That’s years of work gone in a flash. And the money? We’re talking tens of millions—maybe more.""

Archimedes nodded slowly, setting his cup down. ""True. But consider this—Swan is sitting on a ticking time bomb. He’s got to find a way to offload the information without making too many waves. He can’t cash in without drawing attention, and that means he’s going to be cautious, maybe even sloppy.""

Mouse rubbed his temples. ""But he still won. And we were sent in to protect that briefcase, not let some smooth-talking swan make off with it.""

Archimedes smiled faintly. ""Did he win? Or did we buy enough time to shift the board in our favor? Swan’s got a piece of the puzzle, but he doesn’t have all of it. There’s still a chance to turn this around.""

Mouse paused, looking at the professor. ""You think there’s more to this than we know, don’t you?""

Archimedes leaned forward slightly. ""The Temporal Callosum project wasn’t just about those documents, Mouse. It’s about the idea behind them. Monkey Tycoon can adapt. He always does. What Swan took—it’s valuable, yes, but it’s not the end. It’s a spark, nothing more.""

Mouse sat quietly, processing the professor's words. He knew Archimedes was right. Swan might have the documents, but the bigger game was still being played, and the final move hadn’t been made yet.

""Okay,"" Mouse said, leaning forward. ""What’s the next step? We just let him walk away with those plans?""

""For now,"" Archimedes replied. ""We regroup, keep our eyes on the broader picture. Swan will surface again, and when he does, we’ll be ready. We don’t need to catch him now. We just need to outlast him.""

Mouse chuckled softly. ""You make it sound simple.""

Archimedes smiled, his wise old eyes twinkling. ""It never is. But if anyone can handle it, it’s you and the crew.""

If social media makes us more awkward in real life, maybe quitting isn’t antisocial at all. Maybe it’s the only way to learn how to be social again.

The skyline, the coffee shops, the idea of finally earning my own money. Then you sit down at your office desk and realize… wow, this is it. This is what we all worked so hard for.

Day one, you’re full of energy, wearing your nice clothes, sipping overpriced coffee. Day one hundred? You’re just staring at spreadsheets, waiting for 6 PM like your life depends on it, and calculating how much GrabFood will drain from your sweldo.

The routine kills you slowly. Wake up, sit in traffic (or squeeze into MRT like sardinas), get to work, grind on something that doesn’t even feel meaningful, eat lunch you barely enjoy, grind again, go home tired, scroll on your phone, sleep, repeat. Weekends become your only lifeline but even those get eaten up by errands, chores, or “resting” just enough to prepare for another cycle.

The sad part is, your dreams start shifting. Before: “I’ll build big projects, innovate, maybe even make a difference.” Now: “Sana makabili ako ng decent condo before I hit 30.” Or worse: “Sana lang hindi ako magising late bukas.”

And it hits harder because in this country, the ladder feels broken. Promotions are slow, salaries don’t match cost of living, and every “benefit” feels like a band-aid. You start asking: Is this all there is? Am I supposed to just grind until I burn out, all while watching my twenties slip away?

I get why people leave. It’s not just the money. It’s the feeling that your youth, your energy, your big dreams — they all get worn down by a system that doesn’t really reward you for caring.

At 24, I’m already tired. And that scares me. Because if this is the start, what’s left by the time I hit 30, 40, 50?

I shower at night, and clean my face in the shower. When I get out, I put a teeny tiny amount of Cabtreo on my face and it burns a little when I rub it in. No big deal, I can deal with a mild burning sensation.

But when I rub moisturizer in over it, it is an EXTREME burning sensation - no matter what moisturizer I try. And in the morning when I wake up (after coffee, of course), I clean my face with micellar water and a cotton pad - no burning there. I skip serums/treatments in the morning, and just use moisturizer and sunscreen - and rubbing those products in also burns super badly. (The supergoop unseen sunscreen seems to hurt the least.)

(And not sad),"So I tried on a few dresses in store with my partner and couldn't find anything I like. I stumbled upon a shop online that hand makes dresses and I'm obsessed with their dresses that have lots of colorful embroidery and beading. 

My partner encouraged me to go ahead and order it, since it was the only dress I couldn't get out of my head. Now my dress is arriving and I'm filled with so many emotions! Excited, anxious, even sad. 

A big part of the reason why we are eloping is because I'm no contact with my family and can't keep a friend group. So for the dress try on (and everything else in my life), my mom and sisters won't be here. But if they were, they would make horrible comments about my appearance and the dress. So I'm not sure why I feel sad about them not being here. 


So far the plan is to do a morning try on. I am gonna do my hair and make up so I feel good. My partner is gonna get us some coffee (a treat for us). I'm making chocolate covered strawberries to have afterwards. We're gonna do the try on in the living room where we have a lot of natural light and Prince will be playing in the background. I am staying aware of the fact that it will likely need alterations. 


I have so many things I wish I had a mom or aunt or a trusted woman older than me that I could ask. Since my dress is being shipped, should I stream it when I open it? I have my shapewear, but what type of bra should I wear? How do those stick bras even go on?? Also, I know my partner is gonna tell me I'm beautiful, but it would be so nice to have a woman to get advice from. 

I'm sorry this is turning into a diary entry lol. If anyone has any recommendations on how to make a at home try on special, please let me know. ",3,1757348419.0,Eloping,1,1.0,False

1nbs6rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AfterOpening/comments/1nbs6rb/assess_cascade_dishwasher_detergent_pods_better/,Assess Cascade Dishwasher Detergent Pods Better Than Liquid?,"Dishwashing has always been a chore I secretly dreaded, but the introduction of the Cascade CASCADE4891 Platinum Dishwasher Detergent ActionPacs in our household has truly changed the game for me. As someone constantly looking for efficient products that simplify daily tasks, I knew I had to try these highly-rated dishwasher detergent pods. What stands out, as their description claims, is the promise of sparkling cleanliness without the messiness of traditional detergent powders or gels. Testing these pods daily brought about some unexpected surprises, both delightful and occasionally frustrating.

**Packaging and Design**  
At first glance, the packaging immediately felt practical, though not particularly innovative. The tub is compact enough to tuck neatly under the sink, measuring 8 x 5.5 x 7.5 inches, and weighing just over three pounds. I’ve appreciated how the package was sturdy and secured the pods—it eliminated any concern about accidental spillage. Each pod is pre-measured, eliminating the guessing game of how much detergent to scoop into the dishwasher. The scent, labeled as ""Fresh,"" isn’t overly overpowering but lingers subtly on the dishes after the cycle, leaving them smelling clean without unwanted chemical-like odors.

**Cleaning Performance**  
Using the Cascade ActionPacs was straightforward. I simply grabbed a pod and tossed it into my dishwasher’s detergent dispenser. Over the month of consistent use, I noticed that my dishes, particularly tough ones like casserole dishes and greased-up pans, came out far cleaner than they had with other detergents I’ve used previously. Even burnt-on marinara sauce on lasagna trays didn’t require a pre-soak—something I was elated to discover! While some older, heavily discolored mugs still had faint tea stains after completion, I was able to overlook those minor inconsistencies considering the performance on everyday glassware, cutlery, and plates.  

**Ease of Use and Convenience**  
I'll admit, some dishwasher detergents can get unnecessarily messy or require trial-and-error to portion properly. These pods eliminate all of that. As someone who juggles multiple responsibilities daily, the mess-free nature of these little ActionPacs saves me valuable time and energy. Plus, they’re incredibly easy for my teenage kids to use without the excuse of “not knowing how the dishwasher works.” That’s a win in itself!  

[Find the best price for Cascade CASCADE4891 on Amazon.](https://go.senaar.com/p/b07c64xdxg/)  

**Winning Points**  
- Effortless to use, making dish-cleaning a breeze.  
- Consistently leaves glassware sparkling and free of residue.  
- Handles tough food stains, even without pre-soaking dishes.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Some tea and coffee stains persist on older mugs despite regular use.  
- Pods sometimes do not fully dissolve in lower-end or outdated dishwashers.  
- The lingering ""Fresh Scent"" might not appeal to everyone, especially those sensitive to added fragrances.  

**Product Alternatives**  
When comparing these detergent pods to other products I’ve tried, such as Finish Quantum Tabs, there are a few notable distinctions. Finish tends to have a stronger fragrance and can tackle coffee stains more effectively, but it leaves a slightly soapy residue on some plastics, which I didn’t encounter with Cascade. On the other hand, generic detergent pods often lack the finesse and cleaning consistency of branded ones, making Cascade Platinum ActionPacs a worthy investment for frequent dishwashing tasks. It’s also worth noting that the Cascade pods perform beautifully in energy-efficient washers, which some competitor products reportedly struggle with.

**Cost Efficiency**  
In terms of value for money, the Cascade pods are moderately priced for the quality they deliver. While they are not the cheapest option out there, their performance somewhat justifies the extra expense. You are essentially paying for convenience, high efficiency, and a reliable clean without the need for additional rinse aids or pre-rinsing. Ultimately, it’s about cutting down not just on physical effort but also on water and energy waste. Would I repurchase them? Absolutely, though I might stock up when deals roll in!
